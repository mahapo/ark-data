The Tibetan Tengyur is a vast collection of over 3,600 classical Indian Buddhist scientific treatises (sastra) written in Sanskrit by over 700 authors from the first millennium CE, now preserved mainly in systematic 7th-12th century Tibetan translation. Its topics span all of India's \"outer\" arts and sciences, including linguistics, medicine, astronomy, socio-political theory, ethics, art, and so on, as well as all of her \"inner\" arts and sciences such as philo­sophy, psychology (\"mind science\"), meditation, and yoga. The present work is the cornerstone of a related series, which will comprise the Collected Works of Tsong Khapa Losang Drak pa (bLo bZang Grags pa, 1357-1419) and His Spiritual Sons, Gyaltsap (rGyal Tshab) Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) and Khedrup Gelek Pelsung (mKhas Grub dGelegs dPal bZang, 1385-1438), a collection known in Tibetan as rJey Yab Sras gSung 'Bum.

Their deep and vast study and practice explored the creative potential of the human mind with the aim of eliminating suffering and making life truly joyful and worthwhile. They composed numerous excellent and meaningful texts. I regularly recollect the kindness of these immaculate scholars and aspire to follow them with unflinching faith. At the present time, when there is great emphasis on scientific and technological progress, it is extremely important that those of us who follow the Buddha should rely on a sound understanding of his teaching, for which the great works of the renowned Nalanda scholars provide an indispensable basis. In their outward conduct the great scholars of Nalanda observed ethical discipline that followed the Pali tradition, in their internal practice they emphasized the awakening mind of bodhichitta, enlightened altruism, and in secret they practised tantra. The Buddhist culture that flourished in Tibet can rightly be seen to derive from the pure tradition of Nalanda, which comprises the most complete presentation of the Buddhist teach­ings. As for me personally, I consider myself a practitioner of the Nalanda tradition of wisdom. Masters of Nalanda such as Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Aryasaitga, Dharmakirti, Candrakirti, and Shantideva wrote the scriptures that we Tibetan Buddhists study and practice. They are all my gurus. When I read their books and reflect upon their names, I feel a connection with them. The works of these Nalanda masters are presently preserved in the collection of their writings that in Tibetan translation we call the Tengyur (bstan 'gyur). It took teams of Indian masters and great Tibetan translators over four centuries to accomplish the historic task of translating them into"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Tibetan. Most of these books were later lost in their Sanskrit originals, and relatively few were translated into Chinese. Therefore. the Tengyur is truly one of Tibet\"s most precious treasures, a mine of understanding that we have preserved in Tibet for the benefit of the whole world. Keeping all this in mind I am very happy to encourage a long-term project of the American Institute of Buddhist Studies, originally estab­lished by the late Venerable Mongolian Geshe Wangyal and now at the Columbia University Center for Buddhist Studies, and Tibet House US, to translate the Te ngyur-along with major works by great Tibetan scholars elucidating its teachings-into English and other modem languages, and to publish the many works in a collection called The Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences. When I recently visited Columbia University, I joked that it would take those currently working at the Institute at least three \"reincarnations\" to complete the task; it surely will require the intelligent and creative efforts of generations of translators from every tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, in the spirit of the scholars of Nalanda, although we may hope that using computers may help complete the work more quickly. As it grows, the Treasury series will serve as an invaluable reference library of the Buddhist Sciences and Arts. This collection of literature has been of immeasurable benefit to us Tibetans over the centuries, so we are very happy to share it with all the people of the world. As someone who has been personally inspired by the works it contains, I firmly believe that the methods for cultivating wisdom and compassion originally developed in India and described in these books preserved in Tibetan translation will be of great benefit to many scholars, philosophers, and scientists, as well as ordinary people. I wish the American Institute of Buddhist Studies at the Columbia Center for Buddhist Studies and Tibet House US every success and pray that this ambitious and far-reaching project to create The Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences will be accomplished according to plan. I also request others, who may be interested, to extend whatever assistance they can, financial or otherwise, to help ensure the success of this historic project.

Homage to Jey Lama, Tsong Khapa Losang Drakpa! Homage to Venerable Geshe Ngawang Wangyal! Homage to Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the Dalai Lama! Since in the case of this work, I am the introducer, translator, as well as the author of the English version of Tsong Khapa' s master work, this Preface will be a bit longer than usual. In 1970-1 971, I spent a year in India with the American Institute of Indian Studies, working on a translation and study of Tsong Khapa' s Essence of True Eloquence, Differentiating the Interpretable and Definitive Meanings of the Buddha's Discourses. During that year I had the privi­lege and pleasure of working closely on the Tibetan edition of that text in frequent meetings with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. I was given excellent instruction in the difficult points and deeper meanings of Buddhist Central Way hermeneutical thought. After his experience instructing a Westerner such as me in those ideas, His Holiness wrote his own book on the topic (with me working on the first draft of the English version), published eventually as The Key to the Middle Way. When I had to leave India, His Holiness charged me to take up the responsibility to see to the translation of the Complete Works of Tsong Khapa and Sons. I most enthusiastically committed myself to under­take the task. I returned to America and received the hearty approval of this project by my root teacher, the Venerable Geshe Ngawang Wangyal. He further urged that, in order for contemporary philosophers and practitioners to appreciate the work of Tsong Khapa and his followers, they would need to have access to the Tengyur, the vast collection of Tibetan translations from the Sanskrit of the thousands of treatises of the great masters of Indian Buddhism. When I wryly said \"Thanks a lot!\" to that huge expansion of the burden, he said, \"Of course, not just xi"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":".rii · .4uthor ·.f Prt'face b�· you rself all alone ... in your lifetime you just set up a system and get it started.·· The next step that led to the present work happened during my completion of the Essence of True Eloquence. I was getting a lot of help from an excellent commentary written by a certain Losang Puntsok (bLo bZang Phun tshogs). While studying that commentary, I came upon a statement by that lama scholar saying that he also was going to write a commentary on Tsong Khapa's Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of the Fi,·e Stages, the Tantric equivalent of the Essence of True Eloquence. It analyzed the five stages of the perfection stage of the Unexcelled Yoga Tantra. focusing on the Esoteric Community noble tradition descending from Nagarjuna. The moment I read that, I formed the resolve to trans­late this Tantric master-treatise of Tsong Khapa 's. In 1978, I applied again to the American Institute of Indian Studies to spend a year in India to study the Unexcelled Yoga Tantras through this text. I thought that, in order to understand this great treatise, I would have to complete the Esoteric Community studies which I had begun long before when I was a Buddhist monk. During that year in India, I began the study and translation of the work, producing also drafts of a number of associated works. Consultations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama on this second big text were extremely rewarding, as to be expected. How­ever, toward the conclusion of that year of studies, I decided not to rush to publish it, due to the esoteric nature of its teachings. His Holiness' senior teacher, the Ganden Throne-holder Kyabjey Lingtsang Rinpochey, transmitter to him (and me) of various Esoteric Community teachings, was strongly opposed to the general publication of such works. Clearly I have not rushed to publish this work, begun thirty years ago. I do so now, since almost all the main practices of Unexcelled Yoga Tantras have been described and published- with varying degrees of clarity and explicitness-though the huge variety and immensely rich and sophisticated detail of their millennial sciences are like an ocean still largely unexplored. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has reasoned that misunderstanding of Tantra already abounds, and so it is desirable and even necessary to be fully transparent about the authentic teachings. Also, in a project to make available the Complete Wo rks of Tsong Khapa and Sons, a large percentage of them do concern the Tantras, so one cannot avoid them.

Further, a deter­mined researcher will find almost anything nowadays. if they look hard enough. Thus, it is my hope, and my intention in publishing this book now, that they should find authentic and accurately clarified information about the amazing \"mental\" or \"inner\" science of the Indian and Tibetan masters, scientists, and yogT/nTs of the Unexcelled Yoga Tantras of Universal Vehicle (Mahayana) Buddhism! In regard to the various sub-series to be included in our Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences list, we are hereby delighted at long last to add another: the Complete Works of Tsang Khapa and Sons, each of which builds upon the Indian works in the Tengyur. As mentioned above. it was planned at the very beginning of the idea for the Tengyur translation project. As it is decades behind schedule, it is a great relief to launch it with this book. The Essence of True Eloquence was my first translation of one of Tsong Khapa's key books. The publication still remains with the Princeton University Press, and they licensed an Indian edition to Motilal Banarsidass publishers in Delhi. Eventually, I hope to improve that work further and bring it back into this series. I have many people to thank. First of all I thank the Tibetan and Mongolian scholar lamas who opened to me the treasury of the Esoteric Community: the late Venerable Geshe Ngawang Wangyal, who read to me the Panchen Rinpochey' s summary of the path and its scope during early morning sessions in 1964; the late His Holiness Kyabjey Lingtsang Rinpochey, who admitted me first into the Community mandala universe; His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who has so generously given of his kind friendship, and transmitted more than I yet know, especially the special tradition of this text at Thegchen Choling in Dharmsala in 1984; the late Venerable Tara Tulku Rinpochey, for his learning, insight, patience and humorous brilliance; the late His Eminence Serkhong Tsenshab Rinpo­chey, for his generosity and kindness; and my friend and cheerful lama, Gelek Rinpochey, for his elegant teachings of the practices.

That is to say, we need to imagine what Tsong Khapa imagines is the kind of being called a \"buddha vajradhara\"-what a buddha really is-whether viewed from the Tantric perspective or not. What he thinks a buddha-being is, is so utterly fantastic, even preposterous, from the perspective of our philo­sophically materialist modem culture, it takes a real effort of imagination, a nearly sci-fi exercise in openness of mind. We don't have to agree that in reality there is such a thing, but to understand the work at hand, it is fruitful to place ourselves in the position of Tsong Khapa's audience. To catch a glimpse of where he is coming from, we have to review the parameters he sets up for our imagining. This is an effort required to understand any form of Buddhism, but it is particularly important in the Tantric or mantric context, since a lot of the work of mantric practice involves contemplative deployment of the structured imagination. It is also quite probable that Tsong Khapa feels he should salute Vajradhara Buddha in this technical way because even his own Tibetan Buddhist contemporaries and successors might not so easily imagine what a buddha is, in its inconceivable reality. Tsong Khapa himself said -after what he referred to as his coming to complete clarity about the uttermost subtleties of the realistic view, and what others refer to as his perfect enlightenment-that it was the opposite of what he had expected it to be, indicating that even a great scholar such as he had not fully been 1 Tib. rGyal ba yan lag bdun ldan. These are the components of a Buddha Vajradhara's material body: 1) it has the auspicious signs and marks; 2) it is in embrace of a wisdom­intuition consort (being both the male and the female); 3) its mind is always super-bliss; 4) such bliss is ever aware of voidness; 5) its compassion avoids extremist calm; 6) its bodily continuum is uninterrupted; and 7) its enlightened deeds are unceasing. 3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4 , lntmd11ction able to imagine what the buddha-uwareness was really like. When even a Buddhist thinks of enlightenment. she thinks of a kind of awareness far greater than her habitual own, but still it is difficult to imagine a be ing whose consciousness is at once infinitely expanded and minutely detailed, who feels him-I her-I it-self a timeless eternity of utter freedom ecstatically blissful. and whose multi-sourced presence can manifest in relation to countless individual beings as countless different relational beings at once. To try to express the inexpressible, from the three buddha-body theory perspective, a buddha is a being who is not restricted to having to be enclosed in a single separate embodiment that faces an \"other\" universe and yet who does not neglect the countless beings who persist in feeling that they are separate, and are facing him, her, or it as an \"other.\" When a buddha completes its, her, or his wisdom store in the buddha-truth-body (Skt. dlumnakiiya), it viscerally experiences itself as indivisibly one with all realities, and other beings and things and the spaces and energies within and around them are felt to be part of its body. This feeling feels those beings, things, and energies as configurations of a limitless bliss, as the truth body is simultaneously a bliss body, the buddha-beatific-body (Skt. sambhogakiiya). This bliss feeling does not anaesthetize the buddha being from also feeling what the beings feel of suffering; in a way the bliss energizes the ability to remain aware of the others' feelings of dis­satisfaction and pain. Indeed, the awareness of others • dissatisfaction and pain in tum stimulates the spacious cloudlike truth-beatitude-indivisible buddha-body to manifest or emanate limitless forms of embodiment (Skt. nirmlif)Qkiiya) as beings or things that can be perceived by the suffering beings and that perfectly mirror to them, according to their perceptual capacities, their potential freedom from suffering and their potential aware­ness of their own natural bliss. Although this description of the inconceivable, amazing cognitive­dissonance-tolerant, dichotomy-reconciling nature of buddhahood is ultimately ungraspable in linear binary terms, we can imagine it with the help of limiting concepts such as voidness, freedom, nonduality, and the elaborated theory of the three bodies of buddhahood. Imagining it, we can aspire consciously to evolve toward achieving it for ourselves and those with whom we want to share it, in case it is really possible and not just a Buddhist fantasy. At any rate, the mantric or Tantric path is pre­sented as the science and art of accelerating such conscious evolution by"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction · 5 employing a supremely subtle technology of spiritual genetic engineering of a buddha mind and buddha bodies. A point that should be clarified here is that the buddha mind is referred to in the theory as a \"body of truth,\" and the buddha bodies of beatitude and emanation are referred to as a \"material body\" (Skt. rapa­kiiya, often wrongly translated as \"form body\"). This may be a hint in the exoteric Universal Vehicle of the esoteric doctrine of the nonduality of body and mind at the ultimate or supremely subtle level. To such an end of stimulating imagination and inspiration, Tsong Khapa embeds in his opening salutatory verse a standard formulation of the seven super-components of the material body of a buddha vajradhara (inconceivably indivisible from his and all buddhas' infinite truth body, itself completely interpenetrating all other embodied beings and discrete things). There are seven super-components of a buddha vajradhara's material body. 1. IT HAS THE AUSPICIOUS SIGNS AND MARKS There are traditionally thirty-two auspicious signs and eighty auspi­cious marks which a buddha vajradhara's material body has in common with other buddhas such as Shakyamuni and so forth. Nagarjuna in his Jewel Rosary details these 112 signs and marks, explaining in brief how each one is the evolutionary (karmic) result of specific deeds in the many lives leading up to buddhahood (see below). The final body of a buddha is the truth or reality body, which is infinite and timeless and indivisible. The individual expands always em­bodied awareness to encompass the ultimate reality of infinite worlds and beings, both enlightened and unenlightened, mental and physical. At the same time, the individual momentum of positive engagement with others -the love and compassion that drives a being to evolve into the ability of providing happiness to countless others-persists in the physical omni­presence of a buddha in an equally infinite beatific body that infinitely enjoys having all reality as its body, and simultaneously encompasses the awarenesses of the infinite others who suffer due to their failure to realize their oneness with such a universe. This awareness automatically and effort­lessly then manifests as infinite seemingly discrete embodiments, called \"emanations.\" For their own evolutionary benefit, self-alienated migrating beings can interact with these emanations. Therefore, a buddha vajradhara"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 · Introduction is not just one individual, beautiful, divine embodiment, separate super­being in a desire realm heaven-that manifestation is just one of countless manifestations, but it is the one that best expresses to the evolutionary psychonaut, or adept, the ideal and goal he or she is aiming for. Regarding the emanation bodies, there are said to be three kinds: artistic, incarnational, and supreme. The artistic emanation body consists of all representations of buddhas and their deeds by artists whose aim is to help beings imagine the supreme evolutionary state all beings can achieve. The incarnational emanation body is all the manifestations a buddha can create to interact with alienated beings in order to help their development, including inanimate objects such as buildings, continents, even planets, in addition to plants and animate beings. The supreme ema­nation body is a buddha like Shakyamuni Buddha, who manifests descent from heaven, conception, birth, and so on (the twelve deeds with which we are familiar). It is such a supreme emanation that manifests a body that carries on it the graphic demonstrations (the signs and marks) of all his or her evolutionary achievements. In this way all emanation bodies are themselves teachings for specific beings in specific evolutionary times and places.

Nagarjuna then goes on to mention the eighty auspicious signs, not listing them, saying it would take too long; but the lists are common in the Sotras. This list gives us the feel of the Buddhist worldview. Life is evolutionary. The acts we perform of body, speech, and mind in any given life produce their result in the future of this life or in a future life. The patterns cited in this specific case of attaining the thirty-two auspi­cious marks of a superbeing (mahapuru�ha) connect moral actions with biological results. A point to be emphasized is that this counts in the Buddhist culture as a \"scientific\" explanation of the physical characteristics of a \"supreme emanation buddha body,\" such as that of Shakyamuni. Therefore, less evolved beings who have so me physical marks resembling these thirty­two have been committing acts of the same type.

Anything in these directions-height and breadth and beauty of body, nature of hands and feet and limbs, shape of eyes. length of tongue, beauty of cheeks, and so on- all these physical traits come from past evolutionary actions of body and speech and mind. The Darwinian theory of \"survival of the fittest\" -meaning increase of the survival-enhancing qualities of a species (not individuals) due to the physical propagation of the offspring of better equipped individuals generation after generation, producing mutations that cope better with the environment, that are transmitted by physical genes, and so forth- is somewhat parallel to the Buddhist theory. But added here to that picture (of the mutations of species over countless generations in coordination with environmental changes) is the individual's own personal evolution. That individual carries the results of his or her own evolutionary actions encoded in a mental gene (Skt. gotra) that goes from one coarse flesh and blood em­bodiment to another, meeting the physical genes of fathers and mothers in human or other animal forms born in mammalian womb, reptilian or avian egg, insect moisture, or magical environment. Once persons encounter such a \"karmic\" biological worldview and come to think of it as realistic, either through cultural conditioning in a Buddhist culture or through historical and internal scientific investiga­tion, they adapt their lifestyles to consciously cultivate that mental gene through skillful evolutionary actions, considering that cultivation to be the prime priority of their lives, since its results will determine the quali­ties of their inevitable lives far into the future. The ultimate change of lifestyle is precisely the Tantric one, where individuals decide that they cannot wait for countless rebirths of gradual progress to reach the summit of positive life experience for self and other that is defined as buddhahood. And so they enter the Tantric path of self creation and self perfection, compressing all those deaths and rebirths into a single intense lifetime or a few lifetimes in order to get to the highest goal as soon as possible. Tantric art and contemplative technology is thus a form of genetic engineering. The main tool is the highly concentrated and stabilized crea­tive imagination, which uses the patterns of the mandala environments and the divine embodiments (themselves derived from meritorious actions and scientific insights) to shape the spiritual gene of the practitioner. This shaped gene then simulates, in the virtual reality of the lucid-dream-like"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10 ·Introduction 1.'\"0ntemplative performance (Skt. slldhana). the death, between, and rebirth processes; first as a rehearsal of out-of-coarse-or subtle- body perform­ances; and then as actual mind-and shape-shifting transformations in the evolutionary direction of buddhahood. 2. IT IS IN EMBRACE OF A WISDOM-INTUITION CONSORT (AS BOTH THE MALE AND THE FEMALE) The highest pleasure in ordinary life is generally conceded to be the release experienced in sexual orgasm, wherein an individual melts his or her normal bodily rigidities and feels intense rapture through a blissful inner flooding of pleasurable energy. In Buddhist neuro-biology, this is explained as the bodily energies (or vital winds) dissolving away from their normal functions in the limbs and muscles and nerves (including the brain) and concentrating in the central channel of the nervous system, said to run through the body from mid-brow up to crown of head and down in front of the spine to the tip of the genital organ. These energies take with them endocrine drops that anchor blissful feelings and concentrate them into a powerful force that carries the mind with it into release from all mental and physical preoccupations. The most powerful bliss experience of this kind occurs in a \"normal,\" egocentrically-wired being only at death, as the mental energy is released from preoccupation within the coarse body. That experience dissipates as that mental-subtle-energy continuum arises as a subtle dreamlike body in a \"between state.\" This fairy-like \"between being\" (Skt. gandharva) migrates in its state of separateness throughout all the optional forms of existence in the vast universe other than it. When eventually the gandharva being itself is attracted to the coupling of a male and a female of some species, it melts into their state of self-expanding passion and is drawn into its next coarse embodiment in a womb, etc. Therefore, that a vajradhara buddha is always in embrace with a wisdom-intuition consort indicates that this embodiment is not a coarse, non-blissful, ordinary one. It is perpetually indivisible from the bliss of orgasmic freedom, experiencing the male and female complementarity of orgasmic wholeness and contentment at all times. This gives a hint that such a being is nothing but a manifestation of the infinite bliss-void­indivisible of the infinite truth and beatific bodies, where every atom and subatomic energy is experienced as orgasmic release in creative magical emanation."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction · 11 A very key point to note here - to clear up a general scholarly mis­apprehension about Tantra, namely that it is essentially a male chauvinist tradition- is that a vajradhara buddha is both the female and the male in the embrace, not just the male exploitively wrapping himself in some sort of subservient female as a mindless accessory. On simpler levels, the male is universal compassion and the female transcendent wisdom; the male is superbliss art and the female is profound voidness wisdom; or the male is the magic illusion body and the female the clear light transparence of the total voidness. 3. ITS MIND IS ALWAYS SUPER-BLISS This emphasizes the transcendent nature of buddhahood: a vajra­dhara buddha bodymind represents the ultimate nondual awareness of en­lightenment that experiences its own/everything's reality as unobstructed bliss of orgasmic freedom, nirvana. This is the reality that Shakyamuni and all buddhas proclaim as the very substance of even samsaric reality, not enjoyed by beings who misknow it as otherwise, even while their bodies and minds are essentially constituted of bliss and their whole beings are primally interpenetrated by uncreated nirvana. In exoteric Universal Vehicle this is taught by the Buddha in the Lotus Satra and other cata­phatic SUtras, wherein the Buddha shocks his dualistic Elder disciples, monastic vehicle arhat saints, by proclaiming the world's purity, blissful­ness, eternal selfhood, and transcendent freedom. 4. SUCH BLISS IS EVER AWARE OF VOIDNESS This blissful wisdom that enjoys the inconceivable exquisiteness of the relative world never loses sight of its essential freedom, its ultimate peacefulness, its brilliant infinite energy that therefore has no need to do anything, and so has done all that needs to be done. So the nirvanic bliss­awareness is not contradictory to the ultimate calmness and oneness of the immanent beyond; it neither troubles the ocean of bliss with elabora­tions nor constrains it by clinging to non-elaboration. Being \"aware of voidness\" simply means that the blissed-out subjectivity remains in a limitlessly melting, nongrasping flow, in unity with an infinite horizon of openness pervading all objectivities."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"12 · Introduction 5. ITS COMPASSION AVOIDS EXTREMIST CALM The previous two super-components of a vajr adhara indicate the buddha mind's nature as the ultimate tolerance of cognitive dissonance, the reconciliation of all dichotomies, the unity of simplicity and complexity, and not simply as a collapsed state of total extinct oblivion or resigned relational bondage. Particularly, this fifth super-component indicates that a vajradhara buddha is not tempted to escape into sheer infinity without any differentiated objects; his/her/its transcendent wisdom is absolutely self-transforming into the infinite compassion that cannot abandon beings trapped by ignorance in the suffering of egocentric separateness and aliena­tion from the multi-dimensional, inconceivable universe of freedom. 6. ITS BODILY CONTINUUM IS UNINTERRUPTED Being an infinite awareness beyond unity and plurality, one indi­visible-with every detail- with all buddhas of the past, present, and future, along with all unenlightened beings of all those three times also, and being also indivisible with the infinite clear light transparency energy of absolute void freedom, a vajradhara buddha effortlessly responds to the needs of infinite numbers of suffering beings. A vajradhara buddha manifests from this inexhaustibly energetic nirvanic reality whatever medi­cine will relieve that suffering, whether it be the magical emanation of a vajradhara, a buddha, a bodhisattva, a person, a companion, an enemy, a substance, a continent, a planet, a star, a deity, a demon, a death, a rebirth, and so forth. The fact that some sensitive humans who seek freedom and enlight­enment carry subconsciously the notion that they are somehow going to escape from embodiment, going to have a rest, going to get out of entan­glements, and so forth, is nowhere more powerfully responded to in the Buddhist Sntras than by the iconic event of the supreme emanation body Buddha's parinirvana, ultimate freedom understood by dualistic Buddhists as \"no more rebirth.\" However, the proposition that a buddha simply dis­appears from existence upon final enlightenment is definitively refuted by the many Universal Vehicle presentations of nonduality. 7.

Iconically, this presents buddhahood not as the permanent extinction attractive to escapist dualists, but rather as a glorious explosion into infinite life, driven by in­finite compassion into hyperdrive to manifest whatever is needed to tame whomsoever. This last super-component of vajradharahood adds to the Tantric dimension an encouraging transhistorical dimension where the aspirant need no longer feel lost in a decadent historical era when buddhas are gone, enlightened institutions have been crushed, beings are deluded and self-destructive, and so on-just how the world looks to us when we read the news or get bogged down in confronting political confusion, venality, and incompetence.

This scientist­explorer can always and without fail discover the past present and future vajradhara buddhas to help her or him find knowledge, consecration, instruction, wisdom, and artfulness. As far away as they may seem at times, their enlightened deeds are unceasing, they are never retired or unavailable. I am fully aware that this unpacking of Tsong Khapa' s opening salutation reveals a worldview profoundly at odds with that of \"modern\" scientific materialism. I do not expect academic colleagues-committed to the institutions founded on spiritual absolutism and now devoted to scientific materialism-to be convinced that such things can be realistic: such things as real former and future life continua, mental genetic evolu­tion, a teleology not based on an omnipotent creator god but on individ­ual choice of purpose made by rational persons who scientifically investi­gate reality in systematic ways and discover the void nature of things as being in nondual harmonious equivalence with a causal coherence of lifestyle leading to buddhahood as the logical summit of evolutionary potential.

For had they gone, they might not have returned very easily, if at all in that era, and Tibet would not have benefited from the twenty years of writing. teach­ing, and building Tsong Khapa gave to it from that time until his passing in 1419. And what are these \"secrets\" of which Vajradhara/VajrapaQi is the \"Lord?\" These are the esoteric teachings of the Tantras, which are the \"continua\" of person, re ality, and teaching, that are the highest technolo­gies of transforming the meaningless, purposeless, and miserable world of cyclic living-wherein misknowing egocentric beings struggle futilely and endlessly against an overwhelming infinite universe-into a buddha­verse of mutual love, compassion, and blissful pleasure energizing the inconceivable positive evolution of interconnected self and other. Why are they \"secret?\" They are not secret from anyone who needs them, just as the formulas and procedures of sub-atomic quantum physics are not intrinsically secret from anyone, but are as good as secret for any­one who is unprepared by a complex and sustained education. For such persons, they are incomprehensible and useless. Moreover, there is an additional element in the need for secrecy in the context of Tantra; the need to protect such unprepared persons, as they can hurt themselves in profound evolutionary ways if they misuse the powerful technologies of Tantra. A cardinal Tantric technique is the art of purifying perception: to visualize and gradually learn to perceive the universe as a buddhaverse or mandalic paradise, with all beings as divine \"buddhine\" beings and all environments as perfected divine abodes. If this were to be employed with sustained concentration by persons who have not first had some level of experiential realization of voidness and its inevitably entailed aware­ness of the relativity and constructedness of all things, it would lead such practitioners into the trap of psychosis, getting them stuck in an alternate reality far more pleasant and seemingly secure than the jarring and dangerous ordinary reality. A second cardinal art of Tantra is purifying self-conception: cultivating a divine buddha-identity to replace the ordi­nary, habitual self-identity of the ignorant person. If that were to be practiced by someone without at least some level of the realization of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"16 · Introduction selflessness and its entailed insight into the constructedness of relational self. it would lead to megalomania. Thirdly, if a practitioner does not have at least some degree of detachment from primal subconscious drives of eros and thanatos. and some degree of universal compassion toward others. the powerful energies of the deeper mind and body, when aroused within the Tantric atmosphere, are likely to carry the person still perceiv­ing those energies as lust and hostility into dangerous areas of manipulat­ive exploitation of others, which would prove enormously destructive to both self and others. Therefore the guardian of the secrets of the Tantras is the fierce Vajrapag.i, who appears occasionally in the exoteric Sotras as a yak�ha­like fierce protector of the Buddha, who dwells under his teaching throne. I recall the Surra of the Wise and the Fool account where several Vajra­pag.is come out from under Shakyamuni's throne to ward off the six false teachers. ANCESTRAL MENTORS This term \"ancestral mentor\" (Tib. brgyud pa 'i bla rna), usually translated \"lineage lama,\" is translated this way to reveal the feeling of a practicing great adept, who is not identified in her or his mind with his blood lineage and does not look back to great grandparents and so on as the most important ancestors. We can see in the case of Tibetan culture that the common institution of ancestor worship or preoccupation with bone (father) and blood (mother) lineage is almost completely neglected, having been thoroughly eroded by the commonsensically accepted, cul­turally embedded, biological theory of karmic evolution. That is, persons so acculturated consider their own past existences to have been in other families, nations, genders, races, even species, and so there is not a very strong connection with the blood or bone of the parents of this life and their forebears. Further, a dead parent or great grandparent is considered more likely to be reincarnated as one's neighbor than to be in some ances­tral happy hunting ground awaiting veneration and the offerings of tea and cookies from successive generations. However, in past generations, those who provided and preserved precious Dharma teachings and practices are the spiritual ancestors who engendered the good qualities and liberating realizations in oneself that really enhance one's \"spiritual gene\" (gotra, rigs); so they are considered the real ancestors. Spiritual adepts-and, by their conscious and subliminal"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction · 17 example. all Tibetans-are acculturated to view their Dharma ancestors as more important than their clan forebears. The rituals of offering drops of elixir to them in one's daily prayers and performances are in effect substitutes for the more usual ancestor rituals we find in other Asian societies. Every ritual performance (sadhana) written by lamas such as Tsong Khapa and his successors. and performed by hundreds of thousands of monks and nuns over the centuries, includes an invocation of these ancestral mentors at the beginning and makes offerings to them during a later section of the performance. THE PATH OF THE ESOTERIC COMMUNITY TANTRA From among the Unexcelled Yoga Tantras, the Esoteric Commu­nity Ta ntra (Guhyasamaja) is considered by Tsong Khapa the paradig­matic \"Father Tantra.\" I say \"paradigmatic\" rather than \"supreme,\" as is often said, since every Tantra proclaims itself to be \"supreme.\" Indeed, each of them can assist the practitioner to the supreme achievement of buddhahood if properly implemented. The special virtue of the Esoteric Community is said to be that it has five Explanatory Ta ntras taught by Vajradhara Buddha which complement the originally revealed Root Ta ntra. It therefore provides all the materials needed for a student and practitioner to understand all Tantras, many of which are less complete in their teachings. The \"Father\" category of Tantras is critically defined by Tsong Khapa as characterizing those Tantras that emphasize the methodology for attaining the magic body (mayadeha, sgyu Ius), a subtle body like a dream body. The practitioner learns to release this subtle body from within his or her meditatively entranced coarse body, which subtle body can then act in the universe to accelerate the accumulation of the stores of merit and wisdom that are required for buddhahood, gathering lifetimes of merit and wisdom in a single lifetime dedicated to such meditation. The \"Mother\" category of Unexcelled Yoga Tantras emphasizes the arts of deepening the wisdom of either a coarsely or a subtly embodied practitioner by plunging her or him again and again into the clear light transparence realms within the infinite event horizon of deep voidness. With all due respect, Tsong Khapa critiqued those venerated mentor scholars, such as Buton Rinpochey, who argued for a third category of \"nondual\" Unexcelled Yoga Tantras, on the principle that all of them are nondual; the \"Mother\" and \"Father\" categories simply describe their"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"18 · Introduction dominant emphasis, not an exclusive focus. These most advanced Tantras are all called \"unexcelled\" (anuttara), rather than \"highest\" (parama), because they reveal and make accessible the innermost core of nondual reality, and nothing can go beyond them since they contain everything within their matrix; \"highest\" implies a hierarchy in which the goal is somehow above and away from the \"lower\" things, which would carry a trace of dualism. Unexcelled Yoga Tantra teaching is not \"higher\" than the four noble truths, the eightfold path, the ten transcendences, and so forth. It is the matrix in which all of those teachings are nested, and where they are fulfilled to the subtlest and most complete degree. Although Tsong Khapa was an adept practitioner of a number of Tantras other than the Esoteric Community-he quotes from many of them-he usually based his analytic commentaries such as this one on the Esoteric Community literature and its commentaries developed in the noble (Skt. arya) tradition of Indian Buddhist Tantrism. Tsong Khapa goes on to mention outstanding examples of the spiri­tual ancestors he reveres as having brought the Esoteric Community Ta ntra teaching forward in history from the initial revelation of the Buddha to Tsong Khapa's day. INDRABHOTI Indrabhiiti was a great adept said to have been a high king of U<;l<;li­yana. Contemporary scholars identify this land with the Swat valley pres­ently in Pakistan, but in ancient times it possibly represented the entire country now known as Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It is said that he was fortunate enough to have received the original revelation of the Eso­teric Community Ta ntra directly from Shakyamuni as Vajradhara. It is said that the reason the Esoteric Community mandala universe has no charnel grounds (shmashana) around it (representing samsaric existence), as do other Unexcelled Yoga Tantras, is that since lndrabhoti was a king, he liked things clean and orderly. He would have been repelled by any graphic display of the decay and putrefaction elemental in ordinary life. Upon re­ceiving the teachings, Indrabhoti put them into practice and within twelve years attained perfect buddhahood as a great adept. He spread the teach­ing so widely within his kingdom, it is said, that even the fish in the lakes attained communion (yuganaddha), the orgasmic embrace of personal one­ness with all nature and all beings that describes Tantric buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"lmroduction · 19 NAGAOAKINI It is interesting that the second ancestor is a female. the Dragon Angel (klu'i mkha 'gro ma), who figures in the tradition's history as hav­ing received the Esoteric Community Ta ntra teachings and precepts from King lndrabhOti and passed them on in turn to the southern Indian king, Visukalpa.

ARYADEVA Aryadeva was born as the son of the king of Shri Lanka in ca. 3rd century CE. miraculously appearing in a lotus in the garden. According to his legend, like Nagarjuna, he lived for several centuries. Although placed on the throne at an early age, he felt dissatisfied with royal life and soon renounced his role in society and wandered off into South India to study the Dharma, taking ordination from Nagarjuna himself. He soon became the Master's foremost disciple, even surpassing his Master in some re­spects, as conveyed in the legends of his Tantric persona, Kal\"(laripa. This is only startling if we fail to recognize the basic anti-authoritarian and progressive stance of Buddhism, even in those ancient times.

Aryadeva, like Nagarjuna, is claimed as a patriarch by the Ch'an/ Zen school of the Far East. Aryadeva's principal philosophical works show that he did indeed take on the various Brahmin schools of thought, whereas Nagarjuna had mainly confined himself to refuting the Individual Vehicle Abhidharma masters who had fallen into too rigid a spiritualistic dualism to open up to the profound teaching of wisdom and compassion indivisible. Aryadeva's greatest work of critical philosophy was the Four Hun­dred on Y oga Practice, which begins with a systematic arrangement of the Universal Vehicle path, and continues with a devastating critique of all the extremist ideologies existent in India during his time. His major work in the Tantric field, the Lamp of Integrated Practices, is remarkable for its lucidity and comprehensiveness. It is very extensively quoted by Tsong Khapa in the present work, which some consider as much a commentary on Aryadeva's Lamp as an independent treatise. What is specially inter­esting about it is its attempt to integrate exoteric and esoteric Universal Vehicle practices, even though its main focus is the perfection stages prac­tices of the noble tradition. NAGABODHI, SHAKYAMITRA, MATANGIPA These three important disciples of Nagarjuna were key figures in the noble tradition of the Community. Nagabodhi wrote a number of im­portant works, Shakyamitra a chapter of the Five Stages as Nagarjuna's transmitter, and Matangipa various works in the Tengyur collection. CHANDRA[KIRTI]PADA Chandrakirti was also from South India, born probably in the latter part of the 6th century CE in a place called Samanta, according to Tibetan sources. He was ordained and studied under Buddhapalita's disciple Kamalabuddhi. After becoming an expert himself, he went to Nalanda in the north, and eventually became an abbot there. At the time, the ruling post-Gupta monarch was somewhat unfavorable to the Buddhist scholars, so they were restricting their teaching activities to the monastic univer­sity proper. Chandrakirti changed that, and began to teach the Universal Vehicle and the Centrist philosophy widely again. He had a famous debate that lasted for seven years with the master grammarian and ideal­ist philosopher, Chandragomin.

At the end of his long life , Nagarjuna taught him his \"ultimate\" teaching, that of the uncreated. Whatever else this may mean. it indicates a sense of Chandrakirti's destiny as elucidator of the essence of Nagarjuna's message, as does the legendary connection with Maiijushri. Other legendary events of his life are his milking of the picture of a cow to feed the monks of Nalanda during a famine, and his riding of a stone lion to frighten away a Tajik army that was threatening the monastery. He is also said to have survived a forest fire while meditat­ing in retreat. His rescuers found him in the middle of an unburnt circle on his grass mat, saying, \"My master Nagarjuna burnt entirely the fuel of phenomena with the fire of the uncreated. My master has done so, and I have done so; so how can the phenomenal fire burn me?\" Many other such miraculous signs are recounted. A final interesting story about him was his last interaction with Avalokiteshvara, after he discovered that the bodhisattva had been help­ing his adversary Chandragomin in their debate. Avalokiteshvara said that he was always there to help everyone, but that people couldn't see him. Chandra carried him around town on his head, but most people saw nothing, some saw a dead dog, and one prostitute saw a foot of the Lord Avalokiteshvara, whereby she instantly attained numerous siddhi powers. It is highly interesting that a story so similar to the legend of Asailga should be attached to this paragon of the deep wisdom lineage. Chandrakirti's greatest works were his Stages of the Enlightenment Path work, Introduction to the Middle Way, his commentary on Nagar­juna's Wisdom, the Lucid Exposition, and his commentary on the Esoteric Community Ta ntra, the Illumination of the Lamp. These latter two are known as the sun and moon, lighting up the earth of Sutra and Tantra, respectively. Finally, the Tibetans consider him also to be one of the \"Eighty-four Great Adepts.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Introduction · 23 ABOUT THESE LEGENDARY ACCOUNTS The attitude and hardened opinion among modem Buddhist studies scholars is that the Indian and Tibetan Buddhist scholars (and perhaps some members of the Shingon Buddhist tradition of Japan) could not manage to notice the difference between Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, and Chandrakirti-the philosopher sages of early and middle first millennium Buddhism-and the adepts by the same names listed here in the ancestral lineage of the Esoteric Community Ta ntra teachings. This disrespectful opinion about the naivete, or fundamentalism, or whatever else, on the part of the many great intellects to whom it is applied will simply no longer do. It goes along with the long-established, and now perhaps sub­liminal, \"Westerners'\" chauvinist idea and racial prejudice that \"Eastern\" people are to be lumped together with \"primitive\" people (not to mention that the so-called \"primitives\" don't fit the caricature either). The idea is that since \"Eastern\" people have no sense of linear time, no interest in history, and so live in the eternal now of endless cycles, this explains their lack of progress in the sciences and their general social backwar dness and economic underdevelopment. Therefore, quite naturally, modem scholars would think that such \"backward\" people would be so unrealistic, unsci­entific, and unhistorical as to think that the two Nagarjunas, Aryadevas, and Chandrakirtis could be the same persons. And they think the same about the many other Indian master authors who also wrote both philoso­phical and exoteric works of solid repute as well as works on the esoteric Tantras (actually most of the great ones did). The evidence for this truism of contemporary scholars is exclusively the presumed existence and nonexistence of texts. There is absolutely no \"hard\" evidence at all. The only dating used by modem scholars for these individuals comes from the recorded timing of Chinese or Tibetan transla­tions of texts attributed to them, built upon by a certain amount of inter­textual referencing. Texts in India were hand-written on palm leaf pages and never printed until recent times. They would not last too long and would be re-copied over and over, usually every few generations. Root texts and commentaries were often intermingled, so intertextual reference is sometimes an unreliable guide. Spiritual texts in particular were con­sidered more importantly memorized than written, a tradition that came from Vedic practices. Additionally, esoteric texts were kept strictly secret, if committed at all to some handwritten pages. The tradition says that the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24 · Introduction Tantric traditions were kept hidden without being written down in the human realm for over 700 years. This is the place to put this contentious issue into a new light (as I will do more in detail below), in the context of this work on the perfection stage of Unexcelled Yoga Tantra, considered by the Indo-Tibetan Univer­sal Vehicle Buddhists to be the most advanced possible scientific and spiritual teaching. Since there is no hard evidence either way as to the dating, life-spans, and historical activities of these eminent personalities, it is more respectful and logical to accept the critical scholarship of the traditional analysts than it is to presume to know better and dogmatically follow our various modern, \"Western,\" and \"scientific\" prejudices. The basic presumption is that, since there are no such (we are cer­tainly not) extraordinary, miracle-producing, highly enlightened beings with far-beyond-though-not-dissimilar-to-Einstein genius, no one ever could have been such a person, especially not a \"pre-modern,\" Asian, spiritual person. Indeed the very concept of the enlightenment of buddha­hood as the complete and accurate knowledge of the exact nature of reality is preposterous to us on its face. However, we must here confront the fact that the only evidence we have for the rigid opinion that there are no other extraordinary persons up to the inconceivably extraordinary person of a buddha is our own failure to be enlightened in that way. We cannot even say we have the evidence of never having met any such person, since they have the tradition of most often hiding their enlightenment, perhaps to avoid arrest, intrusive dissection, and lethal examination such as the E.T. in the film was about to undergo when he escaped. So we might have met one or two, but were unfortunately unable to recognize them. I do not say I am so enlightened, or that I know I have met any who are, but I am open to the fact that I wouldn't have recognized one if I saw her or him. So at least I maintain an open mind. To summarize this argument so far: 1) The presence or absence of texts in the climate of India cannot provide ironclad dating evidence. All the claims of contemporary scholars that there must be two of everybody are just speculation grounded in pre­conceived ideas. 2) The Tibetan scholars who accept that the two Nagarjunas, two Aryadevas, etc., are the same persons in diffe rent eras and contexts is a perfectly good hypothesis until something non-speculative arises to dis-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introduction · 25 prove it. A \"modernist\" presumption of superior perspective is no better than a racist, nationalist, religious, or culturalist one. 3) The whole program of disproving everything \"traditional\" people think and believe, based on the assumed superiority of our modernist knowledge and culture, is itself obsolete in the postmodern era. A key part of our critical scholarship's quest of objective truth has to be to question the rigidity of our conditioned subjectivities and their biases and blindnesses. Through global warming (over-heating), pollution, popula­tion explosion, etc., we are driving the world into extinction with our diseased, ignorance-driven, objectivist science and technology-magnified egocentrist culture. This cannot rationally be considered superiority in knowledge and culture. It will not do to proclaim like the late Richard Rorty that we are ethnocentric, and then just honor that fact by refusing to learn anything about any other culture or look at the world through other eyes and languages and worldviews. 4) The essence of the noble tradition of the Esoteric Community and other Unexcelled Yoga Tantras, as opposed to the Jiianapada tradi­tion and perhaps others, is that the dialecticist centrist worldview goes along with the Unexcelled Yoga lifestyle. It is inner scientific and techno­logical and not merely nonrational and mystical. Tsong Khapa bows with powerful faith not because he is a funda­mentalist- not at all-but because he has met these ancestral adepts personally, he has talked with them. They are immortal on the magic body (miiyadeha) plane, like George Lucas's jedi masters, who can walk back and forth through time. So therefore, we need not be over-obsessed with ancillary issues of historicism. My only purpose in even bringing it up myself-in the face of the sharp teeth of all my colleagues' and even students' modernist presuppositions- is only as part of helping the reader break through for a moment their habitual intellectual and even uncon­scious entrapment in a horizon of preconceptions wherein everything explored in this work of Tsong Khapa and other Tibetan master scholar­adepts is some sort of quaint pseudo-magical thinking, primitive supersti­tious twaddle, perhaps of some interest historically that people were ever so crazy. This means that Tsong Khapa himself, if he were engaged with us, would be delighted if someone were to find a brass plate engraved with a note from Vajrin Nagarjuna that he is not the Acharya Nagarjuna, but his"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"26 · Introduction successor in philosophy and institution, his reincarnation, his namesake, his inspired descendant, or whatever. Once in a taped interview, the present Dalai Lama of Tibet, himself a scholar and adept of this type (though he would certainly disclaim the latter honorific), once was asked the following hypothetical question by the late Carl Sagan: \"Your Holiness, what would you do if we set up a careful experiment and conclusively disproved the possibility of personal reincarnation?\" After a moment of thought, the Dalai Lama said, \"Why I would cease to believe in it! We no longer consider the earth to be a flat continent projecting outward from an axial mountain.\" Sagan caught his breath from the surprise and cognitive dissonance he was experiencing from this response. After another moment, the Dalai Lama asked enthusi­astically, \"Now how would we go about setting up such an experiment?\" Needless to say, Sagan was speechless, and looked quite re lieved as both broke into hearty laughter. So we should certainly continue to look for evidence to support, refine, or disprove the current set of scholarly historicist theories about the dating and meaning of the Buddhist Tantras. But until we do find some­thing as concrete as the brass plaque disclaimer by Vajrin Nagarjuna, we should not avoid looking into the Tantras on the terms of those who looked into them before, over centuries, scholastically as well as yogically. These masters were highly intelligent, rational, scientific-minded people. After much study and practice they came to accept the human possibility of the full enlightenment of body as well as mind via the esoteric evolu­tionary acceleration that uses a virtual reality subtle bodymind to develop the three bodies of buddhahood in one lifetime or two. Therefore, whether or not they had attained such a fulfillment personally, they came to accept as scientific fact that their great adept ancestors had broken the biological imperatives of our era's maximum hundred year lifespan and could have continued their studies und teachings over centuries. Even after physical death. such spiritual ancestors could appear concretely and enduringly to disciples of later times who required their direct instruction.

I need not elaborate the history of Tsong Khapa' s special devotion to and mentor relationship with Maii.jushri, which I have already done in detail in my Central Philosophy of Tibet. Suffice it to say that, as hard­headed a logician and critical philosopher as he was, he did experience himself as in direct dialogue with the divine bodhisattva, day in and day out, discussing where to go, what to do, how to develop insight into the nature of reality, and how to practice accordingly. That is to say, his pri­mary mentor in exoteric Centrist philosophical studies, and simultane­ously his root guru in the esoteric practice sense, was thought by him to be the divine bodhisattva himself-in short, his main teacher was what might be called an angelic being. What is interesting here is that the salutation to the bodhisattva of wisdom in this context indicates the Tibetan tradition that the study of Dialecticist Centrism and Unexcelled Yoga Tantra are two sides of the same coin. That is, the philosophical view of Tantrism is Dialecticist relativism-the view that all things are purely conventional, illusory, and dream-like in their reality. Therefore, their nature and structure are power­fully controlled by language, relatively ultimately in the form of mantra.

This fu ll entanglement of Siltra and Tantra is further indicated by Tsong Khapa's statement above that it is through mastery of the Esoteric Community Unexcelled Yoga Tantra that one attains the enlightenment that bestows full explanatory eloquence about the exoteric Sotra teachings. Why does he refer to the goal of enlightenment as \"supreme eloquence\" about Buddha's Sotras? It must be because the first thing an enlightened being feels like doing is to share her or his happiness by expressing it in ways that will be effective in enlightening others.

Still, there are those whose studies and practice of the subtleties of logic, ethics, and critical philosophy have not prepared them to enter the Tantric path. There needs to be a basis of at least a solid inferential understanding of voidness, a firm vow of the spirit of enlightenment, and a degree of tran­scendence of being dominated by instinctual drives for power and fame. Students not properly prepared tend to take some simplistic version of initiation or teaching and think \"Ah, I am perfect! I have the perfect teaching! My teacher gave me the inner secret precept !

But according to that, the definitive position is that Un­excelled art and wisdom Tantras are both ultimately nondual Tantras. Hence they must say how their own position, that the Unexcelled Tantras 14al have three kinds-which are differentiated by the criterion of whether they teach the two separately or both together-is not contradictory to that.

[I.B.2.b.j.A'-Thl' Ltctual ml'aning) It appears that these scholars who divide the Unexcelled Tantras into three separate types of Tantras l.!'ul make the basic mistake of considering the \"art\" and \"wisdom\" of \"art. wisdom, nondual Tantra\" and the \"art\" and \"wisdom\" of \"distinct art and wisdom Tantras,\" as being objectively the same, [due to their) having the same names. Therefore, they think that \"integrated wisdom and art Tantra\" and \"distinct wisdom [Tantra]\" and \"[distinct) art Tantra,\" using the same \"wisdom\" and \"art\" terms, must be contradictory. Therefore, one must distinguish the two [meanings of \"art\" and \"wisdom\"]. With regard to the \"yoga\" involved in both Yogi and Yoginl Unex­celled Tantras, the \"art\" of the non-partial, equally integrated \"art and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter /-Introduction · 41 wisdom nondual\" Tantra refers to the spontaneous great bliss, and the \"wisdom\" is the famous frequently-mentioned genius that realizes the suchness of selfless voidness. All Unexcelled Tantras are the same in terms of their indivisible union of actual art and wisdom as such bliss and voidness, in taking this as their supreme subject of concern, and thus the condition of the nature of all Unexcelled Tantras is that they are actual nondual Tantras. Therefore, in terms of such kinds of art and wisdom, none are established as partial to either. Thus the Father Tantras and the Mother Tantras are said to be divisions of the basic [category of] nondual Tantras, and are not to be understood as exclusive categories. Thus, the Stainless Light states that really, all are just Yoga Tantras [Sbl of the nature of art and wisdom. Likewise, the Hevajra states: The \"HEY'' syllable is great compassion, The \"VAJRA\" is called \"wisdom.\" Listen, and I will explain That Tantra whose nature is art and wisdom! And so, [according to others' systems,] the Hevajra would not be not a \"wisdom Tantra,\" because it does not say, \"Listen to this 'wisdom Tantra! \"' Likewise, the Community states: The union of art and wisdom Is declared to be \"yoga.\" The Community is declared to be \"yoga,\" The means of expression of all buddhas! And so the Community would not be an art Tantra. Likewise, the Prime Buddha [Time Machine Ta ntra] declares: Yoga is not by the body of art, Nor will it be by wisdom alone. The Transcendent Lord declared that \"yoga\" Is the union of art and wisdom. The Vajra Essence Commentary [on Hevajraj4 also explains it in that way. 4 rdo rj e snying po'i 'grel pa.

In our own system, it does not amount to asserting that those two are not Father Tantra and Mother Tantra [respectively]. These two are mentioned as especially famous examples of Father and Mother Tantras, which is not to say that other Tantras are not either art Tantras or wisdom Tantras. [1.8.2.b.i.B'-Dispelling objections] One should not succumb to the notion that, based on the fact that the Yogini Tantras such as Hevajra often mention \"bliss\" l6aJ and the Community does not use the word \"bliss\" often- usually explaining in terms of the four voids- that great bliss is distinctive of the Mother Tantras and the Father Tantras do not employ the actual path of great bliss. The Great Adept Kr�hQacharya explained [in the Clarification of the Esoteric Reality]: The statements \"Thus [have I heard ... ]\" [Expressing the bliss-void setting] of the Yoga Tantras, Are like fire to the straw of other [beginnings], [Often used] in the Mother Tantras; But this is not an essential distinction, According to the Mind-Vajra. Thus, the indivisible union of [great] bliss and voidness that is explained to be the actual meaning of the initial expression, \"Thus have I [heard] ... \" that is used in the art Tantras is also the [essential] import of the Yogini Tantras. Therefore, he explains that the Victor declared there is no distinc­tion between the two Tantras concerning their essence, which is the union of bliss and void. Particularly, in regard to determining the meaning of the beginning, \"Thus have I heard ... \" of the Community, [Mahasukhanatha5] explains more than once in the Esoteric Accomplishment that the reality praised as, \"where present, [enlightenment is] present: where absent, absent,\" is the indissoluble union of great bliss and voidness: 5 Apparently an honorific pseudonym of the adept Padmavajra.

Thus, this demonstration that there is no difference among all the Unexcelled Tantras in taking the actuality of the path as the real indi­visible union of the art of bliss and the wisdom of voidness requires that, whatever path of the two kinds of [Unexcelled] Tantra one enters-the generation within one's own process of the indissoluble union of bliss"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44 · Brilliant Illumination of the lAmp and void, art and wisdom-be understood as indispensable.

[I.B.2.b.ii.A'-Explanation from such (tex ts) as the Stainless Light] If the \"art\" and \"wisdom\" of \"art, wisdom, nondual\" Tantras are as explained above, then what are the \"art\" and \"wisdom\" mentioned in Tantras of separate \"art\" and \"wisdom?\" The way of establishing them is somewhat explained in the Stain-less Light, stating: In regard to certain Tantras, using such mundane superfi­cial distinctions as the mirror-intuition to symbolically purify6 the aggregates and elements, the Transcendent Lord stated [classifications such as] art and wisdom, to accord with the inclinations of less intelligent living beings. Thus, separate \"art\" and \"wisdom\" Tantras were set up according to male deities established as art from the symbolically purified aggregates and female deities established as wisdom from the purified elements.

And when the art engages in action and the wisdom does not move, it is an art Tantra. When the deity functions- as in compelling the wisdom hero [to merge] into the devotee hero and so on- and the goddesses act !7bl and the gods do not, it is a wisdom Tantra; when the reverse is the case, it is an art Tantra. So states [the Stainless Light], and the Vajra Essence Commentary {on Hevajra] also explains in similar fashion. Here you may object that if, according to this the Time Machine itself must be accepted as an art Tantra, does that not contradict the Stainless Light's statement that \"by the distinction of three years, it is definitely a Yogini Tantra\"? [This] explains it to be a Yogini Tantra in the context of showing the number of the deities of the Yogini Tantra by means of the [number of the] days of the central [channel] of three years.7 The way of establishing the two Tantras through male and female deities is intended as a matter for changing emphasis and not as a fixed [classification]. For example, the Esoteric Community in the noble system is an art Tantra, and yet the [creation stage] summoning and inducting of the wisdom hero are still accomplished without the activity of the male deities. Likewise, there are valid Mother Tantra texts where the female deities do not accomplish the summoning and inducting, and there is no precluding some Tantras which manifest an arrangement common to both types of Tantras showing both kinds [of actions, by male and female deities]. Therefore, although the Vajra Rosary is an Explanatory Tantra common to both kinds of Tantras, its own actuality is said to be an art Tantra. Likewise, although the Time Machine explains both methods, its own actuality is considered to be a Yogini Tantra. 7 Three lunar years of days adds up to the number of 1080, which is more than the number of deities of the usual Time Machine mandala (722), which itself is two years of central channel days plus two.

Although they may wish to establish it as a nondual Tantra, they cannot find a [coherent] way to establish it as a nondual Tantra if they follow the intention of the Stainless Light. The Stainless Light established it as a nondual Tantra according to the above-explained ultimate reality \"art\" 18al and \"wisdom,\" but the \"art\" and ''wisdom\" concerning whether the art or the wisdom acts or does not act are explained in terms of superficial reality and the inclinations of dull-minded beings. This [commentary] teaches that the \"art\" and \"wisdom\" establish­ing the Father and Mother Tantras are according to whether the male or female meditative deities' activities are set up in terms of the inclinations of dull-minded beings, but does not teach that all kinds of \"art\" and \"wisdom\" establishing Tantras as \"father\" or \"mother\" are just the same. The Stainless Light also provides other means of establishing the two [kinds of] Tantras, stating that in art Tantras, the father and mother deities are equal in faces and arms due to the symbolism of equality of day and night; and in wisdom Tantras, the father and mother deities are unequal in faces and arms due to the symbolism of early and late between­watches. On the strength of this, some call [the Time Machine] a nondual Tantra in that the principal father and mother are unequal in number of faces and arms and the attendant deities have equality. But this does not seem worthwhile since that statement was made merely to show a reason as to why. in both Tantras, faces and arms are said to be equal or unequal, and not to establish the meaning of art and wisdom Tantras; since in those [statements] there seems to be no reference whatsoever to the meaning of \"male\" and \"female\" or \"art\" and \"wisdom.\" Furthermore, it seems they consider that being established as a non­dual Tantra is [a sign of being] superior to other Tantras; but even though it is established as a nondual Tantra by that (kind of] reason, such does not amount to any superior quality. For even though it happens that the chief deity's male and female forms have unequal numbers of faces and arms and their attendant deities have equal numbers, that aspect appears not to have any profound meaning.

Thus, 19hl the [Tibetan scholars'] explanation of the first quote is incorrect. Their explanation of the second quote is also not according to its (real] meaning. Just before that, the transcendent buddhas such as Ak�ho­bhya asked the bodhisattvas: How are the c;lakinis and yoginis gathered together in this vajra pavilion? And the answer was given by the bodhisattvas such as Maitreya: First the Vajra-holder Pronounces the will for enlightenment: \"I will liberate all living beings, Such as those born from eggs!\" So why should women be neglected? Striving to kill living beings ... and so forth up to: ... [is] explained as a [Mother] Tantra as mentioned above. Therefore, the Tantra taught as the essence of c;lakini Tantras in order to attract women is the Vajra Pavilion itself, since the context of the question is asking about the [Vajra] Pavilion. And as for calling it the essence of all Tantras, just before that it is stated: This essence is completely included In the Hevajra 500,000 and therefore no criterion for all Mother Tantras is intended; which can also be recognized in the expression \"even in a slight text.\" Well, then, one wonders what is the meaning of the exchange in the Vaj ra Pavilion asking, \"How are women attracted?\" In other treatises it is taught that in a woman's lifetime one cannot directly attain buddha­hood; and thus this question concerns the statement in the Unexcelled Tantras that it is better to achieve buddhahood in the embodiment of a woman.

In regard to the statement that: Yoga Tantras are taught In order to educate men. and Yoginuantras are taught In order to attract women. -it indicates here in this Vajra Pavilion Ta ntra, in general, even while being a Mother Tantra, it is called \"Yoga Tantra,\" as well as being called a \"Yoginli'antra\" intending that it was taught to attract women; as quoted above: The Hevajra, as a Yoga Tantra, Is first explained by the Victors; Then the same thing is said to be a Yoginifantra To attract those of female embodiment. First the [Hevajra] Extensive Ta ntra 500,000 [is taught] and then later it is abridged as the [Vajra] Pavilion Yoginf Ta ntra in order to include women. Further, in both sections of the [Vajra] Pavilion, the Hevajra is said to be a Mother Tantra. Thus the appellation \"Yoga Tantra\" means the category of \"Yoga Tantra\" that is the basis of differentiation into Yogi and Yoginuantras, and does not indicate the \"Yoga Tantra\" which is the opposite of the category \"Yoginifantra.\" Having already explained the way in which the [Vajra] Pavilion was taught to include women, this latter quote can be explained in that fashion, or otherwise it can be explained in terms of both Father and Mother Tantras.

However, usually in the Tantras and treatises, the 9 It may be that in agricultural societies the women haad to provide the food and so often had to slaughter animals to make dinner for the men and children.

In those contexts, not only the male but also the consort should be understood as a practitioner of the path; because it is repeatedly stated that just as the art is liberated conditioned by the wisdom, so the wisdom is liberated depending on the art.10 Although that process exists in both types of Tantras, the Father Tantras are not as extensive as the Mother Tantras about the nature and categories of criteria for the way of reliance on the consorts. Still, from that point of view, both Tantras are said to be taught in order to train both [males and females]. Furthermore, this is only an explanation of the purpose of the two Tantras, and not an establishment of the criteria for [distinguishing] Father and Mother Tantras. For example, the Esoteric Community is chiefly taught for the sake of the jewel-like person, and yet that fact is not a criterion for it being a Father Tantra. Otherwise, as it is said in some P akinifantras that they are taught for the sake of illuminating those of inferior intelligence, that too should become a criterion for their being Mother Tantras! Furthermore, these [Tibetan scholars'] way of explanation of the meaning of the quote from the Elucidation of the Esoteric Reality is also not according to its meaning. As said in that text: There are two kinds of [Tantras]: The four of the encounter of two And the [one] of the union of two. By their creation and perfection stages, The yogis are shown to be creative, and The perfective are called yoginis. The interpenetration of the two organs [Ita] Is called \"union.\" Thus, with regard to the fourth of the four Tantras of looking, touching and smiling, holding hands, and uniting, there are both Yoga and Yogini Tantras among those Tantras involving the union of two organs. The first explains the stage arisen from creation and the second explains the stage arisen from perfection, and does not explain that one teaches the creation 10 This is a very significant statement to support rejecting the contemporary unti - Tantra scholars who insist that Tantric practitioners were male ch auvinists w ho ust used women as minless tools for their own supposed spiritual advancement."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp stage and the other teaches the perfection stage. Just before that quote, it states: By the path of the glorious [Esoteric} Community, In regard to the actuality of the two stages, The glorious Community is extremely pleasing, And is pr incipal among all Tantras. This contradicts the notion that Yoga Tantras, such as the Community, chiefly teach the creation stage and do not chiefly teach the perfection stage. As for [these Tibetan scholars'] saying that Kf�hl).acharya believed that Father Tantras begin with \"Thus have I heard ... \" and Mother Tantras begin with \"Delighted by the supreme secret ... \" and so forth; this is not his belief. He did not mention those two-\"Thus have I heard\" for Father Tantras, and \"Delighted by supreme secret\" for the Mother Tantras-as criteria for [distinguishing) the two Tantras, but only [to show] their non­difference in [both] being the actuality of the union of bliss and voidness. The quote supporting this has already been cited above. Other than these, some Indians and Tibetans have promoted various methods of establishing the two Tantras, but in most cases it appears that the \"male-female\" or \"art-wisdom\" lllbl used as criteria for art and wis­dom Tantras have no relevance whatsoever. They do not seem to explain the distinctions about being taught chiefly and not taught chiefly, or about what sort of \"art\" and \"wisdom\" are involved when they say that \"[such and such] chiefly teaches art and wisdom.\" Their explanations of criteria are easily understood as invalid, coming from just noticing what corresponds to the two Tantras. Therefore, I do not discuss them. [1.8.2.b.ii.H'2' -Establishing the most worthwhile position] Well, then, what do we take as the method for establishing Father Tantras and Mother Tantras? Although there are some ordinary distinctions acceptable for dif­ferentiating them from the point of view of the creation stage, it is more importantly necessary to differentiate them from the point of view of [their respective] perfection stages. The establishment of all of them as nondual Tantras is based on the art and wisdom of bliss and voidness, which [bliss-void art-wisdom] does not differentiate them as art and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Chapter /-Introduction· 53 wisdom Tantras, as explained above. It is also not proper to establish them [as different] according to their emphasis with regard to [superficial art and wisdom], since this would incur the fault that one would have to put Hevajra as a Father Tantra and the Community as a Mother Tantra; for \"bliss\" is emphasized in Mother Tantras such as Hevajra and not mentioned emphatically in the Community. Thus, as for the \"art\" and \"wisdom\" mentioned in differentiating the Tantras from the point of view of their perfection stages, \"wisdom\" is the ultimate great bliss intuition, and \"art\" is the superficial magic body. In regard to that, the Vajra Pavilion, Chapter 13, sets up the Mother Tantras from the point of view of the former: \"Divine Lord, how does one apply the name 'Yogini Tantra'?\" Vajradhara replied: The art of transcendent wisdom [t2al Is expressed as the yogini. By uniting with the great seal, One enters into that reality, And it is called the \"Yogini Tantra.\" Here, it clearly states the designative criterion [for its being a Mother Tantra] in general terms. This means that, due to the connection of those two, because the Tantra teaches the way of entering the voidness of ulti­mate suchness through union with the great seal, the [Vajra] Pavilion and so forth are called Yogini Tantras. This is the reason [the Vajra Pavilion] is established as a \"Mother Tantra,\" and that is the meaning of the two [lines] beginning \"art of transcendent wisdom.\" To explain this in detail: [a Tantra] is called a \"Mother Tantra\" when it does not mainly teach how to achieve the superficial magic body from the wind-energy of five-colored light rays that carries the great bliss intuition, and does mainly teach the process of exponential increase of realization that penetrates the ultimate voidness of suchness through the yoga of the indivisible bliss-void of the orgasmic great seal. [This is] the art of generating the four joys both in falling order, where the lily-white spirit of enlightenment falls from the crown to the penis, and in rising order, where it reverses back up into the crown. For this art of achieving the truth body of the innate transcendent wisdom is also the yoga of the indivisible union of bliss and void, and since its main component for"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp achieving the truth body is the wisdom of the void side, it is called \"mother.\" 11 From the perspecive of the second, as for setting up the Yogll'antras, the Angel Ocean clearly states: In the royal Tantras for the yogi/nis, The various (12bl methods are distinctly known.12 I explain to the world the magic [body] For [attaining] clear light magic body [union]. As for the meaning of this, \"explain\" means \"cite.\" \"Where?\" In the kings of the Yoga Tantras. \"What?\" The magic body. \"To whom?\" \"To the world,\" to such disciples. \"By whom?\" \"By myself' says the Teacher. \"How?\" Through the clear light with its three preceding voids, there is the art of achieving the magic body by the process of the four voids. \"How is it achieved?\" The analyses of the various methods stated in that Tantra can be especially well known. To expand on that meaning: [a Tantra] is called a \"Yogi\" [Father] Tantra when it mainly teaches the way of achieving the superficial magic body from the five-colored light-ray wind-energy of clear light and the way of generating the intuition of voidness through the four voids in the emergent order through the process of the wind-energy's gradual collect­ing in the heart-the place where the clear light arises- and the four voids in the reverse order through the process of [that wind-energy] resurrecting back out from there. This is also the yoga of the indivisible actual union of the void intuition and the wind-energy-constituted body, and its main component is the art of the vision side for achieving the material body; thus it is called \"father.\"13 As for the meaning of the quote from the Eluciclation of the I Eso­teric} Reality, it is similar to the above two (quotes], since it indicates that the two types of Tantra mainly teach (respectively) the process where 11 This plll' agruph stands as Tsong Khupu's most complete definition of the \"Mother\" type of Unexcelled Yoga Tantru. 12 My tran slalion follows lhe quole in Tson� Khapu's texl. as preferable lo the varian! in the Derge edilion; sec foolnole to lhe Tibc:lan edilon (forthcoming). 13 This paragruph slands us Tsong Khapu 's prime definition of \"Father\" Tantru."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Chapter /-Introduction· 55 the magic body arises from the four voids and the process where the entry into thatness achieved as perfect from the beginning increases exponen­tially. As for the meaning of \"mainly teach or not [13aJ teach,\" it concerns whether or not a particular Tantra teaches by putting the main emphasis on the one [or the other] method, and not merely whether or not it teaches [whichever art at all]. As it seems that authoritative authors have a way of explaining those two distinctions as the principal ones of the Father and Mother Tantras respectively, other art and wisdom Tantras being members included in those categories.

[�- Explanations of the Esoteric Community in particular] The second has two parts: (a.] Showing the meaning of \"Root Tantra\" and \"Further Tantra,\" and showing the number of [their] Explana­tory Tantras; and [b.] Showing the way in which the Explanatory Tantras explain. [I.C.2.a.-Showing the meaning of \"Root Tantra\" and \"Further Tantra,'' and showing the number of (their) Explanatory Tantras ] The Vajra Rosary Commentary [by Alari:J.kakalasha] explains that the Esoteric Community has an extensive [14a] 25,000 verse version, and a condensed 1,800 verse, eighteen-chapter, version; [so in the quote above,] the \"thousand\" refers to number of verses, and thus, the Esoteric Community 1,000 mentioned above intends a rough count of the con­densed version. What are the \"root,\" \"further,\" and \"explanatory\" Tantras here? Among Root Tantras, there are the Extensive (rgyas pa), and the Light (nyung ngu) or Condensed (bsdus pa) Tantras. This shows that first [Buddha] proclaimed the extremely extensive Tantra and that later, since the disciples were relatively inferior in terms of lifespan and wisdom, he taught in a more condensed fashion, as they were not able to understand too easily. These two Tantras, except for the mere difference of their words being more or less, are both Root Tantras, the former not being a Root Tantra for the latter. As for the meaning of \"root\" in \"Root Tantra,\" there appear to be three contexts: [1] one relative to the branches of the Tantra, as the root of a tree is designated relative to the branches; [2] one in terms of time, as the first owner of something is called the root-owner, relative to the 16 Actually 29 in the above list."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58 · Brilliant Illumination of tht• Lamp Further Tantra: and ( -�] one in terms of the Explanatory Tantra, as in the usages \"roo t\" and \"explanatory.\" As for the first of these contexts. Chandrakirti indicates it in the Illumination of the Lamp statement that the Community is the root of all ll\"hl the other Tantras: just how it becomes their root being explained below. Since it is both a \"root\" and a \"Tantra,\" the meaning of \"Root Tantra'' is complete in it; it is not self-evident that the name \"Root Tantra\" should be a literally exact name. As for the second [context], it is illustrated in the case of the pre­viously stated seventeen-chapter Community relative to the later-stated Eighteenth Chapter, which is the Further Ta ntra. Naropa states that the Reality Compendium is a Root Tantra, the Community Root Ta ntra is its Further Ta ntra, and the Eighteenth Chapter is again the latter's Further Ta ntra. \"Further\" (Sanskrit uttara), literally \"unexcelled\" or \"highest,\" can be translated either \"superior\" (mchog) or \"further\" (phyi ma); some do translate it as \"superior,\" but the great translators seem correct in translating it as \"further,\" as that is how commentaries also explain it. It also seems that the intention of the Integrated Practices is that the Reality Compendium is a Root Tantra relative to the Esoteric Community. What is the reason for assigning the Reality Compendium as a Root Tantra for the Community, since it is not merely due to temporal priority? Granted that the Community is not a Yoga Tantra from among the four Tantra classes, still in general many statements are made there in the context of the Yoga Tantra, and thus it has been said that it [the Commu­nity] and the Reality Compendium constitute the entire Yoga Tantra class. Further, the Reality Compendium, tending toward the \"father\" side, taking art and wisdom as father and mother, is also a Father Tantra accord­ing to the One Hundred Fifty Ways Commentary. [I5aJ Also, in the six­teenth chapter of the Illumination of the Lamp, it is said concerning some topics of the consecrations that they should be understood from the Reality Compendium. Such are explained or designated intending the fact that the primary basis is contained there. Here one might object that, if a Further Tantra is said to be a later explanation of an original subject, then there are fal lacies such as: the concise teaching of the meaning of the Tantra in the first chapter of the Community itself stands in relation to the next sixteen chapters, which elucidate it as a Root Tantra to a Further Tantra, and even that each suc­ceeding chapter is a Further Tantra to the last one; if you do not say that"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter /-Introduction · 59 such is the criterion of a Further Tantra, then you must say what is [the criterion]! [As for the third context, concerning the meaning of \"Root Tantra.\" in terms of the Explanatory Tantra, as in the usages \"root\" and \"explana­tory\"]: there are many methods of setting up a Further Tantra in general: here let us explain the criterion for setting up the Community Further Ta ntra. The Eighteenth Chapter is both part of the Community Ta ntra and also was spoken later than the Community Root Ta ntra, and it eluci­dates the general meaning of the whole seventeen-chapter Root Tantra as well as the hidden difficulties of each chapter. Hence it is called the Co mmunity Further Ta ntra. Therefore, there is no fallacy of each suc­ceeding chapter becoming the \"Further Tantra\" of its preceding chapter. Regarding the Explanatory Tantras of the Community, the Noble father and sons have explicitly mentioned five: the Five Stages states that the Four Goddess Dialogue, the Revelation of the Hidden Intention , and the Vajra Rosary are Explanatory Tantras: the Lamp of Integrated Prac­tices states that the Wisdom Vajra Compendium is an Explanatory Tantra: and the Illumination of the Lamp explicitly mentions the King of the Gods Dialogue as the source of the explanation of the first two syllables of the prologue [E-VAM ... ]. But, since there appears in just that latter [text, the Illumination of the Lamp] the statement that \"the explanation [t5b l of the remaining syllables [can be learned] from the Explanatory Tantras ... ,\" it is not the case that the King of the Gods Dialogue is explicitly identified as an Explanatory Tantra. Further, it does not seem that the father and sons explicitly mentioned the [Community] Eighteenth Chapter as an Explanatory Tantra, although they did mention it as a Further Tantra. How­ever, it must be accepted as an Explanatory Tantra, as Thagana [Siddha] and Jinadatta [Pa�;H,lita] so accepted it. There are some who believe the Vajra Essence Ornament Ta ntra and the Magic Net to be Explanatory Tantras, but they are not, though they do correspond with the Community. The Four Goddess Dialogue Commentary mentions a Further Tantra within the Supreme of All Secrets 1 ,000. The Vajra Rosary Commentary explains that there are two Vajra Rosary Ta ntras, a 12,000 and a smaller one, and that the Wisdom Vajra Compendium also has a greater and a smaller, explaining that the previ­ously quoted Vajra Rosary has 300,000 verses. As for the Revelation of the Hidden Intention, it was not translated as more than an Explanatory Tantra of the first twelve chapters of the Root Tantra."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [I.C.2.b.-Showing the way in which the Explanatory Tantras explain I The second has two parts: [i] How the Further Ta ntra and the Reve­lation of the Hidden Intention explain; and [ii] How the [other] three, such as the Vajra Rosary, explain. [I.C.2.h.i.-How the Further Ta ntra and the Revelation of the Hidden Intention Explain] The other Community Explanatory Tantras explain it but are not themselves the Community Ta ntra, whereas the Further Ta ntra is both. As for how it explains the Root Ta ntra, its explanation of the [16aJ common meanings of the Tantra lies in its dialogues about: the meaning of the name of the Tantra, \"Glorious Esoteric Community Yo ga Ta ntra,\" its clas­sification as an art Tantra, and the general scheme of the Tantra. Its other sections explain particular points from each of the seventeen chapters. This commentary, inquiring into the [very practice of] elucidating the Tantra, is the most perfect elucidation, arranging ingeniously all the meanings of the Tantra. It was admired by Naropa, since it is so splendid. In response to the inquiry, it is explained that, of the four groups of four chapters from the second to the seventeenth, each teaches one of the branches of service and practice. Naropa explained also that the first chapter gives the Tantra' s import in brief and the other sixteen chapters explain the four branches of service and practice, and the eighteenth teaches the esoteric instruction for all of them. These chapters do not distinguish the two stages, but teach the four branches of service and practice in common for the two stages. However, [the Further Ta ntra] teaches the four branches of service and practice distinguishing between the two stages in the context of [explaining] the category of \"art Tantra.\" Each Explanatory Tantra has its own way of explaining the Root Ta ntra due to its [author's] particular orientation toward a special emphasis. But this Further Ta ntra explains the Root Ta ntra according to the four branches of service and practice set forth in the twelfth chapter. It is said in the Dialogue on the Glorious Meaning of the Commentary that the six­teen chapters explain the four branches, and the inquiries into the indi­vidual chapters are included in that. r t6bJ The inquiry into the classification as art Tantra is the very same as the inquiry into the meaning of the name. Thus, as the general import is included in the inquiry into the meaning of the name, it can be implied"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Chapter /-Introduction · 61 that the Root Ta ntra text can be explained mainly as explaining the name of the Tantra; which is a cause of extreme wonderment! Here, since it is difficult to discern how the four-chapter sections explain the four branches of practice and service, one must know how to explain the Root Ta ntra through a good understanding of how to elucidate this, how to discern the boundaries of the four branches in each of the two stages, and especially how to explain the six branches of service of the perfection stage. And it appears that understanding how the noble system explains the Further Ta ntra depends on the same commentary of Naropa. The Revelation of the Hidden Intention [Tantra] orders its chapters in the same way as in the Root Ta ntra, and mentions almost everything mentioned in the Root Ta ntra' s chapters, so that it serves as a commen­tary elucidating the difficult points of each chapter. It concisely states that, \"such and such is the import taught by each of the seventeen chapters of this Root Ta ntra.\" It indicates how it is improper to explain the Commu­nity always literally, and elucidates the hidden definitive meanings of the interpretable meaning statements. It explains thoroughly the intentional interpretations given to one import by other [apparently] contradictory statements. It clearly teaches most often the vajra recitation practice hidden in the Root Tantra in almost every chapter. Therefore, emphasizing this [ 17aJ recitation practice it explains the Root Ta ntra according to those pro­cedures. In the Illumination of the Lamp most quotes \"from the Explana­tory Ta ntra\" are from this source, quoted as emphasizing the definitive meaning explanations. [I.C.2.b.ii.-How the (other) three such as the Vajra Rosary explain] The Vajra Rosary Short Tantra [translations] have three different ways of dividing its Chapters 19 and 20. The Commentary explains that, at the beginning of Chapter 19 [of the Vajra Rosary], from [the lines]: Then still more should be explained, The self-instantaneous in variety, and so on ... up to [the lines]: ... Various aspects are eagerly accepted except for nine quarter-verses, the text of the end of the nineteenth chapter did not extend further, and \"was left here.\" After that, from [the line]:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"62 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Then yet another should be explained ... up to [the line]: ... This should be understood from the succession of mentors ... is taken as the twentieth chapter. In general the Commentary takes it to have sixty-eight chapters. I? The translation of the Lha Lama Zhiwa Od is the same as above, up to \"various aspects are eagerly desired,\" but after that it takes out the verses from \"Gazing, attracting, and also signaling, know the experience of kissing and its delight\" up to \"experiencing the orgasmic joy, an instant free from identity\" and makes them the nineteenth chapter, the analysis of instantaneity. Then it takes the verses from \"Then yet another should be explained, the character of the four joys ... \" up to \"naturally born in the circle of emanations, let one experience joy\" [17bl as the twentieth chapter, the analysis of the character of joy. In general, it has sixty-eight chapters. As for the Zhiwa Od translation revised by Darma Tsondru, it is the same up to \"various aspects are accepted,\" and afterwards it repeats the verses from \"Then yet another should be explained, the character of the four joys\" up to \"naturally born in the circle of emanations, let one experience joy.\" After that it repeats from \"Gaze, attract, and also signal\" up to \"the experience of natural joy, an instant free of identity.\" And after that, from \"The great space of all the channels\" up to \"the experience of natural joy, an instant free of identity,\" and from \"The great space of all the channels\" up to \"it should be known from the mentor succession\"- it takes all these as the nineteenth chapter, the nature of the universal joy, and generally takes it to have sixty-seven chapters. Thus, though there appear to be many such variations, the chapter divisions of the translation by Sujana ShrTjiUlna and Zhiwa Od and the Indian book of Pa�;u,tita Mantrakalasha seem to be correct; because there is evident in the text both one passage explaining the four instants in forward and reverse order and another passage explaining the four joys 17 Though the commentary as we have it in the Tengyur today only includes explanations of 44 chapters, Wld the commentary quote often diverge from the verses in the translaton of the mot text.

In this Tantra, Vajrapa1.1i wishes- while referring to the Vajra Rosary-to inquire into the two stages, which are unclearly stated only by symbols in the Esoteric Community, and precedes his speech by the expression, \"Please teach mainly from the point of view of the perfection stage.\" He then asks his questions concerning topics from the meaning of the name of the Vajra Rosary up to the nature and the way of destruction of the wind-energies. The answers to those questions explain most of the meanings of the Community and also many meanings of the Yogini Tantras, such as the [Unexcelled] Clear Articulat ion 100,000, although those explanations are given mostly as a factor of decisively determining the import of the Community. The number of the questions and answers is said by the Commentary to be eighty-two. What does this Tantra explain of the Community text in plain terms? While it explains much of the Root Ta ntra's third chapter and sixth chapter statements about the meditation of the mustard-seed-size jewels at the nosetips, chiefly this Tantra explains the meaning of each syllable of the prologue \"E VA M MA YA ,\" and so on, the forty syllables which the Illumination of the Lamp says contain all the meanings of the Tantra, each by a verse such as \"E is the holy wisdom .... \" Those texts [18b1 teach mainly body isolation, speech isolation, mind isolation, and the magic body, also teaching repeatedly in other contexts the clear light and communion; thus teaching the complete per­fection stage. The scheme of that path is taken as the five stages because that same text [the Vajra Rosary] declares: Through application to the vajra recitation, Knowing the nature of the energies, Cut off the energies of mental constructions, You will attain the mind objective.

Therefore, when His Holiness [Nagarjuna] in the Condensed [Sadhana] becomes an [alchemical] churner, he \"churns the ocean of hidden waters of the Esoteric Community with the churning stick of the Vajra Rosary.\"18 Thus his statement about finding the art of the practice of the Community was not just referring to the creation stage. It explains the many stages of creation and dissolution of the body in terms of the channel-structure, wind-energy-movement, and enlightenment-spirit­substance as a factor in the decisive ascertainment 1 t9aJ of the internal and external life-energy controls for bringing forth the four voids and the magic body, depending on the life-energy controls of the outer seal of the hidden discipline of desire and of the vajra recitation, and so on. Beyond those two techniques, it further explains the limitless ways for the dawn­ing of realization, and so forth. It also declares many things such as the scheme of consecrations for attaining receptivity for the path condensed into twenty rites, the schemes for condensing the creation stage, and the determinations of the sequence of the two stages. Especially, the sixth chapter explains the keys for the life-energy-control vajr a recitation to open up the knot of the heart channels, and the twenty-second chapter section which collects the definitive meaning mantras of the three syllables explains how the unravelling of the heart-channel-knot is the supreme unravelling of a channel-knot of all the wheels [of channels].

Therefore. I must somewhat explain that below. The statement from the translator's c olophon of this text that \"among Explanatory Tantras a better one than this has not previ­ously appeared,\" still seems to be just how it is. The Four Goddess Dialogue chiefly explains in detail the keys of the life-energy-control yogas.

The details of how these two Tantras explain the Community will not be mentioned here, as I have already explained them in the extensive commentaries of those two texts.19 Thus, inquiring thoroughly into the texts containing the private instructions of the holy father and son, with the key for easily extracting the pith of the meaning, discerning accurately with the help of the Explanatory Tantras the meanings sealed behind the door of the Root Ta ntra by the six parameters and four procedures, one should be able to open the door of the Root Tantra. One then becomes one who has the personal precept granting confidence in personal Tantric instruction.

This statement of being the root of the Tantras whose names end in the consonant letters is a mere example, and the Masters Bhavyakirti and Kumara explain that it means that it is also the root of all Tantras whose names end in vowels as well. The \"three syllables\" mentioned in \"their root is the three syllables\" are explained by Naropa to be the three [buddha] seeds [OM AJJ HOM]; the former scholars of Tibet considered them to be SA MA JA. The former of these is explained in the Further Ta ntra as the three secrets of body, speech, and mind, which are united in the Esoteric Community; thus, the Community Ta ntra is identified from the perspective of what it is uniting. Not taking this [instrument of uniting] as referring to the Community Ta ntra, but explaining it as coming down to the three vajr as, the three syllables that are the import of all Tantras, would be to ignore the context, since that statement teaches that the Community Ta ntra is the root of all the Tantras.

Kr�huacharya praised the intensive path of the Community with regard to both stages, from the perspective of its being the chief of all the Tantras, as has been previously quoted. [2lhl There are no degrees of superior and inferior among the Unexcelled Yoga Tantras, as among the three lower Tantra divisions, from the point of view of the stages [of practice]. Yet it is not that there are no degrees of superiority with regard to certain other distinctions.

Among the passages of the Community, this treatise mainly determines the meaning of the opening. It teaches the four meditations with their [appropriate] actions as the following stages of the path: first, the creation stage which sets up the syllables; second, characterizing your own nature as thatness while depending on the action seal; third, meditating depending on the intuition-seal in order to stabilize [that designation of your nature]; and fourth, meditation on the realization of the great seal. This text counts the deities of the mandala contained within this [fourfold process] to be seventeen.

Therefore, that refers just to the circle of buddhas, buddhesses, heroes, and heroines which complete the mandala of deities -just that much is taught in the prologue.

It does not appear that Master Saraha made a special commentary on the Esoteric Community. The great soul Nagarjuna composed an elucidation of the meaning of the Community. We will explain his system's way of elucidation. Master Lalitavajra composed an explanation of the Tantra's pro­logue only, and does not appear to have treated separately the style of the path of the two stages. Then the disciple of Lalitavajra, the great master Jiianapada, received the explanation of the meaning of the Community from the noble Maiiju­shri [in person], and the stages [as given in his work] are renowned as the system of Jiianapada. There are two stages in his path: his creation stage having a mandala of nineteen deities headed by Maiijuvajra, according to the explanations in the Samantabhadra Sadhana, and in !22hl the Four Hundred Fifty. His perfection stage is given in the Persona/Instruction taught by His Holiness [Maiijushri], and in the Liberation Drop composed by the master himself."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Chapter /-Introduction· 71 From the Personal Instruction, at the beginning of meditating the perfection stage he explains the meditation of the indestructible drop in the heart, the branch of \"life-energy control\" called the \"branch of stop­ping the breath\" in the meditation of the secret drop on the gem; by meditating that produces the branch of restraint called the \"endurance\" branch, then the branch of \"mindfulness\" meditating the sixteen mindful­nesses, then the vajra recitation called the emanation drop, and finally the repeated meditation of the indestructible drop in the heart center, medi­tated exclusively in terms of the intuitive orgasmic wisdom. It seems that this [master] explains only the last four of the six branches, leaving out the two branches \"retraction\" and \"contemplation\" which are in the Further Ta ntra. The implication of such a method of explanation is that he seems to consider that those two should be included in the creation stage, just as in the Jiianapada system's texts on the six-branched yoga, where retraction and contemplation are taught in the creation stage. In the context of this [system], the import of the statements in the Further Ta ntra that the ordinary service is the \"four vajras\" and the superior service is the \"six branches\" is not that [master Jiianagarbha] considers the superior service and the creation stage to be mutually exclu­sive.

Yet. since Abhaya and Samayavajra explain in their commentaries that the Noble Master's disciple Shakyamitra composed the Second Stage, we must accept the \"condensed [sadhana]\" as one stage of the five. as they attest. Munishribhadra also asserts this. In Lak�hmi's commentary, she gives two explanations: her own, in which the Master himself wrote the Second Stage, his adept's name being Nagarjuna and his monk's name being Shakyamitra; and someone else's, in which. while the Master 12Sal him­self wrote it, he attached his disciple's name to it as a sign of his great pleasure with him.

Well then, why is it explained that the Second Stage was written by Shakyamitra? It does not seem that this was entirely composed by the Noble master, since its alternative explanations of \"By the noble vajra's kind­ness, many Tantras were heard\" seem incorrect; since it is supplied with a separate dedication in the end; and since, if the Noble master had com­posed all of this second stage, his apparent explaining in that context of many things to be explained in the context of the \"Clear Light\"27 [fourth] and \"Communion\" [fifth chapters] seems improper. On the other hand, if the entire chapter was composed by the Noble [Master]'s disciple, Shakya­mitra: expressions such as \"The Noble Master condensed the perfection stage into five stages\" would seem incorrect, and it is obvious that the 27 The fourth stage is sometimes called \"manifest enlightenment\" and sometimes \"clear light.\""},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp appearance of Aryadeva's [25bJ two citations [from the Second Stage text] as \"according to the Unexcelled Intention\" would be inaccurate.

If we accept it that way, the single text called the \"Five Stages\" is taken to have five chapters, including the first portion of the second stage [chapter], and we can infer that, of the two names of the second stage [chapter], the name given by the Noble Master is the \"Unexcelled Inten­tion.\" If we do not interpret in that way, then the Five Stages cannot be taken as a single text, since the Condensed [Sadhanaj is a separate text, and because the Second Stage [text] has a different author. Furthermore, if it is according to that, the statement in the colophon of the first chapter, \"This is the first, the stage of Vajra recitation,\" would become improper to leave alone. In any case, one knows from the \"Vaj ra Recitation Stage\" [chapter] that the Noble master condensed [the perfection stage] into five, making the \"Mind Objective\" the second stage; and that also appears to be the intention of the Stage of Arrangement.

The fact that they think thus critically about questions of author­ship and false attribution, requires us to take more seriously their insistence that Nagar­juna, Aryadeva, Chandrakirti, and many others who wrote important Tantric treatises were the same persons who also wrote well-known philosophical treatises. 32 This passage in the Derge redaction (see note to Tibetan text) gives more detail than in Tsong Khapa's paraphrase: \"There has been a decline for a long time in the treatises written by the bodhisattva Nagarjuna, who went to the Sukhavati buddhaverse, and in the society of his disciples; since his sun has set, the interpretive tradition is not at aU clear.\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Patsab transmitting what the adept Vajrasanaguru had said.

Since the miraculous activities of the Community entered the life of this mentor, he had many disciples upholding his pioneering style of teaching, producing four sages in each phase of his life, early, middle, and late, and the con­tinuum of his teaching still survives until today.

Further, granted that the characteristics of the physical foundation of the disciple need not be newly achieved, the characteristics of the excel­lences of the mental foundation, such as faith in the Dharma, reverence for the mentor, constant perseverance in the tenfold path of virtuous action, wide learning in the textual teaching, and effort motivated by the intense aspiration of resolve to save living beings; these are not spon­taneous in beginning disciples and so must be newly created. They are not to be generated after having been [mistakenly] recognized as origi­nally fit and already having been introduced into the vehicle of Mantra. Thus, those qualities of the fit vessel are produced by cultivating the mind in the path common to both [exoteric and esoteric] Universal Vehicles. As the Vajrapil!Ji Initiation Ta ntra [32a] also states: \"0 great bodhisattva!

After having established this necessity of the method of gradual learning, he declares that you must cultivate the spirit of enlightenment, the aspiration of the Universal Vehicle, the buddha-vehicle.

He then teaches the great import and the difficulty of finding evolutionary leisure; you educate yourself in that attitude and generate the great ambition to extract the essence of this life of evolutionary leisure. The best way to take this essence is to enter the Universal Vehicle; of which the door is the spirit of enlightenment itself. If this authentically emerges in your personal experience, you become a non-artificial universalist. If it is just lip service, you become merely a verbal universalist. Thus, the wise person (JJaJ dispels gradually the resistance to that spirit, and conceives it in complete form. Prior to that, if you have not reversed your ambition for this life, it will be an obstacle either to the Individual or Universal Vehicle; so you should be mindful of death. This life will not last long. Then, you should reflect on the wandering in the bad states after death, which will reverse the interest in this life. After that, you can reverse the interest that craves successes in the future life by thinking over thoroughly the drawbacks of all states of the life cycle. In this way, you should orient the mind to tran­scendent liberation. After that, in order to reverse the interest in your own peace and happiness, you should persist in cultivating love, compassion, and the spirit of enlightenment rooted in them; in this way, you cultivate the non­artificial spirit of enlightenment. Then, having recognized the deeds of the bodhisattvas, you generate the desire to learn them. When you can take up the burden of the deeds of the buddha-children, you can uphold the bodhisattva vow and practice its precepts. When you can take up the burden of the vow and commitments of the vajra vehicle, studying the Mentor Fifty, and perfecting the ways of relying on the mentor, you should enter into the Mantra [vehicle]. Intending such a procedure, Rahula!hrimitra, the eminent member of the Noble tradition of the Esoteric Community, said, [in his Illumina­tion of the Communion]: At such a stage, At a time of favorable date and stars, The disciple should join palms together and bow, Confess all sins, And renew the threefold refuge.

The vows of the upasaka layman and its purification, the monk-for-a-day vow, are in terms of the householders. The monastics who enter the Tantras must totally purify their vows of renunciation and so on.

Without gaining a precise general understanding of quiescence and insight, even the subtle samadhi will become erroneous. Until you have gained certitude about the view of selflessness, which precludes all such [errors], you should practice the general path of the two Universal Vehicles. This is the precept emerging from the confluence of three streams. one descending from His Holiness Maitreya through Asanga, one from His Holiness Mafijuiui through Naga.rjuna, and the last [also from Mafi­juilri] through Shantideva. The great Lord AtiSha maintained that this teaching must be employed whether you enter the door of the Vajra Vehicle or that of the Transcendence Vehicle. Well, one may wonder if this is the position of the Tibetan mentors of the Esoteric Community. The Master Go also taught that the meaning of the above quote from the Integrated Practices was that the prerequisite of both creation and perfection stages is the cultivation of the view that realizes voidness and the spirit of enlightenment rooted in compassion. The Four Point Treatise39 [by Serdingpa]-the instruction in the five stages of the Marpa tradition-explains that the yogi/ni with complete initiation must practice by establishing the basis for achieving the path. One must take refuge in the three jewels, have confidence in the ripening of the fruits of evolu­tion, habituate oneself to the ten virtues, take the vow of individual libera­tion preceded by the common refuge, and develop the aspiring and acting spirit [of enlightenment], [34bl preceded by the uncommon refuge. This teaching, which shows in detail how to guide the mind in that way, is called the \"stages of the path.\" So it is not that such is not the system of the former Tibetan mentors who learned the Community path. Having developed a rather thorough understanding of the complete body of the path, you should actually begin to practice such a teaching distinctive from others by its provision of a complete basis for progress­ing on the path. This is the program for practicing the ordinary path, which I have already explained elsewhere [in the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment]. 39 See note to the text under the Tibetan folio 68b below."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"CHAPTER [[ General Learning of the Ta ntric Path (34b.3-66a.3J [YIJL-The way of learning the special. uncommon Community path 1 The second has four parts: [ l.] How to become a fit vessel for the path of the two stages; [2.] Having become fit, how to purify vows and commitments; [3.] Having purified vows and commitments, how to meditate; and [4.] How the fruition will be attained at meditation's end. IVI.B.l - How to become a fi t vessel for the path of the two stages I When a qualified master has initiated a fit disciple with the initation rites proclaimed in the Tantras, with their import having been elucidated by the authorities, the door of the Mantra [Vehicle] teaching is opened, setting in place the infallible relativity for the path to be developed in personal experience and the fruition to be attained. Hence, having first become a fit vessel for entrance into Mantra, one should achieve the second fitness authorizing one's study of the path of Mantra by means of the pure initiation. I have already explained that process elsewhere [in my Stages of the Path of Great Vajradhara]. I'VI.B.2.-Having become fit, how to purify vows and commitments] During the time of initiation, one calls to witness all the mentors, buddhas, and bodhisattvas [35a] and undertakes to uphold the vows and pledges taken in their presence. So it is indispensible to know how to [uphold them] and to have the experience of maintaining [them], before one can contemplate the path .. The procedure of doing that should be learned from the previous extensive explanations in the Mentor Fifty, the Vo w Upholding, the Famous Treatise, and the Elucidation of the Root Downfalls and Gross Infractions. When one finds certitude in the fact that the practices concerning the pure initiations and the vows must begin to lead one into the two stages, one's preliminary practices such as mentor yoga, the hundred syllable [mantra-recitation], and the mandala [offering] come in the wake 93"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"94 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of that [initiation, as is proper.

[VI.B.3. -Having puri f ied vows and commitments, how to meditate] The third has three parts: [a.] Verifying the order of the two stages; [b.] How to meditate the two stages in order; and [c.] The conduct which is the method of bringing out the impact of the two stages. [VI.B.3.a. -Verifying the order of the two stages] The person who aspires to the ultimate does not fail to meditate the creation stage. One fo llows the order of meditation by first thoroughly cultivating the creation stage and later entering the perfection stage. [Nagarjuna,] in the Five Stages, makes the order definite: To those well situated on the creation stage And yet aspiring to the perfection stage, The perfect buddhas taught this method Just like the rungs of a ladder. [Aryadeva adds] in the Integrated Practices, which extensively elucidates the intention of the Five Stages: \"Alienated individuals such as us, through our beginning­less habitual investment in the variety of outer [35bJ things, are involved in the habitual investment in conceptual thinking by the cause of the [reificatory ] instincts for intrinsic realities in such [things] as existence and non­existence. one and many. duality and nonduality, neither existence nor non-existence, permanence and imperma­nence. Thus if they learn the samadhi of the perfection stages, must they practice according to the usual stages? Or may they spiritually realize those instantaneously through the personal precept of the mentor?\" The Vajra Master replies, \"Practice entering by stages, and not suddenly.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter 11-Learning the Ta ntric Path · 95 Thus, when asked: if those who are engaged with objects under the influence of instincts beginninglessly invested in the four extremes should practice the perfection [stages] beginning gradually from the first stages, or should practice suddenly by means of a profound precept of a mentor, without needing such [a gradual procedure]� [Aryadeva] answers that, other than gradual practice, there is no door of sudden entrance. And he establishes that by quoting the authority of the Mission to Lan ka [Satra] and the Heroes' March Samadhi Satra. Thus, even if it were thought that the finest, jewel-like disciple to enter this path would never [need to] have a beginner's stage, there would result the absurdity that one should be liberated from the beginning without requiring any path [at all]. It is essential that one accept [the inevitability of having] a beginner's stage. One must accept [Aryadeva's] statement in the Integrated Practices: In order for beginner [36a] beings To enter into the ultimate reality, The perfect buddhas created this artful system, Just like like rungs of a ladder. Here some protest that the sudden practice is taught thinking of some powerful persons who practiced the lower paths in many former lives, and so [in this life] do not need to be led through lower paths but are properly led through the higher paths. 40 This is like saying: when one investigates whether or not one needs first to go through the paths of accumulation and application to generate the insight path, one does not need any preliminary accumulation or appli­cation paths, giving the reason that one has already attained the insight path. It is a ridiculous [because so obvious] objection. Thus, just as, although one can put one's boat aside when one gets across a river, one must still depend on it while crossing; so, although one can abandon the creation stage once one has attained the non-artificial, core realization of the perfection stage, the artificial creation stage is necessary in the process of attaining that. Thus for the beginner, the creation stage is very highly recommended and very important. As the Vajra Angel states: 40 Here we encounter a definitive position taken in regard to the nowadays still controver­sial debate between sudden enlightenment and gradual enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"96 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp In order to realize the core yoga One should practice the artificial Meditation and recitation. Once one realizes the core yoga, Since it is re alized by going out Beyond the artificial yoga, One should not practice any artifice.

All those accomplishments are present here [in the creation stage], But not in the knowledge reality of the Victor. The same points are made in the Liberation Drop and the Spring Drop. Also. as for the meaning of some statements in them that not liberation but only painful hardships will be attained by striving in the artificial practices, they mean that such will be the re sult if one only strives in such paths and does not [go on to] meditate the perfection stage [at all]. They do not mean that one who aspires to enlightenment should not employ those [artificial practices]. One can understand this by applying the meaning of the example of the boat. So do not make the statement about abandoning the boat on the other side of the water your grounds for abandoning the boat on this side of the water! Here one might object that it is all right to establish the definite­ness in the order of the two stages by references from the Tantras, but how can references from So tras establish anything? [SO tra references were also used here ] to help us understand that, although there are differences of speed between So tra and Tantra, they are similar in that beginners need to enter gradually.

Reciting the letters without vowels is explained as referring to the Vajra recitation. As the Esoteric Accomplishment states: In the glorious [37lt] Community, The savior of beings taught very clearly Four things to be meditated, On the higher than highest path.

Misunderstanding the many texts such as the Enlightenment Songs (Dohas), which explain that, relying on a progression through such stages of the path in the context of meditating primarily the innate [orgasmic] wisdom, one ceases the elaborated meditations of the creation stage; it seems that [some] have [mistakenly] thought that the system of the Great Brahmin was sudden and the system of Nagarjuna was gradual. Never­theless, the interpretation that asserts two paths, a gradual one for dull and mediocre intellects in the stage of first entering in this path, and a sudden one for the extremely sharp intellects, is contradictory to the Tantra and to all authoritative treatises. But I have already extensively explained these interpretations in the Stages of the Path of Great Vajradhara.

And the meaning of this is explained by the Illumination of the Lamp, [includ­ing all stages of the path] from the meditation on the stage of wisdom to the end of the evolution triumph. The phrase from that very chapter: Again, one should perform serv ice With firm discipline, by means of the fo ur vajras ... indicates the creation stage; the Illumination of the Lamp explains that it refers to the summary creation stage. That is also explained as the mean­ing of the passage from the Further Ta ntra: First, voidness and enlightenment; Second, the concentration of the seed; Third, the completion of matter itself; Fourth, the establishment of the letter. When Naropa explains this as referring [to the path] from the meditation on the stage of wisdom up to the mandala triumph, he intends the exten­sive creation [stage] by means of the four vajras.

After that, one must supply the subtle [yoga] and recitation, and so on. [Chandrakirti] explains in the eleventh chapter of the Illumination of the Lamp the single-minded [focus] on the six clans, from meditating the wisdom stage up to the triply nested heroes. He states that one's mental process develops when practicing that in fo ur sessions; this has the same meaning as the concise performance.

Therefore, as for what some advocates of the Marpa system say-that the meditation on the wheel of the mandala is [only] necessary to accomplish the variety of ritual deeds; that, as the prerequisite of the perfection stage, it is sufficient to meditate on the wisdom body made by a mere instantaneous creation of the father­mother deity from within the realm of voidness; and that just that is what is indicated by \"abiding well on the creation stage\"41-this does not agree with any of the genuine treatises of the Noble tradition, and even contradicts their own [Marpa] system. As the Concise Five Stages Eluci­dation states: Who vividly realizes the forms Of this creation stage, the deity body And the supreme mandala of perfect buddhas, And learns it thoroughly, that one will be fulfilled. To assert that one must create a wisdom body preliminary to medi­tating the perfection stage disagrees with the Integrated Practices state­ment that the wisdom body is created from the magic body and there is no [actual] deity body from the creation stage up to the mind isolation. And especially the division into the mantra body and the wisdom body on the creation stage is a notion that has no place in this system. In short, by knowing just what sort of meditation on the creation stage serves to develop one's spiritual process to produce a complete re alization of the perfection stage, it is crucial to meditate something more than the mini­mal creation stage.

When learning that, one learns the yoga of imagination. When learning that, one abides in the beginner's samadhi. Here, the Integrated Practices Commentary's interpretation, that the single-mindedness [yoga] is the instantaneous learning of the creation stage and the imagination yoga is the learning through many moments, is incorrect; for the Illumination of the Lamp explains that the single­mindedness [samadhi] is the creation of Vairochana, and so on, from the five enlightenments. Again, some people, basing themselves on the Illumination of the Lamp's eleventh chapter explanation that the single-mindedness [samadhi] is the creation one by one of Vairochana, and so forth, interpret first the single-mindedness as learning a single deity; then, once one has learned that, [interpret] the learning of the yoga of imagination as learning the entire sadhana performance. This also is invalid, because in that expla­nation of the single-mindedness [samadhi] on Vairochana, and so on, [Chandrakirti] mentions the meditating on the mandala with holistic visualization. Therefore, the \"single\" in single-mindedness does not indicate either that the mindfulness of the deity is [achieved] all in one move, or that one is mindful of only one deity, but rather that either one is singly mindful of deities or one is mindful of oneself as one with the deity.

The samadhi of the beginner is the yoga of the first stage: \"to abide in that\" is to stabilize it or to perfect it.

The last two lines ask what is the detailed meaning of each one, E, VAM, and so on. Of these two questions, in answer to the latter, a verse is put fo rth explaining each syllable. And in answer to the fo rmer, three meanings of EVAM are stated: [1] The EVAM of the goal, fruition; [2] The EVAM of the path, the means of attainment; and [3] The EVAM which is the sign (linga) which brings about that [attainment].

In summary. concerning the position on the view of voidness, the great treatises write about four levels of superiority: all Universal Vehicle philosophers except the Dialecticist Centrists accept the personal self­lessness in agreement with its determination by the Scripturalists; the Experientialists accept voidness as [things being] devoid of substantial subject-object-dichotomy and as things being devoid of the intrinsically identifiable imaginative construction which is intrinsically ascriptive and descriptive designation; the Dogmaticist Centrists [accept the view of] voidness as the negation of the truth-status of all things without negating the conventionally intrinsically identifiable status [of things]; and the Dialecticists [accept] the view of realitylessness which negates all things' intrinsic identifiability in terms of both realities. Concerning these, the fourth is the view of voidness mentioned in the joining of bliss and void in terms of the jewel-like [46bl person who is the disciple of the Unexcelled Mantra Vehicle.

As for the meaning of that, [Anailgavajra's] Accomplishment Ascertaining Wisdom and Art explains: Knowing and known are distinguished, Joined they are analyzed thoroughly, And the realitylessness of things [discovered]; That very thing is pronounced \"wisdom.\" The compassion that extracts beings From the ocean of suffering and its causes, [49bl Is passionately attached to beings, And so is called a \"[loving] passion.\" Thus, wisdom ascertains realitylessness, investigating while distinguish­ing bodies and minds, and the universal passion, the art through which beings' aims are fu lfilled, is the orgasmic bliss explained as compassion [as the same text goes on to state]: Mixed like milk and water United nondualistically, The union of these two Is called \"wisdom art.\" Thus one should understand them according to this statement of their union as like the mixing of milk and water. Furthermore, as fo r the actual indivisibility of bliss and its [void] re ality, since the very establishment of [bliss's] substance establishes already its actuality as indivisible from its voidness, it is not necessary for the yogT/ni to make them experientially indivisible.

This is because it is not the case that voidness-realization and bliss [as initially separate entities] mutually [then] become one anothers' actualities. For example, although [virtues such as] generosity, etc., are combined with the view of selflessness, generosity, etc., do not arise as the actuality of such a view of thatness. If one wonders: \"Well then, how are they to be understood?\" [Here, when] that conscious subjectivity produced as the actuality of orgasmic bliss unerringly realizes the import of its objective voidness, its subject-object-union itself [already] is the union of bliss-void-indivisible. Further, at the time of the objective [clear light's] orgasmic [bliss-void­indivisibility], subject and object become experientially uniform, like water merging in milk, and even the subtlest [trace of] dualism ISOa] is terminated. Whereas before the arising of the objective orgasmic [bliss­void-indivisibility], experiential uniformity is only imagined, since one has not [yet] directly experienced thatness and must [gradually] enter [the experience of] thatness by means of a conceptually imaginative con­scious attitude. As such is the process of [the subjectivity] uniting non­dually with the objective voidness, the process of uniting in indivisible actuality [both the] bliss [mind] and the mind realizing voidness is the integrated creation of the undifferentiable actuality of the two minds. Since there is nothing [here] that exceeds the Centrist method of decisive realization of voidness, there are no grades of superiority between the voidness view of this vehicle and [that of] the Transcendence Vehicle. Though the object to be ascertained is the same, no other subjectivity has the same power to realize voidness as the orgasmic bliss subjectivity; so though the voidness is not different, the bliss art [that realizes it in the Vajr ayana] is declared to be distinctively superior. If one does not deter­mine selfless voidness with decisive insight, one is not liberated from the life cycle; and if one does not generate the orgasmic bliss as the means of ascertainment, one lacks the life-energy of the supreme path of Mantra: thus, since either one by itself is not enough, it is declared that both are necessary.

Thus, it is necessary to cultivate the certitude [about the void side] from the thorough determina­tion of the import of selflessness. [VI.B.3.b.ii.B '1 'a 'iii 'n\"-Rebutting objections] One might object: If meditating voidness is cultivation of the certi­tude of orgasmic bliss's ascertainment of the import of selflessness, then it contradicts the Samputa [Tantra]'s statement not to meditate holding either voidness or non-voidness: Don't meditate the void, And don' t meditate the non-void!

For, just prior to that quote [the Samputa Ta ntra] states the holding of inessentiality: The truth realm is extreme equality, To be realized as like a plantain tree ....

As he also says in the Wo rld-Transcending Praise: You have taught the elixir of voidness In order to eliminate all imaginations; Whoever becomes invested in that, You find utterly absurd.

Furthermore, the un­excelled Vaj ra Vehicle thoroughly ascertains that same thing in the same way by mobilizing the distinctive subjectivity of the orgasmic joy, and explains the measureless immediate and ultimate advantages of the bestowal of the supreme in this very life through the great bliss subjectiv­ity.

And in regard to the statements of the spirit of enlightenment in the second chapter of the Root Ta ntra, the Illumination of the Lamp mentions two spirits of enlightenment, which are those of the ultimate clear light and of ultimate communion. Of these two, the former is the objective orgasmic [intuition]; so it is not that [such orgasmic spirit of enlighten­ment] is not explained in the system which combines the bliss-void­indivisible voidness and the compassionate spirit of enlightenment.

So one should understand them as meaning the union of both bliss and void, and not mistakenly take them to be separable. Although the message of f53al bliss-void-indivisible is as widely re nowned as the wind, the understanding of the way of uniting the great bliss-specially distinctive among blisses-and the ultimate reality of voidness-specially distinctive among voidnesses-is extremely rare. With this in mind, Saraha said [in an Enlightenment Song]: Though the story is told from house to house, The locale of great bliss is not well understood.

There also are such teachings in terms of the import of communion in the Noble system.

The spirit of en­lightenment is also declared in the Community Further Ta ntra: Peace, beginningless and endless, Inexhaustible principle not substantial, not insubstantial. Voidness and compassion inseparable-That is called \"enlightenment spirit.\" Here I should explain the enlightenment spirits of the above explained two [53bJ communions. Here \"insubstantial\" refers to voidness and \"sub­stantial\" refers to compassion, and those two are referred to as wisdom and art. As the text continues: The insubstantial is wisdom, And art has the nature of the substantial. This is the context of explaining the import of the yoga of art and wisdom in equilibrium. And this is according to the Illumination of the Lamp's declaring the meaning of the statement of the equilibrium of art and wis­dom in the sixth section of [Chandrakirti's] Six-Branched Yo ga, that it is the communion uniting superficial reality art and ultimate re ality wisdom. In general there are many arts and wisdoms; but here the art and wisdom of communion is identified. Although [usually] actual ultimate reality is the uncompounded reality of things, here \"ultimate reality\" refers to the clear light wisdom which enters the single taste of that reality and great bliss, often stated to be [the ultimate reality] where sub­ject and object cannot be distinguished. Thus in this context, objective orgasmic wisdom has two types; one on the occasion of the objective clear light alone and another on the occasion of the clear light of com­munion. The first of these is the stage of clear light or the stage of clear enlightenment explained in the Five Stages as the fourth stage, and the second is one half of the fifth stage communion stage. l54aJ Thus, as for the mere objective orgasmic [intuition] of bliss-void-indivisible explained in other treatises, from among the two kinds of the ultimate explanation included in the four procedures lof explanation], it is the clear light ulti­mate-above that there is the communion ultimate, to which it still has not arrived."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"128 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp If such is the ultimate reality [clear light void] side, which is one part of communion, what is the other part, the superficial reality side,? This [Noble] system differs from other treatise's explanations of superficial reality.

At the end of the three voids of mind isola­tion there arises a superficial magic body made of the energy of fi ve light rays; and that is the [type of] magic body which is called the stage of self-consecration, the third of the fi ve stages. These will be extensively explained [below]. Therefore, the import of theE and VA syllables is the indivisible unification of the objective clear light and the purified magic body, according to the above explanations. And the import of the M-drop is the mode of union in a single actuality; as mind in the first type [of bliss­void communion] and as body in the second type [of ultimate-superficial communion].

In these [Noble] systems, the import explained as the four voids is the same as that explained in the Yogini Tantras and their elucidative commentaries as the four joys. [But]. while in this system the magic body is taught as made of neural energy and mind between the third and fourth voids, in the Yogini Tantra literature such is not explained as occurring between the third and fourth joys.

[VI.B.3.b.ii.B '1 'b 'ii 'A,-The proof through the perspective of its being the extraordinary cause of the [buddhas\"] material body] The Ornament of Realizations states: The spiritual conception is for the sake of others, Desiring the utterly perfect enlightenment. Thus, as for example one suffering from thirst mainly aims at getting [something to] drink but may [also] aim at [obtaining] a vessel as a means of getting it, so the [messianic] Universalists, while they mainly aim to fu lfill the interests of others, forced by their minds being moved by uni­versal compassion which cannot tolerate beings tormented by sufferings and bereft of happiness, they fu rther see that if they do not attain [the vessel of] buddhahood, there is no other method for them to achieve that fu lfillment of [others' needs]. So for one with such an ambition for perfect enlightenment as a method of that [fulfillment of others' needs], the two Universal Vehicles, of Mantra and of Transcendence, are similar; since they do not differ in their spiritual conceptions. Thus, since among the two buddha-bodies, that which accomplishes beings' needs through direct manifestation is the material body [55bl and not the truth body. the material body is the main objective. Thus, a dis­tinctive cause homogeneous with that art which is the means of attaining the material body-an unexcelled distinctive specialty lacking in other vehicles, other Tantras, and the fi rst stage [of Unexcelled Yoga]-is necessary in the context of the perfection stage. In that light, if there is no wisdom re alizing voidness, one cannot attain freedom of liberat ion from the bonds of the life cycle. Such wisdom also exists for the Individual Vehicle; but if the aspect of the art which causes the [buddhas'] material body is lacking, however much you meditate on voidness, you only attain freedom liberated fr om identity-bound existence, and do not attain omniscience.

However, in the Transcendence Univer­sal Vehicle, though there is meditation on a path conducive to the truth body, there is no meditation on the deity body, which is conducive to the material body. Here, as for the detailed explanations of such [topics] as the two vehicles' ranking in terms of their arts of [creating] the material body, the way in which the two paths conducive to the two bodies are the same in terms of requiring meditation, and the necessity to accept this in the path of all four Tantras, and so on, I will not elaborate them here, as I have already done so in the Stages of the Path of [Great] Vajradhara. Further, as for the deity yo gas of the three lower Tantras, compared to the Unexcelled Yoga Tantra, they are extremely remote [in their serv­ing] as causes of the [buddhas'] material body. [56a] And the deity yogas of the first stage of Unexcelled Yoga Tantra are merely the means of developing the roots of virtue that prepare for the realizations of the perfection stage. But the perfection stage deity yoga, so extremely dis­tinctive from those, must serve in general as the [main] cause of the material body, and particularly must be a cause homogeneous with the [32] signs and [80] marks which serve as the immediate cause of the material body, which is the fruition at the end of the learning path of the perfection stage. In this context, as for the Transcendence Vehicle cause of the material buddha-body, in general there are the many stores of merit, and in particular, through the causes of the physical signs- such as the escort­ing of mentors [being the evolutionary cause of the light-webbed fingers], and so on, one attains the stages in [the process of] accumulating these stores over many lifetimes. One [thus gradually] attains a body condu­cive to the fruitional signs and marks, further getting better and better on higher and higher stages, and at the time of the final existence, one will attain the ultimate signs and marks of the learning path of that [transcen­dence] path. Thereupon, at the time of buddhahood, the homogeneous preceding [causes] of the signs and marks of that body are taught to serve as the homogeneous causes of the fruitional signs and marks; and it is not claimed that there is any sudden transfor mation without attaining the prior body with signs and marks. Likewise, on the attainment of buddha­hood in a single l ifetim e through the path of the Unexcelled Yoga Tantra, it is not stated that one must achieve the body adorned with signs and marks just by achieving a body; if one does not attain a certain type of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"132 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp body adorned with signs and marks on the learning path, there will be no homogeneous cause, and there cannot be any sudden transformation.

One cannot create the body adorned with the signs and marks by meditating deity yoga with this gross evolutionary body. It is insufficient to use only the body meditated in the mind as the deity body, as in the occasion of the creation stage. One needs a distinctive deity yoga that attains the body adorned with signs and marks other than those [above meditational bodies]. And since no material cause of that other than the neural wind­energies is appropriate, the process of achieving the magic body from the wind-energies is definitely necessary.

Thus, the main thing is that [the creation stage] has the purpose of developing the paths of the perfection stage in correspondence to the processes of beings' birth and death. This procedure is clearly explained in the Com­munity literature. As the Vajra Rosary Ta ntra states : Just as there is no thing left after being burned by fire, So without cause, one goes on after dissolving. Again, when the energy of life arises, The various wind-energies of the body, Consciousness together [63aJ with them, Again abide in the triple world; From that there is action, and from that birth; And from that the instincts of lust, and so on; And from that again death and birth.

Again from the death clear light the energy of evolution arises, and it and consciousness together take birth and abide in the three worlds. From that evolutionary energy again the instinctual notions such as lust are produced, thereby accumulating good and bad evolutionary momen­tum, dying, being born again, and so going on like the turning of a wheel.

Thus at the end of the wind-energies having repeated [their move­ments] all day and night, the wind-energies' movement out and in stops, and the elements gradually dissolve. The experiences of luminance, radiance, and imminence arise, [63b] and it is the mind isolation stage. After imminence, the death clear light arises at the stage of clear light, which is called the \"natural clear light.\" At the end of the death clear light, the between body is developed separate from the old body from just the neural-wind-energy and mind abiding in the complex of the old aggregates; this being the magic body stage, it is called the \"natural beatific body.\" In the natural time, there are not two separate stages of the magic body, the impure and the pure; and yet I will explain below how this [natural sequence] can represent the two types of magic body of the path time. Now the natural between beatific body is not perceived as the object of the ordinary fleshly eye, but when it takes birth in the birth state it becomes the object of that eye, as the natural emanation body. In regard to th is pattern, the Five Stages states: That very magic is superficial re ality, And also the body of full beatitude, Its very self becomes the fairy being, And itself indeed the vajra body. Thus it explains the third stage magic body as the fairy being in the between, whereby you can understand both tendencies, to call the path magic body \"the between\" and to call the natural between the \"path magic body.\" Such expressions arise by reason of the fact that the very same wind-energy-mind which goes into the between for one who lacks the personal instruction in skill in liberative art arises as the magic body"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"144 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of full beatitude for one who has the personal instruction in liberative artistry.

By the key of both father and sons explaining thus about the be­tween, you will attain understanding about how-since death and birth are the spinning on the wheel of the life cycle as the impulsive birth and death of the person who lacks the personal instruction, and yet for one who has the personal instruction, what becomes death arises as the truth body and what becomes impulsive birth-taking arises as the emanation body-[authors] might indicate the natural processes with the names of the two path-time bodies, and indicate the two path-time bodies with the names of the two natural processes. In the Stage of Arrangement, it is clearly taught that, having understood both stages of the mind objective through abiding in the vajra recitation-as it is explained that one real­izes the clear light in the processes of death by means of the two [holistic and dissolving] contemplations-one must generate in one's process the perfection stage paths according to the processes of death.

Among these, there is the manual of the fi ve stages [falsely] attributed to the mentor Marpa called Lama's Speech Light Rays Teaching, which takes as authority the apparitional Nondual Triumph Tantra, and agrees with the interpretations of that Tantra alone. Since it seems to disagree with the verifiable instruc­tions of the Marpa tradition, it would not seem to have been authored by that mentor. Of the manuals written by Serdingpa, who witnessed the two traditions in the succession from Tsurton to Geypawa, the contents are in agreement with the explanations of the Concise Five Stages Elucidation of other lineages. Now the root word on th is precept of the Marpa tradition is the Concise Five Stages Elucidation, as above explained, and it appears that Serdingpa also re lied on that. In the writings of Serdingpa on the personal instruction of the Community, there are th ings from the Yogini Tantra such as the meditations of body-invasion, soul-ejection, and furor, which seem to have been put forth on some sort of a basis in the Concise Five Stages Elucidation.

As for my own interpretation, the Noble master did not mention the second stage body isolation, taken as the second part of a twofold body isolation, prior to the speech isolation, considering it contained within the varja recitation stage. Thus, the first two isolations can be contained within the mind objective stage and the perfection stage considered to have four stages overall.

Here you may wonder that, if both paths are arts for both accom­plishments, why were they mentioned separately as means of achieving common and supreme [accomplishments, respectively]? Since without regard to the perfection stage it leads to achievement of common accom­plishments, the creation stage is a means of achieving common accom­plishments, at the same time it is the means of developing the root of virtue needed to re alize the perfection stage. The perfection stage is the chief path for achieving the supreme, and so is mentioned as the means for achieving the supreme. Thus, as means of achievement, the two are not mutually exclusive. While retraction and contemplation are explained in terms of the perfection stage by other authoritative scholars, because that is the inten­tion of the Personal Instruction, it seems necessary to explain them also in terms of the creation stage; thus in general we should not interpret retraction and contemplation as wholly in either creation or perfection stages, but should accept both parts [of each of them]. In particular, we should interpret them according to the explanation in the context of whichever stage of the text is at hand. Thus, as according to the Noble tradition they are explained in their perfection stage context, I think it is good [so to interpret them in that context].

[VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3 'a 'ii 'B \"2\"-Analyzing the accuracy of Tibetan explana­tions] When we refute the claim of a certain Tibetan, [the scholar] Lan, that \"retraction\" refers to the conduct, the argument \"the normal order is contradicted if the conduct comes at the beginning of achieving the supreme\" can be applied equally well to our own position. Thus, it is incorrect for \"retraction\" and \"contemplation\" to refer to the magic body, because it is contradictory for the magic body to come at the beginning of achieving the supreme. By explaining \"at the beginning,\" we are saying \"it must not come at the beginning,\" and this is the same when used about the conduct. If we indicate the fault of contradicting the normal order, it applies the same way to either the six branches or the five stages, and it is very contradictory for a retraction and cont emplation [branch] magic body to develop before the life-energy-control vajra reci­tation, for there to be a mindfulness [branch] mind isolation after the endurance [branch] clear light, and for the [premature] arisal of the third stage magic body. Furthermore, since it is certain that there is a life­energy-control path in the five stages and that mind isolation and magic body arise developed in sequence, [76aJ in the Time Machine system also both the life-energy-control vajra recitation and the mindfulness mind isolation would have to come before the retraction and contemplation magic body, and one part of mindfulness would have to develop before endurance; because they are accepted as synonymous. Such faults are not properly explained as the same in meaning, so we should not insist on explaining them as the same. Likewise, we our­selves assert that the magic body is the eleventh stage, and clear light the twelfth, or the thirteenth [stage]. if we count from the stage of faith. and the twelfth stage is the stage of becoming noble. Such being the case, it seems contradictory [to claim] such views as that the noble stage eleventh stage magic body will be attained through retraction in the beginning of the achievement of the supreme, that the Time Machine samadhi branch"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"166 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp will be attained from the alienated individual' s stage, that it could be understood as communion and so fo rth.

Therefore, both \"self-consecration\" and \"superficial reality,\" as explained by the Noble father and sons and by the Time Machine literature , are nominally the same but diffe rent in meaning. For example, there are many [diffe ring interpretations of the two] such as when GhaiJtapada's [Supreme Bliss] Five Stages explains the self-consecration as the meditation on the drop in the heart center. As for how other Tibetans seem to take the position that the Time Machine way of reconciling the six yoga branches with the six stages has the same meaning, their p(,bl incorrectness can be understood from what has already been explained. Therefore , Naropa explained the texts on the six yogas of the Further Ta ntra according to the explanation of the Illumination of the Lamp, but in his Commentary on the Summary of Initiations, he explained according to the Time Machine. Thus even though such things are not properly explai ned as the same in meaning, it is good to investigate what is the equivalent, since if you do that, you will determine the practical instructions of each individual Tantra. To explain a little more, the Time Machine system's retraction and contemplation [branches] are the means of purifying the central channel preliminary to the life-energy-control branch's injection of the two [side channel] winds into that central channel. So even if you do not meditate according to how it is explained there , if [what you do meditate] seems to serve as a means of purification of the central channel to prepare for inserting the two winds there, it is the equivalent. Likewise, the Time Machine's life -energy-control [branch] is the means of inserting the winds into the central channel, and [its] endurance is the holding those inserted winds immobile in the hubs of the channel wheels; so even if you do not meditate life-energy control and endurance exactly as it is explained in that source, if [what you do meditate] seems a means to achieve that purpose, it is the equivalent of those two. Likewise, [the Time Machine's]"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Chapter III-Perfe ction Stage of this Ta ntra · 167 mindfulness is, by the art of meditating depending on the prior means, burning the furor-fire, melting the spirit of enlightenment, and experi­encing the joy of its falling to the tip of the secret place, and [its] samadhi is the changeless bliss of holding that enlightenment spirit with­out emission; so, even if you do not meditate exactly as explained from that source, if what you do serves as a path able to achieve that purpose, then it serves as the equivalent of those two. Therefore, from the perspec­tive of the ability to achieve a particular purpose, the five stages and so on can be matched with other paths and one can mutually reconcile the paths; (77uJ though you do not explain them as having the same meaning, the point of the context is accomplished, and you will attain fearlessness about where the keys of the paths of different Tantras fit. And such reasoning can also be understood to apply to other paths as well. So you should hold on to this exceptional way of analyzing of those of great genius. As for Lan' s interpretation of retraction as the conduct, though there is a mere similarity of definition, it does not work out since the Further Tantra mentions the conduct entirely apart from the six branches. There­fore, avoiding that, if you connect the six branches to the six stages of the perfection stage, it is better to follow Ekadashanirgho�ha and con­nect retraction and contemplation to body isolation. According to the Illumination of the Lamp explanation, there are three life-energy controls meditated on the three nose tips, so, though there is a life- energy control [practice] that is neither the actual speech isolation nor vajra recitation, those two are given the name as they are the chief kind of life-energy control; so [life-energy control] is included with those two, [speech isola­tion and vajra recitation. Mind isolation, except that it can be understood to be the one pointedness of contemplation and has similar characteristics with the three voids prior to entry into clear light, is not mentioned explicitly. Endurance is explained by the Illumination of the Lamp as the same in meaning as clear light, so it does not work out for it to indicate mind isolation and magic body. Mindfulness refers to the way of arisal of the luminances coming during the re-emergence from clear light. Samadhi is very clearly explained in the Illumination of the Lamp as communion, so there is no point in explaining it otherwise, as I will explain in detail below. The third stage magic body, except that it can be understood from its having similar characteristics to the communion magic body, 177hl is not mentioned verbally among the subjects explained by the commentaries"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"168 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of the texts on the six branches. And as for the fact that \"actuality of all buddhas\" does not refer to the magic body, I will explain it below. If I explain their meanings in detail, the magic body and the mind isolation will also be brought out, so there is no fault of not reconciling the im­portant things about the achievement of the supreme of the perfection stage with the path of the six branches. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3 'b' -Certification of their order] As for the statement in the Five Stages about the two stages being like the steps of a ladder, the fi ve stages of the perfection stage are similar; for it states that by abiding in vajra recitation, the mind objective will be attained, [then] the magic body will be purified by the reality limit clear light, and arising from that, nondual communion will be attained. And one can also understand thereby that by abiding in the mind objective the magic body will be attained. That is the order indi­cated, in that each later stage arises depending on each previous stage. This is not detailed in the Five Stages but is detailed in the Integrated Practices; where it states the order of the progress of the two spiritual conceptions, [including] the aspiration to the buddha-vehicle, the single­minded awareness of the coarse deity yoga, the subtle conceptual yoga, the training in each previous stage from body isolation to communion leading to the learning of each subsequent stage; and it also states the order of the re verse, how from body isolation on, if the former is lacking, the latter will not arise. So, from this one must accept the certainty about the progressive order. Except for just that explanation, the Root and Explanatory Tantras and the treatises of the Noble father and sons do not provide clearly the reason for the certainty of such an order. The Kashmiri Lak�hmi 178al explains [the process as] first the neces­sary purifying of the ordinary body, which is accomplished by the creation stage from the first beginning up until the body isolation of the hundred clans. Then the speech isolation purifies the speech, and the mind isola­tion purifies the ordinary mind. Then in order to bring to fruition one' s former vows, to abandon the nihilistic tendency gotten from the teaching of the god Mahe§hvara, to accomplish beings' aims until the end of the aeon and to abandon the cessation truth accepted as enlightenment by the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Chapter Ill-Perfe ction Stage of this Ta ntra · 169 disciples, one attains the magic body.64 Again. if one is attached even to that, one will become objectivity oriented. and one uses clear light to purify that. And finally, communion is taught in order to abandon any nihilistic extremism related to clear light. Previous Tibetan scholars have said that. just as a flute will not give a pleasant sound until its insides are cleansed, the speech isolation will not arise until the ordinary body is isolated by the body vajra samadhi, and it will arise in the opposite case. Just as, until the horse-like wind mounted by the mind is tamed, the rider-like mind will not be under control, so mind isolation will arise when speech isolation has brought the winds under control. In mind isolation, if even at the coarsest [level] one does not understand all things as merely self-aware mind, if at the subtlest one does not understand superficial reality as mere magical illu­sion, or if one has not [attained] the self-aware bliss samadhi in mind isolation, then the magic body will not arise; for the magic body is achieved from just those. For example, if the cognition cannot pick out a vase it cannot determine its property of impermanence. Likewise, without going to the limit of the subject of magical illusion, 178bJ one will not realize the clear light of [its] dissolution by the two [holistic and dissolv­ing] contemplations. If the invisible clear light is not first attained, one will not realize the communion of vision-void indivisible, just as before one's cognition can determine a mirror image as vision-void indivisible, one must have determined that a mirror reflection lacks the substance of the reflected object. A certain Marpa tradition scholar holds the same position as Lak�hmi on the first two, posits mind isolation as it is taught to include body and speech, posits magical illusion in order to abandon truth­insistence, posits clear light in order to abandon insistence on mere magical llusion, and posits the teaching of communion in order to aban­don nihilistic extremism. 64 This is a very interesting way of defining the role of the creative art of the magic body, as the special means for fulfilling the bodhisattva vow, and avoiding the temptation of escaping into the bliss of the clear light which is seen either as a tendency of the great Shiva or as a trap into which the Individual Vehicle adept might fall through attachment to a dualistic notion of the third noble truth."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"170 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp In regard to that, the first interpretation seems to say that the three isolations are the means of purifying the three doors [of body, speech, and mind], since from the coarse level there must be abandonment, con­sidering the certainty of the order of those three doors; that since there is nihilistic extremism in mind isolation, one achieves the magic body in order to abandon it; that clear light purifies any orientation of absolutist extremism toward that [magic body]; and that communion is taught to abandon any lingering nihilism in that [clear light]. [This system] does not contain the necessary indication of the exceptional way in which the former develops the latter among the three isolations. Its procedure of de­veloping an absolutist path to abandon nihilism, and then a nihilistic path to abandon absolutism is, like an elephant washing himself [with mud] , not truly appropriate . As in the Integrated Practices: If you lack understanding of the superficial reality, you cannot directly re alize the ultimate reality! [A ryadeva] te aches that you must understand and attain the magic body before you can experience the clear light, l79a l so he must show a reason for the position that magic body must be developed before clear light can be re alized-and how can \"one must enter clear light to abandon insis­tence on magical illusion\" count as a reason? Reasons must be shown in that manner for the order of mind isolation, magic body, clear light, and communion; showing them in other ways seems to miss the essential point. Furthermore, as for the statement that mind isolation is taught in order to understand the inclusion of body and speech into the mind, it shows the fault of not investigating carefully how the orientations of mind isolation are produced. [A ryadeva] states in the Integrated Practices that having understood properly the true import of the mind, one can engage in the achievement of the magic body, which does not mean that one could fa il to eliminate doubts about the truth habit concerning the mind while in the mind isolation and subsequently eliminate them by means of the magic body; for it is stated that one must thoroughly ascertain the import of voidness [long before ], even in the time of meditating the creation stage. The second interpretation is quite excellent in stating its reasons, in that speech isolation develops mind isolation by the power of its control­ling the winds, that mind isolation serves as fo undation of achieving the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Chapter Ill-Perfection Stage of this Ta ntra · 171 magic body, that the magic body must realize clear light, being immersed in it by the two contemplations, and that clear light must precede the achievement of the [magic-body-clear-light] complementary communion. But as for its statement of example and import of the Jute as the reason for the order of the first two isolations, it is insufficient, since it seems that the analogy between example and import remains to be established. As for our own system's reasons for making the order certain, I will explain them in the context of proving the certainty of the enumeration. (VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'c'- Certainty of their enumeration! The third [79bl has two parts: [i'] The actual meaning; and [ii'] How to reconcile other paths with this path. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'c 'i'-The actual meaning] The Integrated Practices explains as above the way of learning the path in stages. It states that after having attained communion there is no new learning of any stage of the path. The Five Stages also states: Dwelling in the communion samadhi, There is nothing at all further to learn. -that there are no stages of the path not included in these and that one must learn them [all in order]. Thus, since no other paths not included there are needed, a larger number is eliminated, and since without them one cannot [achieve the goal], a smaller number is eliminated. Therefore, we must accept the certainty of their enumeration. Even so, a clear reason for the certainty of the number [of the stages] is not explicitly stated in the two kinds of Tantras or by the father and sons. In this regard, Lak�hmi says that the three isolations isolate [from ordinariness] and so purify body, speech, and mind; the clear light iso­lates and so purifies superficial and ultimate realities; communion causes the attainment of vajradharahood where the two realities are one in taste; and there are no more things to learn after that-so six stages are not needed. And since by just this explained above our desired goal is achieved, and since there are not only four stages, the number of five stages is definite. Bhavyakirti is the same in regard to the first three. The self-conse­cration is in order to accomplish the aims of beings with the purified"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp three doors. Insistent adherence to that is abandoned by clear light, and any [temptation otl nihilism in that is abandoned by communion. There is nothing beyond that to learn, so there is no sixth stage, nor are there any less stages. since without those two the ai ms of fllllal self and other would not be accomplished. Another fo rmer Tibetan scholar determines a count of six stages in terms of suppressing the manifestations of obscurations and eradicating the seeds of them. He locates the three isolations in the suppression of the manifestations of addictions and conceptual notions: body isolation, as the support of the tranquility of bliss-void, and speech isolation, as controlling the winds and thus not allowing conceptual notions to arise, are the conditions and mind isolation is the actuality, since that bliss-void is developed in the mind process by depending on the consort. He further states that magical illusion is there to abandon, through its realization of objective voidness, the seeds of objectivity notions insisting on objects in the private process, that clear light is there to abandon, through its re ali­zation of the voidness of the mind, subjectivity notions insisting on the subjective mind, and that communion is there to abandon the seed of in­sistence on the difference of the two realities; and that there are no more things to be abandoned than these. The first two [of these interpretations], except for some differences of expression, seem the same in meaning; and I have already examined whether they are correct or not. They do not appear to claim that [the dif­ferent stages] are like the transcendent wisdom explanations of tranquility and insight as different in meditative mode while similar in orientation toward voidness, so I do not think their interpretations are satisfactory; since one can't make the paths of quiescence and insight different, and one cannot determine the latter three paths [of the perfection stage] as individual remedies for different notions. [80bJ Well then, one wonders, relying on what can one achieve the deter­mination of the number [of stages]? Relying on the ultimate thing to be achieved, [one can determine the number] by the procedure of \"because to achieve that, these are neces­sary, and it is not necessary not to include them here.\" Just to do that, we will explain further below the already explained fruit of communion, which unites the wisdom truth body and its support the extraordinary matter body.

Prior to that communion of the two realities. you must achieve each side of the pair individually; because, as [A ryadeva] says in the Integrated Practices that: without realizing ultimate reality, you cannot realize the stage of communion ... and it is stated that you cannot realize clear light without having previ­ously attained the superficial magic body. Therefore, first you must create the magic body as the support for the direct realization of clear light, the reason for which will be explained. The third stage, magic body, and the fourth stage, clear light, no longer exist at the time of communion, and so are not the two parts of the time of communion. Yet in general, superficial magic body and ultimate clear light become the parts of communion; and so the two former things are explained thinking of their becoming those two [parts of communion]. As for the wind-energy and the mind which serve as the basis from which such a magic body is achieved, LMia] they are the mind created as the three wisdoms of the mind isolation and the wind-energies serving as their mount, arising from the dissolving process of the wind-energies collecting in the heart center by the process of earth dissolving into water, and so forth, and of the wind-energies that move the eighty natural in­stincts themselves dissolving and so forth; therefore you must attain mind isolation before the magic body. By such arts, to achieve the distinctive process of compression in the heart center, you must have the two meditations of the outer life-energy control uniting with the evolutionary and wisdom consorts and the inner life-energy control meditating on the wind-energies and drops and so on; therefore, before mind isolation you must achieve the process of speech isolation vajra recitation. \"Speech isolation\" and \"vajra recitation\" are designated by the name of one side of life-energy control, but the general name of this stage is mentioned in the Further Ta ntra as the \"life-energy control\" that is third of the six branches. It has three life-energy controls which meditate the substance drop at the lower nose tip, the indestruc­tible mantra drop at the heart center nose tip, and the light drop at the facial nose tip. While it teaches the union with the two consorts by"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"17 4 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp meditating the substantial drop outside the two lower nose tips of the art and wisdom, there are two occasions of life-energy control of union with the two consorts, one performed before the consummation of vajra reci­tation and one after such consummation. The chief re ason for the necessity of the energy mind arisen from the wind-energies gathering and dissolving in the heart center dhati chan­nel as the basis for the achievement of the magic body, has already been explained. I will explain below the detailed re asons for that and the pro­cedure by which the two consorts become the means for compressing the wind-energies in the heart center. Thus, before achieving the path of life­energy control which is a distinctive procedure of collecting the wind­energies in the heart center, [!ll hl you must meditate aiming your visuali­zation at other key points of the body. And so you must meditate the body isolation which meditates the development of orgasmic bliss arising from the general injection and dissolution of the two wind-energies in the dhati channel, which views all that arises as the play of that [bliss], and meditates all of that in the form of divinity. As there is no certainty of specific channels and wheels in terms of the other key points of such a body, here you fo cus your meditation on the drop in the lower door. As for the development of the roots of virtue underlying the gen­eration in your mental process of such a complete perfection stage, you must first meditate the single-mindedness of the coarse yoga of the first stage that cleanses the mind process through conversion of birth, death, and between into the three bodies and the fo ur session yoga that constructs the subtle mandala. And as for achieving fitness as a vessel of meditating the two stages, you must attain complete and pure initiations, and must maintain carefully the undertaken vows and commitments. And in order to become fu lly qualified as a vessel of maintaining the initiations and commitments, you must, as I have previously explained, cultivate the common path stages to cleanse your two spirits of enlightenment and their accessories. And as for the conducts that heighten the impact [of the practices], as they are taught by the example of the outer life-energy con­trol, such is the ascertainment of the number of all paths, of the two stages, and of the stages of the two stages. Thereby, you can know the ascertainment of their order as well. A single person needs all of those to become enlightened, and so Lak!;ihmT.

The Moonlight Commentary is not correct when it ex­plains that the best person needs the last two stages, the medium person needs the third and fourth stages, the inferior person needs the creation stage and vajra recitation, and the most inferior needs those two and verbal recitation, asserting that others' system is that \"best, medium, and inferior\" are posited in the context of one mental process gradually progressing from higher to higher and that its own system is that this intends different personal processes; since this [interpretation] contra­dicts the Noble father and son treatises' indications of order and also the Rosary of Complete Yo ga. This ascertainment of the number [of the stages], if you apply it to other Tantras, the last three stages should be interpreted as above. Since the heart center compression processes exist openly in such texts as the Supreme Bliss Five Stages [by GhaQ.tapada] and Kukuripa's [Heruka Sadhana] instruction [based] on the Mahamaya [Tantra], it is easy to understand the way of focus on it. Without that [heart center compres­sion], you should understand the procedure of finally focusing on com­pression in the heart center even on the paths of penetrating the vital points in the navel and so on. And, you should understand what is explained here as the reason how elsewhere even when the name \"body isolation\" is absent, if its referent is present, it is the same, and if its referent is absent it need not be contradictory, as a part of understanding the easy compression in the heart center. And you should supply the same principle also to the creation stage. As for the common path, it is similar in all [these principles of progression].

Further, you must understand how, while it is according to the interpretation of purposes from mind isolation up to communion, the chief art of developing mind isolation is the process of compression in the heart center, and how, even if the heart center com­pression process is not explicitly clear, compressions in other places such as the navel end up fo cusing on the heart center. But I have not written more than this little bit [on this], fe aring prolixity.

Then again, on the strength of the Integrated Practices statements: As for the just explained aggregates, elements, and media, one isolates the body; one sets a deity there , common to all, since it is a coarse yoga ... and just after that in the text: ... speech isolation is not creation stage, because it is extre mely subtle ..."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Chapter JV-Body Isolation· 181 -[here,] \"common to all\" indicates [body isolation] to be common to both stages; depending on which it is interpreted as having parts belong­ing to each stage.

Though others do not explain clearly, when other visualized deities are set in the body, they must be imagined as indivisible from the aggregates and so forth [8Sa], so it seems that they interpret those [practices] as body isola­tion.

It is very incor­rect to not include body isolation within the three samadhis mentioned in the Condensed [Sadhana] and to locate it on a diffe rent creation stage: because f85bl the three samadhis of the Condensed [Sadhana] indicate all the creation stages needed as preliminaries of the perfection stage, except for some creation stages [implemented] on the occasions of conducting ritual activities; because you cannot posit that \"this is the way of learning the arisal of deity forms of the previously unexperienced body isolation creation stage, after completing both subtle and coarse creation stages of the Condensed [Sadhana]\" ; and because there do not appear [in those creation stages] any ways of meditating the body isolation other than meditating the fo rms of deity bodies. It is incorrect to posit the whole of body isolation as perfection stage: because it is stated that \"body isolation is common to all\"; because speech isolation is specially picked out and stated \" not to be in the province of creation stage [practice]\"; and because you can understand [it is so] from the statement that coarse and subtle are the means of achieving the com­mon and the distinctive. Therefore, as \"establishing the deities\" refers to the establishing of deities as the aggregates and so forth, which is common to both stages, you cannot explain that the body isolation is never said to be common [to both stages], and you should divide body isolation into two body isolations belonging to the two stages. Such being the case, you should not interpret this according to the view of Damtsig Dorjey, since the Integrated Practices states that all body isolations, fr om the hundred-clan body isolation to the three-clan body isolation, are included in the one-clan body isolation, and it is improper for that included to be of the creation stage and that which includes to be of the perfection stage. As this meditation of aggregates and so on as deities of body isola­tion is a meditation of the arisal of the deity fo rm, and, since it is taught that [86uJ you meditate this after having fo und extreme stability of the vivid vision of the complete habitat and inhabitant mandalas within a mere mustard seed, you could not gain the experience of this without having already experienced the preceding, it would be incorrect to explain in some other way this stage of the path, [which must be] learned after"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation· 183 having learned that [preceding stage]. Though there is no clear explanation in the context of the first stage concerning this division of each aggregate and so on into five, when you complete the coarse and subtle creation stages, you aim your mind at whatever arises and you can immediately generate stable vivid vision of the arisal of the deity, and you cannot say you cannot generate the division into fields; therefore, Lan does not seem to be correct in his way of differentiating the body isolations of the two stages. Some scholars say that while the creation stage is the new creation [of a deity], the body isolation meditation of aggregates and so on as deities is the method of deity meditation of the perfection stage, which sees the deities as if primordially established. This seems to be an account based on failing to differentiate clearly between the two procedures of mantra body and wisdom body, [both used] on both stages. Just as, on the occa­sion of the perfection stage, drops and syllables and so on are indeed visualized in mind without existing as they are visualized, since they can create the nonartificial perfection stage without having to develop into other homogeneous visualizations, they are included in the perfection stage [in spite of involving conceptualization]. So you cannot achieve such [a nonartificial perfection stage] just by thinking \"aggregates and so on are deities primordially,\" and such a method of deity meditation [as the perfection stage body isolation] seems greater than the creation stage with its method of mental imagination and artifice; so you cannot differ­entiate the two stages just by [equating them with] those two [86b l ways of viewing deities. Similarly, even though the objectification of the mind which realizes voidness can be taken as the arisal of a deity, it cannot thereby be distin­guished from the creation stage; because that occurs even on the occasion of the creation stage; and because, while it is stated that one should purify [reality] in voidness by the [mantras] \"shanyata ... ,\" and so on, before creating a deity, it is improper to interpret its meaning as merely the retraction from perception without any proper understanding of the view of voidness. (VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd'i' A\"l \"c\"-Setting forth our own interpretation! Well, then what is the way to differentiate body isolations in terms of the two stages?"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"184 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp In regard to this body isolation which meditates aggregates and so on as deities, there are two ways of meditating it; one where the objec­tivity aspect [involved] in the realization of voidness arises as a deity, and one where it does not. When it does arise [as a deity], it has two varieties; one where it is a distinctive bliss that is realizing voidness, and one where it is not. And when it is the distinctive bliss that is realizing voidness, there are again two kinds; one where it is the bliss arisen from the rasantl and /a/ana wind-energ ies penetrating and dissolving into the dhuti chan­nel, and one where it is not [the bliss] thus arisen. Of those, on the creation stage there are body isolations where void­ness is realized in the second ways of the first two alternatives-voidness being realized without being realized by that bliss of melting, and where the aggregates and so forth are meditated as deities through the second ways of the last two alternatives. The body isolation that meditates the aggregates and so forth as deities through the first ways of the latter two alternatives is posited as being the perfection stage itself. 65 The creation stage body isolation wherein aggregates and so on are meditated as deities is said to consist of the occasions of the visualization of one's own body mandala and the mandala retraction, and of the viewing of all objective appearances as Vajradhara; and this is indicated by the statement about how the creation stage employs the pure art and wisdom which views the five sense spheres as male and fe male deities. Therefore, [87aJ learning such a body isolation occurs on the same occasion as learning the creation stage. As for the statement that, \"after having already learned the begin­ner's samadhi, one learns the body isolation, \" it refers to the perfection stage body isolation. 65 This rather brilliant analysis deserves a schema: Body isolation which meditates aggregates as deities a) Seeing voidness as a deity i) Seeing the void-deity through bliss x) Central channel bliss y) Non-central channel bliss ii) Seeing the void-deity without involving bliss b) Not seeing voidness as a deity Creation stage body isolation (bold)= b, a-ii, a-i-y.

This way of differentiating shows distinctiveness while allowing overlap."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation · 185 Well then, if you wonder, \"where is it taught that the body isolation meditates the aggregates and so on as deities from the perspective of great bliss?\" It is taught by the Integrated Practices' quote, in the context of meditating the five clan body isolation, from the Equal to Space Ta ntra: All this living world has the nature of five buddhas, Appearing like actors or like lovely paintings; Wherein \"great bliss\" itself alone, Alone performs through many moods. Here just as a single actor performs using different masks and costumes and a single color such as blue arises in many forms of color, so the single great bliss itself is stated to perform in many kinds of aesthetic mood. This is not to be understood as referring to such a performance by Buddha Vajradhara alone, but is used in terms of all great blisses of path and frui­tion times. Thus in the occasion of body isolation, great bliss alone is medi­tated as arising in the manifold play of the five clans and so forth, and that is not in terms of visualizing the bliss of other beings without having that bliss in one's own continuum, but is so meditated having generated that bliss in one's own spiritual continuum. Therefore, in that context, the Integrated Practices states [quoting the Magic S upreme Bliss Ta ntra]: The yoga will not arise From a cast statue and so forth, But striving in the spirit of enlightenment, [87bl The yogYniwill become a deity. Oneself the nature of all buddhas! Oneself the nature of all heroes! Thus one joins the divine, And thereby should realizes one's nature. Thus one should not just visualize the form of an external deity but should establish oneself in unity with the deity through striving in the spirit of enlightenment; the \"spirit of enlightenment\" quoted [here] in the Magic Supreme Bliss [Tantra] is the bliss-void-indivisible spirit of enlighten­ment."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"I 86 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp The Hevajra Ta ntra also states: And also: Definitely the purity of all things is called \"suchness\"; Then distinguishing each one, one should call them deities. Oneself self-aware is purity, not freed by another purity, Objective things being pure, self-knowing, bliss supreme. Thus, three purities are stated: a general purity called \"suchness purity,\" when you determine all outer and inner things to be void of intrinsic reality status; a purity of individual deities from meditating the matter aggregate and so on as deities; and a purity of natural awareness, the supreme bliss of each yogiini's natural awareness. The middle of these is said by the same text: In the realm of the creation stage, This should purify the aggregates. -that the purity of individual deities, lacking the great bliss deity medi­tation, is in the creation stage. Therefore, great bliss is the purity of the perfection process, and the suchness purity is common to both stages. Therefore, if you do not know the above explained way of deity meditation of perfection stage body isolation, since in this context you will lack the way of deity meditation that creates the wisdom body [88a), though you posit it as perfection stage, it will show no difference from the way of creating the mantra body deity, and you have not understood the vital point of this. We ll then, one wonders, if this kind of great bliss is not posited on the creation stage, and its art of creation does not appear until the creation stage is perfected and body isolation arrived at, and moreover if even in the context of body isolation the way of producing this does not appear, how does great bliss emerge in this context? By the reason that this seems to be one of the greatly difficult points, very hard to sort out, I will explain it in the context of the sequence [of the stages]."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation · 187 (VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd TA\"2\"-Sequence of creation stage and distinctive body isolation I How do you ascertain the sequence of the creation stage and the perfection stage body isolation? Generally, as for the complete meditation of the coarse and subtle creation stages, it is the means of developing the root of virtue that pro­duces all the perfection stages, so it also serves as the means of developing the arisal of the perfection stage body isolation. In particular, the medita­tion of the subtle [symbolic] implement or drop within the jewel is the method of collecting the rasanli and lala na wind-energies into the dhuti channel. Depending on that, when you develop the above-explained great bliss, it becomes the meditation of the actual body isolation, and that is how it is connected with the subtle creation stage. One wonders here, \"from what does one know that the meditation of the subtle at the lower door becomes the art of collecting the two wind­energies into the dhuti channel?\" Although life-energy control is taught in both the Action and Per­formance Tantras, it has previously been explained how these cannot col­lect the two wind-energies into the dhuti channel. As for the meditation of life-energy control taught in the Unexcelled [Yoga Tantras], \"life­energy\" means the rasanti and lalanti wind-energies and \"control\" means their insertion into the dhuti channel, having blocked their movement in the rasanti and lalana [channels] [88bJ. Much has been said about this in the Time Machine literature. Though the Illumination of the Lamp does not so explain the meaning of \"life-energy\" and \"control,\" it is similar [there] since the meditation of life-energy control accomplishes that very task. Therefore, the Persona/Instruction [of Mafijushrl ], commenting on the meaning of the Further Ta ntra statement that the meditation of the subtle at the secret nose tip is life-energy control, states: In the way of the strong-hearted, The drop falls from the heart lotus, And abides in the center Of one's vajra jewel; Supreme form of five elements, Reality of five wisdoms, Visualized as the subtle sign of one's divine self, Ablaze with the five light rays."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"188 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp That is stated more concisely as \"stopping the breath is the branch of voidness,\" saying that this is the branch of creating the void by stop­ping the expanding and contracting of the breath exhaling and inhaling from the nostrils, showing that the life-energy control branch and the breath-stopping branch are the same in meaning. Tathagatavajra also states [in his Art of Achievement (L iiyipa 's Sadhana) Commentary Auto­commentary]: Having caused the life-energy wind with its nature of the fi ve elements to move downward, by the way of enfold­ing it into a drop of spirit of enlightenment the mere size of a mustard seed, having it descend to the nose tip of the vajra, you should visualize with the previously explained process of retraction and the fi ve branched contempla­tion. This is the drop yoga; for the sake of reversing the outward flow of life-energy [winds], because of that very reason, the Esoteric Community Further Ta ntra cal led this \"life-energy control.\" And this again is merely an illustration; the yoga of subtle ali and kali [letters] at the navel, or the contemplation of the yoga of drops and so on at the heart and so on [89aJ, whatever works toward blocking the emission of life-energy is called \"life-energy control.\" Especially, on the strength of such contempla­tion as this, the control of the life-energy winds moves intensely into the central channel, having reversed their flow in the rasanii and lalanii channels; and this again is called \"life-energy control.\" Thus the Further Ta ntra states that \"life-energy control\" is the meditation on the subtle [drop] of the lower door, as it blocks the inhala­tion and exhalation flowing in the nostril from the rasana and lalantl and injects them into the central channel. And that is merely a partial exam­ple. For this extremely clear explanation that life-energy control is what accomplishes that fu nction, by meditating the visualization of drops and letters and so on at the navel and heart and so on, must be understood as applying to all statements about meditating the perfection stages which place letters and so on in whatever channel wheels there are.

Some of the Indian treatises on the six yoga branches of the Jfiana­pada tradition also explain in this same way. The Sheaf of Instructions says there is an eight petalled channel wheel inside the jewel, and the Initiation Summary mentions \"the lotus of the jewel\" intending that. Thus, meditating the subtle [drop] therein, one can withdraw the wind­energies into the dhati channel. The [Vajra] Rosary statement \"by seeing the place within the jewel\" resembles the statement about changing [this place] into the lotus in a woman; one must understand [the statement in this context] as referring to that support, [the channel wheel in the jewel, or in the lotus]. 66 In the Noble system, it is said that first you become stable by meditating the subtle in the jewel [89bl and [then] you can meditate the mandala within the expansion into the lotus of the mother. Thus, except for those of the type who can easily collect the wind-energi es, even if you stably meditate the mandala of the subtle of the creation stage it is hard for the two wind-energies to dissolve into the dhati channel, so usually when you enter the body isolation having stabilized the subtle mandala, and you meditate the subtle drop or implement in the jewel, only after having injected the two wind-energies into the dhuti channel should you meditate the actuality of the body isolation, the union of bliss­void and so on. As for the Further Ta ntra explanation of life-energy control which meditates the drop in the heart center and the lower door, its meaning explained by the Personal Instruction as a branch of stopping the breath is clearly elucidated by the two Indian treatises, especially explaining that all meditations of letters and drops in the places of the channel wheels serve as methods for compressing the wind-energies into the dhati channel. This is a marvelously eloquent detailed explanation of life-energy control. If you do not understand this, as your [understanding of] life-energy control will be too narrow, you will not understand the need to employ 66 I am uncertain about this; it refers to the need to be in a controlled sexual union posture with a consort to bring the drop into this position, and both partners in the union must be able to focus in this way, in the jewel for a male and in the lotus for a fe male."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"190 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp the life-energy control of the six branches in many of the Unexcelled [Yoga] perfection stages.

Thus it seems that the great certainty about the ultimate points of the instruction will not arise. But if you understand this pattern, it seems that it can develop the won­drous certainty about the vital key points of the private instructions about all of these [practices] [90aJ. If you still do not know properly the way of meditating the perfec­tion stage body isolation of this system, the problems lies in failing to know the way in which subtle drop meditation serves as the life-energy control which collects the two wind-energies and the way in which that develops the great bliss. Relying on the wisdom consort, having completed the subtle and coarse creation stage, you can bring your enlightenment spirit down from your crown to the tip of your secret place. You can stop it there with the PHAT letter, with extremely stable visualization, and relying on that you can generate the fo ur joys. But that cannot be posited as the perfection stage great bliss, since it does not arise from the dissolv­ing of the two wind-energies into the dhati channel. Therefore, even the meditation on the aggregates and so on as deities from the perspective of uniting voidness and such a bliss [of fo ur joys derived from visualization of the wisdom consort without dissolving the wind-energies] is not accepted as perfection stage body isolation.

Well, then, how should we interpret the intention of the Integrated Practices? You posit a body isolation only after having identified the body which is to be isolated, [9laJ and the verbal meaning of \"body\" is \"heap,\" \"pile,\" and \"mass.\" Thus, the first [Integrated Practices statement] shows it to be the mass of \"the measure of the flesh element and so on,\" as that is the way of \"piling\" up many things such as rice and barley and so on, and among those three; and this statement is also made in the Vajra Rosary. Then, as for the way of piling up shown in piling up the twenty­five [elements], such as the five aggregates, as one calls it a \"pile\" when many grains of rice or barley are piled up, he shows it to be a pile, a mass including the body's limbs and members. Among the twenty-five the mind and mental functions are also included, and the way they are piled up is different from the way grains of rice and so on, spatial objects each occupying its individual spatial location. So, [A ryadeva] mentions that \"because of the meeting of the elements\" in order to differentiate the [two ways of piling up]. Because the eyes and so on, the faculties, and the objects such as form meet one another, the mentality and the sixfold assemblage of the mind and wisdom and so on, the mental functions, occur. And as for their way of accumulating, assembling, and piling up, it is through collecting many parts of an uninterrupted continuum of former and later moments. So he says it is not a collecting of many spatial ob­jects each occupying its location at the same time, since he specifies that \"accumulation\" refers to continua.

These descriptions concern the fruitional stage of the wisdoms. The [Stage of] Arrangement describes them-intending to accord with the explanation of the process of the dissolution of the four wisdoms -as the clear appearance of objects like clear reflections in a mirror, as the equality of class unity among the three sensations, as the individual remembrance of the individual names of beings such as father and mother, and as the mindfulness of mundane activities and necessities. These are the first four, and the fifth is the actuality of the mental sense, ready to be transformed upon abandonment of the taints. Here, the Integrated Practices explains: The samadhi of Mafijushrihas already been explained ... thinking that, after explaining also the five, Rupavajraand so forth, he explains the five wisdoms. So, to take the explanation of Mafijushri as incidental, then to additionally explain the five wisdoms would be incor­rect: because [the hundred clans] is [reached by] making each deity into five clans, leaving out of the thirty-two deities the ten terrifies and Sam­antabhadra and Maitreya; r94a] and because the five wisdoms counted as five clans of the hundred clans are collected in the mental consciousness; and because, even in the context of the sense-media, though those sense­media are not openly there, many occasions of placing them in the clans of those contexts are [elsewhere] evident.

If the sound Shabdavajra, associated with the hearing of sounds through the permoving energy operating through the ear, is analyzed; there are sounds inside ear, head, and hair; sounds of songs and continuous sounds of palate and lips and speech; musical sounds of clay drum and so on; sounds of forest, streams, and palms clapping; and sounds of the mild and fierce HOM letter. These are the clans of the five, Shabdavajra­Vairochana and so forth.

These are the five clans of Gandhavajra-Vairochana and so forth. If the taste experience Rasavajra, associated with the tasting of tastes based on the surmoving energy operating through the tongue, is analyzed; there are sweet, astringent, salty, hot and sour, and bitter tastes; these are the clans of Rasavajra-Vairochana and so forth. If the texture experience Sparshavajra, associated with the experi­ence of textures based on the ultramoving energy operating through the body-sense, is analyzed; there are textures from staying in one seat, em­brace, sucking, kissing, and sexual union. These are the fi ve clans of Sparshavajra-Vairochana and so forth. As for the way in which those deities, thus taken as five for the twenty [above] arise as deities, if we use Vairochana as an example, the fi ve [Ropavajra-Vairochana and so forth] are similar to Vairochana in number of faces and arms and implements, and yet become five by differ­ing in colors ; by this the others can be understood. If one wonders, \"Well, having explained twenty out of thirty-two, why not elucidate the other twelve?\" The Root Ta ntra clearly explains the contemplation of each of the twenty from matter aggregate to texture as a deity, while the ten limbs, the joints, and the muscles and channels are not clearly explained to be meditated as the ten terrifies and the two bodhisattvas. Therefore, the Integrated Practices explanation was given in the same terms; because [Aryadeva] stated that, \"If each of the four sets is completed, it explains"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation· 199 the meaning of this summary in the Root Ta ntra.\" The Integrated Prac­tices quotes the Moon E.mteric Drop as the textual source of such a hundred clan [teaching], or its derivatives. the five clan practice. or the three clan practice.

The Explanatory Ta ntra Vaj ra Rosary also teaches the hundred clans. Again in that Tantra. in the context of the body isolation explained in the hidden meaning manner in the preface, the ten limbs are explained as the ten terrifies: and in the actual explanation of eye Kshitigarbha and so forth. Maitreya and Samantabhadra are also picked out, so that all thirty-two deities are completely accounted for: because it is stated [in that way] in the context of meditating the body as a deity in other sections [of the text]; because there is no difference on making each of the twenty deities suitable for analysis into five clans, while leaving the others un­suitable; and because they are equally used or not used in the body isola­tion [practice]. Therefore, even though one is concerned lest the hundred clans become too numerous if one applied the above explanation of the ten ter­rifies to the body isolation, it would not be correct to omit the complete explanation of the thirty-two deities, by not seeing how to arrange the passion-practice -concealing explanation, which had previously included them. Therefore all should be included in the section of the body isola­tion. You practice your body isolation using those twenty and, since you rely on the deities of the five clans dividing out into the hundred parts, it is stated that \"your own body becomes realized as made with the subtle atoms of all transcendent buddhas.\" Here \"subtle atoms\" is a name of having divided [the body] into a hundred separate parts and realizing them as a hundred deities."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"200 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTA\"4\"b\"-Body isolation of the thatness fi ve clans] If one [can] compress those classifications among the holy hundred clans, they can be compressed into fi ve clans.

Likewise, the twenty Ratnasambhava clans are water, the twenty Amitabha clans are fire, the twenty Amoghasiddhi clans are wind-energy, and the twenty Ak�hobhya clans are included in the consciousness realm. Here the Integrated Practices explains the matter aggregate and so on as derivati ve elements. Now, the matter aggregate, except for the four elements and the form in the objective sense-medium, does consist of actual derivative elements, and the four nominal aggregates are also desig­nated as derivative elements as they just depend on the elemental body.

[VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTA\"5\"-How it serves as retraction and contempla­tion branches (of the six yoga branches)] The fifth has two parts: [a\"] How retraction is contained within body isolation; [b'1 How contemplation is contained within body isolation. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3 'dTA\"5\"a\"-How retraction is contained within body isolation] In regard to \"retraction,\" the Further Ta ntra states: \"Retraction\" occurs, When desires concerning All of the ten faculties' natural functions And habituation to them are withdrawn. Generally, \"desires\" can mean both \"the desirer\" and \"the desired\"; here is it the latter, which is desired and craved, namely the five sense objects, matter, and so on. Toward them, the sense faculties withdraw again and again from each [object], and by taking each one by one, [the process] is called \"retraction.\" Designating the objects also with the word \"sense faculty,\" they are explained as the ten sense faculties. \"Natural function\" is the natural action of the five sense organs, eye, and so on, as appre­hender, and form, and so on, as apprehended. \"Habituation to them\" is natural habitual action. \"All\" means habituated to lesser, greater, and medium differences. \"Concerning\" means the dative [or locative] case. The sense faculties function for all those. The Chag translation says \"of the ten sense faculties,\" J96bl and in the commentary there is no meaning of again and again. The semantic equivalent for [the Tibetan] \"so so\" is [Sanskrit] \"prati.\" In the context of relativity, in the Lucid Exposition, it is explained as meaning \"to meet\" or \"to repeat.\" The meaning of pratimok,\\·ha as a"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"202 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp semantic equivalent for so sor thar pa is explained in the [Abhidharma} ko$ha as \"primary liberation.\" The meaning of prattchha is explained as \"specific acceptance.\" Here , the meaning of \"repeat\" is to \"repeat again and again, and memorize.\" Further, in the context of the expression \"I will repeatedly memorize firmly\" other commentaries likewise explain it in the sense of \"again and again.\" Therefore, it is not necessary to mention each and every different sense of \"so so.\" Here , we are not postulating the explanation in the Extreme Illumination of the Lamp: \"It fu nctions in each-matter, and so on,\" and \"It is withdrawn from the respective [ob­jects]-form, and so on.\" There are also many meanings for \"withdraw,\" but here they have the sense of \"retract\" and \"collected retraction.\" Gath­ered things are said to be the five objects of desires, so the sense faculties enjoy five objects. Furthermore , completing common familiarization practice-the four vajras, the sense faculties of the yogi/ni who enters the supreme familiarization practice do indeed enjoy objects, but just this alone is not the path of \"retraction\" meditation, because that must be posited as for the mental consciousness itself alone. Therefore, in the Illumination of the Lamp Fifteenth Chapter it is stated, [quoting the Root Ta ntra]: \"Eat the vow of excrement and urine!\" Here, 'Excre­ment' means the sense objects, form, and so on. 'Urine' means the sense organs, eye, and so on. The 'vow' of those is the coming together of the object and subject. 'Eating' that is the gradual experience of the stages of retraction [97al and so on. Thus [Chandrakirti] says that the sense faculties enjoying the sense objects is what is to be eaten, and \"retraction\" is the process of eating. Therefore, as above explained, the expression \"retraction\" is used for some special methods of enjoyment of sense objects by a yogi/ni's sense faculties, but the \"retraction\" member of the six-branched yoga is, when the sense faculties are enjoying the sense objects, the yoga of enjoyment that is sealed by the bliss-void great bliss of meditatively entranced body isolation. Thus, \"retraction\" is body isolation as an aftermath practice. Well, someone might ask, \"What is the meaning of the statement in the Extreme Illumination of the Lamp which teaches the second branch [contemplation] for the purpose of purifying retraction?\""},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation· 203 Even though retraction and contemplation are similar in taking the senses' enjoyment of desire objects as the path. the meaning [of the above statement] is that in retraction there is no enjoyment through realizing those [senses and objects] as deities as there is in the contemplation [branch]. Further, that being the case, there is no fault of them not coun­ting as body isolation, because great bliss itself is the definitive meaning deity, and meditating as sealed by that [great bliss 1 is the great art which isolates one from notions of ordinariness. IVI.8.3.b.ii.c'3 'd T A \"S\"b,.-How contemplation is contained within body isolation] In the Further Ta ntra it is explained that: In sum, the five desired [sense-objects] Are connected to the five buddhas; By this they are discerned and contemplated, That contemplation becoming five-fold: [A process of] examining, analyzing, being joyful, Having the great bliss of suchness, And actualizing one-pointed mind­Contemplation is comprised of these five.

The actuality of all buddhas is peace, Which permeates everything desired. 67 As for the statement that \"The five desired [sense objects], form, sound, and so on, are concentrated and made one with the sense faculties,\" 67 This part of this verse resembles verse 41 of Nagarjuna's Letter to a Friend (thanks to Dr. Lozang Jampal for this information)."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp it means that both sense faculty and object are included as both faculty and object. In the statement in the Illumination of the Lamp: \"The five buddhas are the eye, and so on, in union with them, true union, by uniting with them as the five buddhas, thereby even form and so on are buddhas\"; the phrase \"The fi ve buddhas are the eye etc. in union with them\" though it is intelligible, the translation is a bit awkward. As for the true uniting of the fi ve [sense organs], eye, and so on, with the five buddhas, from Vairochana to Ak!?hobhya, the five [sense ob­jects], fo rm, sound, and so on are also connected to the fi ve clans. Thus, to say that both the faculties and objects are buddhas is to designate them as totally purified deities; that is contemplation. That is [broken down] in­to five-examination and so on. In this context of explaining the general definition, when it is explained that the contemplation [branch] is that which meditates objects and faculties as deities, it is just for illustration. According to the context of the body isolation, one should understand that one also meditates the aggregates as deities. Therefore, do not think that it is only the body of the deity that one meditates on. One must also meditate the re ality of the deity, as one can understand from the context of the extensive explanation. [98aJ In the Elixir Secret, there are the fi ve desired [objects] and the five aggregates, and each has [further] internal classifications, but that does not mean that they are classified as fi ve for the sake of abbreviation. The sense faculty, the object, and the faculties' cognition are the three secrets; and the idea that \"the three sets of fi ve have the nature of the fi ve buddha­clans\" is [the contemplation component called] \"examination.\" The analy­sis [component] is that that these three sets of fi ve are analyzed as of the nature of the fi ve clans. Patsab and Chag translate \"the three secrets are examination,\" which is appropriate, since there is no point in bringing this up fu rther in the commentary. Then, one enjoys that examination, dwelling further on that object by analyzing it; and that is [the contempla­tion component of] analysis. Since the Elixir Secret explains that analysis is meditating through distinguishing, the components of examination and analysis are differentiated by fi neness of discrimination, while both of them are body isolations cultivated in aftermath states. Thus, fi rst on the occasion of re traction, you learn to view things such as objects and senses as the transformations of bliss-void. As that"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation · 205 stabilizes, you learn contemplation wherein those bliss-void transforma­tions arise as deities. Here, the Illumination of the Lamp says: Thus having analyzed, when one confronts the entry into thatness, that having the nature of mental bliss is the contact with joy. Then, when one enters manifestly into thatness, that bliss which one attains with the nature of body fluency and so on, is comprised as bliss. Joy is said to be mental bliss, and [pure] bliss is body fluency. \"And so on\" indicates the bliss of mental fluency. The former is attained by confronting entry into thatness, 198b1 and the latter is attained having entered into thatness. Patsab's translation says \"while thus analyzing,\" and Chag's translation says \"from thus having analyzed.\" The two old translations say \"thus having analyzed.\" The meaning there is that both examination and analysis are referred to by saying \"thus having ana­lyzed.\" \"By entering thatness, joy and bliss will be attained\" indicates the future attainment of the latter [components of contemplation]. \"Entering into\" thatness and \"confronting\" thatness are similar in import, but as for the way in which joy and bliss are attained by that process; first you attain great bliss by the power of meditating the subtle [drop] in the lower door [of the central channel], and then you meditate with that [bliss] being focused on the ascertainment of the import of thatness. Thereby you will attain contact with the distinctive mental bliss of realiz­ing voidness and you will attain the physical and mental fluency that arise from realizing voidness. Actual physical fluency is a special kind of tangible experience which makes the body become extremely adept, but here it is not that [type]. This is the bliss of fluency which becomes the property that causes both body and mind to become extremely adept. It is a mental fun­ction which is a correlate of the previous mental bliss. By practicing as previously explained or by becoming accustomed to that, thereby you terminate the six [subjective] consciousnesses, visual and so on, and the six objects, form and so on, and [you realize] voidness with respect to the mind's pe rception of the subject-object dichotomy. Therefore, [such] one pointedness of mind, defined as primal wisdom. is called one's \"nature of mind.\" I'J9ul Here, the Chag translation !of the Illumination of the Lamp I says:"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"206 · Brilliant lllumination of the Lamp and The nature of all buddhas is peace; all of them totally abide in space ... Such a yogi/ni's mind is peace, the nature of all buddhas. [The mind of contemplation] is said to be \"peace\" because it has eliminated the notions of objects and so on, and is merely vision. Previous statements, such as \"This ultimately occurs in unity with universal voidness\" are good, but the Patsab translation's \"that cul­minates only in universal voidness\" is better. As for that previous one-pointedness of mind, it means the entry into voidness, the nature of all buddhas, and the word \"merely\" means peace in that it cuts off all ideations at that time. \"Space\" means void, and \"uni­versal void\" is the fo urth void. When you wholly abide there, you enter by going through the three previous voids. These two lines explain one-pointedness of mind. Therefore, what Lan said: If one interprets one-pointedness of mind as mind isola­tion, then, in short, by the expression \"the actuality of all buddhas\" one means the magic body, and by the rest of that one refers to clear light ... is incorrect. In the context of the body isolation of the elements, there is the cryptic explanation of the prologue of [of the Esoteric Community Ta ntra] in the Vajra Rosary: Wind, fire, water, and earth, Are the four, Lochana and so on, Known as three types of natural primal wisdom, They grant the buddha enlightenment. It states that the four elements-realized as Locana, and so on-should be understood as having the nature of the three wisdoms of the three voids, [luminance, radiance, and imminence]; 199bl and therefore the path-time three voids' primal wisdom is present during body isolation. The previous mention of the fourth void is metaphoric clear light, and its arisal is never precluded from body isolation up to the magic body. However, the mention of the three voids being present before the magic body intends that metaphoric clear light be included in the great void of"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation · 207 imminence. Therefore, in these contexts, the entry of imminence into clear light should be understood as the imminence in which you become unconscious, after which you enter into the cloudless-sky-like absorption in universal voidness. Well here you might think that the above general definition of con­templation seems to account for examination and analysis, but it does not seem to describe joy. bliss, and one-pointedness of mind; so would not those three become severed from that sort of contemplation? This is not a problem, since that explanation of contemplation as the meditation of the senses and objects and so on as deities includes both the meditation of the deities with forms of faces and hands and also the meditation focusing on the thatness of the deities. In the Extreme Illumi­nation of the Lamp it is stated that when one engages objects, the idea that the senses and so on, the three, have the nature of the five clans, is \"examination,\" the idea that those are the nature of the five primal wis­doms is ideational \"analysis,\" the arisal of a distinctive joy from thinking \"I am a realization of thatness\" is \"joy,\" and \"bliss\" is explained as physi­cal fluency coming from attaining that mental bliss. And examination and analysis are explained to be luminance, joy to be radiance, and bliss to be imminence. And this [text] does seem to claim the presence [here] of the three primal wisdoms of mind isolation. In this regard, the meaning of the three primal wisdoms [tOOal as stated in the Wisdom Vaj ra Compendium is the objective explained in the Integrated Practices in the context of mind isolation, where there is the problem of not being thoroughly explicit about the way in which what sort of habit pattern holds that object. And Naropa's explanation of these two branches [retraction and contemplation] appears just to consist of his quoting of the Illumination of the Lamp. Although one should explain in detail this six-branched yoga of the Noble system, since my predecessors did not seem to give the details, here I explained in detail, and will do so [even more] below. [Vl.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTA\"6\"-How to put into practice the body isolation] The sixth has three parts: [a\"] How to concentrate the wind-energies by meditating the subtle; [b \"] How melting bliss arises from that; and [c\"] How to cultivate samadhic and aftermath [body isolations] when [bliss] arises."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"208 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTA\"6\"a\" -How to concentrate the wind-energies by meditating the subtle] Having discovered the stable yoga which visualizes the subtle man­dala, you then become able to develop a distinctive melting bliss. Once that has emerged, then you already know how to produce joy, and you should cultivate it as will be explained. However, if you discover that, but [melting bliss] does not emerge, in the interim you should meditate abiding in the yoga of the lord and lady. If that also is not there , if you practice the entry into the present, you should meditate after concluding a preliminary meditation of the yoga of the retinue of [the deities of] the mandala. As it is explained in the Concise Five Stages: One should know the fo ur kinds of essential points, Those of body, time, object, and wind-energy. The essential point of the body will be explained in the speech isolation. The essential point of time in general is continuity, but in specific it is when awareness is clear and you meditate in the afternoon in the time of fire. The essential point of wind-energy is sufficiently [explained in] our own system. As for the essential point of object, the place where one aims one's perception, the sixth chapter of the Illumination of the Lamp says that (JOObJ \"For the male, in the hole of the vajra there is a mere barley grain size hand symbol; and for the fe male there is the mere measure of a chickpea68 in her vagina.\" The third chapter of the Illumination of the Lamp explains that one should meditate the superficial spirit of enlight­enment, the size of a grain of mustard, in the mouth of one' s vajra, as having the nature of the five clans. And in the Personal Instruction [of ManjushrT] it says: \"As previously quoted, one should meditate [it) in the center of the jewel\"; so there is no disagreement with the statement \"Meditate [it] in the hole of the vajra.\" \"Meditate in the mouth of the vajra\" intends the lower opening of the dhati; those two are similar. The Personal Instruction explains that with the clear light of the seed at the heart center one invites the mandala, melts those absorbed into the heart center, whence they descend as a drop and abide in the jewel. 68 Sanskrit ca{laka means chickpea."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chapter IV-Body Isolation· 209 The Illumination of the Lamp explains that you should meditate in harmony with the process of birth in existence, as when the basic time male and female sexually unite and the fire of passion melts the drop and it falls into the lotus; which makes plain the meditation of the drop thus produced descending to the lower door. The Illumination of the Lamp in­tends that the color of the drop should be the color of your deity. If you hold the mind in the extremely subtle drop, it is easy to cut off concep­tual thoughts, because it is easy to terminate the evolutionary wind­energy which drives those [conceptions]. However, if it seems that you can not hold it like that no matter what you do, then let it be a little bigger, and when you can hold it, then make it subtler. This could be a problem of jumping a stage of meditation, not having stabilized [well enough] on the creation stage. If one makes it stable, then there is no problem of of not being able to h old the mind on such an object. The distinctive way of holding the mind, the way of cultivating without depression and elation, not desiring the termination of the wind­energy even though the object is well-held, [tOtal how to proceed when you are not ready to generate such an intense bliss and so on, and the way to dispel the arisal of some odds and ends of previous discomfort in desiring to terminate the energy, etc.-all these private instructions are explained in detail elsewhere.

The Personal Instruction also says that the five signs emerge in the contexts of meditating the subtle [object] in the lower door and the indestructible [drop] in the heart; so you should understand that these signs emerge then by performing those two [types of] vajra recitation. As for the Illumination of the Lamp explaining the entry into clear light through the door of the five signs, though it should be explained that the entry into clear light comes [only] after having attained mind iso­lation and the magic body by completing the three life-energy controls, nevertheless it is not that [Chandrakirti] does not accept the arisal of those signs on the lesser occasions of entering into the metaphoric clear light. So there is no contradiction in explaining the branch of endurance as an entry into the clear light which abides in insubstantiality by the 69 In the quote just given, \"endurance\" is spelled in Tibetan as gzung ba, perhaps old­fashioned way of spelling it, whereas Tsong Khapa correctly writes 'dzin pa in his gloss."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Chapter JV-Body Isolation· 211 progression of the signs on the occasion of meditation on the subtle [drop] in the lower door.

It is explained that you will achieve the clear light of endurance, either with the yoga of the subtle vowels and consonants abiding in the navel channel, or meditating the drop in the tip of the vajra, or meditating with the furor yoga, and so on, whichever [of these] are suitable. It is explained in agreement even in the Indian treatise of the six-branched yoga of the Jfianapada system. So this is excellent. Therefore, when one holds the mind in the point of the great life-energy of the channels of the body, it is not like other foci of the mind. The practice of meditating the subtle in the lower door II02al exists up to there, but as explained above, if one doesn't know the advantages of medita ting on that, then it seems one will not find certitude about the personal instructions. This is well explained depending on the Further Ta ntra and the statements of His Holiness Mafijushri.

So, it is not necessary that the life-wind-energy dissolve into the dhati for the furor-fire to burn and melt the spirit of enlighten­ment. Therefore, certain types of persons meditate as above and so expe­rience the bliss of the melting of the spirit of enlightenment, though their wind-energies do not dissolve into the dhati. This kind of similar [experience] can happen to [people in general], as [those that are achieved by yogi/nis] meditating other personal instruc­tions for penetrating the vital points in the body. When such a drop reaches the vajra jewel, it seems to be very difficult to retain. So one must first, by the outer and inner descending methods, forcefully reverse the descent of the enlightenment spirit from those places [higher in the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"21 2 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp system] before it reaches the jewel. As soon as it reaches the vajra, if it cannot be diffused within the body, the many [redirecting] strains [needed] to instantly reverse it and the forceful methods of reversing it seem to produce sickness. And even if [some] have already implemented many procedures of such diffusion, JI02bl it does not seem that they know the systems of distinguishing the enlightenment spirit melting with the wind­energies dissolving into the dhati from its melting without [the wind­energies dissolving there], and thus how to determine the difficulty or ease of retaining the enlightenment spirit, the necessity of its forceful reversal or lack [of such necessity], and whether or not one will become sick by not spreading the reversed [spirit] within the body. About that, as for the necessity of the melting of the enlightenment spirit by burning the furor-fire by the power of meditating the path, it is for the sake for generating the orgasmic intuitive wisdom. In generating that [furor fire], the enlightenment spirit melts and falls; if it does not generally reach below the navel and particularly reach into the jewel and stay there somewhat without emitting, you can never develop the fully defined orgasmic [wisdom]. And to equate this orgasmic [wisdom] with the great bliss of the perfection stage, it must be one that abides by the power of dissolving the wind-energies. If the enlightenment spirit is melted by the power of dissolving the wind-energies into the dhati, then it will be held in the tip of the jewel and will not emit outward until the fully defined orgasmic [bliss] has been generated. This is because, when the enlightenment spirit descends from the crown [wheel] by stage after stage, as the wind-energies become weaker and weaker and it reaches the jewel, the wind-energy's function which would push that enlightenment spirit outside becomes calmed. At that point, it will not emit until one arises from the orgasmic samadhi. When you do arise, as the energy can become greatly agitated, you must know the art of not emitting [the enlightenment spirit]. In that case, even if you do not practice the method of reversing [the spirit] at the first occasion when you are not accustomed [to the experience] and the method of reversing it later [when you are accustomed], again, when it goes back upwards [in the body] at both times of naturally going in reverse again, there is definitely no arisal of sickness by its not having spread out within the body.

As for the fact that, in the Tantras and the great Indian treatises, these subjects do not occur as they do in other practical instructions, it is because of the essential point that the principle [jewel-like] disciple of this teaching will quickly generate the wind-energy-dissolving perfection stage, [and so] such practical instructions are not necessary. As for the process of generating the four joys in descending order, as the enlightenment spirit melts and reaches from place to place, the Vaj ra Rosary Ta ntra says: Then one should teach the emerging order: In the crown of the great bliss wheel, It is said to be \"joy\"; In the wheel of beatitude it is \"supreme joy\"; In the Dharma wheel it is \"ecstatic joy\"; And in the emanation wheel \"orgasmic joy\"­All these are caused to be experienced.

In the Sheaf of In structions it is explained that the four upward-surging orgasmic blisses are differentiated into small, medium, great, and intensely great. The upward-surging four blisses are said to be more intense than the downward-falling four blisses. When surging from below, until the rever­sal has become firm at the crown, bliss is not stable.

When it descends into the joints of all the limbs, it is radiance. When the one drop emits from the tip of the vajra, it is imminence, and when it is firm in that very tip, then that is the arisal of clear light. Again, the first two [stages] are similar, but its going into the vajra tip or center being imminence, and abiding within the jewel being the arisal of clear light, are also explained as the four joys. There are many [explanations] like th is, [all of] which are similar. Munishri explains that when it reaches the root of the vajra, it is luminance; when it reaches the center of the jewel, it is imminence, and when it reaches the tip of the jewel, it is clear light. This implies that he must claim that when it reaches from the root of the vajra to the throat of the jewel, it is the arisal of radiance. The Great Seal Drop explains that the four joys are the same as lu­minance, ra diance, imminence, and clear light. The Root and Explana­tory Ta ntras of the Esoteric Community and treatises of the five Noble literatures do not contain explanations of the four joys as the four voids, and the five Noble father and sons do not say that when [the enlighten­ment spirit] melts and reaches this place, the four joys or the four voids arise, they just explain the arisal of luminance by dissolving the wind­energies and the arisal of radiance by the dissolving of mind, and so forth.

Here, great bliss is the life of the path, and making it firm, as it depends on the upward-surging bliss, is the extremely important way to produce it. Again, the Sheaf of Instructions says: With the arisal of that enlightenment-spirit, beginning from the jewel until it reaches the navel, it increases without emitting, and proceeds upwards. Taking this literally, [we would think that] when it does not emit from the jewel, it is as if it naturally reversed itself; but it is not so. Even though it does not emit, it can happen that it goes indivisibly where it will, without entering the very same path as it came down. And it can happen that even if it reverses direction, there is no certainty it will reach straight to the crown and it may spread out into the lower part of the body. Therefore, if it is necessary that it go to the crown by winding itself upwards, the yog1nimust do that purposefully. As the Vajra Rosary Ta ntra says: By the preceding of the thatness Of the wind-energies, it is driven upward.

All of those are very important, and especially they are methods which do not mistake the vital points of the path of the YoginiTantras; so you should understand them well.

In that regard, through determining the pure nature of all things, you first must understand all substantial things as transformations of voidness, and then through the process of uniting bliss and void, you must meditate them as transformations of great bliss. To explain those, in the Integrated Practices it says: \"I am pure by nature !\" which means \"My nature has been firmly created.\" And as for having visualized your­self as the great Vajradhara, with the nature of the three vajras, it is explained as the \"yoga of blessing.\" On this occasion of the single clan body isolation, yourself the yogi/ni develops a firm visualization that knows your natural purity, and are said to have meditated yourself as Vajradhara.

Furthermore, the Siitra quoted in the Commentary as: Beginning from the half session, having the nature of nine in the six wheels, until the very end of the half session ... also does not seem to be correct. Whatever the case, though it seems to be the meaning of that Ta ntra that the hundred and eight wind-energies are not non-comprised of the ten wind-energies, as it also seems difficult to posit the pattern of circulation of each of nine wind-energies in order in each of six wheels, [lllaJ we must still investigate this [question].

The Integrated Practices also states it in that way. The statement, \"this illumination of the reality of the five wind­energies has the actuality of the five wisdoms,\" that the [wind-energies] are the five wisdoms, should be understood as referring to the five clans. Now the vitalizing wind-energy circulating from the nostrils is the gross vitalizing energy, and the \"indestructible wind-energy\" staying in the heart center is the extremely subtle vitalizing wind-energy. As the Vajra Rosary Ta ntra states: And: In the sky of the chamber of the heart lotus The wisdom vajra always dwells ... The world realm of the great Lord Ak�hobhya is that very reality. The place where he always dwells Is called the \"life-wisdom.\" Thus, the wind-energy that always dwells in the heart center as long as one lives is explained as the vitalizing energy.

Therefore, as the Vaj ra Rosary explains that the wind-energies at the time of death dissolve from below upwards in the sequence of their original birth, and as it is taught that in the original [fetal] development the vital­izing wind-energy [is the] first [to] develop, it happens that in the end the wind-energies dissolve into the subtle vitalizing energy. Thus, also the Integrated Practices explanation that the wind-energies enter the inde­structible in the end means that they dissolve into the heart center's inde­structible energy. While the heart center's indestructible energy and drop stay within the dhati central channel of the heart center channel knot, the vitalizing energy that circulates from the nostrils, though abiding in the heart center, does not abide [exactly] there [in the center of the channel knot]. As for the Body Sp eech Mind Essence Chapter of the Vaj ra Rosary statement that the evacuative energy abides in the anus, in the middle of the secret center, the actual place is the lotus of the secret center, intend­ing that the evacuative energy evacuates \"great dirt\" from the anus. 1 Il2aJ The Illumination of the Lamp explanation of the earth energy abiding in the lotus of the anus also refers just to that secret center lotus. Here one objects: \"There is a statement of the Vaj ra Rosary, that: Both the sixty-four- and eight-petaled [wheels], as they face up and down [respectively], cause the vitalizing and evacuative [energies] to circulate by relying upward and downward.

Here one may wonder: \"Well, as it explains that the earth energy, the evacuative [wind-energy], circulates in the two nostrils, how can it be said to 'circulate relying downward' from the heart center?\"' That means that the evacuative energy cannot go up through the dhati path since it is blocked by the heart center channel knots; and the same [vice versa] for the vitalizing energy. Just as the vitalizing energy enters and exits from the nostrils from heart upward through the throat, so the evacuative energy enters and exits from the navel to the anus and the urethra. As the Red Ya mari Ta ntra states: Beginning in the navel, the evacuative [energy] Goes on the lower path to stop at the secret center; Having departed the heart to the throat. The vitalizing [energy] goes from the nostrils. [112bl The metabolic [fire-equalizing] energy abides equal with the furor of the navel. By reason of the Vajra Rosary statement that, blocked by the channel knot in the middle of the heart center, the vitalizing energy cannot go down from that place and the evacuative energy cannot go up, the three wind-energies that abide in the other three wheels also cannot likewise enter and exit through the center of the channel knots. As the Vajra Rosary states: Coming and going are manifested in the lotuses Of throat, heart, navel, and secret centers ... excluding the pervasive energy, such is the pattern of the coming and going of the other four energies in their abodes. Further, those abodes are determined by their first arisal and their final place they return to once completing their circulations, and it is not that their overall circulation always goes out only from those places and enters into only those places. When there is coming and going of the wind-energies, as for from which nostril they move, which wind-energy they are, from which ele­mental sphere, and what color they are; the Vajra Rosary states: Dwelling in the clans of the five buddhas, Emerging from the nostril hole, The five wind-energies truly move upward."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Chapter V -Speech Isolat ion in General · 231 They always change, acting in the body, By moving in the superficial nose, They emerge from that door.

This statement about \"emerging from the right, etc.\" is explained by the Integrated Practices as referring to the right and left nostrils and also both nostrils. The Vo w Arisal similar statement is to the same effect; not meaning, as [thought by the author of] the Vo w Arisal Commentary, as referring to the movement [113bl from the left, right, and center of each nostril. That the Vajra Rosary teaches thus does not contradict the Personal Instruction's teaching that wind-energy moves from the right nostril, water from the left, and earth and fire from both. This is because the former statement intends the movement in terms of the Lord [of the buddha-clan], and the latter, even when it mentions equal movement [means] movement in each nostril, and when it mentions movement in each nostril means movement in both nostrils, so its [statements on this are] never sure. The statement of movement in the left explained as movement in the right is for the sake of showing the uncertainty about the energy of each of the two nostrils. Finally, it will be explained that, when each energy of a primary element moves, the other three move in its retinue. Though these four \"movement from the right nostril etc.\" are not explained clearly from the Ta ntra or from the treatises of the father and son as \"this is the root energy,\" still you can understand if you combine this explanation of the wind-energies of the four Saviors and the previously quoted explanation that \"the vitalizing wind-energy etc. is this Savior etc.\" The Illumination of the Lamp explains that the four wind-energies of earth, water, fire, and wind respectively circulate from the lotuses of secret, heart, throat, and navel centers. In regard to color, from the quotes of the translations of the Vajra Rosary and the old translations of the Vajra Rosary and the Integrated Practices, the energy of the left emerges as green-yellow, and in its explanation that green yellow is described as the \"actuality of black light rays.\" From the quotes from the Patshab and Chag translations of Inte­grated Practices it is called green-blue, as also in the commentaries.

And in the Illumi­nation of the Lamp Sixth Chapter, except for explaining the right energy as actually red light rays, the other three colors are as explained above. Thus, though there are various explanations, vitalizing, evacuative, ascending, and metabolic wind-energies' independent colors are, in order, white, yellow, red, and black, as determined for each. As for there being light rays of five colors in each of them, one holds this as the meaning of the Integrated Practices statement: Granted that is so, each light ray which emerges, itself surely has five colored light rays; since even a single elemental sphere pervades all four elemental spheres. KaruQashrpa da explains that shyama can mean both green and black, so it should be taken as green-blue or green-black and not as green-yellow. Lak�hm\\ depending on the statement of the pervasive energy as Vairochana and the vitalizing energy as Ak�hobhya, explained them as white and black; but the latter contradicts many treatises, and though there is no clear word on the former, it is better to take it as clear blue according to Master Go.

And by this one can understand the other three as well. As for the way in which the other three wind-energies circulate by being incorporated within the ascending energy, they are generated like a single rainbow; as those other three are are under the power of the fire energy, they are reddish white, reddish yellow, and reddish green. By that one can understand how the metabolic wind-energy etc., [plus] three, cir­culating from the left etc., with a main wind-energy and three accom­panying wind-energies included in each case, operate. Thus, the state­ment that the ascending operates from the right, the metabolic from the left, and the vitalizing and evacuating from both equally is in terms of them operating as main wind-energies; it does not restrict their circula­tion as subordinate wind-energies. When the ascending energy moves the wind-energies of the four principal Saviors in the right nostril, there are first two hundred twenty­five Pandaravasini wind-energies, and then three sets of the same number, respectively, Tara, Lochana, and Mamak.I 11 lSaJ wind-energies.72 Further, in each of the Goddess wind-energies there are four Savior wind-energies. Likewise, when the metabolic energy in the left nostril moves the wind­energies of the four principal Saviors, [there are four sets of Goddess wind-energies], beginning from Tara [working round through Lochana and Mamaki to Pandara].

When the evacu­ative energy moves [from both equally slowly] the four Savior wind­energies, there are four sets of Goddess [wind-energies] beginning from Lochana wind-energies. The Revelation of the Hidden Intention explains that: 72 Thus, a 900-breath-long session of red fire Padman!ltha energies (with Karmanllthn, Ratnan!ltha, and Vajranlltha retinue energies) moving from the right consists of 225 Padmanlltha-Pand!lravlisinT energies, 225 Padman!ltha-Tilrll energies, 225 Padmanlltha­Lochanll energies, and 225 Padmanlltha-Mamak.T energies."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Chapter V-Speech Isolation in General · 235 Pandara and so forth in order, Above and on the side, in front and below, Having the spheres of fire and wind and earth And water ... thus Pandara wind-energies operate above, Tara wind-energies on the side, Lochana wind-energies in the front, and Mamakr wind-energies below; and those four are explained respectively as four spheres from fire to earth. Such being the case, as for each energy, the ascending etc., in each set of the circulation of four wind-energies of the clans, there are four Goddess wind-energies to be distinguished, which do not operate at one time. As the four wind-energies distinguished as Savior wind-energies operate at one time and the Goddess wind-energies only operate succes­sively, and there are no wind-energies other than the savior wind-energies that operate together, the assertion of Kp�hQa Samayavajra, that one energy operates in the center and the other four abide in the directions, and that the five all operate at one time, is not good; and the position of Tsunmojen that the four wind-energies do operate together indistinguish­ably like a single rainbow, is good. Thus, the explanation of the other [115b] system that takes the five subordinate [wind-energies] as operating simultaneously in the center and directions is again different from this; so the \"operating from the above\" etc. is explained as successive and not simultaneous. According to the expression in the Chag translation \"above, on the side, equal below ... ,\" when four Goddess wind-energies are explained in each set of nine hundred wind-energies, the fire Pandara wind-energies operate in the upper part of the nostril, the wind Tara wind-energies operate from the side of the nostrils, the earth Lochana wind-energies operate equally from the middle of both left and right nostrils, and the water Mamakr wind-energies operate from the lower part of the nostrils. That agrees with Shrrdhara who, having posited wind-energies of the four elements in the wind-energies of each of the transits, explained the operation of the earth energy in the center and the wind energy from the two sides. The Samputa [Tantra] explanation of operation from the side, and others' explanation of operating from a facet, are taken as \"operating from the side,\" while the meaning of \"operating equally\" and \"frontally\""},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp is \"operating from the center. \" If there is operation from the two sides of the nostril, it should be successive. In the context of the comment in the Ta ntra \"upon the five wind­energies,\" it is mentioned that the pervasive energy also emerges from the nostrils, thinking about the explanation below that it emerges in the end at death; so except for its circulating there at the time of death, it does not circulate there in life. This is the position of Lak�hm\\ Alaritka­kalas ha, and many fo rmer Tibetans. Ekalas hanirgho�ha explains that in the present life it emerges in the pattern of whatever elemental sphere emerges, and at the time of death emerges in the pattern of being princi­pal. In the Sheaf of Instructions, there is a third explanation, that the wind-energies operating in the Devil-free channel, [tt6aJ as they are life­exhausting wind-energies, are pervasive wind-energies. Though there are those three explanations, the pattern of whether or not the pervasive energy that pervades all the joints operates in the nostrils is better [under­stood] according to the fi rst explanation. Therefore, though one can contract [in meditation] the wind-energies that cause inhalation and exhalation through the nostrils, there are many pervasive wind-energies that cannot be contracted-and yet they must be contracted [eventually]; because the Sheaf of In structions explains the meaning of the Samputa {Tantra] teaching about practicing vase-breathing and contracting the wind-energies of the twenty-four places as referring to the contraction of the pervasive wind-energies.

One must investigate whether these refer to the same channels in the heart center such as \"Triply twisted\" etc., explained as the channels for the five objects.

Some of the fi ve branch wind-energies function together with the wind­energies that operate in the nostrils; or else they apply themselves what­ever way is appropriate.

In the In tegrated Practices, thinking of the state ment in the context of answering the questions about these, as to what the ten wind-energies do and where they abide, the functions of the wind-energies are explained: However, as to their functions, the five root wind-energies abide in the parts of the bodies and perform the func­tions of the body.

It is also stated that: \" ... for that reason all of us living beings [117bl are a world in movement ... \" And if one said that the physical body caused all movement and agitation, giving that as the reason, it would not apply to \"all of us\" living beings, [since some do not have gross bodies, but all are moved around by gross or subtle wind­energies]. If one wonders: \"As for the material body being moved by wind­energy, it is not the same with consciousness, so what is the meaning of that [wind] moving [consciousness]?\" Lak.�hmi et al. say that the discernment of objects by the six con­sciousnesses depends on their being impelled by wind-energies; other­wise, [without] them, one would not see at all, li ke a blind person. And therefore these two when connected together, like a cripple [conscious­ness, who can see] and a blind person [wind-energy, who can walk], can achieve their purposes. The Revelation of the Hidden Intention states: Going, performing acts such as [seeing] objects, Here, they depend on that [wind-energy function] ... that performing the functions of going and moving etc. and perceiving objects all depend on the wind-energies. Since the Integrated Practices states that the five [branch] wind-energies abide in the sense-faculties and perform the functions of the objects and senses, one does have to accept that the function of consciousness in holding its objects depends on wind-energies. Nevertheless, one cannot use that re ason to posit that wind-energy is the mount of consciousness, just as the senses and objects themselves [are not mounts of consciousness]. Furthermore, the Integrated Practices states that one gradually moves out of the immersion in the subtle realm of luminance, and, condi­tioned by that, one experiences all the natural instincts day and night. And the Great Brahmin [Saraha] also said [in an Enlightenment Song]: This, [luminance-] mentality once withdrawn, Is energized by wind-energy; It moves, is a gitated, and becomes very disturbed. That is, when energized by the wind-energy, the mind is produced in a very agitated form. Thus, though they accept that all agitations of the mind, either conceptual or nonconceptual, arc caused by wind-energy."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"240 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp still you should not think that just for that reason you have discovered the meaning of positing energy as the mount of consciousness. If one wonders: Well then, how is it [so posited]? [118al As consciousness is not embodied, it has no independent power to come and go in relation to objects; but when it functions together with wind-energy, then it becomes capable of relating to objects. The Inte­grated Practices states that the three luminances are free of coming and going; and again, in answer to the questions, \"How does it expand and contract in the body day and night? What is witness to this?\" it states, after explaining how those three [luminances] are formless, that: Granted it is so: but as it is endowed with luminance, thus on can witness it when [it is] together with the element of wind. The meaning of that is that, granted that the three consciousnesses are disembodied, as they have the luminance [that goes along with subtle] energy, they are caused to come and go, just as the witness together with the wind-energy comes and goes without resting. Therefore, its going to objects by way of the wind-energy is the meaning of the \"mind going mounted on the energy.\" And in that regard, there are instances of the mind both serving and not serving to pick up the object. Further, when progression in the wind-energy itself upon which one is mounted occurs from prior to later, although there is no progre ss from one objective area to another, it is not that there is no objective progression. [A ryadeva] states in thelntegrated Practices: The subtle element and the consciousness luminances, as they are immaterial, they become mingled like butter poured in butter, and they cause the completion of all activities, mundane and transcendental. Here, wind-energy and mind are stated to be mingled like butter in butter; hence Lak�hmts pronouncement that they are one actuality is excellent.

This can also be understood from the Four Hundred Commentary. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c '3 'd TB \"3 \"e\"-How the w ind-encrgies transit] The fifth has two parts: [i\"] The way [the wind-energy] transits or does not transit from one nostril to another; and [ii \"] The way it transits from one petal and elemental sphere to another. 74 IVI.B.3.b.ii.c'3 'dTB\"3\"e\"i\"-The way (the wind-energy) transits and does not transit from one nostril to another] From the Time Machine literature, six wind-energies- wind­energies of earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness- move from the right and [the same] six wind-energies move in reverse order from the left.

In navigating through them, one must remember that this is the vajra recitation section, so the aim is to understand the natural circulation of the body's inner winds (breaths and other energies) throughout the nervous syst em, in order to fuse their functions with the transformative energy of mantra, to isolate all speech and subtle energies from ordinary naturalness and experience and manifest it as the play of enlightened divine beings.

The Illumination of the Lamp Fourteenth Chapter, with a quote said to be from the Explana­tory Ta ntra , elucidates the meaning of the statement that the four element wind-energies endure each a half session, explaining that the four ele­mental sphere wind-energies emerge from the four centers such as the secret center, and explaining that the period of enduring a half session is a performing of the four activities such as peace. Thus, the period of each half session is a set of nine hundred; and the four sphere wind-energies, when moving in the nostril, seem to measure each in their period of duration as a half session. Thus it does not intend to explain that nine hundred in the former half session and another continuous nine hundred give eighteen hundred movings and transit to another nostril.

Thus, a \"half-session\" in that context and the \"half-period\" of the two thousand seven hundred, though nominally similar, are different in meaning.

And if one thinks it refers to the Ti me Machine explanation of fo ur empty petals in the sixty-four navel chakra petals, that is not the meaning. 77 This count would give 64 \"hours\" (Tib. chu tshocl) in a day, therefore the \"hour\" here is 22.5 of Western \"minutes\" long. 78 In this case the \"hours\" of a 60 \"hour\" day would be 24 minutes long."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Chapter V-Speech Isolation in General · 247 The Vo w Arisal says: The wind-energies of the sixteen Transit factors happening in a day, Always in [one or both of the] nostrils, Truly move a half session each. 79 Thus it sets up sixteen half sessions per day and explains the sixteen tran­sits taught as moving in the nostrils in each half session; but this is not to be interpreted as the sixteen transit-arrivals in the left and right nostrils. For, in that Tantra, it explains the fire and wind sphere [wind-energies] as each moving [respectively] in the right and left nostril, and the earth and water sphere [wind-energies] as moving equally in both nostrils.

That being so. as the equal moving from the two nostrils and the individual nostril moving are equal in time, the way of counting each as a nine hun­dred set of equal moving must be interpreted as indicating one cycle of inhalation and exhalation as one energy together. So one must reflect criti­cally as to whether one must employ a different method of counting when dealing with the wind-energies moving from each nostril individually. Thus, the equal moving of the two wind-energies of left and right, when their degree of force, is similar being short in duration, while equal moving of alternating strength and weakness seeems to take longer dura­tion; so both of them are considered as equally moving. As for the way of equal moving in the transit-interval from the right to the left, as the right energy becomes weaker, in the interval when it is not manifest as just that, the moving in the left comes somewhat weakly, and it is held from that; and when its moving [in the left] becomes a little stronger, the right becomes proportionately weaker. with finally even the subtlest moving ceasing, at exactly which time the left begins to move alone. The transit from the left to the right is just similar.

Again when the life-wind-energy arises There are the various evolutionary winds. Together with that is consciousness And again one lives in the three worlds. Therefrom is evolution and likewise birth, Therefrom instincts such as lust, And therefrom again death and birth. Thus it is like a revolving wheei.84 Such statements are not to disagree with the statements that the self habit is the root of the life cycle, by teaching that the energy is the root of the life cycle. The Integrated Practices also makes the same statement. Depending on the self habit and the property habit, one performs virtue and vice, and one thus enters into the life cycle re volving between heav­enly and hellish realms; this process is established by three SOtras such as the Eight Thousand. And Nagarjuna declared [the following] to clearly show their meaning: 84 Except for the introduction of the wind-energy role in the process, this closely resem­bles Nagarjuna's description of th life cycle process in his Jewel Rosary."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"258 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp If all this is naturally void and unproduced How could one circle throughout [the realm of] evolution, Here where pleasure and pain, and so on, function?

All of these are merely mind, Truly arising in the form of illusion; Wherein by virtuous and vicious evolutionary action, One is born in heaven and hell. This is the system common to the Sotra and Tantra texts. [t27bl Therefore, the statement that one is born in the life cycle through the wind-energy should be understood as referring to the auxiliary condition of being born in the life cycle through the afflictions of the self habit, and so on. That is the general function of the wind-energies, but as for their individual fu nctions: The function of the vitalizing energy is stated in the Vajra Rosary: From the continuum of the door of sense, Life-wind-energy and exertion move, And as it totally moves at all times, It is explained to be \"life-wind-energy.\" In regard to this, there are many different translations in other trans­lations of the Vajra Rosary and in [other texts] where it is cited. It means that the continuous activities of wind-energies entering and emerging from the doors of the five senses are mainly energized by the power of that [vitalizing energy] and are nourished by this, which is the meaning of the \"life-wind-energy\" [function]. The meaning of \"exertion\" being their long-term expansion, it has the function of long-term expansion; that it has these two functions is the interpretation of Abhayakara. The Elixir Secret explains it[s fu nction] as making the wind-energies go out and in the door[s] of the sense[s].

And the drawing down of the wind-energies brings them specially to the two doors of the genital region and also to the navel as explained above. The function of the emetabolic energy [stated in the Vaj ra Rosary]: Laughing, eating, licking, Drinking [128aJ and sucking, Whatever always [makes it] equalized Is called \"metabolic wind-energy.\" The Chag translation explains its function as making food and drink homogeneous, and the verse quoted in the Sheaf of Instructions reads: It is homogenizing as it draws into equality Food and drink and so on at the navel region.

Having explained the way of executing functions in common be­tween ordinary persons and yogi/nis, now I should explain particularly how the wind-energies function for the yogi/nis. Having practiced vajra recitation of the four root wind-energies, one executes the functions of achieving the four ritual activities such as pacification and so forth, causing the achievement of the ordinary accomplishments. Again, prac­ticing vajra recitation of those four wind-energies, one develops the four voids and creates the magic body with the subtle energy thereby causing achievement of the supreme accomplishment. Practicing the vajra recitation with the fi ve branch wind-energies, one is caused to achieve the fi ve clairvoyances such as the divine eye, and one is caused to have all objective perception become the blaze of great bliss. Practic­ing vajra recitation with the pervasive energy one achieves the supreme in the between, causing the experience of clear light transparence, accord­ing to the word of the ancient sages.

Thus it teaches that to purify the instincts for wandering in the life cycle, you \"discern the drop which causes the opening of the ignorance knot that binds the heart center dhati channel,\" which means you should meditate the vajra recitation. 85 As explained above, at the boundary be­tween the moving and unmoving of the instinctual notions, you recog­nize the arisal of the four voids, and you understand the need to meditate a life-energy control such as the vajra recitation in order to generate such a sequence in your life-process; and this is the unexcelled knowledge of the key of spiritual practice that relies on the explanation of wind-energy. Further, having well negated the object held by the two self habits, having sought the wisdom realizing selflessness decisively certain of the import of selflessness, then you meditate on that and radically overcome the t wo obscurations-all the supreme experts in all that [process] agree [on this point]. However, when meditating profound voidness, already having well determined it thus by learning and reflection, other vehicles and the lower Tantra types do not teach the need for the distinctive subjectivity of great bliss as taught in this [unexcelled] vehicle; and thus it is the distinctive characteristic of this unexcelled vehicle. Whatever the special art you use to develop the four joys and four voids, it is through the door of the great bliss that it is developed. And since that cannot be completely produced until the wind-energies that 85 Here we have a very clear description of the connection, through the concept of the subtle body, with wind-energies, channels and their knots, and awareness-drops, of the process of critical wisdom unraveling the confusions of the self habits and identity habits as parallel to the process of wind-energy and channel structure meditation unraveling the sixfold heart center knot, called the \"knot of ignorance.\" You could say this is the mind­body key point of Unexcelled Yoga Tantra."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"262 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp drive the instinctual notions are blocked, you should strive in the art of blocking the wind-energy. Therefore, 1129hJ as it is stated that the mind stays steady by using wind-energy meditation to eradicate the wind-energy's readiness to move, if you entertain such ideas as- \"even without meditating the wind-energies if one knows how to cultivate the thoughtless mind-setting free of de­pression and agitation, and by that practice itself one discovers firm samadhi, what's the use of wind-energy meditation?\" or \"if one stabilizes the mind abiding thoughtless, that itself is the insertion of the wind­energies into the dhati channel, so one need not meditate anything else!\" -then you must explain the following. In general, the mere stable abid­ing of the mind in thoughtlessness is shared in common with outsiders and insiders and Individual and Universal Vehicles, and in particular the immaculate samadhi abiding thought-free on the import of voidness is shared in common with the Ve hicle of the Transcendences; so for them, how can the wind-energy yoga involving meditating on the penetration of the vital points in the body be necessary? However, even though one has attained such a samadhi, that does not mean that one has attained the great bliss by power of the wind-energies dissolving in the dhati channel. There­fore, the \"stable mind\" meant in the expression \"stable mind attained by blocking the movement of the evolutionary wind-energies\" is the mind of orgasmic bliss. As Saraha declared [in an Enlightenment Song]: Here, mentality contracted, the wind-energy energizes, It moves and lifts and grows quite uncalm, When one realizes the orgasmic nature, [Only] thereby does one become stable. To generate that requires the dissolving of the evolutionary wind­energies into the dhati and the blazing of the furor-fire; and the minds of those [yog1nJ;), while nominally also being \"thoughtless\" and \"blissful,\" are definitely different [from those of yog1n1i in ordinary meditative trances and blisses]. But this has been much explained above. Once you have decisive insight into the view of voidness, [130ul when you meditate, if you enter into the perfection stage because of the key of needing to meditate by means of that melting bliss, first, there are many doors taught for penetrating the vital points in the body, which is the art of generating great bliss. Therefore you should not persist in thinking that \"the perfection stage is not profound with its channel-"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Chapter V-Speech Isolation in General · 263 energy-drop yoga. wind-energy yoga, and so on, and has no meditation on voidness.\" Thus the stopping of the evolutionary wind-energies by meditating wind-energy yogas is a stopping in general of the ten wind­energies that cause entry and emergence in the doors of senses relying on the two channels, and a stopping in particular of the two main wind­energies, vitalizing and evacuating, from moving in the right and left channels. For those [two main] wind-energies, when not pushed into the dhati channel, rely on the other channels and cause entrance and emer­gence, and thus drive the eighty instinctual patterns- [all of] which creates an obstacle to the realization of the four voids. To fully generate the universal bliss requires a powerful melting of the enlightenment spirit, which itself requires a powerful blazing of furor, and its special blazing requires the evacuative energy to dissolve into the dhati channel from below. For that you need to stop the entry and emergence of the evacuative energy in the lower door, for which, as explained above, you must perform the procedures of entry and emergence in the upper and lower nostril apertures. If you understand the previously explained process of entering into the life cycle shared in common with both vehicles, you know the need to eliminate its root, the self habit, and you come to seek the decisive insight into the view of selflessness. If you know the uncommon process of entry to the life cycle by power of wind-energies, you see the need to stop the evolutionary wind-energies [130bJ that drive the instinctual notional patterns, and you come to develop a decisive insight into the instruction of penetrating the vital points in the body, the art of stopping that [evolutionary wind-energy]. You then come to practice, taking as the essence the path that joins bliss and void, ascertaining the import of void­ness with the great bliss developed from that art [of stopping the evolut­ionary wind-energies]. In this way you do not miss the essential key of the [mentor's] personal instruction. And if you do otherwise, you do not distinguish the subtle differences between great bliss and other blisses, you do not discover the ultimate view by distinguishing the coarse and subtle voids, and though you praise the bliss-void-union, it is no more than delighting in the mere name. And that essence explained in both [Unexcelled Yoga] Tantric categories is chiefly the distinctive means to attain the truth body. The distinctive means of attaining the material body is explained [especially] clearly in this [Father Tantra] system, as has been explained above and will be further explained below."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"264 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd To\"4\"-Teaching the ultimate reality of mantra] The fourth has five parts, explaining: [a\"] Collecting the mantra; [b\") The symbol of mantra; [c\") The import of mantra; [d\"] The ulti­mate of mantra; and [e\") Short \"A,\" root of mantra.

As for the mantras collected from there, these are all those stated in the Tantras such as essence-, close-essence-, and rosary-mantras [of various deities] and so forth. [I3IaJ As for the way they are collected, the Tantras state numerous ways of collecting mantras. As for the reality of all such mantras, it is the three letters OM AI:I HOM.

Also from the Illumination of the Lamp Te nth Chapter, there is an expla­nation of the three mantras, male, and so on, being collectible into the three syllables, which takes the collected mantras as the three. The way of interpreting mantras as male, female, and neuter and the way to collect them into the three syllables was mentioned \"accord­ing to the personal instruction attained.\" Aside from that, they are not clearly explained in the treatises of the five father and sons, and it does not seem that other explanations can afford confidence of mind. As for our own interpretation, mantras are classed as threefold when they per­tain to a male deity, a female deity, or used for both, and since all mantra deities taught are collected in the three vajras, all mantras are collected into the three letters. Thus the three letters are the essence of all mantras. The essence of all body vajra clan deities being the letter OM, the OM letter is the chief of all mantras of that clan. And the other two [speech and mind] should be understood in the same way. If one interprets according to the basis of collection, one should do this according to the Vaj ra Essence Ornament Ta ntra statement that the twelve tilis are female, the KA, CHA, TA, TA , and PA groups are male, and the four [semi-vowels] 8. and t, [each short and long], are neuter. As for the three letters, it is obvious that OM is male, A/:1 is female, and HOM must be neuter. Such scholars as Kalden Drakpa claim that the vowels and conso­nants are collected into the first letters of the eight groups, A, KA, CHA, TA, TA, PA, YA, SHA, and those ei ght into A, KA, YA, SHA, and those four"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"266 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp into A. KA, YA, and those three again are transformed into female Al:f. male HOM, ll32al and neuter OM. Thus there are measureless ways to col­lect mantras from the mantra base, but in this context they are collected into OM A/:1 HOMand each of those comes from three syllables along with the indestructible, and so to collect all mantras into the three sylla­bles is to concentrate mantras. As for the need to show all mantras as concentrating in the three syl­lables, it is to make it understood that the ability to attain accomplish­ments of all other mantras exists in the three syllables, and so theirs is the ultimate recitation of all verbal recitations. For, as both Root and com­mentary of the [Esoteric Community] Te nth Chapter state, the creation stage practitioner, if s/he does not attain the powers after incorporating the experiences of the three conducts, s/he can command the heart essence of all deities by the three letter recitation mantras. And [it is also the case,] since, as will be explained, the creation stage practitioner becomes able to achieve all four ritual activities from the door of this [three syllable recitation]. Such being the case, when [the three mantras] are recited, connect­ing the definitive meaning three letter recitation indivisibly with the three wind-energies, that is the vajra recitation. What need to mention that it has the power of all verbal mantra recitations to induce the heart stream of all deities to cause them to bless the practitioner. Thus, not only does vajra recitation have the excellence of collecting wind-energies in the dhati channel through applying wind-energy yoga, but it also generates a dis­tinctive power from the door of reciting mantras. And so you must become certain about the way in which it is unexcelled, different from [132bl other wind-energy yogas. As for what one should do with such a sort of three syllables, there are two Integrated Practices statements. First, concerning the way of per­fo rming activities common to the ordinary person and the yog1n�: on strength of engaging [vajra recitation] through the process of inhaling, holding, and exhaling those same three syllables, one can maintain [the practice] through making the body abide Uust by breathing OM Al:l HOM] through the day and night. At the time of sexual union, the same three syllables, together with the semen-nature ali [vowels] and ovum­nature kali [consonants], face downward and emerge from the secret nostril-hole in the form of a seed and cause the creation of a being's body. And the same [three letters] again, combined with life-energy control,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Chapter V-Speech Isolation in General · 267 going upward, cause the awakening of the sense doors such as eye. When semen and ovum merge with wind-energies and go downward, the three letters are taught intending that you cause the energy to enter and exit from the lower (dhati) tip door and also keep it in its own place. When the vitalizing energy goes upward as well, some part stays within and some goes without, after which it comes again within, hence becoming fit to be counted as the three letters. A letter with the sound of the wind­energy, has gotten the name \"together with the wind-energy.\" Having performed all the activities already explained and to be explained below in the context of dwelling in the body, at the end in death, it enters into the indestructible, and once again you rely on [getting another] ordinary body which performs all the activities previously mentioned-and the meaning of this statement has already been explained. [Second,] for the yog7n'ii in particular, there are two ways to per­form activities. The creation stage person's way to perform [13.\\al [the practice] is to create the deity body from the true application of the three letters, which here are the three letters having the form of colors and shapes. The same, having placed them in the heart center and so on in the form of letters having color and shape, you perform whispered and vocal verbal recitation, relying on an activity color and facing a direction and so on, and you accomplish activities such as the peaceful; and in this practice there are both audible and visible three syllables. The perfection stage practitioner's way to perform the practice is to make the effortless vajra recitation come out of the nostrils, and it purifies previous karmic obstructions; as the energy moves in the four elemental spheres through vajra recitation in each half-session, you acomplish mainly one of each activity of peace, prosperity, power, and terror, and incidentally [you accomplish] the other three activities-so that you accomplish both main and incidental activities. Both [creation and perfection] yog7nil use the three letters while enjoying food and drink to purify the faults of the food through the process of purifying, transforming, and expanding. In these cases also the mantras have sound and form both. Such is stated in terms of both outer and inner. However, the main thing here is [to realize] the three syllables as the very tones of the wind­energies emerging, entering, and abiding in the heart center indestruc­tible. As the Integrated Practices states:"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"268 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp One should not hesitate to engage with the mantra syl­lable having the inward nature. And each of them is also there stated to emerge from the indestructible. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTB\"4\"b\"-The symbol of mantra] The symbol of a mantra is the name £133bJ of the mantra. There are four kinds of mantras: those which have OM at the beginning and SVAH A at the end, called \"snake\"; those with OM at the beginning and no SVAH A, called \"tail-less\"; opposite to that, the \"head-less\"; and the \"collected\" kind, which have neither. Then there are many others, the essence mantra, the secondary essence mantra, and so on. Here, it is stated in the Revelation of the Hidden Intention: The three realities abide with the symbols; They have the character of a natural recitation. Therefore, it is shown that one should understand that, with the symbols, the three realities of the wind-energy-exhaling, inhaling, and abiding­abide from the beginning in the character of a natural recitation. The symbols of the three inner mantras stay the same as those three. The reality of entering is the symbol of OM. The other two should be known in the same way. In that [same] Ta ntra, it states [the mantras to be aligned with] the symbols of \"quickening, compressing, and going slow.\" Thus, when collecting the mantra to be recited in vajra recitation, the three letters emerge. When one indicates that named sign, one knows them as the letters which are the tone of the wind-energy, and those two [wind­energy and mantra] are taken to be indivisible. As the Revelation of the Hidden Intention says: When the mantri is alone without a seal, S/he does not become a person of mantra. If the mantri and the seal are not united, you will not accomplish [your aim]. Here, in the Esoteric Community, in answer to: \"If one does not employ the seal of the hand, how will one achieve just by the mantra alone?\" [the Revelation of the Hidden Intention] says: Having the three-quickness, and so on­Is explained as achieving the seal ."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Chapter V -Speech Isolation in General · 269 Here, if one does quick exhalation, compressed inner inhalation, and lei­surely holding in, along with counting, then this serves as the seal, bind­ing that [practice]: Definitely employing in mantra [practice] The quick, [134al the compressed, and the leisurely The master says it with effort Close to the ear of the disciple.

This is in order to invoke them each to do their own divine activity. That purpose is also achieved by vajra recitation. Thus, by the three recitations of inhaling within and so on, they are invited, requested to stay, and exhorted to go. This achieves the purpose.

This is the same as the four things explained in the Ta ntra: the pronunciation, the visualization, the symbol, and the ultimate reality. Further, the Root Ta ntra Second Chapter states that you should create the magic body, which is the indivisible union of the three, body, speech, and mind, in the verse, \"The body is like the mind, etc.\" In answer to the question about how to create the magic body, those two lines show how to create it. Thus, that [magic body] has the actuality of insubstantiality, and is the wind-energy-mind arisen from the clear light transparence indestructible.

In the Integrated Practices also, the way that those three letters generate all other letters is shown by those verses, which [A ryadeva] also quotes. In that quoted treatise , after showing how to concentrate all mantras in the three letters, there is a statement which says: In the short [letter], there is the totality of speech; It is not one, and it is not many. And, except for the explanation in the Integrated Practices which states that: In the short [\"A\"], there is the totality of speech ... this meaning is not explained at all in other treatises. The reason for this is that [the father and sons] intend that in order to understand the reality of mantra, it is indispensable to understand well the difference between the interpretable and the definitive about the statement that the \"short A\" is the root of all speech; and, that if one knows that, it will be easy to understand the definitive meaning of the other treatises.

The \"explainers of the Buddha's Sotras\" are all the Buddhists who explain the import of Sotras without understanding the reality of mantra, which is the definitive meaning \"short A,\" which must become attached to all speech, relying on the Explanatory Ta ntra. In the Integrated Practices, [Aryadeva] states: About the so-called reality of mantra: root Tantras such as the Reality Compendium and so forth, and the Further Ta ntra, mention only \"mantra,\" and do not teach the concentration of mantra.

Therefore, not understanding the Explanatory Ta ntra, those who insistently adhere to the outer secret mantra will never understand this.

When one collects many letters there is a name, when those are collected there is an expression, when many of those are collected there is speech, and when many of those are collected there is a treatise. That is the explanation up to there. But this is not the meaning. If that was so, the statement that those who explain Sotras according to works on grammar do not understand would be extremely incorrect. Well, what is [the meaning]? Here, the attacher is that example of what is said to be speech which has the nature of ali and kiili, which is Vairocana, who is the wind­energy of vowels and consonants. Where is that attached? It is attached to the heart center indestructible. This has already been explained previ­ously, quoting from the Integrated Practices. Why is it attached? Because by achieving the indestructible, one realizes insubstantiality. This is what the Integrated Practices says. This is because clear light transparence is interpreted as insubstantiality. How is it attached? By means of the [death or yogic] dissolution process, as by earth dissolving into water, etc. Thus, the reality of that \"short A\" letter of such three processes is only the realm of buddhas, and is kept secret from the lesser disciples, as they do not understand it. In the Integrated Practices Commentary, in the context of the passage, \"at the time of learning, getting involved in the meaning of the syllables,\" and so forth, it is explained that \"those who are not holy do not understand; like pointing at the moon with a forefinger,\" they do not see the meaning. In the process of teaching, regarding the way of making it understandable, it says \"all speech.\" This refers to all of the forty-nine letters, the sixteen vowels and the thirty-three consonants. Gradually concentrating [all speech], all the treatises, both sacred and mundane, such as the Sutras and Tantras emerge and enable one to perfect all accomplishments. [136bJ If one knows the import of the specific letters connecting such speech to words, etc., this is because \"short A\" is their life-energy, because such a letter as \"K,\" etc. which does not have the \"short A\" [which makes it \".KA\"] does not exist. Because it would simply be a stop, it would not become an expression. That explanation is the literal interpretable meaning of the expression [in Nagarjuna's Five Stages] \"the short one becomes the totality of speech.\" Therefore, just as is stated in the Hymn of the Names {of Maflju.\\:hrT }: \"A\" is the supreme of all letters.

There­fore, the Divine Lord said: The \"A\" is the door of all things, because it is unpro­duced; and it is the word, the seed of the door of all con­templations. It is also called \"the [natural] orgasmic letter.\" Also, in the Vajra Man­dala Ornament [Tantraj it is said, in order to clearly indicate 'A': it is in the center of the heart, indestructible ... etc., as quoted above.87 And just after that quote [the Integrated Practices says]: Therefore, all buddhas become the clan of \"A\"- \"A\" becomes the cause, and they are released through \"A.\" These three references are given. Taking this as a reason, [137a] it is established that all buddhas arise from \"A\"; it is not proven that all speech has short \"A.\" After that, the Integrated Practices says: In the Mission to Lanka [Satrajit says to rely on the import, but do not rely on the letter; if one goes after the letter, one will lose the ultimate meaning; furthermore, it will not cause understanding. Thus, it is like someone pointing out something to another with a fingertip and the other just looks at the fingertip; even so, foolish persons, attached to the literal meaning of things, will not be caused to seek the ultimate meaning.

This is the [Mission to Lan k� quote. If one holds just the literal meaning of showing the \"short A\" applying to all expressions, one will not find any other import represented by that. One will just be looking at the fingertip, and one will not see the meaning pointed out by that. Similarly, it means that beyond that literal meaning, one must look for another meaning. What is that [other] meaning? Here, Tibetan mentors say that all speech words arise from vowels and consonants, and all of those arise from \"short A.\" \"Short A\" arises from the clear light in the void interior of the body. Therefore, all words are like space, and have voidness as their root. Therefore, in regard to al l aggregates, etc., the import of being expressed by that sound should be understood as like space, without intrinsic reality. This is the explanation of the reality of the word. 1 137bl Our own system, according to the quote in the Vaj ra Mandala Orna­ment [Tantra], is that: \"A\" means the indestructible that blazes like a butter-lamp flame in the center of the heart. In the Hymn of the Names it is explained that \"A\" is the supreme of all letters. Other Tantras state that \"A\" is the door of all teachings; in this context, these must be explained as having the same meaning. Further, in the Integrated Practices it is stated that after death, the ground where the wind-energies dissolve is the indestructible. If one explains the definitive meaning of \"short A\" in that way, the definitive meaning of the vowels and consonants mentioned there are the wind-energies arising in depen­dence upon the subtle wind-energies of the indestructible, which wind­energies go and reside in the places within the body. This is taken as those vowels and consonants which are explained as arising in the form of vowels and consonants, and does not refer those vowels and consonants which are produced from the effort of the tongue and palate. The Samputa [Tantra] says that in the center of the eight petaled lotus of the navel the supreme syllable \"A\" abides. All mantras of all beings are said to be produced from there.

The statement \"by that energy all the wind-energies of beings are pervaded,\" and the statement \"when [an embryo] is first conceived, the life-energy is developed from the heart center, and [at the end] finally collected there\" are explained as previously as arising from the inde­structible \"short A.\" As for that, the life-energy wind which abides in the heart center and the \"short A\" is the indestructible [drop] of the spirit of enlightenment.

It has the precise measure of a grain of mustard seed, because that is the form of the drop. \"On the tip of the nose\" indicates the hub of the heart center lotus. \"Intensely\" means that you should meditate constantly day and night by focusing on it and using the yogas of inhaling, holding, re leasing, and compressing. l144hl Thus the text states that you should meditate the heart center indestruc­tible day and night through the yoga of inhaling and so on. As for the sequence of the meditations of the indestructible and the vajra recitation, the following [Illumination of the Lamp passage, coming right after the one above, teaches, in commentary on a Root Ta ntra pas­sage, namely,] \"Having made the jewel stable, one radiates, and one does not radiate without its becoming stable\"90-\"Stable\" is constant. What is that? The indestructible. From it you should massively radiate \"jewel,\" or five colored, light rays, and you should engage with it by inhaling, holding, and releasing. \"Without its becoming stable\" means that you should practice this yoga with [constant focus on] the realization of the thatness of the indestructible, and not otherwise. The meaning of this is as follows. Meditating on the indestructible drop mentioned previously in the statement that \"you should constantly meditate the indestructible by the yoga of inhaling and so on,\" you develop firmness. Thereby you should practice the yoga of making the 90 The Root Ta ntra passage and the commentary on it are in reverse order in the Tibetan texts, due no doubt to scribal error, so I have reversed the order back to make it clearer."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"290 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp wind-energies enter. etc. within [the central channel]. Thus, by any other way than by having realized the natural experience of the thatness of the indestructible and developed stability in taking the indestructible as ob­ject, you should not perform this yoga of inhaling etc. Such being the meaning, first you must stabilize a constant and unchanging meditative indestructible, and after that you can practice vajra recitation. This explanation is said by [Chandraktti in] the Illumination of the Lamp to be an ultimate [meaning] explanation. To that, a certain objector argues that this is the way of explaining the vajra recitation [only] for a person who has [already] embodied the ultimate communion. [145aJ Others do indeed explain the \"indestructible\" as the fourth stage clear light. However, from the extensive explanation of this point in the com­mentary on the [Root Ta ntra ] Third Chapter, after explaining the wind­energies of the four [elemental] spheres emerging from the indestruc­tible, the Chag translation has the statement: By achieving such a body, speech, and mind, the body and so on are created; and \"emerging from the vajra\" refers to the creation of the divine circle which has the nature of the two realities arisen from clear light trans­parence. Thus the explanation is said to be \"ultimate\" in terms of [its referring to] the objective of vajra recitation, which is the creation of communion by the wind-energies through the practice of vajra recitation. This is similar to the Se venteenth Chapter's explanation of the three voids being called \"ultimate.\" As for the place where the indestructible is meditated, its objective vital point is the hub of the heart center lotus; and it is the same in mean­ing as the Vajra Rosary's statement to meditate the mantra drop in the hub of the eight-petalled Dharma wheel [of the heart center]. Lak�hmts statement that you should meditate within the center of the heart center's avadhati [channel] is good; and it does not mean the [same thing as] the Five Point's mention of the black and white boundary in the heart, or the Four Point's mention of the empty space in the heart center. As for the dhati channel, it is stated in the Great Seal Drop and the Wisdom-Intuition Drop to be stabilized as the \"staff of the life-energy wind\" and the root of the life-energy wind. Since the hub of the heart center channel wheel is"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 291 in front of the life-energy wind channel at the height of. and in the center between, the two breasts, you should visualize it there. In regard to such reasonable instructions as this [concerning] the meditations on the drops and so on as accurately penetrating the vital points of the body, if you know well the vital points of the body, when you aim the mind there, lt4Shl it will reach those vital points; and other­wise not. As for the drop meditated in that place, the Vajra Rosary does not explicitly mention a drop other than the syllables, but the Illumination of the Lamp teaches the meditation on the indestructible in the form of a drop. In this context, some followers of the Go tradition wish to meditate the short A in the center of a drop which is an interlaced sun and moon. The Concise Five Stages teaches the meditation of the indestructible drop together with the short A In both of the personal instructions of Serding­pa, the drop is explained as white and the short A as black. In one, a half­white, half-black short A resides within a white drop; again in another a bar-shaped A resides within a half-black, half-white drop; yet another recommends meditating a white, reddish-tinged drop. As for a red-white­interfaced drop, it is in agreement with the great adept Kukuripa's state­ment [in his Vajrasattva Sadhana] about the drop used as support for vajra recitation: Visualizing in its hub A sun disc, a drop, and a moon disc, Shaped like a closed [round] shrine-box, The sun of art, and the moon of wisdom. However, here [in the Noble system], a syllable is used in place of the drop in the center of that [heart center]; the Personal Instruction explains it as a slightly reddish white. The heart center is explained to be the place where the between person's consciousness enters in the center of the semen and ovum of father and mother in the womb; and is also explained as the support of the mind. And that is the key of the basic reality cultivation foundation of both those [Noble and Jfianapada] systems of meditation. The measure of the drop is said to be just that of a mustard seed; for if you hold the mind on a subtle object, it is easy to eradicate thought constructions and compress the wind-energies."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"292 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp As for the syllable, [146aJ the Vajra Rosary mentions both A and HOM as the syllable in the heart center, and the In tegrated Practices mentions the A syllable; and they are meditated as representatives of the indestructible. Since there is something established there in the form of a syllable, there is indeed no certainty [about which one], so here one can meditate either A or HOM. In either case the color should be dark blue; or the Vo w Arisal also suggests white. Here, \"wind-energy\" stands for the indestructible, and the \"white-red drop\" stands for the indestructible enlightenment spirit. In this context the five-colored jewel is blazing with the fi ve light rays, which is proper to connect with either syllable or drop. Other traditions explain the drop as being on top of a syllable itself located on a hand symbol; but here [in this Noble system] it is better as above. Thus one should focus the mind, practicing free of the faults of holding the mind either much too tightly or much too loosely on the heart center indestructible. This is highly praised in the Liberation Drop: That brilliant form of the indestructible drop, Just the measure of a grain of mustard, Dripping and blazing with five light rays, Properly always stands in the heart center. Gazing on that, great wisdom will blaze up In the yogi/ni in just an instant-There should be no doubt about it. It is also praised in other Tantras, as in the Unexcelled Clear Articulation: Always dwelling in the heart, Unchanging in the sole drop, The person who meditates on that Will definitely generate wisdom. And from that [Tantra's] meaning commentary [by Ghar:ttapada], called the Supreme Bliss Five Stages: The mind which has the drop and the sound, 1146bl You should place it in the heart center: This will dispel the fog of delusion-You will become a master divine lord buddha."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 293 Thus depending on the meditation of the indestructible drop in the heart center, the orgasmic [wisdom] that radically cuts off ignorance will arise.

The energy moving up into the life-cycle Will progress downward into nirvana. The totally non-local nirvana Dwells in the heart-center lotus' anthers. Thus, if you can collect, stop, and stabilize the energy- by the distinctive arts such as explained above-in the center of the heart-center channel­wheel, you cannot be bound any more by the mental constructions en­gaged with objects such as form and sound, and it will grant you the exalted state of nirvana not located in the extremes of existence and peace. Again, as explained above, the twelve subject-object wind-energies are said to arise in the heart center. If you practice the art of penetrating the body's vital points and holding the mind therein, those wind-energies will compress back there, and by the key process of their dissolving there, you can easily cut off the constructions of subject and object. By such a procedure, you generate the great certitude about this that is p raised in the many treatises of the great adepts and in many Tantras.

Further [the Concise Five Stages states]: As for the wheel of mantra syllables; First, contemplate an eight petaled lotus Containing rows [of letters], In a pattern of outer, inner, and secret. [This explains] the meditation of an eight-petaled lotus with three rows [of letters on it] in the heart center. Further [the Concise Five Stages states]: The outer row is marked by wisdom-vowels, The middle row by the art-consonants, And the nondual letters stand within-This samadhi of rows in cardinals and quarters, Has the nature of the three yogas, With the indestructible drop in the center, With its A-syllable which becomes life-energy, Essence of all, radiating and gathering back. Thus, this teaches that you should meditate the outer [row on the] eight petals of the lotus as marked with the twelve vowels [which are] the actu­ality of wisdom; the middle [row on the] eight petals as marked with the consonants which are the actuality of art; and the inner [row] with the four neuter letters [.8, 8, {., Ll. which are the actuality of art and wisdom non­dual; and the center as the indestructible drop, together with a short A.91 In this regard, three [texts by Serdingpa] explain that you should meditate the mantra wheel as a preliminary of the vajra recitation: the Five Point, the Wheel Endowed, and the Five Stages Single Session. 91 The way this commentary is written, one could think that this eight-petallede heart lotus is actually 24-petalled, since it seems as if the three rows are marked each on a diffe rent row of petals. 1 believe thut is because in the short-hand way of dictating, Tsong Khapa assumes everyone know the heart lotus has only eight petals, and the letters are arranged in three rows on the eight petals, vowels near the tips of the petals, consonants in the middle, and the four neuter semi-vowels on the base of the four directional petals."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Chapter VI -Speech Isolation in Practice· 295 Though the Four Point [by Serdingpa] explains this in the context of mind isolation, in the Root Te xt [of the Concise Five Stages, attributed to Naropa] it explains that you do the vajra recitation after previously medi­tating the mantra wheel; so you should do it according to the previous three texts. Serdingpa said that the lotus petals should be red, the shape should be [convex] like an upheld mirror. l147b1 From some of the other instruc­tions of the Marpa tradition, it is explained that on the channel having a form like a lotus and which is white with a reddish tinge, the letters are white. With regard to the lotus which is the place established in the heart center for the drop which is the support of the vajra recitation, Kukuripa says that that lotus should be thought of as having the nature of the four elements, with four white petals and four red petals. This is to think of them as being the actuality of the four channels of the directions of the heart center. From some other treatises also, on the occasion of the per­fection stage, the lotuses in the navel etc., whereon are established the drop and the letters etc., are explained as \"channel-petals,\" and that is how one should take them, or else one can also visualize that the lotus petals themselves are the actuality of the channels. There being uncertainty about the color of the heart-center lotus, and there being many explanations of the eight-petaled [lotus] of the channel-wheel, it appears that there are two explanations; and a third explanation is not often found elsewhere. If you visualize it like a lotus­flower petal, then there is no point in [visualizing it] like a raised mirror. Serdingpa has the consonants established on the outer [rows on the] petals and the vowels on the middle [rows]; but this does not accord with the Root Te xt [of the Concise Five Stages]. Therefore, you should establish [them] according to what appears elsewhere in the Marpa tradition, which accords with the Root Te xt, [Naropa's Clarification of the Concise Five Stages], which says that the vowels are luminance, the consonants radi­ance, and the neuter syllables are imminence. That being the case, it is good if you make the outer letters white, the middle letters red, and the inner letters blue or black. The Root Text says \"Twelve letters having drops ... ,\" meaning that on the eleven vowels, excluding the four neuters. there is a drop, 114Hal so you should place a drop on the head of those"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"296 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp eleven. 92 It does not mean that you should accept that you place the drop in front of them, [or that] you establish them with no drop. As for the way of setting the [syllables] up, you begin from the east; and in the four directions you put two-two, then starting from the south­east in each four quarters you do one each, or else you arrange them in continuous order from the east, according to Serdingpa's instruction. The consonants are also like that. As for setting up the consonants, the Root Te xt says: From KA up to HA, leaving out KSHA, having four. This [is explained by some to] mean that one should start from the east, on five petals, and place the five sets [beginning with] KA CA TA TAPA. Then, on three petals put the YA and SHA sets [on two of them], and then, on the last petal, put the four letters KLA BLA SLA SHLA, these four being called the \"hidden,\" or \"the four tongue-rooted letters.\" But that comes from not knowing the meaning. What the text [actually] means is [that] on each of eight petals, leaving out KSHA from KA to HA, you put four. In this way, the five sets of four KA CA TA TAPA, the NGA NYA /:lA NA set of four, and the two YA and SHA sets of four are eight [sets in total]. The MA letter is the drop on the vowels. On the inner lotus petals of the four cardinal directions, 8 8. 1,.. L are placed, and the quarter petals are left empty. When you put them on the channel [of the] petals, and the letters are not alone [on that part of the petal], you set [the four consonants] sequentially in the channel [of the petal] from outer to inner, and have them standing up. If you set them in the [circular] plane of the petal itself, put them in the form of the arrange­ment of a garland. [14Hbl As for setting the indestructible in the center together with its A, it is as already explained. The Root Text says: Present in the center of the real m of space, You should visualize the brilliant mandala. 92 Tsong Khapa interprets the statement about twelve letters as referring to eleven letters, apparently meaning that the short A is in the center and not repeated in the outermost row."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 297 As for the meaning of this stated in the context of the mantra wheel. it does not mean, as some people assert, to meditate that. from within void­ness, awareness arises as a mere nada [channel] and transforms into the moondisk of the heart center. With regard to the definitive meaning of that statement in the Root Ta ntra, the Illumination of the Lamp says that the realm of space means clear light transparence and the moon disk which stands in its center is said to be the indestructible. That very [explanation] is to be applied here. because by that it is shown that the supporting body of the vajra recitation is the indestructible [drop]. As for meditating the mantra wheel in this way, except for the per­sonal instruction of Naropa. it does not occur in the treatises together with the personal instructions of the Noble tradition. In some of the instructions of the lineage from Jfianakara to Nagtso there are things disagreeing with this. Even in the instruction [manuals] of the Marpa tradition, dissimilar things sometimes appear. What is explained above, [coming from N aropa], is correct. In regard to what Serdingpa says- that the Revelation of the Hidden Intention quotes cited in the Five Stages, \"Five having truly five,\" and \"Four definitely attached in threes,\" and \"Sixteen abiding in parts, and so on,\" show the ways of establishing the letters on the petals-that is not what they mean; because, although those letters-OM A.Ij HO�are collected from the vowels, they do not show how you meditate when you place the vowels on the lotus petals. In other Tantras there are statements [to the effect that one] sets up many letters in the wheels and then meditates; [149al [thus,] they are taught in order to compress the wind-energies there; here it is similar. Thus, if, for the sake of compressing the wind-energies in the heart center, you visualize setting up letters there in the cardinal and quarter directions, you do so in order to collect the wind-energies gradually into the inde­structible; so this is just the personal instruction for doing that. In that context, first you visualize the lotus petals, and then gradually from without, in sequence, you visualize the letters of the directions and quarters and hold the mind [on them, until] the energy is collected in the indestructible. In this way, [the energies] easily go closer and closer [to the center]-that is the key to the way they teach. It is not definitely nec­essary for the mantra wheel to be very elaborate. Just as in the five stages instruction manuals of the Marpa tradition there are explanations of prac­ticing vajra recitation by establishing no wheel at all, [by visualizing] the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"2Q8 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp triply-nested spiritual heroes. all three simultaneously without any mantra wheel. [or visualizing) the indestructible drop with the short A and setting up the HOM syllable-according to [whichever of) these explanations, [you can perfonn) the vajra recitation. Nevertheless, it is definitely necessary to meditate the indestruc­tible drop together with [its] letter as explained above, [but] whether the mantra wheel is necessary depends on whether one does it extensively or briefly. For example. in the Sheaf of Instructions you establish both hub letters and petal letters in the four wheels, [although] a second way is [also] explained which requires the four letters only in the centers [of the wheels]. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd'i 'B\"6\"a\"ii \"-Meditating life-energy control of the light drop at the face nose tip) The second has two parts: [A\"') In what place and with what wind­energy does one practice the vajra recitation; and [B\"') The way of uniting wind-energy and mantra, showing the way to differentiate [various types of] vajra recitation.

If the body isolation has preceded, and if one practices the vajra recitation for the sake of achieving the [four] voids of the mind isolation, first [you practice with] the four root wind-energies; and from the point when you discover the power there, you then practice with the five branch wind­energies. On the three occasions of practicing vajra recitation stated in the text, this refers to the latter."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 299 Here, one might inquire, \"If that is the way you practice vajra reci­tation with regard to such-and-such wind-energies, is it certain or not about the place in the body about which one might say 'you should practice through this spot which is the vital point in the body\"'? In this regard, most people, except for their mere making the energy enter in and go out of the nostrils from the inner hollow of the body, have no certitude that they should practice from such and such a spot in the channel wheels of the body. Again, some people say that the four root wind-energies should be understood as residing in the four elemental spheres in the four [wheels], the throat, and so on. In regard to the first of these [two opinions]: although it allows that there exist the union of the three letters with the three [processes] of the energy-exhaling, inhaling and abiding-if you lack the personal instruc­tion which says that \"you should practice in this vital channel wheel of the body,\" however much you strive, it will not happen that the four voids will develop through the dissolving of the energy inje cted into the dhati. Otherwise, [if that were not the case,] you could not avoid the logical absurdity that by counting the exhalations and inhalations of the wind-energy as explained in the Disciples' Stages, you would get the same result. In regard to the second opinion, though it has the idea that there is a mere penetration of the vital point of the channels, it has not discovered the import of the key of how the vajra recitation of this system penetrates the vital point in the body. Therefore, in our own system, the three­inhaling, exhaling and holding- are done from the I tSOaJ indestructible drop, along with its letter, itself in the center of the heart. So, to first establish this point with the [statements from] the Illu­mination of the Lamp; compared to the previous Illumination of the Lamp quotation, giving the meaning of the passage that you should medi­tate by the yoga of inhaling, exhaling and holding, the later passage makes it more clear, and states that it is from within that indestructible drop that one should perform the exhaling, inhaling and holding of a mass of five colored light rays. Also the Illumination of the Lamp third chapter, when it explains the defin-itive meaning of the statements that \"you should draw a moon disc standing in the center of space.\"\" and \"standing in the center of the sphere of clear light transparence, you should vizualise a wheel mandala and a lotus mandala and a jewel man­dala,\" and \"you should draw a yoga mandala,\" I it id entifies I \"the sphere"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"300 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of clear transparence\" as the indestructible, \"standing in the center,\" and as arising from that; and it states that you should know the four elemental spheres that arise from that as the emerging four wind-energies of the four spheres of water, fire, earth, and wind, in that order. Again, in com­ment on the [Root] Ta ntra sixth chapter statement that you should medi­tate the four discs as standing in the middle of the realm of space-sun, clear light transparence, jewel, and light discs, \"the realm of space\" is the indestructible, ''standing in the middle\" [means] emerging from there, and the four discs that are emerging are explained as, in order, the wind­energies of the four elements. [ ISOb] It says that in those you should practice the vajra recitation of the three letters, and also that you should command with vajra recitation the Vajrasattva who dwells in the heart center. As for the explanation of the vajra recitation of the four wind­energies which is taught in the [Root Ta ntra] third chapter, [the Illumina­tion of the Lamp] explains it by quoting the Explanatory Tantra Revelation of the Hidden Intention. Especially to eliminate doubts arising from the Vajra Rosary's statement that you should perform going and coming of the four wind-energies from these four places, \"at the adam's apple, the heart center, the navel, and the lotus of the secret [center], manifest coming and going\"; the Four Goddess Dialogue states that \"the going and coming of the wind-energies\" is from the indestructible of the heart, which fits with the above-explained meaning of the Illumination of the Lamp; therefore you should understand that from the detailed analysis in the [Lamp's] subcommentary. From the Integrated Practices, it says: In the context of the vajra recitation of the three letters, mantras such as \"the snake,\" and so on, are those that arise from the vowels and consonants. The reality of those is the three letters that arise from the indestructible. This also means that the recitation of the three mantras of the vajra reci­tation should be recited by the method of coming [in and out] of the inde­structible. It does not mean that one should recite by the method of caus­ing them to enter and exit from the [central] places of the four chakras. As for the reason of needing to do it that way: as explained above, the four voids emerge from the compression of the wind-energies in the inde­structible, and the vital key of vajra recitation is that it is the means of"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 30 1 compressing the wind-energies into the indestructible of the heart center; because the principle method of causing the entrance of the three explained above such as entering, [holding, and coming out] etc. 115luJ is the vajra recitation. Therefore, Ekadashanirgho�ha explains: Coming out from the indestructible drop, which abides in the center of the lotus in the heart-center, is the exhalation, HOM. entering inhaled there is OM and held abiding there is the nature of Al:f. These depend on the color white etc. having the characteristic of the elemen­tal spheres of water etc. They occur with the process of [normal breathing] through the superficial right nostril etc. Thus you do the vajra recitation which effortlessly accomplishes the activities of pacification etc., and effects the purification of all previous dobscurations. Also, from Bhavyakirti's Five Stages Difficult Point Commentary, he correctly explains that you should do the vajra recitation of the triple process of having all four elemental spheres leave, enter, and hold within the indestructible drop. In the Root Te xt it is explained that in the cent ral indestructible, the essence of the whole body, wind-energies etc. are first radiated and then finally gathered back, so that is how you should do the vajra recitation, as it is a repetition of the [natural] process of all things arising from the indestructible [in the first place]. The Four Point explains that from that indestructible abiding in the center of the heart, you should do the recita­tion connecting the letters with the entering, leaving, and standing still of the five root wind-energies radiating in their five colors of light. That is the meaning of the Root Te xt, and also it is the ultimate key point of the practice of vajra recitation. Nevertheless, it seems there are still those who do not understand the good explanations in those texts, mainly because of their not understanding the need to know well the vital point of the heart center in this system. Some others of the Marpa tradition [151bl claim that, by visualizing in order from the outside the letters in three rows on the lotus petals, you should do the vajra recitation of the three wind-energies of entering, abid­ing and exiting in those ranks; t hinking that is the meaning of the phrase, \"the nature of three kinds of yoga.\" B ut that is incorrect, because the meaning of [the passage from Naropa's Concise Five Stages]:"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"302 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp The samadhi of the rows in cardinal and quarter directions Has the nature of the three kinds of yoga. is the actuality of the three yogas which practice the three samadhis visu­alizing three rows [of letters] in the cardinal and quarter directions. Kuku­ripa teaches that you should practice the vajra recitation of exhaling and inhaling from within the kiss of the [two halves of the] drop set in the heart center. Although the Persona/In struction [of Maiijushrr] teaches [variously] that you should practice the vajra recitation by meditating the three vajras in the center of the two breasts, in the heart center, in the throat and in the crown, [by meditating] the three letters abiding in the moon in the center of the elemental spheres of wind, water, fire, and earth standing in order in the symbol in the heart center of the meditated wisdom hero, and [by meditating] the seed-syllable of your own deity; nevertheless, you should not do it through the heart center of each individ­ual deity, but through the indestructible [in your own heart] ; as [Jfiana­pada] says, \"you should do the actual vajra recitation of the indestructible drop by these [various] procedures.\" Therefore, when the Liberation Drop says that you should practice the vajra recitation of the four wind-energies which emerge from the upper nostril as light rays radiating from the four [element] letters, [meaning that] the right side wind [element] is the body-vajra, the left side water element is the speech-vajra, and the both-together fire element is the mind-vajra, and the both-together earth element is the nature of all deities, it is explaining in that way wishing to show that those four wind-energies are the wind-energies of the fo ur elements, and l152aJ not that you do the vajra recitation by having the entrance, exit and holding go from there. It is just like [the way you should understand] the explanations, in both this text, [that you should do vajra recitation] in the nostrils with the elemen­tal wind-energies,] and in the Personal Instruction, that [you should do vajra recitation as] the inhalation, exhalation, and holding of the wind­energies as the four letters set in the heart center of the deity, and [the many other explanations elsewhere that you should do vajra recitation], apart from those two [ways]. [At least] those [two texts] are mentioning [procedures] that correspond with this [Noble] system, while other sys­tems teach that you should practice vajra recitation in the navel center."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 303 lYI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd TB\"6\"a\"ii\"B\"' -The way of uniting wind-energy and mantra. showing the way to differen tiate (various types of) vajra recitation] As for the way of uniting wind-energy and mantra, while there is the teaching of the Illumination of the Lamp that the white OM, [red A /:f. and blue HOM], having certain forms, shapes and colors, and being established in the places of the body, are [identical with] the wind­energies' being inhaled, held, and exhaled, and the symbolic meaning of the three letters is these [movements of the] three wind-energies, never­theless, it is not the case that those [symbolic] meanings of the [three letters as placed in the body etc.] are to be meditated as the [movements of the] three wind-energies. Also, this is not in the context of the vajra recitation. In the context of the vajra recitation, in [the literature] of the Noble tradition and from the Tantra, it seems that there is no explicit teaching of any sound or form of the three letters and, in regard to the reality of the energy connected with them, [no clear mention of] which energy and which tone.

Though it is a sound. if it is recited as a word, it becomes an outer speech; this is not [what Aryadeva means] in the Integrated Practices, by saying it is an inner word. Even when it is not spoken as a word, it is not a sound that is mentally thought in the form of a spoken word. Therefore, the natural sound of the three wind-energies which enter, abide and exit are here taken as the three syllables. The meaning of the expression \"uniting energy and mantra indivisibly\" is that indivisible union of the sound of the mantra with just the natural sound of the wind-energy. When you recognize that your wind-energies sound like the sound of the three letters, aiming the mind without distraction towards that [recogni­tion], you are practicing this [vajra-]recitation. And on this, even though the Illumination of the Lamp refers to it as \"mental recitation,\" you should make a clear distinction, since it is very different from the \"mental recita­tion\" which is the mental imagining of the form of the pronunciation of a word by the efforts of the palate and tongue. The meaning of \"wind­energy and mantra indivisibly united\" must be that they arise as one in mental experience; but if you do it as above, they will not arise as the same in mental experience.

To divide them according to the recited mantras, the Vajra Rosary teaches both the vajra recitation of the two letters HOM and HO and the vajra recitation of the three letters.

Therefore, just the previous three do not constitute the fu ll-fledged vajra recitation.

Why? The release of the heart channel knot is the freedom from mental constructions. It is the supreme of causes of cutting off [the instinctual constructs]; because, unless you hold the wind­energies there without moving, those wind-energies become the chief thing that moves the constructs to obscure and deprive [you of accom­plishments]. Or else, as for the other Lords, the body and speech vajras other than the mind vajra, and the places of those two, their crown and throat channel knots are [automatically] destroyed by the release of the mind vajra channel knot, [161bl which you should understand is what is meant by \"obstructed and removed.\" This refers to the key point which is taught below that when you release the heart center channel knot, by the power of that the other knots are released. The commentary [says] that \"among the three letters the HOM letter is chief, because all things depend upon the mind.\" However, that explanation [is too simplistic, and] comes from not properly discovering the definitive meaning of the three syllables. Then, [the Vaj ra Rosary Ta ntra] states: Third, you, the yogi/ni, realize The thought-free great miracle. By stopping all wind-energies, You realize [reality] in this very life. As for the \"third,\" it is the entry of the wind-energy into the place of the release of the heart center channel knot, which is the verbal meaning of the mind-vajra. As for \"realize,\" that [mind-vajra] becomes manifest to the yogi/ni. At that time, the freedom from mental constructions is a miracle, and [you should] add that you generate the miraculous orgasmic wisdom. \"Realize reality\" means that it is miraculous. As for the reason, it is because all wind-energies and thoughts cease, since you can collect them in the heart center indestructible. Here [Buddha Vajradhara] makes more explicit the reason previously explained that the heart seed is the master. That shows that compressing the wind-energies in the heart center is the great vital key for ceasing all thought constructs and the wind­energies that move them, which shows that compressing them in other channel centers does not have that much power; since this [Vajra Rosary] is the authoritative text that teaches the reason why compression in the heart center is the main practice. Then, it [goes on to] state:"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"322 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp In the center of the emanation and Dharma wheels, [The Buddha] said there are two lotuses; One of sixty-four and one of eight petals, Their blooms facing upward and downward.

The two essences of body and speech, The Ia lana and the rasana [channels]. The emanation center has sixty-four petals, and the truth [Dharma] center has eight. In regard to the fourth line, the commentary aptly states, \"they dwell like a jewel-sack,\" which means that the heart center lotus facing downward and the navel center lotus facing upward, as explained in the Samputa [Tantra], stand in a shape like a jewel-sack with its two halves joined together.

Thus, the first two lines teach the destruction of the heart center channel knot by practicing the vajra recitation for six months. The trans­lation of the commentary by Zhiwa Od and [the translator] Ra says, \"the heart center lotus goes by looking upward\"; [163a] and Darma Tsondru translates it as above. The commentary explains that the meaning of \"goes by looking upward\" is that the [jewel sack's two halves] break open their cover as they join together the [heart and navel] channel wheels, and that such opening, taking the \"lotus of the secret [center]\" as the emanation wheel, is the undoing of the binding of the jewel sack; so it does not seem to differ from the previous [translation.] The heart and navel wheels face downward and upward respec­tively, but are not united [forming an enclosure], so it is not a question of opening each of them individually. In this Tantra's teaching of the six channel wheels, the secret [geni­tal] center wheel is not mentioned; yet in the verse \"It manifests coming and going in the throat center, heart center, navel center, and secret lotus,\" a \"secret lotus\" is mentioned apart from the navel [center], which does not indicate the emanation wheel. This Tantra teaches that the vajra recitation \"opens\" the knot, \"destroys\" the knot, and \"conquers\" the knot; here again it teaches the \"destruction\" of the knot by the vajra recitation; therefore \"destroying the heart center lotus\" refers to the releasing of the heart center channel knot. \"Destroyed by looking upward\" refers to the navel channel knot. In releasing the heart center channel knot, it must happen in the sequence of the death process. The Sheaf of Instructions explains that you reverse the heart lotus upward at the time of practicing [soul] ejection, and the Great Seal Drop states: The life-energy wind in the heart center channel, When it does not function even for an instant, Its lotus is turned upside down, And in an instant it goes upward . Thus, it seems the heart lotus must be reversed upward.

The \"secret center lotus union\" refers to the knot by the rasand and laland channels uniting around the central channel. So, here it is taught that the navel and secret center's knots are released when the heart center channel knot is re leased. \"The midbrow is opened by energy\" shows that the wind-energies open the wheels' chan­nel knots, meaning that all the other channel knots are opened by open­ing that [heart center] knot. When the [heart] channel knot is re leased it cuts off the vitalizing and evacuating wind-energies' circ ulation in other channels. causing them to circulate only in the central channel dhati alone, giving rise to the unceasing stream of great bliss free of thoughts; thus it declares that the reality of mantra is realized by the vajra recitation. Those explanations, just as the Vajra Rosary repeatedly states \"you will achieve by means of the reality of mantra alone,\" and also [as] the Noble father and sons [teach], do not explain any other explicit yoga of meditation of wind-energy, but explain the vajra recitation itself. Thus it seems to be the indispensable method that grants the great certainty; and so I have explained it extensively.

In the Illumination of the Lamp it is stated that, before entering into clear light, the process of dissolving earth into water, etc., [164aJ gives rise to the five signs, mirage, etc. And it states that this happens not only on the occasion of entry into objective clear light, but also on all occasions of the arisal of the four voids, after the energy has been collected into the dhati channel and has dissolved there."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"326 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Thus. meditating on the indestructible in the heart center gives rise to the five signs. In the Persona/Instruction it says: You should set the mind in the drop. Holding your faculty there, The earth element enters into water; In tum, that water enters into fire; Then the fire enters into the wind, And the wind enters into the [subtle] mind. When your mind just enters into nondual wisdom, The signs [of dissolution] ensue. Because Vajrasattva enters [your central channel], The five signs arise, appearing Mirage-like, like smoke, Like a candle and like fireflies, And like a cloudless sky. Also, Kukuripa says [in his Vajrasattva Sadhana]: With the intention of great effort, Regard the drop of shape itself. Again, entering into that, The five or eight signs will emerge. Then you will abide in clear light, Abiding as long as you like , A day, a month, a year, etc. Then all your activities such as the aims of beings Will effortlessly be accomplished.

Since Vaidyapada explains that there are three signs [within each sign], as the false earth etc. are ready to be eliminated, slightly elimi­nated, and totally eliminated, [164bl you must understand that there are many degrees of these signs.

Further, the visions of [the signs] like moon, sun, and darkness happen at the very time of the [states of] luminance, radiance, and immi­nence. The vision of a cloudless sky is the time of the universal void. The signs such as mirage-likeness, etc., are the preliminary signals of the wisdoms of the fo ur voids being produced in your mind-stream. In the Tantras, infinite praises are lavished on the clear light of the universal void and the orgasmic joy, which, as explained above, is the yoga of bliss and void practiced by one who is expert in the way of indi­visibly uniting bliss and voidness. As for the first development of such distinctive bliss, it is definitely necessary that you gather the left and right wind-energies and dissolve them into the dhati channel. As for that [development], you will never produce it no matter how long you practice, if you lack the direct meditation on the wind-energies in paths of outer and inner life-energy control, which is the art of pene­trating the vital points in the body, and the yogas of the drops, etc., even though you have incisively determined the view of voidness and know how to cultivate it unerringly. Thus, you need definitely to meditate on what is taught in the authoritative treatises about the art of penetrating the vital points in the body. When you meditate on that, if you are one of those who wish your meditation to reach the vital point unerringly, you must definitely experience the signs which are the preliminary signals of the production of the orgasmic joy or the universal void wisdom. [16Sal And that is the key point of why so much praise is lavished on those signs. However, you should bear in mind that even when you practice only the settling of the mind in nonconceptuality, some simulation of those signs will arise. Thus it is extremely difficult to tell precisely the difference between such [simulations] and the signs which arise by medi­tating on the art of penetrating the vital points in the body-[so] you must be skillful ! As for the [genuine] signs which arise from penetrating the vital points in the body, they begin with the signs from the initial slight inward reversal of the wind-energies, which [usually] move totally outward from the doors of the senses, from their [actual] slight reversal. from their being slightly injected into the central channel. and so forth. There are many stages of distinctive [energy J reversal signs and actual [energy] reversals on the occasions when the path has become advanced."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"328 · Brilliant lllumination of the Lamp So do not be content with thinking [wrongly] that all of the benefits explained for the true [signs] fully function with the [merely] simulated signs, and, even though you have the real signs, do not be content with just having found the tip of the nose [of the full experiences]. But, under­standing clearly the lower and higher stages, you must seek the distinc­tive excellences of the highest stage. If you understand all of those procedures well, in the many treatises of the great adepts, such as the Personal Instruction of His Holiness [Maiijushri], [and the treatises of] Nagarjunapada, Kukuripa, GhaQta­pada, etc., there are statements regarding the perfection stage which explain the art of penetrating the vital points in the body such as energy, drop, and letter visualizations, statements that you must definitely gener­ate wisdom meditating on the drop in the heart center, and statements that there is no doubt that you will blaze with wisdom. Finding the mar­vellous certitude from these, [ I6SbJ you will develop the resolve from your heart to make these practices your essential [purpose]. People of inferior discrimination who don't understand this accurately, do not understand the key points of the Tantras by means of the instructions of the great adepts, practice the perfection stage as a partial meditation on voidness, and even though they might try out numerous samadhis properly described in those [treatises], they tend to think that \"This is not the supreme perfection stage,\" and then, [tragically,] they take a false path as the essence of their lives. Therefore, since the unerring voidness is extremely difficult to real­ize, and the Tantras and adepts' treatises are very deep when it concerns the extraordinary bliss, very hard to subtly understand, it seems that uniting bliss and void is extremely difficult. Nevertheless, if you know their vital points roughly and do not mistake their distinctive arts, you will correctly develop great bliss by the power of cultivating them. Even meditating only that is an extremely wondrous samadhi, very different from other things claimed to be profound. About the vision of the cloudless sky, the fifth sign, two types arise; one from the meditation which depends on the personal instruc­tions on how to penetrate the vital points in the body and another from mere one-pointed samadhi meditation without those [instructions].

Thus, the meanings [of the two types of arisal] are different. IIM11) Now some fo llowers of the Marpa school have said that there is no certainy about the precise arrangement of the eight signs and the aware­nesses holding the signs. Nevertheless, the intention of the treatises is that they should arise in a certain way. And it seems that they do arise in that way for those who have incorporated the vital points of the art of compressing the wind-energies. Now if you understand well the key point of meditating the indestructible in the heart center and you meditate on it for a long time, from the time when you first generate the wisdom of the four voids, it is called the \"simulated mind isolation.\" Thus from that point of view, though it is fine to call it \"mind isolation,\" it is not mind isolation true to its definition. Further, as for that, there are the two arisals of the four voids, in the emergent order and in the reverse order; and of those, the former is easier and the latter is a bit harder. As for that [arisal] of the four voids, you must let [the process run its course], just as long as you stay steady in each [void].

As Kukuripa says [in his Vajrasattva Siidhana]: At the time you arise from that samadhi, Do not think of some other thing, But always hold [yourself as] that same drop. By that artful method, once you compress the wind-energies and dissolve them into the dhati channel, you get the ability to generate the four voids. When you visualize [yourself as] a drop, compressing the wind-energies is very easy; without spending a long time at it, you are able to develop the four voids.

When the four wind­energies of wind, fire, earth and water move, and you bind them within without allowing them outside, respectively then, without any harm to yourself, you will fly in the sky, you will not be hurt by outer cold, you will not be pushed around even assaulted by a champion wrestler, and so on; and finally you will not be hurt by fire, etc. [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd'i'B\"6\"c\"ii\"B\"'-How to make the wind-energies dissolve into the central dhuti channel by vajra recitation I As already explained, when you practiced the recitation that indi­visibly connects mantras and wind-energies, you experience not mere imagination, but an intense mind-transforming feeling where in your mind the wind-energies' tones resound as the three sylllables� just as, for example, [169aJ the creation stage practitioner first has to accustom him­self or herself to meditate by imagining the deity, but later his or her mind does not have to be expressly contrived but naturally transforms itself into the pride of the deity. When that happens [in vajra recitation], you can terminate both perception and conception of the difference between energy and mantra; and furthermore, having recited with the entry, exit and holding at the level of the center of the dhati channel, by the key [practice] of the energy and mind functioning in unison, you can make the wind-energies move directly through the dhati channel. Here again, while first you have to construct this on purpose and make the wind­energies enter and exit in such a way, when you become accustomed to it, conditioned by your vajra recitation, you have experienced the properly defined injection of the wind-energies there [in the central dhati channel]. As for the sign of that [happening], when you have not practiced vajra recitation, the [wind-energies] move in each of the left and right nostils. When you practice vajra recitation, before very long the wind­energies definitely begin to be drawn into an equal flow, as the vajra recitation merely injects the wind-energies there [in the central channel]. You should understand that this also [happens] when you meditate on the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"336 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp subtle [drops] in the lower [genital center] door and in the heart center. Although thus you may have the mere ability to inject the wind-energies into the dhati channel, the problem with having only a slight bit of practice is that before long it will migrate to each of the left or the right nostrils. If you have a practice. as already explained, of injecting [the energies there] and making them enter and exit, and the heart center channel knot little by little has become slightly looser, then finally you become able to release the heart channel knot. Now here you might suspect, \"well, although it can happen that the vajra recitation practiced within the dhuti channel depending upon the vital point of the heart center can allow the wind-energies to be injected into the dhati channel and the channel knot to become looser, the vajra recitation is incapable of stopping the energy in the central channel; because vajra recitation is set up as having the function making the wind­energies go in and out without stopping. [169hl Therefore, if you lack the stopping of the exit and entry of the wind-energies by holding them compressed together within, your vajra recitation is unable to cause the energy to dissolve into the dhuti channel.\"100 It is true that such doubts arise for those who are satisfied with some biased [understanding] of the perfection stage, who in general do not understand how to compress the wind-energies by the yogas of the drop etc. as explained in the authoritative treatises, and in particular who do not know the literature of the Community which explains all the keys of that [dissolution process] emphasizing vajra recitation. However, there is no such fault [in this system of vajra recitation]. When, as already explained, you have become accustomed to the vajra recitation which equalizes the three [movements], entering, holding, and exiting, of the wind-energies, though you do not purposely cause them to hold still at a certain threshold, the wind-energies stand still on their own momentum. Their [stillness] gets longer and longer, and then, though you do not purposely block the inhalation and exhalation of the wind-energies, they become shorter and shorter. So when you first practice, in the process of 100 This refers to the vase breathing called kumbhaka. What it means is you take the up­ward energy and the lower energy and unite them at the navel center or heart center or wherever and hold them there, one pressing up and one pressing down in the central channel."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Chapter VI-Speech Isolation in Practice· 337 breathing naturally you do not need to purposely lengthen exhaling and inhaling, but still, anyway, when you work on vajra recitation, the in and out movement of the wind-energies will eventually stop completely and [the wind-energies will] stay within. Thus, further, the Revelation of the Hidden Intention [Tantra] declares: By [such a] sign, [wind-]reality stays [all] three, The nature of natural recitation; Nameless and inexpressible, This is supreme enlightenment spirit. Those very three become one, And neither go nor come. This teaches that, after having practiced the recitation as wind-energies of the spirit of enlightenment, with the realities of mantra and energy indivisibly united, being the natural recitation inexpressible in naming words, the three [energy-movements], inhalation, exhalation and holding still, [I70aJ become a single experience without any separation; and then there are no more going out and coming in of wind-energies. In that [same] Ta ntra, it states that \"the spirit of enlightenment becomes wind-energy,\" and this means that here the spirit of enlighten­ment is wind-energy. In that Ta ntra, it states that the reality of wind­energies entering, exiting, and abiding becomes of one experiential taste, and thus the other [Tantras] have a similar meaning. The Vaj ra Rosary also states: By practicing vajra recitation, Knowing its own nature, You cut off the instinctual wind-energies. This means that the vajra recitation stops the movement of wind-energies. And again: At the nine sense doors, All of them are totally bound, Repeating HOM, become incomparable! This states that vajra recitation binds the wind-energies within, not letting them move out from all doors such as the upper and lower nostrils, etc."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":".HR · Brilliant Illumination of tht• Lamp As for the meaning of those Vajra Rosary statements, the Per.mnal fm;truction I of MaiijushrT J states: Then you exhale with HO M. Collect with OM, hold with AH, And holding still the reality therein, You discover the intuitive wisdom, Free from inhaling, exhaling and holding, And you need have no doubting ambivalence. Thus it very clearly states that by practicing vajra recitation from the dis­solution of the wind-energies getting free of the threefold inhaling, ex­haling and holding, you attain wisdom, and about that there need be no doubt or ambivalence. Here you might wonder, \"Well, how do you get the energy to dis­solve within by the vajra recitation of two letters?\" By practicing that [vajra recitation], injecting the energy into the dhati channel and releasing the channel knot is similar to [the same pro­cess with] the three letters. So then the energy finds the path to go to its own root place, [I70bl and it enters into its own place, as in the time of death. The Tantra explains the two kinds of vajra recitation, while the Noble father and son set forth the vajra recitation with the three letters just as an example. The Personal Instruction states that not only can you be liberated from both inhalation and exhalation, but also you are liber­ated from holding; what that means is that you need first to reverse the moving of the exhalation and inhalation and to hold the energy within, and then you have also to dissolve the holding within. By practicing recitation of exiting and entering you reach the non­moving of energy, and since there is a type of non-moving under the influence of depression, you must be able to tell them apart. When you stop the nostril movement of energy, if it stays within without dissolving [into the central channel], then the body will seem to be inflated; but this is eradicated when it dissolves. As already explained, when the definite signs of the energy entering the dhati channel by its own force occur, and the energy naturally stays within for a long time and then dissolves into the dhati channel, what arises is like what is taught about [the four] voids. On dissimilar occasions, although there is an inner dissolution, it is not a dissolution into the dhati channel, and so [the experience] will not match what is taught about the voids.

As the Vajra Rosary says: \"Little by little, free of effort\"- and what is meant there is that you should not make a strenuous eff ort [to force] the wind-energies to enter and exit [the heart center]. [t7ta] The Personal Instruction also says that when you cause the energy to abide within, you should hold it very gently. The vajra recitation [should be] performed gently with the three, exhaling inhaling, and abid­ing wind-energies, as it is highly critical that, when the wind-energies begin slightly to stop, the elements of the body are not disturbed and remain balanced. The production of those excellent virtues which must be produced [only] through penetrating the vital points in the body is different from other [kinds of] productions. 102 Thus [penetrating the vital points precisely] is extremely necessary for extreme power in developing the voids, for ease of gaining greatly increasing impact from the moment of the first time of developing the voids, and for the great stability of your bliss and [furor] heat, and so on.

Here also, though there is a bit of intensity [used in practicing] the wind-energy yoga of vajra recitation and in cultivating by aiming your visualization at the drop etc., if you use the forceful yoga for such as meditating energy compression, it is said to cause untimely death. And though it seems to have the benefit of slightly greater speed, you should be careful to keep it within bounds.103 I previously quoted Kukuripa say­ing that the signs arise from meditating on the heart center drop, intend­ing the signs of the vajra recitation, so here the signs such as mirage will arise. Until you have well released the heart-center channel knot, l17tbl you will not attain the actual voids of mind isolation. Nevertheless, it seems that those on lower stages will definitely experience voids con­forming to [those of the] mind isolation; so you should carefully differen­tiate these [two kinds, actual and conformative]. If you do not distinguish between them, you might hold the three voids developed by vajra recita­tion on the lower stages to be the actual mind isolation, the fourth void to be the fourth stage clear light, and the two arisals in deity bodies after those two to be, [respectively,] the third stage magic body and the fifth stage communion body. Thus you will become excessively proud of such attainments when you have not really attained any of their excellent qualities, and you will lose your drive to attain the higher excellences not already attained. Then, since you have none of the distinctive transforma­tions coming from them, some of you might generate a false view and think, \"I attained a path such as this, but did not experience any sort of benefit of that atainment such as light rays; so these teachings are just words!\" And some of you might think, \"Relying on the fact that, in the literal texts of the treatises of the [Noble] father and sons, not much is taught about the arisal of the voids of the path until the attainment of mind isolation, so until then the voids of the path will not arise [for me]\"; and so you will not make effort in the methods of producing those and you will lose out on the great purpose. 103 He emphasizes the gentleness of this practice with this warning, that if you do energy compression with a power yoga, it can be fatal; so even though it might be quicker, you should be skillful about knowing the limits."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Chapter VI -Speech Isolation in Practice· 34 1 Therefore, by meditating the perfection stage and dissolving the wind-energies into the dhati channel, you generate the four joys and the four voids, without having to consider this a very advanced path.

Rather they are to make sure that you know how not to let the compression of the wind-energies become difficult somewhat later, and moreover how to dispel any failure to inject the previously compressed wind-energies into the central dhati channel- this is then to be an expert. Therefore if you practice according to the two former systems, it seems that while it might happen that you might alleviate the shooting pains of compressing wind-energies, it will not benefit your injecting the previously compressed energies into the dhati channel. The third method of dispelling [obstructions] can still work well with the forceful yoga, but our own system is that you must perform [the practice] with the gentle yogas as the [best] method of dispelling [obstruc­tions], not using the forceful yogas at all. Thus, as for [my composing] this detailed explanation of the vital points of the vajra recitation: though there seem to be very many ways to perform vajra recitation given in the oral instructions, nevertheless, since the literature of the Esoteric Community explains vajra recitation exhaus­tively in ways which are not present in other Tantras or treatises, since it seems that good explanations of the system of the Esoteric Community are rare, and since the Noble father and son do not explain the other wind-energy yogas but explain this one quite a lot, [I have written this] in order to interpret decisively [their explanations]. 109 One place in Tsong Khapa's Collected Works where this is somewhat explained is in the Zhu Lan bDud rTsis Snying po, a text recording the 1399 CE conversations between Tsong Khapa and Lhodrak Namkha Gyaltsen, wherein the dispersal of the neuralgic pains that can come from some kinds of wind-energy meditations is extensively discussed.

All three references, cited as reasons why one who wants to learn the [I77aJ mind isolation must seek the reality of the mind, teach the need to experience the reality of the mind. Thus they refute certain Tibetan and Indian [scholars] who claim that the mind isolation wisdom knows the subjective mind and does not know the reality of the mind, since if it did, it would become indistinguishable from [the later stage of] clear light [wisdom]. While the fourth stage clear light wisdom directly experiences the reality of the mind, mind isolation [wisdom] knows that ultimate reality without fully experiencing it; hence they are not indistinguishable. Although the [above] three supporting references from a Sutra and the two lower Tantras do not indicate the three mind isolation wisdoms, they still serve as reasons for the need to realize the reality of the mind.

Though the old translation of the Integrated Practices says \"sphere of mental construction,\" the Chag translation is better, translating \"mental construction the sphere of buddhas.\" [177b] [The Integrated Practices] goes on to quote the Inquiry of Bhadra­pala, [the Consciousness Migrating Satra], showing that consciousness, even when taking a body and entering lower birth-places, is not polluted by their faults; that wherever consciousness migrates, its evolutionary fruition, the sensations of pleasure and pain, also migrates; and that one who does not see the truth does not know that consciousness, abbreviat­ing the meaning by saying that: Thus consciousness has a nature free of color, sign, and shape, said to be sheer introspective wisdom in the Uni­versal Vehicle Siitras. \"The sphere of buddhas\" refers to the ultimate reality of mind. The dem­onstration of its being the root of all refers to its natural pattern of sub­jectivity. It is taught as entering various birth-states without change in its reality, and as not experientially knowable by any non-noble person. Thus, that mind is declared ultimately to be devoid of all signs, conven­tionally colorless, shapeless, not depending on other means of knowing, and sheer knowledge, itself knowing its object. As for the way it is described in the Vajra Ve hicle, the same text [the Integrated Practices] continues: The Divine Lord declared in words found in all the Tan­tras, \"That mind investigated as the buddha-sphere is in reality rootless, placeless, groundless, signless, shapeless, colorless, transcending the senses, and beyond the scope of the dogmatists.\" This refers to (J7tlal an import shared with the Transcendence Vehicle about the actuality of that mind, investigated in the context of learning mind isolation, and not to mind isolation [itself]."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"354 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [Nagarjuna] states, in the Reason Sixty: The world seems to be illusory, Placeless, imperceivable, Rootless, non-enduring, Originated from the cause of ignorance, Abandoning beginning, middle, or end, Coreless like a plantain tree, Like a city of fairies, An intolerable city of delusion.

This exaltation must be attained through other paths [only] after many immeasurable eons, but is attained in a single lifetime on the path of the Unexcelled. As for this special distinctive speed, is because of [this path's] being practiced after orgasmic great bliss has ascertained the import of reality. As the Samputa [Tantraj states: Thus what need is there for lengthy explanations. In brief, buddhahood is [usually] gained After millions of immeasurable eons; [But] you, by means of noble bliss, Will attain it in this very life. As for the mere termination of addictive obscurations, it can be attained by some [Individual Vehicle] disciples in three lifetimes, and the experiential realization of the import of reality is common to both vehicles. Thus, this distinction of speed does not just concern the speed of liber­ation from the life cycle through the speed of experientially realizing voidness. Therefore, this path requires an extreme speed in terminating cognitive obscurations. In that regard, [179a] according to the Transcendence Vehicle, if you lack the dimension of art in practicing the infinite different clear catego­ries of the infinite stores [of merit and wisdom], even if you understand penetratingly the view of voidness and meditate however so much, except for becoming free from the life cycle, you cannot terminate the cognitive obscurations. Hence, Universal Vehicle persons' developing such infinite stores over long times is for the sake of turning that realization which understands voidness into the means for terminating the cognitive obscu­rations. On the Unexcelled path, though you do not, as in the case of the Transcendence Vehicle practitioners, develop the infinite different clear categories of the stores, it is declared that your [progress] is extremely swift, since you meditate on the incisive import of voidness by means of the orgasmic bliss. Thus it is by the key point of the distinctive subjectiv­ity of great bliss that you can u nderstand that the purification of the cognitive obscurations, which constitute the instinctive dualistic error about the realization of voidness, is so very accelerated. Therefore, in"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"356 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp this path's initiation and first stage with their auxiliary rites, the declara­tions of great praise about its excellence, distinctive from other paths, are not just gratuitous, but aim to establish receptivity for the path of the union of bliss and void and serve as means of developing the fulfilment of that [union]. Now the proof of the supreme distinctiveness of speed on the path of bliss and void in union turns on the understanding that venturing upon it provides an extraordinary cause of attaining the buddha matter body, which [extraordinary cause] is recognized as a substitute for the infinite different clear categories of the store of merit. [179bJ Further, that [extra­ordinary cause] is none other than the magic body, hence you will not find the keys of both [Father and Mother] Tantras completely until you become expert in both perfection stages, that of the void-side great bliss and that of the vision-side magic body. [Here,] the Community explains: Formerly, before as many eons as subatomic particles in incalculably many buddhaverses, from the time when the Buddha Diparilkara passed away until the time of the Buddha Kashyapa, the great secret was not taught, since the beings during those times had no fortune to learn the import of the great secret. However, that enlightenment which is not attained by those bodhi­sattvas, even though they strive and seek for as many eons as grains of Ganges' sand, is attained in one single lifetime by those bodhisattvas who delight in the Community. As for the meaning of the reason for that, the Illumination of the Lamp states: During that time, the beings aspired for the inferior goal, they educated themselves by means of the passionless teaching, giving gifts, being moral and so forth, and their minds were afraid of the teaching of the profound. Thus they had no fortune, and [the buddhas] did not explain the import of the great secret during those times.

If you unite bliss and void by the art that fully incorporates void and bliss, you can [still] feel fear about its bestowing enlightenment in this life, though you have no fear about voidness alone. As for the cause of fearing that conduct that is passionate and skilled in art, granted that it is also a weak­ness of passion, mainly [that cause] is the [erroneous] idea that since the fruit of buddhahood has boundless excellence, it is suitable [to attain] after infinite different clear categories of stores and time, and is not suitable without them; and that. since the great treasures of excellence who reside on the high stages are required to spend a long time, a statement about attainment in a short time. a lifetime or so, is in order to attract certain disciples, and is not to be taken literally. Even among those who have great faith in this path and in voidness, two ways of proceeding must be distinguished, beneficial and faulty; you must get clear the arrangement of the two paths, seeing the distinctive means of attainment, and then, with intense aspiration, it is very important that you firmly determine [yourself to wield] the extraordinary ability of the type of person suited for this path. The teaching- that the mind isolation wisdom's realization of the reality of the mind and its experience of the superficial magic body are extremely difficult to find on any other path- is put forth from the wish to teach as an extraordinary path the process in which the mind isolation of great bliss- derived from meditating the above-explained three life­energy controls- meditates the reality of the mind and achieves the magic body. 1180bl As for the statement that, without entering upon the great Yoga Tantras such as the Community, you will not see the superfi­cial reality even for many eons, it rejects the claim that the superficial magic body is a samadhi that realizes the nonreality in apparent things, and the claim that it is the mere nonreality of the appearance of the deity body. I will explain below how other paths do or do not bring you ulti­mately into this process and the reasons for those [results]. lVI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'd'i'c\"4\"-Teaching the Tantra's import, the three lumi­nances and the instinctual natures] The fourth has three parts, explaining: [a\") Luminance; [b \") The instinctual natures; and [c\"] How to generate luminance intuition."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"358 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp lvl 8 3 b .. -·�'d\"' '\"4\" \" L . ] . . .. n.c ,;, 1 (. a -ummance The first has two parts, explaining: [i \") Synonyms of the three luminances; and [ii \") Definitions of each of the three luminances. lVI.8.3.b.ii.c'3 'dTc\"4 \"a 'T'-Synonyms of the three luminances] The Integrated Practices mentions two kinds of synonyms of the three luminances, those in common with the Transcendence Universal Ve hicle, and those uncommon, of renown in the Vajra Vehicle only. [Synonyms in Common with the Transcendence Universal Vehicle] The first are the synonyms \"art\" and \"wisdom,\" clearly mentioned by the Teacher, and the third, \"neuter,\" which is implied. Also \"mind,\" \"mentality,\" and \"consciousness\"; and \"imaginary,\" \"relative,\" and \"perfect\"; and \"lust,\" \"hate,\" and \"delusion\"; and the \"three realities.\" Here, \"art\" is \"radiance,\" \"wisdom\" is \"luminance,\" and \"neuter\" is the concentration of both [in] \"imminence.\" In regard to bliss and void, it is said that luminance has the stronger [ISla] awareness of void, radiance the opposite, and imminence has a balanced proportion. However, this does not indicate that all sets of art, wisdom, and their combination refer to those three. That also is in terms of the three luminances of the path, the three basic reality luminances also being termed the same, from [the fact of] their aspects being similar. As for calling luminance \"mind,\" radiance \"mentality,\" and immi­nence \"consciousness,\" there is no indication that those three correspond [directly] to these three. And further, \"mind,\" \"mentality,\" and \"conscious­ness\" are not considered mutually exclusive as are the three luminances. In some other treatises, based on equating \"mind\" with fundamental con­sciousness, \"mentality\" with addictive mentality, and \"consciousness\" with the sixfold fu nctioning consciousness, they seem to explain lumi­nance as functioning consciousness, radiance as afflictive mentality, and imminence as the fundamental. But this seems incorrect. For, if you claim that radiance and imminence are the afflictive mentality and the fu nda­mental consciousness, then the two [claims] would have the imperative consequences that an alienated individual could ascertain as manifest a fundamental consciousness and an afflictive mentality as different from the sixfold consciousness; [which is] not [possible]. And then there would be the extreme incongruity of positing perceivability for luminance and"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Chapter VII-Mind Isolation· 359 lack of perceivability for the other two. And then it would contradict the frequent explanations of the new generation of the luminances by the path of outer and inner life-energy control. Finally, if you adopt [this theory] because there are occasional reasons to apply the 'name \"fundamental\" [to the luminances etc.]. then, as that also is not taught, 118thJ it is also incorrect. Well then, how is it? In general, in the discourses it is stated that mind, mentality, and consciousness in general are the root of all purificatory practices. Thus, as he wished to teach a special set of the three, mind, mentality, and con­sciousness, as serving as the root of all purificatory practices, [Nagarjuna etc.] applied the terms of those three to the three luminances. As Arya­deva quotes the Wisdom Vajra Compendium in the Integrated Practices: Consciousness emerges from clear light. That very thing is called \"mind\" and \"mentality\"; and it has the root of all things whose nature is afflictive and purificative. As the Vaj ra Rosary states: Having the nature of the three luminances, Who here learns of the three consciousnesses, This is the root nature Of the entire realm of living beings. As for calling the three luminances \"consciousness,\" as \"mind\" and \"mentality\" are similar, each of the three luminances can be called by all three names. But as for calling the three luminances individually by one of those three terms, they should be assigned in terms of temporal sequence corresponding to the homogeneity of mental consciousnesses. As for the verbal meaning, [luminance] is called \"mind\" because of its accumulating, [radiance] \"mentality\" because of its serving as support, and [imminence] \"consciousness\" because of its dependence. Those [three functions] are completely present in all three luminance minds, they do not differ in intensity, nor can they be differentiated according to such etymologies. From the Five Stages, [Nagarjuna] states that luminance is the rela­tive, radiance is the imaginary, and imminence is the perfect. [182aJ Such an explanation realizes [luminance as] the apparent ground of perception of dichotomous subject and object, as the relative; the reification of"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"360 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp substantial subject-object-dichotomy as the imaginary, and the changeless as the perfect. And in the face of that, one should analyze, thinking \"Is it luminance that is the ground of the beginning of the voids as isolated from both the imaginary and dualistic appearance? Is it radiance that emerges as based on that? A nd is it imminence when both the above are abandoned? Are they [so designated] depending on such corresponding properties of the interpenetration of art and wisdom?\" As for calling luminance \"anger,\" radiance \"lust,\" and imminence \"delusion,\" it is from the perspective of their functions as slight bliss, big bliss, and medium bliss; and their states at times of basis and path are as above. As for the names of the three realities, as the three natures are already explained, it is not that [same set of] the three realities. Thus the reality of the void side and that of the vision side, and the reality of the two in equality [is referred to] as above explained. In the Transcendence Vehicle, there is no assignation of such names to the three luminances; so while the names designated are common [to both vehicles], such designation of the three luminances by those names is not common. [Uncommon Synonyms, of Renown only in the Vajra Vehicle] Second, [they are called in the Integrated Practices] luminance, luminance-radiance, and luminance-imminence; voidness, extreme void­ness, and great voidness; mind, mental functions, and misknowledge; dispassion, passion, and medium passion; (J82bJ and: And: OM is the cause of confirming [luminance intuition,] the seed using the door of speech; since those beings of little faith will not understand the Transcendent Lord's inten­tional statements, they will visualize it as \"the form of a moon disc,\" and as \"the clear form of the superficial reality of the mind in the actuality of \"softness,\" or \"lotus,\" \"female form,\" \"left,\" and \"night.\" A/;1 is the cause of confirming [radiance intuition,] the seed using the door of speech; since those beings of little faith will not understand the Transcendent Lord's inten-"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"And: Chapter VII-Mind Isolation· 361 tional statements, they wiJl visualize it depending on a solar disc, in the form of the superficial reality of mental function in the actuality of \"roughness,\" as a \"five point vajra,\" \"jewel,\" \"day,\" \"male form,\" and \"right.\" [HOM,] the perfect, [as the cause of] confirming [luminance-imminence intuition,] the seed using speech, is luminance-imminence. So it is stated. In the Chag translation it is stated: \"Depending on [short] A, the seed of speech.\" Thus, it is incorrect to take the three voids as the realities of the three luminances but not as the three luminances themselves, just because it is said that \"the three voids are the serial dissolutions of the three lumi­nances.\" For, the Integrated Practices states that the three luminances themselves are the three voids, and that very fact is clear in the Wisdom Vaj ra Compendium. Therefore, the three luminances are called: \"luminance,\" since it is perceived as like moonlight after the dissolving of the imaginative thought moving wind-energy, (l83a] and that same [luminance] being void, devoid of the eighty imaginations together with their wind-energies; \"luminance-radiance,\" since it is very brilliant like sunlight, being extreme void, devoid of luminance with its wind-energy; and \"luminance­imminence,\" since it is perceived extremely indistinctly like a [night-] between-time dark fog, close to clear light, and is a great void devoid of radiance with its wind-energies, or \"ignorance,\" since it is not clear, [\"ignorance\"] naming an aspect of imminence. Here, \"the door of speech\" refers to the path through which speech emerges; the seed produced depending on that constitutes the three syllables. The \"cause that confirms them\" [means] that the three terms cause the ascertainment of the three intuitions. From the Five Stages: The name of the left is that very one. Having the moon disc and lotus, Serving as cause of the confirmed, The first letter with a drop [OM]."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"362 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp And also: Likewise. with the name of vajra, Adorned by two drops [AH], Know that very thing in that part. Thus the luminances have meanings illustrated by the verbal signs of those letters. As for \"those of little faith,\" coming to perceive them depending on sun and moon, it refers to the creation stage person, who cannot accomplish the development of the magic body from the three intuitions as can the perfection stage person who has attained the mind isolation. So here the symbol \"moon\" means luminance, \"vajra\" means radiance and so forth, and imminence, the union of mind and mental functions of luminance and radiance, [is symbolized by] the union of moon and vajra etc., which means [it causes] the creation of the deity body. From the Five Stages: Just this reality of wisdom, l183b] Is imagined as a pure moon disc; The mind just sees itself, Just itself in the form of a m oon.

By uniting wisdom and art, The deity form is born. Here the fifth line is better in the Chag translation: \"From perceiving the full moon, etc.\" As for referring to the first two luminances by the words \"moon\" and \"sun,\" \"day\" and \"night,\" it comes from the sky appearing to be filled with moonlight and sunlight. Referring to them by \"lotus\" and \"vajra,\" \"female\" and \"male,\" \"left\" and \"right,\" is in terms of their referring to art and wisdom. As for \"soft\" and \"rough,\" it relates to inferior and not inferior blisses, and to objective appearance being exten­sive and not extensive."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Chapter VII-Mind Isolation· 363 As for \"superficial form\" expressing the moon etc., being symbols of the two intuitions, it is the nature of the \"artificial.\" As for luminance­imminence, it is signified by names such as \"neuter,\" \"day-night­boundary,\" \"left-right-between,\" \"soft-rough-between,\" \"wisdom-art­commingled,\" and \"moon[-sun] and day-night-combined.\" [VI.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTc\"4\"a\"ii''-Definitions of each of the three lumi­nances] [Aryadeva states] in the Integrated Practices that: The concise definition of the three luminances stated in the Wisdom Vajra Compendium is to be taught as the mentor's precept. Regarding that statement [in the Ta ntra, Aryadeva says]: And, And, If you ask \"What is the definition of luminance?\" [we reply:] its nature is formless, [I84a1 without body or speech; it is like a taintless autumn sky filled by the illumination of light rays from the moon disc, perceived in the form of natural clarity in all things- this is the ultimate spirit of enlightenment, the first void, the wisdom-luminance. \"What is the definition of luminance-radiance?\" That has the form of freedom from subject and object, and is without body and speech; being the perception of all things in the reality of extremely bril liant taintlessness, like the autumn sky flooded with sun rays, it is the second spirit of enlightenment, the total goodness, hav­ing the character of the second stage, that of extreme void. \"What is the definition of luminance-imminence?\" It has the form of nothingness, the character of space, lacking body and speech; as if pervaded in a state of fog­bound-midnight, subtle and selfless, motionless, with no"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"364 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp movement of life-energy control; without mind, un­wavering and ... In this system, a proper determination of the four voids is very im­portant, yet although the Root Ta ntra and the other four Explanatory Ta ntras frequently mention just their names, their identifications are very unclear. And the Wisdom Vajra Compendium does not describe them otherwise than just mentioning them as \"ignorance-darkness,\" \"mental­function-sunlight,\" and \"mind-moonlight.\" Further in the other treatises of the other four [of the Noble] father and sons, the identification is very [184bl unclear. So it must be understood relying on the Integrated Prac­tices itself. While the Wisdom Vajra Compendium explains the three voids as the stages of the reverse process from the clear light of death, the In te ­grated Practices explains the voids of path-time in common [with the luminances]. Thus, the four voids are shown as symbolized by the example of clear sky, and since the autumn is the time when there are many condi­tions, such as the summer rains having controlled the earth's dust from rising into view and such as the lack of obscuring clouds, the autumn sky is taken as the example. In daytime that clear sky is filled with sunlight; it is filled with thick, black darkness from evening until the night dark­ness clears [at dawn]; it is filled with moonlight from moon-rise until dawn; and it is free of these three causes of deviation from the sky's own color in the pre-dawn when moonlight is gone and sunlight is not yet arisen. These are the four occasions. As the latter of them is the example of the fourth void, universal void, [let us] leave it aside for the moment. The first of the three examples applies to radiance, the second to imminence, and the third to luminance. When those three intuitions arise, experiences like those three skies dawn. In the context of the third, in place of \"having the form of nothing­ness,\" the Chag translation is better \"in the nature of formlessness,\" as corresponding to the first definition. And that has the same meaning as the \"free from I IK!ial subject and object\" in the second definition. Further, except for the dawning as in the three modes of perception explained above, it means that all other coarse, dualistic perceptions have declined in that state. In all three, \"without body and speech\" refers to the lack of physical movement and verbal expression in that time. From \"just as ... \""},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Chapter VII-Mind Isolation· 365 up to \"like ... \" is already explained. \"The character of space ... \" applies to \"like dark fog fi lling the sky.\" \"Perceived in the form of natural clarity\" refers to the clear arisal of that objective appearance [of luminance]. and \"extreme clarity\" refers to even greater clarity than before. \" Perceived in all things\" means that the objective luminance pervades all directions and quarters; and the scope of the perception comes out as appropriate. \"Actual ultimate spirit of enlightenment\" refers to the intuition of path-time bliss-void-union, metaphorically designated also upon other paths and also basis-time. As imminence becomes unconscious, it does not experience bliss-void-union, but it is not that imminence lacks that in general. \" Subtle\" refers to difficulty of realization, and \"selfless\" to having the form of intrinsic realitylessness. \"Life-energy control not occurring\" refers to the lack of respiration. Although those traits are present in all three, they are mentioned about imminence by predominance. For \"free of mind\" the Chag translation of \"samadhi unmoved by unconsciousness itself' is preferable. Thus, when the wind-energies that move the imaginations dissolve, the sign of lamp-flame occurs, and [185bJ the luminance that arises next is a pure voidness, very clear like a clear night autumn sky pervaded by risen moonlight, arising in the form of a white luminance of light; and no extra coarse dualistic perception arises there at all. For example, though the sky is filled with moonlight, one sees without the sky being obscured by that; so in that state, the form of white light luminance arises without obscuring that clear, void-like pure space. When that luminance withdraws, luminance-radiance dawns, like the clear autumn sky filled with sunlight, even much more transparent pure voidness than the previous, arising with a red or orange color; and the rest are as above. Then, after that radiance has withdrawn, imminence begins, the stopping of wind-energies becomes great, and the object perception arises in the form of black[ness] like night-fog pervading void perception; the subjective consciousness declines and becomes unconscious; it is not a weakening of a faulty consciousness. Those signs completely arise at the time of death, but only partially similar states arise at sleep, as the nostril respiration does not cease. In the time of the path, the energy is injected into the heart center dhati channel and dissolves there, and the signs completely arise; when they dissolve elsewhere their mere suggestion does not arise."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"366 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp By influence of practice of those three and the intensity of the con­centration and dissolution of the wind-energies, many different degrees of extensiveness and solidity and duration of the object perception can occur. [J86aJ In the context of energy meditations and so on, if a black-out unconsciousness arises without being preceded by the first two lumi­nances, then it is not imminence. As for such kinds of three voids, granted they can arise between magic body attainment and objective clear light realization, on the occa­sion of arising in reverse order from objective clear light, and between attaining the learner's communion and attaining the non-learner's com­munion; and yet they are not mind isolation. Likewise, even before attaining mind isolation there is an occurrence of the wisdom of the three voids, so you should differentiate the three void wisdoms and the mind isolation void wisdoms by their degrees of pervasiveness. Some former Tibetans advocated all nonconceptual cognitions such as sense cognitions as whichever of the three luminances, claiming that luminance was such a cognition's first apprehension of an object, radi­ance was the progressive clarification of its seeing the details of the object, and imminence was the final approach to obscurity in its termina­tion. This interpretation is not explained in Root or Explanatory Ta ntras or in any of the treatises of the Noble father and sons; and it seems to contradict the Integrated Practices' above explanation of the definitions of the three luminances. Now, as for the previous mention of \"mind, mentality, and con­sciousness\" and the \"three realities\" and so forth as synonyms of the three luminances, it is because there is some reason for the attaching of each of their names to the three luminances; but it is not that all of them indicate the three luminances. If it were, there would be many inconsis­tencies, such as that the eighty instinctual natures would also become luminances.

As for the meaning of that, in place of the statement that \"after explaining the three [forms of ] mind, I must announce their attainment,\" the Integrated Practices translations of the Great Translator [Rinchen Zangpo] and [the translator] Chag read \"their basis,\" meaning \"let us express the wind-energies which support those three minds.\" Further, \"the three minds having mingled with the wind-energies,\" they mingle or are moved by the wind-energies, which means that such movement pro­duces cognitions apprehending objects through the sense doors and also the instinctual natures. Just after the above reference, [the Five Stages] continues: When you have luminance Mounted on wind-energies, Then all the instinctual natures Fully arise without remainder. Wherever the wind-energies remain, There the instinctual natures function. 111 An ambiguity emerges here with the use of Tib. mtshams (usually \"boundary\") to translate Skt. samdhya, \"twilight,\" aligning it with luminance-imminence, the third of the three luminance intuitions, the state at the boundary between the subtle mind and body and the extremely subtle bodymind, between the dualistsic universe and the nondual clear light. The simile used to convey the experience of imminence is that of the dark night sky, opposite to the moonlit and sunlit skies of luminance and radiance. Then. the pre­dawn morning twilight (Skt. pratyu[iha, Tib. tho rangs) is used as a simile for the clear light transparence, being a state of inconceivable nonduality of dark and light, mind and body, self and other, etc. So the \"twilight\" aligned with imminence is to be connected with evening twilight which is when light of day merges into dark of night.

Further, this is mentioned for the sake of repeatedly merging [the cogni­tions arising] from the voids of sleep with those that are gradually pro­duced from the arisal of the three voids in the reverse order at the time of taking birth. And this does not indicate that the occasional arisals of instinctual natures in conjunction with functioning cognitions are directly produced from the three voids. Though one can exhaustively divide cog­nitions into conceptual and nonconceptual, there is no need to exhaus­tively divide them into luminance and instinctual nature, and therefore it is not necessary for sense cognitions to be instinctual natures since they are not luminances.112 [Vl.B.3.b.ii.c'3'dTc\"4\"b\"-Instinctual natures] If such are the luminances, how do the eighty instinctual notions become instinctual natures?

Thus infinite space hints at luminance, infinite consciousness at radiance, absolute nothingness at imminence, and beyond consciousness and unconsciousness hints at clear light transparence. Of course, outsider and non-Tantric insider yogi/nrs who attain these immaterial states through advanced samadhis without deep knowledge of voidness. with­out unraveling the heart knot, and without awakening the great bliss mind, experience them as objective realms, and hence can get stuck in them without realizing the workings of their subliminal conceptualities.

If we use the same method on the thirty-three previous, however, we would have only twenty-one functions. Neither the Indian Noble writers nor Tsong Khapa are of much help with these enumerations, as apparently these counting questions were not thought of as interesting, in the context of the exalted paths of the perfection stage.

The Inte­grated Practices declares it to refer to the natural identity of the three luminances, saying \"in short, as for nature ... \" and \"in summary, it is these thirty-three natures, and the forty, and the seven.\" Lalq;hmi's state­ment that the meaning of \"nature\" is \"of the nature of that\" and the Clear Meaning's explanation that it is \"included in the category of that\" are incorrect. For, as the Self-Consecration of Aryadeva states: The earth element dissolves into water, The water dissolves into fire, Fire into the subtle element. Wind-energy dissolves into the mind, Mind dissolves into mental functions, Mental functions into ignorance, And that goes into clear light transparence. That wind-energy dissolves before the mind produces luminance, and, since that wind-energy is the mover of the instinctual natures, [190al the instincts must also dissolve at that time; hence, luminance and the instinctual natures are extremely incompatible.

I have already quoted the Integrated Practices statement that the instincts emerge from luminance. The Chag translation of the Five Stages, just as in the above explanation of the definition of the three luminances, holds them not to be non-different actualities. Just as in marking a mansion by [the fact that there is] a crow [on the roof], an actually different definer is given as the definition. Further, the statement of the Integrated Practices: Likewise, consciousness luminance is formless, yet can be inferred from the instinctual natures such as attach­ment, detachment, medium attachment, and so on is a means of defining luminance saying that luminance is inferred from the instinctual natures.

But such a person cannot induce certitude [about them] through direct perception. As for the hundred and sixty instinctual natures, they are set forth from the perspective of having a set of eighty engaged in each of day and night. Also, the Vajra Rosary explains that there are a hundred and eight instincts agitated by one hundred and eight wind-energies.115 Thus, in basic reality there are two states, one in which the instinct­moving wind-energy is dissolved and another in which it is not dissolved. The undissolved state is the time when the instincts emerge. In the dis­solved state, there are two states, one in which the three luminance wind­energies are dissolved and another in which they are not dissolved. The undissolved state is the time of the three voids. The dissolved state is the time of the arisal of clear light. In the time of the path also they are gen­erated in that manner; and that is the necessity to determine the arising [19lbl and dissolving processes of the four voids and the instinctual notions.

All such enumerations are heuristic devices used in meditative practice to develop introspective awareness of the workings of one's conscious and unconscious levels of mind. Just as in the case of the famous \"five aggregates\" -Jamyang Sheyba mentions in his Abhidharma Final Analysis textbook that there could be three aggregates or a hundred aggregates, and that the five are used as convenient for a specific context. 116 This whole section remains somewhat unclear, since Tsong Khapa starts off by saying that the luminances and the instinctual natures are not the same thing, since the instinctual (cont \"d)"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"376 · Brilliant lllumination of the Lamp [VJ.B.3.b.ii.c'3 'dTc\"4\"c\"-How to generate luminance wisdom] The third has two parts: [i\") Setting forth the separate systems; and [ii \"] Setting forth the correct opinions among them.

The luminances-mounted subtle wind-energies dissolve only at the transition from immi­nence into clear light transparence and universal voidness. Tsong Khapa's interest here is surely in the practice, and the mind isolation practitioner need not concern herself or himself with the eighty instincts-which disappear upon entering actual luminance-but rather with the fo ur voids and joys marking the dissolving process.

In terms of the first of these, you meditate that, by the light rays radiated from the three kinds of letters in the heart center, the crown HAM melts and fills the heart center, and when bliss develops the energy is taught to be held only for brief intervals; and otherwise there does not seem to be the instructions as before to hold the wind-energies in kiss connection and to visualize the compression process. lVI.8.3.b.ii.c'3'dTc\"4\"c\"ii\"-Setting fo rth the correct opinions among thcmj The second has two parts: [A'\"] Analyzing how are those systems; and [B'\") Setting forth the enduring opinion.

That occurs by the force of the previous, and it is not certain that there is any imprint of that later objective. Therefore, [though you may] have learned well the vajra recitation, once having learned [a bit about the mind objective], if you hold the visualizations as above explained and those experiences happen to develop, by that reason [alone] one cannot prove that that instruction is the [full] import of those treatises. As for the Five Stages' and Integrated Practices' explanations of the three letters and moon, sun, and vajra as synonyms of the three luminances, they mean that those names are designated to the three lumi­nances of the perfection stage, and that \"you should meditate imagining those, as in the creation stage [19.5aJ you cannot develop the three lumi­nance wisdoms.\" Therefore what the mentor Abhijfia asserted is correct, that it does not mean that [you can reach the mind objective just] by meditating through the perfection stage, having set up letters on moon and sun and so on. Even if you cause it to be produced, you must do it in the heart center; if you do it in the navel center, you do not understand the key point of this system. As for statement that \"they originate from the intuition of luminance and from radiance ... ,\" it indicates that the instinctual natures originate from those [luminance states], and does not teach that the intuitions originate from meditating on letters and so on. By making effort to meditate the letters and the white, red, and black colors of the light rays the objective perceptions arise in those colors; but that is not the way of the arisal of the colors explained in the treatises. Though the Concise Five Stages explains the three sets of letters in order, as illustrative of luminance, radiance, and imminence, it does not need to teach that the intuitions are produced by holding the mind in front of those letters set up [in visualization). As that text says: Bind the mind in equanimity, You will evenly see the wisdom Of the hub of the wheel in equipoise, And imminence is great void"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"382 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp -it does not agree with the explanation that you bind the mind from distracting to ot her objects while vis ualizing the letter set in the wheel, equilibriating the mind as if it dwelt in the lett er; from habituating to that equilibrium. lt95hl the mind enters into the indestructible along with its short A in the hub of the wheel. and the great void is produced from that turning into uniformity of experience. Therefore. even if you compress the wheel, once you have reached stabilized vivid vision in the letter, first visualize the outer, then com­press into the intermediate, then compress into the inner, and then com­press into the indestructible, and then become habituated to visualizing that. Or, setting up the letters as above, if you alternate doing that, the compression into the dhati is quick. Whereas if you do not compress into the interior of the dhati but habituate on the outside, the definitive paths of void will not arise, since they emerge from compressing and dissolv­ing into the dhati. From the Concise Five Stages, there is no explanation of holding the wind-energies in kiss connection beyond those of the meditation on the letters and the vajra recitation. Though the Vaj ra Rosary often states that \"you achieve by the reality of mantra alone!\"­if you meditate knowing the vital points of that, it has the meaning that you achieve even though you do not combine it with any other energy connection. Here, not having realized the complete vital points of vajra recita­tion, if you think that \"if there is no holding the wind-energies in kiss­connection, I won't be able to accomplish the dissolving of the wind­energies into the dhati\"; [you are right, as] it is so explained that if if you hold them in kiss-connection it seems you do not realize the key point of this practical instruction; but this does not mean in general that the vajra recitation meditator is at fault if s/he holds the wind-energies in kiss­connection. Here [in mind isolation context,] [196a] holding in kiss­connection requires that you perform the vase-pressure at the heart center. What is stated in the Vo w Arisal, \"in first meditating energy­connection, heart-center vase-pressure is a great hindrance,\" is a message for those who are inexpert in that yoga; if you know what you're doing it is not a big hindrance. By that explanation of the wind-energy compression process taught in the Wheel Endowed, you can understand also the compression process of the three wheel-less [instructions].

[Chandrak.Irti] states in the Illumination of the Lamp that the four signs from mirage to burning candle flame arise from the dissolution one into another of earth, water, fire, wind, and consciousness. It has been explained above how when wind dissolves luminance is produced, which does not mean that those many signs arise at the time of the three lumi­nances, and so it should be accepted according to [Aryadeva's] explana­tion in the Integrated Practices as expressed in the Concise Five Stages passage: First the mirage-like experience Arises with its five light-rays, Second there is the moon-like luminance, And third there is embrace by the light of sun; And from the night luminance there is imminence. [196bl Here not mentioning the three signs other than mirage is for the sake of brevity; it can be understood more extensively according to the Further Ta ntra and other contexts in the Illumination of the Lamp. In short, as the previous various systems did not add newly visualizations such as medi­tating letters here in the context of the mind isolation, it is not good to newly add visualizations as arts of developing mind isolation, without examining whether, having first achieved body isolation, you are or are not able to develop how much of the four voids in general by the speech isolation vajra recitation. This is because it would seem to be a case of explaining subtle arts while leaving out the principal of penetrating the vital points in the inner body where mind isolation is developed. The things explained above in the category of the arts of generating bliss through the visualizations given in the private instructions descending from Nagtso seem to be rendered in view of the need of the swift genera­tion of bliss; nevertheless, they do not seem to convey the import of the authoritative treatises."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"384 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [VI.

Further, the Vaj ra Rosary states often and explicitly how the mind isolation voids are generated from the perspective of the vajra reci­tation's blocking the circulation of the wind-energies: By strong application of vajra recitation Having known the nature of wind-energy, You cut off the instinct-driving wind-energies, And will attain the objective in the mind. I have already explained how in general the vajra recitation develops the voids.

Since, from the above quote from the third chapter of the Illumina­tion of the lAmp, \"you should meditate always day and night with the yoga of entry, abiding, emergence, and compression,\" the \"yoga of emer­gence, entry, and abiding\" is the vajra recitation, the \"compression yoga\" clearly must be taken to apply to being able to develop the four voids by means of vajra recitation and the indestructible. Naropa's [ 197bJ private inst ructions also sometimes mention the development of the voids as \"compression yoga.\" As for the way of compression, according to the Five Point statement \"it is the practice by means of the two contempla­tions,\" it should be practiced by means of the holistic holding and serial dissolving [samadhis]; since the Lawapa Commentary on Luyipa's Arts of Achievement explains the compression by serial dissolving from the lower part of the perfection stage, the Personal Instruction also explains through binding the compression by serial dissolving into the heart center indestructible, and there seems to be no difference about that here in this context. Also the private instructions from Naropa as inherited from Nag­tso explain the way to generate mind isolation without any letters, and mantra wheel letters do not appear in the three Concentrated Personal Instructions of the Marpa tradition; thus even in that tradition mantra wheel letters are not indispensable.

In regard to the \"great bliss\" mentioned where wisdom is the art of great bliss, [Aryadeva] says in the Integrated Practices that it is the magic body; therefore you need the external consort in order to fully generate the three intuitive wisdoms of mind isolation which are the base for achieving the magic body.

As for Lak�hmi' s explanation of this marking of the three wisdoms from the consort in the time of the third initiation, though in general such does apply in the time of the third initiation, this is the context of the path of learning [198bJ the mind isolation.

However, other treatises' clear explanation that when the enlightenment spirit melts and reaches this center in the body, this joy and void are produced, does not appear in the treatises of the five father and sons. Nevertheless, it is explained that when wind dissolves there is mind luminance, when mind dissolves there is mental function radiance, when mental function dissolves there is imminence, and when that dissolves clear light arises. As [Aryadeva explains] in the Integrated Practices: From the union of the vajra and the lotus, beginning from the crown, the enlightenment spirit melts from the 72,000 channels [199a] and descends gradually through the lustful, lustfree, and their medium states. By force of the melting of the enlightenment spirit the three wis­doms are produced. Thus the four voids arise by the force of both the process of dissolving the wind-energies and the melting and falling of the enlightenment spirit. In that regard, I have already explained that the best place for dissolving the energy of this system is the interior of the heart center dhati; and I will explain it further. Thus, through vajra recitation and so forth, the fury-fire blazes and the enlightenment spirit melts, and the place wherein compressing it produces the four voids is the heart center. Again, it is not that the four joys cannot be produced in the emergent order through the falling of the melted enlightenment spirit to the sensi­tive tip of the secret place and the reverse order of its reversing back up to the head crown.

Thus, by the inner condition of the method of meditating life-energy control however you do it, and by an outer condition of relying on union with the consort, the wind-energies and enlightenment spirits are both compressed into the heart center from the top and bottom of the body. As [Aryadeva says] in the Integrated Practices: Together with your consort, by the process of the holis­tic holding or serial dissolving, you enter into ultimate reality. Thereby, he explains that by uniting with the outer consort [199bl you enter into ultimate reality by the process of the four voids, using the compres­sion yoga of whichever of the two contemplations, which amounts to compression in the heart center; because, when you rely on previous habituation to the compression process in the heart center, when you unite with the consort and practice the yoga of the two contemplations, the union with the outer consort serves as a condition for the compres­sion of the wind-energy-mind into the heart center. As for the arisal of the voids from compression of the enlighten­ment spirits melted down [and up] from upper and lower body through the vajra recitation's ignition of the furor-f ire, it can be understood as applying from the boundary of being able to generate the voids from the dissolving process compressing the wind-energies into the heart center through vajra recitation, even though it is not yet perfected. Thus, you can understand correctly the generation of the voids by melting the en­lightenment spirits through the condition of the outer consort, serving as the condition of compressing [wind-energies and enlightenment spirits] into the heart center from the top and bottom of the body.

They have made the mistake of not deter­mining precisely the need to achieve the magic body according to the between [process] and the need to generate the voids systematically according to the processes of death.

If you apply them to the context of the outer consort, statements such as \"if enlightenment spirit falls after hav­ing held the showing of orgasmic wisdom, take it with the tongue,\" are for the propose of not allowing enlightenment spirit to be emitted, and are neither stated when one cannot inject the wind-energies into the dhati and dissolve them nor stated when one can dissolve the wind-energies in the dhati by the force of meditating vajra recitation and so on.

[202al In this regard, in other Tantras when the four joys are gener­ated, they usually do not teach uniting the first three joys with the voids, but often mention uniting [universal voidness] with the fourth, orgasmic joy. Here, as above explained, mind isolation is generated as a means of realizing the reality of the mind, and therefore it is a union of bliss and void in the context of all four voids. Since you will not realize selfless­ness if you do not unite the bliss and void of the three wisdom-intuitions, they will not arise in the mode of nonelaboration, and only the luminances themselves of white, red, and black will arise. If you do unite the bliss and void of those three, in the actuality of the certain knowledge of the view you must eliminate the subject-object dichotomy in the three lumi­nances. Thus, though the three luminances arise in that awareness, they do not arise in the experiential actuality of the conceptual differential of certainty. For example, when the noble equipoise arises in the mode of nonelaboration in conceptual consciousness, though it arises as having the form of the decline of dualistic perception in the experience of certainty, in general there is no decline of dualistic perception in that conceptual consciousness. Here you may wonder, \"Just after having recovered from the un­consciousness of imminence with its aspect of darkness, if there is at the least the arisal of the void like the clear pre-dawn sky, why in the context of mind isolation is the procedure for developing the three wisdoms taught and the universal void not taught?\" This is true.

Especially in the occasion of imminence unconsciousness, by just how great is the momen­tum of the loss of consciousness. just so much is the elimination of the mind's ability to distract itself to other objects and the development of immersion into clear light itself. As [Aryadeva says] in the Integrated Practices: By that very iron hook-like ignorance itself you do not cause there to be any mixture in consciousness, but openly reacting to clear light itself, there is the immacu­late actuality. At the time of the arisal of clear light, except for remembering the view of voidness and focusing one-pointedly on the import of reality, you must concentrate consciousness completely, unmoved by wind-energies, without any thinking about other objects. As [Aryadeva says] in the Inte­grated Practices, \"as long as consciousness is unmoved, even sleeping you behold the clearly luminous.\" He mentions here the sleep clear light just as an example. When your mental consciousness develops into the great bliss, by then remembering the import of selflessness, [203aJ you achieve the subject-object union of bliss and void, without requiring any other way of union.

The early [scholars] were greatly unreasonable in their claim that the ancient treatises taught that since one learned in the three isolations should receive the secret initiation, if one gets the vase initiation fully even without getting the higher initiations, it is alright to meditate the three isolations. [They are wrong] because, without getting the higher initiations to make one eligible for the perfection stage, one should not properly be taught the perfection stage secrets, and also because the treatise seems to mean that one learned in the three isolations should praise and petition in order to get the magic body instruction. Otherwise, to say that one learned in the three isolations would petition upon [only then] receiving the secret initiation along with the nine [vase] initiations has the fatal flaw of considering such a one eligible to meditate the three isolations without having received the rosary and so forth initiations.

Having already obtained initiations, when one requests this instruc­tion, having pleased the mentor and so on, [having performed] the three things [mentioned above], one should praise and petition [again], as that is required in common for both initiation and request for instruction. Having thus petitioned, the procedure through which the disciple petitions the mentor for the magic body instruction should be understood according to [Aryadeva's] explanation in the Lamp of Integrated Practices: Beginning from the creation stage IZOSuJ up until the completion of the body isolation, one just aspires to the nature of the three vajras and so forth.

The culmination of speech iso­lation also, by the process of entering and so forth, is acknowledged as just the vajra recitation, wherein there is no deity aspect either, as sounds are just like echoes. The culmination of mind isolation also amounts to just mere recognition of natural luminance, wherein one does not discover the actuality of the deity body supreme in all respects, since that mind is pure luminance. By this reasoning, relying on the superficial, one will not discover the abode. Therefore, one should seek to understand the creation of the deity from mere wisdom, [conveyed] from the presence of the mentor. As for this inquiry: from the time of the creation stage, within the experience of purging all ordinary concepts and percepts within clear light, while it seems to be explained that your mind must be generated within a deity's body, when the discerning investigate, it must be [only] from a certain boundary on the path that there is [the actual] creation from pure wisdom in a deity body, and not just in [your] wishful imagi­nation. There is a reason that from the start of the creation stage up to complete mind isolation it does not happen, or that by this 1205bJ process, one does not arrive at reliance on the superficial magic body and at abiding in that samadhi on those occasions. For that reason, [Aryadeva] said that for the actual creation-not mere imaginative deity body visu­alization-of the magic body from sheer wisdom, one must realize it from the live speech of the mentor. To prove the [three] reasonings [for why body, speech, and mind isolations are not the magic body] in order: from the beginning of the creation stage until one reaches the great secret single clan [body isola­tion], and the three body vajras etc. -\"etc.\" here including the merely imagined visualization creation of the five and hundred clan deity bodies -[there is no actual deity body]. Thus, in body isolation there is no magic body deity body, \"because the body is a mere mass of atomic particles.\" This means that, when the mind imagines one's deity body. the measure of its objectively becoming such [a body]-the form which is imagined and about which one generates one's deity-body pride-is no more than just that former body of aggregates and elements which are [now visual­ized as deities infused in] the masses of subtle atoms. This also shows"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"398 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp that mere visualization of that magic body deity body does not create the divinity, and that the yogi/ni needs a deity form other than the coarse body form as a basis for generating pride. Not only that, the magic body deity form is not a body even up to the culmination of the speech isola­tion, as the word \"also\" shows that there is no deity creation by the above \"mere imagination.\" Well then, what does the vajra recitation accomplish? By the process of entry, abiding, and exiting, [206al words are just caused to be known as echo-like, by settling the wind-energy, the vajra recitation base, to become extremely serviceable. The Integrated Prac­tices explains in the procedure section that the vajra recitation causes one to recognize the life-energy wind; and the Vajra Rosary also says that it makes the wind-energies known. The word \"just\" in that context excludes any deity body creation other than mere imaginary visualization. Even up to mind isolation culmination one does not discover the magic body deity body endowed with all supreme aspects of signs and marks; the word \"also,\" as above, including the previous reasons. Well then, what does [mind isolation] accomplish? One must understand \"natural luminance\" as the name of lumi­nance and the name of the natural instincts of the luminance [state], and so [mind isolation] amounts to knowing natural luminance as just the three voids; since on that occasion the yogilni comes to know his [or her] own mind as mere luminance devoid of instinctual constructs. Here a certain ancient Community practitioner, 119 explaining the lack of a deity body as a lack of the communion deity body, does not understand the meaning in context and does not see the import of the explanation of the last three reasons as proof of the lack of a deity body in body, speech, and mind [isolations, and of the fact] that the superficial, artificial, conceptual mind does not reach the communion body relying on meditating on the three isolations.

And here it is the latter that is intended. In the context of explaining the basis for achieving the magic body, it is declared that there is no person living in the life cycle other than the mere wind-energy-mind: which [shows Nagarjuna's] claim that, while the wind-energy-mind is not the [real] referent for the desig­nation of the term \"person,\"121 the designative base is identified as the being's subtle body. According to the Vaj ra Rosary: Than your life-energy vital essence, There is nothing other in the three realms; By the magical wind-energy, the three realms Are seen as like dreaming [in] a dream. Thus the vital essence of beings is their own life-energy, there being no other body of [beings of the] three realms than wind-energy; hence the magically illusory body of the three realms achieved by wind-energy is stated to be like a dream body. Here in the verbal expression mostly there is indication of the foundation for achieving the magic deity body; never­theless one can also apply it to the [magical] body itself; therefore [Chan­drakirti] in the Illumination of the Lamp quotes [this verse] as a source for the fact that the magic deity body is produced from the mere wind­energy-mind. Therefore, as the Vaj ra Rosary states: Birth, living, 1209bJ and dying, And abiding in the between existence, Whatever [states] the world constructs, Are the emanations of the energy of mind. Beings' births, lives, deaths, and between states are the emanations of mere wind-energy-mind. And as the Revelation of the Hidden In tention states: 121 This very subtle point shows how even in the esoteric area of the indestructible drop, the extremely subtle bodymind, etc., care is taken to avoid reifying this deepest level of personal continuity as any sort of intrinsically identiable \"person\" or \"thing.\""},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Chapter V//1-1\\vo Realiry Perfection Stage· 405 Conscious or unconscious, all those designated 'beings' are arisen from wind-energy; and again they are termi­nated by wind-energy.

Now this teaching that all beings have this body of wind-energy-mind. [indi­cates] the subtle body that serves as designative base of the term \"being.\" amounting to no more than the body of mere wind-energy-mind, indicat­ing that there is no other subtle body substantially different from that; which is not to indicate that there are no external objects or that the coarse evolutionary bodies are not beings' bodies. Thus, the bodies of beings are of two types; the temporary and the subtle. The first of these is the evolu­tionary, elemental, coarse and so forth body other than the body of mere wind-energy-mind; and the second is the body established from mere wind-energy-mind. Though the coarse body is not produced in the con­texts of first connecting into conception and so forth, it is not that it is not the body of a being. Likewise, 12IOaJ though at death the elemental body is eliminated, the being's body is not eliminated, hence [such an elemental body] is not the subtle body; [it rather stays only temporarily imposed upon the subtle body,] like salt in water. The wind-energy-mind body is never eliminated in all of those occasions, and so it is the subtle body; like wetness in water. Now even in this present occasion of the coarse matter body, the subtle body is a body of just wind-energy and mind, with the coarse body being like its residence. And although there might be other purposes for so stating that fact [in other contexts], the main reason [here] is in order to identify the subtle body that is the foundation from which the magic deity body is achieved.

As for that explanation of \"magical,\" the Vaj ra Angel [Further Ta ntra] states the same similes used in the Five Stages: One is taught to be the Lord, Who sees [things] to be like mirror images, Dreams, magical illusions, bubbles, And hallucinations; and this shows that here one must interpret according to the uncommon elucidations the import as explained even in other Unexcelled Tantras.

Therefore, as a method of easily making perceptible the unappre­hendable deity reality of those, 0 Divine Lord, Vajra Master, Teacher, please explain it! Here, if one understands the \"mere\" word, used in the statement above that the sign-endowed deity body was achieved from mere wisdom, as excluding any other cause not the mind, then it is incorrect for the mind alone to complete a deity body endowed with arms and legs and so on; since the So tra states that, [as concerns] the supporting body and the supported mind, if one is missing the one, the other does not exist. \"Having discriminating views\" refers to those thoughtful doubters, and \"reference and realization\" to [the fact that] those [persons] will not gain trusting certitude free of doubts without good reasons. \"Unapprehend­able\" refers to the signless reality [212a] of the deity, which must be realized as the magic body-as a method of doing so, please teach [us] to remove all doubts. As the answer to that, [Aryadeva] states that: 122 It occurs here that the experience of those who uphold the view of \"other-voidness\" -that ultimate reality voidness is not itself devoid of the buddha-qualities, that therefore the buddha matter bodies of beatitude and emanation come from the non-void absolute itself and so do not require a laboriously developed over aeions causal store of bodhi­sattva merit- are devotionally absolutizing an absolute activity for the role of the real, relative \"other\" of the Unexcelled Tantras, who is the father-mother mentor him or her self, whose \"word\" of consecration transmits the laboriously evolved compassionate bliss power of the timeless tradition that implants the relative buddha material qualities that enable the buddha embodiments."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage· 409 Those engaged in the way of the Sotras and those medi­tators abiding on the creation stage, though they may in­tensely imagine and use the similes of all things as being magical, dream-like, and reflection-like, they will not understand by these similes the self-consecration precept by which sheer intuitive wisdom completes the deity body of the nature of mentality.

This refutes that the magic body can be identified by those who understand penetratingly the import of superficiality and illusoriness as taught in the central way, who medi­tate on that, and who attain freedom from truth insistence. Although such is a general illusory samadhi, it does not have the import of the hidden meaning third stage magic body and the ultimate [meaning] fifth stage magic body. Creation stage meditators do visualize all things as illusory, yet they are still declared to not thereby understand the magic body self­consecration precept; [212bl which refutes the possibility that the magic body self-consecration can be identified by detached contemplation of the apparent deity body as abiding in the actuality of realitylessness.

Then the two luminances of wisdom and art, endowed with light rays, come to arise as the illusory deity body endowed with all variety and excellence. What is its mount? It is [subtle wind-]energy, which the mind vajra rides like a horse, traveling wher­ever it wishes. In the Commentary of this same text, the word \"truly\" occurs, and, so one questions if the illusory cause and condition is ultimately estab­lished.

But this answer is in terms of the two realities, which does not help at all to resolve the above doubts, and that \"wind-energy causes it to wander\" is an irrelevant answer, and so useless. Therefore, the mind being free of color and shape and equal to space means that it is not a body. Like ultimate reality it is hard to touch or understand. \"In truth\" means \"truly.\" One can understand these expressions easily as they resemble those given [from the Integrated Practices] in the context of the mind isolation. Granted that it is so that the mind is not embodied, [213bl the three lumi­nances of the mind isolation rely on wind-energy, and so wind-energy"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII- Two Reality Perfection Stage · 411 binds consciousness, or holds it. Most of the old translations are as above. But some of them say \"becoming common, they mingle ... \" and the Chag translation says the threefold luminance uses wind-energy as its element, and so its support is lightness.\" Some say that the meaning of the above is that since wind-energy and consciousness mingle, and wind-energy is lightness, so consciousness becomes lighter and lighter. But the meaning of \"light\" is that wind-energy is much subtler than the other elements and so has a common quality that makes it fit to mingle with consciousness. This fits with the Integrated Practices' section on mind isolation. From that merging of wind-energy and mind, wisdom luminance and art radi­ance, being endowed with fivefold light rays, arise as the magic deity body endowed with the excellence of signs such as arms and legs and so on. To summarize their meaning, although if the mind were alone without wind-energy, it could not be made into a deity body with faces and hands and so on, since the five-light-rayed wind-energy and mind exist as one actuality, there is no problem in producing the deity body. This indicates that if it was exclusively a consciousness that perceived the aspect of a deity, the aspect of form would exist, but it could not directly achieve the magic body. Though \"wisdom and art both\" are mentioned, just before all three luminances are mentioned, its theory on the foundation of the magic body is like that of the Five Stages. \"Cause and condition\" here refer to the material cause of the mind achieving the magic body-the previous mind- and the coordinating [21 4al condition­the wind-energy; while of that body [itself], the material cause is wind­energy and the coordinating condition is the previous mind. \"The mind vajra which is the three wisdoms mounts its mount like a horse and goes where it wants\" means that, at the time when the subtle body of mind isolation wind-energy-mind is made into the magic body, it separates apart from the coarse body and goes where it wishes either outside or inside. As for this meaning, the Integrated Practices states that \"the Con­sciousness Migrating Satra also states it very clearly.\" In that Sotra, it is stated that the arms and legs and so on of the between being, achieved just after death, are like the shadow of a man on the water, having no sensation of cold and heat, pleasure and pain, fatigue and rest and so forth, without flesh and so forth, as if unable to be destroyed by ele­ments. The Chag translation says, \"after having quoted such statements as 'this consciousness abandons the interior of the body of the previous migration and becomes the shape of another body'; and 'thus the between"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"412 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp existence of the childish alienated individual, etc.' becomes the cause of the life cycle\"; thus it explains [the between body functions] as in the above quotes. [Aryadeva] states that, though that Sutra does not describe the magic body clearly, it does describe clearly its intention of how a com­plete body with limbs and so on is made from just wind-energy-mind, how the magic body splits from the old body and so forth as made very clear in the similes that define it, how that wind-energy-mind becomes a cause of the between for one who does not have the art, and how the magic body arises for one f214bl skilled in that art. The Va irochana Enlightenment statement that \"the pure body like a rainbow will be attained by meditating reality\" is quoted in the Integrated Practices in the magic body context, which, though not teaching the way of achieving the magic body, is still suitable to quote as being useful to confirm generally that meditating the import of reality one achieves a rainbow-like body, and to confirm specifically that if one meditates the reality of mind isolation one achieves the rainbow-like magic body. [VI.B.3.h .ii.C '3 'd 'ii' A \"1 \"a \"ii \"B '\"2 \"'b '\" - Explaining very clearly the way it is achieved, along with its excellences] Thus, in order to achieve the magic body, it is necessary to be able to separate the coarse and subtle bodies by force of meditation. Further, regarding the art of separating those two through the yo gas of transferring consciousness heavenward and taking possession of the body [city] of another, as the Sheaf of Instructions explained the import of the Sampufa [Tantra], one must preliminarily practice the wind-energy yogas such as vase-breathing and one must visualize again and again consciousness mounted on wind-energy emerging from the heart center seat of con­sciousness. But here, one does not do such [practice]; one does it with another, distinctive, art. As for that, for example, when the death sequence occurs, from earth dissolving into water up to the death clear light, those stages naturally serve to separate the coarse and subtle bodies. Likewise, when the necessary preliminaries of the mind isolation, such as vajra reci­tation and so forth, the inner and outer life-energy control meditations, have been consummated, that very same complete [215aJ generation of mind isolation, from the perspective of generating earth dissolving into water and so on as in the process of death, itself separates the two bodies, and the self-consecration magic body is achieved from the mere wind-"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage · 413 energy-mind of the voids. The self here is the wind-energy-mind that serves as base of the designation thinking \"1.\" That very thing is created as the vajradhara body, which is the consecration. When one separates apart [into another body] the wind-energy­mind body through the power of body-possession, it is extremely different from creating [oneself] in the vajradhara body by imaginative attention. This is not just mere imaginative mind, but the wind-energy-mind itself is created as a deity body, which is dissimilar from the deity body of meditation where the mind is just envisioned in that form. Once one has attained the magic body of the learner's communion, as its homogeneous continuity is uninterrupted, one is said to \"live in reality,\" and the charac­teristics of the \"vajra body\" are complete. The third stage magic body proceeds purifying itself by realizing objective clear light; so though it is called \"vajra body,\" it is not full­fledged, [with characteristics complete]. Hence there is no contradiction in calling it \"a wisdom body\" which abides according to the yogi/ni's experience, intending that it does not abide as in the previous case. How­ever, except for using the expression \"third stage magic body\" without differentiating actual and virtuaP23 one should not hold that the actual self­consecration magic body is a deity body which is a mental state alone perceived as distinctly apart from the coarse body. Except for explaining that the magic body is achieved from the wind-energy-mind of the mind isolation three luminances, 1215bl it is not clear from the treatises of the five father and sons as to at which point in forward and reverse voids the magic body is achieved. Lak�hmi and so forth explain an art of a sudden process where one arises in the vajradhara body suddenly from clear light like a fish from water, and an art of a gradual process through immi­nence and so on where one arises in the vajradhara body from the point of entering luminance, having gone from clear light to imminence and from imminence to radiance. I will explain my own interpretation in the section [below] on communion. In regard to separating from the old body, it is understood from the above explanation that having abandoned the position of the old body it does not follow that it must abide [therein], and from the Illumination of 123 dngo!l dang rje!J mthun pai !lgyu lu!J."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"414 · Brilliant Illumination (�f the Lt1mp tht' Lamp explanation that the pure magic body dwells in the jewel sack of the body and so forth. If the magic body were achieved by the yogi/nT who has achieved mind isolation by a p rocedure of preserving both the subtle and coarse bodies. the father and son treatises' explanation that the magic body is achieved from just the wind-energy-mind would be incorrect; for example, if cloth were made from the whole ball of yam, the explanation that the cloth is made by specially picking out two separate threads from the ball of yarn would be inappropriate. Although at the first time of achieving it, it must be achieved from the wind-energy-mind of the voids, when one abides in it after achieving it, there are many occasions when the magic body exists even when the three wisdoms of luminance, radiance, and imnminence are not manifestly realized; hence it does not follow that the magic body is eliminated when those three are eliminated, or that those three [216al are present when the magic body is present. As for the way to achieve the magic body by what sort of will­projection, as it is not explicit in other treatises of the father and sons, one must know to apply the reasoning given by the Integrated Practices expla­nation that one should project the will that \"Uust as] on the occasion of attaining buddhahood in the between, one dwells in clear light, rejecting the ordinary body, I should resurrect [myself] by the process of self­consecration!\" This should be applied also in the case of those things con­forming to the magic body pattern. Such a body is said by the Wisdom Vaj ra Compendium to be illuminated by the twelve similes of magic. These twelve are magic, water-moon, hallucination, mirage, dream, echo, fairy city, illusion, rainbow, lightning, water-bubble, and mirror-reflection. They are called the \"twelve similes of magic\" even though \"magic\" is used only once as a simile, intending that the first simile stands for the rest, or that they are similes for the magic body. In that regard, as the vajradhara body is created just from wind­energy and mind, it is like a magic human, as it is just wind-energy-mind even though limbs and members are complete. As it pervades everywhere, it is like the moon in water. As it is devoid of flesh and bone and so on, it is an hallucination, like a body of human shadow. As it moves in an instant, it is like a mirage. As it is a body made of just wind-energy-mind, it is like a dream body separate from the evolutionary [coarse] body. [216b] Though included in one continuum with the evolutionary body, it appears as other, like an echo.

Though it is one, it appears as many, like an illusion. As the body's five colors appear unmixed and unobstructed, it is like a rainbow. As it abides within the aggregate of the evolutionary body, it is like lightning flashing within the thick of a thundercloud. As it arises sud­denly from the experience of voidness, it is li ke a bubble bursting forth in very clear water. As its limbs and members are perfect, it is like the image of Vajradhara arising in a mirror. Now these are how the learner's magic body is iluminated [by the similes]. When used to illuminate the master's magic body, the sixth and the tenth similes are used in a similar way. The Self-Consecration mentions \"shadow\" in the meaning of \"hallucination,\" and uses \"cloud\" in place of \"illusion.\" As for its various synonyms, it is according to the statements [in the Five Stages:] It is explained as \"self-consecration,\" With its nature taught as magical. This same thing is designated, Superficial reality, magicality, And the perfectly beatific body. That same becomes the fairy being, The vajra body is that same thing, Vajrasattva, the eminent personage. As for the excellence of attaining that magic body, it is said that one definitely will attain buddhahood in that same life. Again from the Five Stages: Gone into that [magic body] state, [one becomes] A lord, great spiritual hero, made of every bliss, And one gets home, clothes, [217al food, and so on Instantaneously, just from space. Static living is cut off, One is teacher, supreme person, Worshipped by all, including the gods, And is saluted again and again. The Integrated Practices also states that one will obtain the consecration of the Buddha.

In comment on which the Illumination of the Lamp says: \"Vajra gentle\" refers to the magic body with its mental nature ; and not only does one meditate that as one's body, speech, and mind, but also when one meditates having elaborated it into the body, speech, and mind of the three realms, it all becomes like vajra gentle. Vajras blazing to the magnificent extent of hundred leagues and through countless world realms indicate the illumination by your body's light, adorned by the ornaments such as the thirty-two signs. And if the discovery of such a wis­dom body is never even experienced by deities such as Brahma, what need to mention others; since it is the sphere of irreversibility. That great seal of Mafijushri 1217hl is not experienced or touched by [even the greatest] alienated individual beings; and so this samadhi is called \"unperceivable.\" And just after that it also says, \"that very magic nature body, because it is achieved by purification by means of clear light. ... \" Thus it explains this [impure magic body] entering into clear light by means of the two contemplations, and does not explain the communion magic body enter­ing clear light by means of the two contemplations; therefore this refers to the third stage magic body.

Since other treatises are not clearly explicit about the two proce­dures of creating the deities of the creation stage mantra body and the perfection stage wisdom body, all explanations of the procedure of deity creation in the perfection stage context are claimed by many who hold other systems to be [only] pertaining to the creation stage. As for those who do practice this system also, though they have differentiated the two [kinds of] deity bodies, it appears that their precise differentiation is extremely rare. Therefore, thinking that this very 12t8aJ greatly secret issue should not be lost, I have made it explicitly clear. lVI.8.3.b.ii.c'3'd'ii' A\"l \"a\"ii\"s\"'2'\"c\"'-Explaining what comes from the mentors' precepts] The third has two parts: [i' \"] How it is given in the personal instruction tradition; and [ii '\"] Explaining that import in connection with the treatise[s].

Further that magic body deity body is meditated within a reality source triangle white outside and red inside. Again, in the Wheel Endowed, [Serdingpa] explains that: It is meditated as the drop, which has been compressed into the indestructible drop in the center of the inner lotus, which arises as the father-mother deity body like a mirror reflection. In the Five Stages Single Session, there is an error which seems inconsis­tent with that tradition's two great and [several] lesser precepts, namely: One should aim the mind to the drop [2t8bl and meditate, that being the learner's clear light; and, when that is stable, one should engage in the paths of the conduct when one arises from the void drop as the deity body.124 Again the Five Point explains: That abiding with five light rays like the linear \"A\" is the reality condition, the wind-energy-mind body, and one meditates compressing the mind to that.

Therefore one can also understand the explana­tion in the two lesser private precepts of the short A and the HOM letter as the magic body. The Five Point explains: In the magic body practice, there are the magic equi­poise and the magic liberation. The first of these: in the southwest of your dwelling place make a skylight, sus­pend a sword above a copper kettle filled with lac-water; and place a mirror before you which reflects a painting of Vajrasattva; thus aim your mind and meditate. Since truth insistence [2t9aJ will not emerge toward these things, they identify magic illusion. This is said to be the instruction for purification in the creation stage. This is accepted as corresponding to the meaning of the Five Stages explanation: \"A well-shaped Vajrasattva,\" and so on. As for the way to terminate truth-insistence based on that, Serdingpa explains in the Per­sona/Instruction ofthe Tr ip le Continuum oJMagicallllusion:125 Of the three magic illusions, explain those of equipoise, dream, and between: as for the former, the first of the three solely purifying activities; holding magical illusion one should sit before a mirror image and, examining whether pleasure or displeasure, attachment or anger arise there from praise and blame, one should see to it that they do not. One should contemplate just like that.

When they do not arise, [the reflection] should merge into one and one should medi­tate oneself as like a magical deity body. One should prac­tice not being happy and attached when one is praised, anointed with sandalwood unguent from the right, and offered wealth and so on. And one should practice not being unhappy and angry when one is blamed, poked with an axe from the left, and one's wealth is robbed. Some people who uphold the personal instruction of this system, having set apart the designation \"magic illusion\" for equipoise, set up the way of meditating as holding the mind, having set the mind immobile by strict body-vital-point [penetration] and gaze; by holding it, energy is held; from that, experience develops. Earth, water, fire, wind, mind, mental events, misknowledge, and universal void- the former dissolves into the latter [219bl with the signs of mirage up to darkness. Then, from the cloudless sky-like universal voidness in reverse order up through the three luminances, the mind along with its energy-mount arises immeas­urably with the vivid vision of the experience of the magical deity body and so forth. Even though you meditate that way, if it does not develop that intensely, there is a method to develop the impact, extensively described in the Five Point. Or if that doesn't work, by meditating aiming one-pointedly at the heart center of the deity body reflected in the mirror, the first vividness of the image is luminance. Then, when the image seems to split apart, it is luminant radiance. Then its disappearance into darkness is luminant imminence. Then its total sky-like clear light transparence experience gives rise to a variety of experiences as above explained. Concerning this [outlook], as for the former [instruction], it seems as if these people are considering the \"self-consecration\" explained as the visions of various luminance experiences in the space of the retraction [yoga branch], cited previously from the Stainless Light and the Supreme Bliss Eulogy Commentary to be the same as this \"self-consecration\" of the occasion of magic body. As for the method of intensifying the impact, it seems to be based on some former Tibetans' explanation of the process of looking at any object, wherein the first vividness is luminance, its refinement is radiance, and its final unclear approach to termination is imminence."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Chapter Vlll-1\\.vo Reality Perfection Stage· 421 In the learning of the magical liberation, the Five Point explains its daytime waking practice and its night-time dreaming practice. As for the first 1220a1, within the experience of deity body vividness, one meditates integrating energy and mind by the experience of bliss-void in the throat center, thus generating the experience of engaging in the vital point of life-energy control; this develops the magical liberation. In sleep, dreams come, but here they do not, so these two are dissimilar. As for the tran­scendent liberation, one goes to Akanishta heaven and is blessed by the mentor, and one has visions of many emanation bodies and listens to the Dharma and so on. As for learning the mundane liberation, it is said that one sees heavens such as the Thirty-three, the [joyous] Tu�hita, and the [highest] Akani�hta, one goes to them, one is worshipped by gods and goddesses, one holds the drop from such as those, and it happens that one manifests various miracles. It is claimed that such things happen as if in a dream, caused by meditating the vase-breath-holding in the throat center preceded by focusing the will to engage in those liberations. The Equipoise Magic Illusion Instruction explains that one medi­tates the energy-kiss, aiming one's visualization at the heart center drop along with its short \"A,\" thus developing the experiences such as flying in the sky which generate the magical illusion liberation, thus cultivating direct experiential voidness without glee and pride and so on and without obstructions such as deep ravines and precipices and so on.

Thus, the intent of the instructions that explain the drop arising as deity body to be the creation of the magic body, and the drop and the syllable to be the magic body should be understood as meaning that the magic body is created from the subtle wind-energy-mind body indicated by those [drops and syllables]; so the magic body should not be interpreted as the mere deity body creation from the transformation of the drop and syllable appearing in the mind's eye. If one understands it like that [avoiding such misinterpretation], [one can rightly understand] the Concise Five Stages [passage], just after its explanation of doing the vajra recitation once the mantra wheel is established: Ordinary conception-instincts Are visualized as the mind of mantra itself. Purifying the body purifies conceptions, Purifying wind-energy, one becomes taintless, And manifests the wisdom superficial magic [body]. This teaches 1221al the procedure of creating the magic body by purifying the energy by means of vajra recitation preceded by visualizing the mantra wheel. Concerning that, the forms of the mantra-letters set on the petals of the wheel are the means of indicating the mind of the eighty ordinary conceptions and the wind-energies that move them. The bodies or forms of those indicative syllables are serially collected and purified, which purifies the conceptions and their attendant wind-energies. When the conception-mobilizing wind-energies are purified, that means the reali­zation of the intuitive wisdom body, the superficial reality magic body.

Further, as for the twelve similes of magic illusion characterizing the magic body, I will explain a few of the correspondences between simile and referent, as it is said that ;'by recognizing them one recognizes the magic body.\" I approve the explanation that the ascertainment of the correspondence between simile and referent here is the means of deter­mining the magic body, and also, the personal instructions' explanation that such [ascertainment] is also the means of empowering the clarity of creation stage practice when it is unclear. In the magic body section of the Five Stages, if one so interprets the meaning of the passage beginning with \"A well-formed Vajrasattva appears,\"126 and if one meditates while perceiving a mirror image, then one sets the mind for a while having moved mentally out [of the mirror]; and [22t bl finally one takes the creation stage deity body merged into oneself as the magic body. This then contradicts the [author's own previous] statement that \"from one's experience of bliss-void by intuitive wisdom of voidness one generates the magic body without interference by any other,\" and it disagrees with all authoritative treatises, and also appears to contradict [the author's] own root verse. The mentor Marpa had many different private instruc­tions from many mentors, among his instructions on each Tantra, so it is not sure that all of his instructions come from Naropa. Well then, one asks, what is the meaning of the Five Stages' statement: Free from existence and non-existence, A well-formed Vajrasattva appears, As if reflected clearly In a flawless mirror. Endowed with all the best forms, This body that always fascinates Should be shown to the good disciple; That is called \"self-consecration.\" l26 The full verse is cited just below."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"424 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp This means that it is a body like the accurately drawn image of Vajradhara, free of two extremes, dawning in clear vision in the pure sur­face of a mirror, which is superior in all aspects and always delightful to the beholder. And the meaning shown to the disciple by connecting the simile and the meaning of the reflected image and the magic body is explained as \"self-consecration.\" It is not that one meditates while visu­alizing oneself as reflected in a mirror or that the magic body is shown to be the deity body extracted from the mirror and drawn into oneself. Otherwise, one would have to literally follow [as meditation instructions] the other similes. As for the \"reflection\" simile, [222al among the three out of twelve similes mentioned in the Five Stages, it is the reflection of a vajradhara image and not reflections in general. And it is a simile for the body' s parts all being completed simultaneously. The rainbow simile indicates unobstructedness and the non-mixture of colors. The water-moon simile indicates the singularity of the magic body itself, being nevertheless capable of creating multiple emanations to accord with the disciples. And as for the Self-Consecration's statement- \" By them one meditates the body!\"-that one meditates on the magic body through those three similes, it means that one should meditate on the magic body as ascer­tained according to the description by those [similes]. According to the two ways of achieving the magic body by medi­tating visualizing a mirror reflection, it does not mean that one must complete the creation stage and the three isolations to achieve it. As for advocating the magic body depending on the explanations in the Stain­less Light and so on that the luminance of the experience of retraction is self-consecration, it would force you to claim that the eight [signs] from mirage up to the Rahu-like black luminant [imminence] are the magic body, and that the explanation of the deity body only arising during the reverse order [of the signs] after that as the magic body is incorrect. The Ti me Ma chine mentions the [eight death] signs such as mirage in the con­text of retraction as the signs of the time of approaching [initial] reversal and [final] inward reversal of the sense faculty wind-energies engage­ment with ordinary objects. The four signs such as mirage which arise in the context of mind isolation and so on are the signs which arise immedi­ately after those [reverse order] four voids, since it has already been often stated 1222bl that the wind-energies must have entered and dissolved into the dhati channel for them [to have arisen]. Therefore, the visions of"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage · 425 the aspects of moon, sun, and Rahu in the context of retraction do not amount to the same thing as the moonlight and so on of the three voids. In short, if you know well the samadhi wherein the sense conscious­nesses proceed to dissolve well before the natural instincts, and their motor wind-energies dissolve at the time of generating the mind isolation voids after completing the vajra recitation, then you will not feel any doubt such as \"will there be any meditating while seeing with the eyes when the magic body is achieved?\" In general, as for the aftermath arisal of whatever appears as false magical illusion, if you develop great bliss on the occasion of the three isolations and the magic body, it should be a source of intensifying your meditation itself by combining it with penetratingly understood voidness. There is little importance [of using such bliss] in the aftermath context [to direct] the notions and so on of liking or not liking or being or not being reflections to terminate the truth insistence habit. Here, if you develop certainty through the rationally aware wisdom that has com­pletely eliminated the truth-habit-objectification pattern concerning inner and outer things, subsequently the process of objective appearances arising as magical illusions by their own momentum depends on the excellent understanding of the centrist reasonings. And the Five Stages' pronouncement [to the effect] that, after attaining the magic body, one sees everything as illusion no matter in what activities refers both to the vision of illusion that is common with the Transcendence [Vehicle] and to the previously explained vision of the extraordinary magical illusion [body] wherein the subtle bodies of all beings are seen as no more than mere wind-energy-mind and so on.

In Savior Nagarjuna's treatises, the mergers are not literally clear, except for the explanation in the Five Stages of the magic body as the between and the suitability of explaining the merger of those two. Naga­bodhi doesn't mention utilizing the between, sleep, and dream, except for mentioning the use of the death process in the perfection stage, and the use of birth, death, and between in the creation stage. Chandrakirti explains the death and between mergers in attaining buddhahood in the between, and, except for the context of explaining the dreamlikeness of all things in the fifteenth chapter, where he quotes a reference from the Integrated Practices to establish the equality in truthlessness of the things of dream and waking, he does not openly explain the sleep and dream mergers. Thus, this does not mean that one can claim that this system gives the instructions of holding the dream and so on in the fifteenth chapter expla­nation of the dreamlikeness. Therefore, the explanation of merging sleep and the four voids is not in any other treatise of the father and sons [224aJ except for the Integrated Practices. The Integrated Practices states: Having familiarized from birth to birth and having learned the teaching of selflessness, understanding the yoga of merging, one should merge together with the natural luminance; and through this process one should perceive it in the ultimate reality. The process is as fo llows: Plunge the aggregates and so on into the subtle element. Plunge the subtle element into the mind. Plunge the mind into mental functioning. Plunge mental fu nc­tioning into misknowledge. Thus uniting things, fall into sleep. At this time, awareness is forgotten in the instant of mind, mental function, and misknowledge. Afterward, the reality of intuitive wisdom free from unconsciousness also is clear light transparence. There being liberation, through wind-energy, natural instincts are discovered, whereby other things emerge in one's dream. As long as consciousness does not move, one sleeps and beholds clear light; that is called \"the interior manifest enlighten­ment, introspectively realized ultimate reality free of"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"428 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp body, speech, and mind.\" Through this process, the tran­scendent buddha hosts abiding in the mandala of the body are to be killed and merged into suchness, and one attains the accomplishment of the well-destined; and without relying on either the elaborated or unelaborated activities one totally exchanges one's form. This is what it means. [224bJ Chag' s translation here is better, saying \"energy moves the natural instincts, if other dreams do not arise .... \" Just after the above quote, [the Integrated Practices] states: This very meaning, from the Great Yoga Tantra called Revelation of the Hidden Intention, is expressed: Seeing inner things such as form Is pronounced to be \"critical insight,\" While counting Ak�hobhya and so on, Abide in quiescence of all notions. These are explained as peace, The suchness of insubstantiality; And the yogi/ni merges the buddhas In the mandala of suchness. Thus the yogi/ni who generates sleep into the experience of the samadhi of the four voids is one who lives with the extremely unelaborated con­duct. Such an embodiment has two procedures of developing the four voids, at the times of falling asleep and waking from sleep; here the first is not described. When that [procedure] develops the four voids, it is said to develop them thus. Again, the Integrated Practices states, \"By this process one engages in just the acts of bhu su ku,\" meaning that one simply lives by eating and drinking, urinating and defecating, and other­wise merely meditating clear light by constant sleeping. If one understands the point of this explanation to be that there is no meditation of clear light other than by falling asleep, one will come to understand the ulti­mate points of the other mergers. Well then, while the Revelation of the Hidden Intention teaches that the yogi/ni should plunge the buddha-aggregates and so on into the clear light mandala of suchness, [225aJ how can that be interpreted as"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage · 429 substantiating the plunging of the aggregates and so on into clear light by the process of the four voids of sleep? Though the yogi/or's producing the experience of the four voids of sleep is not explicitly stated in the Tantra's words, it can be understood by Aryadeva's elucidation that uses the personal instruction by Nagar­juna. Thus, concerning such a process of plunging into clear light, the meaning of the Revelation of the Hidden Intention statement about the aggregates and so on being plunged into clear light completely serves as a means of understanding [that process]. For example, the expression that states that the definition of a pot is \"round-bellied\" does not explicitly show, mixing up round-belliedness and that specific object, that a jade's round-belliedness is [also a kind of] pot; nevertheless it does show com­pletely the round-belliedness of that specific object. As for the statement that \"the well-destined accomplishment will be achieved when one kills the hosts of transcendent buddhas,\" it is the same as the Root Ta ntra statement that Killing the hosts of transcendent buddhas, One will attain the very supreme accomplishment! And that quote, by its similarity of character, is also properly applied to the clear light of sleep. Relying on that personal instruction of Aryadeva, that mention of which scriptural text the [practice of the] clear light of sleep relies on, can make other [points] understandable. As for such hold­ing of the clear light of sleep, it seems to be part of the activities of attaining buddhahood in that life . Thus the supreme of merging sleep and clear light intends the buddhahood in this life of the most developed person. Attaining buddhahood in the between or after rebirth in another life require that [instruction only] according to the personal instructions of the mentors (22SbJ. Thus, if such explanations in personal instructions and the process of generating the four voids of sleep depending on them do not have effect, when one sees that the Integrated Practices states that the extremely unelaborated practitioner should use them, one can under­stand that they are teachings accessible [only] for such a person. So such a person nowadays should not neglect such teachings, or the great import will be lost. The Integrated Practices' stated process of merging sleep and the four voids, though it is beyond the ability of the inferior person. it is not that they cannot develop the merely general samadhi merging sleep and the fo ur voids. So one must accurately distinguish the diffe rences of"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"430 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp the paths. Therefore, that source in the Integrated Practices can be applied by contemporary persons to the holding of the voids of sleep. Well, what is the source for the instructions of dreams? That also, since it is not explicated in the Tantra and in the other texts of the father and sons, must be understood from the Integrated Practices , as follows: Why? Sleeping a long time. Why? One abandons the body's interior, and in the dream one goes to the Thirty­three Heaven or to other countries and regions, experi­encing the five sense-experiences. Again, coming here into the body, one will attain the fruition of experiencing virtuous and unvirtuous dreams. One should thus inquire into dreams, \"Are nonsleeping states the same or different from sleep-states?\" As for \"Why? Sleeping a long time,\" it inquires into the cause of long sleep without dreams arising. l226al As for \"Why? Abandoning the interior of the body,\" it means as above, at the time of dreams arising after falling asleep, a dream body separates from the interior of the previous body, and going to other countries and places it comes again to this body. \"Why does it come back?\"- again inquires into the cause of its entering there. According to the wording in the Chag translation, \"in the dream, with all senses, to the abode of the Thirty-three, or ... \" it means that the separate dream body seems to have a complete life-support for all senses. As for the meaning of \"Why? Dreams virtuous and ... ,\" it inquires into the cause of experience, at the time of awakening, of the fruits of the good or bad signs of the dream. As for \"Is sleep different or not from the waking?\" it inquires into whether there is the difference that the objects seen in dreams are false and those seen on waking are real. In answer to that, it is said to be excellent to inquire into the nature of dreams, in order to eliminate doubts about perceptions viewed as substantial in the body that has the nature of beginninglessness, and in order to illuminate the explanations of the self-consecration. And so [The Integrated Practices] states: Therefore, from the perspective of dream[likeness], you should introspectively realize all deity bodies explained as mirror-reflections, you should thoroughly understand"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-1\\m Reality Perfection Stage · 43 1 fo llowing the Ta ntras and Sotras. and you should attend with a single-pointed mind.

Here, [the task is] to dispel the \"doubts about perceptions held as substantial in the body,\" namely the doubts about whether one can or cannot achieve the magic body like a rainbow, not understanding the coarse and subtle bodies separately, but holding the mere coarse body as substantial and depending on it as life support. The Chag translation has \"like a mirror-reflection.\" As for how the Tantras cause realization by means of the dream simile, it is expressed from \"aggregates\" up to the \"mind awakened.\" And as for how the Siitras cause realization, it is explained quoting the Purification of Evolutionary Obstructions Sarra regarding differentiating true and false in regard to the waking and dream states. !227aJ As for gaining realization through the Tantras, the magic body is taught relying on the Root Tantra and the Wisdom Vajra Compendium. As for the meaning of the first line, according to the Vajra Rosary statement, [beyond] the first four aggregates, the four elements such as earth, the four objective media, the four faculties such as eye, the words"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"432 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp \"and so forth\" include all the rest. As for them being included here in the body, one gradually collects consciousness [normally] involuntarily engaged with objects. Thus collected, the two consciousnesses arise, those of luminance and radiance. Of those two, the former collects into the latter and dissolves into imminence, and one becomes a great void and falls into deep sleep. As for \"dense earth,\" from the Community Explanatory Tantra the Four Goddess Dial ogue, when it establishes the four mandalas in the body, the heart center is called \"earth.\" Other Tantras also assign earth to the heart center. Collecting the wind-energies in the heart center it becomes dense, and on strength of that, dreams do not arise and one sleeps long. These express in general the cause of going to sleep and in specific the cause of long remaining sleeping. When the imminence unconsciousness after dream experience begins to clear, a sleep clear light will dawn; and when that is released dreams arise, so that clear light is included in imminence. In the old translations, \"beings [going]\" here refers to sleep, and the Chag translation has \"persons expe­rience dreams day and night.\" As for \"wind-energies,\" it should be understood by the key of inquiring into the dream body made of mere wind-energy-mind going to other places. [227bJ As for effects developing and not developing, it has to do with the power of evolution being exhausted or not exhausted when that wind-energy-mind is separate and not separate from this coarse body. Thus, when it is not exhausted, it says \"again one engages here,\" expressing the cause of repeated engagement. As for the answers to the third question, one can understand that the separated dream body still has one continuum with that shown func­tioning in the previous body. And the second \"awakening from the dream\" and the third \"desiring fruition\" show the non-differentiation of the truth and falsity of dream and awakeness. The Chag translation says \"all those things are dream-like.\" By the five lines \"just as\" and so on it shows that the beatific body has no flesh and bone and so on, yet it dwells in a body of coarse elements in order to be seen by beings, and the emanation body performs deeds for the sake of beings, and this enables one to understand how the dream body goes to other places when one sleeps, and how the waking mind functions again in the old body. Thus since the dream body is like the beatific body, one understands [it as like] the magic body, and that body entering in the coarse body is understood as like [the beatific body entering] the emanation body, and this shows how to understand the magic body beatific body upholding the coarse"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage· 433 body emanation body. The Chag translation says, \"the mind waking from sleep by that process.\" Therefore, since the three voids that precede the magic body are exemplified by the three voids of sleep that precede the dream [body], [228al the actual magic body is exemplified by the dream body, and the [waking in the coarse body] after the dream exemplifies the magic body incorporating the emanation body. You should understand from the per­sonal instruction of Aryadeva that the dream example, out of the twelve examples, is peerless in exemplifying the magic body. Except for the fact that by connecting the corresponding elements of example and referent in the other similes you get a mere idea of developing certainty about the magic body, you cannot develop the metaphoric magic body as an actual path through the exemplification from those examples; but such power does reside in the dream example, and so it is superior. Further, as for the teaching that the yogi/ni develops the four voids of sleep that occur prior to the dream into the actuality of samadhi, it is the instruction in the merging of sleep and clear light, so you can under­stand by irresistible reasoning the instruction that the body of the dream that occurs after those is merged with the magic body. You can know it with certainty through the key point that there are explanations for [both] creation stage practitioners and perfection stage practitioners (of three each)127 of the path three bodies and the basis three bodies to be purified. Thus, this is how this supreme system becomes the instruction about the dream, and that process is necessary for all three [types of] persons. The Apparitional Nondual Triumph [Tantra] states: The place of ejection with the wind-energy Develops in the throat of all beings, Abiding there with the letter OM, That which is called \"unexcelled.\" By holding, changing, growing, Remembering magic, and sealing, Both become the path of samadhi. Though it thus explains how to hold 122!1hf the dream, it is hard to believe. 127 My text hal> lam gyi .�ku g.�um g.�um, bull think the second gsum is an error."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"434 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp As for the mergers of death and between, the Integrated Practices and so on explain buddhahood in the between, which is also fit to be interpreted as buddhahood after a rebirth depending on that, as in the case of the sleep merger. As for the system of relying on the sources for the continuum and so on of sleep and dream, it can be inferred from the foregoing. Thus, if you understand well how to explain these merger instructions, which are Marpa's distinctive speciality, as leading back to the treatises of the personal instructions of the Noble father and sons, it seems to be the unexcelled distinctive speciality [of the tradition]. Thus, in the context of the magic body of the metaphoric illusion, exemplifying depending on the dream example, in terms of the statements of the Inte­grated Practices, the dream instructions are connected with the magic body context; and so the instructions of holding the sleep voids are also connected to that context. In terms of their import, from the boundary of being able to develop at least the four voids during waking time, you can enter into the void of sleep. After that, when you meditate the instructions of dream, this [practice] can occur either in the context of body isolation, or in those of speech or mind isolation. As for merging with actual death and between, that happens on those occasions; and developing in correspondence with those two is des­ignated \"mergers with those two,\" but actually the practice is done as appropriate in waking time or in sleep time.

However, the Five Point explanation is better, that the four voids are held fi rst at the time of sleep, and then after that the dream body resurrects as the beatific body. The essence of the instruction of dreams is that the dream body rises up as the beatific body: because for that to happen, the voids must first be produced; because the sequence must correspond to the the basis time sleep and dream process; because, as the the voids of the mind isolation must precede the third stage magic body, the clear light voids must precede the communion magic body; and because the sequence is always the same, the between arising from the death void, and the [creation stage] primal savior being created from the dissolving of one's visualization into clear light and so on. Here, although the \"sleep clear light\" has the name of \"clear light,\" I have already ex­plained that it is not [the real clear light, which is not experienced] short of the metaphoric clear light after the occasion of magic body. Here you might wonder, \"If, before meditating on the magic [body] of the dream, the sleep clear light [229bJ is held, how is it held?\" In this regard, in general there are two ways to create sleep as an experience of samadhi. Thus, first, if one finds a stable samadhi of the qui­escence common to the philosophical Individual and Universal Vehicles and to the Mantric and Transcendence Vehicles, even if one does not make a purposeful effort to create sleep as a samadhi, when one experiences waking state samadhi at the point of falling asleep, and then falls asleep right after that, one might pass into many samadhis without experiencing an ordinary sleep. Again, second, at the time of falling asleep after the arisal of the four signs such as mirage by the power of forcing the wind­energies into the dhati channel, the three voids such as luminance like moonlight first arise, and then one generates sleep into clear light like a cloudless open sky. In the first of these [two ways], without any prior arisal of the four signs such as mirage or the three voids such as moonlight-like luminance, though there is an arisal of a transparent clarity of pure void­ness, still it does not mean it is the sleep clear light. In order to produce such a [samadhic sleep,] it is not necessary to have the arts of holding the"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"436 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp sleep clear light taught in the Mantra Vehicle and one does not need to enter into this vehicle. Therefore, to generate sleep into clear light here, it must be developed in the latter manner by the force of dissolving the wind-energies into the dhati channel. Therefore, having meditated during waking time on the instructions of penetrating the vital points in the body, from the boundary of at least being able to develop the four voids, those voids can be merged with the four voids of sleep; since otherwise, though one wants to merge [230aJ [the clear light] with sleep, there is nothing there to merge with it. In that regard, as in the occasion of sleep, usually the subtle breath­ing in and out in the nostrils is not eliminated. Though there is no basis time void of sleep according to the void of dissolving in the dhati channel, cutting off even the subtle respiration, it is not that there are no four voids [at all]. Even so, there are great differences between the sleep before any dreams have arisen and [the sleep] after they have arisen in [terms of] the intensity of dissolving the wind-energies into the heart center and in the dissolving and not dissolving of the coarse [wind­energies]. The yogi/ni who is capable of merging the waking time voids and the sleeping time voids, at the time of developing the sleep void, must approach eliminating even the subtle nostril respiration and disolv­ing it into the central dhati channel. For such a person, when they begin to go to sleep, at first though the four signs such as mirage might not arise in definite sequence, as they cultivate further they must definitely arise in neat arrangement. Therefore, a sleep which is not preceded by the arisal in definite sequence of the three voids, when it is produced as an actual samadhi, is still not the sleep clear light; because such an arisal of universal void clear light must definitely be preceded by void, extreme void, and great void, since each is the cause of the succeeding one that is its effect. Therefore, in the Marpa system's personal instruction of the force­ful method of [attaining] clear light transparence, though there is an expla­nation of holding the sleep void in a month's retreat by visualizing the setting of the white and red drops in the center of the four petals of the heart center lotus, if you concentrate on that visualization during one month and meditate continuously night and day l:ZJObl, it could happen that the wind-energies might concentrate somewhat easily. And that is the life-energy control of meditating the indestructible in the heart center. Further, as a preliminary to that, when you can develop the four voids"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage· 437 during waking time, you can then merge them with sleep: it is not that you will develop this ability by meditating this only at going to sleep, not meditating anything else day and night. Further, on the point of falling asleep, if you meditate again and again by aiming your visualization, it can happen that you can identify the basis time sleep void, but the fully defined voids from dissolving wind-energies cannot arise. As the Five Point states [in words to the effect that]: Before merging with the dream, in order to hold the sleep void, you must set the [unexcelled] anuttara in the throat. Meytson asserts meditation on the throat center, and Tsurton asserts meditation on the heart center; these meaning that for meditating clear light focus on the heart center and for meditating the dream magic body focus on the throat center. Visualizing the petals' four letters, connect each of them with holding each of the voids. Thus, prior to merging with the dream, it is better if you hold the voids of sleep. If you hold them alternatively, the lotus with the drop should be held in the heart center according to Tsurton's position, and the throat center meditation is not good. If you meditate clear light, due to its connectedness with the heart center, you must meditate in the heart center. Without being able to enter the merging with the dream by the power of dissolving the wind-energies, if you hold the dream by the power of will, it seems you must have a great distinction of connecting with meditating in the throat center. According to the explanation that the \"meditation of anuttara\" is the Nondual Triumph Ta ntra, this can be thought of as [23Ial the position of some Indians. But to accomplish the meditation of the mantra wheel at the heart center according to the instructions of Naropa, not to practice by this [way], it does not seem there is cause to practice by those four letters [alone]. Therefore, when you hold the sleep clear light, it is better to meditate on visualizing the white and red drop in the heart center according to Marpa' s personal instructions. That seems to be the orientation of the mind toward the indestructible in the center of the mantra wheel in the heart center. So if you want to expand from that. you can set the mantra wheel and contract it as previously explained. As the Five Stages Single Session explains, you should visualize the four letters along with the central drop in the heart center and practice the vajra"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"4.'M · Brillitmt Illumination t�f the Lamp nx-itation to hold the sleep clear light. Here the need or lack of need to set up the fnur letters has already been explained; and the holding of the sleep clear light by practicing vajra recitation having visualized the drop in the heart center is the marvellous instruction; since it is also the import of the Re\\·elation of the Hidden Intention. As the Revelation of the Hidden Intention states. just after the passage explaining the recitation of the wind-energies of the four mandalas: One explains it al l in the eighteen; Again, that abides in these themselves. Just as milk pervades And comes to be new butter, So Pandaravasini, and so on, Abide there in peace itself. -and after that, from \"The inner things such as form ... \" up to \"the Buddha enters\" -and after that: In and out breathing of the yogi/ni, The reality of uniting is sameness. Wisdom abiding in art, Recite without losing the limbs [23JbJ of mantra. Knowing the yoga in the actuality Of all activities, lying down and so on, [As the] nameless, the inexpressible, Transcending three times, always recite. The first six lines here state that in the vajra recitation of Pandara and so on, the clear light of the actuality of the eighteen voidnesses abides like fresh butter emerges from the milk; thereby explaining the develop­ment of the four voids through vajra recitation. From \"matter and so on ... \" up to \"enter the buddha ... \" the aggregates are explained as enter­ing into clear light, the meaning of which also applies to the sleep clear light, as I have already explained. \"The yoga\" and so on the four lines decribes the recitation uniting energy and mantra indivisibly. The next four lines teach one to perform the recitation also at the time of lying down. Thus, it teaches that at the time of lying down at night, doing the vajra recitation develops the four voids, since that also means that vajra recitation can develop the sleep clear light. In short, whichever art devel­ops the four voids during waking time must be merged to develop the"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII- Tw o Reality Perfection Stage · 439 four voids at the time of going to sleep. The supreme art during waking time is the meditation of the indestructible at the heart and the vajra reci­tation, as I have already extensively explained. Those two arts of holding the clear light of sleep come from the per­sonal instructions of Master Marpa and must be understood as the instruc­tions of the Root and Explanatory Ta ntras and the unexcelled intention of the fa ther and sons. It is of crucial importance to distinguish the mutually intermingled, scattered personal instructions. 1232nl lf you understand this, when the Integrated Practices states that sleep emerges as the actuality of the four voids. you can fully eliminate the arisal of the doubt that wonders \" where was this art of holding the clear light of sleep stated?\" In general, in regard to whichever path, if you know how to tum with methodical skill whatever exists in the basis reality into the path. it is swift[er]. Thus in this time of sleep also, the base reality is that the wind-energies naturally withdraw and a void is produced. So if you know how to turn it into a path through the instructions of merging, it is extremely swift. Though there are voids in the base reality, since there is no void of very great intensity and sleep has a great tendency to destroy mindfulness, you will not be able to develop a certitude of recognition [of the four voids] until you can tum the process into a path. Here, if there is no diminishing at all of the force of mindfulness, sleep will not come; and if the loss of mindfulness is too severe you just fall asleep and never ascertain the four voids of sleep. Thus you must practice through the personal instruction, when going to sleep, doing it without losing mind­fulness and so losing ability to ascertain the void. The obstruction of this virtuous practice through not falling asleep is rather weak in intensity; and among the personal instructions there are many ways to dispel that [insomnia] and too deep a sleep, as well as other methods not explained there. After the arisal of the voids of light, moder­ate, and deep sleep, at the time of clear light, having remembered the [realistic] worldview, you must cultivate it for a long time. Thus, quick waking and quick dream arisal become obstacles; so I will give a definite explanation of the basic way of dispelling those. The yogi/ni who inserts and dissolves the wind-energies in the dhuti [232bl can produce the four joys and the four voids; but if s/he does not know such an instruction of merging, when s/he meditates by merging sleep with those experiences s/he will not develop intense understanding of the path in this life and will not attain the supreme [accomplishment]. And at the time of death,"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"440 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp not only will s/he not be able to be immune from the suffering of death by having taken the four voids of death as the path but s/he will not know how to intensify the understanding of the path. Therefore, you should become expert in the instructions of merging. If you know them well, though you won't develop the power [to accomplish these things] just by that, by applying them to your mind again and again you will develop a marvelous strong instinct. Thus, this thorough explanation of, even when you can not create sleep as an actual samadhi, having or not having the ability to ascertain the corresponding voids of sleep of the base reality, of, even when you can create that, producing or not producing it in the reality of the voids of sleep, and of the genuine and spurious methods of creating that- this is a method of developing a rough understanding that is not misled about the key of the instruction of holding the clear light of sleep. The rest of them I will explain elsewhere in fine detail. [VI.B.3.b.ii.C '3 'd 'ii 'A \"1 \"b \"ii \"A '\"2 \"'-The dream merger] Thus, one who can merge the voids of sleep, having held the dream by the force of energy, when the voids of sleep arise in sequence, s/he can ascertain \"this and this is the luminance and so on of sleep.\" Thus, from the perspective of understanding the process of arisal of dreams after the clear light of sleep, you should well distinguish the boundary between the void of sleep and the arisal of dream. In that regard, [233al there is no need for any other method of recognizing dream as dream, and so Aryadeva did not state any other method of holding the dream than the method of holding the clear light of sleep. As for holding the dream, not being able thus to hold the dream by the force of energy, since one cannot hold the dream through the door of previously ascertaining the four voids of sleep, other methods of holding are explained from the personal instructions. Here, without requiring meditation on the path, from the base reality time itself, there are many times it happens that one recognizes dream as dream. Whatever activities one concentrates on with intense will repeatedly in the daytime usually come out also in the dream. By the key of that, it is not that difficult to develop the knowledge that the dream is a dream, and it is recommended that the cultivation of in­tense will in the daytime can lead to holding [consciously] the dream.

When sleep does come, if it is too deep, the dream will not emerge. In some cases where there is excessive habituation to mind focusing only in the daytime, there are no dreams. Or it can happen that even if there are dreams, one does not remember to say at the time of waking, though that is also less intense [as an obstruction]. If such problems should occur, one should use the methods to dispel them as given in the personal instructions, which will be easy if you know how to apply the reasoning behind them. Now, to hold the dream when it is not the case that sleep does not come and it is not the case that even with sleep coming dreams do not come, thinking that \"the current perceptions in the day [233hl are a dream,\" and especially creating the instinct that projects the strong intention \"I will recognize the dream as a dream,\" these are crucially important in order to awaken [to consciousness] within the context of the dream. In that case, if things do not bcome clear even when there are many dreams and they are enduring, that kind of instinct cannot have been awakened, so it is crucial that the dreams are clear. If the dreams are clear from the beginning, it is easy to hold them; if they are not clear there must be a method to make them clear. These are to aim the mind and so on at drops in the throat and mid-brow and so on. If one awakens [completely] when the dream had just been recognized or not long after it has been recog­nized, th is obstructs the virtuous practice of merging the dream. One needs to know a method for prolonging the dream. Many of these are not taught, [but] the main one depends on the statements from other Tantras that drops at the heart and jewel-tip centers cause deep sleep, at the throat and secret center below the navel cause dreams, and at the forehead and navel cause wakefulness. When you go to sleep, due to the intensity of the wind-energies collecting at the heart, the jewel sleep without dreams occurs, which stays that way as long as the drops stay there. When the binding of the wind-energies there opens up a bit, they go to the throat and the secret place, and the Community says the dream emerges. which lasts as long as they stay there or as shortly as they stay there. When the binding of the wind-energies there opens up a bit, they go to the other two places, and one begins to awaken.

In the instructions of the mentor Marpa, the heart center is the vital point for holding the clear light of sleep and the throat is the vital point for holding dream. As for the explanation of how greatly vital are these two vital points during sleep time and the meditation of the navel in furor-fire meditation while waking, it must be understood relying on the explanations above. As for the emphasis on the throat as the vital point for holding dreams, it intends the holding of the dream for one who cannot hold the dream that unholdable by the force of the wind-energies. At the time of equipoise, one aims the mind at the drop in the crown, explained [among the] two vital points for waking time. By that one who holds the dream by the force of will, though one cannot ascertain the sleep voids before the dream, when one practices by confirming the recogni­tion of dream, one can find in the Marpa system a special instruction for holding the four sleep voids during that occasion of dreaming. And if you can do that, having stabilized long familiarity with it during the sleep time, it gets easier to collect the wind-energies during waking time; this is a powerful side-effect for developing the four voids during waking time, which should enable you to understand this as a special exception of the above explanations. Thus, in the best case, you first develop the four sleep voids by the force of wind-energy and then you arise in the dream beatific body. Or in the worst [case], by the above-explained method you might develop [234bJ the sleep four voids, but if you do not know an instruction to merge the dream body with the dream arising in the beatific body, you don't have the superior essence of the instructions of the dream. The statements about the way the dream body arises in the beatific body from the experience of the sleep truth body, and once that happens, [the teaching] that you can definitely merge with the between, occur in the Five Point instruction of the Marpa system. The vital point here is extremely great. The later [teachers] engage with this without en­gaging the fine distinctions; and once they do engage, it is very hard for them to understand that there are the two distinctive systems of arisal; and that, especially, there is a system providing a distinctive certainty through the instruction of merging the [magic body with] the dream and merging the [magic body with the] between.

As for viewing visions of pure and impure objects, when you recognize the dream by some means other than recognizing the dream by force of dissolving wind-energies into the dhati channel, among good visionary experiences in waking time occur visions of pure lands and deities and so on. However, those are not the real deities, but merely virtual simulations of them, and the pure land visions are not real either but only simulations. As for the scriptural ref­erence establishing that, though they are stated in the Samadh i of Direct Experience of the Present Buddhas and so forth, 1235�• 1 fe aring prolixity I will not recite them. Although visionary objects seen in a dream recog­nized though the force of wind-energy are very much different from the above visions, until you reach a high degree of forceful ability of merger, though you might see the mere forms of pure lands and their inhabitants, it is [only simulation] as in the above case. Thus, though occasional unerr­ing clairvoyances about past and future might occur, many erroneous ones will also occur, it is hard to rely on them one-sidedly. As for stabilizing your habituation to recognizing the dream by force of wind-energy, it seems after a certain stage to be an excellent method for developing unerring clairvoyances about past and future. These non­principal distinctions about merging with the dream, though they are not explicit in the great authoritative treatises, seem to be helpful to contem­porary persons. As for thus holding dreams by force of wind-energy, it is the principal thing, so you must strive in that procedure. And as it seems very hard to develop this even if you strive, you should hold the dream with other procedures; and then strive further to stabilize those by holding it through the force of energy, and not rest content with just that [pro­gress made with the other procedures]. If you do not know the uncom­mon instructions of merging [the magic body] with the dream, you will not know how to achieve the realization of the metaphoric magic body which illustrates it in waking time.

Thus, [235bJ you should become expert in that, as explained above.

As for the merger of clear light with actual death, the Integrated Practices and the Illumination of the Lamp explain it as attaining buddha­hood in the between. You might wonder, \"Well, just how much realization of the path does that person attain here in this life?\" The Integrated Practices says, \"seeing the truth, realizing the per­fection stage, and understanding reality,\" and the Illumination of the Lamp says, \"realizing the process of perfection.\" The followers of Go explain [236aJ that the person [who attains buddhahood in the between] is one who has attained communion but not practiced it, calling such [a person] \"one who has abandoned birth but not death.\" However, the Third Stage [chapter of the Five Stages] states that if you attain the magic body you 128 Thi . . h . s mtention may ave resulted m Tsong Khapa's bsre ba dgu 'i gdams pa, TKSB, Zhol, Vo l. cha, no. 34."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Chapter V/ll- 1\\.vo Reality Perfection Stage · 445 will surely attain buddhahood in this very life, and the Second Stage [chapter] states: Having attained manifest enlightenment, [One] proceeds to the pure abodes, Not turned back from the buddhaverses, In this very life [one will become] omniscient. -that when you attain the fourth stage [manifest enlightenment, or clear light transparence], you will become a buddha in this life, [but] when you attain buddhahood in the between, magic body and clear light are not attained [in this life]. Further, it is said that attaining the fourth stage [of clear light], you purify the three luminances, which is to realize reality in intuitive experi­ence. If, as the Ultimate Continuum [by MaitreyaniUha] states: The noble one eradicates the miseries Of death, aging, and sickness; No longer born under power of evolution and addictions, He lives free of [the miseries of the life cycle]. -the Transcendence Universal Vehicle noble one abandons death under the power of evolution, what need is there to mention the Mantric Uni­versal Ve hicle noble one's abandoning it? [And after all,] this [Transcen­dence Ve hicle noble] one has not even [fully] abandoned death [itself] under the power of evolution.129 However, the Integrated Practices states that, of the two kinds [of noble ones] mentioned, one of them has no wealth of possessions for performing the [Tantric] conducts; but that [statement] is refuted by the statement [by Nagarjuna] that \"once you attain magic body, food and clothing are instantaneously obtained from the sky.\" The Bodhisattva Stages says that once you have attained the joy­ous stage you will never lack for possessions, and so a Universal Ve hicle noble being cannot be lacking in possessions, then that also refutes [the possibility that a noble one can be poor]. [Thus, the mind-isolation­realized mantric] practitioner cannot have attained either of the last two 129 Although Maitreya states that the miseries of death etc. are abandoned, evolution­dominated death itself is still driven by untamed instincts even in the noble one."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"446 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp [perfection] stages. Therefore, the meaning of saying \"seeing the truth\" [during mind isolation] [2 36bl is that, at the perfection of vajra recitation, one realizes the reality of thatness by the intuitive wisdom of mind iso­lation; since it does not follow that any experience of reality is a direct experience.130 Here again, the Integrated Practices explains that some are dis­tracted by farm work, trade, and devotional practices, and are not able to perform the conduct; others lack sufficient wealth and cannot perform the procedures according to the prescriptions in the Tantra, and [it further] explains by implication that since the conduct has not been performed those [persons] attain buddhahood in the between. This shows that if one can perform the conducts, one attains buddhahood in this life, so it is clear you must be ready to perform the conducts of the occasion of the perfection stage, and for that you must have at least the definite a ttain­ment of mind isolation. This [person] ready to perform the conducts, if slhe does not attain the magic body, knows that s/he must perform the conducts in order to attain the magic body. And if s/he does, the Vajra Rosary quote is pertinent: Knowing to separate instincts from luminance, Then [you] should perform the conducts. Abandoning the evolutionary body, [You] will attain the vajra body. Since this states that such a [person], if s/he does not perform the conducts, s!he won't attain buddhahood in this life, it shows that to attain buddhahood in this life, the conducts are definitely necessary and that to represent the conduct which is the art of achieving this magic body. you should perform [it] by taking the four voids of this life and the four voids of death to be the same. Therefore, in general. as in the case of the per­formance of the yogas of soul-ejection and body-possession, though the conducts are not needed to separate the coarse and subtle bodies by the force of meditation, the separation of the two bodies by habituation to the 130 Tsong Khapa uncharacteristically takes issue with Aryadeva's statement that one out of the two types of noble ones (attainers of the third path and first bodhisattva stage, and of the mind-isolation realization of the mind objective but not yet the magic body, respec­tively) lacks the wealth to pursue one of the three types of Tantric conduct."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII-Two Reality Perfection Stage· 447 samadhi that develops the four voids through the dissolving process by compressing the wind-energy-mind at the heart center, l2-' 7al and the crea­tion of that separated subtle body again into the magic vajradhara body adorned with all the signs, are extremely difficult to achieve; and so you must engage in the conducts for the sake of that achievement. Since such is the case, in regard to the merger of [clear light with] death, the Integrated Practices does not teach more than the mere trans­mitting of the projected will for the merger of death and ultimate reality. The fo llowers of Go very appropriately recommend merger through vajra recitation at the time of death, also using the visualization of the heart center indestructible and the arts of compression through the two con­templations. In regard to such performance, except that the actual process of dissolution, such as earth dissolving into water etc., developed from samadhi, becomes the dissolution process of the compression process of death, there is no other sort of death process [performance]. Therefore, at the time of the death clear light, the import of reality is not [yet] directly realized; because the magic body has not been realized up until then, and because the magic body definitely must be attained in a supporting em­bodiment that has the experiential realization of the objective clear light. And because the Five Stages states: The samadhi of self-consecration And likewise the state of clear light, Distinguished as effect and cause, Indicate the two realities. By the process of self-consecration, The clear light transparence is attained. And also because the Integrated Practices states: Apart from realizing superficial reality, you cannot directly realize ultimate reality. [237bl Here, the Integrated Practices mention of \"superficial reality\"- used in the expression of [the yogi/ni's] projected will \"This life is to be superfi­cial reality !\"-refers to the third stage magic body.

As for the way the magic body is realized, flrst you arise in the char­acteristic between state; it is not done after that. That very wind-energy­mind of the death clear light is what is born as the magic body; in another [procedure -a this-life magic body procedure -] it is that [very] wind­energy-mind that would have gone into the between that here [in this life] emerges as the magic body vajradhara body.131 Here some people think, first one achieves the full between state, then you meditate and transform the between body and it becomes the communion body. Others think that when you achieve the between, you meditate it as the vajradhara body. These both are at fault by not under­standing well the way of achieving the magic body. Here the Integrated Practices states: Truly understanding \"dying is ultimate reality and birth is superficial reality,\" at some point you develop a deter­mined mind, \"having entered clear light and abandoned the ordinary body, I shall arise by the stage of self­consecration!\" Put that in your mind and stay with it, and that impression will not quit even in another life; then you will become omniscient. Therefore it is said [in a Sotra]: By which and which intention, L238a] Humans truly apply their minds, 131 This discussion clearly presents the view that Tantric enlightenment is finally not about \"powering one's way\" to buddhahood, as it has often been misrepresented. In order to attain the special cause that accelerates the material buddha body to full evolutionary perfection, the practitioner has to fully go through death, either virtual or actual, which means a complete surrender of all egocentrist will, with the only ticket forward being a strongly projected will to emerge as embodying the universal love and compassion for all living beings, transmitted with determination in the time of complete surrender to the experiential annihilation of any controlling subjectivity."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII- Tw o Reality Perfection Stage· 449 That becomes their nature; Just as the varied [colors tinge the crystal] jewel. Thus, [Aryadeva] supports with a Sntra reference his contention that whatever willpower concerning the two realities is projected at the time of death, one will develop in that way. Since this does not refer to birth in coarse existence, \"birth\" in regard to the wind-energy-mind which be­comes the between in the case of another person, there is the projected will \"I must resurrect in the superficial magic body,\" and it is said one will achieve according to that projected will. So this must undoubtedly be accepted as the very wind-energy-mind of clear light not being born as a between being but being born as the superficial [reality] magic body vajradhara body. \"Well then,\" you might ask, \"if there is no between here, is it not unsuitable to refer to this as 'buddhahood in the between?\"' If that were [wrong], since there is no [real] clear light present in the imaginative visualization of compressing [wind-energy-mind] into clear light, and there is no [real] vajradhara in the creation of the primal savior through the five enlightenments, it would be wrong to use those expressions for those states; and there are many such parallel reasonings. Therefore, since just as there is a [kind of] between at the end of the death clear light, one attains buddhahood creating it from the mere wind­energy-mind, there is no contradiction in designating that as \"buddha­hood in the between.\" If you claim that buddhahood in the between is a practicing of the path after having achieved a full-fledged between after the clear light of death, you are in disagreement with both this system and the personal instructions. Further, by that vital key of attaining the third stage magic body at the end of the death clear light, since this person does not directly realize the reality of thatness at the time of the death clear light, s/he [231!bl attains buddhahood after having achieved the [third stage] magic body, and then [achieves] the two last stages in that embodiment. This way of achieving the magic body gives a great certainty also about the way of achieving the magic body in the process of buddhahood in this life. \"Well, in this case,\" [you might further object,] \"there is a connec­tion with the previously existent coarse body, so there is no such certainty about buddhahood in this life.\""},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"450 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp In such a case, even if one cannot last the measure of the between of forty-nine days, there is no point counting them, as, going into the pres­ence of the buddhas, one can listen to [their] personal instructions.

The three betweens are the existence between, the corresponding dream between, [and the path between]-and here many persons in the Marpa tradition interpret the meaning of the expression \"birth-death between\" as this present body from birth until death- however, taking the two base reality betweens and the one path betweenl34 as the third, 134 This seems to be the third stage magic body itself."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII- Two Reality Perfection Stage · 455 corresponds better with the father and sons' treatises. Further, in the Five Stages there are mentionings of the magic body as a between, in regard to which there are both actual and virtual understandings. As for the three deaths, there is the well-known death, there is the sleep-death, which is the sleep voids prior to the key explanation of the dream body as a between, and in the perfection stage there is the path death which is developed according to the base reality death dissolution process. 124lbJ Thus there are two base reality deaths and one path death. As for the three births [or lives], there is the birth maintained as womb-birth from the existence between, there is the waking-time birth when the dream betweener again enters into the coarse body, and there is the birth when the magic body betweener [re-enters and] maintains the coarse body. Thus there are two base births and one path birth. As for the first of those sets of three, the merger of between and beatific body is the magic body merger. As for the middle three, the mer­ger of death and the truth body is the clear light merger. And as for the final three, the merger of birth and the emanation body [is the magic body entering the coarse body or any other emanation for the sake of beings]. 135 In regard to those, if you synthesize them, they are called \"the three merger cycles.\" If you separate them, they are called \"the nine mergers.\" Here, relying on the explanation of the Concise Five Stages: By the energy of the furor-fire yoga, The mind objective is great bliss. Uniting dream and magic as one; You should merge the three betweens. Addictions become the path of wisdoms. The path of swift cutting is ejection, And body-possession is a branch. Serdingpa connected the furor meditation in the private instruction lit­erature of the Community with the five stages and also gave the private instructions of ejection and body possession. As for the explanation in 135 As TMJng Khapa out of reticence did not maintain the parallel of the previous two sets of three by equating a line of mergers ( d eath-truth body etc.) w ith a path. I supplied the bracketed emanation path from his immediately pre vious listing of the lhird hirth merger."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"456 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp the Concise Five Stages, in regard to meditating the furor-fire taught in the Yogini Tantras, it is claimed that it is taught in the terms substituted in the five stages of the Father Tantras. Doing it that way is in order to show how to synthesize all the paths of both types of Tantras, the actual five stages or their analogous [six branches or other stages]. Interpreting that way, the analogue of developing mind isolation by the wind-energies in vajra recitation [242al is the very same yoga of furor-fire. The analogue of mind isolation itself is the four joys of the great bliss derived from dissolving the wind-energies into the dhati channel depending on the meditation of furor-fire. Both of those do occur in the Mother Tantras. Thus the meaning <;>f that treatise is that one constitutes the five stages by adding [to the isolations' analogues] the Father Tantras' magic body, clear light, and communion; and it does not mean to explain things otherwise. \"Uniting dream and magic as one\" means that the personal instruc­tions about dreams should be combined with the personal instructions about the magic body. \"Between\" refers to the three mergers of the magic body. As for this very merging of the two base reality time betweens with the path between, it is in order to purify the impure, the latter referred to as \"addictions.\" If you do not attain the supreme in this life or in the between, then, having attaining a distinctively excellent embodiment for practicing Mantra in another life, the way of not prolonging that path is soul-ejection yoga, and body-possession is a d istinctively excellent branch of soul-ejection yoga. Those two are clear in the Yogini Tantras. Or else, body-possession is the branch of swift cutting the path by exchanging in this life one's own embodiment with another's embodiment because of differences of their qualities of good and bad. The reason for mentioning these two here, is to say, \"add those two to the Father Tantra.\" Or, since, once you are capable of creating the illustrative, metaphoric magic body of the Father Tantra, if you meditate the personal instruction of body­possession, you can develop a specia lly excellent ability, [the two are mentioned] in order to make that understood.

Since the achievement of the magic body is the uncommon dis­tinctive excellence of the unexcelled Mantra Vehicle, it is not claimed that such a magic body must be achieved merely as a prerequisite of the direct realization of the ultimate reality clear light.

This will now be explained in detail. In that regard, according to the systems of other vehicles, the reali­zation of voidness, chief cause of the wisdom truth body, serves as an interactive condition for the matter body, and the infinite store of merit, chief cause of the matter body, (243a] serves as an interactive condition for the truth body. Nevertheless, you do not travel the path by taking these two chief causes as art and wisdom indivisible in actuality and combining them into one in a concentrated samadhi. In the context of this unexcelled vehicle, I have already explained the unerring union of bliss and void and their union in one actuality with the magic body. And I have also already explained the import of how, though there is the similarity here in the mere general outline of the path of learning the six transcendences, having conceived the spirit of enlightenment, there is a distinctive way of learn­ing each of the separately categorized types of merit stores and there is a distinctive process wherein the realization of voidness is able to purify the objective obscurations. According to that vital key point: the quickest Individual Vehicle [practice] causes the exhaustion of the addictions with their seeds in three lifetimes; and in the Transcendence Vehicle, there are very different long and short timespans, such as the statements that it takes much time to attain the joyous stage where you directly realize the nature of reality, that the addictive obscurations are exhausted on the eighth stage, and that there are many different ways of abandoning and not abandoning addictions. Thus, in this path, the magic body is not created [only] in order to produce the intuitive wisdom which is just the direct realization of the reality of thatness by the orgasmic bliss. It is developed [also] in order to master the distinctive ability to purify the objective obscurations by the intuitive wisdom of objective clear light; since it is the chief cause of the uncommon matter body. Although when orgasmic (243bl bliss takes voidness as its object, there is a door for developing a distinctive ability to purify objective obscurations through that subjectivity, in this context of the perfection stage, the magic body is the substitute of the infinite stores of merit of the other vehicles. Recognizing the combination of those two is the ultimate vital key point. Thus, though the [various ways of] achieving the matter body are similar in the sense of enhancing the distinctive ability of the chief cause of the wisdom truth body to purify the objective obscurations, there is a"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Chapter IX- Ultimate Clear Light Transparence · 459 very great difference in regard to what you take as the chief causes of the two bodies. Thereby you can understand the difference between how on the other vehicles you attain the body adorned with signs and with that support you meditate only voidness in concentrated samadhi, and then, aroused by the buddhas, you engage in gathering the magnificent stores in the aftermath; and how in this context when you attain the magic body you do not have to proceed in that way. In regard to these reasons for confirming the sequence, without easily being satisfied, you must deeply investigate the general arrangement of the procedures of the path in the other vehicles, in the other Tantra classes, and in the two [categories of Unexcelled] Tantras, and all the subtle vital key points of those. For, due to the extreme difficulty of understanding it, there are many likely but spurious explanations about the magic body such as \"to purify the taints of holding magical illusion you must plunge it into the clear light!\" and so on. Therefore, the Fourth Stage [chapter of the Five Stages] states: This self-arisen Divine Lord, Alone is just the greatest of divinities; The vajra master is even greater, Since s/he bestows the personal instructions.

After that, as for the the Five Stages and the Integrated Practices declaration that the mentor confers the secret and third initiation pre­ceded by the nine initiations [of the vase initiation], if you have previ­ously attained once the initiation that makes you a fit vessel, a second initiation to become fit is not necessary.

The praises are the four and a half verses beginning with \"Liberated from the three realms ... \" After that praise, it is stated that the disciple petitions the men­tor with the three verses from \"Liberated from evolution and birth .... \" [244b] As for the reason behind the statement that you should praise and invite the mentor in harmony with the personal instructions in the con­texts of magic body and clear light, it is good to assert that you should meditate the mentor yoga, having also used it in the contexts of the other stages, and that you should pray with those procedures. Therefore, you should pray in that way not only on just the occasion of hearing the practical instructions but also on other occasions. Therefore, in general in all vehicles and in specific in this vehicle, you should not break your commitments to the mentor, you should make offerings while consider­ing him or her as a buddha, you should please him or her with all methods of propitiation and abandon all unpleasing things; this seems to be the superior vital point. 136 Here the PK verse Ch.

The first of these [systems] is the explanation of the four parts of the day as the four voids, which refers to the interpretable meaning, outer enlightenment, since it is the example of reality, the time, the sign, and the means of indication. The definitive meaning is the inner enlighten­ment; if you meditate by uniting with the consort, bringing the enlighten­ment spirit into the root, shaft, and vase of the vajra and sealing those three blisses with voids, then ensue the three path luminances and the universal (246aJ void clear light, when there is the wisdom of the bliss that eliminates the reality [habit grounded] instinctual constructs at the time of two drops releasing and two drops abiding.

If you analyze as before explained, those who dif­ferentiate outer and inner have no cogent answer, neither do the explana­tions of those who do not differentiate seem to have a cogent answer. This point is very hard to understand and seems to be important, so it must be investigated. It must be understood relying on the statements from the Illumination of the Lamp Fifteenth Chapter. The Root Ta ntra states: [With] a girl from the priest, warrior, Merchant lord, and commoner classes, You should practice as the vajra Dharma-lord. This is the means to attain the secret. When the vajra sun sets You should initiate all achievements. At the time when the dawn light arises, It will be achieved by the supreme meditation. Explaining the meaning of this, [246h] [Chandrak.Irti's] [Illumination of the Lamp] Commentary explains as follows: The perfection stage practi­tioner takes a fe male consort from either of the four castes; relying on her, the Dharma unbreakable as a vajra diamond is the perfection stage yoga. As for the nature of that, the practitioner endowed with that under­standing should achieve the means of attaining the vajr a secret that is Vajr adhara. And that must be perfected by means of the progression of manifest enlightenment. The method of that is shown by the four lines beginning with [the one containing] \"vajra.\" In that regard, as there are two processes of outer and inner enlight­enment, as for explaining the first; the vajr a sun is the actual sun. \"When it sets\" refers to the passing of the time when the red sun is cut off; you should propitiate the mentor with whatever possessions are at hand. Then when you have attained initiation by the kindness of the mentor at midnight, at the time of dawn, since the parts of the night that indicate luminance have passed, at the time just before sunrise, you are struck by the transmission of the process of clear enlightenment, and you will achieve it-meaning it will become pure.

Thus when luminance and radiance have set, you should initiate the imminence, the means of achieving clear light-that is, it emerges. Dawn arising is ignorance; when that is passed, the practitioners, by the cause and condition of the three voids, realize the supreme meditation that is the clear light, and thereby they will achieve the universal seal [embrace]. Here the universal seal [embrace] is [247al the communion [stage]. Since this is stated as the means of the direct realization of clear light, both outer and inner enlightenments should be applied to objective clear light. As for the reliance on the external seal [consort] in the occa­sion of the proximate cause of realizing that, it is the meaning of the first verse. As for the way of reliance, at midnight the mentor confers the initiation relying on the evolution seal, as a means of indicating clear light. After that, when hit by the personal instructions of the way of meditating predawn clear light and of the system of achieving commun­ion after that, you will attain objective clear light, and after that achieve communion. Thus, since the realization of objective clear light specially relates to the predawn time, it is called the outer enlightenment, and since the realization is accomplished by the process of the four inner voids it is called the inner enlightenment. Therefore, having taken the other three segments of time in a day as the other three voids, explained above in the mind isolation context, it is indicated by the examples of the sky of those times, and so there is no fault of being unable to differentiate outer and inner. The nonleamer's communion is also stated [by Nagarjuna] in Five Stages and [Aryadeva] in Integrated Practices as being attained in the predawn time.

In regard to that statement in the Five Stages and the In tegrated Practices, there are two contexts, one that of achieving basic fitness and the other that of having attained the magic body and having such an ability. The Illumination of the Lamp statement intends the latter context and is not made in terms of all such statements. A qualified dis­ciple will prepare for attaining the complete fitness initiation by develop­ing understanding from a complete explanation of the Tantra. A fully quali­fied mentor thoroughly develops in his spiritual process a realization of each phase of the path and so will explain the personal instructions that are developed in the disciple's spiritual process by the stages of the path teachings.

Just as the tala leaves become ashes, the art intuition causes purificat ion.

Of these, the former has already been explained; so here I will explain the two contemplations. Nagarjuna explains these in the Fourth Stage [chapter of the Five Stages] : The disciple who has gotten the private instruction, Then learns the two kinds of yoga: The processes of holistic holding And of serial dissolving. From the head or the feet, Until it reaches the heart center, The yogi/ni should enter the truth limit­That is called the holistic holding.

And [Aryadeva, in] the In tegrated Practices: Thus having realized directly universal voidness one should visualize the two contemplations through this stage. The procedure is as follows: As a lump [of snow] placed in an immaculate stream or pond, so the yogi/ni should gradually meditate a process of serial dissolving. S/he should regard it as like breath-vapor gradually fad­ing in a mirror. And also in the case of holding holisti­cally, s/he should visualize also in this stage. Here, as for \"having realized the fourth void and accomplishing the visu­alization in the two contemplations,\" it describes the realizations of the two enlightenments and the two contemplations, after what has already been explained. The two verses beginning with \"the disciple who has gotten the private instruction\" [249aJ refers to one who has gotten the private instruction and is in training. For that person, holistic holding proceeds \"reaching up to the heart center\" by compressing down from your head and up from your feet, [bringing] both ends into your heart center. Kan­hapa explains that you compress everything between your head and your feet into your heart center seed and that into a drop and that into the void. Thus compressing into the heart center the yogi/ni enters into the truth limit clear light transparence. As for the example of that, it is given by the four lines beginning with \"of the breath .... \" As the vapor smudge left on a mirror by breath collects from all its limits into the center, so you compress into the center of the heart center from the up and down, left and right, back and front of the body. As for dissolving, first you compress animate and inanimate into clear light and after that compress yourself into clear light. As for \"accord­ing to your nature\" is correctly explained by Kanhapa as performed in the same way as holistic holding. \"Again and again\" refers to the need for practicing those two repeatedly. The example of dissolving is the gradual melting of a ball of snow in a pond.

The verbal meaning of \"dissolving\" is as [already] explained. Abhaya explains that \"holistic\" refers to the body and \"holding\" to its being held by voidness. The body enters, or is held, into clear light. [249b] That the two contemplations both realize the objective clear light having made the heart center the final place of compression is the marvellous position of the Noble father and sons, as you must understand according to the many reasons already explained. In regard to this visualization of a process of compression, though it is not openly and clearly explained as a compression of wind-energy, you should understand that when you perform that visualization it in fact serves as the unexcelled wind-energy-compression process. Here, the Four Goddess Dialogue says: Always abide in the center of the heart, Endowed with the blaze of great light, Up to reaching the nine, Abiding in the forehead and down to the foot soles, Compress it all into that drop, Abiding in the center of that hub. Thus, from the \"brow,\" that is the head, down to the soles of the feet, everything is compressed into that very heart center drop, which means it states that you should make it stay in the hub of the lotus of the heart center. Therefore, in the speech isolation context, you must understand that all three meditations of life-energy control are methods of develop­ing the four voids by compressing the energies and light-spirits into the heart center. By the force of habituation to that, here by the process of compressing the sphere of vision, you cause the energy and enlighten­ment spirit to compress into the heart center and enter into clear light; and that is the reason why the two contemplations are stated as the medi­tation that is the method for the magic body yogi/ni to enter into clear light.

As for meditating Vairochana. Ak�hobhya and Amitayus, it means meditating Vairochana as the inseparability of the two bodies.

As for meditating the three, OM A/:1 HOM, in the heart centers of the three meditated devotee heroes, they are the wisdom hero. As for the mantra, OM is assigned as consciousness, the samadhi hero drop, HOM is assigned as the natural mind of the samadhi hero become a drop. and Al:l is assigned as the vajra of the samadhi hero, the natural mind become a drop. The yogi/ni who meditates in that manner injects his/her natural mind into the center of the cessation vajra, the clear light. Thereby, when s/he abandons meditating the drop and the ultimate clear light is devel­oped, s/he holds or achieves the supreme of all buddhas, becoming like a wish-fulfilling gem which fulfills all aspirations, endowed with the glory of both stores [of wisdom and merit]. As for this meditation of the indivisi­bility of your own body, speech, and mind and the three vajras of body, speech, and mind of all beings, it is the supreme commitment, superior to the creation stage, generating the intuitive wisdom which is understood by the private instruction which holds the commitment to the clear light transparence of cessation. Therefore, the Buddha, [25laJ that is the accom­plishments of the aggregates, free from the ordinary body, the profound, magnificent wisdom body, will be attained. Such is the explanation of the Illumination of the Lamp. Thus, having attained the magic body, for the sake of immersing your body, speech, and mind into the clear light, first you meditate, as triply nested, the body vajra, then the speech vajra, and then the mind vajra. You truly meditate not only the first two heroes, but also the samadhi hero as the drop, and thereby cause your own immersion in the clear light. The samadhi hero as the three drops is claimed by the followers of Go as being within the short A and the place of focus, the triangular drops. After that, the Ta ntra explains the meditation of the three vajras by the passage \"the vajra abides in the realm of space ... \" and so forth, which some people connect with the dissolving and the former holistic holding; since it is stated that the previous import is illuminated by the later statements by different expression, the previous meaning itself is divided into the two, the holistic holding and the dissolving.

KHAM is clear light. The Patsab and Chag translations explain that dissolving makes all things invisible and enters oneself therein gradually. Thus one's heart center seed radiates light rays that melt all animate and inanimate things into light, which mass of light gradually dissolves into oneself, making it also invisible. In general the OM letter is meditated on the crown and the Al:I on the throat, but here all three letters are stated to be meditated at the heart center; the reasons for which have already been stated, which does not accord with the meaning of Lak�hmi' s instruction to have the radiation and compression in the navel from the letter in the hub of the wheel established at the navel. As for the statement that, as the benefit of this, one attains the wisdom body free of the ordinary body, though one has attained a wisdom magic body separated from the ordinary body, it does not preclude one's attaining a previously unattained communion vajra body free from the ordinary body.

Although that body achieved as the magic body abides in the beatific vajradhara body, by habituating its repeated compression into clear light by the meditation as the emanation body of the three vajras, when the objective clear light is directly realized, the magic body also disappears like a rainbow in the sky. Further, the body achieved by the energy purified by the objective clear light is not eliminated at the time of direct realization of clear light, and there is the difference that this differs from the [body] achieved by the energy purified by the metaphoric clear light. Here, relying on the two contemplations and the seal [consort], at the time of repeating the fourth void, if you do not meditate by conjoin­ing as subject and object that bliss and the void of decisive insight into reality, however you accustom yourself to the four voids coming from the mere process of compressing the energy and mind, it is impossible to realize the objective clear light. Thus it is necessary to have the way of uniting bliss and void of the sages. And in that context, though many predawn-like clear skies may arise, purged of coarse dualistic appear­ance, the extremely subtle dualistic appearances will not be eliminated, and the direct realization of voidness coming from the one taste of the two things, subjective bliss and objective reality, will not arise. 1252bl Thus you must well distinguish between [real clear-transparence-purified com­munion bodies] and these conditions of the magic body which have not been purified in clear light. If you do not differentiate them properly, then you are likely to con­sider the dawnings of the three voids from the low state of not yet reach­ing mind isolation as the actual mind isolation; to consider the divine body that arises after that in mental experience as a transparent, very clear, rainbow-like, luminant body as the actual magic body; to consider as the actual clear light the state of obliteration of imaginative aiming that manifests with the thought of \"This is it!\" when you meditate the two contemplations and purify that body in the clear sky; and to consider that the arisal in a deity body after that is the actual communion. Those states are categorized as the virtual simulations of the four stages such as mind isolation, hence fit to be merely designated by their names in contexts where authentic and virtual are not distinguished.

Thus, in the Sotras and Tantras, whatever of the import of thatness reality [253bl is taught, it is explained that no other thing is expressed than univer­sal void clear light transparence.

Nevertheless, [the above statements intend] the teaching of the ultimate clear light which is the object of that intuition and the clear light of realizing thatness by the intuitive subjectivities other than great bliss as being what is taught by all the Sutras that teach thatness from the orientation of the transcendences and by the lower Tantras.

The four lines beginning with \"universal void\" makes more explicit \"he per­ceived thatness.\" The four lines beginning with \"vajra-like\" describe how he attained the non-learner's communion body in the pre-dawn twilight, the two lines beginning with \"enlightenment\" describe his conquest of the devils, and the four lines beginning with \"Shakya\" describe how he taught others, once he had attained the fruition.

Thus, since there is the dualistic perception error in the occasion of the three visions, that dualistic perception will not be eliminated until the erroneous instinct has been entirely purified.

First, at the end of the path of the Transcendence Vehicle, at the time of both the final existence before buddhahood in the beatific body embodiment in Akani�hta and the final existence before buddhahood in the emanation body in the desire realm, there are respec­tively the actual buddhahood through exhortation as explained above and the manifestation of the way of attaining buddhahood. Therefore, the latter is not a fresh buddhahood of someone who has not already attained buddhahood; and such a demonstration shows in general that an embodi­ment of a final existence of a tenth stage bodhisattva of the Transcen­dence Ve hicle must attain buddhahood by creating the Mantra path in their continuum. The Vajra Rosary Commentary states that the bodhisattva Siddhartha was initiated by the buddhas, once they had prepared and emanated the mandala; and [then, that by] relying on the teaching of three samadhis, the hundred clan body isolation, and the private instructions of the five stages, at midnight, [he attained] buddhahood; and at predawn, the devil conquest. This latter [explanation] contradicts both the Five Stages and the Integrated Practices, l257bJ contradicting their statements that at this time no other private instructions than those of the clear light transpar­ence and the communion were given. The followers of Go claim that the progression through the tran­scendence path up to the tenth stage is the substitute for creating in one's continuum the progression from the creation stage to the mind isolation, because the Five Stages states: By the beginner's yoga One should attain the eighth stage; And who sees the three luminances Is exalted on the tenth stage. Therefore, that final existence of the Transcendence Vehicle is equal to meditating onward from the magic body [stage]. In the evening receiving the secret initiation, the magic body is realized.

As for how one enters, it is not by rejecting one's own path, but rather by adding the Mantra path to that path; it being correct as the Go school maintains that in this case you do not need to create the progres­sion from the creation stage up to the mind isolation. As for the reason why you don't need the magic body of the third stage, you can under­stand that from the teaching of the reason why the person who engages in the Unexcelled Yoga from the beginning needs to achieve the magic body before s/he [2S8al can realize clear light. Having conferred the third initiation, there is mention of giving also the fourth; and those are the two initiations given. When the third initia­tion is given, the subtle dualisms of the prior experiences of luminance, radiance, and imminence, and the transition from imminence into clear light are purified and the objective orgasmic [bliss-wisdom] is realized. This bodhisattva had already realized reality from the first stage, but had not previously experienced directly the voidness with the orgasmic great bliss, which is what is created here. Then, meditating on that import, in the pre-dawn magic samadhi he is said to achieve the body characterised by the examples of magic, such as water moon; which means he attained the orgasmic intuition of objective clear light and the mere energy on which it rides, the totally pure magic body of the non-learner's communion. In the Transcendence Ve hicle, one attains the body adorned with the signs from the first stage and, at the end of the progressive improve­ment of the stages, one attains the culmination of the learner's signs by that method. But by the unexcelled art, by reason of not attaining the non­learner's matter body by just that, one must first create the basis on which that body is achieved, t he extraordinary clear light intuition along with its wind-energy. Knowing this, you can well understand whether you can achieve or not the magic body [just] from the evolution of the coarse body in the occasion of the third stage and the learner's communion. There­fore, until you have meditated on the direct realization of the import of thatness with the orgasmic great bliss, you will not attain the truth body that completely abandons the objective obscurations. 125Khl And until you have attained the magic body from the mere wind-energy-mind cultivated"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"4M4 · Brilliant Illumination r�f the Lamp by the objective clear light. you will not attain the non-learner's matter body. Since these are taught. that teaches that the union of bliss and void and the achievement of the magic body are the ultimate essence of the unexcelled vehicle and these two are the two extraordinary causes of the two bodies. In this context, that very meditation relying on the consort of the third initiation substitutes for the conduct, and so the reason that he did not need to learn the other three conducts can be understood by the previ­ous reason. Likewise, these are the means to understand how the confer­ral of the two final initiations without having previously conferred the vase initiation and the secret initiation, and this creation of the two final stages without having first created the [unexcelled] path below the third stage magic body, are exceptions to the rule. So that the previously explained sequence of the two stages, the determination of the number needed, the fact that the Mantra path needs the embodiment of the desire realm, and the necessity of the passion of the union of the two organs, are all taught in terms of the definite category of practitioner who enters the unexcelled path from the beginning. As for the statements such as that the desire realm deities and so on never emit the jasmine-like enlightenment spirit, they intend ordinary desire realm and matter realm gods and do not intend exceptional embodiments such as that of the final existence bodhisattva. Just as one can postulate three temporary definite categories without postulating the definite categories of the ultimate three vehicles, though one enters the unexcelled path at the end of the Transcendence Vehicle, this does not contradict [259aJ one's being definitely categorized by one's own path prior to the tenth stage. Though arhat saints and non-regressors are free of attachment to food and clothing, they can purposefully wish for food and clothing. Tenth stage bodhisattvas have ended addictions and so have ended craving for the bliss of sexual union; yet this does not prevent them from producing the purposeful desire for that bliss. Other­wise, since the outsiders hold that where there is desire there is passionate attachment, it would not refute [the view] that any one speaking a w ord must be counted as one passionately attached. Therefore, to hold that \"since the Analysis of Tradition142 explains separately the causes of making 142 lung rnam 'byed, identified with the Vinaya-vibhan ga(see Blue Annals, I, 36; II, 490)."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Chapter IX - Ultimate Clear Light Transparence · 485 fit a [sexual] organ to be free or not to be free from attachment to desire, so therefore it is impossible for one who has terminated craving for sense objects to rely on a consort!\"-this is an opinion that betrays a lack of learning whether in Mantra or in Transcendence [Vehicle literatures]. As for the two paths, [one being], at the end of three incalculable aeons on the Transcendence Vehicle, then to rely on the Mantra path and reach the universal illumination eleventh stage of buddhahood, and [the other being] to enter the Mantra Vehicle from the beginning and thus reach the univeral illumination stage of buddhahood in a single lifetime, though neither is inferior to the other [intrins�cally]. that doesn't mean that the difference between the two paths is negligible; since it is obvious that there is a great difference of distance [in time], and another path must be added finally to the Transcendence Vehicle path.

So the Yoga Tantra method distinguishes its own path and others' path, and the previously explained connection with the transcendence path does not appear, and further, neither does the other procedure of buddhahood at the end of one's own path. So you should wonder whether the interpre­tation of one's own path is the above explained consummation of the stage attaining buddhahood after exhortation by the buddhas- this should be well examined. According to the Unexcelled Tantras, those two additions [creation and perfection stages] to the above-explained path, if not generated in one's continuum, cannot produce buddhahood, and since those two are absent from the path of the three lower Tantras, they must be added as well to those who have engaged in the paths of the three other Tantras. As for the intended basis of the two [Unexcelled] Tantras' statements about buddhahood relying on the five illuminations such as moon and vajra when the stages are consummated, it seems it must be taken as [equivalent"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Chapter IX - Ultimate Clear Light Transparence · 487 to] the Five Stages' statement that in place of the creation stage person's creating the mantra body through the moon and vajra and so on, the per­fection stage person creates the totally pure deity body from the four voids. Thus interpreting it, that import which is thought of as the intended basis of the statement, though it is distinctive to the Unexcelled Yoga, that does not prevent it from serving in the lower Tantra's path as the literal import thought of while taught in other words. In many contexts here, this [principle] seems to be very necessary I260hJ in commenting on scrip­tural statements. As for this analysis of the way the main things of the perfection stage of this tradition serve at the end of other paths, it discovers the exceptional certitude about the chief distinctive excellences of our path. Relying on it you can become certain about the power of the reason of this path, so it seems the marvelous cause of the art of not regressing into other paths.

Go's translation, right after the complete explanation of the passage from \"independent\" to \"radiate out,\" is the statement \"those are the endurance branch, the fourth.\" Thus all these treatises take this as the authority for the endurance l26la] branch, and the Chag translation also does. Thus, though there seem to be two [versions] in the Indian text, the Go translation is understood to be preferable from the explanation in the commentary. As for oneself, both the visible objects and so on and the eye organ and so on cease and dissolve, and after that the jewel, i.e. the object, as [coarse] mind along with life-energy ceases and declines, is held, and that [jewel] is the reality-limit, clear light. As for mind dissolving along with life-energy, it is the sequential dissolving of the three minds [lumi­nance and so on]. Sense organ and object dissolving happens according to the death process. As the Elixir Secret states, \"independence\" refers to isolation from ordinariness, and the \"jewel\" is the jewel wisdom-intuition of buddhahood, which knows the mind's isolation from subject and object and the fault of not realizing that isolation from the mind's roaming in the life cycle by clinging to subjects and objects. \"It is explained as hold­ing the object of ceasing ... \" refers to not experiencing the meaning of \"teach the mind isolation,\" [or experiencing many imports of] the mind being isolated through the yoga of the three luminances arising from the vajra and lotus entering union and the enlightenment spirit arriving in the root, stalk, and tip [of the vajra organ]. \"The cessation vajra\" is clear light, and the \"mind becoming that\" means going there. Entering there, one per­ceives the signs such as mirage and so on, thus the signs are experienced and are produced. The signs appearing are said to be fivefold, three per­ceptions from mirage up to fire flies, arising from the four, earth, water, fire, and wind 126lhl dissolving one into another. \"Sky-light\" (khadyota) means fireflies as Patsab correctly translated, and is not correctly under­stood as seeing ripples in the sky. From among the movement into the three total iillminations of the subtle realm, the arisal of butter-lamp flame is the subtle realm mentioned in the Illumination of the Lamp, which is the energy that intensely moves the natural instincts, and when that dis­solves, a vision arises like a butter lamp flame not being agitated by the wind-energy."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Chapter IX- Ultimate Clear Light Transparence· 489 As for the Integrated Practices statement: The aggregates and so on enter into the subtle realm.

The former is a coarse arrangement and the latter is a subtle analysis arrangement. For example, it is like the Te rminal Action Investigation and the Vajra Rosary statement about consciousness, not analyzed into three, entering into clear light, and the Integrated Prac­tices analyzing them into three and mentioning imminence as subsiding into brilliant clear light. Most of the old translations have the final natural total illumination come into the cloudless sky, with the statement \"becom­ing constant illumination, mere clear light is fifth.\" Compared to some texts' and some translations' \"dissolving into total illumination,\" the former is correct, since for clear light to arise the three luminances must dissolve.

When the genuine intuition of the three voids of the path is produced, whatever is experienced appearing as an object is perceived as like moonlight, undivided in any direction, but it is not the perception of a specific round orb, as moonlight-likeness and so on is the perception of moonlight-likeness that arises at the time of the three voids' intuition.

He also explains that thirteenth stage intended by the Vajra Rosary Ta ntra' s is the stage of clear light. Accord­ing to this, the communion [stage] must be taken as the fourteenth level. Concerning this, in the Transcendence Universal Vehicle it is fre­quently stated that the learning levels for the nobles are the ten stages such as the extremely joyous, and the nonleaming [level] is the eleventh, the all-luminous; and there is also a mention of the alienated individual's positive orientation and beginner's levels. From the Mantra [systems], there are enumerations of twelve, thirteen, [266a] and fourteen.

The Sheaf of Instructions and other such works explain that the positive orientation and all-luminous levels are included by implication, but I wonder if this latter [arrangement] is maybe the same as the previously mentioned twelve stages.

The Illumination of the Lamp gives the meaning of this as \"the ten stages are the ten light rays, where one totally abides.\" And this ten stages should be taken as the extremely joyous and so on, the [usual] ten. The creation stage is stated to lead to the attainment of the eighth level and the vajra recitation also. Of these the first can be understood as referring to the bare attainment of the eighth level, and the second should be understood as connecting to the ninth level, as exemplified by the transcendence eighth level, intending that the perfection stage body isolation is categorized within the vajra recitation. The Five Stages explains that by experiencing the three lumi­nances one abides on the tenth level [266bl and the Integrated Practices has a second statement that by realizing body, speech, and mind one attains the tenth level. These two can be taken as the same in meaning, as the sixth chapter of the Illumination of the Lamp explains that body, speech, and mind, are luminance, radiance, and imminence. All of this connects mind isolation with the tenth [bodhisattva] level. Kanhapa, in comment on connecting the experience of the three lumi­nances with the tenth level, explains it as attaining the self-consecration, which can be taken as attaining the magic body relying on mind isolation; and connecting that with the tenth level is the import of the Integrated Practices. That adds some upper part to the transcendence tenth level. As for placing the clear light [stage] and learner's communion [stage] below the tenth stage, it is understood by the previous explanation of the system of adding the unexcelled path upon the ten stages of the transcendences, whereby placing the nonleamer's communion stage in the eleventh all­luminous is also understood. As for the two Tantras explaining clear light as the thirteenth level, it depends on counting the positive orientation level, and also is exempli­fied by the learner's communion.

Or are they connected from the per­spective of some corresponding qualities of similarity, like connecting each of the fourteen levels with intiations conferred, connecting the five paths to a single session of a creative contemplational performance, or connecting the three bodies to the visualization of contracting into clear light? Though you attain the third stage magic body, if you do not realize clear light, since it is stated that you eliminate cycling under the power of addictions, just by the fact that the path has been consummated l2ti7al in its own context, it is not only that you do not attain the tenth level, you do not even attain the noble level. Hence, those ways of connecting do not imply that you attain by the way of perfecting the qualities of the levels such as the extremely joyous. There seem to be many other fatal flaws in the position that consummating the creation stage leads to the actual attainment of the immovable level. Therefore, the proceeding to the tenth level by means of the Transcendence Ve hicle is explained as being substituted for by proceeding from the creation stage of this path to the magic body stage. Accordingly, these paths of this vehicle can substi­tute for proceeding up to that stage by other vehicles for buddhahood. Thus it is said when these [mantric] paths are attained, one has attained up to the tenth level, and it is not necessary for it to be attained in a com­plete mutual matching up of the qualities of the paths. Further, the creation stage is the means of evolving toward the complete generation of the realization of the perfection stage, and the developing of the last of that is like just barely attaining the eighth level.

Furthermore, when you finalize the creation stage, in ordinary [reality] you can enter at will into an extremely stable nonconceptual samadhi and attain total purity of perception of animate and inanimate worlds as measureless mansion and deities; and this is just like the eighth bodhisattva level. With that as preliminary, relying on body isolation and then moving to practice speech isolation, as the Integrated Practices says, you can accurately attain the tolerance of the birthlessness of things.

Just as on the tenth level, you complete the stores of the path that cause·you to have the powerful ability to overcome the obscurations to the realization of voidness and you have nothing new to learn on your own path, so depending on attaining the magic body you enter into clear light. Also, since subsequently attaining communion is similar to that [tenth level], those stages are connected to the tenth level. Paths are dividing into [those of the] alienated individual and [those of the] noble based on whether one has or has not attained the noble levels by realizing or not realizing reality directly. If you make the alienated indi­vidual paths into the two, of accumulation and of application, and so begin from the common paths, as long as one cannot develop direct experi­ence of the void by forcing the wind-energies into the dhati by the power of meditation and dissolving them there, one is on the accumulation path. When one can do that, it becomes the application path up until [having become] a magic body one still cannot realize directly thatness through bliss. Then, until one attains communion by means of the objective clear light, it is taken as the vision path and the joyous level.

To not clearly realize [ultimate reality] means to not directly realize [it]. Not realizing in such a way, one cannot completely abandon the seeds of the addictions, thus cannot abandon birth under the power of addictions; which means that rebirth continues to take place by the continuum of the instincts of the addictions. These instincts are the seeds of the addictions, and not the instincts that are posited as objective obscurations. When the magic body is attained, it is certain that buddhahood will be attained in that very lifetime. Therefore, though it is not that there will again be birth under the power of evolution in the life cycle, \"if thatness is not directly realized\" is setting a hypothetical limiting case; as for example, saying that if Shuddhodhana's son Siddhartha had not renounced the home life he would have become a universal monarch. Thereby it shows that until one attains the fourth stage one does not directly realize the import of thatness. In that context, when the three luminances are purified, even subtle dualistic perception is purified, and intuitive wisdom enters into experiential unity with the reality of thatness just like water flowing into water. As the Integrated Practices states just after the previous quote: When one is free from any other thoughts, that is the state of purity ... citing as evidence the Glorious Supreme Prime statement that the place of purifying the three poisons is the place of the spirit of enlightenment, and quoting the statement of Master Kambala that, as a method of achieving the inner reality; Freedom from the coarse nature of sound, from the subtle nature of thought or intention, [268bJ and from [all] thoughts and intentions, that is the place of the supreme of yogi/nis.

In the [Five Stages'] Second Stage, just after mentioning the con­nection between the creation stage and the eighth level and that one attains the tenth level by means of the three luminances, [Nagarjuna] states that: Having attained perfect enlightenment, One fully realizes the pure abode, Irreversible here in this life, One becomes omniscient in the buddhaverse. He indicates that through the clear light [stage] one becomes nonregress­ing, implying [one could] regress before that.

[You may well] wonder, \"What is the reason that in this vehicle once one has directly realized the thatness reality, one is liberated from rebirth controlled by evolution and addiction?\" [The Integrated Practices] gives the reason just after the previous quote from Kambala: Wherefore, by this reason, by this stage of clear enlight­enment, one truly attains clear light, the taintless [269�1 nature of one's body, speech, and mind becomes uni­versal voidness-the reality of transcendent wisdom that purifies the three consciousnesses, and that thought-free and inexpressible condition is the realm of nirvana, form­less, hard to know, delivered from evolution and birth, extremely clear like the light of sun, moon, fire, and jewels. \"Wherefore by this reason\" refers to the process of the art of plunging the three luminances into clear light.

Such being the case, the insight path practitioners of the Transcen­dence Ve hicle and of the Individual Ve hicle do not differ in regard to their realization of thatness. Yet the universalist practitioner, once s/he has that [realization], is able to block regression into the life cycle under the influ­ence of evolution and also obtains twelve hundred excellent qualities, while the individualist does not come to have these things.

Therefore, it is stated that the fourth [270aJ stage clear light wisdom­intuition abandons the seeds of addictions, and since there are no con­taminations left in the subsequent attaining of communion, those seeds of addictions are the \"instincts\" referred to in the stated excellent quality of \"liberation from all instincts of addictions.\" Thus they should not be taken as merely conscious addictions, but are [also] the instinctual addictions. The objective self habits explained as objective obscurations by other systems, and not only those but the more subtle instinctual objective self habits considered to be addictive [obscurtions] by the Noble father and sons-as for those, I have already extensively settled them in other works such as the Discrimination between Interpretable and Definitive.

In comment on that, the Illumination of tlze Lamp explains that this state­ment shows that this vehicle is distinctive from all others in its art of pro­ducing the vajra body from clear light; that \"all transcendent buddhas\" refers to universal voidness, \"vajra\" refers to great voidness, \"commit­ment\" refers to extreme voidness, and \"accurately understanding\" after the three is voidness. \"Going\" is the going into ultimate reality by the process of those three voids. \"Coming\" is the coming through the three voids in the reverse order. \"And so on\" is explained as indicating that there is no going and coming of entering [reality] and resurrecting in the context of the perfection [stage]. This teaches that there is no going and coming in the arisal of the three voids in reverse order in the context of [first] achieving communion and in the forward and reverse order of the four voids in the context of the nonlearner['s communion]. The [Five Stages'] Second Stage also has a quote, already cited, that explains the arisal of the three intuitions from clear light in the context of achieving the communion [body]. Here, you might argue as follows: \"Is the communion body achieved immediately upon arising from the objective clear light of the fourth stage? Or is it not? If it is, then it contradicts the previous quote 1271al that states that the three voids arise in the reverse order from the clear light of the occasion of achieving communion; for if the communion body were not achieved from the wind-energy-mind of the three voids arising in the reverse order, then there would be no point in such an explanation. And the explanation of the magic body as achieved from the three luminances along with their wind-energies during the third stage would be incorrect; since the three luminances are required as the cause of achieving that, and a distinction of not requiring them would be incorrect. [On the other hand], if [the communion body] is not achieved in that way, and, not being achieved immediately upon arising from the fourth stage objective clear light, but only after the three voids in the reverse order have already arisen, it necessarily means that it is achieved from the mere wind-energy-mind"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"�06 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of the first void: and so what is the point of mentioning that \"it is achieved from the three voids?\" The Integrated Practices statement that the \"four voids become one\" would become meaningless: since the objective clear light does not exist during the first luminance or its immediate aftermath, the attainment of union would become incorrect; and the process of purifying the achieved between state without any other obstruction after the clear light of death would be contradicted. If you claim that commu­nion is achieved at the time of once again entering clear light after the last luminance, it contradicts the Five Stages' statement: Arising from the truth limit One will attain the nondual intuition; and also the many statements of the Integrated Practices and the Illumi­nation of the Lamp that communion is achieved upon arising from clear light. And if it is achieved upon arising from that, then the previous many faults obtain. Thus, you must explain what is this transition where the communion body f27Ibl is achieved from clear light. [To respond:] In order to understand well the communion [stage], the chief subject of the Glorious Community, you must first understand conclusively the process of achieving the learner's communion. To that end, by having set forth the above doubts, you can eliminate doubts that could possibly arise concerning other final points-this being necessary, [this inquiry] is very good. In regard to this, the followers of the father and son, commentators on the Five Stages and so on, do not seem to make such a determination. However, Master Go, relying on the above-taught explanation of the voids in the reverse order, explains that the communion body is achieved from the three luminances along with their wind-energies arising from the clear light in the reverse order, and Lak�hmi also explains a procedure wherein the magic body is achieved from the voids arising in the reverse order. Accordingly I have set it forth in that way in another treatise. 145 However, we should determine this difficult point in fine detail. The Five Stages states: 145 The Great Stages of the Mantric Path, its final chapter on the perfection strage."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Chapter X-Communion · 507 The aim of beings may sometimes be [realized] By the process of the self-consecration, Which yokes consciousness with wind-energy. And releases corresponding light rays. Just as from clear stream water, The fish leap up so swiftly, So from the universal void clear light The net of magic expresses itself. Thus, this body also emerges from the mere wind-energy-mind through the process of self-consecration. As for the meaning of the example wherein the pure magic body emerges like a fish suddenly leaping from clear light transparence like clear stream water, it is employed to illus­trate that it arises from clear light [272aJ without being obstructed by any­thing else. As the Integrated Practices states that, as for the sleep used in the example taught of awakening suddenly from deep sleep, it illustrates clear light, and the awakening is the example for the emergence of the communion body. This also highlights non-obstruction. And as for the four voids becoming one, this fits with the fact that at the emergent order time, the former dissolves into the latter and finally all go into the clear light as one, and does not fit with the reverse order. This is extremely in agreement with the process of the purified base reality, wherein immedi­ately after the death clear light transparence the between is achieved together with the [reverse order] imminence. Hence the communion body is achieved immediately after resurrecting from the fourth stage objective clear light. This still does not contradict the above birth of imminence and so on from clear light. So, though it is stated that in the time of achieving the communion body the three voids emerge in the reverse order, that is not stated for the purpose of achieving that body. Here one might object that \"Is not communion the simultaneous combination of the objective clear light mind and the pure magic body? Though it is posited that the pure magic body is achieved immediately after arising from the fourth stage clear light, how can it be posited as the [perfect] communion, since at that time there is no direct realization of the clear light intuition?\" True enough! In this regard one must understand the many Five Stages explanations of the process of attaining communion, which explain twenty-one communions, running from:"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"508 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp up to: Abandoning the two notions Of life cycle and liberation, When all becomes one reality­That is said to be communion ...

Here taking the verse \"the holistic contemplation ... \" to indicate two com­munions, and the verse \"equipoise ... \" to indicate two communions, it is also correct to interpret these passages as teaching twenty-three commun­ions. As for the main communion thus explained, as the Chag translation reads: The knower of thatness sequentially Understands self-consecration and clear light; And when just those become united, This is the stage of communion. the pair here is self-consecration and clear light, and their coming together is explained to be communion. Further, his translation reads: Having critically understood apart, The superficial and the ultimate, When you truly commingle the two, That is pronounced to be \"communion.\" indicating that the pair here consists of the superficial and the ultimate, and their mingling is explained to be the communion. In that regard, before attaining objective clear light, when the magic body achieved from the five energies' light rays is present, the mind is not the clear light of the same taste as ultimate reality. Before attaining communion, when the clear light of the same taste as the bliss­mind ultimate reality is present, there is no superficial reality body that serves as the magic body. Thus there is no communion since these two [realities] are merely alternating. When the body is consummated as the superficial reality magic body called \"self-consecration,\" and the mind is"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"Chapter X-Communion · 509 consummated as the \"clear light\" ultimate reality, and these combine at one time in one continuum, coming together equally without alternation, then communion is attained.146 When the main communion of that kind [273a] is first attained, though it is required that those two be combined, there are still other ways of positing it as communion; so any kind of communion attainment need not be posited as achieved by that way of positing. The Sanskrit for communion is yuganadva, where yuga is a pair and adva is nondual;147 interpreting that as meaning that the two mates [of the pair] are not separate through a process of alternation but are complete at one time-[such] is the above-explained communion. This will be attained when once again entering clear light after arising from the final luminance of the reverse order. The Five Stages often mentions the communion that becomes nondual undisturbed by any ideas, having abandoned dualistic instinctual notions in regard to dual­isms such as life cycle and liberation- this is an example of another way of positing a communion different from the previous way. Taking it that those dualistic ideas subside in the face of the direct realization of the import of thatness, it is already attained from the time of the fourth stage clear light. Thus it is incorrect to say that it is inevitable that this kind of communion must be achieved relying on that being previously present. If you take it that one must have totally abandoned whatever kinds of notions, then that would not be attained until one attained the nonleamer's communion, and that does not fit with the learner's communion. There­fo re, communion in this context is just the nondual intuition that abandons 146 This explanation so much reminds me of Tsong Khapa's explanation of the realistic view in the Three Principles of the Path, I cannot resist quoting it as an example of how Tsong Khapa's understanding of these profound perfection stage attainments influences the way he teaches the exoteric Dialecticist Centrist view: \"Appearance inevitably relative, and voidness free from all assertions-as long as these are understood apart, the Victor's intent is not yet known. But when they coincide not alternating. mere sight of inevitable relativity secures knowledge beyond objectivisms-and investigation of the view is perfect. More, as experience dispels absolutism, and voidness clears away nihilism, you know how voidness dawns as cause and effect-then you will not be deprived by extremist views.\" 147 Here Tsong Khapa seems to mist ake the Sanskrit naddha (deriving from naddha \"binding\") for nadva or even adva (deriving from nondual).

And that is not abandoned at the time of the fourth stage. At the time of the first attainment of the learner's communion, it is posited as abandon­ing unconscious addictions. When such a clear light is realized, one can remain evenly entranced for a long time-it is not like you get no [water] from the first water-scoop; 148 since, if even before that one can focus for a long time on the exemplary clear light, what need is there to discuss [one's ability to focus on] the objective clear light?

As for the meaning of the passage from \"the store of luminance\" up to \"having illuminated,'' the light rays of the body achieved from the clear light wind-energy-mind fill the world-realm, just as the sun illuminates the realm of space. As is stated in the Illumination of the Lamp Fifteenth Chapter-in the context of elucidating the achievement of communion as previously explained, after manifesting the objective clear light of the predawn twilight - the Tantra 's statement that the light rays shine only a hundred leagues around is merely for illustration, and so it is said that light illuminates the world even throughout the billion world universe. As for the statement that there is where one obtains the ten strengths and so on, this should be interpreted appropriate! y as intending the simulation [of the attainment] during the learner's communion and the actual attainment during the nonlearner's communion.

As for the [communion bodies'] lack of [further] soul-migration, having attained that body, its homogeneous [further emanations] can manifest without interruption; [since] this is the attainment of the fully character­ized vajra body [of a buddha]. As for its being uncontaminated and so on, it is the abolition of all addictions. The Illumination of the Lamp states that for the nonleamer's [com­munion] there is no coming back from clear light in the three voids of the reverse order; hence here these things explained in the context of arising in the reverse order should be interpreted as referring to the Ieamer's communion.

[So,] as for the Illumination of the Lamp Eleventh Chapter statement that, past the attainment of commun­ion, you maintain an emanation body that is visible to the ordinary eye, though there are other ways of maintaining an emanation body, a main­taining of an emanation body that enters into the old body is hard to understand as being [just] like a between being's entering the womb and being seen by everyone after being born outside. Hence, it should be understood as something [built up] upon that [old gross body]. That is what is meant by the Illumination of the Lamp First Chapter's statement, \"Having attained communion, entering into the processes and so forth, you maintain [the old body as] the emanation body.\" Because, the Illumi­nation of the Lamp also states that \"the totally pure deity body abides in the jewel sack of the body\"; and Nagabodhi also states: The true savior, striving In thatness, stays hidden In the jewel sack of the body. Therefore, [275al though the ordinary person does not perceive the range of an irreversible communion body bodhisattva such as Nagarjuna, [such] ordinary persons can see their former [gross] body.

Further, if you wonder, \"Therefore, as for the insistence that the true insight of mindfulness is produced from clear light, and not else­where, as there is emergent order and reverse order in the entering into clear light, in the context of which is mindfulness discussed?\" It must be that since it is explained in the order of resurrecting in the reverse order from clear light, [the phrase \"it is not elsewhere\"] is explained in order to make certain that this does not occur otherwise in the emergent order. So one must explain this instruction of the Illumina­tion of the Lamp in conformity with the explanation of the Integrated Practices. \"Art\" is the magic body which is the purity of the superficial reality, and \"wisdom\" is stated to be the ultimate reality, it being the clear light intuition that is of one taste with that [reality]. \"Uniting together\" is uniting indivisibly in actuality.

Again from the Root Ta ntra: Keeping body, speech, and mind In happiness, enlightenment is attained. Otherwise one will surely die an untimely death And will [eventually] be burned in hell. Here the meaning of the previous [lines], the benefits of blissful conduct, is implicitly shown by the last two [lines], while they explicitly indicate the dangers of maintaining ascetical conduct. As for that, some part explains the faults of the ascetical conduct of the fundamentalists, and some part explains the faults of incurring the eighth root transgression of maintaining an ascetical conduct, abandon­ing what one understands of the reality, [after] having received initiations and taking vows. As for the unexcelled path's affording enlightenment in this life­time, it depends on the union of bliss and void, and that bliss comes from the flourishing of the enlightenment spirit in one's body, and for that one must take care of one's body along with the senses and their supports. For that purpose is taught the conduct 1279bl wherein the five senses rely on the five objects as one desires. The Illumination of the Lamp Seventeenth Chapter states that what­ever commitments exist, [are fulfilled through] women [or male] consorts such as the \"lotusful,\" and so on. They are [essential] for the commit­ment of the three vajras, and you should respect and delight in them by all activities of body, speech, and mind. \"Don't despise the mind vajra\" intends that their minds should not separate from passion, since the mind is the root of the body, and since the body is the root of the spirit of enlightenment. Relying on the body of the \"lotusful,\" and so on, one's enlighten­ment spirit increases; and since the root of the body of that one is the mind of that, if that mind is eradicated, the cause of the root of great bliss is injured, and the text thus intends that this causes obstruction to the increase of the great bliss samadhi. Therefore it states that one should protect such a mind. And the infraction of the fourteenth root transgres­sion intends that same thing. By that reason you should understand not to harm your body but to make it thrive.

Thus, as stated, one should fo llow the conduct of the six transcen­dences, though there are statements that one's conduct should accord with one's path. Here, \"conduct\" refers to conduct from the perspective of knowing the nature of the fi ve sense objects as the cause of great bliss. Therefore, if you do not live blissfully in body speech and mind through sense-enjoyments, you will not attain one-pointedness of mind, and your mentality will not become evenly entranced, and so you must keep [.:!.ll llnJ a conduct of bliss for that purpose. And that statement is not just for achieving a mere stability of one-pointed mental equanimity, but is for the purpose of achieving the samadhi of orgasmic great bliss.

If they know the reality, those energies could become the cause for enlightenment. The Glorious Supreme Prime says: Desire, hate, and delusion, Holding them they become poisons. When the poisons are eradicated, Poison has been made poisonless. Relying on them with an elixir process, They become elixir itself. The Jewel Heap Satra says that just as the city's manure enriches the fields of sugar cane, the manure of the bodhisattvas' addictions enrich their becoming enlightened. And [it also says that] just as poison com­bined with medicine and mantra is no longer able to kill, 1280b] so addictions combined with art and wisdom are not able to cause wrong downfalls. The Discipline Amoghasiddhi Ta ntra also says: \"That which binds the foolish person, Fully liberates the wise.\" When the bodhisattva meditates on this, All these wrong things, Which imprison the confused, Sending them to the how ling hell, The same things liberate [the bodhisattva] Who attains bliss by the power of wisdom. By this reason, one enters into a delightful situation where there is a dis­tinctive incentive, a distinctive transformation, and a distinctive fruition, and one can achieve the goal of the fruition of the unexcelled great bliss-and not any other way. For the sake of that, by that very one, the pleasures of eating and living and so on cause the realization of omnis­cience that includes the eight masteries of excellent qualities and so on. The Magic Supreme Bliss [Tantra] also says: Therefore, by bliss there is bliss itself And all buddhas thus attain themselves. As for \"serve as conditions for addictions,\" the two new transla­tions of the Integrated Practices are correct to translate \"become the"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 523 cause for the horrid states.\" Concerning that, to the argument that \"rely­ing on the five objects, addictions are produced, and that again leads to the bad migrations,\" he answers that in regard to the addictions produced by relying on sense objects, they are analyzed into two, a cause of bad migrations for those who do not understand reality, such as the disciples, and a c ause of buddhahood for those who understand reality. He does not answer that relying on sense objects 12Htal will not produce addictions. In general as above explained, the person free from attachment to sense objects is not precluded from taking interest in getting desire ob­jects such as food and clothing. In regard to pleasant, unpleasant, and indiffe rent sense objects, they do not become addictive just by the five senses experiencing them or just by the mental sense's having an interest in sense objects. However, in this case, the main point is made in terms of not separating from passion for sense objects, and from among sense objects this is examining whether or not it is correct that one can take the passion for the union of the two sex organs as the path. If you are not free of passion for the desired, you do not have the realization of reality, and you still rely on sense objects as much as you want, you will feel the passionate addictions. Those [addictions] will also become the cause of your going to horrid migrations; thus the addictions will not at all be transformed into the cause even of liberation, and therefore they are not allowed. Neither does the individualist who does possess the understand­ing of reality have the ability to transform any addiction into a cause for enlightenment: since such a person does not have the art element of such a transformation which is taught in either the [exoteric] Transcendence or the secret Mantra Universal Vehicle; and since such transformation requires both the distinctive art and [distinctive] wisdom. Therefore, the statement that understanding the thatness of addictions serves as the cause of enlightenment shows that in such a case the addictions can become a cause of enlightenment (28lbl and does not show that for all those who understand thatness, the addictions that rely on sense objects become the cause of enlightenment; otherwise the many statements of the necessity of elements of art beyond the view of voidness would be meaningless. The reference quoted from the Glorious Supreme [Prime] shows that the three addictions can become either poisons or elixirs, which shows that the one-sided statements that the three addictions are only poisons to be eliminated are for the sake of a certain type of person and not for every­one. The previous reference from the Jewel Heap shows that some of the"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"524 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp addictions of bodhisattvas create the buddha qualities, which teaches that not all addictions obstruct the attainment of enlightenment. The second reference [from the Jewel Heap] shows that addictions combined with the distinctive art and wisdom cannot lead one into the wrong downfalls into the horrid migrations, showing that the same addictions that obstruct the higher rebirths for those not expert in [the distinctive] art cannot obstruct those who are so expert. As for the meaning of that Jewel Heap reference, it state s that just, while the Transcendence Vehicle bodhi­sattvas could eliminate craving for the addictions that cause rebirth in existence, when they purposefully leave them uneliminated, those addic­tions become a cause of buddhahood by driving them to take rebirth with the ability to complete the magnificent bodhisattva deeds. Elsewhere, there is the story about the addictive desire to commit sexual misconduct in the case of the distinctive embodiment of the brah­min boy \"Star,\" where the point is that if he did not pursue his desire [for a certain woman] it would have the preventable consequence of [her] death; and if he did pursue his desire he could uphold virtue [282al as he wished.150 This is completely different from such addiction becoming the cause of enlightenment and the system of making passion into the path in this [Tantric] path. Nevertheless, as this is a source for certain addictions combined with expertise in art becoming a cause of enlightenment, you can rebut the criticisms argued against [this path] that producing addictions from relying on sense objects must [inevitably] lead to horrid migrations, must become obstacles to enlightenment, and that various references are mutually contradictory. In the Dialog ue with the Householder Ugra, while the Buddha did recommend the deeds of the bodhisattva householder to one who could not eliminate the household desires, since there was no aspiration there to follow the path with the vehicle of passion, that [householder] was told to engage [in those deeds] with the idea of the dangers of relying on desires, which is different from the passionate discipline of the path of the unexcelled. The reference from the Yoga Tantra Glorious Supreme {Prime] is suitable for support here since, though it does not show that there is no fault [at all] in making passion into the path, [as it can be a 150 Have not yet been able to trace the s ource of this story about Bram ze • i khye 'u skar rna."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Chapter XI- Conduct Heightening Impact· 525 problem for an ordinary person,] it does show in general that it is possible in certain cases to take as a path the three addictions, relying on sense objects combined with expertise in the arts in order to increase one's spirit of enlightenment relying on the body of another and to increase the spirit of enlightenment of one's own body. Here you might wonder: \"Well it might be conceded that it can be permitted to use desire, but how can there be permission for hate and delusion?\" As for hatred, when you practice fierce activities such as killing or banishing, there is no anger at the time of the causing motivation, yet it is said that a rough mind is developed [282bJ on the occasion of the continu­ing motivation. In the context of the initial [creation stage performance] meditation of the defense wheel and so on, compassion is developed in the time of the causal motivation, but in the time of the continuing moti­vation it is explained that a hateful mind and so forth is developed toward the obstructive demons. So there is some allowance for hatred and its associated patterns. Further, since every passion or hatred occurs in coor­dination with addictive delusion, delusion is permitted as incidental to the permitting of other addictions, though it is not by itself permitted expressly. As for \"by what,\" it is the stupidity through passion for sense objects and specially passion for the union of the two sex organs; being a confusion about the meaning of thatness, it binds in the life cycle. By that very passion that leads to the hells such as the howling hell, the expert in art can become liberated in great bliss by the power of wisdom that realizes thatness. Thus, when you meditate the enlighten­ment spirit of bliss-void[ -indivisible], the artistically inept find a cause of bondage and the artistically expert become liberated. The Hevajra Ta ntra says: By passion the worldling is bound, But by passion one becomes liberated. Therefore there is cause both for bondage and for liberation in the same addiction of passion for sense objects. As the Vaj ra Rosary says: Abandoning duty and deviance, But performing the prohibited, Like the lotus unsullied by the mud. Understanding reality one is not infected."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"526 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Even though there is passion for the desire objects, one is \"not infected,\" that is not crushed by its faults; it is not that passion does not arise. Here you might wonder: \"Well, [283aJ if there is a way as that above in which other vehicles make addictions into a cause of enlightenment, and if the other types of Tantras make it into a path, making into a path just the passion of visualizing the five objects in the goddess who is meditated without [actual] union, then what about the way of making passion for sense objects the path in the Unexcelled [Tantras]?\" When your mind is attracted by intense faith from seeing clearly the exceptional excellence of the path that meditates on the decisively understood meaning of thatness by means of the intuition of the orgasmic bliss of melting, you then desire to develop the great bliss for the sake of meditating on thatness. That is to make a path out of the passion for the sense objects [involved in] uniting with the outer evolution consort or the [inner] intuition consort, as a means of developing that [great bliss]; and that is not only for that [purpose,] but is also in order to achieve the magic body. These I have already explained many times. As for making a path out of passion for desire objects for the sake of developing the distinctive subjectivity for meditating on voidness, it does not exist in any other vehicle than [that of] the Unexcelled [Yoga Tantras]. \"By this reason\" and so forth is translated by Patsab as \"By this way, [there is] a distinctive presumption, and,\" which conforms to the [related passage in] the Reality Accomplishment. The \"meaning\" is the creation of the deity as [desire-] object and support. \"Abiding\" is well [translated] as \"transfor ming.\" And all those [expressions] concisely express the path of the [advanced Tantric] conduct. By the art of penetrating the vital points in the outer and inner body, one melts the spirit of enlightenment and produces the distinctive textures of the body as inner object, and by that serving as an objective condition you create a distinctive bliss of sensation in the body con­sciousness. With that serving as the immediately preceding condition, (283hl the mental consciousness then develops a superlative experiential bliss. At that time, just by remembering the meaning of the reality of thatness that has been ascertained, bliss and void become united. That is declared to be the meditation on voidness by the art of creating the men­tality as the experience of bliss. Relying on that, the discerning person can understand the key point of this path as being the distinctive subjec­tivity that [focuses on the] nondifferent [object of] voidness."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Chapter XI- Conduct Heightening Impact· 527 As for that process of generating bliss in the sense consciousness and mental consciousness. it can be understood from the reasonings stated by the Lord of Reasoning [Dharmakirti, in his Tr eatise on Va lidat­ing Cognition]: And: When passions etc., expanding, increase, They are produced from pleasure and pain; And again, elements being equal, and so on, From approaching the inner object .... Because a mind arising from a special inner object, Can also be made to change it. Therefore, you should understand that the sense consciousnesses arise in the actuality of bliss from the immediately preceding condition of the mentality becoming the actuality of great bliss.1 5 1 [VI.B.3.c.i.B '2' -Rebutting others' objections to that] [Someone here might object,] \"Since the Integrated Practices states that \"disciples and so on, by being convinced about the object,\" and \"causing those who aspire to the magnificent to realize objective selflessness,\" doesn't it contradict the [Dialecticist Centrists' distinc­tively special] statement that the followers of the Individual Ve hicle can understand objective selflessness?\" Since among disciples there are both those who understand that­ness and those who do not, here mention of the \"convinced about the object\" disciple specifies which among them is being considered. As the Noble [Nagarjuna]'s statement was quoted [by Chandrak.Irti] in the Intro­duction [to the Central Way j Commentary: 151 Tsong Khapa seeks the backing of the great epistemologist Dharmakirti to show how a mind that is dominated by the inner object of subliminally enlightenment-spirit-grounded deep bliss perception becomes a bliss-subjectivity that can transmute any sense experience into bliss, whether ordinarily pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral; a compelling epistemology of sublimation."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"528 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp You said that without understanding signlessness, One will not attain liberation; Therefore you completely taught [284aJ That in the Universal Vehicle ... he was thinking that, although objective selflessness is explained in both canons, it is more extensively explained in the Universal Vehicle; thus he states that it is in the Universal Vehicle that one is caus ed to understand objective selflessness. Likewise, from the Disclosure of the Spirit of En­lightenment, [Nagarjuna] says: Those who desire to benefit, Explain to the disciples the five aggregates Of matter, sensation, conception, Vo lition, and consciousness. The supreme human always says That matter is like a ball of foam, Sensation like a water bubble, Conception like a mirage, Volition like a plantain tree, And consciousness like an illusion. Teaching the aggregates in such a way, He explains them to the bodhisattvas. Thus, he was intending that there are many explanations to the bodhi­sattvas of the intrinsic realitylessness of the aggregates by means of such examples, and not so many similar recitations in the Individual Vehicle canon. But, [he was] not [intending] that the Individual Vehicle follower was never taught the applicability of those five examples; since in the Introduction [to the Central Wa y] Commentary those five examples for the aggregates are stated, quoting from a Sotra taught to the disciples. If it was the interpretation of [Nagarjuna] that the Individual Vehicle lacks the understanding of voidness as intrinsic realitylessness, he would have been incorrect in stating in that same [Disclosure of the Sp irit of En­lightenment] text: Who do not understand voidness, They do not approach liberation,"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Chapter XI- Conduct Heightening Impact· 529 And those confused persons will wander In the prison of existence through the six migrations. -since fo llowers of the Individual Ve hicle 1211-'hl do have liberation from the prison of existence. Likewise, the Integrated Practices statement that by teaching those aspiring to the magnificent they are made to understand the eightfold aggregate of consciousness and so on, is merely referring to what was stated in the Sotras , since in [Aryadeva's] own system he does not accept a fu ndamental consciousness apart from the sixfold aggregate of consciousness. According to the Noble system of the Esoteric Com­munity, the mind of death clear light universal voidness is the death mind and the mind of imminence arising therefrom in the reverse order is the birth mind, neither of which is suitable as the fundamental consciousness. Though [Nagarjuna] mentions the mere name \"fundamental conscious­ness\" in the Disclosure of the Spirit of Enlightenment, it is only for the sake of declaring that the mental consciousness is the root and founda­tion of all purifying things, as I have already explained extensively in my Wi sdom Va jra Compendium Commentary. One may here object, \"By meditating on the import of thatness with the bliss from relying on the consort using passion for sense objects as a cause, are all addictions terminated or not? If it is the latter, then there is a contradiction between the realization of voidness progressing to the ex­treme ultimate and some addictions not being terminated. This is because, having terminated all truth habits, it is not appropriate that the termina­tion of the cause, the truth habits of misknowledge, would not eliminate the effect, passion and so forth; and because it is contradictory for libera­tion to be attained without terminating all addictions. If it is the former, [it is contradicted] since, as you need the passions as the cause of the path that terminates the passions, there is the absurd consequence that light serves as the cause of darkness; f2115aJ and it is contradictory for passion to serve as the cause of that path's radical elimination of the truth habit misknowledge. This is because is it contradictory for the cause of radical termination of a cause to be affected by the effect of that [cause]; and all other addictions are made to arise by the truth habit mis-knowledge.\" This I have already explained extensively elsewhere.152 152 Tsong Khapa has refuted this argument earlier in the context of self-consecration."},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"530 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Furthermore, you may wonder: \"The 'passion' concerned in the con­text of wishing to make passion into a path, if [on the one hand,] it is just a matter of attaching the name 'passion' to some other virtuous quality, it contradicts the Integrated Practices proof with evidence of something serving as basis of addiction either becoming or not becoming a cause of enlightenment, and it makes the statement that for some other person such a passion serves as the cause of going to bad migrations. A virtuous quality will not become the cause of bad migrations and will be the cause of enlightenment, so where is the excellent artistic skill distinctive from other vehicles? If [on the other hand,] it is real passion involved here, you would have to clearly pronounce how it becomes a path; [which you cannot do,] since you cannot express how a means of destruction elimi­nates its target from the perspective of being discordant in habit pattern, as for example, 'This becomes the remedy of this kind of addiction.' Therefore, the artistic skill of the Unexcelled Vehicle is no more than a mere object of [unfounded] faith!\" Here I should speak plainly. I do not accept the second alternative, but do accept the gist of the first. As for how the objection does no harm [to my position], the statement \"addictions are terminated by meditating the import of thatness by means of the bliss of r elying on the consort\" [285bl refers to the termination of misknowledge, the cause of all other addictions. Eliminating that means eliminating all addictions, but there is no fault [of contradiction,] since it does not eliminate that through a path which is manifestly contradictory in habit pattern to the passion which is attached to sense objects. The causal truth habit is not terminated until you attain the Ieamer's communion, so therefore there is no contradiction for a single continuum to alternate for a while the meditation of a path which is directly contradictory in habit pattern to the truth habit and the using as a path the attachment for sense objects [which is not contradic­tory in habit-pattern]. When you rely at will on a distinctive sense object without parting from attachment for sense objects, the two blisses, from passion for desire and from relying on a consort, are [related as] cause and effect; and as they are temporary cause and effect, if that attachment did not precede, such bliss [of contact with a consort] would be eliminated, though the mere bliss of relating to a consort would not be eliminated. For example, sweet myrobalan soaked in milk would not be produced without the milk, though the mere myrobalan would not be eliminated."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"Chapter XI- Conduct Heightening Impact· 53 1 Here, in tenninating addictions on this Unexcelled Ve hicle, I have already established that there is the enjoyment of sense objects through the union of two sex organs. As the Sampura Further Ta ntra says, in answer to the argument that you must eliminate passion by meditating offensiveness, which has its contradictory habit pattern: When you make use of the reality of passion, you separate from passion. Thus the Divine Lord says: \"Noble child! Emaho! The buddhas' passion is without turbidity; con­quering dispassion by means of passion, 1211tiaJ they grant the bestowal of all bliss.\" When the stream-winner experiences desire it does not become a natural transgression [for her or him]. When an incense-elephant eats the ketaka flower, the digested product becomes musk, while when an ordinary ele­phant eats the same flower its product becomes manure. Likewise, addic­tions such as passions, are explained to produce a distinctively excellent fruition from a distinctively pure continuum. Master Shantarak�hita also explained this point clearly in his Reality Accomplishment. Therefore, it is not a case of affixing the name \"passion\" to what is not real passion. Though one engages in making a path out of passion for desire ob­jects, at the time of the causal motivation, through one's intention being captivated by the spirit of enlightenment and the orgasmic intui-tion, one engages by perceiving [objects] for the sake of developing those [wis­doms] and one does not adulterate that [intention] with addictions. Since it not otherwise than that body and speech become virtuous and non­virtuous by the power of that [motivation being good or bad], when you engage in such activities with such an intention, acts such as self-creation are explained as happening without addictive intention; and this does not intend only the context of the time of motivation [but also the whole time of action]. When you make a path out of such a kind of passion, it does not dislodge other addictions by way of maintaining a contradictory habit pattern. Well then what [does it do]? One who has that distinctive embodiment makes it into a path with a view [first] to suppress the dangers of being led into the bad migrations by those passions and [second] to cause the swift development of the excellences of the superior 1211tibJ path."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"532 ·Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp In regard to the first, such [practitioners] have become suitable vessels by the power of the stability and purity of the twofold spirit of enlightenment of the ordinary vehicle. They then defend properly the vows and pledges. They inquire into the decisive meaning of the view of selflessness, thereby confirming their vision of the magical [nature of reality]. They create the deity body as the universal seal from within the experiential nonperception of the three sectors of object and support. They thereby develop the potency of aspiration blessed by mantra and seal. [Such practitioners] have many [accomplishments], such as restrain­ing the tenfold nonvirtuous actions with regard to objects, purifying their continua by means of initiation, guarding properly their vows and pledges, cultivating the samadhi of the first stage, and being expert in the science of the control of passion. In regard to the second, it is not enough to consider a meditation on voidness to be merely a thought-free stabilization of the mind that produces bliss derived from such passion. Rather, enlightenment is quickly bestowed by meditating on orgasmic wisdom intuition realized by placing the mind on the great bliss, above and beyond the view that is superlatively decisive about the import of selflessness. Further in that regard, it is not sufficient that the enlightenment spirit melted by the condition of the consort be made by other means not to emit; rather [it is required] that-since the orgasmic [great bliss] can only arise from such union causing the wind-energies of [right] rasanii and [left] lalanii channels first to be injected into the dhati channel and then to dissolve there, as the art of orgasmic bliss- it is necessary for the wind-energies to dissolve [into the dhati channel] and hold the melted jasmine-like spirit of enlightenment. In making such a sort of passion into the path, though there is no offensiveness meditation, (287aJ a habit pattern diamet­rically opposite to that of passion, finally passion is terminated [anyway]; because [this orgasmic intuition] is a path that corresponds with a vali­dating knowledge of a habit pattern diametrically opposite to that of the root cause of [such passion, namely the deluded truth-habit]. 153 153 The idea here seems to be that, in order to in ject the life-energy and evacuative wind­energy into the central dhati channel, one has to unravel the sixfold heart knot, which can only be done by deep (meaning reaching to the instincts and their physical correlates in (cont'd)"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Chapter XI- Conduct Heightening Impact· 533 Without uniting with the void that is known as the voidness of the intrinsic reality of all of the samsaric life cycle and of nirvana, achieving the bliss of mere non-emission of the enlightenment spirit produced by the joining of the two sex organs does not at all damage the truth habit of misknowledge, the root of existence. Thus, however much you engage with such bliss, the craving derived from that truth habit only becomes more increased, just like a thirsty person plunging into the perceived water of a mirage, such a thing is inferior. However, in the case of being able to unite the bliss and void as previously explained, without such an art [of re straining emission by injecting the energies into the central channel], one will not quickly attain the buddhahood that fu lfills the hopes of the beings of the three realms.

Knowing thatness by thatness Who relies on a goddess, He will achieve; and otherwise, He will fall into [287bJ the great hell! the subtle nervous system) realization of the selflessness or intrinsic truthlessness of all things, which has a cognitive habit-pattern diametrically opposed to the truth habits."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"534 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Also from the Esoteric Accomplishment: Even with thatness as the pure jewel self, One who has abandoned all faults­Should that one abandon the divine art, Contradict one's commitments and so on, And come to practice in some other ways; That one will roast in hell and so on.

Likewise lacking [the wisdom of] thatness Even making a few great seeming wonders, Until one can dwell [aloft] in space, After one's death, one will go to hell. Thus the wise should engage [in the Tantric conduct,] having well investigated things in fine detail. If you have not become wise by deter­mining well the import of thatness and abandoning all elaborations, there are stated to be extremely heavy dangers in taking the general and dis­tinctive passion for sense objects as your path.

[VI.B.3.c.ii.-Specific explanation of the Unexcelled (Yoga Tantric) conduct] Second, the specific explanation of the Unexcelled [Yoga Tantric] conduct, has three parts: [A'] How the analysis of conduct is declared; [B'] The definition of each of the three conducts; and [C'] The method of learning the conducts. [VI.B.3.c.ii.A'-How the analysis of conduct is declared] In the context of the titles of the Root Ta ntra's chapters five and seven, re spectively \"Supreme All-Around Conduct\" and \"Supreme Man­tric Conduct,\" 154 [Chandrakirti,] in the Illumination of the Lamp, explains the meanings as, [respectively,] the superlative conduct achieving all the aims of self and other and the three conducts of the mantric reciter. The former is a general name of all three [Tantric] conducts. [21111bl As [Chan­drakirti] says in the Illumination of the Lamp about the meaning of statements in the [Root Ta ntra} Ninth Chapter about the two conducts, [those of] of bodhisattvas and of transcendent buddhas, the first is the mantri/ni engaging to the best of one's ability in whatever will fu lfill the aims of beings, whether or not it contravenes mundane conventions, and the second is the jewel-like mantri/ni realizing the perfection stage and transforming one's own actual ity in this very life by the engaged conduct 154 Samantacaryagra, and Mantracaryagra chapters, re spectively."},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"536 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp that is not withdrawn in meditative equipoise. The former is the general conduct of bodhisattvas, and the latter mentions the perfection stage by way of example only, intending chiefly the jewel-like person, but includes all the distinctive unexcelled conducts of engaging with the objects of desire. As [Chandrakirti] says in Illumination of the Lamp about the mean­ing of statements in the Sixteenth Chapter about truly undertaking the discipline of the science consort, they refer to engaging in activities having transformed oneself and the science consort into the likeness of deities dressed with the appropriate clothing. As far as the supreme three conducts mentioned in the commentary on the Sixth Chapter, though the two old translations and Patsab's transla­tion all take these as referring to enjoyment conducts and liberating conducts, Chag's translation is better in its \"the supreme of these conducts is the conduct of eating, sleeping, and defecating [bhusuku]\" as [this pas­sage] does not indicate other conducts. In the Further Ta ntra, when it mentions the \"all-around conduct\" and the \"mantri/ni conduct,\" [it uses] the former as the general name for the three conducts and the latter for the Seventeenth Chapter's mention of maintaining the mundane and tran­scendental [289aJ commitments and vows. [Aryadeva] in his Integrated Practices, states the division of the passion-developed bodhisattva's conduct into the three, elaborated, un­elaborated, and extremely unelaborated, and the Second Stage and the Illumination of the Lamp also mention the three. As for the chief desire object of the conducts, it is the desire object of the science consort, among whom there are actual sciences and sciences who are contemplative wisdom-seals. [Aryadeva] argues that the first of those is engaged with in the first two conducts and the latter is engaged with in the third conduct. The mention in the In tegrated Practices and in the Second Stage of the three conducts of the perfection stage practitioner is just by way of example, since each of the two stages has its own set of three conducts. As [Chandrakirti] says in the Illumination of the Lamp tenth chapter: When the yogi/ni, while achieving the supreme and abid­ing in the ordinary, when, after experiencing her or his practice of the three conducts, the elaborated conduct and so forth, s/he does not reach any accomplishments, then s/he must compel the essence of her or his deity."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Chapter Xi-Conduct Heightening Impact · 537 Thereby he states that the conducts of the two stages are undertaken in order to achieve accomplishments according to one's situation, and that if one does not achieve them one should compel the essence [of one's deity] particular to whichever of the two stages. In comment on the Seventh Chapter, when [ChandrakTrti] equates the elaborated [conduct] with general meaning, the unelaborated with hidden meaning, and the extremely unelaborated with ultimate meaning, he intends the meditation and aspiration of engaging in the conducts, and he is not arguing that general meaning conduct did not include the other conducts; 1289hl since he mentions in comment on the [Root Ta ntra] Fifteenth Chapter the un­elaborated conduct of the five transcendent buddhas of the creation stage, and since, though the extremely unelaborated [conduct] is not assigned to the creation stage practitioner in terms of its meditation and aspiration, it is assigned [to them] in terms of activities and so on. In general, there are two kinds of conducts of those who make passion for desire objects into the path, conducts at the time of empower­ment making one a suitable vessel for meditating the two stages and conduct at the time of meditating the path, already having become a suit­able vessel. In the latter case there are again two [conducts], conducts to produce the path when it has not been produced, and conducts, having already produced the path, in order to intensify the impact. The fo rmer of these occurs from the beginning of first meditating the path for as long as one has not attained the non-learning state. As is stated in the Condensed [Sadhana], you should practice in such a way once you enter the creation stage: Not suffering from the ascetic abandoning Of the five desire objects, Following the Yoga Tantra You should achieve enlightenment through bliss. Regarding the second [kind of conducts, those focused to intensify the impact], Kr�hl).a Samayavajra states that one engages in conducts only at two times, since there are only two occasions of intensifying the impact [of realization]; intensifying impact to achieve ordinary accom­plishments, after you have completed the subtle and coarse creation stages, and intensifying impact to achieve the supreme accomplishment, once you have achieved the perfection stage with the three isolations and the two realities."},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"538 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Tsunmojen, relying on statements such as \"knowing the different types of instinctual natures and luminances,\" also says there are three occasions in general [290a 1 for performing the conducts, and two on the perfection stage, after you attain the magic body and after you attain the learner's union. My own interpretation is that there are four occasions of intensi­fying impact on both the stages, as follows. First, on the occasion of the creation stage, it is as above [in the theory of Kr�hQa Samayavajra]. [Second,] I have already established the need to engage in the conducts in order to achieve the magic body, having attained the mind isolation on the perfection stage. [Third,] having attained the magic body, you must practice the conducts in order to attain the goal of the learner's union and in order to terminate the abandonable addictions. As [Chandrakirti states] in comment on the Sixteenth Chapter's statement of the benefits of engag­ing in the unelaborated conducts of the three clans: The intuitive wisdom of the three vajras arises ... [ Chandrakirti comments:] There is the creation here of the vajra body and so forth by means of the body vajra [OM] and so forth. The buddha enlightenment is the ultimate reality. To enter there is to attain. Clear light transparence causes the attainment of the pure intuition body. Thus [in this context] he explains the benefits of causing the attainment of the intuition body purified by clear light, since there is no [need for] purify­ing of the magic body by clear light after you have attained communion. [Fourth,] as for engaging in the conducts having attained the learner's communion, you can understand it from the previous quotes from the Five Stages and Nagabodhi's [Stage of Arrangement]. You can also under­stand it from what [Aryadeva] explains in the Integrated Practices about the practitioner engaged in the conducts realizing the superficial reality; that being connected to the two embodiments of the superficial magic body of the third and the fifth stages. Furthermore, [Aryadeva] states in the Integrated Practices: You cannot [290bJ terminate the instincts of beginningless addictions without the conducts of the discipline."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Chapter XI- Conduct Heightening Impact· 539 Therefore, all the cognitive obscurations which are the actuality of the addictive instincts cannot be terminated without the disciplinary conducts, so you cannot terminate them in this life without those conducts. Since the very swift termination of those seeds of addictions called instincts depends on that, you can understand why you need to practice the con­ducts for the sake of the learner's and non-learner' s communions. If you wonder here, \"if you are making desire for sense objects into the path from the time of taking empowerment, the chief three con­ducts are no more than just that; although you can engage in conducts outside of that [overall] situation, what is the need?\" The conducts needed to intensify impact on the perfection stage are for attaining enlightenment in this life. As the [Five Stages'} Second Stage says: Knowing to distinguish luminance from the instincts, One re lies on the fourth thatness -Who does not learn the three forms [of the conducts] Will not swiftly attain the fruit. Just as the fire abides in the womb of wood, But does not emerge without rubbing, So without the practice of enlightenment, It will not emerge here in this very life. Also, the Integrated Practices and the Illumination of the Lamp explain that the supreme is achieved in this very life by engaging in the conducts. As for the way that is, when you can produce the three intuitions by the power of consummating the wind-energy yoga, you cannot produce the completely qualified mind-isolation intuition without the friendship of the outer seal [consort]. Relying on her for that purpose has already been explained. Thus, even though you can withdraw the energies by the power of penetrating the vital point within the body and, burning the inner fire, consummate the ability to melt [29lal the enlightenment spirit, still beyond that to attain the greatly distinctive form of those by re lying on the seal, it is clear that there is a stage of proceeding to the intensive development of the re alization of thatness. Therefore, when you have completed your ability in the art of penetrating the vital point within the body, combining it with enjoyment with all components the desire object"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"540 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp of the seal, and then meditating on thatness-that is the meaning of \"the conduct,\" the conduct that intensifies the impact of the perfection stage. While not developing the special bliss from penetrating the vital points in the inner wheels, from the specifics of the actuality, enumera­tion, distinction of access, and intensity of power of the seal, a variety of distinct types of bliss is produced. So, you should understand that at that time there are many ways of progressing to entry of the special re aliza­tion from meditating on voidness with that [bliss]. If you wonder, \"Well, if the common accomplishments are not attained without engaging in those conducts, that contradicts the explana­tion that the path taught in those Tantras enables the attainment of the whole range of common accomplishments from practicing the three lower Tantras; and even if you allow that those common accomplishments are there anyway by implication, what is the benefit in achieving them by engaging in those conducts?\" Though you do not need to meditate on voidness to achieve many trivial common accomplishments, it is explained that you do need to meditate on voidness to achieve many distinctive accomplishments that accrue in the lower Tantras. And while some say that it is indispensable for such achievement, others say that it is easier to achieve them if that realization is there. Among the Unexcelled [Tantra] creation [29tbJ stage yogi/nis attainments of common accomplishments, there are many not achieved by the former [lower Tantras]. One does engage in the conducts as a method of achieving the ultimate among common accomplishments, and easily achieving them in a very short time, as stated in many other [texts] how \"by the three [conducts], accomplishments will be achieved before seven days, a fortnight, a month, or two and a half.\" When the creation stage is consummated and the signs of touch and sight are found, by meditating on the PHAT letter in the door of the secret place and so forth, one can block the emission of the enlightenment spirit, and so uniting with the seal, generate bliss. Meditating on voidness with that bliss, distinctive accomplishment is created, and it is easy to achieve accomplishments. I already explained how just by that there is the medi­tation of bliss-void also in the creation stage. If some person completes the subtle creation stage, it is also pos­sible that the wind-energies will be injected into the central channel; and if that person knows the vital point of using the union with the outer con­sort as life-energy control, relying on that [practice], it is possible that"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact · 541 s/he can generate the fo ur joys from dissolving the energies into the dhati. Those two achievements thus may arise in the creation stage, but when one defines the path, they must be taken as the perfection stage path� as it is explained in the Persona/Instruction, [even] before meditating the path, on the occasion of initiation, the orgasmic [wisdom] thus arising is of the perfection stage. This engaging in the conducts for the sake of common accomplishments on the occasion of the creation stage is not [the affair] of the supreme jewel-like person, but is that of the white-lotus-like person of inferior faculties, I2CJ2u[ whose mind is attracted by the common accomplishments. l VI.B.3.c.ii.B' -The definition of each of the three conducts] When the three kinds of passionate enlightenment conducts are de­clared, which Tantras are their source and what is the definition of each? The Integrated Practices explains that the elaborated conduct is in the Extensive All Transcendent Buddha Arali, as taught in the Consola­tions of the Transcendent Buddha and Vajradhara ; the unelaborated is playing somewhat on the power of intention from the Always Pervading; and the extremely unelaborated conduct is the practicing by abandoning all crowds, living on the food of samadhi alone, and uniting contempla­tively with the intuition seal. Just as the three, wood, palm leaves, and cotton are not different when burned to ashes, so all three of the conducts will lead to attaining the exaltation of Vajradhara, even though by differ­entiation into small, medium, and great, you must learn the three conducts [and apply them appropriately like medicines] according to your age. In that regard, the statement from the [Buddha] Union that the five clans tame beings with the fi ve consolations is the fi rst consolation; and the second consolation is the consolation that tames beings by means of Vajrasattva. Depending on this, the ancient [mentors] claimed that in the context of [one's being engaged] in the procedures of the conducts, chiefly there will be no more than six death-transitions. As it is taught, though in the context of the six consolations the [conduct as taught in the] E:tten­sive Arali is absent, in general they have the meaning explained in the [Buddha] Union; \"arali\" having the meaning of \"game\" or [2CJ:!b[ \"play.\" And that refers to what is spoken of in the Integrated Practices as the seal and re sponding to it, and so on. Some practitioners strive in the practices stated from the Tantras such as Reality Compendium, with the gestures,"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"542 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp the worship with song, the way of postures, theatre, and dance and so on. Others engage in the conducts- stated in Tantras such as the Glorious Supreme [Prime]-such as the cross-legged sitting posture and the nine aesthetic moods of dance and so on; and all of these are explained by the Integrated Practices as [pertaining to] the elaborated conducts. Therefore, as for the unelaborated conducts, in general one must always perform those conducts, and sometimes when necessary one can leave them. However, in this concern, there still are many elaborations such as a special house along with seats, friends to perform the rites, and the Dharma equipment, and food and drink and so on. Nevertheless, as the practices are classified as extremely unelaborated, the elaborations in the activities are very little. By three examples it is shown that the goal can be attained by each of the three conducts, showing that it is not nec­essary to practice all three. The former among the three, wood etc. are the harder to burn, the latter easier, which explains that by the three kinds of conduct there is a range from difficult to easier. As for \"small, medium, and great,\" some say it refers to bigger, medium, and smaller equipment, and some explain it is small, medium, and great wisdom, and others explain it as great, medium, and small passion. However, it is mentioned in terms of bigger, medium, and smaller equipment, small, medium, and great age, and small, medium, and great inclination [293aJ that enjoys elabo­rations. As for not having plenty of equipment, this is not the context of having attained the magic body, so it is terms of engaging in the conducts prior to that. As for the first of those conducts, it is explained in the [Buddha] Union, while the Community mentions only the last two, according to the explanation of the Integrated Practices. As for the seal and so on taught in the Yoga Tantras, s/he is [employed] for engaging in the unexcelled conduct; if you analyze it, this intends the first conduct, and is not in terms of those [Unexcelled Yoga] Tantras. Intending that the extensive elaborations of activities previously mentioned are not stated in the Com­munity, [the above] states that the last two conducts only are taught in the Community. As for the Illumination of the Lamp mention that the Com­munity text teaches the first conduct, it is not contradictory since it is [referring to] the teaching of behaving according to your desire while engaged in elaborations and the mere intention and contemplation of engaging in elaborated conducts by the creation stage practitioner."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 543 In the Integrated Practices, [Aryadeva] explains that, if you could never perfonn the elaborated conducts described in the {Buddha/ Union, due to insufficiency of wealth , [then,] concerning the explanation to per­fonn the two latter conducts according to that Tantra's statement: Each day, or each month, Or likewise, each year, While being richly blessed, Perform the dance of Buddha Super Bliss! -this teaches the two latter [types of] the conduct, performed in the two later times [mentioned]. As Chag's translation phrases it \"While by your achievement itself,\" explaining that you should perfonn [the conducts] as your wealth allows, [29.�bl which intends that this teaches the two latter conducts. One should not interpret the two latter conducts of this text [as being the same as] the two conducts of the Community. In this {Buddha Union] text, the [Teacher] asserts that the fo rmer conducts being set down as three are in fact two, from the perspective of the intentions involved; the intention of engaging in desire and the intention of learning the embodiment. The first of these is the threefold engagement by a person with intense thirst and lust, with the intention of the conduct with what­ever desirable objects are desired, while experiencing only through the organs, through the organs and samadhi both, and only through samadhi; [these three] explained respectively as the intentions to engage in the three [conducts], elaborated, unelaborated, and extremely unelaborated. As the Root Ta ntra Se venth Chapter declares: And: In regard to all enjoyment of desires, Resorting to them at your pleasure, By that sort of union [practice], You will quickly attain buddhahood. All enjoyment of desires, You should resort to them at pleasure, By the union of your own deity, You should worship self and other. Do not recite while eating al msfood, Do not take pleasure in begging-"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"544 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Enjoying all desires, Recite not losing the elements of mantra. The first of these verses means that the yogi/or should practice as s/he pleases according to his or her faculties, engaging in elaborated conducts. The second means that in terms of the unelaborated, one should satisfy by worshiping self and other by the samadhi of one's own nature with the five sense objects for tasting bliss as one desires. The third means [294a] that, with the \"eating of almsfood\" as an example, not to recite [mantra] by engaging in seeking and so forth like someone going begging. Not only should you not be attached to begging but your body should abide without craving even food, which is the way to engage in the extremely unelaborated conducts. This is asserted in accordance with the explanation in the Illumination of the Lamp. Relying on the statement in the former case \"to engage in accordance with one's faculties,\" it is inter­preted as revealing the three intentions with which one engages in the conducts. Here the main thing is to engage with sense objects aiming for the purpose of the nondual, communion, great bliss wisdom, as is explained above as similar for all three conducts. You can understand by what the Root Ta ntra says: The passionate one who desires intuitive wisdom Always resorts to the [five] objects of desire ... -that this is not engaging only for the sake of the organs. Engaging in sense objects thus becomes the art of freshly producing enlightenment spirit where there was none before, maintaining [the already produced] without loss, and maximizing it even more, this is enjoying ceaselessly as one pleases according to one's inclinations and desires; and this is the same for all three conducts. So the two [verses' two] lines that begin with \"desire\" and the third that begins with \"enjoying all desires\" are similarly stated. Thus in order for those teachings not to be redundant, it is said that they teach the three conducts. The passage, from \"begging and so forth . .. ,\" rejects the obstacle to meditating the path 1294hl caused by dis­traction from activities of seeking and getting, due to excessive craving for food. It is not rejecting always practicing from the point of view of understanding the nature of desire objects, so the statement that \"you should be content just by keeping the body maintained\" means you should"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 545 maintain the body without harming the increase of its elements, and does not just mean keeping one's life sustained. That such a way is not a dis­tinctive characteristic of the third conduct can be known from the section in the Sixteenth Chapter where you depend on the food of the unelabo­rated. As for not interpreting this to refer to merely sustaining your life, you can know that by analyzing the necessity in general , that you should always rely on desire objects. As for the intention to learn the embodiment, while the fo rmer [conducts done with the intention of engaging in desires] keep the senses fo cused on the sense objects, here [the three are] the learning of the deity in the context of the first conduct, the learning in the context of mere mind in the second [conduct], and the intention of meditating on void­ness in the third [conduct]. Here the Illumination of the Lamp Seventh Chapter explains that the general, hidden, and ultimate meanings of the enjoyment of sense objects apply to [the occasions of] the three conducts. In the context of the path, [Chandrak.Irti] interprets [the enjoyment of desires in the three conducts] as respectively referring to [first,] the stages from single-mindedness up to the beginner' s achievement, [second,] the stages from body isolation up to the magic [body], and third, the stages of clear light and communion. By learning the elaborated conduct, while meditating the desire objects as divine with the intention to medi­tate engaging with desire objects, you meditate the fi ve objects from form to texture as from Vairochana to Ak�hobhya and offer [each] to [its] own clan deity. And while each object has inferior, mediocre, [29SaJ and superior [qualities], they are the same when meditated as divine, so still you worship with the fi ve supreme [sense objects]. Otherwise, Chandra­kirti states in the Illumination of the Lamp that the goddesses such as Lochana, or the meditating on the five Vajra [sense object goddesses, Ropavajra, etc.], should be enjoyed while seeing all of them as the enjoy­ments of Vajradhara. Thus, as for the statement of the three ways, in answer to the question, \"through desire for passionate wisdom, what are you going to do by that reliance on sense objects in all paths of the con­ducts?\" it is stated: \"Please the bodhisattva! Desire the sun of enlightenment!\" The Illumination of the Lamp says that this means that, having pleased the bodhisattva of the eye and other sense organs you should satisfy the"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"546 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp (female] \"bodhisattvas,\" [the goddesses] of the four elements and the sun, the (buddhas of the] five aggregates; so it is for the purpose of expanding one's senses, elements, and five aggregates. As for offering to one's own clan deity, it is to take Vairochana and so on as the chief, and is not just that alone. It teaches that you should wo rship with the supreme objects, intending that, as to the aspect of whatever object meditated as divine, when you directly enjoy it, your sense organ with its support will expand if it is attractive, and will not expand if it is otherwise [unpleasant], so you should worship [both kinds] with the supreme [qualities in mind]. When you meditate the five objects as the four goddesses Lochana and so on, you identify Mamaki as both in the vajra and jewel clans, so you meditate her as both sound and texture. Though the three [conducts] are thus explained, the chief sense ob­ject is the sense object of the wisdom [consort], so you should meditate the latter two [sense objects, taste and texture,] as chief. As for the way of [295bl putting this into practice, the Seventh Chapter [of the Commu­nity] states: Constantly unite your mind To form, sound, taste and so on; This concentrates the secret essence Of all the buddhas. And the Illumination of the Lamp explains that you should always day and night develop the mental orientation toward meditating objects as divine and this is the usually hidden art that is the means of attaining the exalted state of buddhahood, hence the \"concentrated essence.\" Thus, in meditating the five objects as deities, by meditating continuously, specifi­cally making [yourself] see forms and so on as deities, you must first pro­duce a stable experience [of those objects as deities]. Furthermore, you visualize that the Ropavajra goddess, emerging from the transformation of all the inner and outer material sense-media, holds in her lotus soft hand a mirror which she beholds with a calm eye, and her pearl necklace pendant hangs on her swelling breast, her blouse slightly loosened to reveal her beautiful torso- so from looking steadily at her form, you contemplate the arisal of great bliss. Likewise sounds are created as Shabdavajra, singing sweet songs and playing on the lute; scents are created as Gandhavajra, dancing and holding a jeweled vessel filled with scents such as saffron, eaglewood, snake-essence sandalwood,"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact · 547 and camphor, pervading everything with excellent scents; tastes are created as Rasavajra, holding precious vessels of gold and silver fi lled with various tastes and divine elixirs; and J:!9tiaJ textures are created as Sparshavajra, adorned with all signs, with the three [brow-]creases of fierce intensity, with a slender waist and wide navel curling clockwise, with exquisite lower torso and pelvis, her movements slow and graceful, her face completely smiling and gazing [at you] with passionate eyes. In this way you contemplate the expansion of great bliss by enjoying fo rms, sounds, scents, and tastes and engaging with textures through mutual embrace. Those ways of meditating can also be employed with Lochana and so on, and you should analyze whether you must meditate [her] as like Vairochana, very beautiful in form and the three middle [buddha goddesses] as having hand signs as above, and whether the fifth [buddha goddess] holds textures of superior clothes. One would think that for each of them one should meditate the different members of the clan in common. When one practices like that, first of all, bliss is produced in the mind, and then gradually, indirectly, the body endowed with the sup­ported sense-faculty expands; since the Lord of Reasoning [DharmakTrti] said: When this transforms, those also Are experienced as transforming -that is, when the mind becomes extremely blissfu l, the body also is seen to gain a good glow, and so samadhi becomes the cause of expansion that expands the body's elements. Such being the case, the jasmine-like en­lightenment spirit increases, and the melting bliss samadhi increases, and by meditating voidness with it the supreme realizations of the perfection stage are completely produced, and their root of virtue is developed. Once such samadhi becomes stable, [29(,bJ when the senses directly enjoy the five sense objects, you realize the samadhi previously meditated, and by restraining the attitude of ordinariness which is the counteragent of great bliss-that is said to be the supreme discipline of the system of this path that binds the door of the senses. This is the intention of meditating the conduct with the sense ob­jects, from the beginning of meditating the path for as long as one cannot develop the voids by dissolving the energies into the dhati by the power of meditating the penetration of the vital points of the body. Further,"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"548 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp when you unite bliss and void by dissolving the energies into the dhati by the power of such meditation, as long as you cannot eclipse the sign habit elaborations, it is called \"the intention of the elaborated [conduct].\" Though the creation stage practitioner lacks the two latter conducts from the point of view of meditation and intention, they have all three types of conducts from the point of view of the measure of elaborations concern­ing objects and activities. This instruction must be implemented from the beginning of the creation stage, as it is extremely important for the beginner. From the time when you can develop the voids as the energies dissolve by the power of meditation, for as long as you have not attained the fourth stage clear light, you develop the previously trance-induced voids, and in the aftermath context, you create yourself as Vajradhara and you seal with the three voids both conducts engaged with sense objects, and you enjoy them in the mode of offering them to Vajradhara. In comparison with the former, your elaborations of signs are slight, but you have not directly realized thatness, so your meditational intention is to learn the unelabo­rated conduct. Furthermore, from the point of view of meditation and intention, [297a] while you have neither the elaborated nor the extremely unelaborated conducts, you do have all three conducts from the point of view of ritual activities and so forth. From the time of attaining the learner's communion, for as long as you have not attained the nonleamer's communion, in the aftermath occa­sion, you seal your engagement with sense objects with the development of the direct realization of thatness, and you are liberated from the seeds of truth insistence and sign habit elaborations, and so have the meditation and intention of the extremely unelaborated conduct.

As for the change of costumes of the yogis and yoginis, according to the explana­tion of the [Buddha] Union and as explained in the [Community] Six­teenth Chapter: Of the body, speech, and mind vajras, Meditating the body, speech, and mind, Do that by one's own natural way ­Thus you will attain accomplishments. -and in commentary on that: \"One's [own natural] way ... \" is doing it by the very change of costume, not just [298al by meditating. Thus the yogi/nis of three vajras when they performs the discipline of the science [consort], this is explained for them and their consort seal. As for the substance of the mask, the Great Translator's and Patsab's version of the In tegrated Practices and the separate translation of the [Buddha] Union state \"the nature of the element and life and arisen from a root,\" about the latter of which, Chag's translation \"a living being, [and] arisen from a root\" is better. This means you should make the mask out of precious elements such as gold or silver, or human bone and so on animal products, or from the root of a tree and so on. The Illumination of the Lamp explains that you should make it out of wood etc. As for the form of craftsmanship, it can either be poured in a mold, carved in relief, manu­factured by beating, or painted. You should make it according to the deity as far as faces and arms, etc., color, and symbolic implements. As the old translation of the Integrated Practices and the Chag translation say: Surround it with the seal, Who practices oriented toward one's deity -they explain that you do not need the seal who serves as the science [consort] of this [deity]. Nevertheless, as Patsab['s translation] says:"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 551 The masks of one's deity Do bring forth the seal of accomplishment -so the masks of one's deity do occasion the accomplishment which is the costumed seal. which is the meaning of \"surround.\" Also the separate translation of the {Buddha] Union: You should perform with the seal of achievement In the costume of your deity. [298hl The Integrated Practices old translation says: Poured or carved, Manufactured or painted, Images of various forms, Thus conceive the marked seal. The \"marked seal\" here is not explained as \"masked,\" since it is clearly expained in the Tantra to be the marked seal's symbolic implement. Thus, Patsab's translation [separating images and marked seal with] \"images of various forms and ... \" is preferable. The Integrated Practices old translation says: Instructing well the consorts,155 Endowed with your own deity, The fortunate one is marked by his/her own seal . Thus conceive the group mandala. The meaning of the first phrase is like what is stated in the separate trans­lation of the Tantra, \"similar to your own deity.\" As for how it is similar, you should understand it according to Patsab's translation: By the masks of your own deity Practice well with the consorts. 155 Though the word is bud med rnams, \"women,\" I transite \"consorts,\" to mke this appli­cable as instruction for a yogini as well as a yogi, which the tradition maintains as theoreti­cally possible if practically only rarely done.

Here, as for the statement that the yogi/ni who attains the supreme performs the wondrous deeds of punishing and upholding in that very group mandala from the door of the six clans, it is mostly [referring to] the time after attaining the learner's communion; and those deeds are stated in the [Buddha] Union."},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 555 Thus, at the end of cultivating the creation of the orgasmic [wisdom­intuition] by relying on the consort seal, (30tnl arising from that, the lord who is the actuality of great bliss, in order to teach strongly the great arali play, which quickly gives rise to the Dharma of fu lfilling the aims of self and other, there is the stage of performing the dance of the buddha-music.

[VI.B.3.c.ii.c'l 'b'ii' -The unelaborated ritesj The Integrated Practices teaches three ways of the unelaborated conduct; if you cannot completely make the condensed mandala for the unelaborated conduct due to insufficient wealth, you should perform the unelaborated conduct with the fi ve thatnesses together with the five seal consorts; or, if you do not have that, you should perform the unelaborated"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"556 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp conduct together with a single consort. Or, if you have sufficient wealth you should perform the unelaborated conduct having completely created the condensed mandala. Then, if you cannot create the condensed man­dala completely, it is a question of having or not having all the equipment such as costumes and so on for the yogis and yoginis equal in number to the deities, it is not a matter of performing or not performing the medi­tative rites in the complete mandala. Since the Illumination of the Lamp Fifteenth Chapter states, in the context when the Ak�hobhya yogi/ni per­forms the unelaborated conduct together with his/her seal consort, that the deities of the mandala meditated as the Ak�hobhya mandala should adorn the mandala, the meditation of the full deities of the mandala is the same in all three forms of the unelaborated conduct. Thus, in the water-color drawn mandala, the arrangement of the thirty-one variegated lotus seats covered with cloths as the deities' places and the [302aJ twenty-three yogis and nine yoginis arrayed with the deity costumes is the expansive unelaborated. As for the medium unelaborated, the conduct of the thatness of the five secrets, the Illumination of the Lamp Root Commentary Fifteenth Chapter states that you should place day and night the practitioner meditated as Vajradhara on the central seat and four consorts well learned in Mantra and Tantra visualized as the actualities of the four goddesses Lochana etc. on the seats of Lochana etc. [On the other hand,] the Integrated Practices states that four consorts with the forms of the four goddesses Rupavajra etc. should be placed in the four quarters, and one consort with the form of Sparshavajra should abide upon your lap. If you only have five consorts, then it is obvious you have to choose between those two [options]. The Sixteenth Chapter [Illumination of the Lamp]'s explanation that the three clan yogi/nis should practice with Lochana, Mamaki, and Pandaravasini is cited by the Integrated Practices as a source for the unelaborated conduct with a single consort. Thus, it is not definite that the lord's consort seal should be created as only Sparshavajra, which should also be understood with regard to the other two [forms of the] unelaborated conduct. Therefore, if you perform the medium unelaborated, you should place five variegated lotuses covered with cloths in the center of the mandala and in the inner four comers; or, you should place the five seats and six costumes on the second row four corners [and in the center]. If you perform the con­densed unelaborated, you should use two seats and two costumes."},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"Chapter Xi-Conduct Heightening Impact· 557 Then, as for the actual stages of the rite, the Integrated Practices states:158 There create the measureless mansion with the vajra jewel pinnacle, purify the outer seal consort, f.\\02hl and you should practice the great seal [embrace] together with the disciple included within one clan. The process of that is, fi rst only, understanding ultimate re ality, then arising by the process of self-consecration, emitting and then internalizing Ak�hobhya, you abide as the very lord and master of the mandala. As for the way of creating the retinue, Patsab's translation of the Inte­grated Practices is clear: Then, having visualized the deities of the mandala such as Vairochana, the retinue unwaveringly free of any notions of ordinariness who serve as members of your own body mandala, you should propitiate the whole mandala circle.

The position of Master Go is that [right] from the defense wheel [visualization] you should completely meditate the prime union, claiming that to be the position of Tsunmojen and Trinshugjen, I 59 and the creation stage practitioner should follow the evocation by using the three rite creation and so on, [303aJ while the perfection stage practitioner should use the instantaneous creation. There are also explanations in other treatises that you should use instantaneous creation in the self­creation context, once you have completed the creation stage. In regard to the tendency of the Integrated Practices statements, they are suitable for both the Vajradhara and Ak�hobhya practitioners; in general, they serve for the taking [whichever] as chief from [among] the six clans, and are similar for both stages. As for creating the measureless mansion on the peak of Sumeru, it was explained previously in the con­text of the Mother Tantras, but is unnecessary here. The creation stage practitioner in this [Esoteric Community] context is capable of producing the distinctive orgasmic [wisdom intuition] by means of the four joys in all three occasions, the prime union, the entry into clear light at the end of the supreme mandala triumph, and the reliance on the actual science consort upon arising therefrom; therefore this is not the same as other [Tantras'] creation stage occasions. As for the supreme mandala triumph, once you enter the trance­union with the actual science consort, you create the habitat and inhabi­tant mandala in the mother's lotus. As for emitting Ak�hobhya, bringing him into oneself after radiating [many emanations of] him and so on, and thus becoming Anger Vajra, it is in terms of two clans; and you should do it correspondingly in terms of whatever other clan [lord] as chief [deity]. Having emitted [the deities] from Vairochana to Sumbharaja and having dissolved them into the thirty-one male and fe male yogi/nis of your retinue you should imagine them as indivisible. By meditating your retinue with deity yoga you eliminate the pride of ordinariness, and so should not be disturbed by that concept [of ordinariness]. As for the meaning of [the deities'] becoming components of your body mandala, those members of the retinue [303hl are the members of 159 sPrin shugs can, presumably another a dept with a tradition of personal instructions."},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact · 559 your body, visualizing the parts as of the nature of the [five] aggregates and so fo rth. Both you and your retinue should meditate in that way. In regard to [practicing] with the fi ve seal consorts and with the one seal consort, you should dissolve the [visualized deities] into whichever are actually there, and in the case of those who are not there , you should do the same dissolving each into their own place. In regard to the expression \"having pleased the entire circ le of the mandala,\" the Chag translation has \"having impassioned,\" which means that you have already re ached the supreme mandala triumph and you have pleased the deities by uniting in trance with the actual science consort, from the point of view of the deities being parts of your body. It is not only [a question of] just having united and entered into clear light, but it also means adding the medita­tions of yoga through the two contemplations and creating the four voids through the door of compressing the wind-energy-mind into the heart center, as previously explained. That is to be understood as applicable to other contexts of trance-union, though [ultimately] it is connected to the perfection stage itself. As for being exhorted by songs after immersing in clear light, you should visualize it in the extensive unelaborated [conduct] , in the case where there are four consorts in the inner corner directions meditated as Lochana and so forth, actually exhorting with song meditated as the fi ve Vajra [sense goddesses], and [to be visualized] in the case where there is but the single consort seal. Or else it is obvious also that it is also suitable that in the former case the four goddesses in this context are held with the pride of being Lochana and so on and so exhort [you].

When you are in the first three occasions of the perfection stage, and, having attained the beginning of the path of mind isolation, you are performing the conduct for the sake of the magic body, you can create it instantaneously without creating it from syllable and symbolic implement and so on. Above the measureless mansion, you create the intuition place, and on the occasion of compressing the visualization into clear light. it is compressed by the power of dissolving the wind-energies.

If you are a magic body [adept] it actually can be done, but when you enter the void while still not having realized the clea r light, it does not serve to purify the magic body. When you arise, it is an arisal of the mind from the metaphoric clear light and is not an arisal in a new body. When you attain communion [in the future], there is no interruption of the homogeneity of the magic body, so [at this stage] you should enter into and arise from the clear light basing [yourself] on the mind and not upon the magic body. Therefore, from both of those [stages], when you arise from clear light you should take up in your mind whatever [deity] body you already have [devel­oped] through the process of visualization. As for maintaining the emanation body, you should create your coarse body as an emanation body by bring back together what was sepa­rated from the coarse body. Though you have attained [only a measure of] virtual conformity with the magic body, you can make it similar to the actual [magic body] in the experience of your mentality. In those explanations, you should understand [their application to all three;] the occasion of the prime union [304hl, the creation of the orgas­mic [intuition] from union with the science consort at the end of the supreme mandala triumph, and the arisal from that and so forth. In the [Root Ta ntra] Seventeenth Chapter Commentary, as it explains that, after the arisal upon exhortation with song, you uphold the pride of the four clans such as Vairochana and you perform the unions with all four god­desses, Lochan� and so forth, it is clear that here also you must perform that, the same in both stages. And that corresponds with taking those four goddesses as the consorts who unite with the chief [deity]. Further, those uniting consorts, since they serve as the science consorts of the lord, are also clearly engaging as Rnpavajr� and so on also. By that reason, in the case of the medium and concise form of the unelaborated conduct, they are classified according to the number of the circle of science consorts and not according to the number of male [deities]. As for the Integrated Practices statement that you should perform relying on whichever of the five, such as low caste consorts and so forth, it is in terms of there being no certainty about caste for the perfection stage practitioner; the creation stage practitioner is explained as having a consort of his own clan.

There is no explicit explanation as to how often in a day you prac­tice this rite of the conduct, but since the Sixteenth Chapter Root Com­mentary states. in the context of the conduct, that you should make the secret offering while trance-united with the science consort in the fo ur times, l-' 05ul you should perform this in four sessions. The [Buddha} Union states that the group circle rite, re lying on the group mandala, should be performed once each year and once each month. The Integrated Practices, concerning its statement about the two latter conducts, as it is not referring to the conduct in the context of its explanation of the fo ur boundaries when performing the conduct, its meaning is not an explanation of whether or not there is elaboration of time in the conduct that has arrived at the high path of the two stages re lying on that scriptural reference. If you engage in the elaborated [con­duct] after engaging in textures, you perform from the perspective of your own specific meditation and intention concerning the seal gesture and its response; if you are [engaging in] the unelaborated [conduct], you do not perform [in that way].

As for the statement that you should eat in solitude, having cleansed and so on the five meats and the fi ve elixirs, it is similar for all the con­ducts of the two stages. As for the Integrated Practices statement that All this should be perfected by the inner self itself, with­out binding of the consort, neither painting a mandala nor offering [in it] the symbolic universe, not performing external hearth fire sacrifice, not making stupas for placing clay images and so forth, not reading scriptures, abandoning physical asceticism, not performing prostra­tions to painted or wood or stone carved icons, not taking refuge in saints or hermit buddhas, and not re lying on any astrology and so forth ..."},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"562 ·Brilliant Illumination oj the Lamp -this refers to the context of the conduct of the perfection stage; and does not include the context of conduct [on the creation stage; since it contains such a prohibition of] the binding of the seal consort [30Sb] and the painting of the mandala and so forth. By mistaking statements about not doing such things in the Community, and in many other Tantras, the Esoteric Accomplishment, and the Enlightenment Songs, and so on, it seems that many act even from the time of being a beginner in such a way that the sharp minded do not perform those practices instantaneously and the dull-minded do them more gradually. I VI.B.3.c.ii.c '2'-The way of achieving the extremely unelaborated conduct] Second, as for which embodiment should perform this extremely unelaborated conduct, Tsunmojen explains it is only the perfection stage practitioner and Kanhapa declares it can be anyone on the two stages; of these two you should take the latter as preferable, according to the view of Master Go. As for the place, you should use a solitary mountain, a riverbank, near a waterfall, and a charnel ground and so forth- you do not practice this in a three-storied house. As for the companion to provide your food, you should get a crea­ture such as a forest spirit devotee, or a superior practitioner companion, or get your food from a large [monastic] community. As for the latter, Pa­tsab translates \"by getting just your rice gruel from a minister,\" meaning that wealthy persons such as ministers should serve as patrons. If you can get a forest spirit devotee, since wealth comes with performing either the elaborated or unelaborated [conduct], it is not definite that this [extremely unelaborated conduct] is performed only for the reason of lack of wealth of equipment. As for the particulars of intention, there are four. First is when as a somewhat beginning practitioner you remember the beginningless suffer­ing of the life cycle and desire the bliss of nirvana, you should abandon all socializing, a nd finally you should meditate the notion of suffering even concerning the gaining of power t30ttuJ over the entire kingdom. Second, the two new translations are good, saying \"you should destroy any entertaining of even anything as much as a grain of sesamum,\" which should be interpreted as not holding onto any accumulation of equipment"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact · 563 such as a mere grain of sesamum, and you should not take it as meaning you should not identify the manifestations of the truth habits. Third, through your faith in meditating clear light as ultimate re ality, you should not be concerned for your body and life. Fourth. you should not be ambi­tious for the minor mundane accomplishments or the eight great [mun­dane) accomplishments. because they can become distractions and causes for regression. For a creation stage practitioner to perform the conduct, since s/he has the fully qualified spirit of enlightenment. granted s/he wants to attain buddhahood in general, since s/he performs the conduct with her/his mind attracted by common accomplishments, as long as s/he has not completed the creation stage and produced the perfection stages, except for the second intention, [s/he should fo cus on that, since] the other three apply only to the perfection stage practitioner. As for the distinctions of the seal consort, the Integrated Practices says160 that, thus, abandoning the outer consort, you should perceive your­self uniting rather with the wisdom consort abiding in the heart center, thinking \"thereby I will more quickly attain the vajradharahood,\" and you should perform the conduct only being alone, [meaning obviously that you should use] a wisdom consort. As for that wisdom consort, though Lak�hmi says that the creation stage practitioner brings fo rth the goddess with shape from within the heart center and the perfection stage practitioner unites with the wisdom seal just through his/her meditation on voidness, 1306bl it is rather the case that the perfection stage practi­tioner also unites with the wisdom seal as having the form of a goddess. The Illumination of the Lamp Fifth Chapter says that if you do not obtain an actual consort, you should bring forth the mother of buddhas, Tran­scendent Wisdom, from within your heart and perform union with her; and proves [that statement] with reasons. The Sixteenth Chapter [Root Ta ntraj says: Contemplatiing with the three syllable vajra, Visualize your own consort with your mind, Thereby the omniscient buddhas Will doubtless be delighted. 1 60The fo llowing closely paraphrases the canonical Tibetan (CW, p. 647)."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"564 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp The Commentary here says that this text teaches uniting with the wisdom seal, and that \"contemplating with the three syllable vajr a\" means that a three vajra yogi such as Vairochana, who has no concern for any outer consort, brings forth as his seal the Vajradhatvishvari who dwells in his heart. Thus, as for the explanation that \"if you cannot find an outer con­sort, rely on the wisdom consort,\" it implies that the [reliance on a] wis­dom seal cannot produce the samadhi of great bliss as [well as] the reli­ance on an external consort, and this intends that if you do find an outer consort, you should do the opposite of the previous statement about abandoning her and relying on the wisdom consort. Further, it is like the statement of the Illumination of the Lamp Seventeenth Chapter-both new translations-that those whose minds are not stable in union with the wisdom consort should rely on a physical consort. Though the old translation of the Illumination of the Lamp states that \"you should rely on the physical consort when your mind is stable,\" the above translations are better. Like that, [307al there seem to be particular [choices made] according to the type of a person and the way of learning with a wisdom consort after first meditating the path. In this regard, the creation stage practitioner may indeed give up other elaborations, but the stage of the procedure is clearly similar, so one unites with the wisdom seal when completing the mandala triumph, generating the orgasmic joy by the processes of the four joys and meditating bliss-void. Thereupon, you arise exhorted by the songs of the meditated goddesses, enjoying the food and the science consort's desire objects through your contemplative visualization. In the three occasions of the perfection stage, relying on the appropriate pro­cess of the procedure of the evocation, when you unite with the wisdom consort, by the force of your combining it with the perfection of the yoga of the inner winds, you cut off the many dualistic elaborations and realize a distinctively excellent four voids. Then again, from the process of com­pressing that gathers the wind-energy-mind in the heart center and the descent of the enlightenment spirit to the tip of the vajra, you have the ability to generate whatever possible of the four voids, but the main thing is to perform the previous [compression of the wind-energies in the heart center]. Concerning this, the Integrated Practices' explanation of the aggre­gates' etc. subtle elements entering into wind-energy, that into mind, that"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 565 into mental fu nctions, and that entering into misknowledge and after that your meditating the clear light-all this is performed relying on the wis­dom seal; in the other conducts it is similar but relying on an actual seal. Nevertheless, here the statement of cultivating the sleep clear light itself is on the occasion of the conduct of the perfection stage, and that again, by this, by intermittent [J07bl meditation of clear light, it seems to mean that you meditate with a merging of the clear light with sleep. And it does not mean that you perform separate ways of meditation of the clear light as on other occasions, when not merged with sleep but in waking time, and when merged with sleep in sleeping time. This you can understand when you understand all the keys of merging. Thus, when you practice by performing the conducts on the two stages, except for differences of degree of the four joys and the four voids, by both you entrance yourself and rely on union with the wisdom consort and cultivate the orgasmic [bliss] and clear light itself. When you cannot abide therein and so arise, again, relying on that consort and increase that meditation as before. Here, your creativity is extremely intense, you are averse to elaborations, and from the perspective of your intense faith in meditating the orgasmic [wisdom] you perform the con­duct as before; and this is called \"the bhusuku conduct,\" because it is to maintain the conduct of eating, sleeping, and evacuating. As fo llows, the first syllable derives etymologically by adding syllables from bhufijana and gives you \"eating food,\" sutana is explained as sleeping, and ku(isara is explained as evacuating by expelling excrement and urine. Except for just those three ideas, you abandon socializing, you don't consider body, sensations, objects, and senses, and you perform by merging sleep and clear light. Some also analyzed the bhu as coming from bhukta, again meaning \"to eat.\" By such a perfection stage conduct, you will be caused to swiftly attain the magic body where your actual being transform s, the learner's communion vajra body, and the non-learner's communion vajra body. without requiring the other two conducts. Thus the Sixth Chapter Com­mentary states that the \"bhusuku conduct\" is the supreme conduct. The Integrated Practices often cites the extremely unelaborated 1.\\llllal conduct as what you should explain as being the process explained by the Cra;:;y Di�·cipline Sarra, which occurs in the sixteenth chapter of the Vajra Essence Ornament Ta ntra.

By engaging in the conduct according to both that Ta ntra and the Community, the goal to be achieved by that being practiced for six months is the exaltation of buddhahood; hence that is not the conduct of the creation stage. The Integrated Practices declares that by learning the three con­ducts in a fortnight, or one month, or six months, the eight signs of the universal seal, such as subtle form and light texture, etc., and the dream signs stated in the [Root] Ta ntra Fifteenth Chapter will emerge. You will achieve whenever those signs emerge, even before six months. In that regard, the eight masteries such as mastery of the body are supreme accomplishments, as the Chag translation says: Subtle matter and light touch, True attainment, true pervasiveness, Firm extreme illumination itself­Mastery 1308bJ itself and all fulfillment. These eight are called the \"eight excellences of mastery,\" and not the \"eight masteries.\" As to their meaning being explained by the previous, it seems that you cannot find an explanation of the eight excellences of mastery, so you should apply the explanation of the eight excellences of mastery by Avalokitavrata. Regarding that, such mastery involves the subtle causing the creation and destruction of the world of beings, the light causing of the creation and destruction of the world of things, and the ownership of the creation and destruction of both of them; so here the yogi/ni has the ability to emanate and dissolve those things. The latter is shown by \"true attainment.\" Going wherever the mind thinks [to go] is indicated by \"true pervasiveness.\" Being worshipped by all elemental spirits is shown by one's appearing extremely illuminating and overwhelming all others by light and majesty. \"Mastery\" is having the power to [both] punish and support beings. As an excellence, developing the power of fulfillment is to possess \"all fulfillment.\" This is shown by"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact· 567 the ability to get whatever you want to get, relying on abiding in fu lfilled delight. Attaining the supreme in less than six months refers to the attaining of the Ieamer's union. When you perform the conducts on the four occa­sions previously explained, since you practice until you attain your frui­tion, you do not calculate whether or not there is the elaboration of time. Although you have practiced conduct thus by the two stages, if you do not swiftly achieve the fruition of each particular occasion, as for the way of being urged along I-�09nJ each of the two stages, you should under­stand it from the Root Ta ntra Te nth Chapter Commentary and Naropa's Further Ta ntra Commentary. [VI.B.4. -How the fruition will be attained at meditation's end] Fourth, as for the way of realizing the fruition at the end of medi-tating the path, the Illumination of the Lamp declares: Further the need is to be explained, The ritual procedures of peace and so on, Likewise the eight accomplishments, And buddhahood as the supreme. Thus, buddhahood is best, the eight great accomplishments is medium, and the deeds of peace, growth, power, and terror is least. As for the eight accomplishments, the Wi sdom Vajra Compendium directly mentions six and omits two: Mantra, medicine, fire-sacrifice, powder, eye-salve, swift­fo ot, and so on, the eight great accomplishments. The Four Goddess Dialogue explains the achievement of the eight substances and the limbs: Pills, and eye-salve medicines, The underground, the sword accomplishment, Flying in the sky, invisibility, Deathlessness, and healing sicknesses. The Vajra Pavilion says: Eye-salve, speed-travel, Sword , underground accomplishments,"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"568 · Brilliant Illumination of the Lamp Pill, sky-walking, Invisibility, and fasting. The latter two fruitions [eight accomplishments and four deeds], are collected in the common accomplishments, giving two kinds, supreme and common, as the Further Ta ntra says: The accomplishments of invisibility, and so on, Are explained as the ordinary [ones]; Buddha proclaimed the attainment of buddhahood, To be the supreme accomplishment. At the end of learning the creation stage and its conduct, [309bJ as for the way of achieving the common accomplishments, you can understand it from reading the Ta ntra Commentary. At the end of learning the perfection stage and its conduct, as for the way of achieving the nonlearner's communion, it is as previously explained. When you have realized the pre-dawn clear light transparence through the two enlightenments outer and inner, at the time of the mani­festation of the ultimate truth body, the learner's communion magic body becomes the nonlearner's communion magic body, and you abide without deviating from those two bodies as long as the samsaric life cycle lasts [for other beings]. As for the objective clear light transparence endowed with two such purities, it is ca lled the \"uncreated truth body,\" the \"subjective clear light intuition truth body,\" and the \"great bliss body.\" Its support embodiment matter body is the beatific body made of wind-energy-mind only, those two bodies being [merely] conceptually different but one in actuality, frequently referred to as the \"intuition body nondual with the matter body,\" so you should understand that the claim that the Noble father and sons' positions are that the matter body is not included in the buddha-stage but only in the continuum of the disciples, that the matter body is [coarsely] material and actually different from consciousness, and that there is no intuitive wisdom in the context of fruition, and so forth, is not a valid claim. Such a communion body creates many emanations such as the supreme emanation body, and having taken the emanation body com­munion body as one, you can understand well the arrangement of the two [beatific and truth] bodies in the communion body. In other Mantra"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Chapter XI-Conduct Heightening Impact · 569 treatises there certainly are explanations of emanation body matter body as embodiment of intuitive wisdom, mind as 13lllu l truth body. and speech as beatific body, but the position of the father and sons is as above. As previously explained. at the end of other paths you add the distinctive mantric path and attain buddhahood in Akani�hta heaven, and that is accepted as unexcelled buddhahood. However, that does not con­tradict the explanation of attaining buddhahood in an embodiment that desires buddhahood in one lifetime from entering the unexcelled path from the beginning: because positing buddhahood through the unexcelled system and attaining buddhahood having entered the unexcelled path from the beginning do not have the same meaning. You can understand from what was explained above the subtle differences of the systems of achieving the truth and matter bodies of these two kinds of buddhahoods. As for attaining buddhahood in the embodiment of a magic body person who has attained the magic body in a human embodiment, it is easy to understand how that is buddhahood in a human embodiment. When a yogi/ni in a human embodiment, having given up his/her human lifespan, achieves the magic body in place of becoming a between being, that embodiment for attaining buddhahood in that embodiment, though it is not included in the six migrations of beings, is not contradicted; just as, for example, the non-returner [saint] attains nirvana in the between and attains arhatship in that [between] embodiment. Having meditated such a path, one abides in the buddha beatific body with its seven components, but there is no certainty about the ema­nation body. Therefore, as for the sky union component of the beatific body, it is declared that it creates the bestowal of the great bliss of play through the entrancement of union with many science companions such as the orgasmic [science consorts], [Jlllbl and in conformity with that fr ui­tion, in the time of the path, one performs totally expansive great bliss by the way of playing with the desire objects of youth and beauty.

If you do not understand well the lower paths and theories from which this is distinctive, then you will not understand the subtle and extraordinary distinctive specialties of the higher paths and theories. And especially, if you do not develop the precise intellectual discernment derived from cultivating the ultimate, definitive meaning, profound voidness and the definitive meaning Sutras, and the extremely subtle reasoning processes of the Savior Nagarjuna, you will not discover the key of the general path that leads to liberation and omniscience.

Further, through intensive practice I conducted far-reaching investiga­tions concerning the way of leading the disciple through the processes of the completion of the body of each particular path, adorned by the specific appropriate personal instruction, concerning the determining of voidness and, having determined it, meditating it, and concerning the way of explaining the specific systems of the Community as above explained.

The stores of (I) merit and of (2) wisdom; all deeds of bodhisattvas contribute to their accumulation of these two stores, which ultimately culminate in the buddha bodies of matter (rapakaya) and of truth (dharmakaya). two realities (sometimes \"truths\") (satyadvaya).

The migrations in: (I) hell, (2) the limbo of hungry ghosts, or (3) the animal kingdom. three bodies of the Buddha (trikiiya). (I) The \"truth body\" (dharmakaya), (2) the \"beatific body\" (sambhogakiiya), and (3) the \"emanation body\" (nirmat�akaya). A buddha is no longer an ordinary being, a self-habit-ridden individual caught inside his skin. Bud­dhists have developed a number of ways to express the extraordinary qualities of the experience of enlightenment. The three bodies is one of the most important of these. The ordinary mind at enlightenment expands in an experience of oneness with the infinity of beings and things, which becomes a permanent awareness, called the body of truth or reality. This is the highest fruit of wisdom, a state of virtual omniscience­nirvana-a perfect, ultimate freedom, and the uttermost fulfillment of all selfish con­cerns. At the same time, the ordinary speech and body do not lose their continua of life. Body and speech are seen by Buddhists as being interactive with others: body reaches out from self-centeredness to touch other persons and things; speech communi­cates the content of mind to others, linking mind to mind. Therefore the continuum of speech expands as a celebration of the mind's attainment of infinite oneness, becoming a consummate and infinite joy experienced as a body of beatitude; a sort of subtle or ethereal body made of the sheer joy at being free of suffering, at having realized the absolute nature of reality. It is as infinite as reality, a subtle radiant omnipresence of a buddha's joy throughout all things. Finally, the continuum of ordinary body expands 627"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"628 · Glossary of Numerical Categories with enlightenment into an emanation body; a limitless number of individuated mani­fe stations arises out of the background energy of the beatific body when a buddha spontaneously interacts with ordinary beings who cannot perceive their oneness with the beatific presence in and around them and persist in the misknowing individual theater of suffering and alienation. F or the buddhas, infinite mind and speech magically create whatever gross embodiments are appropriate to relate to such beings, liberate them from their suffering, and ultimately inspire them to discover their own enlighten­ment and beatitude. These three buddha bodies are aligned with the ordinary processes of death, between, and life, with sleep, dream, and waking, as well as with mind, speech, and body. three concentrations (samadhi). ( 1) The heroic meditation (surarh gam4, (2) the illusory meditation (mayopama), and (3) the adamantine meditation (vajropama). three conducts (carya- spyod pa). These three are: (1) the elaborated conduct, (2) the on­elaborated conduct, and (3) the extremely unelaborated conduct. They are special life­styles adopted by the Tantric adept on either the creation stage or the perfection stage level. They were somewhat scandalous by ancient or modern codes of social and sexual behavior, but perhaps less so in the Jess puritanical and aesthetically sophisti­cated urban and court society of ancient India. They are meant to be esoteric, yet throughout Tantric history definitely inspired imitation by people not at all at the level of insight and yogic self-mastery required to pursue such exercises. Thus they gave Tantric adepts a bad name in some quarters. They are part of the \"crazy discipline\" (unmattavrata - myon pa 'i brtul bzhug) that aims to transform the pride of ordinari­ness of perception and conception into the vivid vision of purified perception of self and others and the environmental world. The elaborated is suitable only for adepts of great wealth and social position-such as kings and the like-in that it involves elabo­rate residences, elegant equipment and dress and musical organizations, and the assem­bling of a cast of actors who are all on the path and are adepts of some level in their own right. The unelaborated is simpler and easier to keep esoteric. The extremely un­elaborated is very sparse, involved only a couple and a very modest, retreated lifestyle. three defilements (mala).

(1) The first contemplation is the attainment of the joy and bliss (prrtisukha) arising from solitude and freedom from desires and sins. (2) The second is the attainment of the joy and bliss arising from the cessation of discursive thought. (3) The third is the attainment of equanimity, with mindfulness, awareness, and physical ease, and beyond any feeling of joy. (4) The fourth is the utter purity of awareness of equanimity, without pleasure or pain, elation or depression. These four contemplations combine with the four trances (see entry) and the final state of utter cessation to form the nine sequential states (anupiirvavihara) leading to the highest liberation. These contemplations also correspond to the four divine bodes (brahma­vihara), which respectively subdivided into three, three, tree, and seven layers of heavens where pure matter realm deities dwell. four applications of mindfulness (smrtyupasthana ).

In Ve dic India it was the weapon of the tribal fat her-god, lndra, a thunderbolt that he threw down from the heavens to break the citadels of the enemy. The Buddhists took this primal symbol of the supreme power of the universe and made it a symbol of universal love and compassion, in order to affirm their vision that love is the strong force in the universe.

This word has been translated \"passion,\" and more recently \"affliction,\" neither wrong. Its etymology comes from the verb root klis-to \"torment,\" \"twist,\" so it is definitely something painful. Lust, hatred. delusion, envy. pride, fanaticism-all emotions that are painful to experience-cause painful outcomes through unskillful interactions with others. Passion is an intense emotion that can how­ever be exalting and beautiful, or at least it has that connotation (granted the passion of Christ was definitely painful). Affliction is basically the same as suffering, not as much a cause of suffering. An addiction is a habitual behavior that seems to benefit one's state of being and so seduces the addict, but actually causes suffering to the addict and those around him or her. One can be addicted to lust, addicted to hate, addicted to confusion, to a fanatical belief, to pride or envy or avarice. Those addictions then inevitably cause suffering and affliction. aggregate (skandha). The five- rapa, vedana, samjna, samskara, and vijnana-have such a particular technical sense that some may wish to leave them untranslated. Nevertheless, it seems preferable to give a translation-in spite of the drawbacks of each possible term-in order to convey the same sense of a useful schema of the psychophysical complex. (1) For rapa, \"matter\" is preferred to \"form\" because it more concretely connotes the physical and gross. (2) For vedana, \"sensation\" is preferred to \"feelings,\" as not so inclusive of emotions. (3} For samjiiil, \"perception\" is preferable to \"conception,\" as itself meaning conceptually determined experience. (4} For samskilra, which covers a number of mental functions as well as anomalous forces, \"creation\" or \"function\" gives the general idea. (5} And \"consciousness\" is so well established for vijnana (although what we normally think of as consciousness is more like samjiiil, i.e., conceptual and notional, and vijnana is rather the \"pure awareness\" prior to concepts} as to be left unchallenged.

The opposite of this kind of noble person is one who is enclosed within a sense of exclusive and absolute self as different from and opposed to others, and who thus does not consider others' perspective from any visceral level.

The sustained visualization of such an embodiment in the creation stage practice aims to develop such a stability of focus that when the perfection stage practitioner reaches into the subtle out-of-body zones in simulation of death and dying states, he or she can arise for the subtle energy plane in the archetypal form of whatever is his or her chosen embodi­ment. Such a buddha-form can be approached as an independent being in some ritual and contemplative and narr ative contexts, while it can also be adopted as a contempla­tive role-model, in practices in which the yogrlni identifies with the deity and seeks to become the deity itself.

Sanskrit sukha means \"happiness\" as the opposite of duljcha , \"suffering,\" in a range from modest relief and comfort up to physical orgasmic bliss and supreme spiritual bliss. In the Tantric context, the Universalist emphasis on compassion (the will to relieve the suffering of others) transmutes into the implementa­tion of love (the will to pr ovide happiness to others) and so the conscious cultivation of bliss becomes a technical concern. To transmit happiness to others, one must develop one's own happiness to overflowing. Thus, the highest Tantric expression of the non­duality of relative and absolute realities is the term \"bliss-void indivisible,\" where bliss is the relative, wisdom-generated forms of the buddhaverse and void is the ultimate freedom reality that makes such creativity possible."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"644 · Glossary of Unique Translation Te rms bodhisattva. Sanskrit bodhisattva is composed of bodhi, meaning \"enlightenment\" (wisdom of selflessness/selfless compassion), and sattva, meaning \"being\" or \"hero/ heroine.\" Most simply, it means someone who has dedicated him or herself to do what­ever it takes over countless lifetimes in order to attain perfect enlightenment in order to save all beings from suffering. A being becomes a bodhisattva by conceiving the spirit of enlightenment, through ( 1) imagining the possibility of enlightened consciousness, (2) seeing how it alone gives the ability effectively to help others find their happiness, (3) seeing how dedicating all one's lives of efforts toward that goal is the only sensible way to live, and (4) resolving to undertake that universal responsibility oneself. This transformation from ordinary being to \"enlightenment hero/heroine\" is formally sealed by the solemn taking of the vow of the bodhisattva. Thus a beginner bodhisattva need not be very advanced in enlightenment, merely firmly dedicated to universal love and compassion. In the modern context, it is important to mention that the messianic bodhisattva vow only makes sense for those who feel convinced that they are going to be around in the life-process for an infinite future in any case, so they might as well undertake the saving of all beings. Such a messianic complex would be insane for those who consider their existence to last only one lifetime; there would never be time for such a universal saving of beings, and so such a pressure would be pointless. body isolation.

This word is often translated as \"family,\" which has the modern connotation of nuclear family, i.e., parents and children. \"Clan\" conveys the ancient extended family which includes cousins, uncles, and aunts, and so forth, which is more appropriate for the buddha-kula, which includes a larger number of members. The five clans are the vajra, buddha, jewel, lotus, and evolution clans, respectively fathered by the five Buddhas, Ak�hobhya, Vairochana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi, mothered by the female buddhas, Sparshavajra, Lochana, Mamakr, Pat;�c;laravasinr, and Tara, and each including a number of male and female bodhisattvas, fierce deities, and adept heroes and heroines. clear light, transparence (prabhasvara-'od gsa{). This is the level of the extremely subtle bodymind, the indestructible drop and the state of universal void. It is likened to the gray light before the dawn, when you can see your hand but not the lines in the palm; this follows with the moonlit sky of luminance, the sunlit sky of radiance, and the darklit or unlit light of imminence. Clear light is thus a pure transparency, beyond the duality of light and dark, day and night, when there are no shadows because everything is self-illuminated from within.

See \"five stages.\" conception of the spirit of enlightenment (bodhicittotpada). This can also be rendered by \"initiation of ... \" because it means the mental event occurring when a living being, having been exposed to the teaching of the Buddha or of his magical emanations, realizes simultaneously his own level of conditioned ignorance. The living being's habitual stream of consciousness is like sleep compared to that of one who has awakened from ignorance; with initiation, he has the possibility of his own attainment of a higher state of consciousness; and the necessity of attaining it in order to liberate other living beings from their stupefaction. Having realized this possibility, he becomes inspired with the intense ambition to attain, and that is called the \"conception of the spirit of enlightenment.\" \"Spirit\" is preferred to \"mind\" because the mind of enlightenment should rather be the mind of the Buddha; and it is preferred to \"thought\" because a \"thought of enlightenment\" can easily be produced without the initiation of any sort of new resolve or awareness. conceptualization (vikalpa). This brings up another important group of words that has never been treated systematically in translation: vikalpa, parikalpa, samllropa, adhyll­ropa, kalpana, samjiiil, and prapanca. All of these refer to mental functions that tend to superimpose upon reality, either relative or ultimate, a conceptualized reality fabri­cated by the subjective mind. Some translators have tended to lump these together under the rubric \"discursive thought,\" which leads to the misleading notion that all thought is bad, something to be eliminated, and that sheer ''thoughtlessness\" is \"enlightenment,\" or whatever higher state is desired. According to Buddhist scholars. thought in itself is simply a function, and only thought that is attached to its own content over and above the relative object, i.e., \"egoistic\" thought, is bad and to be eliminated.

Sometimes the father and mother in a buddha-father-mother couple are considered different divine beings, sometimes only the double manifestation of a single being. The Buddhist belief is that all beings, whatever the superficial sexual identity, are potentially both male and female -each has male and female aspects and energies in his or her being. The empathetic ability to transcend sexual identity-habits is cultivated by Tantric archetype meditation wherein a male will meditate himself as a female archetype buddha, a fe male will meditate herself as a male archetype buddha, or either will meditate him or her self as a male and fe male buddha couple in union. continuum (tantra -rgyud, rgyun).

Sometimes, exoterically, it is known as \"life-continuum\" (sam tina): the energy-continuity of a living being that proceeds from moment to moment in a life and from life to life in an individual's evolutionary progression. To quote Tsong Khapa, quoting in his great commentary the Esoteric Community Further Tantra and Naropa: \"Tantra is renowned as 'continuum'; that continuum is of three types: differentiated in terms of the basis (adhara), likewise, nature (prakrti), and non-deprivation (asariz­hllrya). As for their aspects, the nature one is the cause; similarly, the non-deprivation is the fru ition; the basis is called the art. Those three comprise the meaning of 'tantra.' (GST, xviii.34--35) The etymological definition of 'tantra' is 'continuum.' According to Naropa's explanation of the threefold division of Tantra in the verse, 'nature' means the nature of the jewel-like adept; this is the causal Tantra. 'Basis' refers to the art Tantra, the four branches of service and performance of the two stages.

This is the point of freedom when the subtle mind, indestructible clear light drop, or soul of a particular life loses connection with the embodiment of that life. It is perhaps beyond consciousness and unconsciousness, though ordinary people transit it unconsciously, never noticing the all-too-rapid (for them) transition from the uncon­scious segment of imminence into clear light and back into imminence. Thus death is understood as 11 pure negation, a perfect zero, 11 timeless moment, a widthless boundary, and is aligned with absolute reality, with the body of truth, with the ultimate clear light. A buddha, an enlightened being, is thus one whose death is an infinite body of ultimate reality, a concrete permanent resting place, which nevertheless not only never obstructs their relative experience of the interconnected realm of beings. it makes it indivisible from freedom and openness and therefore perfectly blissful. Needless to say, such a being is no longer afraid of death. definitive meaning (nrtartha). This refers to those teachings of the Buddha that are in terms of ultimate reality; it is opposed to those teachings given in terms of relative reality, termed \"interpretable meaning,\" because they require further interpretation before being relied on to indicate the ultimate. Hence definitive meaning relates to voidness, etc., and no statement concerning the relative world, even by the Buddha, can be taken as definitive. designation (prajflapti).

As the Buddha is cl early described in the Siltras as the \"Supreme Teacher of Gods and Men,\" there seems little danger that he may be confused with any particular deity through the use of this term (as indeed in Buddhist Sotras various deities, creators, protectors, etc., are shown in their respective roles).

This word refers to physical, chemical essences (something like the modem notion of neuro-transmitters) that focus awareness within the subtle nervous system. In the subtle body, the channels form the structure, the winds serve as the energies that move things and cause transformations of experience, and the drops serve as the nodes of subjectivity that focus awareness within this realm that opens up when consciousness has been withdrawn from its functions in receiving and coordinating sense-data from the gross senses. These drops are also associated with the genetic material that is the essence of the male and female sexual fluids, and the yogic mastery of their subtle potentials represents the sublimation of the creative energies that ordinarily build up the suffering life cycle into the reconstruction of the divine realm of the enlightened mandala. Thus, red drops refer to the female genetic essence, carried within the blood, and the white drops refer to the male genetic essence, carried within the semen. This is a difficult and abstruse subject, but this note can orient you to what is meant by this expression. duality, dualism (dvaya, dvayagraha). \"Duality\" is largely self-explanatory.

The modem materialistic worldview considers the structures of our present lifetimes to have been caused by the genetic re-embodiment of the subtly encoded experiences of millions of previous representatives of our species through the pro­cesses of biological evolution. The Buddhist world view considers the structures of our present lifetimes to be caused by the spiritually genetic re-embodiment of our own experiences from millions of previous lifetimes, subtly encoded in a spiritual gene we bring with us, combined with the physical genes we receive from our parents, in a complex process of spiritually directed and physically conditioned biological evolution. extremely subtle bodymind.

This bliss is the secret engine of universal compassion also, as it remains with the enlightened being in no matter what circumstance, and spontaneously over­flows to lift suffering beings out of their trap of alienation into the bliss of which they also are made. The art (upaya) of doing that is necessary because the alienated being will only get more bound tight by simply a flood of energy, even if it is really bliss: so the blissed out compassionate being must create an entertainment that will attract the alienated beings according to their inclinations and open their minds to understand their deeper realities. great, or universal, compassion (mahiikarur:zll). This refers to one of the two central quali­ties of a Buddha or high bodhisattva (see \"enlightenment\" entry): his feeling born of the wish for all living beings to be free of suffering and to attain the supreme happi­ness. It is important to note that this great compassion has nothing to do with any senti­mental emotion such as that stimulated by such a reflection as \"Oh, the poor creatures! How they are suffering!\" On the contrary, great compassion is accompanied by the clear awareness that ultimately there are no such things as living beings, suffering, etc., in reality.

It is divided into two halves. an initial moment when there is a consciousness of intense darkness, and a second moment of total unconsciousness. It is called \"imminence\" (upalabdhi-nyer thob) because it is the state where ultimate reality clear light is about to occur in consciousness, where it is imminent. Its syno­nyms are \"neuter,\" \"the perfect,\" \"consciousness,\" \"delusion,\" \"equal reality,\" (these in common with Sotra usages), and \"HOM,\" \"luminance-imminence,\" \"great void,\" \"misknowledge,\" and \"medium passion.\" indestructible drop (ak$arabindu - mi shigs pa 'i thig /e). This is the extremely subtle bodymind of a sentient being, more or less qualifying as the \"soul\" urva) continuum that takes rebirth life after life and eventually becomes self-aware and expands into being the truth bodymind of all buddhas. During the life of a being, from conception to death, it resides in the central chamber of the heart center channel wheel. \"Death\" is defined as the moment when the sixfold neural knot around that central chamber un­ravels and the indestructible drop departs into the clear light of universal void. This is not subjectively perceived by an ordinary being who, after a time of unconsciousness, arises in the subtle dreamlike body of the between state. In the case of a bodhisattva attaining buddhahood (either after three incalculable eons of bodhisattva deeds) or in the context of the unexcelled yoga Tantra perfection stage called mind objective (perhaps both), the unraveling of the heart knot is done consciously and carefully. The yogi/ni remains consciously aware during the descent through the three luminance gnosis intuitions into the clear light extremely subtle place where the duality of micro and macro is also transcended.

This subtle body seems to be a kind of death-birth-between embodiment, resembling a conscious dream embodiment, and holds (is made of) the extremely subtle mind of great bliss clear light. It is needed to compress eons of altruistic bodhisattva lifetimes into the single life of the perfection stage adept, in order to realize the matter body of a buddha that manifests the merit and compassion side of the truth body of a buddha. mandala (maf)t/ala- dkyil 'khor).

The guru figure returns to esoteric Buddhism in the context of initiation, and for the depth psychological purpose of guiding the advanced spiritual adventurer who seeks reality and the attainment of buddhahood by diving into the unconscious realm of instincts and lucidly experiencing and mastering the processes of life and death. Though the Sanskrit word means \"heavy\" and so connotes the weight of the patriarchal authority figure, the Tibetan word fits with the \"unexcelled\" idea of Unexcelled Yoga (see entry) and so connotes a relationship beyond that of father or mother, rather the all embracing immanence of the buddha presence which is actually indivisible from even the ignorant being, and thus infuses the disciple with the buddha­presence, rather than holding it above as something far away and unattainable. Cer­tainly, the Tantric initiation doesn't \"take\" unless the recipient visualizes the mentor as indivisible from Vajradhara Buddha himself (or herself as with Vajrayogini). But the point then of the initiation is to ritually and contemplatively open the door in the recipient's imagination for his or her own identity with the Vajradhara Buddha. Thus the lama mentor serves more as an exemplar of person-buddha communion in order for the disciple practitioner to find that same communion with him or herself. The relation­ship is abused when the reception of initiation becomes a justification for worship of the lama, as if the lama was more one with the buddha than the disciple; such an initia­tion only makes a disciple feel less empowered and more dependent on the lama, rather than empowered to discover the buddha reality of him or herself. mind isolation (cittaviveka-sems dben).

The opposite of samsara, the blowing away of suffering, the peace that surpasseth all understanding. the supreme good, the actual reality of the universe. In the dualistic Buddhism of the Individual Vehicle, it is repre­sented as a place apart from the world of samsara, an otherworldly elsewhere where the liberated saint could go to freedom, though Buddha was careful not to pr esent it as a state of annihilation. Its highest fonn was called \"nirvana without reminder.\" In the nondualist Universal Vehicle teaching. nirvana and samsara were taught to be ulti­mately the same. though relatively still opposite, and the highest nirvana was called \"unlocated,\" rather than \"remainderless.\" Thus, this very world, if understood by an enlightened mind, was revealed to actually be nirvana, a place of abundant happiness, bliss. freedom. love, and compassion. The task then for the bodhisattva is to destroy the ignorance that prevents us from knowing that bliss, and then share the discovered bliss with beings still caught in suffering by ignorance. nonapprehension (anupalambha- dmigs med). This refers to the mental openness cultivated by the bodhisattva who has reached a certain awareness of the nature of reality, in that he or she does not seek to apprehend any object or grasp any substance in anything; rather, he or she removes any static pretension of the mind to have grasped at any truth, conviction, or view. nonduality (advayatvll).

A Tantric concept, where the world as perceived by the unenlightened is considered ordinary, because of being maintained by delusion and filled with suffering.

However, in the Madhyamika context, which is an important context in this text, pratTtya.mmutpada describes ultimate reality.

It is crucial to understand what is meant by \"self,\" before one is able to realize the all-important \"selflessness.\" Before we can discover an absence, we have to know what we are looking for, what we have been assuming to be present. In all Buddhist teachings, there is a self of persons (subjectivities) and a self of things (objectivities), both presumed habitually by living beings and hence informative of their perceptions. Were these \"selves\" to exist as they appear because of our presump­tion, they should exist as substantial, self-subsistent entities within things, or as the intrinsic realities of things, or as the intrinsic identities of things, all permanent, unrelated and nonrelative, etc. The nondiscovery of such \"selves\" within changing,"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"658 · Glossary of Unique Translation Te rms relative. interdependent persons and things is the realization of ultimate reality, or selflessness. selflessness (anatmata, or nairatmya). This describes actual reality, as finally there is no enduring person himself or herself or thing-in-itself, since persons and things exist only in the relative. conventional, or superficial sense, and not in any ultimate or absolute sense. To understand Buddhist teaching correctly, we must be clear about the two senses (conventional/ultimate, or relative/absolute), since mistaking denial of ultimate self as denial of conventional self leads to nihilism, and mistaking affirmation of conventional self as affirmation of ultimate self leads to absolutism. Nihilism and abso­lutism effectively prevent us from realizing our enlightenment, hence are very much to be avoided. signlessness (animitta). In ultimate reality, there is no sign, as a sign signals or signifies something to someone and hence is inextricably involved with the relative world. We are so conditioned by signs that they seem to speak to us as if they had a voice of their own. The letter \"A\" seems to pronounce itself to us as we see it, and the stop-sign fairly shouts at us. However, the configuration of two slanted lines with a crossbar has in itself nothing whatsoever to do with the phenomenon made with the mouth and throat in the open position. when expulsion of breath makes the vocal cords resonate \"ah.\" By extending such analysis to all signs, we may get an inkling of what is meant by \"signlessness,\" which is essentially equivalent to voidness, and to wishlessness. soul (atisiildmacitta, bindu, gotra, sam tina, jrva -shin tu phra mo 'i sems, gnyugs sems, thig /e, rigs, rgyun, srog). That which is the deepest personal essence of a living being, the super-subtle continuum which journeys from life to life and takes rebirth, and which becomes enlightened finally. The Buddha's famous teaching of selflessness has often been translated in the past as \"soul-lessness,\" and was used to confirm the Western sense that Buddhism is nihilistic and atheistic. The Buddha rejected any absolute, unchanging, fixed, intrinsically substantial, intrinsically identifiable soul, just as he rejected the same kind of intrinsically real self or ego, and the same kind of intrinsi­cally real rock, or tree, or entity, of any kind. But relative, changing, relational, living, conventional entities that can usefully be termed ego, self, or soul are never prohibited in Buddhist psychology. soul-ejection (*c:yuta -'pho ba). This is a special yogic method of, anticipating the moment of a normal death, consciously ejecting the indestructible drop soul-continuum from out of the heart center of a particular coarse embodiment up though the central channel and out the crown of the head into a buddha-realm.

The coarse mind of fivefold sense-consciousnesses dissolves here into the subtle mind that manifests in this neural network body and consists of the eighty sub­conscious instinctual natures (prakrti), distributed into three intuition zones, called luminance, radiance, and imminence (experienced as white, red, and blue-black empty spaces): these only appear when the instincts have been calmed by concentration on voidness and the injection of their mounts the neural wind-energies into the central channel.

This is itemized under the \"six transcendences\" (see Numerical Categories Glossary). Here we are concerned with the \"intuitive tolerance of the birthlessness (or incomprehensibility) of all things\" (anutpattika­dharmakStlnti or anupalabdhidharmaksllnti). To translate ksllnti as \"knowledge\" or \"conviction\" defeats entirely the Sanskrit usage and its intended sense. In the face of birthlessness or incomprehensibility (i.e., the ultimate reality), ordinary knowledge and especially convictions are utterly lost. This is because the mind sees through the objectifiability of anything and has nothing to grasp, and its process of coming to terms may be described only as a conscious cancellation through absolute negations of any false sense of certainty about anything.

Conze's pioneering work with the Sotras of transcendent wisdom, which is there­fore fine, even standard. I prefer \"transcendence,\" as it conveys the ambiguity in the Sanskrit and Tibetan terms of a \"going beyond,\" for those languages have other terms for complete or perfect. Thus \"transcendent wisdom\" is a degree of wisdom that goes beyond wisdom. as well as being a wisdom that goes beyond all ignorance. A transcen­dent generosity goes beyond generosity, as it bears a selfless awareness that doesn't perceive any giver, recipient or act of giving, and just naturally, effortlessly happens. transcendent insight (vipasyana -/hag mthong). This is paired with \"mental quiescence.\" In general \"meditation\" is too often understood as only the types of practices catego­rized as \"quietistic\" - which eschew objects, learning, analysis, discrimination. etc .. and lead only to the attainment of temporary peace and one-pointedness. However, in order to reach any high realization, such as personal selflessness, phenomenal selfless­ness, or voidness, \"transcendent insight,\" with its analytical penetration to the nature of ultimate reality, is indispensable. The analysis is called \"transcendent\" because it does not accept anything it sees as it appears. Instead, through analytic examination, it penetrates to its deeper reality, going ever deeper in infinite penetration until tolerance is reached. All apparently self-sufficient objects are seen through and their truth-status is rejected -first conceptually and finally perceptually, at buddhahood.

It is a pure negation of the ultimate existence of anything or, in Buddhist terminology, the \"voidness with respect to subjective and objective selves,\" or \"with respect to intrinsic identity,\" or \"with respect to intrinsic nature,\" or \"with respect to essential substance,\" or \"with respect to self-existence established by intrinsic identity,\" or \"with respect to ultimate truth-status,\" etc. Thus voidness is a concept descriptive of the ultimate reality through its pure negation of whatever may be supposed to be ultimately real, including itself. It is an absence, hence not existent in itself. It is synonymous therefore with \"infinity,\" \"absolute,\" etc., themselves all negative terms, i.e., formed etymologically from a positive concept by adding a negative prefix (in + finite = not finite; ab + solute = not compounded, etc.). But, since our verbally conditioned mental functions are habituated to the connection of word and thing, we tend to hypostatize a \"void,\" analogous to \"outer space,\" a \"vacuum,\" etc., which we either shrink from as a nihilistic nothingness or become attached to as a liberative nothingness; this great mistake can be cured only by realizing the meaning of the \"voidness of voidness,\" which brings us to the tolerance of inconceivability (see \"tolerance\"). wind-energy (vayu -rlung).
