The reasons for this volume are to present hitherto untranslated materials on this text (mainly its Indian commentar­ies and early Tibetan materials on it) and to shed new light on what is called “the meditative tradition of the Maitreya texts” as well as the Uttaratantras connections with Mahàmudrà and Shentong.1Though there are a number of translations of the verses of the Ut­taratantra, the only two pioneering English renderings of its commentary Ratnagotravibhâgavyâkhyâ (RGVV), by Obermiller (from the Tibetan) and Takasaki (from the Sanskrit and Chinese), are quite outdated at this point. This volume contains a new translation of both the Uttaratantra and R G W from the Sanskrit and Tibetan, which is further informed by Vairo- canaraksitas (eleventh/twelfth century) brief commentary (unavailable at the time of the earlier translations). The book also contains translations of Sajjanas (eleventh century) Mahàyânottaratantropadesa (a versified syn­opsis of the Uttaratantra) and two never-translated Tibetan commentaries, one by a student of Marpa Dopa Chokyi Wangchug2 (1042-1136) and the other by Dümo Dashi Oser3 (late fifteenth to sixteenth century; a student of the Seventh Karmapa and principal teacher of the Eighth). The former commentary (CMW) is one of the earliest Tibetan commentaries on both the Uttaratantra and R G W . The latter commentary incorporates the top­ical outline of the Uttaratantra by the Third Karmapa. In addition, this volume includes translations of several short texts that are based on the Ut­taratantra and RGW , most of them of a contemplative nature—six works by the Kadampa master Kyotôn Mônlam Tsültrim4 (1219-1299), The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates the System o f the Proponents o f Shentong Mad- hyamaka by the Eighth Karmapa, Mikyô Dorje5 (1507-1554), and Guiding Instructions on the View o f Great Shentong Madhyamaka by Jamgon Kong- trul Lodrô Tayé6 (1813-1899). These texts, as well as excerpts from others, provide ample scriptural support for the meditative approach to the Ut­taratantra (versus the exegetical or study approach) and also establish theXI"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xii Prefaceways in which the text is used in the context of Mahàmudrà instructions and the Shentong view.The introduction provides a survey of the main sütra sources of the tathâgatagarbha teachings and the great variety of explanations of the meaning of tathâgatagarbha in India and Tibet. It also investigates the his­tory and transmission of the five works of Maitreya from India to Tibet as well as the relationships between the Uttaratantra and Yogàcàra, Shentong, and Mahàmudrà. Several appendices contain comments by different Indian and Tibetan authors on the crucial verses 1.27-28 and 1.154-55 of the Ut­taratantra as well as Abhisamayâlamkâra V.21 (which is virtually identical with Uttaratantra 1.154), explanations of the key term “the emptiness en­dowed with all supreme aspects,” and some additional comments on the meaning and purpose of teaching tathâgatagarbha.Given this wealth of materials, it is hard to believe that the original scope of this book was actually very modest—simply translating the Uttaratantra, RGVV, and Dashi Oser s commentary, with only a very short introduction. However, in the course of this work, the discovery of CMW7 and the texts by Mônlam Tsültrim (triggered by BAs mentioning one of them),8 as well as closer looks at the above-mentioned texts by Sajjana, the Eighth Karmapa, and Jamgon Kongtrul, led to a fascinating journey. This journey included looking at the different ways in which the Maitreya texts and the Uttaratan­tra in particular were transmitted and interpreted in India and Tibet, how the Uttaratantra came to be related with Mahàmudrà in both the Kagyii and Kadampa traditions, how the Shentong view in these traditions (versus the one of Dôlpopa) is very compatible with Mahàmudrà, and how the Ut­taratantra is used as the basis of contemplative Mahàmudrà-style manuals. In particular, for many years I was always intrigued when I heard or saw “the meditative tradition of the Maitreya texts” being mentioned, but it seemed that not much information about its contents, let alone possible scriptural sources, was available. Now, this situation has definitely changed through the study, research, and translation of the above works and other materials. The rich findings on my journey through the worlds of tathâga­tagarbha, Yogàcàra, Shentong, and Mahàmudrà are presented here, and it is my hope that the reader will enjoy the many scenic outlooks on the way (externally as well as internally) as much as I did.An asterisk (*) preceding a Sanskrit term or phrase indicates the most probable Sanskrit that corresponds to a Tibetan term or phrase when the original Sanskrit is unavailable or unattested.

I am also very thankful to all the Indian, Tibetan, Bhutanese, Chinese, Japanese, Ameri­can, English, French, German, Danish, Dutch, Polish, and Russian scholars (too many to name here) who have worked on the Uttaratantra and related materials before me. Their efforts have supported me greatly in present­ing several parts of this book. As always, I am particularly appreciative of, and thankful for, the generous support by the Tsadra Foundation, which has changed my life in a profound way and has made the translations and research in this and other volumes possible. Big thanks also go to Michael Wakoff for his skilled and meticulous editing. I am also grateful to Steph­anie Johnston for preparing the layout, as well as kindly listening to the ramblings about my latest discoveries on the journey of putting together this book.If there is anything in this volume that sounds good, makes sense, and serves as an antidote to ignorance, confusion, and suffering, may it be rel­ished as originating from realized masters and scholars truly vast in learn­ing. Everything else, including all mistakes, can safely be said to be mine.It is my hope that this work may be a contributing cause for the buddha heart of His Holiness the seventeenth Gyalwang Karmapa, Ogyen Trin- ley Dorje, swiftly embracing all sentient beings in whatever ways suitable. May it in particular be of assistance in transplanting and sustaining both the scholarly and meditative traditions of the Karma Kagyii lineage in the English-speaking world, as these were initiated and fostered by all the Kar- mapas and their followers as a means to enable suffering beings to penetrate the thick clouds of their adventitious obscurations and soar freely through the sky of minds vast and luminous expanse.XIII"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Tr a n slato r’s In t r o d u c t io n"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources of the Tathagatagarbha TeachingsPossibly the first appearance of the term tathagatagarbha (though not in the sense in which it is used in the tathagatagarbha sutras) has been traced to the Mahasamghika Ekottarikagama (the Chinese recension of the Ah- guttara Nikdya):If someone devotes himself to the Ekottarikagama,Then he has the tathagatagarbha.Even if his body cannot exhaust defilements in this life,In his next life he will attain supreme wisdom.9The term is also used once in the Gandavyuhasutra (which is dated prior to the Tathagatagarbhasutra) as an epithet of Sudhana, without further expla­nation.10 Furthermore, the Prajhapdramitasutra in One Hundred Fifty Lines (Adhyardhasatikdprajhaparamitasutra) contains the sentence “all sentient beings possess the tathagata heart because their entire being is that of the great bodhisattva Samantabhadra.”11The earliest mahayana sutras that are based on and discuss the notion of tathagatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century.12 To my knowledge, there is no Indian text that provides a list of “tathagatagarbha sutras,” but the Uttaratantra and RGVV spell out their sutra sources as follows.The Uttaratantra (1.2) declares that its primary source is the Dharani- svararajasutra, which is said to contain all seven vajra points. R G W adds the following sutras as alternative individual scriptural sources for these vajra points—the Sthiradhyasayaparivartasutra (vajra points 1 to 3), the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta (vajra points 4 and 6), the Snmaladevisutra (vajra point 5), and the Tathagatagunajhandcintyavisaya- vataranirdesasutra (vajra point 7). In addition, Uttaratantra 111.27 refers to the Ratnadarikasutra as the source of the sixty-four buddha qualities. R G W also mentions the Tathagatagarbhasutra as the basis for teaching3"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4 Translators Introductionthe dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition in detail (which refers to Uttaratantra 1.143-52, matching the dharmakaya and so on with the nine examples in that sutra). Though the Sarvabuddhavisayavatara- jndndlokalamkarasutra is not explicitly mentioned in the Uttaratantra, it is clearly the source of the nine examples for enlightened activity used in the Uttaratantra. In addition, R G W quotes this sutra several times.Further important quotes in R G W related to the notion of tathaga- tagarbha are from the Buddhavatamsakasutra (the example of the universe being painted on a huge canvas and then being inserted into a minute par­ticle, which illustrates tathagata wisdom pervading the mind streams of all sentient beings), as well as the Gaganaganjapariprcchdsutra and the Saga- ramatipariprcchasutra (both about luminous mind and its adventitious stains). A famous passage from the Culasunnatasutta13 is silently incorpo­rated in RGVVs comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55. R G W also refers to the passage “those with great desire have the nature of absolutely not [attaining] parinirvana,” which is found in several sutras, among them the Mahaparinirvanasutra,14It is obvious that the Uttaratantra's nine examples for the tathagata heart being obscured by adventitious stains come from the Tathagatagarbhasutra, but neither the Uttaratantra nor R G W explicitly acknowledge this. Like­wise, the Uttaratantras example of the painters who draw a kings portrait (1.88-92), which illustrates the emptiness endowed with all supreme as­pects, is unacknowledged as stemming from the Ratnacudapariprcchasutra.Later, probably beginning with Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen15 (1292-1361), Tibetan authors began to use the terms utathagatagarbha sutras”16 and “sutras of definitive meaning” and compiled lists of those types of sutras. Dolpopas “ten tathagatagarbha sutras” consist of the following:1. Tathagatagarbhasutra2. Avikalpapravesadharam3. Srimaladevisutra4. Mahabherisutra5. Ahgulimaliyasutra6. Sunyatdnamamahasutra177.

The introduction says the following about what these twenty sùtras teach:I pay homage to and take refuge in the pure ground that is empty and devoid of the bearers of the nature of phenomena, the nature of phe­nomena, suchness, the great bliss of self-arising wisdom—the final purity, self, bliss, and permanence—that is the partless omnipresent pervader, the single blend of expanse and wisdom without any flaws of contradiction and beyond mundane examples, dependent origination, dialectics, and consciousness, the sphere of personally experienced wisdom, the ultimate sugata heart resembling the eight mirror divina­tions, the inseparability of [samsàric] existence and peace in which the many are one taste and that incorporates all ultimate buddhas, dhar- mas, samghas, deities, mantras, tantras, mandalas, and mudràs, the natural luminosity that is the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, as well as the inseparability of the two realities, and in which there is nothing to be removed or to be added, natural connateness, natural changelessness, great nirvana, great Madhyamaka, Mahàmudrà, pro­found prajùàpàramità, and the other-empty dharmakàya that pervades"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 Translators Introductionall of space.

In detail, one needs to read the entire Kangyur and Tengyur, and one definitely needs to cultivate the profound yogas.21The Gelugpa scholars Kedrub Je Geleg Balsang22 (1385-1438) and Kung- tang Goncho Denpe Dronme23 (1762-1823) present the Jonangpa list of ten tathagatagarbha sutras by replacing the Tathagatagunajhandcintyavisaya- vataranirdesasutra, Sunyatdndmamahasutra, and Mahameghasutra in Dol- popas above list with the Sarvabuddhavisaydvatdrajhandlokalamkarasutra, Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta, and Samdhinirmocanasutra.24 Tuk- wan Lobsang Chokyi Nyima25 (1737-1802) has yet another list based on Dolpopas Ocean o f Definitive Meaning,26 which consists of the following:1.

SuvarnaprabhasottamasutraThe Nyingma master Gahto Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu27 (1698-1755), an important teacher of the Jonang Shentong and Kalacakratantra traditions for the Eighth Situpa, Chokyi Jungne (1699/1700-1774), wrote a brief versified text,28 whose title says that it lists “the sutras of the heart of the definitive meaning of the final teaching cycle that ascertain the ultimate.” This list consists of “the twenty-two sutras of definitive meaning.” Among these, the “five tathagatagarbha sutras” are the following:1. Tathagatagarbhasutra2. Avikalpapravesadharani3. Srimaladevtsutra4. Mahdbherlsutra5. Ahgulimdllyasutra"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathàgatagarbha Teachings 7“The ten tathagatagarbha sutras” are the above five plus the following:6. Lahkavatarasutra7.

However, only the first five tathagatagarbha sutras are identical in name and classification in both lists, while the classifications of the remaining sutras as “tathagatagarbha sutras” or “sutras of definitive meaning” differ greatly between Dolpopa and Tsewang Norbu.30Almost exacdy the same twenty-two sutras with the same classifications are found in a collection of twenty-two sutras of definitive meaning by the Gelugpa scholar Tubten Legshe Sangpo31 (born 1835) from Drepung, who was also active at the Derge printing house.

The only two differences between Tsewang Norbus and Tub ten Legshé Sangpo’s lists are that the latter speaks of the first five sütras as “the five selected tathâgatagarbha sùtras” and that it re­places the Suvarnaprabhâsottamasùtra with “the complete elaborations on the Mahâparinirvânasütra.”32 Since some of the quite specific wordings in Tsewang Norbus text and Tub ten Legshé Sangpos colophon are identical, either the latter relied on the former or both drew from another common (but unknown) source.The Essence o f Shentong33 by Tàranàtha (1575-1634) says that Great Madhyamaka (that is, Shentong) relies on sùtras from all three dharma wheels. The sùtras from the first wheel are such as the Kaccâyanagottasutta and the Mahâsunnatâsutta. Those from the second wheel are such as the “Maitreya Chapter” and the Pahcasatikâprajhâpâramitâ. Those from the third wheel include the four sùtras of definitive meaning of Mere Mentalism:1. Samdhinirmocanasütra2. Lankâvatârasütra3. Ghanavyühasütra4.

An exhaustive study of all the details of whether, how, and to what extent the teachings on tathagatagarbha are represented in the above sutras is obviously beyond the scope of this book, so the following is just a brief survey of the major points of how buddha nature is discussed in these sutras.48The TathagatagarbhasutraThe earliest one among these sutras is the Tathagatagarbhasutra,49 which primarily consists of detailed descriptions of the nine examples for all sen­tient beings possessing the tathagata heart that are also found in the Ut- taratantra. The central and repeated message of the Tathagatagarbhasutra is that all beings bear a fully perfect buddha within themselves. However, these beings are not buddhas yet because they are not aware of the bud- dhahood that lies within them, which is obscured by the cocoons of afflic­tions and needs to be pointed out. Still, the true nature of all beings is not different from that of a buddha, and beings will manifest as buddhas once the obscuring afflictions have been removed. As Takasaki (1974) and Zim- mermann (1998) point out, this topic is closely related to, and based on, the passage in the Buddhavatamsakasutra about buddha wisdom being present in all beings50 (which precedes the Tathagatagarbhasutra and is also quoted in RGVV).51 Zimmermann (1998 and 2002) also points out some relation­ships and similarities between the Tathagatagarbhasutra and the Maha- parinirvanasutra, the Mahabherisutra, the Saddharmapundarikasutra, and the Lahkavatdrasutra (see below).The AnunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivartaAnother early tathagatagarbha sutra (and the shortest) is the Anunatva- purnatvanirdesaparivarta. It is available only in a Chinese translation,52 and almost one-third is quoted in RGVV, which clearly shows the Indian origin of this sutra. As its title suggests (parivarta means “chapter”), this sutra may originally have been part of a larger sutra or a sutra collection. It has a close thematic relationship with the Srunalddevlsutra and likewise emphasizes the importance of faith as a skillful means for the realization of the tathagata heart (though not as its actual cause). As in many other"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathâgatagarbha Teachings 13early mahàyàna sùtras, the main interlocutor in the Anünatvâpürnatva- nirdesaparivarta is Sàriputra.As its name says, the main theme of the sùtra is the discussion of the lack of increase and decrease. The text says that it is due to the misconcep­tion of there being any increase or decrease of the dhàtu of sentient beings that beings roam in samsàra and wrongly think of nirvàna as annihilation or permanence. The root of such misconceptions is their lack of under­standing the oneness of the nondual dharmadhâtu. This dharmadhâtu is the sphere and the great nirvàna of buddhas, which cannot be perceived even by sràvakas and pratyekabuddhas, let alone ordinary beings. Still, bud­dhas, bodhisattvas, and sentient beings are not different in essence since they are nothing but three different states of the dharmakàya in terms of its being more or less unobscured by adventitious stains. The dhàtu of sentient beings is ultimate reality and the tathàgata heart, which is also identified as the dharmakàya, fully endowed with the inseparable, innumerable, and inconceivable qualities of a buddha, just as the radiance, color, and shape of a jewel are inseparable. The three states of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and sentient beings are nondual, being neither the same nor different.Tathâgatagarbha is primordially connected by nature with the incon­ceivable qualities and wisdoms of a buddha. For the sake of sentient be­ings, this is described as the naturally pure mind. Also, the tathàgata heart is by nature not connected with the cocoons of the afflictions, which are eliminated only through the awakened wisdom of a tathàgata. For the sake of sentient beings, it is described as the naturally pure mind being tainted by adventitious stains. The tathâgatagarbha as the nature of phenomena remains the same and is permanent until the end of time. It is the ground of all phenomena but is itself without arising and ceasing, and represents the permanent, eternal, everlasting, and peaceful refuge that is the incon­ceivable and pure dharmadhâtu (that is, the dharmakàya). Thus, ultimately, sentient beings are without arising and ceasing, as well as endowed with all the qualities of the dharmadhâtu. The realization that buddhas, bodhisat­tvas, and sentient beings are not different in their essence is thus free from the two wrong views of increase and decrease. Thus, when the dharmakàya is obscured by adventitious stains, it is called “sentient being.” When this very same dharmakàya becomes weary of samsàra and practices the ten pàramitàs and bodhisattva conduct, it is called “bodhisattva.” When it is free from all stains, it is called “buddha.”As Jikido Takasaki, Diana M. Paul, and Henry Shiu point out, there are a number of common features between the Tathâgatagarbhasütra and the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14 Translators IntroductionAnunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta, such as tathagatagarbha's being asso­ciated with sentient beings, its embodying the nature and wisdom of a bud­dha, its being obscured by adventitious stains, and sentient beings’ not being aware of its presence within them. Of course, all these features are also shared with other tathagatagarbha sutras. Shiu adds that the Mahaparinir- vanasutra and the AhgulimaliyasutradiXe also closely related to th eAnunatva- purnatvanirdesaparivarta in their presentations of tathagatagarbha.The SnmaladevisutraThe Srimaladevisutras3 shares even more ideas with the Anunatvapurnat- vanirdesaparivarta and explains them in greater detail (it even contains some almost identical passages). Just as the Saddharmapundarikasutra and other sutras, the Snmaladevisutra speaks of the single yana (the bud- dhayana) and links this notion to tathagatagarbha. Like the Anunatva- purnatvanirdesaparivartay it speaks of the dharmakaya as “the permanent and everlasting refuge” and also takes the tathagatagarbha to be the basis of both samsara and nirvana. Both sutras use the same terms to describe the dharmakaya—“permanent,” “eternal,” “everlasting,” and “peaceful,” which also appear repeatedly as typical terms in the Uttaratantra and R G W . Furthermore, both sutras speak of the inseparable and inconceiv­able buddha qualities of the tathagata heart that cannot be realized as being divisible from it and far surpass the sand grains in the river Ganga in num­ber. They also equate tathagatagarbha with the dharmakaya obscured by stains and say that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot realize tathaga- tagarbha. However, the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta's discussion of “those with great desire” (icchantika),54 who cling to the dharmakaya and the dhatu of sentient beings as being different, is not mentioned in the Snmaladevisutra.Further crucial notions in the tathagatagarbha teachings found in the Snmaladevisutra include linking tathagatagarbha with emptiness in a par­ticular twofold way—the tathagata heart (or naturally luminous mind) is empty of adventitious stains but not empty of its limitless inseparable qual­ities. This is said to be the correct understanding of emptiness, and to under­stand tathagatagarbha means to understand emptiness. Those who cling to everything’s being purely empty are those whose minds are distracted from emptiness’s being understood in a proper manner (sunyataviksiptacitta).55 Also, the sutra speaks of the fruition of tathagatagarbha being the dharma­kaya that consists of the four paramitas of purity, self, bliss, and perma­nence.56 Furthermore, the crucial notion of “the ground of the latent"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Sutra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 15tendencies of ignorance” as the basis and sum of all obscurations of the tathagata heart is used several times in the sutra. Besides all these elements also being found in the Uttaratantra and RGW , the general outstanding significance of the Srimaladevisutra for the teachings on buddha nature is highlighted by the fact that it is the sutra with by far the greatest number of quotes and references in R G W (cited twenty-eight times).The DharanisvararajasutraGiven that the Uttaratantra identifies the Dharanisvarardjasutra57 as its main source, it is quite surprising that this sutra never even mentions terms such as tathagatagarbha or buddhadhatu. It contains, however, the term “disposition/lineage of the three jewels” (Tib. dkon mchoggsum gyi rigs) six times.58 Of course, the Tibetan would fit very well with the term ratnago- tra in Ratnagotravibhaga. However, dkon mchoggsum gyi rigs renders both triratnavamsa and ratnatrayagotra (or triratnagotra), and a quote from the Dharanisvarardjasutra in R G W has triratnavamsa59 The term is used in a uniform manner in the sutra (“not interrupting the lineage of the three jewels”), paralleling the notion of bodhisattvas “not interrupting the bud­dha lineage (buddhavamsa)” in texts such as the Sdgaramatipariprcchasutra and the Kasyapaparivarta (see below), which does not suggest the typical notion of buddha nature. Given this uniform use in the Dharanisvarard- jasutra, it is to be assumed that the remaining occurrences of dkon mchog gsumgyi rigs in this sutra also render triratnavamsa and not ratnatrayagotra (which is found in the text of R G W proper). Thus, tempting as it may be, the assumption that the Dharanisvarardjasutra gave the Ratnagotravibhaga its name is very unlikely.60The sutra also speaks several times of “the dhatu (or basic element) of sentient beings,” adding sometimes that it is impure, not stainless, and associated with afflictions or flaws. It also classifies this dhatu of sentient beings as threefold—“being certain in terms of what is correct,” “being un­certain,” and “being certain in terms of what is mistaken” (all of this is also found in the Uttaratantra and RG W ). In particular, the sutra states several times that the Buddha looks at the impure dhatus of sentient beings and then guides those who are suitable through his enlightened activity.However, when investigating the extensive passages from the intro­duction and the beginning of the main part of this sutra that R G W and Tibetan commentaries (such as CMW) identify as the sources of the Ut- taratantras seven vajra points, one does not find much that corresponds"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"16 Translators Introductionto the distinct terminologies and concepts through which the Uttaratantra explains these vajra points.In terms of the first three vajra points, the sütra speaks about the con­summate causes of the three jewels and their infinite and unsurpassable qualities in great detail but not in the way the Uttaratantra describes the ultimate qualities of the three jewels.The fourth vajra point—the tathàgata heart—is said by RGVV to be ex­plained by the sixty factors of purification in the Dhâranîsvararâjasütra. However, even according to R G W itself, those factors teach the tathàgata heart only by implication:The buddha element is explained through a description of the sixty kinds of factors that purify its [natural] purity because it is [only] if the object to be purified is endowed with qualities that purifications of its purity are justified.Indeed, the passages in the sütra about these factors of purification contain nothing about the tathàgata heart but only describe the four or­naments, eight illuminations, sixteen kinds of compassion, and thirty-two kinds of activities of bodhisattvas.The fifth through seventh vajra points—awakening, its qualities, and its enlightened activity—are said by R G W to be taught by the sütras pas­sages on the eighty divisions of the attributes of the victors. Among these, awakening is explained through the sixteen great aspects of awakening, due to which sixteen corresponding forms of great compassion engage those who have not attained awakening. The qualities of awakening are taught as consisting of the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique buddha qualities (this seems to be the only part of the Dhâranï- svararâjasütra that actually matches one part in the Uttaratantras explana­tion of its vajra points).61 The sütra contains no separate discussion of the thirty-two kinds of enlightened activities other than explaining that each of the above thirty-two qualities performs a certain activity that accords with this quality (thus, these thirty-two qualities include the thirty-two kinds of enlightened activities). In addition, this section in the sütra is followed by a further general discussion of buddha activity.It is this last section that contains the famous example of purifying an encrusted beryl in three stages, which is also quoted in RGVV. It is only here that we find a discussion of the impure dhàtu (or basic element) in all sentient beings’ being likewise purified in three steps through the Buddha s"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathâgatagarbha Teachings 17first teaching on impermanence, suffering, identitylessness, and impurity, secondly teaching on emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, and finally teaching on the complete purity of the three spheres,62 which eventually makes sentient beings enter the domain of the tathàgatas.63The MahâparinirvânasütraFirst of all, there are two types of sütras with the name Mahâparinir­vânasütra, whose main topic consists of the events surrounding the last days of the Buddha. The earlier version of this sütra, which is contained in the Pali canon (there are also Sanskrit and Chinese versions),64 is a com­prehensive compendium of hlnayàna ideas. The later version,65 which is discussed here, also contains some of the well-known episodes toward the end of the Buddha s life but treats them mainly as convenient starting points for the discussion of mahàyàna ideas, such as mahâparinirvânas actually referring to the permanent and blissful nature of the dharmakàya and buddha natures being universally present in all sentient beings. This sütras presentation of buddha nature became the main scriptural basis for the discussion of tathâgatagarbha in China.The Mahâparinirvânasütra equates the term tathâgatagarbha with “bud­dha element” (buddhadhâtu; the same is done in the Angulimâlïyasütra, Mahâbherïsütra, Uttaratantra, and RGVV) as well as with the single yàna, and says that buddha nature is an equivalent of buddhahood or perfect awakening. Buddha nature is eternal, pure, real, virtuous, and will be re­alized by everyone in the future. Similar to the Srïmâlâdevïsütra, this re­sultant buddha nature—the dharmakàya—is said to consist of the four pàramitàs of permanence, bliss, purity, and a self. Buddha nature itself is also equated with the notion of a self, but there is a clear warning of con­fusing this “correct” self with the notion of âtman in its ordinary sense. Furthermore, buddha nature as a result (buddhahood) is endowed with a perfect buddhas ten powers, four fearlessnesses, eighteen unique qualities, major and minor marks, and so on. What it lacks or is free from are all kinds of karmas and their results, afflictions, the skandhas, and the twelve links of dependent origination.66In this sütra, the statement “all sentient beings possess buddha nature” is repeatedly explained to mean that they will possess perfect awakening in the future but do not possess the major and minor marks of a buddha right now. In order for this awakening to happen, sentient beings (the direct or primary cause) must practice the six pàramitàs (the auxiliary causes), just as milk is made into cream or butter through additional other conditions."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"18 Translator s IntroductionConsequently, the sutra vehemently criticizes people who misinterpret the teachings on buddha nature to mean that all beings have already attained buddhahood and that there is thus no need for the practices of a bodhi- sattva. Rather, beings can perceive their buddha nature only if they make efforts in the Buddhist path. The sutra even says that if one regards the expression “possessing buddha nature” to mean “possessing it at present,” it must then be said that sentient beings do not possess buddha nature. That buddha nature is both nonexistent at present and existent in the future is presented as an expression of the Buddhist middle path. Similarly, the sutra says that if one sees everything to be empty but fails to see what is not empty, this is not called “the middle path.” Likewise, if one sees everything as the lack of a self but fails to see what is the self, this is not called “the middle path.” What is called “the middle path” is the buddha element (that is, tathagatagarbha).In the same vein, the sutra also frequently refers to the tathagata heart as being a seed and illustrates it through the examples of flowers’ growing out of elephant tusks when it rains and butters being made from milk. In those cases, buddha nature is obviously regarded as a potential that becomes fully developed only later.On the other hand, the sutras examples of a pearl embedded in the fore­head of a strong man, a treasure beneath the earth, and a gold mine suggest that buddha nature is immanent in sentient beings and only needs to be re­vealed. The Mahaparinirvanasutra explicidy refers to the Tathagatagarbha- sittra and attributes the statement that the buddhadhatu is present in all sentient beings to this sutra (this could also mean that the examples of a hidden treasure and a gold mine, though different in details, may have been inspired by the similar examples in the Tathagatagarbhasutra). In that vein, the sutra also states that buddha nature is not newly created but only pre­vented from being seen by adventitious stains. Furthermore, the text says, just as an empty bottle is empty only of liquid but not of its own color and shape, liberation is empty only of afflictions and suffering but is not empty in the sense of being nonexistent. By contrast, the sutra declares elsewhere that buddha nature abides nowhere and thus is also not in sentient beings, just as sound does not abide in any part of a lute.In sum, the Mahaparinirvanasutra discusses three very different mean­ings of all sentient beings’ possessing buddha nature—(1) all are endowed with an intrinsic pure nature of which they will become fully aware once what obscures it has been removed, (2) all possess a seed or potential for buddhahood, which will grow into its full fruition in the future once all"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 19necessary conditions are present, and (3) the mahayana path to buddha- hood is open for all, and its result is definite if one follows this path.Among these three positions, the third is probably the one that has the most support in this sutra for several reasons. The sutra repeatedly encour­ages its audience to avoid metaphysical speculations as in (1) and (2) and to focus on the practices that actually lead to buddhahood. Also, it contains several passages that strongly deny buddha nature to be an entity that is inherent in sentient beings, such as, “If some hold that all sentient beings definitely possess the tathagata heart, which is permanent, blissful, a self, and pure, and that it is neither produced nor born but is not perceived by sentient beings due to the existence of stains, it should be understood that they slander the Buddha, the dharma, and the samgha.” Besides the above example of the lute, the sutra contains further passages that greatly oppose the notion of future buddhahoods being based on some dormant potential that exists at present, such as saying that if milk already had the nature of butter, it would not need any other conditions to become butter. Likewise, sentient beings are said not to have the nature of buddhas intrinsically but need to rely on the conditions of practicing the paramitas and so on. In addition, ultimately, no phenomenon has any definite nature whatsoever. Furthermore, the sutra explains that sentient beings are said to possess bud­dha nature in contrast to inanimate things because they, unlike stones and so on, are able to attain buddhahood. In general, the sutra often emphasizes the practical implications of the teachings on buddha nature, such as its being praised by bodhisattvas in order to encourage sentient beings to give rise to bodhicitta. The Buddha also says that buddha nature is in fact not a self but is only described as a self for the sake of guiding certain beings.The Mahdparinirvanasutras position on the notion of “those with great desire” (icchantika) is as ambiguous as its position on buddha nature. “Those with great desire” are consistently portrayed in this sutra as possess­ing all the major flaws described in Buddhism (such as enjoying evil deeds, putting down the mahayana dharma, and committing the five actions of immediate consequence),67 and they are said to be incurable. Consequently, the first part of the sutra denies that those with great desire, who are like a scorched seed, possess buddha nature and that they ever attain buddha­hood (which of course stands in direct opposition to the sutras passages that state that all sentient beings possess buddha nature). By contrast, later passages affirm that those with great desire possess buddha nature, can definitely attain buddhahood, and only temporarily lack roots of virtue.68 Despite these extensive discussions of the notion of icchantika, the sutra"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"20 Translators Introductionnever uses the terms “disposition” (gotra) or “those who lack the disposi­tion” (agotraka).In sum, these very different and even contradictory positions on buddha nature and the notion of icchantika in the same sutra suggest that the ver­sions of this sutra that we have now were compiled from different sources (as is the case with other mahayana sutras, such as the Lahkavatdrasutra).The AngulimaliyasutraLike the Mahaparinirvanasutra, the Angulimaliyasutra69 is a mahayana ver­sion of an earlier Nikaya sutra with the same name,70 and it also stresses the ethical and practical aspects of the tathagatagarbha teachings. For example, the sutra says that practitioners keep proper Buddhist discipline and so on because they possess buddha nature.The sutra centers around the ex-serial killer Angulimala, whose guru had told him to kill one thousand people and collect a finger from each one, which he wore as a necklace (thus his name “Finger-Necklace”). After having murdered 999 persons, he met the Buddha and intended to make him his last victim. However, despite his running as fast as he could, he could not reach the Buddha, who kept walking at normal speed. After a brief conversation, he became the Buddhas student and quickly attained arhathood. As one of its highlights, the sutra contains a debate between the arhat Angulimala and Manjusrl (who defends the emptiness of the pra- jnaparamita sutras) on the correct understanding of emptiness, nirvana, tathagatagarbha, and the dharmakaya, which clearly favors the superior­ity of emptiness as having the meaning of tathagatagarbha and buddha- hood’s being empty only of stains but not in every respect (of course, this is reminiscent of Tibetan debates about Rangtong and Shentong). The de­bate culminates in Manjusri’s encouraging Angulimala to meditate on the great emptiness of all phenomena that is nothing whatsoever.71 Angulimala asks Manjusrl what the meaning of always saying “empty, empty” is, which Manjusrl answers with a verse about all phenomena’s, including the kayas and wisdoms of the Buddha, being like space, without characteristics, un- graspable, and formless. Angulimala replies as follows:Childish beings may think of hailstones as being gems and take them home, but then they see them melt and think, “Oh, they are empty.” Likewise, through reflecting and meditating on utter emptiness, you, Manjusrl, see all phenomena dissolve. You even think that liberation, which is not empty, is empty. Just as some people may meditate on gems"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathâgatagarbha Teachings 21as being empty due to their mistaking hailstones for gems and seeing those hailstones melt away, you even think of nonempty phenomena as being empty. Seeing phenomena as empty, you also destroy nonempty phenomena as being empty. However, empty phenomena are different from nonempty phenomena. Just like hailstones, the billions of afflic­tions are empty. Just like hailstones, nonvirtuous phenomena swiftly perish. But the Buddha and liberation are permanent, like a beryl. As for space, buddhas have form, while all srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas lack form. The liberation of a buddha is also form, while the liberations of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas lack form, so how can you say that the characteristic of liberation is to be empty? Do not entertain this notion of there being no [such] divisions.If there are no people in a house, it is empty. If there is no water in a vase, it is empty. If no water flows in a river, it is empty. The house is not empty in all respects—it is called “empty” because there are no people in it. The vase is not empty in all respects—it is called “empty” because there is no water in it. The river is not empty in all respects—it is called “empty” because no water flows in it. Likewise, liberation is not empty in all respects—it is called “empty” because it is free from all flaws. The Buddha is not empty either—he is called empty because he is free from all flaws and lacks any human or divine existence entail­ing billions of afflictions. Alas, Mañjusrl, you behave like a mosquito, not understanding the precise meaning of empty and nonempty. The Nirgranthas72 also meditate on everything’s being empty, so you Nir- grantha mosquito, say no more!73Prior to this debate, the Buddha answers the classical question why all sentient beings are not enlightened, if they all possess the tathàgata heart. He says that even if all buddhas searched with great effort, they would never find any stains in the tathàgata heart, and this stainless tathàgata heart adorned with infinite major and minor marks exists in all sentient beings.74 The tathàgata heart is covered by billions of afflictions and thus is invisible, like oil in a thorough mix of oil and lots of water. However, just like oil and water, there is no chance for the buddha element and these afflictions ever becoming blended into one. Though the former abides within the latter, it is like a lamp in a vase—once the vase is broken, the lamp shines brightly and beautifully. Or, the srâvakas of the buddha are like the vase and their lack of afflictions is like the lamp. Once the billions of afflictions break like the vase through engaging in the path to liberation, the entire dharmadhâtu"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"22 Translators Introductionis eventually seen like a myrobalan fruit in the palm of ones hand.75 Also, when the sun and moon are covered by clouds, they do not shine on the earth, but they do shine once they are freed from clouds. Likewise, if the tathagata heart is covered by the billions of afflictions, it does not shine, but the sun or moon of the buddha element shines once it is liberated from these afflictions. Anybody who teaches the tathagata heart is called “a perfect buddha,” no matter whether they possess afflictions or are free from them.Similar to the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta and also echoing the Snmaladevisutra, the Ahgulimaliyasutra says that the inconceivable pure dharmadhatu is the ultimate single refuge that is unborn, unceasing, per­manent, eternal, everlasting, and peaceful, that there is only a single yana (the one that leads to the realization of the tathagata heart), and that the tathagata heart is nothing but the natural purity of the mind. The afflictions are said to arise from not knowing this natural purity of the mind (just as the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta says that all wrong views, afflictions, and so on, arise from not knowing the single dhatu). The Ahgulimaliyasutra likewise identifies the dhatu (or basic element) of sentient beings with this single dhatu and, similar to the Mahdparinirvanasutray moreover equates both with the “dhatu that is the self’ (atmadhatu), which is in turn closely related to the paramita of self as found in both the Mahdparinirvanasutra and the Snmaladevisutra. Also, the Ahgulimaliyasutra explicitly draws at­tention to the significance of the tathagatagarbha sutras and the need to appreciate them properly.The Ahgulimaliyasutra even quotes the famous second verse of the Dhammapada and says that this verse intends the meaning of tathagatagar- bha to be nothing but the natural purity of the mind:Mind precedes phenomena,Mind is their chief, from mind they spring.Those who speak or act with a pure mindHappiness will follow like their shadow.What distinguishes the Ahgulimaliyasutra from other tathagatagarbha sutras are its detailed discussions (usually in the form of dialogues) of the correct and incorrect views on tathagatagarbha, emptiness, nirvana, and the dharmakaya, which progressively guide the reader up to the ultimate view through gradually clarifying different levels of misunderstanding.Given the obvious importance of the Ahgulimaliyasutra for the tathdga- tagarbha teachings and its (in all probability) availability prior to the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Sutra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 23Uttaratantra and RGW , it is very surprising that it is not mentioned in either the Uttaratantra or R G W (or in any of the other commentaries in this volume except for a few references in GC and its merely being listed as a tathagatagarbha sütra in JKC).The MahàbherïsütraSimilar to some of the above sütras, this text also states that the Buddha as well as the tathàgata heart are permanent, eternal, everlasting, peaceful, and a self.76 Srâvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have newly entered the mahayana are incapable of realizing the parinirvàna of the buddhas as permanent, eternal, everlasting, and peaceful. It is only bodhi- sattva mahàsattvas who understand the eternal character of the Tathàgata as well as the existence of the tathàgata heart, without abandoning the two­fold identitylessness of persons and phenomena. Those bodhisattvas are able to distinguish teachings of expedient meaning and definitive mean­ing. Among other positive activities, they will preserve the tathagatagarbha sütras and teach their benefit.Similar to the Mahaparinirvanasutra, the Mahàbherïsütra uses the ex­ample of the progressive refinement of milk into butter and ghee (clarified butter) for the progressive manifestation of the pure essence of buddha nature. Ordinary beings with wrong views are said to be like an impure mixture of milk and blood, while those who have taken refuge in the three jewels resemble pure milk. Those who pursue the dharma out of faith and new bodhisattvas are similar to cream. Srâvakas and bodhisattvas on the first seven bhümis are like fresh butter. Sràvaka and pratyekabuddhas ar- hats as well as bodhisattvas on the ninth and tenth bhümis resemble melted butter, while tathàgatas are similar to ghee.In this sütra, the Buddha uses the terms tathagatagarbha, tathâgatadhàtu, and buddhadhâtu interchangeably. He also links tathagatagarbha, which is said to be infinitely luminous and pure, with the notions of the single dhàtu and the single yàna. The wisdoms of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas as well as the sütras on emptiness are like a city conjured up by the leader of a travel party for the weary travelers to rest for a while, whereas buddhahood resembles the actual final destination of this party, a marvelous and real huge city with a great abundance of everything. Thus, the teachings on the three yànas and the three nirvànas are of expedient meaning and have only a temporary purpose. The Buddha even proclaims that those who say that sütras such as the Mahàbherïsütra do not exist are not his students and he is not their teacher."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24 Translators IntroductionAny sütras that teach on emptiness should be understood to entail a cer­tain intention behind them, whereas unsurpassable sütras like the Mahâ- bherisütra do not bear any intention behind them. Those who are lazy, have corrupt discipline, and whose body, speech, and mind are not under control will cast away the sütras that teach on the permanence of the Buddha and the tathàgata heart and will instead train in the sütras on emptiness. Similar to Angulimàla above, the Buddha also says that the sütras on emptiness are only of expedient meaning and that those who do not understand the meaning of emptiness and identitylessness properly are ruined. For empti­ness and identitylessness apply only to the obscuring afflictions, while their basis—great nirvàna—is eternal and peaceful.77 Furthermore, according to the Buddha, he teaches the notion of no-self only in order to overcome the worldly notion of a self. The notion of no-self amazes people and so they become curious to hear the dharma. Once they have entered the teachings and their faith has grown, they diligently train in the dharma of emptiness. Thereafter, the Buddha says, I teach them that liberation is existent, eternal, peaceful, and has form. The existence of such liberation shows that there exists the true self—the tathàgata heart—in sentient beings, just as smoke shows the existence of fire. However, this true self, which is like gold cov­ered by ore,78 or a precious jewel inside a mountain, is not like the worldly views about a self, or like any views about permanence and extinction.In answer to Kàsyapa s question, “If there is such a true self, why is it not seen?” the Buddha teaches four examples as reasons for the existence of the tathàgata heart in all sentient beings and its being obscured only by adventitious stains.79 This tathàgata heart, he says, is adorned with in­finite major and minor marks, and through it, sentient beings will attain nirvàna. For example, a film over our eyes makes us blind for as long as we do not obtain some medicine, but we will regain our eyesight once we have taken that medicine. Likewise, the cocoon of billions of afflictions covers the basic element of beings, which is like an eye. It is not seen by srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas but only by those who delight in the Buddha. The remaining three examples are the moon covered by clouds, someones dig­ging a well and eventually finding water under many layers of earth, and a lamp within a vase. Just as this lamp, the tathàgata heart within the vase of samsàric afflictions does not shine upon and promote the welfare of beings until this vase of samsàra is broken."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 25The LankavatarasutraIt seems that most modern scholars agree that this sutra originated later than the Uttaratantra and RGW , which would explain why it is not quoted 01* referred to in these texts.80 This may be supported by the date 420 ce of the earliest Chinese translation of the sutra (which is now lost) as well as its not being explicitly quoted by name in Indian texts before the time of Sthiramati and Dharmapala (if one disregards the attribution of the Sutrasamuccaya to Nagarjuna, which contains four quotes from the Lahka- vatarasutra, mentioning it by name). On the other hand, Lindtner (1992) pointed out a number of close textual relationships between this sutra and early Madhyamaka texts by Nagarjuna and Aryadeva. In any case, that this sutra is not mentioned in the Uttaratantra and R G W81 is not necessarily due to its possible later origin. Its equation of tathagatagarbha with emp­tiness and the alaya-consciousness, as well as its statement that tathagata- garbha is taught only for the sake of removing fear of emptiness and attract­ing non-Buddhists, clearly do not accord with the position of the Uttara­tantra and R G W and are reason enough for these texts not to refer to it. This very issue also seems to be responsible for the Lahkdvatarasutras not being included in any of the above lists of tathagatagarbha sutras despite its detailed discussions of the notion of tathagatagarbha.The entire Lankavatarasutra consists of a dialogue between the Buddha and the bodhisattva Mahamati. Though this sutra is not mentioned in the Uttaratantra, RGW , or the above lists of tathagatagarbha sutras (except for Miphams Synopsis, but only in a very limited sense), it discusses the teachings on tathagatagarbha in great detail. However, in accordance with its generally heterogeneous nature of saying different things in different places, the Lankavatarasutra uses the term tathagatagarbha in a number of very different ways. For example, the text speaks several times of tathaga- tagarbha as being the sphere of the personally experienced wisdom of the noble ones. Tathagatagarbha is also equated with suchness and the perfect nature (parinispanna):Mahamati, what is the perfect nature here? It is as follows. It is the sphere of the personally experienced wisdom of the noble ones, the attainment of the realization of suchness by the wisdom of the noble ones, which is free from conceptions about the characteristics of causal features, names, and entities. Mahamati, the perfect nature is the very heart of the tathagata heart.82"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"26 Translators IntroductionThe tenth chapter equates tathagatagarbha with naturally luminous mind and, similar to the Tathagatagarbhasutra, uses the examples of gold in gold ore and a stained cloth for the tathagata heart’s being obscured by adventitious stains. Like most of the above sutras, it even equates tathaga- tagarbha with the true self, which is clearly distinguished from the self of the tlrthikas and even outshines the lack of self:The dialecticians who are confused in the thicket Of consciousness, lack the proper doctrine,And wish to propound a self Just keep running here and there.The self to be realized in one’s personal experience Has the characteristic of purity.This tathagata heartIs not the sphere of dialecticians.The alaya that is held to be like this heart Is described by the tlrthikas As being associated with a self,But that is not what the dharmas [of the buddhas] proclaim.Through distinguishing these [two selves],Liberation and reality are seenAnd the afflictions to be relinquishedThrough seeing and familiarization are purified.Naturally luminous mind Is the pure tathagata heart,But this appropriation of sentient beings Is free from limit and nonlimit.The color of gold and the pure gold In gravel become visible Through cleansing it—so it is with the alaya Of the skandhas in a sentient being.83Buddha is neither a personNor the skandhas but uncontaminated wisdom."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Sü tra Sources of the Tathâgatagarbha Teachings 27Having familiarized with it, it is always peacefulness—In it, I take my refuge.That minds natural luminosity Is associated with mentation and so on,Afflictions, and a selfIs what the supreme speaker has taught.The naturally luminous self Is afflicted by beginningless Adventitious afflictions and is purified Like a garment [from the dirt it] possesses.Just as a garment becoming stainless And gold becoming free from flaws Remain and are not destroyed,So this self is without any flaws.84The verses that follow these provide a number of examples for this tathàgata heart—the true self as opposed to the mistaken notion of a personal self— not being seen in the skandhas by the ignorant (similar to a womans not seeing her own womb, jewels in the earth, or the healing essence of a me­dicinal plant). This passage of the sütra concludes with praising the true self and strongly criticizing the view that there is no such self:If the self does not exist, there are no Bhümis, masteries, supernatural knowledges,No unsurpassable empowerments,And no special samàdhis.Unspeakable are those who speak of the lack of the self—They separate themselves from the activities of bhiksus,Harm the dharmas of the Buddha,And entertain views about existence and nonexistence.This pronouncement of the self blazes Like the fire at the end of time,Consumes the jungle of the lack of the self,And is liberated from the flaws of the tlrthikas.85"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"28 Translators IntroductionIn that vein and similar to the Snmaladevisutra, the Lahkavatarasutra also uses the distinct term “a mind distracted from/by emptiness” (sunyatdviksiptamati):Mahamati, it is the tathagata heart, which is the cause of nirvana, hap­piness, and suffering, that circles in samsara. Naive ordinary beings whose minds are distracted by emptiness do not understand this.86The sutra also says that tathagatagarbha is the primordially pure lumi­nosity that possesses all the major marks of a buddha and always dwells immutably within all sentient beings, similar to a gem wrapped in a dirty cloth:Then, the bodhisattva mahasattva Mahamati said the following to the Bhagavan: “The Bhagavan taught the tathagata heart in the discourses of the sutra collection. You stated that, by virtue of the purity of nat­ural luminosity, it is primordially pure, endowed with the thirty-two major marks, and hidden within the bodies of all sentient beings. The Bhagavan declared that, just like a gem of great value wrapped in a stained cloth, it is wrapped up in the cloth of the skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas, is tainted by the stains of desire, hatred, ignorance, and false imagination87 [but] is permanent, eternal, peaceful, and everlasting.”88The Lahkavatarasutra uses several synonyms for tathagatagarbha, such as “buddha disposition” and “tathagata disposition.” This disposition is de­scribed as not only being free from all eight consciousnesses but also free from the essential teachings to be cultivated on the path, such as the three natures and twofold identitylessness. At the same time, it is adorned with all kinds of qualities, such as supernatural knowledges, samadhis, and powers:Mind, twofold identitylessness,Mentation, consciousness,The [three] natures, and the five dharmas89 Do not exist in my disposition.What is free from the characteristics of mind,Without consciousness and mentation,And lacks the dharmas and natures Is the tathagata disposition."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathâgatagarbha Teachings 29What is adorned by supernatural knowledges,Faculties, sam àdhis, and powersAnd endowed with all kinds of mental bodiesIs the pure tathàgata disposition.Stainless personal experience And free from causal features—The eighth bhümi and the buddhabhûmi Are the tathàgata disposition.90Likewise, the ninth and tenth bhümis are also said to represent the tathàgata disposition.91 In addition, the Laùkâvatârasütra clearly and repeatedly af­firms that there is only a single yàna—the one to buddhahood. Obviously, all of this is very much in line with what other tathâgatagarbha sùtras teach and also resembles the examples used in the Tathâgatagarbhasütra.On the other hand, the Buddha explicitly states in the Laùkâvatârasütra that what all sùtras of all buddhas teach is nothing but emptiness, nonar­ising, nonduality, and the lack of nature.92 In addition, the sútra often discusses these topics as well as the notion of identitylessness in detail. Clearly, this does not accord with the above passages in the same sútra, or with statements in other tathâgatagarbha sùtras. It corresponds rather to the well-known passages in the Samâdhirâjasütra and the Aksayamati- nirdesasütra about which sùtras are of definitive meaning, namely, those that teach emptiness and its equivalents,93 which were followed by all Màdhya- mikas. Given this discrepancy, Mahàmati of course asks how the Buddhas above teachings on tathâgatagarbha (which is even explicitly called “the self’) are different from the âtman of the Hindus:In that case, Bhagavan, isn’t the doctrine of the tathàgata heart similar to the doctrine of the self of the tlrthikas? Bhagavan, the tlrthikas too teach the doctrine of the self, which is a permanent creator, without qualities, all-pervasive, and imperishable.94In his answer, the Buddha declares that tathâgatagarbha is not like the âtman and that it actually is another word for emptiness. It was taught for the sake of preventing fear of emptiness in certain people and as a means to expediently guide non-Buddhists into the Buddhist teachings:"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"30 Translators IntroductionThe Bhagavàn said, “Mahamati, my instruction on the tathàgata heart is not similar to the doctrine of the self of the tlrthikas. Rather, Mahàmati, the tathàgatas give the instruction on the tathàgata heart as bearing the meaning of words such as emptiness, true end, nirvàna, nonarising, signlessness, and wishlessness.95 Thus, for the sake of re­linquishing what makes naive beings afraid of the lack of a self, the tathàgata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, teach the sphere of nonconceptuality and nonappearance through the introductory in­struction on the tathàgata heart.Now, Mahàmati, future and present bodhisattva mahàsattvas should not cling to the self. Mahàmati, a potter makes various con­tainers from a single lump of clay of one sort with his hands, artistic skill, a stick, water, and a rope. Mahàmati, likewise, through all kinds of forms of prajñá and skill in means, the tathàgatas [teach] phenom­enal identitylessness, in which all characteristics of conceptions have terminated, either through the instruction on the [tathàgata] heart or through the instruction on identitylessness. Just like a potter, they teach it through all kinds of words, expressions, and synonyms. For that rea­son, Mahàmati, the instruction on the tathàgata heart is not the same as the instruction on the doctrine of the self of the tlrthikas.Thus, Mahàmati, the tathàgatas teach the instruction on the tathàgata heart through teaching the tathàgata heart in order to at­tract the tlrthikas, who cling to the doctrine of the self. So how may those whose thinking falls into the views of conceiving an incorrect self and those who succumb to falling into the sphere of three [kinds of] liberation96 swiftly awaken to unsurpassable and completely per­fect awakening? Mahàmati, it is for their sake that the tathàgata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, give the instruction on the tathàgata heart. Therefore, this is not similar to the doctrine of a self of the tlrthi­kas. Consequently, in order to put an end to the views of the tlrthikas, they need to become followers of the heart of nonself of a tathàgata ( ta th àga tan ai râ tmyaga rbha). ”97Thus, here the Laûkâvatârasütra seems to present the teachings on tathagatagarbha as a provisional means, while in reality tathagatagarbha means nothing other than emptiness and identitylessness. Though other tathagatagarbha sütras such as the Srïmâlâdevïsütra and the Mahâpari- nirvánasütra also say that buddha nature should not be mistaken for the âtm an, the thrust of their statements appears to be completely different"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 31from what is said here. For both these sutras teach that the characteristic or paramita of self is a true feature or equivalent of the tathagata heart, and the Mahdparinirvanasutra even says that the lack of a self or identi­tylessness is merely a means to refute the tlrthikas. The Lahkavatarasutra here seems to proclaim the reverse—the teachings on buddha nature are a means to alleviate the fear of emptiness found in non-Buddhists and to indirectly introduce them to the definitive meaning that is emptiness and the lack of a self. Obviously, these statements played a significant role for the later reception of the buddha nature teaching in India, such as its in­tegration as a provisional instruction into the Madhyamaka tradition. This provided a basis for Indian and Tibetan Madhyamaka interpretations that the tathagatagarbha teachings are of expedient meaning.However, this section in the Lahkavatarasutra must be read in conjunc­tion with the sutras above strong statements about the tathagata hearts being the true self (as opposed to the wrong notion of a self entertained by the tlrthikas), which can be realized only by “those whose minds are not distracted by emptiness” (that is, by a nihilistic misunderstanding of emp­tiness rather than understanding the true emptiness that is the tathagata heart) and those who do not hold the view of the lack of such a self. It is also highly significant that the above section says that “all characteris­tics of conceptions have terminated, either through the instruction on the [tathagata] heart or through the instruction on identitylessness,” which clearly shows that the instruction on tathagatagarbha is naturally under­stood as an approach that is as nonreifying as the instruction on identi­tylessness or emptiness. Equally significant in that regard is the use of the term “the heart of nonself of a tathagata,” which explicitly combines or unites both notions. In addition, the Lahkavatarasutms passage below that summarizes its approach to tathagatagarbha says that it is the object of the tathagatas and was explained for Srlmaladevi in order to teach phenomenal identitylessness to the sravakas. However, in itself, it is not the object of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and tlrthikas, who cling to the teachings in a literal manner, but the object only of great bodhisattvas with subtle and sharp intelligence, who rely on the meaning rather than the words. All of this suggests that the teachings on tathagatagarbha and the teachings on emptiness or identitylessness are understood in the Lahkavatarasutra as actually being fully equivalent rather than the formers being a provisional and preliminary introduction to the latter. Indeed, as other tathagatagarbha sutras and R G W also suggest, the notion of buddha nature is exactly that which represents the correct understanding of emptiness."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"32 Translators IntroductionNow, an even more puzzling and ambiguous explanation of tathâga­tagarbha in the Laùkâvatârasütra is the one that equates it with the àlaya-consciousness. This àlaya-consciousness or tathàgata heart is said to contain both contaminated and uncontaminated latent tendencies, and thus to be both momentary and not momentary:Mahàmati, the àlaya-consciousness, which is known as “the tathàgata heart,” is momentary in its being associated with mentation as well as the latent tendencies of the active consciousnesses,98 [but] it is non- momentary [in its being associated] with the uncontaminated latent tendencies. Naïve ordinary beings who are attached to the doctrine of momentariness do not realize [the difference between] the momentar­iness and the nonmomentariness of all phenomena. Since they do not realize it, they destroy even unconditioned phenomena through their view of extinction.99Mahàmati, the collections of the five [sense] consciousnesses are not subject to samsàra, nor do they experience suffering and happiness, nor are they the causes of nirvàna. Mahàmati, what flourishes and ter­minates is the tathàgata heart, which is associated with the causes of the sufferings and happinesses that are experienced [as their results] and congeals through the four [kinds of] latent tendencies.100 It is not realized by naive beings whose minds are infused with conceptions about the view of momentariness.101Similarly, the sütra says that the tathàgata heart represents the cause of both virtue and nonvirtue, effects all births and existences in samsàra, and yet is free from a self and what is mine, just like a dancer doing various performances.102However, to leave no doubt about its ultimate stance and in line with its above statements about tathâgatagarbha, the sütra declares that the àlaya-consciousness—the tathàgata heart—is indestructible, just like golds or diamonds’ remaining the same without ever increasing or decreasing. If the attainment of realization were momentary, it says, the noble ones would become nonnoble ones. So how could naive beings who are not skilled in explaining the intentions behind certain statements examine the meaning of momentariness correctly?103The sütra also says repeatedly that the àlaya-consciousness, which is tainted by the impregnations of negative tendencies since beginningless time,104 is like the main body of a great ocean—uninterrupted, free from"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 33the flaw of impermanence, without any idea of a self, and naturally pure. The other seven consciousnesses are like its moving waves—being momen­tary, arisen from the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, caused by false imagination, and clinging to names and characteristics. Thus, the tathágata heart (the álaya-consciousness) is said to be naturally pure but, due to adventitious stains, it appears as if it were impure to non-Buddhists, šrávakas, and pratyekabuddhas. This álaya-consciousness still operates in non-Buddhists and even šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas who realize per­sonal identitylessness. It is only through the realization of bodhisattvas that it can undergo a change and be purified:Mahamati, the tathágata heart contains the causes of virtue and non­virtue and is the creator of all births and forms of existence. Free from a self and what is mine, like a dancer, it enters [all kinds of] dangerousforms of existence The tlrthikas, who cling to [different] causes, donot understand this. Being impregnated by all kinds of beginningless latent tendencies of the impregnations of negative tendencies of dis­cursiveness, it is called “álaya-consciousness.” Its body, together with the seven consciousnesses that arise from the ground of the latent ten­dencies of ignorance, always operates uninterruptedly, just like a great ocean and its waves, is free from the flaw of impermanence, is the ces­sation of the position of a self, and is utterly pure by nature. The seven consciousnesses such as mentation and the mental consciousness, which are other than this and arise and perish, are momentary, arise from the cause that is false imagination, focus on collections of shapes, activities, and distinct instances, cling to names and characteristics, do not understand that appearing forms and characteristics are ones own mind, do not discriminate happiness and suffering, are not the cause for liberation, arise through and give rise to names, characteris­tics, and rising desire, and have the [álaya-consciousness] as their cause and support. Immediately after the so-called sense faculties conjoined [with consciousness] have become exhausted and have ceased, the oth­ers [the consciousnesses] do not arise and operate [anymore] either. Those yogins who do not discriminate the thoughts of their own minds as happiness and suffering, who rest in the meditative absorption of the cessation of discriminations and feelings, and who are skilled in the four dhyánas, the [four] realities, and the [eight] liberations entertain the thought of [actually] having been liberated."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"34 Translators Introduction[However,] if the âlaya-consciousness, which is known as “the tathàgata heart,” does not undergo a change (parâvrtti), there is no ces­sation of the seven active consciousnesses. For what reason? Because the consciousnesses flourish by virtue of [the àlaya-consciousnesss serving as] their cause and support, and [because the àlaya-conscious­ness] is not an object of any of the yogins [who are immersed] in the yogas of srâvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and tlrthikas. Even when one realizes ones own lack of a personal self and apprehends the specific and general characteristics of the skandhas, dhàtus, and àyatanas, this tathàgata heart [still] flourishes. It terminates [only] through seeing the five dharmas, the [three] natures, and phenomenal identitylessness. Through its undergoing a change by progressing through the bhumis, one cannot be distracted by the views about the path that others, that is,the tlrthikas, [hold] Therefore, Mahàmati, bodhisattva mahàsattvaswho have this special goal should purify the tathàgata heart, which is known as “the àlaya-consciousness.”Mahàmati, suppose there were no tathàgata heart, which is known as “the àlaya-consciousness.” Mahàmati, without this tathàgata heart, which is known as “the àlaya-consciousness,” there would be no [such] flourishing and terminating. But, Mahàmati, there is [such] flour­ishing and terminating in naive beings and noble ones, respectively. The yogins who do not cease their efforts and are persevering abide by [dwelling in] their own personal experience of the noble ones and abiding blissfully amid the visible phenomena [of this life]. Mahàmati, this sphere that is the tathàgata heart, the àlaya-consciousness, is be­yond the dialectical views of srâvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and tlrthikas. Though it is completely pure by nature, due to its being afflicted by adventitious afflictions, it appears to them as if it were impure, but it does not [appear so] to the tathàgatas. Mahàmati, for the tathàgatas, it serves as the sphere of their direct perception, just like a myrobalan fruit in the palm of ones hand.105Mind (citta as a synonym of the àlaya-consciousness or the tathàgata heart) is said to be neither separated from nor connected with the latent tendencies—it remains the same but is ensnared by latent tendencies. The dirt-like latent tendencies that arise from the mental consciousness sully the mind, which resembles a white garment, just as space, the àlaya in the body is neither existent nor nonexistent. Once the mental consciousness"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources of the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 35has come to an end, mind as such is free of all turbidity—since mind knows all phenomena, it is buddhahood.106Thus, it is not surprising that the Lahkavatarasutra, similar to other tathagatagarbha sutras, Yogacara texts, and the Uttaratantra, uses the three examples of gold, water, and space for the purity of the mind free from adventitious stains:Just like pure gold,Water free from turbidity,And a cloudless sky,So is [the mind] pure of concepts.107The sutra explicitly distinguishes an ultimate alaya from a relative one that consists of cognizance (vijhapti). Ultimately, however, both are devoid of duality and thus are nothing but suchness:Since the ultimate alaya-consciousnessAnd the alaya of cognizanceAre removed from apprehender and apprehended,I teach them to be suchness.108A similar distinction is made with “mind” as an equivalent of the alaya- consciousness:The true nature of the mind is pureBut not the mind that arises from mistakenness.Mistakenness comes from the impregnations of negative tendencies— Therefore, the mind is not seen.109The text explicitly enumerates the eight consciousnesses as (1) the tathagata heart, which is known as the alaya-consciousness, (2) mentation, (3) the mental consciousness, and (4)—(8) the five sense consciousnesses.110 Once; the text even speaks of nine forms of consciousnesses:Through improper conception,Consciousness is operating In eight or nine different kinds,Just like waves on the ocean.111"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36 Translators IntroductionThe sütra does not explain what the ninth consciousness is, but it probably refers to tathagatagarbha as the pure essence of the àlaya-consciousness.112Thus, the above distinction between an ultimate and a relative àlaya and at least some of the passages in which the tathàgata heart is linked to the âlaya-consciousness suggest that the tathàgata heart is not always under­stood as a complete equivalent of the àlaya-consciousness but rather as its intrinsically pure nature once it has been fully purified of all its latent ten­dencies. Thus, the true nature of the àlaya-consciousness in the sense of the tathàgata heart is not to be relinquished but only purified from its ad­ventitious stains (this distinction is also made in a more explicit manner in the Ghanavyühasütra). This also implies that it is the tathágata heart as the essence of the àlaya-consciousness that represents the universal founda­tion of both samsàra and nirvána (that the âlaya-consciousness/tathagata­garbha is such a foundation is in fact stated in the sütra).On the other hand, as seen above, the text also states that the àlaya-con­sciousness is momentary, is associated with the other seven momentary consciousnesses, and is the root of afflictiveness. Immediately following the above passage that ends with the example of the myrobalan fruit, the sütra addresses such an obvious discrepancy by declaring that this is the ex­planation for šrávakas, while the equation of the àlaya-consciousness with permanent buddha nature is the explanation for the sake of great bodhi­sattvas with sharp faculties. Moreover, the Buddha explicitly links what he said about the tathàgata heart to the Srïmàlâdevïsütra and summarizes the Laûkàvatârasütras approach to the àlaya-consciousness and tathagata­garbha as follows:“Mahàmati, this is what I [expressed] in the teachings for Šrlmáládevi and also for the sake of other bodhisattvas whose insight is subtle, sharp, and pure: I explained the tathàgata heart, which is known as ‘àlaya-consciousness’ and is associated with the seven [remaining] con­sciousnesses, as the object of the tathàgatas for the sake of Šrlmáládevi in order to teach phenomenal identitylessness to the šrávakas, who are attached to the operating [of the àlaya-consciousness. But actually, in itself,] it is not the object of the dialectics of šrávakas, pratyekabud­dhas, and tlrthikas (who are other). Rather, Mahàmati, this very object of the tathàgatas—the object that is the tathàgata heart, the àlaya-con­sciousness—is [the object] of bodhisattva mahâsattvas like you, whose insight is subtle and sharp, whose intelligence is discriminating, and who rely on the meaning [rather than the words. However,] it is not"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathâgatagarbha Teachings 37[the object] of any tlrthikas (who are other), šrávakas, and pratyeka­buddhas, who cling to the expression of the teachings in a literal man­ner.113 Therefore, Mahàmati, you and other bodhisattva mahàsattvas should make efforts in fully realizing this object of all tathàgatas—the tathàgata heart, the àlaya-consciousness—and not be content with mere study.” Here, [the Buddha] spoke the following [verses]:The heart of the tathàgatasIs associated with the seven consciousnesses.Duality flourishes due to grasping And terminates through full realization.The mind appears like a reflection,Created by beginningless thought.When actual reality is seen as it is,Neither referents nor the referent-maker exist.Just as naive beings grasp at a fingertip And do not look at the moon [it points to],So those who are stuck on lettersDo not understand the true reality that is mine.Mind dances like a dancer,Mentation resembles a buffoon,And consciousness with the five [senses]Imagines appearances like a stage.114In sum, the Laùkâvatârasütra constantly appears to shift perspectives when presenting its crucial topics, such as endorsing versus more or less strongly criticizing or even denying the notions of a self, emptiness, identitylessness, the àlaya-consciousness, and cittamâtra. However, rather than simply taking them to be contradictory, when read carefully in comparison, such shifts in perspective appear to be attempts (though not very systematic) to differentiate mistaken and correct ways of understanding those notions such as tathâgatagarbha, a self, and emptiness.In particular, the sütra seems to present the notion of tathâgatagarbha in four ways: (1) as a full equivalent of the àlaya-consciousness, which is the basis of, and operates together with, the other seven consciousnesses, (2) as the pure essence of the àlaya-consciousness that is not to be removed"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"38 Translators Introductionbut only purified, (3) as the unchanging true self that only needs to be freed from its adventitious stains, and (4) as an equivalent of the correct un­derstanding of emptiness and identitylessness. Obviously (2) and (3) are closely related in meaning but described separately in different passages of the sütra.As for the notion of “disposition” (gotra)y thé Lankàvatàrasütra presents five kinds of beings with five different dispositions—those who possess the dispositions for realizing the sràvakayàna, the pratyekabuddhayàna, and the tathàgatayàna, respectively, those with an uncertain disposition, and those without disposition (agotraka). As for those without disposition, which are also called “those with great desire {icchantika),” not attaining buddha­hood, the text describes two very different types of such persons. The first are those who have no wish for liberation because they have abandoned all roots of virtue, which primarily means that they reject the mahayana teach­ings. However, at some point, they will reconnect with virtue through the blessings of the buddhas and thus also attain buddhahood eventually. For the buddhas never abandon any sentient being. The second type are those with great desire who are bodhisattvas, that is, those who have taken the vow not to enter parinirvâna until all sentient beings have attained parin­irvâna. They are referred to as “those with great desire” because their great desire is to lead all beings to buddhahood. It is by virtue of this aspiration and their skill in means that they do not enter nirvana. Another reason why they do not pass into nirvana is their realization that all phenomena are already nirvana primordially.The GhanavyùhasütraSimilar to the Lankàvatàrasütra, this text mainly discusses Yogâcâra themes (such as the three natures and the related threefold lack of nature).115 De­spite its not being mentioned in the Uttaratantra, RGVV, or the above lists of tathagatagarbha sütras, it contains some brief references to tathagata­garbha. Like several of the above sütras, the sütra says that the Tathagata is permanent, eternal, everlasting, peaceful, blissful, unconditioned, and indestructible. What is called “tathagata heart” is the dhâtu of nirvana or the dharmadhàtu, which is indestructible like space. No matter whether buddhas appear or not, this is the abiding true nature.Similar to the Lankàvatàrasütra, the Ghanavyùhasütra relates tathagata­garbha to the âlaya-consciousness. Though it does not always clearly dis­tinguish between âlaya-consciousness, àlaya, and tathagatagarbha, it some­times differentiates the defiled âlaya-consciousness from the pure âlaya."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 39This pure àlaya is then described as being naturally luminous, the object of those skilled in yoga, and a synonym of tathagatagarbha. Both the àlaya-consciousness and the pure àlaya/ tathagatagarbha abide together in sentient beings but are, respectively, like dirt and gold covered by dirt.What is luminous and always pure Is the àlaya of all living beings.Likewise, mentation, mind, and consciousness Cycle in the dhàtus of sentient beings,But there is neither increase nor decrease—Natural luminosity always shines.116No matter how ignorant beings think About the moons arising and waning,The moon itself lacks any arising and waning.Likewise, naive ignorant beings Always think about the arising and waning Of the àlaya-consciousness,But it is uncontaminated buddhahood.No matter how it may arise, this àlaya Does not become different through that.Being the matrix from which the active consciousnesses come,It is like the moon due to the [waxing and waning of] latent tendencies.117The sütra continues that the àlaya is the cause of afflicted and purified phe­nomena alike—the cause of all samsàric forms of existence, of the medi­tative equipoise of the noble ones who see the dharma, and the beautiful realms of all buddhas. When it is realized, buddhahood, the disposition, and the yàna are not different. The pure natural state of the àlaya is seen and heard by bodhisattvas—the supreme purity of the àlaya is seen as ad­hering to the bodies of all beings, as being endowed with the thirty-two ma­jor marks, as buddhas in all kinds of forms, and as the turning of the wheel of dharma. Just as the moon abides in the sky together with the multi­tude of stars, the àlaya and the consciousnesses abide together in the body. All bodhisattvas who are and will be prophesied as buddhas will become tathàgatas by virtue of the merit of the stainless àlaya.118"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"40 Translators IntroductionSome further examples among the many that this sütra presents of the purity of the âlaya-consciousness in the sense of tathâgatagarbhas being enclosed in its obscurations are as follows. Just as pure gold does not shine in its ore but shines when it is cleansed, the âlaya-consciousness within the seven consciousnesses is seen by yogins who purify it through samàdhi. Since butter exists in milk but is not seen, those who know that churn the milk to obtain butter. Likewise, the âlaya-consciousness within the seven consciousness is seen by the sages who churn and process it. Just as pure sun and moon crystals reveal their qualities through being hit by sun and moon rays, the uncontaminated âlaya-consciousness—the pure tathàgata heart— reveals its qualities, when it has undergone the fundamental change.119 Sim­ilarly, the sütra says:O king, the mind is inconceivable,Always being naturally luminous.It is the tathàgata heart,Which abides like gold in rocks.Together with the mind of latent tendencies,The àlaya of all seedsIs always the luminous natureOf what is afflicted and what is pure.Thus, the disposition of the tathàgatasJust as the waves of the ocean,The àlaya likewise pervadesWhat is inferior, medium, and supreme.120And:The àlaya with all kinds of seeds Is also the splendid121 sugata heart.The Tathàgata has taughtThis heart through the term àlaya.The heart that is also known as the àlaya Is not understood by those of weak insight"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 41Likewise, the purity within the álaya of consciousness Is the sphere of the noble ones—It always shines like gold.The álaya that is known as the heart Is not an object of the conceptual mind.The imaginary natures Cannot be conceived,While the perfect natureIs always seen by those capable of yoga.The subject that is the mental consciousness Is the entity that fetters childish beings.What appears [for them like] mirages and clusters of hairs Is seen by the noble ones as what is stainless.122Thus, similar to the Lankavatarasutra, this sütra implicitly equates the tathágata heart even with the perfect nature. One even finds Mahámudrá- like statements about this álaya:Through not knowing ones own thoughts,They arise similar to waves.Being liberated from thoughts and what is thought of Is the álaya of all sages.123Interestingly, the main interlocutor in this sütra has the name Vajragarbha and the same term is also used in the text as a synonym for tathagatagarbha and the pure álaya. In the same vein, the sütra also speaks of “the indestruc­tible vajra mind.”The BuddhávatamsakasütraApart from the above-mentioned example of a canvas with the universe painted on it (quoted in R G W ), in the context of the gradual purification of the tathágata heart, R G W briefly refers to the example of golds be­ing progressively purified, which refers to the process of the ten bhümis.124 This example is found in the Dasabhümikasütra within the Buddhávatam­sakasütra,125 though without being related in any way to buddha nature.Once, the Buddhávatamsakasütra126 uses the term tathágatagarbha with its typical meaning of buddha nature, speaking of “possessing the tathágata"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"42 Translators Introductionheart, which will be freed from the cocoons of the five doors of ignorance of all sentient beings.”127 In addition, the text uses tathâgatagarbha several times as an epithet of buddhahood and also says once that certain bodhisat­tvas are one with the body of the tathàgata heart. Once, a bodhisattva with the name Tathâgatagarbha is mentioned.The RatnakûtaIt seems that this sütra collection is mainly mentioned above in relation to tathâgatagarbha because the Srïmâlâdevïsütra is a part of it.128 The Rat- naküta also includes the Ratnacüdapariprcchâsütraj29 in which we find the example of the painters illustrating the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects, which is also used in the Uttaratantra (without mention­ing this sütra source). However, in themselves, both this example and this emptiness are not usually a part of the teachings on buddha nature. In ad­dition, a passage from the Kâsyapaparivarta in the Ratnakûta is quoted in R G W but without being related to tathâgatagarbha. Still, the Kâsyapapari­varta discusses the related notions of “the disposition of the noble ones” (âryagotra) and “buddha lineage or pedigree” (buddhavamsa). It says that the former is as equal and undifferentiated as space, devoid of both body and mind, in accordance with nirvàna, stainless, ultimately real, imperish­able, permanent, without self, and nonreferential.130 The continuity of “the buddha lineage” prevents bodhisattvas from entering the limited personal nirvàna of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas.131 Also, compared to arhats, the gods have more love even for beginner bodhisattvas who have just given rise to bodhicitta and whose faculties are not yet matured. For those bodhi­sattvas maintain “the buddha lineage” without interruption.132The RatnadàrikâpariprcchàsütraNeither the Tibetan nor the Chinese canons contain a Ratnadârikâpari- prcchâsütra. As it turns out, this is actually just another name of the Mahâyânopadesasütra.l33 At the end of the Mahâyânopadesasütra, the Buddha gives a list of synonyms for this sütra, which include Ratna- dârikâpariprcchâ. In the Mahâyânopadesasütra, the main interlocutor is indeed Ratnadàrikà and the Buddha teaches her the sixty-four qualities of awakening (including their individual causes) in the exact order as they are presented in the third chapter of the Uttaratantra (which explicitly refers to the Ratnadârikâsütra as the source of these qualities).134 However, these qualities are not specific to the tathâgatagarbha teachings and, with slight variations, appear in many other sütras too."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 43Like many other sütras, this one also speaks of a single yàna. In general, it contains teachings on emptiness that are quite standard. Toward the end of the sütra, Ratnadàrikà explains “the mudrâ of irreversibility of bodhi- sattvas” to Sâriputra in verses,135 beginning with:Here, the mudrâ of irreversibilityIs the realization of nondualityThrough having realized the dharmadhàtuAnd the dhàtu of sentient beings to be equal as true reality.This is followed by many verses that emphasize the equality of samsâra and nirvâna, the equality of the skandhas and buddhahood, and so on, and identify irreversibility to be emptiness, such as:Those are irreversible who realize The conditioned dhâtus And the unconditioned dhâtu To be empty of reality.And:The mudrâ of phenomena is emptiness There is no maturation and no elimination.Those who are sealed by the mudrâ of emptiness Are taught to be irreversible.The Sünyatânàmamahâsütra and MahâsünyatânâmamahâsütraAs mentioned before, these two sütras correspond to the Cülasuhnatasutta and Mahàsunnatasutta (Majjhima Nikâya 121 and 122), respectively, two of the few sütras from the Pâli canon that were also included in the Tibetan Kangyur,136The Cülasuhnatasutta begins by Ananda asking the Buddha whether he had correctly understood the Buddhas statement “Now, Ànanada, I of­ten abide in emptiness” (the remainder of the text makes it clear that this emptiness refers to the fruitional attainment of arhathood that is achieved through focusing on the empty aspect of nirvâna). The Buddha then illus­trates this sentence through a series of examples, beginning with saying that the palace where he and his samgha are residing at present is empty"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"44 Translators Introductionof elephants, cattle, horses, and so on, but is not empty of the assembly of monks. Likewise, the minds of monks in solitude are empty of the dis­tracting perceptions of villages and their people but are not empty of the perception of the forest they dwell in. The same is said for not perceiving the forest but only earth, not perceiving any of the above but progressively only perceiving one of the four formless absorptions (beginning with In­finite Space), and finally resting only in “the samádhi of the mind that is signless.” In that last stage, arhathood is attained, and the only remainder is the distractions of the six áyatanas based on the body. Each one of these examples and their meanings is followed by the famous passage:Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accordance with actual reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real existent.Obviously, in this sütra, emptiness is not used as a philosophical or metaphysical concept but is applied to a progressive “emptying” of the mind of distracting perceptions and conceptions. This meditative process culminates in arhathood, with the body and its six áyatanas as the only thing this arhathood is not empty of. Naturally, this has nothing to do with the notion of tathagatagarbha.In later Yogácára texts, the above passage was taken out of its original context and reinterpreted in different ways with regard to what is empty of what and what remains. Relevant in our context here is R G W s incorpo­rating this passage in its comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55, immediately after the following quote from the Šrímáládevisútra:The tathágata heart is empty of all cocoons of afflictions that are sep­arable [from it] and [can] be realized as being divisible [from it]. It is not empty of the inconceivable buddha attributes that are inseparable [from it], [can]not be realized as being divisible [from it], and far sur­pass the sand grains in the river Gañgá [in number].137Thus, RG W ” implies that “what does not exist somewhere” refers to the “cocoons of afflictions” and that “somewhere” is the tathágata heart, which is empty of these afflictions and thus represents the really existent remain­der. RG W ’ concludes then that this is “the unmistaken defining character­istic of emptiness [in the case of the tathágata heart] since it [thus] is free from the extremes of superimposition and denial.”138 It is obviously this"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 45interpretation of that passage that caused Tibetan commentators such as Dolpopa to include the Sünyatànâmamahàsütra in the category of tathagata­garbha sütras.The contents of the Mahâsünyatànàmamahàsütra are distinct from the Sünyatânâmamahâsütra, and it also explains the notion of emptiness in a different way. For, in the former sütra, the Buddha teaches about mentally engaging in internal emptiness in the sense of relinquishing the clinging to a personal self through training in the dhyânas, mentally engaging in external emptiness in the sense of relinquishing the clinging to phenomena such as form that are considered as “what is mine,” and mentally engaging in both internal and external emptiness. Clearly, the sütra contains nothing about tathàgatagarbha.139The Abhidharm am ahàyânasütraThis text is a lost Yogàcàra sütra, which is preserved only in a few quotes in other Yogàcàra texts.140 At least in those quotes, there is nothing specific about buddha nature. However, R G W explicitly links the most famous verse from this sütra to a quote from the Tathàgatagarbhasütra and the no­tion of tathàgatagarbha:141The dhàtu of beginningless time Is the foundation of all phenomena.Since it exists, all forms of existence142 And also nirvana are obtained.R G W also comments on the four lines of this verse through four quotes from the Srïmàlàdevïsütra that likewise expand on tathàgatagarbha. In the context of denying that there are any sentient beings who lack the buddha disposition, R G W quotes another verse as support for all beings being suitable to eventually become buddhas:143Though beginningless, [samsara] entails an end.What is naturally pure and consists of permanent dharmasIs not seen since it is externally obscured by a beginningless cocoon,Just as a golden image that is concealed.According to Jamgon Kongtrul, this verse is also from the Abhidharma- mahàyânasütra.144 In any case, it greatly resembles the ninth example for"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"46 Translators Introductionbuddha natures being obscured by adventitious stains in the Tathàgata- garbhasütra and the Uttaratantra.The TathàgatagunajüânâcintyavisayâvatàranirdeàasütraThis work mentions once that all buddhas are permanent, eternal, and im­mutable but does not contain any teachings on buddha nature per se.145 It is quoted once in R G W as the alternative source (besides the Dhàranî- svararàjasütra) of the seventh vajra point (enlightened activity).The SarvabuddhavisayâvatârajfrànâlokâlamkàrasütraThis sütra is quoted several times in R G W.146 In its comments on one of these quotes (the Tathàgatas seeing the dhàtu of sentient beings, which is pure, stainless, and without afflictions), R G W explicitly equates the tathàgata heart with the dhàtu of sentient beings.147 The sütra also says that the Tathàgata’s own purity and the purity of sentient beings are not two and cannot be made two (similar statements are frequently found in the prajüàpàramità sütras). In addition, the nine examples for enlightened ac­tivity in the Uttaratantra come from this sütra (though unacknowledged). However, it does not contain any specific teachings on buddha nature.The M ahàmeghasütraZimmermann (2002) says that two in a series of examples in the Mahà- meghasütra148 closely resemble those in the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra. The ex­amples compare the state of not living according to the teachings and of not entering into a certain samàdhi to (1) winter rice and so on, which have not yet fulfilled their nature of benefitting beings and (2) the fruits of a palmyra palm, a mango tree, and cane (the same enumeration as in the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra), which have not yet become such trees. Though the thrust of the examples in the Mahàmeghasütra differs from those in the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra, the examples themselves clearly echo basic ele­ments of the latter sütra. Also, one of the bodhisattvas in the audience has the name Tathâgatagarbha. However, apart from these features, this sütra shows no elements of tathâgatagarbha teachings.The GaganagañjapariprcchasütraA passage from this sütra149 is quoted by R G W150 in the context of the tathàgata hearts being like space, while the skandhas and so on that arise in it resemble the elements.

However, this statement is found in many sütras.

The first quote describes how bodhi­sattvas deliberately retain certain afflictions in order to be reborn in samsara and yet are not harmed by these afflictions. The second quote uses the example of the purification of a precious beryl that had been lying in the mud for many years. This example, the sütra says, illustrates that bodhi­sattvas see the natural luminosity of the mind of sentient beings, which is obscured by adventitious afflictions but never tainted in its essence (this is repeated once elsewhere). By virtue of that, they give rise to the mind-set for purifying the minds of sentient beings and liberating them. Elsewhere, the sütra says that the dhâtu of sentient beings is primordially pure and that what is called a “sentient being” refers simply to mistakenness, ignorance, samsâric existence, craving, being ensnared by views, and improper men­tal engagement. The text also states that bodhisattvas constantly give rise to compassion, make efforts, and dedicate their own virtues and those of others so that the lineage of the three jewels does not become interrupted. Otherwise, this sütra does not contain elements of the teachings on buddha nature.The SthiràdhyàsayaparivartasütraR G W relates a brief passage from this sütra153 to the first three vajra points (the three jewels) of the Uttaratantra, which seems to be the reason why it became included in the category of tathagatagarbha sütras. However, there is nothing in this sütra that is related to the teachings on tathaga­tagarbha— it mainly teaches that all phenomena are empty, without arising, and ceasing, which means that attachment and so on with regard to them are pointless.The SuvarnaprabhàsottamasütraThis sütra mentions the term tathagatagarbha once in passing, equating it with the mahayana.154 Otherwise, it contains nothing about buddha nature.

Here, the treasure stands for the texts central theme of “the dhâtu of nonconceptuality,” which is obscured by different types of con­ceptions. The text otherwise shows distinct Yogàcàra elements and also re­sembles the prajnàpàramità sütras in style.The Samdhinirm ocanasütraThis famous Yogàcàra sütra contains nothing about tathàgatagarbha.156The Prasàntaviniscayapràtihâryanàm asam àdhisütraThe Prasàntaviniscayapràtihâryanàmasamàdhisütra157 declares that saying “The Tathàgata is permanent and the Tathàgata is eternal” is of far greater merit than someone elses giving all kinds of gifts to the retinues of the buddhas in all worlds in the ten directions. The sütra also speaks once of “seizing the disposition of the three jewels.” However, since it also refers several times to “the Buddha disposition,” “the dharma disposition,” and “the samgha disposition” (which do not refer to tathàgatagarbha), this ex­pression is most probably only a general term for those three. The sütra shows no discussion of buddha nature.The CandrapradïpasütraThe contents of the Samâdhiràjasütra,158 of which the Candrapradïpasütra is a shorter and earlier version, are described by Gomez and Silk (1989, 15-16) as follows:The sütra declares its main theme to be a particular samàdhi that is supposed to be the key to all elements in the path and to all the vir­tues and merits of buddhas and bodhisattvas. This state of mind, or spiritual practice, is called “the samàdhi that is manifested as the same­ness of the essential nature of all dharmas” (sarva-dharma-svabhavâ- samatâ-vipancita-samâdhi). . . here the term “samàdhi” is understood in its broadest signification.

The word samadhi is also used to mean the sutra itself. Consequently, we can speak of an equation, sutra = samadhi = ¿unyata, underlying the text. In this sense the title Samadhiraja expresses accu­rately the content of the sutra.And:The Samadhiraja... has been identified consistently with the Madhya- maka tradition. Regamey has shown, however, that the Samadhiraja cannot be considered a clear representative of a single philosophical tradition. The sutra s doctrinal position cannot be described accurately as unambiguously Madhyamika, or even as pure sunyavada. That is to say, one would find it difficult to show that the sutra is the prod­uct of, or a legitimate representative of, Madhyamika circles. Still, it is obvious that the sutra was considered highly authoritative by Madhyamika scholastics and ignored by Yogacara authors. In spite of its clearly defined philosophical position, the Samadhiraja does not fit our stereotype of a sectarian document.... Furthermore, in terms of religious types it is eclectic and universalistic, so that it would be point­less to attempt to box it in some general category. It makes room for more than one dimension of Buddhist religion: meditation, worship of the Buddhas, the cult of the Book, philosophical speculation, re­hearsal of myth (in avadana style) and so on. At the present stage of our knowledge of the history of Mahayana sutra literature, we can only say that the Samadhiraja played an important role as a “proof text” for the Madhyamaka. But it seems unlikely that the text was composed with such a role in mind. It would be more accurate to say that it was conceived as a representative text of general doctrine, with a strong leaning towards a philosophic position that can be described as akin to that of the Madhyamaka. Because of its comprehensive, almost en­cyclopedic, character, it offered a wider range of ideas from which to quote than did other texts, (ibid., 31)In any case, it is clear that this sutra does not include any discussion ofbuddha nature or related topics."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"50 Translators IntroductionThe SaddharmapundarïkasütraThis sûtra159 does not teach on tathâgatagarbha but Zimmermann (1998) shows several structural, formal, and doctrinal parallels between the ear­lier Saddharmapundarïkasütra and the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra, which seem to have influenced the composition of the latter. Also, the Saddharma- pundarïkasütms example of a man’s carrying a jewel in the hem of his garment without knowing it and later needing to be told about it by a friend in order to retrieve it and use it to overcome some difficulties is very similar to the examples in the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra. In the Saddharma­pundarïkasütra, the example illustrates arhats’ not being aware of their wish for omniscient buddha wisdom that they made a long time ago and thus remaining with only limited wisdom. The example serves to support the Saddharmapundarïkasütras central theme of the single yàna that even arhats enter eventually to achieve the only soteriological goal of buddha­hood. This theme is, of course, also a crucial element in the teachings on tathâgatagarbha, and the Saddharmapundarïkasütras example maybe seen as echoing Uttaratantra I.35ab and 1.40, which say that weariness of samsàra and wishing for nirvàna are triggered by the existence of the tathàgata heart in beings. While the Saddharmapundarïkasütra keeps saying that all be­ings should become buddhas, the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra explains the reason why all beings are able to become buddhas—they already possess the heart of a tathàgata. Thus, against this background, it is only natural that Ut­taratantra 11.58-59 mentions the Saddharmapundarïkasütra as an example of teaching the true reality of phenomena to arhats, thereby turning them away from their clinging to having attained true nirvàna. After that, they are finally matured in the supreme yàna through prajñá and means and their buddhahood is prophesied. The Saddharmapundarïkasütra also em­phasizes the permanence of the Buddha and says that buddha wisdom and not emptiness is the supreme achievement.The RatnameghasùtraThis sütra160 says that suchness is beyond the sphere of all afflictions, the sphere of the personally experienced wisdom of the noble ones, stainless, permanent, everlasting, immutable, and indestructible—no matter whether tathàgatas arise or not, this dharmadhâtu definitely remains. However, such statements are found in other sütras too and are not necessarily elements of the tathâgatagarbha teachings. Beyond that, this sütra contains no specific elements of those teachings."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Sütra Sources o f the Tathagatagarbha Teachings 51The DharmasamgïtisütraThis text161 discusses many general mahayana themes (such as the ten pàramitàs, emptiness, and compassion). The text speaks repeatedly about the three doors to liberation (emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness) but also uses terms such as “false imagination” and “fundamental change.” The great compassion of bodhisattvas is said to include all the teachings of the Buddha. Thus, to be endowed with such great compassion is like having all his instructions lying on the palm of ones hand. There are also discus­sions between two bodhisattvas about the nature, the birth, the abiding, and the death of the Buddha and in what sense these are to be understood. The sütra contains a few passages that could be taken as being related to tathagatagarbha, though they are not very specific. Once the text speaks of “the heart of sentient beings” and equates it with omniscience and com­pletely perfect buddhahood. Elsewhere, the primary and secondary afflic­tions are said to be adventitious, while the dharmadhâtu is without coming and going and therefore is neither adventitious nor abiding. Since the dhar­madhâtu is equality, it is the nirvana of tathàgatas. Finally, the sütra says that fire is present in all wood but without the proper conditions and some effort coming together, a fire will not burn from wood. Likewise, tathàgata- hood abides in all knowable objects (!), but without the proper conditions such as faith and some effort, it does not manifest and does not perform the activity of a buddha.The Prajhàpâramitâ SütrasThese sütras (with the one minor exception in the Prajnâpâramitâsütra in One Hundred Fifty Lines mentioned above) obviously contain nothing about buddha nature.In sum, among all the above sütras, the only ones that clearly contain teachings on tathagatagarbha are the following eight:1. Tathagatagarbhasutra2. Anünatvâpürnatvanirdesaparivarta3. Srïmâlâdevïsütra4. Angulimaliyasutra5. Mahaparinirvanasutra6. Mahàbherïsütra7. Lankâvatârasütra8. Ghanavyühasütra"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"52 Translators IntroductionIt is unfortunate that none of the Tibetan authors mentioned provides any criteria for including or excluding certain sütras in their above lists of “tathàgatagarbha sütras,” “sütras of definitive meaning,” and so on, and that they do not explain what the differences between these categories are. For example, it is not clear why Dolpopa, Târanâtha, and others do not include the Lankàvatàrasütra and the Ghanavyühasütra in their lists of “tathagata sütras” since especially the former sütra discusses tathàgatagarbha in detail (one can only speculate that this exclusion may be due to the equation of tathàgatagarbha with the âlaya-consciousness and emptiness). Also, it is striking that theAnünatvàpürnatvanirdesaparivarta as an important source of the Uttaratantra is absent from all the lists of “tathàgatagarbha sütras” and “sütras of definitive meaning” except for those by the Gelugpa scholars Kedrub Jé, Kungtang Gôncho Denpé Drônmé, and Tukwan Lobsang Chôkyi Nyima. On the other hand, varying numbers of sütras that do not discuss buddha nature at all have found their way into all of the above lists.Now, the reasons why sütras other than the eight listed above were in­cluded in the various lists of tathàgatagarbha sütras seem to be due to one or more of the following criteria—being linked to the teachings on tathàgata­garbha in the Uttaratantra or RGW , containing certain key phrases that can be related to these teachings, and including certain examples that can be interpreted in accordance with the notion of tathàgatagarbha. In addi­tion, certain sütras appear to have been included by some Tibetan scholars under those sütras that are said to teach the ultimate definitive meaning because some of their contents are in general accordance with the Shen- tong view (such as the “Maitreya Chapter,” the Samdhinirmocanasütra, and the Lankàvatàrasütra). For some sütras, the reasons why they were included are not clear (such as the Suvarnaprabhàsottamasütra and the Pahcasatikàprajüàpàramitàsütra).162Finally, it is remarkable that, in contrast to many other major mahayana sütras, there are no known Indian commentaries on any of the tathàgata­garbha sütras (except for the Lankàvatàrasütra). However, given that the Uttaratantra and R G W use and elaborate on the typical terminologies and templates of virtually all tathàgatagarbha sütras listed above, it seems appropriate to regard the Uttaratantra as a synopsis or digest of all these sütras and R G W as a general commentary on them."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Different Ways of Explaining the Meaning of TathagatagarbhaAs for the meaning of the Sanskrit compound tathagatagarbha, its first part (tatha) can be taken as either the adverb “thus” or the noun “thusness/such- ness” (as a term for ultimate reality; many texts, among them the Uttaratan- tra, gloss tathagatagarbha as “suchness”). The second part can be read either asgata (“gone”), or agata (“come, arrived”; the Tibetan gshegspa can mean both). However, in the term tathagata, both meanings more or less come down to the same. Thus, the main difference lies in whether one un­derstands a tathagata as (a) a “thus-gone/thus-come one” or (b) “one gone/ come to thusness,” with the former emphasizing the aspect of the path and the latter the result. The final part of the compound—garbha—literally and originally means “embryo,” “germ,” “womb,” “the interior or middle of anything,” “any interior chamber or sanctuary of a temple,” “calyx” (as of a lotus), “having in the interior,” “containing,” or “being filled with.” At some point, the term also assumed the meanings of “core,” “heart,” “pith,” and “essence” (which is also the meaning of its usual Tibetan translation snying po).163 As Zimmermann points out, Sanskrit or Pali dictionaries do not ex­plain garbha in those ways, but the corresponding forms of the term in sev­eral modern Indian languages can have all of those meanings. In addition, late Indian Buddhist texts also refer to such meanings. For instance, Krsna s Yogaratnamald and Ratnakarasantis M uktavali (both commentaries on the Hevajratantra) equate garbha in vajragarbha with hrdaya. Jayarathas Tantralokaviveka, a commentary on the Tantrdloka, interprets garbha as sara,164 Wayman and Wayman (1974, viii-ix) mention that, in commen­taries on the Guhyagarbhatantra, garbha is not only explained as womb (kuksi) and embryo (bhruna) but also as middle or center (madhyama).In that vein, as a proficient Sanskrit translator, Go Lotsawa Shonnu Bal165 (1392-1481) explains a number of Sanskrit synonyms of garbha and cor­relates some of them with the three aspects of garbha in the Uttaratan- tra—the dharmakaya, suchness, arid the disposition.166 He says that sara53"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"54 Translators Introductionrepresents a basis from which many dharmas radiate or emanate, thus re­ferring to the dharmakàya. Hrdaya has the sense of being crucial or very precious, like a human heart. Thus, it refers to suchness because those who wish for liberation need to regard it as crucial or precious. Garbha itself means “seed” or “womb.” Since it stands for something that is present in an enclosing sheath, it refers to the disposition. Furthermore, manda means “something very firm” or “quintessence,” as in calling the vajra seat in Bodhgàya bodhimanda or speaking of “the essence of butter.” Also, ac­cording to Vasubandhus commentary on the Dasabhümikasütra, garbha means something solid, like the core of a tree. However, in general, Go Lotsàwa says, all four terms can apply to all these meanings.JKC explains garbha similarly but differs in its glosses of sâra and hrdaya and relates all three terms to suchness.167 Garbha refers to something that exists in the middle of an enclosure or a sheath that covers it. Therefore, at the time of the ground, suchness appears to be obscured by adventitious stains and to exist in their middle. The term hrdaya means “essence” or “supreme,” so this suchness is the essence or what is supreme. Sara refers to being firm and stable, thus indicating that suchness never changes.168Technically speaking, the term tathagatagarbha can be understood as ei­ther a bahuvrîhi or a tatpurusa compound, meaning “containing a tathàgata (as ones core or heart)” or “the core or heart of a tathàgata,” respectively. The first one is the most natural reading and is also supported by numerous passages in the scriptures, but the tatpurusa version is also found in R G W and elsewhere.169Explanations o/Tathàgatagarbha in Indian TextsAs for the different ways in which the notion of tathagatagarbha is ex­plained in Indian Buddhist scriptures, Go Lotsàwa s introduction to his GC presents four meanings in general and four meanings in the Uttaratantra in particular.170 The first four are: (1) the emptiness that has the character­istic of being a nonimplicative negation, (2) the luminous nature of the mind (the basic element of awareness), (3) the àlaya-consciousness, and (4) all bodhisattvas and sentient beings. In the Uttaratantra, the tathàgata heart is taught as having the three specific characteristics: (1) dharmakàya, (2) suchness, and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) nonconceptuality.171"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Tathagatagarbha as the Emptiness That Is a Nonimplicative NegationAs for buddha natures being explained as the emptiness that is a nonim­plicative negation, based on quotations from Bhàviveka s (c. 500-570) Madh- yamakahrdaya, its commentary Tarkajvàlà, and Candraklrtis (c. 600-650) Catuhsatakatïkà, GC says that emptiness is asserted by these masters as a nonimplicative negation. In particular, it is this kind of emptiness that Bhàviveka’s Tarkajvàlâ refers to as “tathagata heart” in response to the cri­tique of some sravakas that, in the mahayana, the tathagata heart is said to have the characteristic of being all-pervasive, which contradicts the third seal of the Buddha s teachings—that all phenomena are empty and without self:[The expression] “possessing the tathagata heart” is [used] because emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and so on, exist in the mind streams of all sentient beings. However, it is not something like a per­manent and all-pervasive person that is the inner agent.172 For we find [passages] such as “All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, sign­lessness, and wishlessness. What is emptiness, signlessness, and wish­lessness is the Tathagata.”173Candraklrti s Madhyamakàvatàrabhàsya on VI.42 says:One should know that since [the alaya-consciousness] follows the na­ture of all entities, it is nothing but emptiness that is taught through the term “alaya-consciousness.”174GC comments that it is not possible for Candraklrti not to have seen that the tathàgata heart is well known as the alaya-consciousness, which is stated many times in the Lankàvatàrasütra, and thus he asserts this emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation as the tathàgata heart.175 Candraklrti, GC says, saw the explanation that, based on quoting the Lankàvatàrasütra, the state­ment of the emptiness of sentient beings being a buddha adorned with all major and minor marks is of expedient meaning. Thus, his Madhyamakà­vatàrabhàsya states that the tathàgata heart is of expedient meaning.176According to GC, Aryavimuktisena (sixth century) and Haribhadra (mid-eighth-early ninth century) explain the emptiness that is a nonimpli­cative negation as the disposition and the svàbhàvikakàya.177 Jñánagarbha (early eighth century) even explains it as the dharmakàya, thus implicitly asserting it as the tathàgata heart.178 GC also adds the position of NgogDifferent Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 55"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"56 Translators IntroductionLotsâwa and his followers that the tathàgata heart is the emptiness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation that is taught in Nàgàrjunas “collec­tion of reasoning.”179 They explain the statement that all sentient beings are pervaded by the dharmakàya as sentient beings’ being suitable to attain the dharmakàya.One should add here Kamalaslla s (c. 740-795) Madhyamakâloka, which takes the tathàgata heart to be natural luminosity but defines the latter as the dharmadhàtu characterized by twofold identitylessness:This statement “All sentient beings possess the tathàgata heart” teaches that all are suitable to attain the state of unsurpassable completely per­fect awakening since it is held that the term tathàgata expresses that the dharmadhàtu, which is characterized by personal and phenomenal identitylessness, is natural luminosity.180Kamalaslla’s interpretation seems to be based on the term tathâgata- nairâtmyagarbha (“the heart of nonself of a tathàgata”) mentioned above in the Lankâvatàrasütra,m which indicates that buddha nature does not refer to an àtman but to the lack of a self. This approach of Kamalaslla influenced later Màdhyamikas in their take on the tathàgata heart, as seen in Jayànanda’s (eleventh century) Madhyamakâvatâratîkâ182 and Abhayà- karagupta’s (died 1125) M unimatàlamkâra,183 Kamalaslla also quotes the passage from the Lañkavatárasütra that Candrakirti used to establish the teaching on buddha nature as being of expedient meaning.184 However, Kamalaslla does not follow Candrakirti in that regard but only states that, depending on the different ways of thinking of those to be guided, the Bud­dha taught nothing but the dharmadhàtu through a variety of conventional means (including the expression “tathàgata heart”).It should also be noted in this context that virtually all early Indian Yo- gàcàra masters (such as Asafiga, Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, and Asvabhàva), if they refer to the term tathágatagarbha at all, always explain it as nothing but suchness in the sense of twofold identitylessness.185 Thus, all Indian Màdhyamikas (except for Nàgàrjuna in his Dharmadhâtustava) and virtu­ally all classical Yogàcàra masters up to the tenth century were not willing to openly embrace the tathágatagarbha teachings as anything other than emptiness, obviously being very concerned about not getting anywhere near the non-Buddhist notion of an âtman. Interestingly, the exceptions in this regard among early Indian Yogàcàras all “went into exile,” teaching and translating in China, with their works being preserved only in Chinese."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 57The most prominent among them are Gunabhadra (394-468), Ratnamati, Bodhiruci (both fifth-sixth century), and especially Paramártha (499-569), all of whom extensively translated and taught Yogácára and tathdgatagar- bha materials. In India, it was only later Yogácáras, such as Jñánasrlmitra and Ratnákarasánti, who interpreted the tathágata heart along the lines of minds luminous nature (see right below).186Tathdgatagarbha as Mind’s Luminous NatureGo Lotsáwa’s GC continues that, in terms of the tathágata hearts being explained as the luminous nature of the mind (the basic element of aware­ness), Uttaratantra I.63ab says:The luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.Therefore, it explains the tathágata heart as suchness. Mahdydnasütrd- lamkara XIII. 19 states:It is asserted that mind is always natural luminosity And that it is tainted by adventitious stains.Apart from the mind that is the nature of phenomena,No other mind is proclaimed to be luminous in nature.187Thus, these and other passages explain the true nature of the mind—the basic element of awareness—as the tathágata heart. GC continues that the same is also stated in many texts by Nágárjuna (such as his Dharmadha- tustava, Cittavajrastava, and Bodhicittavivarana)m and a great number of sütras of the final dharma wheel.189As indicated above, a few later Indian Yogácáras need to be added here. For example, the beginning of the sixth chapter of Jñánaárlmitras Sdkdra- siddhi says that one can neither superimpose the tiniest thing that does not manifest lucidly (aprakdsa) nor deny even the slightest trace of what manifests lucidly (prakdsa).190 In order to support this statement, he quotes the Madhyantavibhdga, Mahdyanasütrdlamkdra, Abhisamaydlamkdra, and Uttaratantra. After identifying the wrong positions of superimposition and denial, Jñánasrlmitra cites Uttaratantra 1.154 and RGVV and explains that real aspects are mental forms that have the nature of being appear­ances of lucidity (prakdsarüpa), which he equates with buddha nature—the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"58 Translator s Introductiontathagata element (tathagatadhatu). Just as this tathagata element, those lucid forms are free from all superimposition and denial.191Ratnákarašánti generally describes the tathagata heart as being equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness, and the perfect nature (which he considers to be an implicative negation and not a nonimplica­tive negation).192 As for the ontological status of mind, his Prajñáparamito- padesa says that it does not exist as apprehender and apprehended, but the existence of the sheer lucidity of experience cannot be denied.193 The text also brings up the well-known objection against the existence of self-aware­ness, known from the Lañkávatárasütra and Šántidevas Bo dicaryáv atara, that mind is unable to act upon itself, just as a sword cannot cut itself and a finger cannot touch itself.194 In his answer, Ratnákarašánti emphasizes the soteriologically crucial role of minds fundamental natures being nondual self-awareness. If mind just experiences its own delusional superimposi­tions onto this nature, it appears as mistakenness (called “alaya-conscious- ness”), but when it realizes its own true nature directly, it is unmistaken nondual wisdom or the dharmakaya. The transition from the former to the latter state is accomplished through progressively stripping away all charac­teristics of mistakenness, thus experiencing the lucidity of all phenomena empty of duality. Ratnákarašánti also highlights the fact that realization and buddhahood cannot be reasonably defined as the cessation of the entirety of mind and mental factors (as Candraklrti does),195 but that the uncontaminated characteristics of their continuum remain and continue to operate forever. He also says that the liberated minds of šrávaka and pratyekabuddha arhats and buddhas are taught to be equally pure, but the qualities of the fundamental change of buddhahood as the full expression of minds natural luminosity are far greater since the dharmakaya functions as the support of the buddha qualities.196 Thus, Ratnákarašánti clearly ar­gues against all Mádhyamikas who deny self-awareness, while emphasizing that it is precisely this self-awareness that is the nature of the experiential quality of realizing the ultimate, adding that this nondual wisdom is empty because it is devoid of adventitious mistakenness.197As for the tathagata hearts being temporarily obscured by adventitious stains, Ratnákarašántis Sütrasamuccayabhásya quotes the Buddha, Nágár- juna, and Maitreya and concludes that buddha nature is the single dispo­sition that serves as the basis for there being only a single yána ultimately:Since the dharmadhátu has the meaning of disposition they are in­separable. Therefore, since all [beings] possess the tathagata heart, its"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 59fruition is just a single yàna. However, since it was taught as various yànas in the form of progressive means of realization and [since] this disposition does not appear due to [being obscured by] afflictions and so on, temporarily, [the Buddha] spoke of five dispositions. For, he said:Just as within stony debris Pure gold is not seen,And then is seen through being purified,Tathàgatas [become visible] in the world.198Also noble Nàgàrjuna says [in his Dharmadhâtustava]:In a pregnant womans womb,A child exists but is not seen.Just so, dharmadhàtu is not seen,When its covered by afflictions.199Likewise, noble Maitreya states [in his Uttaratantra]:Because the illuminating dharmadhàtu radiates light,There is no difference in suchness,And the actuality of the disposition appears,All [sentient beings] possess the sugata heart.200Therefore, just as [described in] the Tathâgatagarbhasütra, though [the tathàgata heart] is ensnared by afflictions, when the conditions for [its] awakening have formed, all [yànas] are simply a single yàna.201This tathàgata heart is naturally pure suchness, merely obscured by ad­ventitious stains, and the natural luminosity that is free from apprehender and apprehended:The essence of the nature of phenomena is called “tathàgata heart.” The dhàtu is the suchness that is naturally pure and associated with stains.

The characteristic of its being devoid of stains from the very beginning is called “purity,” which refers to being devoid of apprehender and apprehended.203Naturally luminous mind is the self-awareness that remains after all af­flictive and cognitive obscurations (apprehender and apprehended) have been relinquished. When this self-aware luminous mind is realized, it is called “nirvana”:As for “minds true nature lacking any difference by way of a distinct division in terms of mistakenness and unmistakenness,” it is said, “Mind does not exist by any nature of its own.” Since afflictedness is mistakenness, it is not established through a nature of its own, that is, through reasoning. “But how is what is purified established?” It is said, “through mind just as it is.” This is self-aware luminous mind, just as it is, which is free from [all] afflictive and cognitive obscurations in the form of the characteristics of apprehender and apprehended. As for “mind not existing,” it refers to [mind s appearing as] apprehender and apprehended. “What is mind” is the self-awareness that is free from those [two]. Since this [latter mind] is not understood by those who just see this life, it is the inconceivable dhatu. In brief, what is called “nirvana” is analyzed by prajna as being the realization of self-aware luminosity.204Compare also Ratnakarasantis Suddhamati commentary on the Abhi- samaydlamkara, which describes minds luminosity as being obscured by adventitious stains by saying “the [nature of phenomena] is natural lumi­nosity, while the activity of the path is to terminate the adventitious obscu­rations”205 and “ultimately, signlessness is sheer lucidity.”206 Thus, ultimate reality is not the utter lack of any entity, but mind s ultimate luminosity:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Just as suchness, the defining characteristic of mind is not the lack of any entity because it has the defining characteristic of utter lucid­ity. Mind is not other than suchness because it is not different from lucidity.207Consequently, the fruition of buddhahood is nothing but this luminos­ity with all its innate qualities having become free from adventitious stains:The uncontaminated dharmas, which are the nature of dharmatá com­pletely pure in all aspects, make up the svábhávikakáya of the buddha bhagaváns. For, through being free from all adventitious mistakenness, they abide as that nature. As [Maháyánasutrálamkára IX.2] says:The knowledge of all aspects is attained—Immaculateness in terms of all obscurations.Buddhahood is illustrated By a jewel casket thrown open.208Likewise, the text says that the uncontaminated dharmas make up the svábhávikakáya because, through being free from all mistakenness, they are the sheer dharmatá that has the character of lucidity.209In sum, in his works Ratnákarašánti generally sees himself as a Mádh­yamika, but one who integrates many essential elements of Yogácára and the teachings on buddha nature, such as emphasizing the soteriologically crucial role of minds nature being nondual lucid self-awareness—the tathágata heart—which is only obscured by adventitious stains and needs to be experienced in an unmediated manner as what it truly is. This self- aware natural luminosity is what remains after all obscurations have been eliminated. In other words, the realization of the ultimate or buddhahood is not the mere cessation of the entirety of mind and mental factors, but the pure elements of their continuum remain as the wisdom minds of bodhi- sattvas and buddhas.210A commentary on the Heart Sutra by Mahájana211 speaks of emptiness as an implicative negation and says that all phenomena have the character of minds luminous nature.212 Interestingly, Mahájana explains the word kula in kulaputra (“son of good family”) and kuladuhitá (“daughter of good family”) as having the disposition (kula or gotra) of bodhisattvas, which he glosses as the tathágata heart.

Thus, based on the tathàgata heart, bodhi- sattvas develop bodhicitta, practice the six pàramitàs, and so the entire path unfolds.213 In the context of explaining the mantra of prajñápáramitá, Mahàjana says that the phrase “the mantra that calms all suffering” refers to this mantra’s being the cause for realizing the four pàramitàs of purity, self, permanence, and bliss on the final path of nonlearning.214 As described in several tathágatagarbha sútras and the Uttaratantra, these four pàramitàs are the ultimate defining characteristics of the tathàgata heart.215Prasàstrasena’s Àryaprajüâpâramitâhrdayatïkâ comments on the Heart Sütra!s phrase “all phenomena are without arising, ceasing, purity, impu­rity, increase, and decrease” by using the notion of buddha nature (sangs rgyas kyi ngo bo), which exists without any change in all beings, is naturally pure, and is only obscured by adventitious stains:As for [the sütras] saying “without arising, without ceasing,” the sub­sequent existence of what did not exist before is called “arising.” The subsequent nonexistence of what existed before is called “cessation.” Since this buddha nature—the dharmadhàtu, ultimate emptiness—has no beginning point, an endpoint is not to be found. Therefore, [the sütra] says, “without arising, without ceasing.”Even when sentient beings cycle on the five paths [of rebirth in samsàra], buddha nature does not become stained. Therefore, [the sütra] speaks of “purity.” Even when awakening to unsurpassable com­pletely perfect awakening, there is no superior purity than buddha na­ture. Therefore, [the sütra] says, “without purity.”Despite manifesting in the bodies of ants and beetles, buddha na­ture does not become smaller. Therefore, [the sütra] says, “without de­crease.” Despite manifesting as the dharmakàya, buddha nature does not increase. Therefore, it is without becoming full. Why? Because it is beyond thought and expression and thus not within the confines of measurement.Since the dharmadhàtu does not arise in two ways (through karma and afflictions), it is unarisen. Being unarisen, it is without perishing and therefore is unceasing. Since the dharmadhàtu is naturally pure, it is not pure and thus is without purity. Though it is naturally pure, it is not that it becomes impure [through] adventitious afflictions. There­fore, it is pure. Since there is no decrease in the dharmadhàtu through the relinquishment of the factors of afflictiveness, it is without decrease."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"At the time of the increase of purified phenomena, the dharma- dhàtu does not increase.

Moreover, without any result, any actions on the path to attain a result would be pointless.217Tathàgatagarbha as the Àlaya-ConsciousnessGô Lotsâwas GC continues that the explanation of the tathágata heart as the âlaya-consciousness is found in the Lankâvatârasûtra, the Ghana- vyühasütra, the Srîmâlàdevïsütra218 the vajra songs (dohàs), and others.219It should be added here that Paramartha in his rather free translations of the Mahâyânasamgrahabhâsya220 and The Awakening of the Mahâyàna Faith221 which contain passages from the Uttaratantra and RGW , also relates the âlaya-consciousness to the tathágata heart. Ratnamati said that, just as with the tathágata heart, awakening consists of purifying the âlaya-consciousness from its defilements in order to uncover its pure and original nature (like removing dust from a mirror), rather than eliminating it. The Distinction o f the Views by the early Tibetan translator Yeshé Dé222 (eighth century) speaks of buddha nature as “the àlaya:”It is taught that, at the time of the tathágata hearts not having become clearly manifest, it is called “âlaya.” When it has become clearly mani­fest, it is called “dharmakàya.”223Tathàgatagarbha as a Sentient BeingAccording to GC, the explanation of the tathágata heart as a sentient being is found in texts such as the Pradïpoddyotana:All sentient beings are the tathágata heart.224Also, the Uttaratantra contains passages such as:Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o f Tathàgatagarbha 63"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"64 Translators IntroductionThe basic element...Is taught through three names In its three phases.225In addition to these two sources, one may as well add the Hevajratantra's famous verse:Sentient beings are buddhas indeed.However, they are obscured by adventitious stains.Due to the removal of these, no doubt,Beings are definitely buddhas.226Tathâgatagarbha as the Dharmakaya, Suchness, the Disposition, and NonconceptualityGC does not discuss the Uttaratantra's above-mentioned four explanations of the tathagata heart as dharmakaya, suchness, disposition, and noncon­ceptuality further since it says that they are explained in detail throughout the text. However, JKCs introduction (13-14) elaborates on these four ex­planations based on GC s comments on Uttaratantra 1.27 (compare appen­dix 1):Since buddha wisdom enters into the multitudes of beings,Since its stainlessness is nondual by nature,And since the buddha disposition is metaphorically referred to by [the name of] its fruition,All beings are said to possess the buddha [heart].According to Gô Lotsàwa, JKC says, (1) the buddha wisdom that is present in sentient beings is called “tathagata heart” because buddha wisdom enters into all these beings. (2) Since the nature of the mind—suchness without adventitious stains—exists in all buddhas and sentient beings without difference, it is also called “tathagata heart.” (3) The factors similar to a buddha (the skandhas and so on) that exist in sentient beings represent the buddha disposition. Since “disposition” has the meaning of being very similar, this disposition is labeled with the name “tathàgata” and thus explained as the heart of a tathagata.227 Thus, in brief, the tathagata heart is taught to be the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition, respectively. The first one is the actual tathàgata and the nominal heart of sentient beings. The second one is both the actual tathagata and the actual heart because it"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"covers both buddhas and sentient beings. The third one is the actual heart and the nominal tathágata. (4) Nonconceptuality should be understood as applying to all the preceding points (1)—(3) in general.JKC continues that “disposition,” “basic element,” “seed,” and so on, are used as the synonyms of the tathàgata heart. However, “basic element” (1dhàtu) does not have the meaning of “cause” here—it is called “basic ele­ment” because, in terms of not being clearly manifest, it also has the mean­ing of the word garbha (“heart”). This is why a buddha in a decaying lotus and so on are given as the nine examples of this basic element because it is present as the actually existent true nature that is obscured from the outside by obscurations that are something else. The dharmadhàtu too is taught to be the disposition and the basic element.In addition to the above eight different ways of explaining the meaning of tathágatagarbha, note that Uttaratantra 1.23-24 identifies the tathàgata heart as being fourfold: (1) stained suchness, (2) stainless suchness (awak­ening), (3) the qualities of this awakening, and (4) its enlightened activity. Thus, besides being the intrinsic disposition for (or cause of) awakening as well as the result that is awakening, the tathàgata heart is here additionally explained as the buddha qualities and nonconceptual enlightened activity for all beings. Still, these four can be subsumed easily under the above four points of GC—the dharmakàya, suchness, the disposition, and nonconcep­tuality. For suchness is twofold—stained (1) and unstained (2), the disposi­tion is the same as stained suchness (1), the dharmakàya consists of (2)-(4), and nonconceptuality applies to all, but in particular to (4).Tibetan Assertions on TathágatagarbhaAs for the many different ways in which Tibetan scholars explain the mean­ing of tathágatagarbha, only a brief sketch of the main positions in the major Tibetan schools is possible here.According to BA,228 those who follow the tradition of Dsen Kawoché (Tib. Btsan Kha bo che) hold that since the tathàgata heart is the naturally luminous nature of the mind, it is the powerful vital cause of buddhahood. TOK agrees, saying that, according to the Eighth Situpa, the texts in Dsen Kawochés lineage accepted a really established, self-aware, self-luminous cognition empty of the duality of apprehender and apprehended to be the powerful vital cause of buddhahood.229Ngog Lotsâwa (1050-1109) says in his commentary on the Uttaratantra that the basic element or dhàtu is the conventional object that is a nonim­plicative negation.230 He defines this dhàtu as the mind stream that has theDifferent Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 65"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"66 Translators Introductionnature of emptiness and is accomplished through the accumulation of the virtue that is attained from the path of accumulation up through the sev­enth bhümi. Moreover, Ngog equates “dhàtu” not only with the tathagata heart (as in R G W ) but also with the àlaya-consciousness (maybe influ­enced by the Lankâvatàrasütra).2n Obviously, this creates a considerable tension with his definition of the tathagata heart as emptiness, but he does not resolve it (some of his followers, such as Chaba Chôkyi Sengé, thus explicitly reject the identification of the tathagata heart as the âlaya-con­sciousness). BA adds that both Ngog Lotsàwa and his student Dsangnagpa hold the tathàgata heart to be ultimate reality, but for them ultimate reality is not even a mere referent object (zhen yu l), let alone being an object of terms and conceptions.232 On the other hand, Chaba Chôkyi Sengé is said to assert that ultimate reality consists of the nonimplicative negation of all entities’ being empty of real existence and that this negation does serve as a referent object of terms and conceptions. Chaba also states that the teach­ing on the tathàgata heart in the Tathâgatagarbhasütra bears an intention and is not to be taken literally.233The Kadampa tradition, and later the Gelugpa School, generally follow Ngog Lotsàwa in asserting the tathàgata heart as mind’s emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation. However, like Chaba Chôkyi Sengé, Gelugpas usually assert that the teachings on tathàgata heart are of expedient mean­ing. Kedrub Jé Geleg Balsang (1385-1438) says that the tathàgata heart re­fers to the emptiness of mind’s being empty of being really established in its phase of not being free from adventitious stains:In the Mahâyânottaratantra, it is said that the sugata heart and the sugata element are equivalent. In its commentary, it is stated:Here, the meaning of “dhàtu” is the meaning of “cause.”234Therefore, the sugata heart is called “the sugata cause.” [However,] the mere cause of a buddha is not called “sugata heart.” “How is it then?”It is the emptiness of mind’s being empty of being really established that is called “the naturally pure true nature of the mind.” The natu­rally pure true nature of the mind in its phase of not being free from adventitious stains is called “sugata heart” or “naturally abiding dispo­sition.” The naturally pure true nature of the mind in its phase of being free from all adventitious stains without exception is called “svábhá­vikakáya,” “the ultimate reality of cessation,” “the ultimate result of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"freedom,” “the true nature endowed with twofold purity,” or “the dhar­makàya endowed with twofold purity.” The adventitious stains are the afflictive and cognitive obscurations. Therefore, the svàbhàvikakàya is necessarily not the sugata heart because what is free from adventitious stains is necessarily not what is not free from stains. In our own system, though the synonyms “sugata heart” and “svàbhàvikakàya” are uncon­ditioned, nonentities, permanent, eternal, and everlasting, they are not really established.235The similar view of Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen236 (1364-1432) says that the tathàgata heart is the state of a being in whom minds emptiness is ob­scured, while buddhas by definition do not possess this tathàgata heart. Thus, the tathàgata heart as minds emptiness is the cause of buddhahood only in the sense that this emptiness is the focal object of the wisdom of bodhisattvas in meditative equipoise, which is the primary cause of bud­dha wisdom (however, both the wisdoms of bodhisattvas and buddhas are momentary and belong to seeming reality). Thus, the tathàgata heart is only a cause in the sense that the mind stream is purified through focusing on it. Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) himself is quite silent about buddha nature (probably because his champion Candrakirti declared it to be of expedient meaning). In his commentary on the Abhisamayàlamkàra, Tsongkhapa says about the Madhyamaka position on the buddha disposition that both the Abhisamayàlamkàra and the Uttaratantra teach it to be the dharmadhàtu or the nature of phenomena free from anything to be removed or added.237Just as the Gelugpas, The Ornament That Illuminates and Beautifies the Tathàgata Heart,238 by Butôn Rinchen Drub (1290-1364), holds the teach­ings on buddha nature to be of expedient meaning. To that end, he says that the general basis of intention of these teachings is the àlaya-consciousness, while Maitreyas Uttaratantra entails the threefold basis of intention that consists of the dharmakàya, suchness, and the disposition. The purpose of teaching the tathàgata heart is to relinquish the five flaws in Uttaratantra 1.160-67, and the invalidation of the explicit statement is that the tathàgata heart lacks wisdom and all the qualities that are contained in this wisdom because these two (wisdom and qualities) must be produced by the two ac­cumulations of wisdom and merit, respectively, on the path.239 Taking the reverse position of the Gelugpas on this, both Butôn and his student and commentator Dratsépa Rinchen Namgyal (1318-1388) identify the actual tathàgata heart as being solely the final fruition of buddhahood. As the lat­ter says:Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 67"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"68 Translators IntroductionThe fully qualified sugata heart is the dharmakaya of a perfect buddhabut never exists in the great mass of sentient beings.240In his commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra, Butôn says that the nat­urally abiding disposition is nothing but emptiness.241The position of Dôlpopa, Táranátha, and their followers on the tathágata heart differs in almost all regards from everybody else’s (in particular, the Gelugpas, the Sakyapas, and Butôn reject Dôlpopa s interpretation vehe­mently). For Dôlpopa, the teaching on buddha nature is of definitive mean­ing and serves as one of the cornerstones of his Shentong view. He typically describes both buddha nature and the dharmakaya as being ultimately re­ally established, everlasting, eternal, permanent, immutable (therzug), and being beyond dependent origination. He also equates the tathágata heart with “àlaya-wisdom” as opposed to the âlaya-consciousness. In that vein, Dôlpopa makes a sharp distinction between the spheres of ordinary con­sciousness and nondual wisdom as being two separate kingdoms because consciousness is merely seeming and empty of itself, while nondual wis­dom is really established and only empty of other seeming phenomena but not empty of its own nature. The object of consciousness is exclusively samsara and the object of wisdom is exclusively nirvana. Dôlpopa explic­itly declares that the tathágata heart, nondual wisdom, and ultimate reality withstand analysis. In other words, self-emptiness—phenomena’s being empty of a nature of their own—pertains only to conventional reality but not to ultimate reality (the tathágata heart), which is not empty of itself. He also holds that the sixty-four qualities of a perfect buddha exist in a com­plete and unobscured manner at the time of the ground, that is, in ordinary sentient beings. However, as mentioned above, Dôlpopa’s typical Shentong presentation of the tathágata heart, as found in his main work Mountain Dharma, is absent in his commentary on the Uttaratantra.242Virtually all Kagyii masters hold the teaching on buddha nature to be of definitive meaning and deny that the tathágata heart is just sheer empti­ness or a nonimplicative negation. Though the Kagyii approach has certain similarities with Dôlpopa s view, it is generally less absolute than the latter s and shows several significant differences, such as not claiming that the bud­dha qualities exist in their full-blown form even in confused sentient beings and not making such an absolute distinction between the two realities as Dôlpopa does (the exception is Jamgôn Kongtrul Lodrô Tayé, who largely follows Tàranàtha and Dôlpopa but at times blends their positions with the Third Karmapas view).243"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Go Lotsàwas GC summarizes his own position on the tathàgata heart in the Uttaratantra and its relation to the adventitious stains as follows.244 Among the seven vajra points, he says, the basic element is to be explained first for the following reason. The basic element is described as emptiness or suchness and therefore all explanations of the seven vajra points in their ultimate aspects refer to nothing but suchness, merely differing in whether this suchness is pure or not pure of stains. The emptiness explained in the second dharma wheel is the nonimplicative negation of being empty of a nature that is not mixed with any other nature, which is to be realized through inferential valid cognition as its cognitive subject. This emptiness is also described as not having arisen from any causes or conditions at all. In the last dharma wheel, that kind of emptiness applies only to the outer co­coon of adventitious stains, while thereafter the emptiness that represents the tathàgata heart is determined. The tathàgata hearts own essence is not a nonimplicative negation but is the element of basic awareness.245 It is not a direct object of inferential valid cognition but is the object of direct percep­tion. As for its not originating due to causes and conditions, this does not mean that it is absolutely unoriginated. Just as the element of space occurs naturally within its own state, in its own continuum, the basic element does not depend on any changes through having contact with other phenomena.GC continues by saying that also the great Madhyamaka masters assert the sütras of the last dharma wheel as authoritative (tshad ma) and it is not the case that they do not accept the emptiness that represents the tathàgata heart. For Bhàvivekas Prajüâpradïpa says:What was taught [by the Buddha] is mainly dependent origination with the distinctive features of nonarising and so on. Therefore, it is estab­lished that the meaning of this treatise [the Mülamadhyamakakàrikâ] is to teach nonconceptual wisdom, whose object is nectar[like] true re­ality (the nonconceptual ultimate, which is like the stainless autumn sky), in which all reference points without exception are at utter peace, and which is free from being a unity or a multiplicity, peaceful, and to be experienced personally. Though the way of being of the Bhagavàn is true reality, those with bad thoughts do not have confidence in it. Therefore, it is apprehended through the predominance of inference.246In the context of the last dharma wheel, the hotness of fire and so on are used as examples because Nàgàrjunas Bodhicittavivarana states:Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathàgatagarbha 69"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"70 Translators IntroductionJust as sweetness is the nature Of sugar, and hotness that of fire,So the nature of all phenomena Is asserted to be emptiness.247Also, the object of negation of which something is empty is a bit different here from that of the second dharma wheel. The tathágata heart exists from sentient beings up through buddhas as the nature of the mind by way of not being impaired or fabricated by any other conditions, while it is said to be empty of all fabricated adventitious phenomena.Next, GC provides a list of such adventitious phenomena, which in­cludes not only the conventionally unmistaken and mistaken subjects and objects of ordinary beings but also the subjects and objects in the mind streams that represent the spiritual paths of ordinary beings, srávakas, and pratyekabuddhas. Thus, what is adventitious consists of: (1) the direct ap­pearances that are apprehended as blue, yellow, and so on, and consist of the minds being colored in the form of distinct aspects of objects, (2) the aspects that are the apprehenders of these appearances, (3) the aspects that are the objects that appear for conceptions and are produced by the power of the latent tendencies planted by direct appearances, (4) the aspects that are the apprehenders of those objects, (5) the appearances of inference ex­plained in Madhyamaka, (6) the aspects that are the apprehenders of those appearances, (7) the aspects of strands of hair, yellow conch shells, and so on, that are caused by impaired sense faculties, (8) the aspects that are the apprehenders of those, (9) the clear appearances of dreams, (10) the ap­pearances that arise from meditation, such as skeletons and the totalities,248 (11) the appearances of contaminated supernatural knowledges, (12) the appearances of the dhyánas and formless absorptions, (13) the appearances of the objects of srávakas and pratyekabuddhas realizing personal identity- lessness, and (14) the aspects that are the apprehenders of those. Since all of these are fabricated by either objects, latent tendencies, or impaired sense faculties, they are not the mode of being of minds natural state. Therefore, it is said that minds nature is empty of all of them.Still, it is not that these adventitious phenomena arise as something that is apart from the nature of the mind. This is similar to the example of spaces being described as empty because it does not turn into clouds, mountains, and so on, while it is at the same time not tenable for clouds and so on to abide anywhere else than in space. Moreover, since the outer world and the bodies of sentient beings are brought about by ignorance,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"they are fabricated too and thus also represent objects of negation of which the tathàgata heart is empty.The buddhas do not see this element of basic awareness as having any kinds of characteristics whatsoever because the Bodhicittavivarana says:In brief, the buddhasDid not see [mind] nor will they see it.How could they seeWhat has the nature of lacking a nature?What is called “entity” is a conception,The lack of conceptions is emptiness.Wherever conceptions appear,How could there be emptiness?The tathägatas do not see a mindWith the aspects of something to be cognized and what cognizes it. Wherever there is something to be cognized and what cognizes it,There is no awakening.Being without characteristics, without arising,Without abiding, and without words,Space, bodhicitta, and awakeningHave the characteristic of being nondual.249The Madhyäntavibhäga states:In brief, suchness, the true end,Signlessness, the ultimate,And the dharmadhàtuAre the synonyms of emptiness.Since they refer to being changeless, being unmistaken,Being the cessation of [signs], being the sphere of the noble ones,And being the cause of the qualities of the noble ones,These are the respective meanings of those synonyms.250According to Gô Lotsâwa, these synonyms are suitable to be applied to both kinds of emptiness—the one that is a nonimplicative negation and the oneDifferent Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 71"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72 Translator s Introductionthat is basic awareness. He concludes that Maitrlpa, the lord of this dharma (the Uttaratantra), and his successors assert that the emptiness taught in the Madhyamakàvatàra represents middling Madhyamaka, while the emptiness that is basic awareness is the system of supreme Madhyamaka.251The Drugpa Kagyii master Padma Karpo252 (1527-1592) says that the nature of the tathágata heart is threefold—the dharmakàya is the power to accomplish what one wishes for, suchness never changes into anything else, and the disposition means to be moistened through compassion. Since the tathàgata heart is lasting, it is the basis for everything unconditioned that is connected to it and cannot be separated from it as well as everything con­ditioned that is not connected to it and can be separated from it. When this tathàgata heart is not realized, it is suitable to be called “samsàra,” and when it is realized as it is, it is suitable to be called “nirvána.” This is comparable to the existence of space, which can appear as having clouds for some and as being without clouds for others. The adventitious stains, which do not withstand analysis on the level of the correct seeming, are like clouds, while the dharmadhàtu, which withstands being analyzed, is like space. However, to say that the tathàgata heart actually exists in all sentient beings is of ex­pedient meaning. Therefore, it is called “buddha heart” but not “sràvaka heart” and so on. The object that is to be realized is this tathàgata heart alone, but the cognizing subject that realizes it just as it is is solely the vision of buddhas.253In the Karma Kagyii School, it is the Third Karmapas works that are considered to be the most authoritative on buddha nature. In particular, he discusses the tathàgata heart in the first and ninth chapters of his Profound Reality and its autocommentary, his commentary on the Dharmadhâtu­stava, and his Pointing Out the Tathàgata Heart. The Karmapas unique approach to presenting the tathàgata heart is to skillfully combine the teachings of Yogàcàra, Madhyamaka, and the Uttaratantra. The tathàgata heart is minds luminous ultimate nature or nondual wisdom, which is the basis of everything in samsàra and nirvána. Its essence is empty, its nature is lucid, and its display is unimpeded (this is also how the nature of the mind is presented in the Mahàmudrà tradition, and the Karmapa s commentary on the Dharmadhâtustava indeed equates the tathàgata heart with Mahàmudrà).254 Like Padma Karpo, Rangjung Dorje says several times that not realizing this nature of the mind or buddha nature is samsàra, while realizing it is liberation (something that Dolpopa repeatedly rejects at length). The commentary on the Profound Reality by the first Karma Trinlépa, Choglé Namgyal (1456-1539),255 elaborates that, according to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"the Third Karmapa, the tathagata heart is the essence of the inseparability of the naturally luminous dharmadhàtu and personally experienced wis­dom—nothing but ordinary mind, which is free from being real or delusive, like a reflection of the moon in water, and beyond identification and char­acteristics. This is understood as the personally experienced awareness of minds being profound and lucid in a nondual way.The Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhisamayàlamkâra con­tains several uncommon discussions of the tathàgata heart, describing it as the ultimate reality of prajnàpàramità, nondual wisdom, mind’s lumi­nosity, the perfect nature, “the profound other-empty” (shentong), and Mahâmudrâ, which is empty of all imaginary and dependent phenomena of seeming reality. The Karmapa emphasizes that the tathàgata heart is the only ultimately real entity, which is permanent and able to perform functions (such as enlightened activity). He also repeatedly says that the tathàgata heart and sentient beings are mutually exclusive since sentient beings are nothing but the sum of adventitious stains. Thus, sentient beings neither possess nor are the tathàgata heart. This also means that it is not the case that buddha nature exists in sentient beings, but sentient beings (seem to) exist in buddha nature, just like clouds floating in the sky without affecting it.256The Nyingma views on buddha nature are complex.257 From early on, there is a tendency in this school to bring the explanations on the tathàgata heart in line with Dzogchen, starting with Rongsom Chôkyi Sangpo258 (1042-1136), Rog Sherab Ü259 (1166-1244), and Longchen Rabjampa260 (1308-1364). In that regard, Longchenpa, Mipham Rinpoche (1846- 1912), and others state repeatedly that the Dzogchen view accords with *Pràsangika Madhyamaka. Also, no Nyingma scholar ever considered only the last dharma wheel as being of purely definitive meaning while catego­rizing the second one as being of purely expedient meaning. Rather, there is generally a balanced approach to these two cycles of teachings. As Potriil Dongag Denpé Nyima261 (1898-1959) says:Therefore, in the system of Great Madhyamaka, according to the in­tended meaning of sütras such as the Aksayamati[nirdesasütra] and great treatises such as the root text of the [Madhyamakjàvatàra and its commentary, the middle words of the Buddha are asserted as being of definitive meaning. According to the intended meaning of sütras such as the Dhâranïsvararâjafsütra] and great treatises such as the Ut­taratantra, the sütras of the last words of the Buddha that teach theDifferent Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathâgatagarbha 73"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"74 Translators Introduction[tathágata] heart are asserted as being of definitive meaning. The in­tended meanings of [these two combined] as a single essential point without contradiction represents the general [approach of] Nyingma texts.Mipham Rinpoche wrote four texts that discuss the tathágata heart—his commentary on the Uttaratantra,262 The Beacon o f Certainty,26* The Lions Roar o f Shentong,264 and A Synopsis o f the Sugata Heart.265 As Dorji Wang- chuk says, the “official position” of the Nyingma School on buddha na­ture may be said to be spelled out in A Synopsis o f the Sugata Heart. Briefly speaking, Mipham generally describes the tathágata heart as the unity of appearance and emptiness, adopting a view of buddha nature that reflects Longchenpas description of the ground of Dzogchen—the ground of the indivisible ultimate reality that is primordially pure (ka dag) and sponta­neously present (Ihun grub). Mipham also uses reasoning in the tradition of valid cognition to establish the existence of the tathágata heart, similar to his use of reasoning to establish the purity and divine nature of appear­ances in the vajrayána (the latter use of reasoning is a unique feature of the Nyingma tradition, which is said to go back to the works of Rongsom). To that end, Mipham juxtaposes the realm of conceptual mind and the sphere of nonconceptual wisdom, thus integrating an epistemological system of valid cognition with what is completely beyond any conceptions. However, ordinary reasoning is only an expedient means of knowledge, whereas nonconceptual wisdom is the ultimate mode of realization and is said to be present primordially.Pótrül Dongag Denpé Nyima’s view of the tathágata heart, which is largely based on Mipham Rinpoches, is briefly outlined as follows:Thus, the manner of presenting the two realities by means of [the mode of] appearance and [the actual mode of] beings being in accor­dance is as follows. As for the distinctive feature of the sugata heart that is the definitive meaning in the sütras of definitive meaning in the last wheel of the words of the Buddha (such as the ten sütras on the [tathágata] heart), in terms of the aspect of being empty, it has the character of being the object that is the dharmadhátu whose essence is empty and which is endowed with the three doors of liberation. In terms of the aspect of appearance, it is the subject that is the natural lu­minosity of wisdom, which is inseparable from the qualities of knowl­edge, loving-kindness, and power. This is [asserted as] the ultimate in"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathâgatagarbha 75which [the mode of] appearance and [the actual mode of] being are in accordance. The appearances of mistakenness that have the nature of samsara and constitute the aspect of adventitious stains—all subjects and objects that are separable from and do not enter the basic ground of the basic nature—are asserted as the seeming in which [the mode of] appearance and [the actual mode of] being are not in accordance.266Thus, from the point of view of emptiness, buddha nature is the empty dharmadhàtu (the object) and from the point of view of appearance, it is the wisdom (the subject) that is not empty of the inseparable qualities of a buddha. Both these aspects are inseparable and are empty of the adven­titious stains that represent the delusive appearances of samsàra. Interest­ingly but definitely in line with this explanation, Potriil says repeatedly that both the Madhyamakàvatàra and the Uttaratantra are scriptures of “the Great *Pràsafigika Mahàyàna,” though he clearly rejects the Gelugpa un­derstanding of this being the case because, he says, the Gelugpa position is solely based on a nonimplicative negation (the lack of real existence), while completely rejecting the notion of luminosity.267In the early Sakya School, Sakya Pandita268 (1182-1251) identifies the tathàgata heart as being the dharmadhàtu free from all reference points and rejects interpretations of buddha nature as being an entity (be it matter or mind) or a nonentity. Like the Gelugpas and Buton, he asserts the teaching in some sùtras and in the Uttaratantra that buddha nature exists in all sen­tient beings to be of expedient meaning, saying that the basis of intention of this statement is emptiness, the purpose is to relinquish the five flaws in Uttaratantra 1.160-67, and the invalidation of the explicit statement is that if the tathàgata heart really existed, it would be a real entity, be like the self of the tlrthikas, and contradict the sütras of definitive meaning in all respects. He also says that Candraklrti taught it to be of expedient meaning in his Madhyamakàvatàrabhâsya.According to BA,269 Rendawa Shônnu Lodrô270 (1348-1412) first took the Uttaratantra to be a treatise of Mere Mentalism and composed a com­mentary in accordance with that system. However, when Rendawa stayed in solitary retreat later, BA reports that he sung a spontaneous dohà:Therefore, seeing our own mind, this inseparability of being aware and empty,To exist in all sentient beings in a pervasive manner,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"76 Translators IntroductionThrough examples such as a treasure below the earth and the womb of a pregnant woman,[Maitreya] declared that all beings are endowed with the tathágata heart.271Rongton explains that what is called “the tathágata heart” is suchness with stains (the basic element not liberated from the cocoon of the afflictions), which is the emptiness of mind with stains.272 By contrast, the dharmakáya of a tathágata is what is liberated from this cocoon. The term “tathágata heart” is used in terms of what is primary because this heart (in the sense of emptiness) is explained to exist at the time of the fruition too. This also refutes the assertion that the fully qualified tathágata heart is solely the buddhahood that is endowed with twofold purity (natural purity and purity of adventitious stains) because it is explained repeatedly that the primary tathágata heart is suchness with stains. Rongtóns commentary on the Abhisamayalamkara says that the Mádhyamikas identify the disposition as the dharmadhátu specified by the six inner áyatanas.273In the later Sakya School, it is the works of Gorampa Sonam Sengé (1429-1489) that are usually taken to be authoritative.274 According to him, the tathágata heart refers to the nondual unity of minds lucidity and emptiness or awareness and emptiness free from all reference points. It is not mere emptiness because sheer emptiness cannot be the basis of both samsára and nirvána. However, it is not mere lucidity either because this lucidity is a conditioned entity and the tathágata heart is unconditioned. When the unity of lucidity and emptiness is not associated with skillful means, it becomes the basis of samsáric phenomena. Then, out of this unity, improper mental engagement arises, which leads to afflictions, karma, and the skandhas, dhátus, and áyatanas, as described in Uttaratantra 1.55-57. When the unity of lucidity and emptiness is associated with skillful means, it becomes the basis of all phenomena of the path through becoming weary of samsára and striving for nirvána, as explained in Uttaratantra 1.41. Once the unity of lucidity and emptiness has become free from all adventitious stains through the power of having cultivated the path, it is endowed with twofold purity and serves as the basis of all buddha qualities.In his commentary on the Abhisamayalamkara, the contemporary Sakya scholar Ngawang Kunga Wangchug (1921-2008) also emphasizes that the tathágata heart is not just sheer emptiness but the union of lucidity and emptiness.275 In the Mere Mentalist system, he says, the naturally abiding disposition, emptiness, suchness, the true end, signlessness, the ultimate,"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 77and the dharmadhàtu are asserted to be synonyms for the emptiness of the dependent natures being empty of the imaginary nature, which is an emp­tiness that is established as withstanding analysis through reasoning, with all of the above being equivalents. However, in the Madhyamaka system, the sugata heart, the dharmadhàtu, and the naturally abiding disposition are asserted as the unity of lucidity (the bearer of the nature of phenom­ena) and the cessation of all reference points of the four extremes within this very lucidity (the nature of phenomena) being inseparable. On the other hand, emptiness, suchness, and so on, are presented from the point of view of the basic nature that is the cessation of all reference points of real existence or of the four extremes. Therefore, the difference between the sugata heart and suchness or emptiness is very big because suchness is presented as only the empty part of said unity. In brief, in the Madhyamaka system, the naturally abiding disposition must be the dharmadhàtu because it is the cause of the buddhadharmas (such as the ten powers) and because dharmadhàtu, disposition, and cause are equivalents.276As in a lot of other areas, the details of the position of Šákya Chogden277 (1428-1507) on the tathàgata heart differ from Gorampas view, as well as from virtually all other Tibetan presentations of buddha nature.278 Accord­ing to Šákya Chogden, the pàramitàyàna teaches two types of tathàgata heart, as described in the second and third dharma wheels, respectively. The first type is the nonimplicative negation of all extremes of reference points. This tathàgata heart pervades all beings up through buddhas. How­ever, this type of tathàgata heart is not the actual one but only the nominal tathàgata heart. Šákya Chogden says that neither the temporary position on the tathàgata heart (its being a nonimplicative negation) nor the final position (its being inexpressible) of the Nihsvabhàvavàdins provide a cor­rect identification of the tathàgata heart. The third dharma wheel teaches the actual tathàgata heart, which is said to be of two kinds. Some of its sütras explain that the tathàgata heart endowed with all buddha qualities is present in all sentient beings. Other sütras take this statement as bear­ing an intention. Following these latter sütras, Šákya Chogden argues that the basis of the intention of the third dharma wheels teachings on the tathàgata heart is minds natural luminosity free from all extremes of refer­ence points, which is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom and an implicative negation. According to him, this is also what the Uttaratantra says—that the statement of the tathàgata heart’s pervading all sentient be­ings bears an intention and is to be interpreted correctly. He further argues that the Uttaratantra s explanation of the basis of intention in teaching the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"78 Translators Introductiontathagata heart was misunderstood by Tibetan thinkers as an explanation of the actual tathagata heart.279Furthermore, to possess wisdom is not equivalent to possessing the tathagata heart. Though everyone including ordinary beings possesses wis­dom in a nonmanifest manner, only bodhisattvas on the first bhümi on­ward manifest this wisdom as the direct realization of ultimate reality. This means that only such bodhisattvas possess the actual tathagata heart in that they see at least certain degrees of purification of the stains that cover the tathagata heart as well as its inseparability from certain degrees of buddha qualities. Ordinary beings thus do not possess this actual tathagata heart at all, while buddhas possess it in its completeness. In other words, the close connection between seeing the tathagata heart free from adventitious stains and possessing it, as well as between becoming free from adventitious stains and “attaining” the qualities of a buddha, is a prominent feature of Šákya Chogden s interpretation of tathâgatagarbha.In general, he argues against identifying the tathagata heart as a mere natural purity—the state of the natural freedom from obscurations as it is taught in the explicit teachings of the second dharma wheel and their commentaries. In his opinion, the actual tathagata heart has to be asserted not only as natural purity and purity from adventitious stains, but also— and most importantly—as what is inseparable from the buddha qualities. In sum, Šakya Chogden distinguishes three kinds of tathagata hearts: (1) the nominal tathagata heart that is the mere natural purity (as taught in the second dharma wheel and its Madhyamaka commentaries), (2) the actual tathagata heart that is the purity of adventitious stains and represents the relative tathagata heart (as taught in the third dharma wheel and the Non- aspectarian system of Maitreya and Asafiga, as well as in the teachings of expedient meaning in the second dharma wheel as these are interpreted by the third dharma wheel), and (3) the actual tathagata heart that is the nat­ural purity that is inseparable from all buddha qualities and represents the ultimate tathagata heart (as taught in the system of Maitreya and Asafiga and in the third dharma wheel).Consequently, Šakya Chogden criticizes Ngog Lotsàwa and those who follow him for taking the emptiness of mind with stains as the meaning of the tathàgata heart because, he says, the tathàgata heart has to be iden­tified in terms of the buddha qualities, which however is not suitable for a sheer emptiness. He is thus closer to those who explain the tathàgata heart as natural luminosity and nondual wisdom. However, he does not agree with all aspects of that view either because (as explained above) he does not"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"accept that the actual tathágata heart pervades all beings; it exists only in noble bodhisattvas and buddhas. Also, Sákya Chogden speaks of a condi­tioned and an unconditioned as well as a seeming and an ultimate tathága- tagarbha. He holds that even the ultimate tathágata heart is impermanent because it is a functional entity, which is ceasing moment by moment. On the other hand, he says, this does not contradict its being explained as per­manent in other contexts, when having in mind the permanence in terms of continuity.280Elsewhere,281 Sákya Chogden summarizes the main positions on buddha nature in the Tibetan schools as follows:1. Asserting that all sentient beings possess buddha naturea) Asserting buddha nature from the point of view of a nonimplicative negation, which means that it thus is not specified by buddha quali­ties such as the powers (Ngog and his followers)b) Asserting buddha nature from the point of view of an implicative negation, which means that it thus is specified by the buddha quali­ties (Dolpopa and his followers)c) Asserting buddha nature as being sheer natural purity (Gelugpas)d) Asserting buddha nature as the compound of natural purity and buddha qualities being inseparable(1) Asserting those qualities to be the qualities of the fruitional dharmakáya of realization (many Kagyüpas such as Pamo Trupa)(2) Asserting those qualities to be the qualities of the natural dhar­makáya (Bodong Choglé Namgyal,282 1376-1451)2. Asserting that sentient beings do not possess buddha nature (Sakya Pandita, Buton, and others)283In sum, though there are numerous specific differences between the views of all these Tibetan masters, they can be said to fall into two camps—those who assert the tathágata heart as sheer emptiness (be it as the dharmadhátu, the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation) and those who regard it as the union of minds emptiness and luminosity (which includes the buddha qualities). The former typically consider the teaching on buddha nature as being of expedient meaning, while the latter usually regard it as being of definitive meaning.Different Ways o f Explaining the Meaning o/Tathagatagarbha 79"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The History and Transmission of “The Five Dharmas of Maitreya”from India to TibetAmong modern scholars, the authorship of the five texts that the Tibetan tra­dition considers as being composed by the great bodhisattva Maitreya—the Abhisamayalamkara, Mahdydnasutralamkara, Madhyantavibhaga, Dhar- madharmatavibhaga, and Ratnagotravibhaga (Uttaratantra)—continues to be disputed. The main positions include a total denial of a historic person named Maitreya, the author of these texts being someone called Maitreya but not the great bodhisattva Maitreya, and these works being composed by Asanga or other persons. All five texts have been compared in terms of form, terminology, and contents, with some of them (.Mahayanasutralamkara, Madhyantavibhaga, and Dharmadharmatavibhaga) showing greater simi­larities than others (Abhisamayalamkara and Uttaratantra), but it is natu­rally problematic to decide questions of authorship solely on the grounds of such criteria.The Chinese Buddhist tradition also speaks of “the five works of Mai­treya,” but considers them as consisting of the Yogacdrabhumi, a *Yo- gavibhdga,284 the Mahdydnasutralamkara, the Madhyantavibhaga, and the Vajracchedikavydkhya.285 The Abhisamayalamkara was never translated into Chinese and seems to be completely unknown in the Chinese Buddhist tradition. The Dharmadharmatavibhaga was translated only once in 1936 by Fa-tsun (1902-1980) and plays no significant role in Chinese Buddhism, while the Uttaratantra is ascribed to a certain *Saramati.286The designation “the five dharmas of Maitreya”287 in the Tibetan tradition for the above five texts is not of Indian origin and is also unknown in the two earliest catalogues of Tibetan translations from Sanskrit288 (both compiled in the ninth century). Thus, it is hard to say when this expression was used first. However, by the eleventh century, at least some Indian texts consid­ered all the above five texts to be authored by Maitreya.289 Only two among these five were translated during the early translation period in Tibet—the Mahdydnasutralamkara by Gawa Baldse290 and the Madhyantavibhaga by81"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"82 Translators IntroductionYeshé Dé291 (both eighth century). The remaining three were translated during the eleventh century—the Abhisamayàlamkâra, by Ngog Lotsàwa; the Dharmadharmatâvibhâga, by Sengé Gyaltsen292 and Nagtso Lotsàwa, with the latter s being revised by Su Gawé Dorje293 (eleventh century); and the Uttaratantra, by Ngog Lotsàwa and others.294In the different schools of Tibetan Buddhism, there is just about every possible interpretation as to what each one of these five texts by Maitreya teach, what their intentions are, and which of them belong to Yogàcàra or what Tibetans call “Mere Mentalism” (sems tsam), Yogàcàra-Madhyamaka, *Svàtantrika-Madhyamaka, *Pràsangika-Madhyamaka, Shentong Madhya­maka, or “Great Madhyamaka.” However, despite these differences, what is clear for most commentators is that, in terms of their contents, these five texts cover the entire range of the mahàyàna teachings.295There are a number of Kagyü, Jonang, Kadam, Sakya, and Nyingma sources that speak about the transmission of the Maitreya texts.296 Accord­ing to TOK and JKC by Kongtrul Lodrô Tayé, who is known to rely greatly on Tàranàtha, the intention of the sütras of the third dharmacakra was elucidated by the four works of Maitreya except the Abhisamayàlamkâra and by Nàgàrjunas collection of praises. In India, the meaning of these texts was explained and spread widely by Asafiga, Vasubandhu (both fourth century), CandragomI (sixth/seventh century), their followers, Ratnà- karasànti, and others. It is also well known, Kongtrul says, that Dharmapàla (530-561) composed a treatise called Dawn o f Brightness297 that com­mented on Nàgàrjuna s sixfold collection of reasoning and the Mülamadh- yamakakârikà in particular as bearing the intention of the third wheel of dharma.298 However, while the general philosophical system of Maitreyas texts—the contents of the Abhisamayàlamkâra, Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra, and Madhyântavibhàga—was explained in detail through many excellent teaching traditions (such as those of Dignàga and Sthiramati), the uncom­mon philosophical system of these texts was sustained in such a way that only the supreme disciples transmitted it orally, with the texts of the Dhar- madharmatàvibhàga and Uttaratantra being hidden away as treasure texts.According to the historical records of the tradition of Dsen Kawoché (aka Trimé Sherab; born 1021), Kongtrul says, the Dharmadharmatâvibhâga and the Uttaratantra were not known to other panditas in India until the eleventh century,299 when Maitripa rediscovered these texts inside an old stüpa and then received direct instructions on them from Maitreya.300 BA and GC agree with this and add that it seems to be true because the great Indian treatises (such as Haribhadras Abhisamayàlamkàrâlokà) quote the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Histoiy and Transmission o f “The Five Dharmas o f Maitreya* 83Madhyântavibhâga and the Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra but never mention the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga and Uttaratantra. HLS says that Asanga hid his R G W in a stüpa, thinking that this commentary did not fit into the narrow minds of most proponents of Buddhist philosophical systems at the time. Later, Maitripa recovered both the Uttaratantra and R G W from that stüpa and felt great faith in it because he saw that the intention of this treatise was in conformity with the teachings on the heart of the matter by his guru, Savaripa.As for the question whether Maitripa indeed rediscovered the Dharma- dharmatâvibhâga and the Uttaratantra, it is a fact that both texts were al­ready quoted in three works by two teachers of Maitripa. Jnànasrîmitras (c. 980-1040) Sâkârasiddhisâstra mentions the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga by name and quotes what corresponds to lines 24 and 27 in the Tibetan ver­sified version.301 The Sâkârasiddhisâstra also cites a number of verses from the Uttaratantra as well as passages from RGW , and several verses of the same authors Sâkarasamgrahasütra correspond to verses of the Uttaratan­tra.302 Likewise, Ratnàkarasàntis (eleventh century) Sütrasamuccayabhàsya quotes Uttaratantra 1.28 and 1.96-97 and two passages from R G W .303 Though it seems somewhat unlikely that Maitrlpas teachers quoted the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga and Uttaratantra in their texts only after their student had rediscovered them, this is what the above sources suggest.304 The earliest available Tibetan commentaries on the Uttaratantra by Ngog Lotsâwa and a student of Marpa Chôkyi Wangchug (CMW) do not men­tion Maitripa at all. IM as the earliest known record of the rediscovery of the Uttaratantra says that a pandita called Maitreyanàtha retrieved instruc­tions on the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga from a stüpa after he had dreamt about placing instructions on these texts inside a stüpa and then receiving teachings on them by Maitreya.305 It is not clear in IM whether “instructions” refers to the actual manuscripts of these two texts or to instructions about them. However, IM seems to suggest that Maitreya­nàtha only retrieved the instructions in his dream that are contained in IM itself, which are Maitreyas teachings based on the Uttaratantra that he gave in Maitreyanàthas dream. Sâkya Chogden reports that, according to some, a pandita by the name Maitreyanàtha retrieved the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga from a brick stupa just prior to the time of Ngog Lotsâwa. According to others, he says, this bearer of Maitreyas name was in fact Maitripa, and the two texts represent treatises on Mahàmudrà. Rongton says that it was a disciple of Maitripa named *Anaraksita who"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"84 Translators Introductionretrieved the two texts from a four-storied sandalwood stupa and then passed them on to Sajjana and his son Mahájana.In any case, it is clear from the majority of the Tibetan accounts of the transmission lineage (gsanyig) of the Uttaratantra that Maitripa is regarded as a part of this lineage and was taught the text directly by Maitreya.306 These Tibetan records also agree that Maitripa then taught the Dharma- dharmatávibhága and Uttaratantra to pandita *Ánandakírti who, disguised as a beggar, traveled to Kashmir. There he transmitted these texts to the Kashmiri pandita Sajjana (eleventh century), who gave copies to pandita JnanasrI and others.307 Some sources explicitly emphasize how extremely rare the manuscripts of these two texts were at the time of Sajjana.308Sajjana was the elder son of pandita Mahájana and the grandson of the siddha and pandita Ratnavajra, who was an upasaka (holding the vows of a lay practitioner).309 Ratnavajra was the central one among the six gatekeeper panditas of Vikramaslla and there mainly taught the five texts of Maitreya, Dignága s and Dharmaklrtis works on pram dna, and the Buddhist tantras for many years.310 He is also said to have taught Madhyamaka to Parahi- tabhadra311 and Mahamudra to Padampa Sangyé312 (died 1117), the founder of the tradition of The Pacification of Suffering. Upon his return to Kash­mir, Ratnavajra established several centers for the study of the sutra and tantra traditions.313 He also went to Western Tibet, teaching and collabo­rating with the translator Rinchen Sangpo314 (958-1055). At Samyé Ling, he supervised the rebuilding of the central terrace, which was burned in 986. Finally, he went to Uddiyána and attained the rainbow body there. Ratna­vajra composed a number of tantric sádhanas, ritual texts, and praises, as well as the Yuktiprayoga (a short text on valid cognition), and translated the Guhyavajratantra, its Vrtti, and the Gititattva by the siddha Saroruha (all preserved in the Tengyur). In addition, he wrote a still extant, but unfortu­nately unavailable, commentary on the Uttaratantra,315 which should shed considerable light on the interpretation of this text in the particular lineage that was subsequently transmitted into Tibet by Dsen Kawoché.As a possible glimpse into this commentary by Ratnavajra, the Eighth Karmapa316 says that there are three ways of distinguishing what is of ex­pedient and what is of definitive meaning in the three wheels of dharma as presented by the Samdhinirmocanasutra, the Uttaratantra, and Nágárjuna and his followers. According to the Karmapa, Ratnavajra explains the dis­tinction in the Uttaratantra as follows:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The wheel that introduces [beings] to the path of peace is of expedient meaning. The wheel of maturation is the wheel that is predominantly of definitive meaning, but also contains some parts of expedient mean­ing. The wheel of prophecy is the wheel of nothing but the definitive meaning.317As for the works of Sajjana, only three are preserved—a Putralekha (to his son Mahajana),318 a Sutralamkarapindartha,119 and the Mahayanot- taratantrasastropadesa (SM). The latter is the main source for Sajjana’s view on the Uttaratantra (for details, see the description and translation of SM below). The esteem in which he held the Uttaratantra is illustrated by his handing Ngog Lotsawa the folios of the text one by one and saying that if even a single page of this manuscript were lost, it would be equal to the passing away of Maitreya.320 Sajjana obviously stated the same to Dsen Kawoche321 and also to the translator Shama Senge Gyaltsen,322 when Sajjana taught him the Dharmadharmatavibhaga.323 Sajjana s son Mahajana received the transmission of the Maitreya texts from both his father and grandfather. Like Su Gawe Dorje, he was also active in western Tibet, trans­lated Vasubandhus Dharmadharmatavibhagavrtti, and helped in compil­ing the versified version of the Dharmadharmatavibhaga.As for the transmission of the five Maitreya works and the Uttaratan­tra in particular from India to Tibet, there are four known lineages—one through Ngog Lotsawa, two through Dsen Kawoche, and one through Marpa Dopa Chokyi Wangchug. Both Ngog and Dsen traveled to Kashmir and studied the Maitreya works with Sajjana at the same time. Ngog stayed in Kashmir for seventeen years and studied there with six different mas­ters, among them also Parahitabhadra. Ngog composed two commentaries on the Uttaratantra, with the shorter ones being still available. Due to its purely scholarly approach, Ngog’s lineage is often called “the explanatory tradition of the dharma works of Maitreya” (byams chos bshad lugs), while Dsen’s more experiential approach represents “the meditative tradition of the dharma works of Maitreya” {byams chos sgom lugs). CMW in the tra­dition of Marpa Dopa and Parahitabhadra shows both these approaches.Dsen Kawoche was a student of TrapaNgonshe324 (1012-1090) and trav­eled to Kashmir at age fifty-five (1076). When he met Sajjana, he said, “Since I am old now, I won’t study many teachings. However, I wish to make the dharmas of the Bhagavan Maitreya my ‘death dharma.’325 Therefore, please instruct me properly in them.” Upon this request, Sajjana taught him the Maitreya works by relying on the translator Su Gawe Dorje.326 The latterThe History and Transmission o f “The Five Dharmas o f Maitreya* 85"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"86 Translator s Introductionis also said to have written a (now lost) commentary on the Uttaratantra that contained his notes of Sajjanas teachings.327 In Toling in western Ti­bet, Su Gawé Dorje also revised an earlier translation of the prose version of the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga (by Sàntibhadra and Tsültrim Gyalwa).328 Another translator present at the time in Kashmir, called Padma Sengé,329 also received explanations from Sajjana similar to those given to Dsen, and it appears that this Padma Sengé composed an (equally lost) extensive com­mentary on the Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra that contained his notes of Sajja- na’s explanations.Dsen Kawoché and Su Gawé Dorje returned to Tibet before Ngog Lotsâwa. They taught the Maitreya works (in particular, the Dharmadhar­matàvibhàga and Uttaratantra) to many masters in central Tibet. In par­ticular, Dsen transmitted them to a certain Jangrawa.330 The latter taught them to Tarma Dsdndrii (1117-1192) of Chô Dodé Boog,331 who was a lineage holder of The Pacification o f Suffering and composed an extensive commentary on the Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra in several volumes (now lost). Tàranàthas Supplication to the Profound Shentong Madhyamaka332 contin­ues this lineage after Tarma Dsôndrü up to himself with Yeshé Jungné333 (twelfth century), Jangchub Kyab334 and Jangchub Shônnu335 (twelfth/thir­teenth century), Kyotôn Mônlam Tsültrim (1219-1299), Jomden Rigpé Raltri336 (1227-1305), Kyiton Jampéyang Tragpa Gyaltsen337 (thirteenth century), Dôlpopa, Nyaôn Kunga Bal338 (1285-1379), Chôbal Gônpo,339 Lodrô Sangpo Gyatso,340 Tônyô Bal341 (all fourteenth/fifteenth century), Sàkya Chogden (1428-1507), Tônyô Trubpa342 (fifteenth/sixteenth cen­tury), Kunga Drôlcho343 (1507-1565/66), Kunga Gyaltsen344 (sixteenth century), and Tragden Trubpa345 (sixteenth/seventeenth century). An al­ternative gzhan stong lineage from the Buddha is said to run through Vajra- pàni, Ràhulabhadra,- Nàgàrjuna, Savaripa, and Maitripa. After the latter, it continues as above.A supplement to Tàranàthas lineage supplication by the contempo­rary Jonang master Ngawang Lodrô Tragpa (1920-1975) lists the follow­ing names after Tàranàtha:346 Jetsünma Trinlé Wangmo347 (1585?-1668?), Kunga Balsang348 (1629-1686), several unnamed masters in between, Kunga Yônten Gyatso349 (1818-1890), Palden Namnang Dorje,350 Kunga Oser,351 Ngawang Lodrô s own principal guru, Tsognyi Gyatso352 (1880— 1940), and Kunga Tugjé Palsang353 (1925-2000). Tàranàtha states at the end of his supplication that this represents the lineage of the instructions that combine the intention of all sütras of the final wheel of dharma and the commentaries on their intention, while there are distinct lineages for the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The History and Transmission o f “The Five Dharmas o f Maitreya* 87guiding instructions of each one of the five Maitreya texts. Nevertheless, from the texts by Mônlam Tsültrim (who is notably included in the above lineage), it is clear that the tradition of Su Gawé Dorje and Dsen Kawoché, at least with regard to the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatavibhaga, was continued through the Kadampa School and then the Jonang School. Also, the fact that the works by Mônlam Tsültrim were written down by his students, such as Séu Chôkyi Gyaltsen,354 and still exist today shows that a textual tradition based on Dsen s instructions survived.As for how this particular lineage came to Jamgon Kongtrul through the Jonang, Nyingma, and Kagyü schools (previous possible connections between Kadampa and Jonang on the one hand and Nyingma and Kagyü on the other notwithstanding), Kongtrul’s GISM says that, after Tàranàtha, this lineage went through Gyaltsab Nartangpa Lodro Namgyal355 (1618— 1683), Ngawang Trinlé356 (1657-1723), Künsang Wangpo357 (born late six­teenth/early seventeenth century), Gahto TsewangNorbu (1698-1755), the Eighth Situpa, Chôkyi Jungné (1699/1700-1774), the Thirteenth Karmapa, Düdül Dorje358 (1733/1734-1797/1798), and the Ninth Situpa, Pema Ny- injé Wangpo359 (1774-1853), who was Jamgon Kongtruls main guru. The colophon of GISM says that Kongtrul also received Jonang instructions directly from Ngawang Chôpel Gyatso360 (c. 1788-1865) in Dzamtang.361 From Jamgon Kongtrul, all these teachings obviously went to his many students in the Nyingma, Kagyü, and Sakya schools. Among these three schools, the Shentong instructions in this particular lineage are primarily upheld in the Karma Kagyü tradition.Go Lotsawa s BA also mentions an—at least up through his time still existent—anonymous Tibetan commentary on the Uttaratantra that was referred to as “a tïkà on the Uttaratantra in the tradition of Dsen” and sup­plemented its explanations of the Uttaratantra with pith instructions on meditation practice. According to BA, there were also several short texts, such as the Repository o f Wisdom ( Ye shes kyi bzhag sa; this is RW), that contained pith instructions of the Dsen tradition. In addition, BA says that the great Kashmiri pandita Sâkyasrïbhadra (1140s-1225) is reported to have given pith instructions on the five works of Maitreya on Mount Sin- pori362 near Gyantsé,363 but that they do not exist at present (that is, at the end of the fifteenth century).364The third transmission lineage of the Uttaratantra (and probably the other Maitreya texts) is found in Mônlam Tsültrim s IM,365 which says that Dsen Kawoché (referred to by his alias Trimé Sherab) first gave the instruc­tions on this text to someone from southern Ladô,366 who taught them to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"88 Translators IntroductionDopa Nyen.367 Dopa passed them on to Monlarn Tsiiltrim, who in turn transmitted them to Séu Chôkyi Gyaltsen368 in the form of IM. Then, this transmission continued further in the Kadampa lineage.The fourth transmission line of the Uttaratantra and all the other Mai­treya texts reached Tibet via Parahitabhadra and Marpa Dopa Chôkyi Wangchug. Parahitabhadra was a student of the Kashmirian Mahàpandita Somasri and also studied Madhyamaka with Ratnavajra. Parahita- bhadras main Indian student was Mahàsumati, and he also taught Ngog Lotsàwa, Patsab Lotsàwa, Sangkar Lotsàwa Pagpa Sherab369 (a student of Jñánasrlbhadra), Sherab Gyaltsen370 (a student of Atisa), Shônnu Cho,371 Su Gawé Dorje, and Marpa Dopa. Together with these translators, Para- hita translated or revised many sütras, tantras, and treatises (more than twenty works in the Tengyur, among them the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra and the Dharmadharmatâvibhâga). There is also evidence that he collaborated with Sajjana, as their common revision of the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra shows. In addition, the Tengyur contains three works authored by Parahita­bhadra (a Sünyatàsaptativrtti, a Mandalâbhisekavidhi, and a rather exten­sive commentary on the first two verses of the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra). Besides Kashmir, he was active in Toling in western Tibet. It seems that he was more of a Madhyamaka and Pramàna specialist, but there is no doubt that he was a part of the eleventh-century Kashmirian pandita scene that was involved with the Maitreya texts and transmitted them to Tibet (he is also mentioned in one of the Tibetan transmission lineages of the Uttara­tantra).572 In that tradition, CMW, which is based on Parahitabhadra’s in­structions, shows a strong and exclusive Yogàcàra underpinning.According to BA,373 Marpa Dopa Chôkyi Wangchug began his studies under the great Nyingma master Rongsom Chôkyi Sangpo and Korub Lotsàwa Tsültrim Gyalwa.374 Later he proceeded to Nepal and there met Marpa Chôkyi Lodrô, who had just returned from his last journey to India. Upon requesting teachings from Marpa Chôkyi Lodrô, Marpa Dopa was advised by him to receive instructions from the other main disciples of Nàropa since Nàropa himself had entered secret conduct and thus was no longer available. When Marpa Dopa came across a large crowd at Tirhut, he asked what was going on and heard that Nàropa had arrived. He of­fered gold to Nàropa, but Nàropa threw it onto the ground, silently gazed at him with wide-open eyes, and thus blessed him. After arriving in Magadha, Marpa Dopa received the empowerment and instructions of the Cakrasam- varatantra from Nàropas students Manakasrï, Prajñáraksita, Bodhibhadra, and Pramudavajra. Having also heard numerous teachings from other"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The History and Transmission o f uThe Five Dharmas o f Maitreya” 89panditas, he returned to Nepal and there received further instructions on Náropas system from Pamtingpa *Abhayakirti,375 his younger brother Vágísvara, and Kanakasri, as well as many teachings from Vajrapáni (born 1017), one of Maitripa s four main disciples. Primarily with the help of pandita Sumatiklrti, Marpa mainly translated numerous texts related to the Cakrasamvara and VajrayoginI tantras and spread them in Tibet to many students. He also composed detailed commentaries and summaries of both the basic Cakrasamvaratantra and the Yoginisañcárya, thus becoming fa­mous for his contributions to transmitting the teachings on Cakrasamvara. This lineage was continued by Dsangmi Kepa Gyanam,376 Dósewa Loden,377 Jogro Chokyi Gyaltsen378 (who also studied together with Gampopas stu­dent Pamo Trupa379 [1110-1170] at Gyamar in Dolung),380 and others, eventually reaching Butón. Later, one of Gampopas main disciples, Lay- agpa Jangchub Ngódrub, obtained Marpa Dopa s system of Cakrasamvara from Dósewa and composed an extensive commentary based on Gampo- pa s instructions, the basic tantra, and the Yoginisañcárya.Marpa Dopa also collaborated with Sajjana s son Mahájana in translating Ratnavajra3sSricakrasamvarastotra and Sricakrasamvaramandaladevagana- stotra and Sajjanas Putralekha, as well as with Ngog Lotsáwa in translat­ing the Bhagavadáryamañjusrisádhisthánastuti. Also, CMW refers to both Sajjana and Ngog. Thus, Marpa Dopa was definitely familiar with Sajjanas and Ngogs tradition. In addition to having been taught the Uttaratantra by Parahitabhadra, he may even have received teachings on this text and other Maitreya works from one or both of those two and possibly from others among his above teachers. Marpa Dopa s contact with Vajrapáni represents a clear connection between the Mahámudrá lineage and the lineage of the Maitreya texts. Also, Marpa Dopa s closeness to other students of the teach­ers of the more well-known Marpa, the forefather of the Kagyii School, is significant in this regard. It is of course tempting to credit the Mahámudrá- style teachings on the seven vajra points in CMWs introduction to Marpa Dopas contact with Vajrapáni (or Náropas students), but there is no evi­dence for that. As for the continuation of Marpa Dopa s lineage of the Mai­treya texts, BA says that he translated all five of them and later transmitted them to the siddha Nyingpugpa Chokyi Tragpa381 (1094-1186), who also received the Maitreya texts in the tradition of Dsen Kawoché from a certain Jangrawa.382All of this, as well as the existence and the contents of CMW as a com­mentary on the Uttaratantras being transmitted from Parahitabhadra to Marpa Dopa and the latter s students, shows that there was a different"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"90 Translators Introductionlineage of the transmission of all five Maitreya works than those through Sajjana, Ngog Lotsawa, Su Gawé Dorje, and Dsen Kawoché.383In brief, it is clear that Marpa Dopa, having studied with Naropa s and Maitripas disciples and thus sharing crucial sources with Marpa Chôkyi Lodrô, played a significant role in the translation and transmission of tan- tric texts important in the Kagyü tradition.384 He also belonged to the circle of Tibetans around the Kashmiri panditas Sajjana and Parahitabhadra who were the primary Indians instrumental in the transmission of the Maitreya works. Though there is no evidence for Marpa Dopa s having taught early Kagyü masters directly, some of his students had contact with some of Gampopa’s main students. Thus, one may assume that Marpa s teachings were at least one important source for the meditative tradition of the Mai­treya texts in the Kagyü School. Another connection of Gampopa s primary students with this meditative tradition in the line of Dsen Kawoché is prob­ably found in BAs report of Layagpa Jangchub Ngôdrubs having received the Maitreya texts from Jangrawa Durnton.Thus, CMW, as a record of Marpa Dopa s comments on the Uttaratantra based on Parahita s teachings, is of great importance for the early transmis­sion of this text from India to Tibet in general and its meditative tradition in particular. Especially, the introduction of CMW is the earliest available document that clearly represents the meditative approach to the Uttaratan­tra in the style of Mahàmudrà instructions, which is often mentioned and favored in the Kagyü tradition to this day but that—with the exception of GC—finds no clear or detailed expression in the Kagyü commentaries on the Uttaratantra that have been accessible so far.According to BA, GC, and JKC, there were many who wrote commen­taries on the Uttaratantra in the tradition of Ngog Lotsawa, such as Shang Tsépong Chôkyi Lama,385 Trolungpa Lodrô Jungné,386 Nyangtrenpa Chôkyi Yeshé387 (all eleventh century), Chaba Chôkyi Sengé338 (1109-1169), his two students Tenpagpa Mawé Sengé389 and Dsangnagpa Dsôndrü Sengé390 (both born twelfth centuxy), Pagtru Gyaltsen Sangpo391 (1350-1425), and Rongtôn Shéja Günsi (one may well add here later Gelugpa commentar­ies by Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen and others). Despite some of them using slightly different terminologies, all are said to agree with Ngog in explaining the meaning of tathâgatagarbha according to the explanatory tradition of the works of Maitreya.392 Another stream of commentaries (most of them more in line with the meditative tradition of the Uttaratantra) includes those by Dôlpopa, his student Sabsang Mati Panchen393 (1294-1376), and Sangpupa Lodrô Tsungmé394 (mid-thirteenth to mid-fourteenth century)."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The History and Transmission o f “The Five Dharmas o f Maitreya” 91In the Kagyü School, the Third Karmapa (who studied the Uttaratan­tra with Jamyang Sakya Shonnu)395 composed a topical outline of the text (which is embedded in Dashi Ôsers HLS). A student of the Fourth Kar­mapa, Karma Goncho Shonnu396 (born 1333), Gô Lotsàwa, the first Karma Trinlépa, Dümo Dashi Oser (late fifteenth to sixteenth century), and oth­ers wrote more detailed commentaries.397 There also existed a short inter­linear commentary by Surmang Lhalungpa Karma Denpel,39S which was based on the teachings that the Eighth Situpa had received from the Eighth Shamarpa, Chokyi Tondrub399 (1695-1732). Jamgon Kongtruls JKC’s in­troduction says that it primarily follows the Third Karmapa but, except for that introduction, the text is essentially a copy of Dôlpopa s commentary.400"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Mahayanottaratantra (Ratnagotravibhaga) and the RatnagotravibhagavyakhyaTexts and AuthorshipsThe Tibetan and Chinese traditions treat the Uttaratantra and R G W as two distinct texts. Both canons contain separate translations of the “root verses” and the prose commentary together with these verses.401 However, the two available Sanskrit manuscripts of R G W (which include both the verses of the Uttaratantra and the prose commentary) as well as other In­dian sources suggest that the two are simply two elements of the same text. The Sanskrit does not speak of R G W as a commentary on the Uttaratan- tra, and its title is Ratnagotravibhago mahayanottaratantrasastram, thus containing both names. Also, though the title Ratnagotravibhagavyakhya for R G W is used by modern scholars, it is not attested in any Indian text402 (the Tibetan translation in the Tengyur has the title Mahayanottaratan- trasastravyakhya)403 The Chinese tradition calls RGW\" Ratnagotrasastra, while it is almost always referred to as Mahayanottaratantrasastra or sim­ply Uttaratantra in the Indian and Tibetan traditions, as attested by titles such as Sajjanas Mahay anottaratantrasastr op adesa and Vairocanaraksitas Mahayanottaratantratippanu as well as quotes from the text in other In­dian sources. For example, the Sutrasamuccayabhasya404 by RatnakaraSanti (early eleventh century) explains a part of the prose of R G W 405 and explic­itly says that it comes from the Uttaratantra by Maitreya. Likewise, Abhaya- karaguptas Munimatalamkara quotes a prose passage from R G W 406 by saying that it stems from the Uttaratantra authored by Maitreya.The text known as R G W consists of three parts: (1) basic verses, (2) commentarial verses,407 and (3) prose commentary. The commentarial verses explain the basic verses, and the prose commentary glosses all verses (at least in the first chapter). Such a structure is quite rare among Indian works in general. Though Takasaki and other modern scholars agree that R G W is a compilation of different elements and have made attempts to93"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"94 Translators Introductionidentify the “original” core verses of the text, there is no clear solution to isolating such verses.408As for the authorship of the Uttaratantra and RGW , the Sanskrit man­uscripts contain no name of the composer. Beginning with Ngog Lotsàwa s translations of the Uttaratantra and R G W in the Tengyur, the Tibetan tra­dition holds that the former was composed by Maitreya, while the latter was written by Asafiga. The Chinese tradition asserts that both were authored by the elusive figure *Sàramati (though no author is given in the transla­tions or any of the old catalogues).409 In many modern publications, the authorship of the Uttaratantra and R G W continues to be disputed with no definitive outcome, some favoring the Tibetan account and some the Chinese tradition.410 It is noteworthy though that a Khotan-Saka hybrid Sanskrit fragment of the Uttaratantram from the end of the eighth century, which quotes Uttaratantra 1.1, III. 1-8, III. 10, and V3d, refers to the text as the Ratnagotravibhâgasâstra by the bodhisattva Maitreya. Also, as the above references in texts by Ratnákarašánti and Abhayàkaragupta show, from the eleventh century onward in India, it seems that not only the verses but also the prose parts of R G W were ascribed to Maitreya. So far, no attribution of the authorship of R G W to Asafiga has been found in Indian works.412As Kano (2006, 23 and 28-29) points out, from the seventh to tenth cen­turies, there seem to be no Indian texts that quote the Uttaratantra (though some texts discuss the topic of tathâgatagarbha), whereas the work is cited in a significant number of Indian Buddhist texts from the eleventh to thir­teenth century. However, as Kano says, there are two texts that indicate the possibility of the transmission of the Uttaratantra still continuing at least throughout the eighth century—besides the above-mentioned Khotan-Saka fragment, the Sarvatathâgatatattvasamgraha (late seventh to eighth cen­tury) uses terms such as garbha, dhâtu, and ratnagotra in accordance with the Uttaratantra.413 In any case, a Sanskrit manuscript of the Uttaratantra was brought to China by Ratnamati in 508 ce and was translated by him in ca. 511 ce, so the text must have still been available in India in the early sixth century. Takasaki (1966a, 45-54; 1989, 412-15; and 1999) discusses a number of texts from the sixth and seventh centuries that appear to have been influenced by the Uttaratantra. These are the *Buddhagotrasâstra (Taishô 1610), the *Anuttarâsrayasütra (Taishó 669; both translated by Paramàrtha),414 the *Dharmadhâtvavisesasâstara (Taishó 1627), and two Chinese translations of a trikâya chapter in the Suvarnaprabhâsottamasütra (Taishó 664 and 665), which is absent in the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of this sfitra. However, since these texts are available only in the Chinese"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Mahâyânottaratantra 95canon and since the *Buddhagotrasâstra and the *Anuttaràsrayasütra are not unlikely to have been authored by Paramârtha (499-569), it is uncer­tain whether they are indeed translations of actual Indian texts.According to BA,415 there were six translations of the Uttaratantra or R G W into Tibetan. Both texts were translated by: (1) Atisa and Nagtso Lotsâwa Tsültrim Gyalwa416 (1011-1064), (2) Sajjana and Ngog Lotsâwa, (3) Patsab Lotsâwa Nyima Tra417 (born 1055), (4) Marpa Dopa Chokyi Wang- chug, and (5) Yarlung Lotsâwa Tragba Gyaltsen418 (1242-1346). (6) Jonang Lotsâwa Lodrô Bal419 (1299/1300-1353/1355) translated only the Uttara­tantra. YDC420 additionally refers to a translation by Lhotragpa Dharma Sengé.421 At present, only the translation by Ngog Lotsâwa survives in its entirety, while several citations from translations (1), (3), and (6) are found in some Tibetan commentaries at least up through the fifteenth century.422The Meanings of the Titles Ratnagotravibhàga and MahàyànottaratantrasàstraThere is no room here to address the complex treatment of the term gotra in different texts, but its meaning in Yogâcàra texts usually differs from the Uttaratantras primary use of the term as a synonym of buddha nature. Like the Lankàvatàrasütra, the Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra generally refers to gotra as “roots of virtue”423 and speaks of five types of gotra (those of bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, sràvakas, those with uncertain gotra, and those without gotra).424 Following Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra III.4cd and its Bhàsya, the hermeneutical etymology of gotra is often explained as mean­ing gunottàrana, with the syllable go in gotra standing for guna (“qualities”) and the syllable tra representing uttàrana (“delivering,” “setting free”). Thus, the gotra is the disposition from which qualities arise and increase or which sets them free. On Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra III.9 and III.l 1, its Bhàsya comments that accumulating roots of virtue is indispensable for acquiring a disposition, but once the bodhisattva disposition is acquired, it serves as the source of an infinite number of further roots of virtue. Thus, gotra in this sense refers to conditioned and multiple phenomena, whereas gotra in the sense of buddha nature is clearly unconditioned and single. In addition, the distinction between the naturally abiding (prakrtistha) and the accom­plished (samudânïta) or unfolding dispositions in Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra III.4 differs from how these terms are understood in the Uttaratantra. For the Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra defines the former as what has the nature of being a cause or support for further virtue and the latter, as what is thus supported. The former sense is also evident from Sthiramatis (c. 510-570)"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"96 Translator s Introductioncommentary on the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra,425 which says that beings have infinite gotras, all of which refer to some (conventional) nature of theirs, such as being an angry or passionate person, or liking sweet versus other tastes. Just as the possession of the gotra of desire functions as the cause for giving rise to desire but not for hatred, the three different gotras of the three yànas are indispensable for there being three yânas. Further descriptions of the disposition in Yogâcàra texts include “the latent ten­dencies of listening”426 and “the seeds of the supramundane mind” in the Mahâyânasamgraha as well as “the distinctive feature of the six âyatanas” in the Bodhisattvabhümi.The commentaries on the Abhisamayâlamkâra, such as those by Aryavi- muktisena and Haribhadra, generally follow the hermeneutical etymology in the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra but identify gotra as the unconditioned dharmadhâtu or suchness. Based on Indian hermeneutical etymologies, the Tibetan commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra427 by Butôn furthermore explains that, among the nine meanings of go, the ones relevant here are “direction” and “ground” or “earth” (bhümi), while tra(yana) means “pro­tecting.” Thus, the gotra is the disposition because it protects the sentient beings that are contained in the dharmas or bhümis directed toward awak­ening. Or, it refers to kula (“family,” “clan,” or “collection”) in the sense of being the disposition because it merges with the lower realms out of com­passion or because it is the foundation of the collection of qualities. As for its synonyms, Abhayâkaragupta says in his M unimatâlamkâra:The dharmadhâtu, which solely has the defining characteristic of all phenomena’s being without nature, is the cause for the dharmas of the noble ones. Therefore, it is expressed through the synonyms “nat­urally abiding disposition,” “basis,” “reliance,” “cause,” “foundation,” “abode,” “precursor,” “matrix,” “seed,” “dhâtu,” and “nature.”428Go Lotsàwas commentary on the Uttaratantra429 first comments on the general meanings of gotra and its synonyms kula and vamsa.430 As for go­tra, its above-mentioned explanation “setting free qualities” (gunottârana) is said to mean that, through somethings itself being stable and firm, the qualities that are supported by it increase and therefore become transcen­dent. This is like saying that the bodhicitta of those who are endowed with the disposition is stable and firm, while it will deteriorate if the disposi­tion is lacking. Gotra can also mean “what protects qualities” (gunatraya). Or, when go is taken to mean “ground,” it means “what sustains its own"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Mahâyànottaratantra 97ground.” That is, it “sustains” because it distinguishes those with the dispo­sition from others. It is also called gotra because it divides into categories, like calling the generality of cattle “the gotra of cattle.” Kula can also refer to “ground” or “earth,” thus having the meaning of the source from which something arises.431 Vamsa has the meaning of a succession from one to another, thus referring to a continuum.432 In this text here, Go Lotsàwa says, gotra has the meaning of being the source for the arising of the three jewels in the mind stream of a sentient being, thus being their substantial cause. This is also the meaning of tantra because a buddha arises by virtue of the functioning of the basic element of sentient beings as the substantial cause. The three vajra points of awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity are described as the gotra that makes someone attain awakening—they are of similar type, like paternal relatives.In sum, a poetic but still quite literal rendering of the name Ratnago­travibhâga would be “Opening the Jewel Mine.” The title thus contains the analogy of buddha nature as the precious disposition in the minds of all sentient beings that, when “unearthed,” gives rise to, or manifests as, the three jewels of Buddha, dharma, and samgha. However, to use a less mate­rialistic term for this intrinsic mental potential to become a buddha, I chose the translation “jewel disposition.” Unlike in texts such as the Madhyânta- vibhâga and the Dharmadharmatâvibhâga, vibhâga in Ratnagotravibhâga does not mean “distinction” (since there are no two things to be distin­guished) but “analysis” or “critical study.” Thus, more formally, I render Ratnagotravibhâga as “An Analysis of the Jewel Disposition.”As for the meaning of Mahâyânottaratantrasâstra, tantra can mean “con­tinuum,” “doctrine,” “propagation,” “theory,” “model,” “system,” “frame­work,” “principal part,” “main point,” and “section.” Relevant meanings of uttara here include “ultimate,” “higher,” “more excellent,” “predominant,” “later,” “subsequent,” and “concluding.” As Uttaratantra 1.160 explains, the word uttaratantra refers to the teachings on buddha nature as being the latest and also highest teachings of the Buddha, with VT s433 glossing this as uttaragrantha (“latest text” or “latest section”).Similarly, Buton’s Histoiy o f Buddhism says that the Uttaratantra bears its name because it is the supreme one (uttara) within the system or con­tinuum (tantra) of the mahâyàna teachings.434 The word uttara also means “later,” so the Uttaratantra is an exegesis of the latest teachings of the mahàyàna.

Likewise, the Buddha first teaches on impermanence and so on, thus producing weariness in his stu­dents and introducing them to the vinaya. Then, he teaches on the three doors to liberation, thus teaching the guiding principle of the tathagatas. Finally, he teaches the tathagata heart, which resembles the last parts of the medical system and represents the dharma wheel of irreversibility, the discourse on the purity of the three spheres, the single road to travel, the single yana, the single refuge, and the profound dharma not sought from anywhere but the Buddha (compare this with the example of the stages of cleansing a beryl in the Dharanisvarardjasutra quoted in R G W ).436 As for the word uttaratantra, Buton says, uttara means “supreme” and “later,” with the latter meaning applying here. Or, it means “highest” because it is the highest continuum or section (rgyud gong ma) within the mahayana. This is followed by a quote from the Mahaparinirvdnasutra with the same purport, which concludes by saying that the Buddha finally teaches in the last continuum or section (rgyud phyi ma) of his teachings, the one on the tathagata heart, that the tathagata heart is permanent.Gyaltsab Darma Rinchens commentary says that since tantra means “continuous flow” it refers to the scriptures that teach the means to purify the stained mind, while uttara means “later” or “latest,” thus referring to the latest mahayana scriptures.437The commentary by Rongton Sheja Giinsi (1367-1449) also explains that tantra means “continuous flow,” but that this refers to the primary subject matter of this treatise—the tathagata heart—being a continuous flow throughout all phases of the ground, the path, and the fruition.438 Or, the term is similar to tantra in the vajrayana sense: the basic element is similar to the causal tantra; the three conditions that purify the stains of this basic element (the vajra points of awakening, its qualities, and activity), to the method tantra; and the result that consists of the three jewels, to the fruitional tantra (note that this explanation of the term uttaratantra ac­cords more with the nowadays more common understanding of uttaratan­tra as “supreme continuum” in the sense of the changeless continuity of buddha nature itself). “Unsurpassable” (bla ma) means that there is no text higher than it and that it is particularly eminent because it teaches the seven vajra points—the meaning of the sutras of definitive meaning that is dif­ficult to realize.439 Obviously referring to Buton and others, Rongton says that some take uttaratantra to mean “the last section” (rgyudphyi ma) and"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Mahayanottaratantra 99thus explain this treatise to be a commentary on the intention of the last dharma wheel, but that this is not the case because this treatise is also linked to the prajnaparamita sutras and the Saddharmapundarikasutra (referred to in Uttaratantra 11.58), with the latter sutra declaring itself to belong to the second dharma wheel. In sum, Uttaratantra as the title of this treatise signifies both its subject matter and its function.Go Lotsawa s commentary explains that all teachings of the Buddha can be summarized into the three dharma wheels according to the Samdhinir- mocanasutra.44° The Uttaratantra bears its name because it belongs to the last one among these three. In general, uttara means “north” (in terms of di­rection), “supreme” (in terms of qualities), “other” (in terms of substance), and “later” or “subsequent” (in terms of time). Here, it means “later” (with the Tibetan bla ma also being a synonym of “later”). Like Rongton, GC also says that tantra means “continuous flow,” but that it must be understood according to the context. Thus, the term here refers to the continuous pro­cess of progressively guiding a person through the three dharma wheels, with the Uttaratantras being referred to as the last, supreme, or highest stage in that process. This point is also explained in Uttaratantra II.73cd:Therefore, this final stage of the self-arisen ones is not even knownBy the great sages who have obtained the empowerment.Later, GC also explains “continuous flow” as the meaning of tantra as fol­lows.441 Until one attains the first bhumi, samsara is a continuous flow and is thus described as a continuum (tantra). Likewise, the enlightened ac­tivity that is performed from the first bhumi onward for as long as space exists is such a continuous flow, but it is “later” (phyi ma) because it has gone beyond samsara. Even through combining samsara and what is pure, this is still a single continuum because there is a continuous connection in terms of the ones having arisen from the other in that the later one (what is pure) arose from the earlier one (samsara). Thus, what is condensed into one in this way is true reality—the luminous nature of the mind. Since it is obscured by ignorance earlier during the phase of samsara, it is like a secret treasure. Through realizing it, it becomes the continuum of what is pure. How is it a “continuum,” how does it go beyond samsara, and how is it “later”? As for uttara, the Sanskrit tara means “crossing over” and “setting free.” The prefix ud has meanings such as “very” (lhag par), “on” (steng), “later” (phyi ma), and “superior” (rab). Thus, great bodhisattvas first prog­ress to the first bhumi beyond samsara, but even on all ten bhumis, they"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"loo Translators Introductiondo not cross over the ocean that is the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance. When they reach the final bhümi of a buddha, they have even crossed that ocean. If the meaning of this explanation is summarized, it consists of verse 2 of the Dharmadhâtustava:Due to just that being purifiedWhat is such circlings cause,This very purity is then nirvana.Also the dharmakaya is just this.GC says that this principle is truly amazing. For, even through having experienced limitless sufferings in the six realms of samsàra since beginningless time for such a long period, the tathàgata heart did not become rotten. Through its power, the disposition is awakened, great weariness of samsàra arises, and awakening is attained through effort. At that time, it will abide until the end of space as nothing but this basic element of sentient beings, who are just a continuous flow of afflictions and suffering. Furthermore, in terms of the continuum (tantra) that represents the means of expressing all this, the Uttaratantra teaches the meaning of all yànas, but its primary meaning consists of the later or ultimate (bla mo) dharma wheel.Jamgon Kongtruls JKC says that the Uttaratantra is the highest of all dharmas taught by the Buddha, being the unsurpassable one or the peak of the mahàyàna scriptures.442 It is the commentary on the intention of teach­ing the heart of the matter, the lion s roar of irreversibility, thus being the king of all treatises. In general, the all-pervading dharmadhàtu—nondual wisdom—is the nature of the disposition. This dharmadhàtus being en­dowed with the twofold purity of having relinquished the two obscurations is the nature of the dharmakàya. The means to attain this dharmakàya— the view of being free from all reference points and nonconceptual med­itation—is the nature of the path. The well-spoken words of the perfect Buddha that teach these three (the disposition, the dharmakàya, and the path) represent the ultimate or supreme scriptures (gzhung bla ma'am dam pa). When these scriptures are analyzed finely, they are threefold. The first one, the actual ultimate scriptures, consists of the aspects of speech that are the mahàyàna scriptures, which are simply a subdivision of the melodious speech that appears for the buddhas themselves—their nondual wisdom that can arise as all kinds of aspects. This is of the same nature as natural purity or the result of freedom that is the dharmakàya. The second kind of"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Mahayanottaratantra 101scripture consists of the mahayana scriptures in the form of the collections of names, words, and letters that appear as the aspects of term generalities in the minds of noble ones and ordinary beings. The third kind of scrip­ture consists of the words and terms that are expressed as actual speech in accordance with the former two kinds and are called “the scriptures that represent the continuum or section (rgyud) of the mahayana sutras of definitive meaning.” The latter two kinds of ultimate scriptures are very different in nature from the triad of nature, fruition, and path. However, since they arose from the aspiration prayers of a buddha, represent the nat­ural outflow of the dharmakaya, and have the power to relinquish the two obscurations, one should understand that they are included in the uncon­taminated dharmas of a buddha, the focal object for purification, and the perfect nature. Elsewhere,443 JKC says that, similar to the tantras (rgyud), the final dharma wheel explains the ultimate actuality because it teaches the continuous (rgyun mi chad pa) dharmadhatu.Unlike most other commentaries, CMW explains that tantra here is to be understood in its vajrayana sense since the Uttaratantra resembles a tan­tra in two ways. Thus, the text is clearly regarded as a bridge between the sutrayana and the vajrayana:A tantra is a tantra in the sense of being concealed, hidden, or secret, that is, it is presented [as “tantra”] by keeping it secret from those who are not [proper] vessels. Likewise, if this treatise is taught to those who are not [proper] vessels (those who have the dispositions of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and those with the cut-off disposition), fear will arise [in them]. Therefore, it is presented by keeping it hidden or secret from them. Or, in tantra there is the triad of causal tantra, fruitional tantra, and method tantra. Likewise, in this treatise, what resembles the causal tantra is the basic element. What resembles the method tantra are the means to purify this [basic element]—awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity. What resembles the fruitional tantra are the three jewels.444Yeshe Dorjes commentary YDC combines the above explanations with what CMW says, beginning by saying that tantra means “something that is continuous” (rgyun chagspa), which is twofold—the continuum of samsara and the continuum of nirvana.445 Since the tantra in question here is the supreme or later continuum, it is called “the ultimate continuum” or “the later continuum.” As the Vajrasikharatantra says:"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"102 Translators IntroductionTantra is called “something that is continuous”—Samsàra is to be expressed as a continuum.What is called “the later” is the yonder side—The later continuum is nirvàna.“Tantra” in the sense of the meaning that is to be expressed is threefold- causal tantra, fruitional tantra, and method tantra. (1) The causal tantra is what is continuous as the naturally luminous basic nature of phenomena since beginningless time, which is the meaning of “sugata heart” or “primordial buddha.” It is also called “nature” or “aspect.” YDC quotes a text called Man ngagsnye ma as saying that the essence of the emptiness of entities means nothing other than this “nature” or “aspect.” It is a cause— the substantial agent that is the causal Vajradhara. Through it, there is the buddhahood that is established by nature and is not tainted by the stains of beginningless latent tendencies. This is the meaning of “the cause of the buddhahood that is characterized by nothing but this causal tantra s having attained stainlessness.” Therefore, all omniscient mighty scholars say that it is not the intention of the tantra collection to explain the meaning of the causal tantra as being the àlaya-consciousness. (2) The fruitional tantra is what is continuous as the buddhakàya and its enlightened activity, which is nothing but the causal tantra free from adventitious stains. (3) The method tantra represents the methods to manifest the causal and fruitional tantras, which is the continuous path. One may think that since this is the vajrayâna s manner of explaining tantra, it is unrelated to this context here. This is not the case for the following reasons. The three tantras represent ground, path, and fruition, with the causal and fruitional tantras respectively representing the dhàtu in its phase of being impure and the awakening that is the phase of this very dhàtus having become free from stains. Therefore, there is no difference in meaning.446 Also, one must explain the meaning of the explicitly appearing term “tantra” in the name Uttaratantra. “Tantra” in the sense of the words that are the means to express this meaning consists of the texts that teach the three tantras just described. Therefore, the last turning of the wheel of dharma and the commentaries on its intention are also called “the ultimate continuum,” which is evident from Uttaratantra I.160b.Mipham Rinpoches commentary says that “tantra” here refers to the continuity of the tathàgata heart (the main topic of the Uttaratantra) throughout ground, path, and fruition.447 Or, this text is similar to a tantra because the basic element resembles the causal tantra; the three conditions"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Mahayanottaratantra 103that purify it from stains (such as awakening), the method tantra; and the three jewels, the fruitional tantra. “Ultimate” means unsurpassable and most eminent because the text teaches the seven vajra points—the meaning of the sutras of definitive meaning that is difficult to realize.In an attempt to accommodate all these explanations of uttaratantra, I chose the rendering “ultimate continuum,” with the English word “ul­timate”—like uttara—being understandable as both “latest” and “su­preme.”448 Thus, the Mahayanottaratantrasastra is “A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana.”449"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with YogacaraBoth the Uttaratantra and RGVV exhibit a significant number of typical Yogâcâra terms and templates.

Furthermore, RGVV quotes two verses from the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra (among them the only one in the latter text that contains the term tathâgatagarbha), a pas­sage from the Bodhisattvabhùmi on the disposition,459 two verses from the Abhidharmamahâyânasütra, and the above-mentioned passage from the Sünyatânâmamahâsütra (or Cülasunnatasutta) that is also found in several Yogâcâra texts:Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere, the [latter] is empty of the [former].

This presentation greatly resembles the explanation of the same six topics in the context of the fifth vajra point in the Uttaratantra, though some of the same contents are presented under different topics. First, Mahdydnasutralamkara IX.56 defines (1) the nature of this uncontaminated dharmadhatu:It has the characteristic of the suchness of all phenomena’s Being pure of the two obscurations.It [also] has the characteristic of the inexhaustible mastery Over the wisdom of the real and [the wisdom] whose object that is.According to Vasubandhus Mahdyanasutralamkdrabhasya,462 the nature of the dharmadhatu is thus twofold—suchness free from afflictive and cognitive obscurations as well as inexhaustible mastery over twofold wisdom. Sthiramatis Sutrdlamkdravrttibhasya explains that the suchness of all conditioned, unconditioned, contaminated, and uncontaminated phenomena refers to emptiness.463 The suchness that is the emptiness of the buddhabhumi has the characteristic and nature of being free from both the afflictive and cognitive obstructions. This is the fundamental change of suchness. “The wisdom of the real” (vastujhana) refers to the pure mundane wisdom that is attained subsequently to this fundamental change, while “the real” (vastu) refers to the nonconceptual wisdom that is the characteristic of the fundamental change of the alaya-consciousness (the dependent nature). This describes the fundamental change of the alaya- consciousness, which is the support for the impregnations of negative tendencies. The word “that” in the last line refers to the dharmadhatu, which means that nonconceptual wisdom focuses on the dharmadhatu. This describes the fundamental change of the path. Through the pure mundane wisdom of subsequent attainment focusing on nonconceptual wisdom, inexhaustible mastery is attained, because this pure mundane wisdom realizes the nature of nonconceptual wisdom in an unmistaken manner. Also, nonconceptual wisdom attains inexhaustible mastery over suchness—the dharmadhatu—because nonconceptual wisdom settles one- pointedly on or in the dharmadhatu.464Next, verse IX.57 explains (2) the cause and (3) the fruition of realizing this pure dharmadhatu:The cultivation of the knowledge of suchness In all respects [leads to] full realization,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogacara 107Whose fruition is the inexhaustibility of the two Provisions for all sentient beings in all aspects.According to Sthiramati,465 the first two lines explain the cause. “In all respects” means that, through cultivating the progression of listening to, reflecting on, and meditating on the synonyms of the dharmadhàtu (such as “nonarising”) in the mahâyàna sütras on the level of preparation, the wisdom of knowing suchness arises on the path of seeing. This means that the nonconceptual wisdom of realizing the omnipresence of the dharmadhàtu arises. Then, through cultivating that very wisdom from the second through the tenth bhümis, the full realization of the pure dharmadhàtu will arise on the buddhabhümi. As for the fruition, “in all aspects” means either “at all times” or “through all aspects of benefit and happiness.” “The two provisions” are the provisions of benefit (establishing beings in the higher realms and nirvàna in later lives) and happiness (causing them to engage in virtue through benefiting them through material goods in this life). “Inexhaustibility” refers to the uninterruptedness of such benefit and happiness until the end of samsàra.Verse IX.58 describes (4) the function (or activity) and (5) the endow­ment of the pure dharmadhàtu:It entails the activity of the means for employing Emanations of body, speech, and mind.It is endowed with the doors of samàdhi and dhàranl,As well as the two that are immeasurable.Sthiramati says that each one of the activities of the means for employing emanations of body, speech, and mind is twofold (associated with buddhas themselves and others).466 In terms of the body, this activity consists of buddhas themselves displaying as the physical forms of gods, nàgas, and so on, as well as blessing others to appear as buddhas and bodhisattvas. In terms of speech, such activity refers to buddhas’ teaching the dharma through the sixty aspects of their melodious speech and, through their blessing, causing sounds that explain the dharma to come forth from space, walls, trees, and so on. In terms of mind, this activity consists of buddhas’ realizing the profound actuality of the dharma through the blessing of wisdom and, through their blessing others, making even the minds of fools realize the profound dharma, causing noble sràvakas like Sàriputra and Subhüti to explain prajnàpàramità, and so on. “Emanations” refers to"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"io8 Translator s Introductionmaturing sentient beings through these three kinds of activities, which are “means” because activity refers to understanding how to use such means. The last two lines teach that the dharmadhatu is endowed with mahayana samadhis such as the Sky Treasure and the Heroic Stride,467 dharanls such as the Dharan! of the Inexhaustible Casket and the Dharan! of Infinite Gates, and the two immeasurable accumulations of merit and wisdom.468Finally, verse IX.59 explains (6) the manifestation of the pure dharmadhatu:The purity of the dharmadhatuOf the buddhas is explainedAs the different manifestations asIts nature, dharma enjoyment, and emanation.Sthiramati comments that buddhas engage in the welfare of sentient beings through three kayas.469 “The natural kaya (svabhavikakaya)” refers to the dharmakaya, meaning that the nature of buddhahood is the pure dharmadhatu. When the stains of apprehender and apprehended that exist in the alaya-consciousness have been relinquished, this is the fundamental change of the dharmadhatu into mirrorlike wisdom, which is called “dharmakaya.” The sambhogakaya refers to the fundamental change of the afflicted mind into the wisdom of equality and the fundamental change of the mental consciousness into discriminating wisdom. This is called “sambhogakaya” because it provides the great enjoyment of the dharma for bodhisattvas on the bhumis. The nirmanakaya represents the fundamental change of the five sense consciousnesses into all-accomplishing wisdom. It demonstrates the twelve deeds of a buddha and brings sentient beings to maturity. Among these three kayas, the dharmakaya is the foundation or support of the other two.470In sum, Sthiramati says, the completion of having cultivated all kinds of dharmas through the full maturation of the latent tendencies of listening by virtue of the samadhi of the buddhabhumi serves as the cause of the completely pure dharmadhatu, which is devoid of all afflictive and cog­nitive obscurations (its nature). This pure dharmadhatu is endowed with infinite samadhis, dharanls, and the accumulations of merit and wisdom in order to always provide benefit and happiness for all sentient beings (the fruition). In general terms, this dharmadhatu is the suchness of all phe­nomena, the nature of unmistakenness, the cause for the arising of all qual­ities of the noble ones, and the very character of all tathagatas."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogacara 109Mahâyânasamgraha X.27 says that the dharmakaya is endowed with the six qualities of nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment, and manifes­tation.471 In due order, these qualities consist of (1) having accomplished ultimate reality, (2) having gone through all the bhùmis, (3) having found preeminence among all sentient beings (that is, omniscience), (4) being the liberator of all sentient beings, (5) being endowed with inexhaustible and unequaled qualities, and (6) being visible in the worlds and amid the reti­nues by way of the nirmànakàya and sambhogakàya but being completely invisible as the dharmakàya, even by gods and humans.472In addition, these six topics with several instances each are listed in the Abhidharmasamuccaya as constituting “the ascertainment of meaning,” one of the seven methods for ascertaining a topic of discussion.473 Like­wise, the Abhidharmasamuccayavyâkhyâ says that its own first two opening verses teach the six topics of nature and so on as pertaining to the perfect Buddha.474 The six are also listed in the Yogàcàrabhümi,475 though only in a brief discussion of grammar without further explanation.476Thus, given the chronology and contents of these Yogàcàra texts and the Uttaratantra, as well as the fact that R G W quotes the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra, it is most likely that the explanation of the first six topics of the fifth vajra point (and, to some extent, of the fourth vajra point) in both the Uttaratantra and R G W relies on the presentation of these six topics in the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra.Furthermore, the teachings on the tathàgata heart in the Uttaratantra and R G W are clearly based on and use the notion of “minds natural lu­minosity,” which is only superficially obscured by adventitious stains but never in its essence.477 This notion is found in many Buddhist scriptures, beginning with the Añguttara Nikâya and Samyutta Nikâya, but particu­larly in Yogàcàra texts.478 For example, Madhyântavibhâga 1.1 and 1.13 ex­plain emptiness in a positive manner as being an existent remainder after the imaginary duality of apprehender and apprehended has been cleared away. Furthermore, the Madhyântavibhâga describes emptiness as mind’s natural luminosity that in its essence is never obscured by adventitious stains but remains untainted throughout. Madhyântavibhâga 1.16 says:Afflicted and purified phenomenaRepresent its being with stains and without stains.Purity is asserted to be like the purityOf the element of water, gold, and space."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"no Translators IntroductionSthiramati’s commentary on this verse explains that it is in dependence on emptiness’s not having or having undergone the fundamental change that one speaks of being associated with stains or having relinquished these stains.479 Through the flaws of noncognition and wrong cognition, ordinary beings cling to apprehender and apprehended, and their mind streams thus become stained through the afflictions, while emptiness does not appear in them. In the noble ones who lack mistaken states of mind due to realizing true reality, emptiness appears in an uninterrupted manner like a spotless clear sky. Thus, emptiness is to be regarded as being (temporarily) dependent on being afflicted and being pure, but its essence is not stained because it is natural luminosity. Sthiramati brings up the same objection as does Vasubandhu (see below) in his Dharmadharmatavibhagavrtti— that emptiness first being afflicted and then becoming pure must entail a change in it, which would make it impermanent. Sthiramati answers that there is a change only insofar as the phase of emptiness being afflicted changes into the phase of its being without afflictions, but the nature of emptiness itself does not change since it always remains as the ultimate true reality and only becomes free from adventitious stains. In that, emptiness resembles water, gold, and space, which do not have the nature of what stains them and never change, no matter whether they are associated with such adventitious stains or become free from them. In fact, both emptiness’s being associated with stains and its becoming free from them are nothing but adventitious events since emptiness’s own nature is completely unaffected by either one.Madhyantavibhaga 1.21-22 reaffirms the seeming states of bondage in samsara due to emptiness’s appearing to be afflicted and liberation from samsara due to emptiness’s appearing to be pure. However, in its essence, emptiness is never afflicted or pure but is mind’s natural luminosity:If it were not afflicted,All beings would be liberated.If it did not become pure,Efforts would be fruitless.It is neither afflicted nor nonafflictedAnd neither pure nor impureBecause of minds luminosityAnd the adventitiousness of the afflictions."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"As for emptinesss being afflicted and impure in ordinary beings and nonafflicted and pure in the noble ones, Sthiramati comments that emptiness is actually neither afflicted nor impure, which refers to its natural purity, and that the two words “afflicted” and “impure” just serve to emphasize that this natural purity is only associated with adventitious afflictions.480 He refers to Vasubandhu’s quote from the scriptures, which says that emptiness is pure “because of mind’s natural luminosity,” and continues that “mind” here refers to the true nature of the mind (cittadharmatà). That it is neither nonafflicted nor pure again highlights that it is only afflicted by virtue of adventitious stains but not afflicted in its nature. The scriptural support is the phrase “because of being afflicted by adventitious afflictions.” In sum, emptiness is described here as being far beyond just the mere absence of duality in false imagination—it is the ultimate, luminous, and pure nature of the mind.Sthiramati’s Sütrâlamkàravrttibhàsya on Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra IX.22 also explains that emptiness has the nature of both emptiness and natural luminosity at the time of being a sentient being and has that very same nature of both emptiness and natural luminosity at the time of having be­come a perfect buddha.481 Therefore, there is no difference in its nature of purity. Since there is nothing to purify in it, it is actually without purity. Still, at the time of having become a buddha later, it has become pure of the adventitious stains of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations through the power of having cultivated the path. Therefore, it is said that it is not impure either.In addition to the Madhyàntavibhâga and its commentaries, the examples of space, gold, and water appear in many other Yogàcàra texts in order to illus­trate the changelessness of mind’s natural luminosity and its being unaffected by adventitious stains, such as in the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga (lines 299- 300), Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra XI. 13 and XIII. 18-19, Vasubandhu’s Dharma- dharmatàvibhâgavrtti482 and Mahâyânasütrâlamkârabhàsya,483 Sthiramati’s Sütrâlamkàravrttibhàsya,484 the Viniscayasamgrahani,485 the Satasâhasrikà- pancavimsatisàhasrikâstàdasasàhasrikâprajnâpàramitàbrhattîkà486 and the Bhagavatyàmnàyànusàrinï,487 Similarly, Uttaratantra 1.30-31 uses the ex­amples of space, a wish-fulfilling jewel, and water to illustrate the tathagata heart’s changelessness, its power, and the moisture of its compassion.According to GC,488 the section of the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga on the nature of phenomena represents a commentary on awakening—the fifth vajra point of the Uttaratantra.489 The reasons for this are that “stainlessThe Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogâcâra m"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"112 Translators Introductionsuchness” in the Uttaratantra corresponds to “the nature of phenomena” in the Dharmadharmatavibhaga, with both texts explaining that stainless suchness consists of the fundamental change whose cause is nonconcep- tual wisdom. The conclusion of GC’s comments on the Dharmadhar- matavibhaga states that the distinction between the existent nature of phenomena (suchness or mind’s luminosity) and nonexistent phenomena in this text matches the explanation in the Uttaratantra that the ultimately existent tathagata heart is empty of adventitious stains but not empty of buddha qualities.490 Note that this implies that the section on phenomena in the Dharmadharmatavibhaga represents a commentary on the adventi­tious stains in the Uttaratantra. Consequently, the contents of the Dhar- madharmatavibhaga and the Uttaratantra in their entirety are very closely related. In both texts, what is called “the fundamental change” indicates a primordial ultimate that is described in positive terms and is revealed by eliminating ultimately nonexistent adventitious stains. This is illustrated in both texts by the three examples of primordially pure space, gold (or a wish-fulfilling jewel), and water, all of which only need to be discovered by removing adventitious stains but do not need to be newly created or altered. Vasubandhu’s explanation of these three examples in his Dharma- dharmatavibhagavrtti spells this out very clearly:“When something has undergone this fundamental change, it has changed into something else. Consequently, how is what has under­gone the fundamental change not something that is altered?” There­fore, [Maitreya] says that the manner in which there is a fundamental change without its referring to something that is altered is established through examples. Examples for the fundamental change are space, gold, water, and so on. For example, space is [always] nothing but pure by nature. It is only by virtue of its being associated with adventitious fog and so on that this [purity] is not realized, but it is [seen to be] pure by virtue of [eventually] becoming free from such [adventitious obscu­rations]. Since it is not the case that impure [space] becomes pure, it is not that its being pure arises [newly]. Rather, it is just that [its purity] is observed by virtue of its being free from causes for not observing it. It is also not that one should claim space to be something that is altered through its being observed as being utterly pure ...In the same way, in the fundamental change too, natural luminosity is not something that did not exist before, but it does just not appear by virtue of adventitious stains’ appearing. This is just as with [space, gold,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogàcàra 113and water, respectively, appearing] to be impure, not immaculate, and turbid. By virtue of being free from these [adventitious stains], [natural luminosity] appears. However, it is not that it arises, in such a way that it has not been present [before], by virtue of the appearance of an alter­ation due to the nature of phenomena’s entailing [such an] alteration. Since there is no such [alteration], the nature of phenomena and the fundamental change that is constituted by it are permanent.491Similar to Uttaratantra I.37cd, Mahdydnasütrdlamkára IX.23 designates buddhahood as “the supreme self that is the lack of self’:In pure emptiness, buddhas attain The supreme self of no-self.Through attaining the pure self,They have gone to the great self of the self.Sthiramati’s commentary explains that to attain the supreme self means to attain the supreme lack of self.492 The supreme lack of self consists of personal identitylessness and phenomenal identitylessness. Since the buddhas have this twofold lack of a self as their self and their nature within the uncontaminated dhátu, they are presented as being the supreme self. As for the word “self’ (atm an), on the one hand, it means the imaginary self of the tlrthikas, being equivalent to “sentient being,” “life-force,” and so on. But on the other hand, it can also refer to the nature of a phenomenon, such as saying that the defining characteristic or nature of fire is to be hot. In these cases, the word “self’ is used in the sense of “nature” (svabhava). Thus, because the buddhas have the nature of the lack of self, it is said that they have attained the supreme self. So, what is the supreme lack of self? It means pure emptiness. Once the emptiness that is personal and phenomenal identitylessness has become pure of the stains of apprehender and apprehended, emptiness is pure. Having attained this purity is called “having attained the supreme lack of self.” “The great self of the self’ (atmamahatmata) designates the incomparable nature of this supreme self that is the supreme lack of self, which consists of the twofold identitylessness of persons and phenomena. In terms of exactly this being the very nature of buddhas, it is called “the self of the buddhas.”493As for templates in terms of style, the Uttaratantms peculiar and rare approach of expressing the same content twice, with the second time’s"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"ii4 Translators Introductionbeing in a more complex meter, is also found in the ninth chapter of the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra.Finally, as Mathes (2008a, 14-15) points out, the first three introductory verses of the Uttaratantra suggest that its author was familiar with and used the five principles of Yogâcâra hermeneutics (as opposed to Madhyamaka hermeneutics) as laid out in a famous stanza in Vasubandhu’s Vyâkhyâyukti:Those who relate the meaning of the sütrasShould state (1) their purpose, (2) their topical summary,(3) The meaning of the words, (4) their coherence,And (5) the rebuttal of objections.494Among these five principles, (2) the topical summary of the Uttaratantra obviously consists of listing the seven vajra points in 1.1, while (4) the coherence or connection between them is clearly identified in 1.3 (and also, in a different way, in 1.23 and 1.26).495 Uttaratantra 1.156 presents an objection to the teachings on the tathâgata heart, and both (5) the rebuttal of this objection and (1) the purpose of these teachings are found inI.157-67.496 (3) The meaning of the words is referred to in a brief formin Uttaratantra 1.2 and in detail consists of the entire remaining text. Ifit is thus the hermeneutics of the Yogâcâra School that is followed in the Uttaratantra, unlike in Madhyamaka hermeneutics, the mentioning of a purpose does not at all imply that this text is of expedient meaning.497 Rather, as the rebuttal of the objection in 1.158-60 shows, being empty of real existence is understood to apply only to what the Uttaratantra categorizes as adventitious stains, while the tathâgata heart does exist ultimately and is unaffected by these stains. Consequently, even though the tathâgatagarbha teachings are difficult to realize even for bodhisattvas on the bhümis, the Uttaratantra deems it necessary to make it clear already to beginners that the prajnâpàramità teachings on all phenomena’s being emptiness are of expedient meaning and are superseded by the teachings on the tathâgata heart, which are of definitive meaning and are necessary to overcome the five flaws of faintheartedness, contempt for inferior beings, clinging to what is unreal, deprecating what is ultimately real, and excessive self-cherishing. At least some of these flaws cannot be redressed merely by understanding emptiness or may even be caused by misunderstanding it or clinging to it.498 It is important to see that the Uttaratantras purpose in relinquishing these five flaws does not constitute a total rejection of the teachings on emptiness or the Madhyamaka system but rather seems to be"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogàcàra 115aimed at how emptiness is to be properly understood and applied in terms of seeming and ultimate reality in the context of actually practicing this emptiness on the path to becoming a buddha.Despite all these Yogacara elements, the Uttaratantra and R G W ob­viously do not mention major Yogàcàra hallmarks such as the imaginary, dependent, and perfect natures, the àlaya-consciousness, and cittamàtra. Also, the sütra sources presented in the Uttaratantra and R G W do not include any typical Yogàcàra sütras,499 such as the Samdhinirmocanasütra or the Lankâvatârasütra.It should also be noted that the notion of tathâgatagarbha does not ex­plicitly appear in any other Maitreya texts besides the Uttaratantra and the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra,500 nor is it found in any of Asafiga’s or Vasuban­dhu s own texts. It appears only a very few times in other classical Yogàcàra texts, such as some commentaries by Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, and Asva- bhàva (sixth century) on some of the texts by Maitreya and Asafiga. In all these cases, however, tathâgatagarbha is treated only very briefly and is con­sistently explained as suchness in the sense of identitylessness.For example, Vasubandhus very brief comment in his Bhâsya on Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra IX.37 states that all beings are said to possess the tathàgata heart because suchness is the same in all beings and a tathàgata has the nature of pure suchness.501 This conforms to the same authors Mahâyânasamgrahabhâsya on “natural purity” in Mahâyânasamgraha11.26,502 which says that, inasmuch as this natural purity exists as suchness, it exists in all sentient beings as their general characteristic. It is by vir­tue of this that it is taught that all phenomena (!) possess the tathàgata heart. Asvabhàva’s Mahâyânasütrâlamkâratïkâ is silent on IX.37, but his Mahâyânasamgrahopanibandhana on 11.26 follows Vasubandhu, saying that natural purity is the actual true nature of ordinary beings, which means that suchness never changes into anything else, and therefore is the general characteristic of all phenomena.503 Thus, it is said that all sentient beings possess the tathàgata heart. Later in the same text,504 Asvabhàva comments on bodhisattvas attaining an equal mind with regard to all beings on the first bhümi (Mahâyânasamgraha III.l 1) by saying that they see all beings as equality in the sense of their identitylessness, which is why the scriptures state that all beings have the tathàgata heart.Sthiramati says on Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra IX.37 that suchness refers to the nature of the two kinds of identitylessness in terms of persons and phe­nomena, which pervades all entities.505 The personal and phenomenal iden­titylessness that exists in ordinary beings and the personal and phenomenal"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"ii6 Translators Introductionidentitylessness that exists in the noble ones are not different. It is only by virtue of this suchnesss having become pure that it is called “tathagata.” Though suchness exists in everything, once the two kinds of identitylessness have become free from the adventitious afflictive and cognitive obstructions, they are pure, which is called “tathagata.” Thus, because suchness exists in sentient beings, they are all said to possess the tathagata heart.506Furthermore, Bandhuprabhas Buddhabhümyupadesa explains that the teachings on buddha nature refer to the pure dharmadhatu s being present in the mind streams of all sentient beings.507 However, these teachings refer only to those beings who (among the five kinds of dispositions) possess the buddha disposition. They were given only as skillful means, referring only to a small number of sentient beings, and in order to guide those of inde­terminate disposition to swiftly enter the mahayana. Also, the phrase “the Tathàgatas pure dharmadhatu pervades the minds of all sentient beings” means that, just as the Buddhas mind is ultimately pure because its orig­inal nature is luminous and pure, so are the minds of all sentient beings. However, the nature of the mind is suchness, and that the minds of sentient beings are equal to those of buddhas is stated by virtue of the nature of emptiness.Obviously these comments on tathâgatagarbha are remarkably identical with the above-mentioned typical Madhyamaka explanation of this term as meaning nothing but emptiness or identitylessness. With the same com­ments coming from all these Yogâcâra masters, this is clear evidence that at least the early major followers of this tradition did not explain tathâga­tagarbha as the Uttaratantra and R G W do (their taking tathâgatagarbha merely as suchness and not as the dharmakâya, the disposition, and nat­urally luminous mind would correspond only to Uttaratantra 1.28b). As stated before, the main reason for this appears to be that Yogâcâra mas­ters (like any other Buddhists) did not want to go at all near anything that sounds like an àtman, a true self, or an eternal soul. Also, being aware of the Madhyamaka critique of any form of intrinsic existence and being in line with the passages appearing in many Yogâcâra texts that state that ultimate reality, buddhahood, dharmadhâtu, and suchness are free from reference points, Yogâcâra authors were clearly striving to avoid any basis for rei­fication on the level of ultimate reality. Another reason may lie in certain Yogàcàras explaining that “lacking the disposition” (agotra) means to abso­lutely never attain nirvàna.508However, as shown by passages such as the above from the Madhyânta- vibhàga and its commentaries as well as the Dharmadharmatàvibhàgavrtti,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogâcâra 117the same Yogâcâra masters do refer to the closely related themes of minďs luminous natures being obscured only by adventitious stains and emp­tiness’s being both empty and naturally luminous at the time of being a sentient being as well as at the time of being a buddha. Also, Sthirama- ti’s Sütrâlamkâravrttibhâsya states that it is untenable to say that only one among all the innumerable sentient beings who are endowed with the dis­position to become a buddha will become a buddha, while the others will not.509 In fact, everybody who has gathered the two accumulations of merit and wisdom will become a buddha.As mentioned above, there were a number of early Indian Yogâcâra masters whose understanding of tathâgatagarbha was more in accordance with the Uttaratantra, but all of them were mainly active in China and their works are available only in Chinese. Gunabhadra (394-468) was ac­tive in translating and teaching both Yogâcâra and tathâgatagarbha sûtras in China (foremost among them the Lankâvatârasütra, the Samdhinirmo- canasütra, and the Érïmâlâdevïsütra). Ratnamati (late fifth-sixth century), the translator of the Uttaratantra and RGVV into Chinese, greatly empha­sized the tathâgatagarbha teachings, saying that, just as with the tathâgata heart, awakening consists of purifying the âlaya-consciousness from its defilements in order to uncover its pure and original nature (like remov­ing dust from a mirror), rather than eliminating it. Bodhiruci’s translations include the Anünatvâpürnatvanirdesasütra, the Lankâvatârasütra, and the Mahâyânasamgraha. However, it is said that his collaboration with Rat­namati (and Buddhasânta) in translating Vasubandhu’s commentary on the Dasabhümikasütra came to an end over their disagreement as to whether tathâgatagarbha represents classical Yogâcâra thought or not. As Shiu (2006,187) mentions, the Kaiyuan shijiao lu reports that the same conflict led to Ratnamati’s and Bodhiruci’s ending their collaboration on a single translation of the Uttaratantra and each working on a translation of their own (Bodhiruci’s is not preserved).Paramârtha (499-569) was the foremost and most strong-voiced In­dian master to teach and translate Yogâcâra and tathâgatagarbha materi­als in early Buddhist China. He embedded discussions of tathâgatagarbha in several of his translations of Indian Yogâcâra works. For example, in his rather free translations of the Mahâyânasamgrahabhâsya510 and The Awakening o f the Mahâyâna Faith,511 he interpolates passages from the Ut­taratantra and R G W into Yogâcâra treatises and also relates the âlaya-con­sciousness to the tathâgata heart. In addition, he is considered by modern scholars as the author (or at least the commentator and redactor) of the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"ii8 Translators IntroductionBuddhagotrasâstra (Fo Xing Lun),512 which is largely a rewriting of the Ut­taratantra and one of the rare texts that synthesizes explicitly and in detail many classical Yogacara topics, such as the three natures, with the notion of tathâgatagarbha.513In addition, in several of his own texts, Paramàrtha frequently uses the term ^amalavijñána for a ninth consciousness beyond the eight that are common in Yogacara.514 This * amalavijñána is essentially the purified skandha of consciousness and is realized as the fundamental change that is the outcome of the relinquishment of the àlaya-consciousness through the remedies for that consciousness. This resultant state is diametrically opposed to the state of ordinary beings—it is permanent, uncontaminated, and free from karmic formations, afflictions, skandhas, the impregnations of negative tendencies, and all causes of future suffering. It functions as the basis of the path of the noble ones and is what has gained mastery over all virtuous phenomena. Parallel to the àlaya-consciousness’s functioning as the basis of mundane phenomena, the *amalavijñána serves as the basis of supramundane phenomena, and the continuum of these phenomena represents the remedy for the àlaya-consciousness. The *amalavijñána is the naturally luminous mind that is tainted by adventitious stains. It is moreover equated with the perfect nature and said to be the nonexistence of both the imaginary nature and the dependent nature.515 Furthermore, it is said to be not only free from any subject-object duality of deluded con­sciousness but also to be devoid of any distinction between nonconceptual wisdom and its object. By virtue of all these features, the *amalavijñána may reasonably be seen as a bridge to, or even as an equivalent of, the no­tion of tathâgatagarbha.516In India, however, it seems that Yogàcàra masters generally adopted the notion of tathâgatagarbha in accordance with the Uttaratantra only later, when Buddhist tantra with its very similar notions of ground tantra and all beings’ primordially being buddhas was flourishing. Examples of such Yo- gàcàras include Jfiánašrlmitra, Ratnákarašánti,517 and the authors of several commentaries on the prajfiàpàramità sütras from a Yogàcàra perspective.Among these commentaries, both the Šatasáhasrikápaňcavimšatisáha- srikâstâdasasâhasrikâprajââpâramitâbrhattïkâ (abbr. Brhattïkâ) and the Bhagavatyâmnâyânusârinï (a subcommentary on the Brhattïkâ) say that what seems to obscure mind’s true reality (also referred to as suchness, the perfect nature, or buddha nature) consists of nothing but fictitious adventi­tious stains (the imaginary and dependent natures) that can never be a part of or taint mind’s ultimate natural luminosity.518 In this vein, the Brhattïkâ"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"uses and connects the terms tathâgatagarbha and “fundamental change” several times and equates both terms with the perfect nature (suchness). For example:As for “because the realms of sentient beings are completely pure,” the realms of sentient beings are completely pure because all sentient be­ings possess the tathagata heart.519And:The perfect nature of inner and outer phenomena is called “the such­ness of all phenomena,” that is, it is exemplified by “the suchness of form,” “the suchness of sound,” “the suchness of smell,” and so on. The fundamental change of the tathagata heart of all buddhas—the dhar­makaya—is the second one, called “the suchness of the dharmadhatu” because it is the foundation of all buddhadharmas.520And:During the state of ordinary beings, since the tathagata heart is natu­rally completely pure, it lacks being afflicted. When it has undergone the fundamental change, just as space, it also lacks any being purified that has not occurred before. Therefore, [the sütras] say that it is “nei­ther afflicted nor purified.”521Combining early Yogâcâra explanations about the tathâgata heart as suchness with the Uttaratantras three phases of the tathâgata heart, the Brhattïkâ says that “all sentient beings possessing the tathâgata heart” means that “all sentient beings are characterized by suchness,” which is di­vided into the three stages of being impure (sentient beings), both pure and impure (bodhisattvas), and utterly pure (buddhas).522 The Bhaga- vatyâmnâyânusârinï also relates suchness to these three stages.523 The text takes suchness, prajnâpàramitâ, and the dharmakàya to be equivalent and says that they represent ground, path, and fruition, respectively, in terms of the one and the same ultimately existent dharmadhàtu s (the perfect na­tures) being more or less obscured by adventitious stains, which is to be realized by personally experienced wisdom. All this is supported by quoting Uttaratantra 1.153,524 the verse from the Abhidharmamahâyânasütra that is also quoted in R G W;525 Dharmadhâtustava 8-11; MadhyântavibhâgaThe Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogâcâra 119"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"120 Translators Introduction1.14-15 and its Bhâsya; Trisvabhávanirdeša 31, 33, 34, and 36-38; the Vyâkhyàyukti;526 Samâdhirâjasütra IX.23; Acintyastava 38cd-39 and 41; Asahgas lost Determination o f Questions about Suchness; and Pramána- vârttika III.3. In addition, the Bhagavatyàmnâyânusàrinï contains a sec­ond quote of Uttaratantra 1.153 and also cites Uttaratantra IV.90-91 and V .l-2.527The ways in which Prasàstrasenas and Mahàj ana’s commentaries on the Heart Sütra relate to the notion of tathâgatagarbha were already discussed above.Moreover, in terms of their relating Yogàcàra to the tathâgata­garbha teachings, all these authors such as Jñánasrlmitra can be regarded as forerunners of the later Tibetan approach of Shentong, which explicitly combines mainstream Yogàcàra (such as the three natures, the eight con­sciousnesses, and the four or five buddha wisdoms) with the teachings on buddha nature.528In sum, despite certain overlaps with Yogàcàra, the instructions on bud­dha nature in texts such as the Uttaratantra and R G W appear to have re­mained a separate strand of mahàyàna teachings in India for a long time, though they never formed an independent school besides Yogàcàra and Madhyamaka. Although both Màdhyamikas and at least early Yogàcàras were not very enthusiastic about the tathâgatagarbha teachings, there is no critique of the notion of tathâgatagarbha in any Yogàcàra text and even those Màdhyamikas (such as Candrakïrti and Jayànada) who categorized the teaching on tathâgatagarbha as being of expedient meaning did not level any polemics against it. In any case, it is clear that no one in India ever considered the tathâgatagarbha teachings as “un-Buddhist.”529 Even­tually, there was a tendency in certain later Yogàcàra works to incorporate the teachings on tathâgatagarbha into mainstream Yogàcàra. In China, this approach had already manifested much earlier (though it was superseded later by the development of two distinct schools of Yogàcàra and tathâgata­garbha). It was also adopted by certain masters in Tibet from the thirteenth century onward, beginning with the Third Karmapa and Dôlpopa (see “The Meditative Tradition of the Uttaratantra and Shentong” below). Still, as illustrated above, the notion of minds natural luminosity’s being obscured only by adventitious stains, which is so closely related to the teachings on tathâgatagarbha, has always been a quite common theme in Yogàcàra texts. As Keenan (1982,14-15) remarks:"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Its Relationship with Yogacara 121The overarching hypothesis that the preceding passages530 seem to support is that early Yogacara thinkers are indeed concerned with the question of the purity or impurity of consciousness, and this in turn would imply that they developed their thinking in the same doctrinal circles that gave rise to the tathâgatagarbha tradition___The earliest tathâgatagarbha sütras began to appear shortly after the time of Nàgàrjuna (ca. 150-ca. 250), and thus were contemporaneous with or shortly before the above Yogâcàra texts. The tathâgatagarbha tradition offered an alternative to what was perceived as the overly neg­ative tone of the Mádhyamika and prajüâpâramitâ literature. It would thus be natural to assume some kind of connection between tathâgata­garbha and Yogàcàra.. . . [T]he presence in the Ratnagotravibhâga of the famous quo­tation from the Mahâyânâbhidharmasütra suggests that the author of the Ratnagotravibhâga regarded the Mahâyânâbhidharmasütra as being at least consistent with tathâgatagarbha themes. It does seem clear that in some instances the Ratnagotravibhâga is dependent on the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra . . . [which] also suggests that this Yogacara work was well received within tathâgatagarbha circles and was per­ceived as being consistent with tathâgatagarbha themes.This does not mean that tathâgatagarbha is to be reckoned as a de­fined academic school in contrast to Mádhyamika and Yogacara. As Takasaki has pointed out, such an evaluation was a peculiarity of Chi­nese Buddhism and is not found in either India or Tibet. This is fur­ther borne out by the complete lack of polemic against tathâgatagarbha teachings in Yogacara works....The foregoing textual data seem to suggest that the initial pre- Asafigan Yogacara thinkers531 represent a theoretical development from within the same circles that produced the tathâgatagarbha teach­ings. They appear to have taken their initial insights from the notion of the pure mind, as in the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition of the Uttaratantra and ShentongThe Two Approaches of Explaining the UttaratantraAs mentioned above, for the transmission of the five works of Maitreya from India to Tibet, there are the four principal lineages through Ngog Lotsâwa, Dsen Kawoché (two), and Marpa Dopa, all of whom traveled to Kashmir and studied the Maitreya works with the great panditas there (pri­marily Sajjana and Parahita). The lineage through Ngog Lotsâwa is often called “the exegetical tradition of the dharma works of Maitreya” (byams chos bshad lugs), while Dsen Kawoché s transmissions represent “the med­itative tradition of the dharma works of Maitreya” (byams chos sgom lugs). Judging from CMW, Marpa Dopas lineage contains elements of both ap­proaches since CMW s introduction consists of Mahàmudrà-style medita­tion instructions based on the Uttaratantra, while its actual commentary on the words of the Uttaratantra and RGVV consists almost exclusively of scriptural exegesis of a scholarly nature.Ngogs approach is also referred to as “the tradition of studying and re­flecting on the dharma works of Maitreya” (byams chos thos bsam gyi lugs) and, as shown above and in appendices 1 and 2, it was later adopted in most points by the Sakya and Gelug schools. The meditative tradition came to be associated with what is known as the Shentong approach.532GC533 speaks of the two ways of explaining the Uttaratantra through the path of inference based on the Madhyamaka texts and explaining the heart of the matter (snyingpo’i don)5M through the path of direct perception (by which GC essentially means Mahàmudrà).Sâkya Chogden compares the two positions of Ngog and Dsen by saying that Ngog identifies the tathàgata heart as the factor of the natural purity of all phenomena, which pervades all knowable objects and is a space-like nonimplicative negation. Then he describes Dsen s meditative view and ex­plains the complementary relationship between these two traditions:123"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"124 Translators IntroductionThe definitive meaning that he found from having studied the dharmas of Maitreya is explained by those in his lineage as follows. The sugata heart is the naturally pure wisdom, luminous by nature, that pervades [everyone] from buddhas to sentient beings. In earlier times these [two approaches] were known as “the difference between explaining the dharmas of Maitreya as the tradition of characteristics {mtshan nyid kyi lugs) and explaining them as the meditative tradition {sgom lugs).\" However, in both cases there is no contradiction because the [expla­nation] according to the first [approach] is more profound at the time of eliminating the clinging to characteristics, while the [explanation] according to the latter [approach] is needed so that [the sugata heart] can function as the support of qualities.535In its chapter on how the Shentong tradition spread in India and Ti­bet, as mentioned above, TOK states that the intention of the sütras of the third wheel of dharma was elucidated by the works of Maitreya ex­cept the Abhisamayàlamkâra and by Nàgàrjunas collection of praises.536 In India, the meaning of these texts was explained and spread widely by Asariga, Vasubandhu, Candragomï, their followers, Ratnàkarasànti, and others. Dharmapàla (530-561) composed a treatise called Dawn of Bright­ness commenting on Nàgàrjunas collection of reasoning as bearing the intention of the third wheel of dharma. However, while the general phil­osophical system of Maitreya as expressed in the Abhisamayàlamkâra, Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra, and Madhyântavibhàga was explained through many traditions (such as those of Dignàga and Sthiramati), the uncommon view of these texts was sustained in such a way that only the supreme dis­ciples transmitted it orally, with the texts of the Dharmadharmatâvibhàga and Uttaratantra being hidden away as treasure texts until Maitripa redis­covered them. Via *Ànandakïrti and Sajjana, these texts were transmitted to Ngog Lotsàwa as well as Su Gawé Dorje and Dsen Kawoché.TOK calls Ngogs tradition of the Maitreya texts “the oral transmission of explanation” (bshad pa’i bka babs) and Dsens lineage, “the oral trans­mission of practice” {sgrubpai bka babs), saying that they are asserted to hold the views of Madhyamaka and Mere Mentalism, respectively. Based on the latter tradition, masters such as Dsangnagpa Dsondrü Sengé, the Third Karmapa, Dôlpopa, Longchen Rabjampa, Minling Terchen Gyurmé Dorje537 ( 1646-1714) and his brother Lochen DharmasrI ( 1654-1717/18),538 the Eighth Situpa, and their followers539 uttered the lions roar of the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 125irreversible actuality and illuminated the system of Great Madhyamaka, which is the definitive meaning beyond Mere Mentalism.The source of this Shentong system that was widely renowned in both India and Tibet, TOK says, is the Uttaratantra. According to its verse 1.1, its subject matter consists of the seven bodies of the ultimate vajra, which are taught through the seven vajra points in four chapters. Their connection in due order is taught in Uttaratantra 1.3. These seven teach the complete body of the ground, path, and fruition of liberation—the Buddha as the teacher of the path, the dharma as his teachings, the samgha as those who train in it, those who have the disposition to be guided by these three, the awakening that is their liberation, the qualities of that awakening, and its enlightened activity. If these are summarized as the progression of making the path a living experience, since the generation of bodhicitta on the supreme path of the mahayana resembles a leader, it is discussed in order to teach the stages of correctly adopting this motivation of bodhicitta. What the Uttaratantra teaches explicitly is to take refuge in the three jewels (vajra points 1-3). The focal objects of bodhicitta consist of the welfare of others and awakening. Since “others” refers to sentient beings as the objects for whose sake bodhi­citta is generated, this teaches suchness with stains (vajra point 4). The wel­fare of these others is taught by enlightened activity (vajra point 7), and its cause is awakening (vajra point 5). The qualities (vajra point 6) represent the aids for promoting the welfare of others through awakening. Further­more, all seven vajra points are determined through the principle of the two realities.JKC s introduction explains the following on the two traditions of ex­plaining the Uttaratantra and the texts relationship with Shentong.540 In general, it is the abiding principle of all texts of Maitreya that what is to be known at the time of the ground, the object of the view at the time of the path, and the svàbhàvikakàya at the time of the fruition are all pre­sented on the basis of dharmadhàtu wisdom. For example, in the Abhi- samayâlamkâra, the dharmadhàtu is explained as the basis of purification, the means of purification consist of the four trainings,541 what is to be pu­rified are all factors to be relinquished through seeing and familiarization, and the result of purification is the attainment of the dharmakàya.Here in the Uttaratantra, the basis of purification is the sugata heart. The means of purification consist of the four factors of faith in the dharma, prajñá, samàdhi, and compassion,542 as well as the sixty factors of purifi­cation in the Dhâranïsvararàjasütra. What is to be purified are the nine stains illustrated by the nine examples, the three obscurations (afflictive,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"126 Translators Introductioncognitive, and those of meditative absorption),543 and the four factors of hostility toward the dharma, views about a self, fear of samsâras suffer­ing, and indifference about the welfare of sentient beings.544 The result of purification consists of the result of freedom from all those factors to be purified, which is the manifestation of the dharmakàya with its qualities and enlightened activity. Thus, apart from mere differences in terminology, the presentations in all Maitreya texts come down to the same meaning.Therefore, these texts do not differ with regard to the following. At the time of the ground, the àlaya is presented as the foundation into which the individual latent tendencies of samsara and nirvana are input. At the time of the path, the adventitious stains are explained as the factors to be relin­quished, and the factor of natural purity—self-aware wisdom—is accepted as what is to be experienced. At the time of the fruition, the wisdom of the final fundamental change is established to be existent.With regard to this basis of the Uttaratantras exposition, JKC follows GC in saying that there are the two systems of explaining it (1) through the path of inference that relies on the Madhyamaka texts and (2) through the path of the direct perception of the heart of the matter.(1) The first one is the approach of Ngog Lotsâwa and his followers, who hold the tathâgata heart to be ultimate reality, which is the emptiness that is the nonimplicative negation explained in the Madhyamaka collection of reasoning. However, this ultimate reality is not even a mere referent ob­ject, let alone being an object of terms and conceptions. According to Ngog and his followers, being naturally endowed with qualities is only a label for all qualities naturally gathering, if one focuses on that emptiness. The cause of purified phenomena is taken to be twofold identitylessness—the focal object of the wisdom of purification. This identitylessness is not to be newly added. The cause of afflicted phenomena consists of the personal and phenomenal identities that are superimposed by afflictiveness. Since these focal objects of the afflictions are not established at all, there is noth­ing previously existent to be removed. The meaning of the dharmakâya’s being pervasive is explained as the dharmakàya of sentient beings being suitable to be attained.(2) The explanation of the Uttaratantra through the path of the direct perception of the heart of the matter consists of the teachings of the fol­lowers of the meditative tradition of the Maitreya texts (as transmitted by Su Gawé Dorje and Dsen Kawoché) and Maitripas pith instructions on prajnàpâramità that accord with mantra (such as the Tattvadasaka), which"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"he composed after having received the instructions of Saraha and Savaripa. Having heard them from Maitripa, Marpa said:The heart of the matter of the ultimate yàna,Mental nonengagement free from extremes,Shall be pointed out as the dharma that is Mahâmudrâ.Gampopas statement, “The text for this Mahâmudrâ of ours is the Mahâyànottaratantrasâstra composed by the Bhagavàn Maitreya” was elucidated in his writings545 and followed by Pamo Trupa, Jigden Surngon546 (1143-1217), and the Third Karmapa, who all saw the heart of the matter directly. A later rebirth of Jigden Surngon, Dôlpopa, composed The Fourth Council, which is the heart of the definitive meaning. Likewise, Sàkya Chogden, Tàranàtha, the Eighth Situpa, and so on, apart from some minor differences in their positions, all arrive at the same essential point about the view. Furthermore the extensive instructions by Maitrlpas student Vajrapàni on the Tattvadasaka, its commentary, and so on, in Tibet represent the tradition of Mahâmudrâ that teaches exactly the meaning of this system. Also, Padampa Sangyé (another student of Maitripa) gave the name The Pacification o f Suffering to this dharma of Mahâmudrâ whose essence is prajnàpàramità and that accords with secret mantra. In brief, JKC says, all the transmissions coming from Maitripa, notwithstanding some different phrasings, likewise come down to the same point.The essence of all these explanations is the sugata heart, which is the lu­minous nature of the mind. At the time when it exists in the mind streams of sentient beings, it is called “disposition,” and they are said to possess the buddha heart. Just as the king of the nàgas ascends from the depths of the ocean to the higher realms, this tathàgata heart rises toward the dhar­mas of the path and the fruition. At the time of having become a buddha, it is called “dharmakàya” and has become fully manifest. Just as Brahmàs emanations descend to earth, it then also covers all samsàric phenomena. The only difference at these two times is whether the tathàgata heart is or is not free from stains, but there is no better or worse or any change in the essence of the basic element of sentient beings and the dharmakàya. From that perspective, they are the same in that both are suchness. This is taught through the example of the Buddhas dwelling on earth and pervading the three realms with his physical appearances.To divide these three (the disposition, the dharmakàya, and suchness) further, there are the naturally abiding disposition and the unfoldingThe Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 127"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"128 Translators Introductiondisposition. The former abides in the mind streams of sentient beings in the manner of their heart since time without beginning, like a treasure un­der the house of a pauper. Within the power of the disposition abiding as the ground, the unfolding disposition consists of the increase of qualities through perfectly accomplishing the virtues of studying and so forth on the paths of learning, just as a fruit-bearing tree grows after it has been newly planted. The naturally abiding disposition functions as the cause of attaining the svâbhâvikakâya and the unfolding disposition, as the cause of the two rûpakàyas. That the unfolding disposition abides as the ground or the cause is asserted by Rangjung Dorje. The dharmakàya is also two­fold—the actual fully qualified dharmakàya endowed with twofold pu­rity and the natural outflow of realizing it (the words of a buddha that teach the principles of the profound ultimate reality and the diversity of seeming reality). Suchness is divided into two in the general words of the Buddha—the true reality of the ultimate and the true reality of the seem­ing. Gô Lotsâwa holds that all three (the disposition, the dharmakàya, and suchness) are divided into ultimate and seeming.The intention of the Uttaratantra is that suchness is undifferentiable, which refers to the true nature of the mind abiding without change and interruption as being similar in type from sentient beings up through bud- dhas. This nature of the mind is taught through many names and exam­ples. In the sùtras, it is referred to as prajftâpàramità, ultimate reality, the true end, the basic nature, the unchanging perfect nature, the nature of phenomena, mind as such, emptiness, and so on. In the mantrayàna, it has many synonyms such as primordial protector, connate wisdom, great bindu, natural luminosity, and Mahàmudrà. This pure luminous nature is obscured by cloud-like adventitious stains, which arise simultaneously with it, like a film on gold, and consist of the consciousnesses that manifest as the dualistic appearances of apprehender and apprehended. They are given many names, such as àlaya-consciousness, dependent nature, the mistaken­ness of the seeming, and the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance. From this, the four obscurations such as hostility toward the dharma arise, and thereby one does not realize the basic nature and is fettered in samsàra. Through the four causes such as faith in the supreme yàna, the basic nature is realized perfectly and the adventitious stains are eradicated, which leads to the manifestation of the buddha heart. This is called “dharmakàya.” Since this natural luminosity was primordially never tainted by stains, there is nothing to be removed in it—the stains are fabricated and adventitious, and therefore the basic element is empty of them. Since its qualities are"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 129its intrinsic nature, there is nothing to be newly added that did not exist before—the qualities are characterized by being inseparable from the basic element, and therefore it is not empty of them. This is like someone with jaundice seeing a yellow conch shell—the actual conch is empty of being yellow but is not empty of being white.When this actuality is determined through study and reflection, JKC says, according to the Uttaratantra s statement that “the true end is void of conditioned phenomena in all aspects,”547 it is first analyzed through Shen­tong reasoning. Then, one familiarizes with it in accordance with verses such as the following:Without beginning, middle, and end, undifferentiable,Nondual, freed [in] three [ways], stainless, and nonconceptual—This is the nature of the dharmadhatu, which is seen By yogins in the meditative equipoise of realizing it.548What is to be experienced through such familiarization is held to be the wisdom that is empty of duality.549 This refers to the same essential point as the venerable Sakyapa saying:Having determined it as the freedom from extremes, make it a living experience as union (zung 'jug).550The great beings who hold this explanatory system are known as “Shen­tong Màdhyamikas.” The mere term “empty of other” is also explicitly used in the sütras, and in Tibet this system arose through the great siddha Yumowa Mikyo Dorjes551 (born 1027) having composed his “fourfold cycle of Lucid Lamps.\"552 Those who widely spread this term Shentong and its meaning were Dôlpopa and his followers. Though there is nothing discor­dant in the essential points of their view and meditation, there are some special features of their philosophical position in the context of determin­ing the view. In particular, Dôlpopa explains the tathàgata heart in a literal way as the pàramitàs of supreme purity, permanence, self, and bliss. All Ti­betans understood this as something really established set up by the mind and then refuted it. However, what Dôlpopa had in mind as the meaning of permanence and so on is the changeless expanse.553 He asserted that this expanse is liberated from all characteristics of reference points, is beyond terms and thoughts, and is the object of unmistaken nonconceptual wis­dom. Since it withstands analysis through reasoning, one can only mistake it"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"130 Translators Introductionfor something that it is not when one subjects it to such analysis. He says that it is the same as the reflections of the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects taught in the Kalacakratantra being expressed as “Mahámudrá.”In brief, JKC says, the root of these two ways of explaining the Ut­taratantra through the paths of inference and direct perception is whether the tathágata heart is taken to be actually existent or nonexistent. Also, the tathágata heart’s serving as the two referents of analysis and meditation derives from understanding the following crucial verses of the Uttaratantra through looking toward the outside and the inside, respectively:There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.A contemporary work on Kagyii Shentong Madhyamaka by Sherab Püntso,554 which draws extensively on texts by the Third, Seventh, and Eighth Karmapas, the Fifth Shamarpa, the Eighth Situpa, and Jamgon Kongtrul, reports what Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche (born 1933), the present tutor to the seventeenth Karmapa, states about the main difference between the exegetical and the meditative traditions of the works of Maitreya. The former is said to explain the meaning of tathágatagarbha mainly as the element that is the basic nature of phenomena in the sense of the empty dharmadhatu free from all reference points, which is the emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation and is explained in Nágárjuna s collection of reasoning. The latter explains the meaning of tathágatagarbha mainly as the element of luminosity that is wisdom and is characterized by being the emptiness that is an implicative negation.555Among the texts translated or summarized in this volume, CMW s in­troduction, IM, RW, HML, GISM, and the fragments from Dsen Kawoché s work (as well as, in part, Sajjanas SM, the Eighth Karmapas Lamp, and Mónlam Tsiiltrims The Essential Pith Instructions That Summarize the Quintessence o f the Pitakas) are clear examples of the meditative tradition of the works of Maitreya. Not only that but the first five and the last one"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"combine Uttaratantra-based Shentong and Mahâmudrâ in a very obvious manner.Thus, contrary to the claims of some modern scholars, it is clear that it was not only from the time of the Eighth Situpa onward that the “in­compatible” views of Shentong and Mahâmudrâ were joined, but they were obviously regarded as perfectly compatible by a number of masters much earlier. In fact, an incompatibility between Shentong and Mahâmudrâ was voiced by Dôlpopa only in his rejection of the position found in many Kagyü Mahâmudrâ texts that the difference between ultimate reality and seeming reality or between buddhahood and mistakenness is merely real­izing or not realizing the nature of the mind, as epitomized by the famous statement “The essence of thoughts is the dharmakàya.” Dolpopa’s critique was based on his above-mentioned sharp distinction between the spheres of ordinary consciousness and nondual wisdom (or seeming and ultimate reality) as being like two separate kingdoms. However, the way in which the Shentong view is usually formulated in the Kagyü School (primarily based on the writings of the Third Karmapa),556 as well as in CMW and Monlarn Tsültrim s texts, does not entail this strict separation but speaks of the con­fused mind and the awakened mind in terms of the latter s being the true nature of the former (similar to ice and water).In that vein, Mathes (2008a, 375) reports Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoches oral explanation of the difference between Shentong and Mahâmudrâ as follows. During analysis, the adventitious stains and buddha nature are necessarily differentiated since buddha nature is empty of what does not belong to it (that is, it is shentong—“empty of other”). But when buddha nature is directly realized in Mahâmudrâ, there is no longer any difference between it and the adventitious stains or seeming reality.Thus, in this context, one needs to keep in mind that since all phenom­ena of seeming reality are not really existent in the first place (and Dôl­popa and Mahâmudrâ agree on this), there is always only one ultimately real phenomenon to begin with, which is buddha nature or minds natural luminosity. Consequently, in fact, there is only a single actual reality, and therefore any presentation or separation of two realities is necessarily of expedient meaning.The Shentong Lineages and the Meditative Tradition of the Uttaratantra in the Jonang, Kagyü, and Nyingma SchoolsIn terms of the diversity of the Shentong tradition, as demonstrated else­where,557 the view of the Third Karmapa, who is traditionally consideredThe Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 131"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"132 Translators Introductionthe foremost authority on the view of buddha nature in the Karma Kagyii School, neither matches Shentong as understood by Dolpopa, Taranatha, and other Jonangpas, nor Sakya Chogdens or Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye s presentations of it. Of course, one can find certain similarities, but there are significant differences between the Third Karmapa s view and var­ious brands of Shentong. This is clearly acknowledged by several Kagyii masters, such as the First Karma Trinlepa, a close student of the Seventh Karmapa and an important teacher of the Eighth, who comments on lines 4-5 in the ninth chapter of the Third Karmapa s The Profound Inner Reality as follows:The basic element of sentient beings is the stainless buddha heart endowed with the two realities.The meaning of this is that unconditioned and spontaneously pres­ent mind as such, the dharmakaya beyond the entire web of reference points, which has the nature of being all-pervading like space, exists as ultimate reality. However, this does not teach that the sugata heart is really established, permanent, enduring, and totally unchanging. Also the [Seventh Karmapa s] statement in his Ocean o f Texts on Reasoning that nondual wisdom is established as ultimate reality means that it is “established as being ultimate reality,” but he does not assert that it is really established, permanent, enduring, and totally unchanging. Some think, “If something is established as ultimate reality, it must be really established,” but they have not examined [this issue properly], since [their objection] comes down to nothing but being mistaken about the mere name “reality.” For example, though something may be estab­lished as seeming reality, [that does not mean that] it needs to be really established. Therefore, most present-day proponents of Shentong and the position of glorious Rangjung [Dorje] differ.Also the statement by my omniscient guru [the Seventh Karmapa] that “rangtong and shentong are not contradictory” is an excellent ex­planation, [which shows] that he has realized this meaning. Thus, [the autocommentary] says that what is to be expressed is the mode of be­ing of the buddha heart that exists as the great freedom from extremes, the inseparability of appearance and emptiness, and the union of the two realities. The sugata heart is nothing but the unmistaken own es­sence of the eight collections [of consciousness] explained in chapter1. Here, the distinct and unmixed eight collections are the seeming,"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"and their unmistaken own essence is the ultimate, the two realities thus being a union. However, those who do not realize the meaning of the two realities are ignorant about the dependent origination that is only satisfying when not examined, thus circling in samsara through their views of clinging to extremes, such as permanence and extinction. By stating the shortcomings of not realizing the two realities, [Rangjung Dorje] teaches that one needs to train in the mode of being of the two realities in union.558A poem by Karma Trinlepa, in which he answers questions by one of his students about rangtong and shentong,559 starts by pointing out that this dis­cussion involves a lot of rigid fixation on both sides. He continues by sum­marizing what the Seventh Karmapa says about how rangtong and shentong are understood wrongly and correctly. Out of attachment to a nihilistic view, he says, certain present-day conceited Rangtongpas assert that empti­ness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation is ultimate reality. But this is not the genuine rangtong asserted by the learned Rangtong Madhyamikas. Said people may well meditate by being attached to such a rabbit horn-like nonexistence, but they will not experience the basic nature through this. Since nonexistence is not the sphere of valid cognition, how could it possi­bly be something that is realized by personally experienced wisdom? If one focuses on rangtong as a nihilistic view, forget about seeing true emptiness. The genuine rangtong explained by the previous learned ones is that all phenomena are empty of a nature of their own, but this is not a nonimpli­cative negation. Though it is empty of the appearances of apprehender and apprehended, the wisdom without the duality of apprehender and appre­hended exists. “Empty” in the word “emptiness” does not mean “nothing whatsoever”—this is not the correct understanding of being empty, but just the extreme of being empty. Rather, one should consider that “-ness” is a suffix that indicates affirmation.According to the Seventh Karmapa, Karma Trinlepa says, there are also some contemporary conceited Shentongpas, who claim that an ultimate that is permanent, enduring, eternal, immutable, and really established is the profound shentong, since it is empty of the adventitious stains of appre­hender and apprehended. Such a claim amounts to nothing but faking ones clinging to such an eternalistic view as being profound emptiness, but is not the pure shentong taught in the sutras. Through being mistaken about Mai- treyas statement that “mind as such is not empty of unsurpassable qual­ities” (Uttaratantra 1.155), they say that shentong refers to the sixty-fourThe Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 133"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"134 Translator s Introductionqualities that exist at the time of the ground in a manner of being empty of adventitious stains. However, this means nothing but deprecating the buddhas by implying that sentient beings are completely perfect buddhas in whom all obscurations are terminated and wisdom has unfolded but who nevertheless circle in samsara because they experience the sufferings of the six types of beings in the hells and so forth.560Finally, Karma Trinlepa reports what the Seventh Karmapa taught him about the correct view of Shentong as explained by the Third Karmapa:The meaning that is taught in the tantras, the bodhisattva commentaries,561Many sutras, and by those who follow the [five] dharmas of Maitreya Represents the Shentong held by Rangjung Dorje,About which I heard the following from the mighty victor.He said that mind as such, unconfined, unbiased,Naturally luminous, expanse and awareness inseparable,The great sphere, ordinary mind,Whose essence does not change into anything,Is known as “other-empty” from the point of view ofHaving become buddhahood, once it is pure of adventitious stains.That this primordial ground is not tainted by any obscurations Is the purport of “being empty of other.”This very mind as such being ignorant about itself Is called “adventitious obscuration.”Since this is something suitable to be separated from mind,The nature of phenomena is empty of it and thus “other-empty.”The sixty-four qualities that reside within the basic nature Are indeed never separable from mind,So speak about “obscured buddhahood” at the time of the ground And “stainless buddhahood” at the time of the fruition!The thirty-two qualities of freedom from all obscurations And the thirty-two maturational [qualities] of enlightened activity unfoldingAre the distinctive features of a perfect buddha alone—We do not assert that these exist at [the time of] the ground."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The sixty-four qualities that exist at [the time] of the ground Are obscured by obscurations—through eliminating these stains,One becomes a stainless victor. Therefore, the basis of being empty In terms of other-emptiness is the sugata heart—The nature of the mind is primordially just this.What it is to be emptied of are the adventitious stains to be relinquished,Which are referred to as the imaginations of apprehender and apprehended.Therefore, ultimate reality is nothing but mind as such Free from the imaginations of apprehender and apprehended,Natural luminosity, the connate union,The inseparability of expanse and awareness, ordinary mind—This is the view of profound other-emptiness.Therefore, “rangtong” and “shentong9 Are not held to be contradictory by my guru.In brief, if phrased by way of a correct understanding of the categories rangtong and shentong, Rangjung Dorje’s view can be said to regard these two as not being mutually exclusive and to combine them in a creative synthesis. Moreover, by using terms such as “connate union” and “ordinary mind,” Karma Trinlépa explicitly equates the Karmapas Shentong view with Mahâmudrâ. As mentioned above, the Third Karmapa himself equates buddha nature with Mahâmudrâ in his commentary on the Dharmadhâtustava.561This portrait of the Third Karmapa’s Shentong is confirmed by A Pro­nouncement o f Realization by the Sixth Shamarpa, Chokyi Wangchug (1584-1630), which says:Indeed, the learned set up mere presentations Of “self-empty” and “other-empty,”But the great victor, glorious Rangjung [Dorje],Holds these two to be noncontradictory.563This is followed by establishing the Shentong view of the Kagyü lineage as the correct view by explicitly distinguishing it from the one of Dôlpopa.564 Based on this Shentong view, the Shamarpa then presents the meditation as Mahâmudrâ and also connects it with the Uttaratantra.565The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 135"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"136 Translators IntroductionSimilarly, a song about the view by the Thirteenth Karmapa, Düdül Dorje (1733-1797), declares the following on what is called \"Shentong Madhyamaka”:When commenting on its meaning, venerable Rangjung [Dorje] says That it is one with the system of Candraklrti.Others assert that the ultimate is existent and really established And that emptiness is really established.As for the maháyána s sütra portion, both the middle and the final wheel [of dharma]Have the purport of the sugata heart, the unity of emptiness and luminosity.The middle [wheel] explains this mainly by teaching emptiness,While the final [wheel] elucidates it mainly by teaching luminosity.I understand that, in actuality, these are not contradictory.566Though there are many more details, these passages show clearly that what is sometimes called “Kagyii Shentong” is not at all the same as the Shentong view proclaimed by Dolpopa, Táranátha, and their followers.567 Still, as the works by those latter masters and the above passages from Kagyü texts show, in both cases the Uttaratantra and the presentation of buddha nature represent major cornerstones of their views.568As mentioned above, Táranáthas Supplication to the Profound Shentong Madhyamaka569 and its supplement by Ngawang Lodro Tragpa present the lineage of the sütra-based Shentong tradition of the Jonang School as com­ing from Buddha Sákyamuni to Maitreya, Asañga, Vasubandhu, Maitrlpa, *Ánandakírti, Ratnákarasánti, Sajjana, Su Gawé Dorje, Dsen Kawoché, Tarma Dsóndrü, Yeshé fungné (twelfth century), Jangchub Kyab and Jangchub Shónnu (twelfth/thirteenth century), Kyoton Mónlam Tsültrim (1219-1299), Jomden Rigpé Raltri (1227-1305), Kyiton Jampéyang Tragpa Gyaltsen (thirteenth century), Dolpopa (1292-1361), Nyaón Kunga Bal (1285-1379), Chobal Gónpo, Lodro Sangpo Gyatso, Tónyo Bal (all four­teenth/fifteenth century), Sákya Chogden (1428-1507), Tónyo Trubpa (fifteenth/sixteenth century), Kunga Drolcho (1507-1565/66), Kunga Gyaltsen (sixteenth century), Tragden Trubpa (sixteenth/seventeenth cen­tury), Táranátha (1575-1634), Jetsünma Trinlé Wangmo (1585?—1668?), Kunga Balsang (1629-1686), several unnamed masters in between, Kunga Yónten Gyatso (1818-1890), Palden Namnang Dorje, Kunga Óser, Tsognyi"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 137Gyatso (1880-1940), Kunga Tugjé Palsang (1925-2000), and Ngawang Lo- drô Tragpa (1920-1975).570 An alternative Shentong lineage from the Bud­dha is said to run through Vajrapani, Ràhulabhadra, Nàgàrjuna, Savaripa, and Maitrlpa. After the latter, it continues as above.Tàranàtha s text states that this represents the lineage of the instructions that combine the intention of all sütras of the final wheel of dharma and their commentaries, while there are distinct lineages for the guiding in­structions of each one of the five Maitreya texts. Nevertheless, from the texts by Mônlam Tsültrim (who is included in the above lineage), it is clear that the tradition of Su Gawé Dorje and Dsen Kawoché at least with re­gard to the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatavibhaga was continued through the Kadampa School and then the Jonang School. Also, the fact that the works by Mônlam Tsültrim were written down by his students, such as Séu Chôkyi Gyaltsen, and still exist today shows that a textual tradi­tion based on Dsen s instructions survived.In addition to this sütra-based lineage, Tàranàtha s Necessary Sources o f the Dharma Cycle of the Kalacakratantra571 presents a tantric Shentong lin­eage as running from Kàlacakrapàda the Elder, Srlbhadra (Kàlacakrapàda the Younger; both eleventh century), Bodhibhadra, Pandita Somanàtha, Dro Lotsàwa Sherab Tra572 (both twelfth century), Lhajé Gompa,573 Drotôn Namdse,574 Yumowa Mikyô Dorje, Dharmesvara,575 Namka Oser,576 Machig Tulku Jobum,577 Semochewa Namka Gyaltsen,578 Jamyang Sarma Sherab Oser,579 Künkyen Chôku Oser580 (1214-1292), Künpangpa Tugjé Dsôndrü581 (1243-1313), up through582 Dôlpopa. From there, this lineage continues as in the above sütra Shentong lineage.As mentioned above, one way in which these particular lineages came to the Kagyü and Nyingma schools is outlined in Jamgôn Kongtruls GISM. Previous connections between Kadampa and Jonang on the one hand and Nyingma and Kagyü on the other notwithstanding,583 GISM says that, af­ter Tàranàtha, the Shentong lineage that reached Jamgôn Kongtrul went through Gyaltsab Nartangpa Lodrô Namgyal (1618-1683), Ngawang Trinlé (1657-1723), Künsang Wangpo (born late sixteenth/early seventeenth cen­tury), Gahto Tsewang Norbu (1698-1755),584 the Eighth Situpa (1699/1700- 1774), the Thirteenth Karmapa (1733/1734-1797/1798), and the Ninth Situpa (1774-1853), who was Jamgôn Kongtruls main teacher. Accord­ing to the colophon of GISM, Kongtrul also received Jonang instructions directly from Ngawang Chôpel Gyatso585 (c. 1788-1865) in Dzamtang.586 From Jamgôn Kongtrul, all these teachings went to his many students in the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"138 Translators IntroductionNyingma, Kagyü, and Sakya schools. Today, the Shentong instructions of this lineage are primarily upheld in the Karma Kagyü tradition.Of particular relevance for the Kagyü and Nyingma lineages is that vidyàdhara Tsewang Norbu, from the Nyingma monastery of Gahto in east Tibet, was a teacher of the Thirteenth Karmapa, the Tenth Shamarpa, Chodrub Gyatso (1742-1792), and, most importantly, the Eighth Situpa.587 He introduced the teachings on Shentong and the Kâlacakratantra that he had received from the Jonang yogin Künsang Wangpo to these lead­ing Karma Kagyü masters. The Eighth Situpas autobiography says that he had been interested in the Shentong teachings for many years but only ob­tained them from Tsewang Norbu, who taught them to him in great detail at the stüpa of Bauddhanâth in Kathmandu. Thereafter, Situpa says, Tse­wang Norbu ordered him to uphold the profound view of Shentong, which would result in Situpas longevity and the vast spread of his teachings. The Eighth Situpa also mentions several forms of Shentong and states that he follows the one by the Seventh Karmapa and Sâkya Chogden, which differs from Dolpopas. Thus, Tsewang Norbu and the Eighth Situpa were crucial in preparing the ground for the revival of the Shentong view outside of the Jonang tradition proper, which culminated in the widespread acceptance of this view within the Rimé movement in the next century. This movement was spearheaded by Nyingma, Kagyü, and Sakya masters such as Dza Patrul Rinpoche, Jamgôn Kongtrul, Jamyang Kyentsé Wangpo588 (1820-1892), and later Mipham Rinpoche.589 Kyentsé Wangpo s rebirth, Jamyang Chôkyi Lodrô590 (1896-1958), is also said to have had great appreciation for the Shentong view.On the situation of Shentong in the present-day Kagyü and Nyingma schools, Stearns (2010, 82-83) says correctly:All the special teachings of the Jonang lineage and the vital transmis­sion of the collected writings of Dôlpopa and Tàranàtha have been maintained by the Jonang tradition in Amdo. But even the reading transmission of any of Dolpopas writings seems scarce among lead­ing shentong adherents of the Kagyü and Nyingma traditions. When the shentong is taught by these teachers, the different works of Kong­trul and Mipam, which vary a great deal from the original teachings of Dôlpopa, are usually the treatises of choice. What is now taught as the shentong view in the Kagyü and Nyingma traditions represents a syn­thesis that has developed over time, primarily in order to enable Dol­popas most profound insights to be incorporated into the established"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 139doctrines of the Great Seal and the Great Perfection. Thus the shentong view and Six-branch Yoga taught by the living masters of the Jonang tradition in Amdo, based on the oral transmission and literary legacy of the ancient masters of Jonang, is certainly closer to what was trans­mitted centuries ago by Dolpopa and Táranátha.Note, however, that Mipham Rinpoche wrote only two texts on Shen­tong,591 and he also said that he himself does not follow the Shentong view.592 Nevertheless, some in the Nyingma tradition, mainly following the position of Mipham s close student Shechen Gyaltsab Padma Namgyal593 (1871-1926), claim that Mipham was a Shentongpa, and his two texts on Shentong are still widely used in both the Nyingma and Kagyii schools. Stearns (2010, 81-82) says furthermore that Dilgo Khyentsé Rinpoche594 (1910-1991), Kalu Rinpoche595 (1905-1989), and Diijom Rinpoche596 (1904-1987) all accepted the Shentong view and that most present-day Kagyü and Nyingma teachers follow the lineages of explanations and practices passed down by these three masters. However, with regard to the Nyingma masters Dilgo Khyentsé Rinpoche and Diijom Rinpoche, the Ny­ingma scholar Dorji Wangchuk (2005,176-77) states:I am not aware of any textual evidence that would suggest that these teachers were proponents of the gzan stong doctrine, at least not in Dol-po-pa’s sense. Both ... speak about the oneness of appearance and emptiness or the compatibility of the Middle and Last Cycles of the Buddha s teachings.597Generally, despite some claims to the contrary, it seems safe to say that the Shentong view is not a widely held position in the Nyingma School and is not usually considered such a big issue there. The exceptions seem to be Lochen DharmasrI598 (1654-1717), Tsewang Norbu, Gedsé Pandita Gyurmé Tsewang Chogdrub599 (1761-1829), and of course Jamgon Kongtrul. How­ever, as mentioned above, the Nyingma view always seeks primarily to be in line with Dzogchen as this tradition s hallmark. In that regard, Mipham Rinpoche and others stated repeatedly that the Dzogchen view accords with *Prásañgika Madhyamaka.The Shentong view was and continues to be more important in the Kagyii schools, but this seems to be primarily the case since Jamgon Kong­trul appeared to be such a strong advocate of this view. Though it is true that many contemporary Kagyii masters follow a kind of Shentong, as"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"140 Translators Introductionmentioned above, this “Kagyü Shentong” differs in several ways from the Jonang Shentong. Despite Jamgon Kongtruls presentations being followed widely at present, when it comes to an indigenous Kagyü Shentong that is not mixed with Dolpopas and Tàranâtha’s view, the works by the Third, Seventh, and Eighth Karmapas, the Eighth Situpa, and the first and second Karma Trinlépas are more authoritative.600 As for the above statement by Cyrus Stearns about the late Kalu Rinpoche (the then head of the Shangpa Kagyü lineage,601 who was considered as the activity emanation of Jamgon Kongtrul Lodrô Tayé), it is true that he embraced the Shentong view and also had a certain influence on Karma Kagyü masters in that regard. How­ever, the most influential contemporary Shentong proponents in the Karma Kagyü School are no doubt its two senior-most masters, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche and Khenchen Tsültrim Gyatso Rinpoche (born 1934).Indian Forerunners of Shentong, Early Tibetan Shentongpas, and Their Connection to the UttaratantraAs mentioned above, there are two models of the relationship between the three natures—(1) the classical Yogacara model of the perfect natures being the dependent nature empty of the imaginary nature and (2) the Shentong model of the perfect natures being empty of both the imaginary and the dependent natures. The latter model is found in the Brhattïkâ, the Bhagavatyàmnâyânusârinï, and some texts by Ratnàkarasànti, which in ad­dition all equate the perfect nature with the tathagata heart (thus in effect saying that the tathàgata heart is empty of what is other—the adventitious stains of both the imaginary and dependent natures). Some of these texts add that it is precisely the manner of the perfect natures being empty of the other two natures that is the reason for the perfect natures being referred to as being the true emptiness (in the sense of a truly existent remainder that is empty of something else), which corresponds well to R G W s explana­tion of what true emptiness means in the case of the tathàgata heart. Both R G W and these texts say that this true emptiness avoids the extremes of superimposition and denial. Naturally, R G W and some of these texts share the above-mentioned quote from the Cülasunnatasutta.602 The Shentong model (2) is also implied in Sajjanas SM and explicitly stated in a synopsis of Dsen Kawochés view based on his own writings by the Jonang master Kunga Drôlcho (1507-1565/66). Thus, all these works can be said to be Indian and early Tibetan forerunners of crucial elements of what later be­came known as the Shentong view. Furthermore, without presenting model(2), Jnànasrlmitras Sâkârasiddhisâstra and several of the texts by Monlarn"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Tsültrim (especially IM, RW, and HML) exhibit clear connections between the Uttaratantra and Shentong.603To begin with Sajjanas SM, two of its verses and their glosses con­tain interesting passages in terms of a Shentong stance with regard to the tathagata heart. Verse 9, which comments on Uttaratantra 1.27-28, says:[Beings are endowed with] the heart of a tathagata,Because the disposition for the [tathagata] exists [in them].The suchness of the dhàtu is devoidOf what is afflicted—the dependent (paratantra).mThus, the tathagata heart (suchness, the dharmadhàtu) is explicitly said to be empty of the dependent nature (that is, mere conditioned appearances). Since it is empty even of the dependent nature, there is no question of its also being empty of the imaginary nature (the seeming duality of apprehender and apprehended within mere conditioned appearances). This is very close to the above-mentioned position of the Brhattikâ, the Âmnàyànusârinï, the Satasâhasrikâprajnâpâramitàbrhattïkâ, and Dsen Kawoché (see below) that the perfect nature is empty of both the imaginary and dependent natures. In addition, an interlinear gloss (in the same hand) between lines b and c of this verse in SM refers to the tathàgata heart as “the seed that represents the disposition of the victors [being covered by] the two kinds of obscurations” (afflictive and cognitive obscurations). Thus, both these obscurations are included in the dependent nature.Verse 28 of SM comments on Uttaratantra 1.156-67 as being the justifi­cation for dispelling, through reasoning (yukti), refutation (uddhâra), and accomplishment (prasâdhana)605 the wrong view that the teachings on the tathàgata heart are not authoritative. In terms of reasoning and refutation, an interlinear gloss on this verse 28 refers to the objection in Uttaratantra 1.156 that everything without exception is to be understood as being empty because of being conditioned. In response, the tathàgata heart—luminous mind—is said to be unconditioned. Unlike ordinary minds and mental fac­tors, which are usually described as being contingent on four conditions (object condition, dominant condition, immediate condition, and causal condition), the sole factor for the arising of luminous mind is a previous instance of that very luminous mind. Accordingly, by virtue of its being unconditioned, luminous mind is not empty, at least not in the same way as conditioned phenomena, which do not exist on their own, but are only adventitious stains that are just as unreal as clouds, dreams, and illusions.The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 141"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"142 Translators IntroductionThus, the tathágata heart does not arise from anything nor is it produced by anything. Rather, it is merely revealed by realizing that the stains are illusory and never really existed in the first place:“Since it is known that [the statement] ‘Everything is empty, because it is conditioned, just as clouds and so on’ is taught everywhere with­out difference [such as in the prajñápáramitá sütras], the teaching of the Tatlmgatagarbhasütra that the nature of the mind is the ultimate is contradictory.” This is the meaning of the objection to [this teaching’s] being authoritative.In this regard, what is conditioned is [indeed] necessarily empty, but luminous mind is not conditioned. For, by virtue of the close connec­tion of the arising of a following [moment of this basic] awareness’s being contingent on nothing but the occurring of a preceding [mo­ment of this awareness] that is of the same kind, there is no activity through conditions in that [luminous mind].The examples of clouds, dreams, and illusions are for the sake of pointing out [the nature of] the subject of the probandum—the af­flictiveness of afflictions, karma, and birth—because emptiness is the probandum with regard to the afflictiveness of afflictions and so on.606 For, if [the examples] were just examples [and did not exactly match the nature of this threefold afflictedness], it would follow that the [syl­logism] is meaningless, because [afflictiveness] would not happen in an erroneous manner. [Thus,] the examples [refer to] the afflictions’ not being established independently. [Consequently,] it is not [really] the case that “the tathágata heart is the nonarising of the afflictions.”607 [This was only taught] to avoid contradictions between the Tathágata- garbhasütra and other sütras [such as the prajñápáramitá sütras].It is also noteworthy that the interlinear notes on verses 19 and 28 of SM say twice that the dharmadhátu—luminous mind—is not empty, and not just in the sense of not being empty of its inseparable qualities but obvi­ously not being empty of its own nature. For, unlike all other phenomena, it is not conditioned but is inexhaustible, unbound, and unceasing because it has the intrinsic nature of nonconceptuality.The Jonang master Kunga Drolcho s collection of 108 essential teachings from different lineages appears in volume 18 of the Treasury o f Instructions (gdams ngag mdzod) by Kongtrul Lodro Tayé.

Among these, the first two do not distin­guish between what is actual and what is nominal. The last one was spoken at the point of certainty about the ultimate by distinguish­ing between the middle and extremes and by distinguishing between phenomena and the nature of phenomena. As for retaining the mere original texts of the Dhcirmadharmatdvibhaga and the Uttaratantra, if these two texts disappeared, it would simply indicate that Maitreya has passed away into bliss.’”That this appears [in] an old notebook of Dsen Kawoche himself, which bears the name Lotus Hook, shows that one should reject the later claim that the conventional term shentong was completely un­known in India and [only] appeared later in Tibet with the Omniscient Dolpu[pa]. Also, please examine closely the statement in one of the Omniscient Buton s replies to questions that it seems that a previously existent philosophical system of Danagpa Rinchen Yeshe608 was later maintained by Dolpu[pa] by enhancing it greatly.609Obviously, with regard to the three dharmacakras, Sajjana is said here to follow the hermeneutical principle of the Samdhinirmocanasutra, with the first two cycles of the Buddha’s teachings’ being of expedient mean­ing, while the last one is of definitive meaning. Interestingly, Kunga Drol­cho goes so far as to take this as an indication that not only the teachings that were eventually referred to as Shentong, but even the term itself, were known in India.It is noteworthy in this context that the record of received teachings of the Sakya master Shuchen Tsiiltrim Rinchen (1697-1774), who was one of the editors of the Derge Tengyur and was definitely not a propo­nent of Shentong, also reports that according to Dsen Kawoche s notebook, the transmission of Shentong already existed in India:"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"144 Translators IntroductionAccording to the clear [statement] in the notebook of Dsen Kawoché, [which speaks about] the manner of even the mere texts of the two Vibhâgas and the Uttaratantra (which follow the intended meaning of the last [dharma] cakra, distinguish [the middle from] extremes, and distinguish phenomena and the nature of phenomena) being difficult to obtain, the Shentong lineage that is known to have existed in India to o .. .610As for Kunga Drolcho s saying above that Butôn referred to Dolpopa, Butôn s preserved communications with other scholars do contain a letter to someone whom he addresses as “Lama Rinchen Yeshé.” As the letter shows, Butôn obviously had great respect for Rinchen Yeshé as a nonsectar­ian and accomplished scholar. Though what Kunga Drolcho reports Butôn to have said about the connection between Rinchen Yeshé and Dolpopa is not found in this letter, what Butôn says in it about Rinchen Yeshé s view is very much in line with Dolpopa s view:In a separate letter [from Rinchen Yeshé], he declares the following... it is explained in the final [cycle of] the words of the Buddha that it is superior to the middle [cycle]. Therefore, what is stated in the final [cycle] is better... .Since the [Mahâyànajsütrâlamkâra, the Uttaratantra, and so on, are commentaries on the intention of the final [cycle of] the words of the Buddha, what is stated in them is better. Though there are certainly many who assert these [texts] to be Mere Mentalism, their meaning transcends all four philosophical systems.611In addition, Tàranàthas History o f the Kâlacakratantra reports that Dolpopa indeed received teachings (including the five works of Maitreya) from Danagpa Rinchen Yeshé (thirteenth/fourteenth century) in 1313 while staying at Danag Monastery for about three months.612 There is no doubt that this Rinchen Yeshé is the author of RYC. In its comments on Uttaratantra 1.156-67, RYC indeed says that the tathàgata heart is void of delusive, deceiving, and conditioned phenomena in all aspects.613 It also states that what the teachings in the middle wheel of dharma about all phe­nomena’s lacking real existence have in mind are seeming conditioned phe­nomena, whereas the statements in the final wheel about the sugata heart’s being real and changeless have the ultimate unconditioned dharmadhâtu in mind. Ultimately, since the stains do not exist as the nature of the mind and are adventitious, the qualities of the tathàgata heart exist by nature."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 145Through hearing about it, one develops the prajna of realizing the stains to be adventitious and the wisdom of realizing the naturally existent quali­ties.611 Also, RYC defines “adventitious” as what is primordially nonexistent or what does not taint the nature of the mind.615 Obviously, passages like these can be taken as being in accord with Dôlpopas later strong-voiced version of Shentong (though RYC does not use the term shentong or Dôl­popas specific terminologies). Still, as SM, CMW, and the texts by Mônlam Tsültrim clearly show, Rinchen Yeshé was definitely not the first one to make such statements. In addition, there are also a number of differences between Rinchen Yeshé and Dôlpopa, such as the formers asserting (like Ngog Lotsawa and others) that all sentient beings are pervaded by the dhar­makaya (or the three kàyas) as being suitable to be attained as the manifest kàyas and have the disposition of the manifest three kàyas being suitable to be attained.The Guiding Instructions on the View o f Other-Emptiness that Kunga Drôlcho (in his own words) “compiled from the instruction manual of Dsen Kawoché” (apparently the above-mentioned and now lost Lotus Hook) is a brief text that offers a glimpse into the earliest available Tibetan source for the Shentong view. Though the characteristic term shentong is not used, the texts subject matter can be easily identified in later Shentong works, such as those by Dôlpopa:As for the guiding instructions on the view of other-emptiness, after [having taken] refuge [and generated bodhi]citta as the preliminaries, [understand that] the clinging to what is mistaken as being real is the imaginary. The clinging to false imagination itself as being the entities of apprehender and apprehended is like [mistaking] a mottled rope for a snake.

[Likewise, all phenomena] from form up through omniscience, which represent con­ceptions, [arise in dependence on] karma and afflictions.The self-arisen nature of phenomena that pervades the depen­dent from the very beginning, just as space exists in a mottled rope in an all-pervasive manner, is the unmistaken perfect [nature], the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"146 Translators Introductionunchanging perfect [nature], the two rüpakáyas, the [dharmas] con­cordant with awakening, the reality of the path, and [everything] from dharmata-form up through [dharmata-]omniscience. On the conven­tional level, these are empty of the imaginary characteristic.Though [the three natures] are presented as the threefold lack of nature, if analyzed, the bearer of the nature of phenomena is the de­pendent [nature], because, apart from the mind, apprehender and apprehended do not exist. The nature of phenomena is the perfect [na­ture] alone—the sole, stainless, and spontaneously present nature of phenomena.Therefore, the imaginary is the emptiness of a nature of its own, just as the horns of a rabbit. The dependent is like an illusion, because it is empty of the imaginary. The perfect [nature] is like space, because it is empty of both the imaginary and the dependent. Though the conven­tions of the imaginary and the dependent exist seemingly, they do not exist ultimately. The perfect [nature]—the nature of phenomena—ex­ists ultimately, but it is neither one in nature with nor different from the seeming bearers of the nature of phenomena. This is the Great Madhyamaka free from all extremes.616Among the two models of the relationship between the three natures, Dsen Kawoché initially seems to describe model (1), but then he clearly spells out the Shentong model (2). The latter accords with the above ex­planations in the Brhattikd, the Árnnáyánusárini, the Šatasáhasrikáprajňá- pára?nitábrhattíká, and SM, as well as with the descriptions of the relation­ship between the three natures by Dolpopa and other Shentongpas. Also, in relating the three natures to the example of mistaking a rope for a snake, in line with many Shentong texts, Dsen Kawoché goes a step further than what the classical Yogacara texts say in terms of the perfect nature. Though he agrees in comparing the imaginary nature to the snake and the dependent nature, to the rope, he describes the perfect nature as being like the space that exists in the rope in an all-pervasive manner.617Furthermore, Dsen Kawoché describes the perfect nature not only as consisting of the classical twofold Yogacara division into the unchanging and the unmistaken perfect natures, but also including the realizations on the path and the fruition of omniscient buddhahood (thus echoing, for example, Maháyánasamgraha 11.26, which describes the perfect nature as the four pure dharmas).618 He also includes the fruitions of the sam- bhogakáya and the nirmánakáya as well as “dharmata-phenomena” (as"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"described in detail in the “Maitreya Chapter,”619 theSatasâhasrikâprajüâpâra- mitâbrhattïkâ, the Brhattïkâ, and the Bhagavatyâmnâyânusârinï). Likewise in agreement with these texts, Dsen Kawoché states that both the imaginary and the dependent natures exist only seemingly, while the perfect nature exists ultimately. Still, the perfect nature as the nature of phenomena is nei­ther the same as nor different from the dependent nature as the bearer of this nature. In conclusion, just as Dôlpopa and others later, Dsen Kawoché refers to all of this as “the Great Madhyamaka free from all extremes” and not as Yogàcàra, Vijñáptiváda, or Mere Mentalism.In fact, many Shentongpas present the difference between the two mod­els of the relationship between the three natures as one of the key distinc­tions between Shentong and what Tibetans call Mere Mentalism, which follows model (1). Besides Dsen Kawoché s above explanation, among the texts on the Uttaratantra in this volume, the Eighth Karmapas Lamp620 and CMW621 explicitly contain model (2) and Sajjanas SM (verse 9) does so implicitly. In addition, it is a typical Shentong explanation to equate the adventitious stains of the tathàgata heart with both the imaginary and the dependent natures, which is found explicitly in the Lamp622 and implicitly in Dsen s explanation, IM,623 and GISM.624In this vein, BA mentions the existence of an anonymous Tibetan commentary on the Uttaratantra that was referred to as “a tlkà on the Ut­taratantra in the tradition of Dsen” and supplemented its explanations on the text with pith instructions on meditation practice, as well as several short texts, such as RW, that contained pith instructions of the Dsen tra­dition.625 As the above fragments of Dsen s approach presented by Kunga Drôlcho show, Dsen not only used model (2) of the relationship between the three natures but also obviously connected this model of the three na­tures to the contents of the Uttaratantra. All of this represents further close connections between the teachings of the Uttaratantra and Shentong.As for Dsen Kawochés position on the tathàgata heart itself, we have only a few reports by later scholars. Sàkya Chogden says:The one who is known as Dsen Kawoché from Yarlung says that the de­finitive meaning obtained from having studied the Maitreya dharmas when he was sixty years old is that the tathàgata heart is the naturally pure wisdom—natural luminosity—that pervades [everyone] from buddhas to sentient beings.626The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 147"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"148 Translators IntroductionObviously, this is close to what the above-mentioned interlinear note on verse 28 of SM says about the tathàgata heart and also accords with the Shentong view. As mentioned before, according to BA,627 those who follow Dsen Kawoché s tradition hold that the tathàgata heart is the powerful vital cause of buddhahood since it is the naturally luminous nature of the mind. TOK agrees, saying that, according to the Eighth Situpa, the texts in Dsen Kawochés lineage accepted a really established self-aware self-luminous cognition empty of the duality of apprehender and apprehended to be the powerful vital cause of buddhahood.628In addition, Gô Lotsàwas GC states that, according to the followers of Dsen, the difficult situations of sickness and so on can be made into the path through pith instructions (as stated above, Dsen originally requested teachings on the Uttaratantra from Sajjana as his instructions to be prac­ticed at the time of death).629It seems clear from GC and elsewhere630 that Gô Lotsâwa did not agree with Dolpopa s particular kind of Shentong. However, Gô Lotsâwa s BA still remarks positively that there are people who claim that Dolpopa is wrong in asserting the tathàgata heart to be really existent and permanent, but it appears that it is due to his kindness that there are many in Tibet who take the Uttaratantra as their yidam (that is, they take this text as the most im­portant basis for their practice).631Although none of Gô Lotsàwas preserved texts use the term shentong, some of GCs explanations can definitely be read as being in accordance with a Shentong approach. The clearest example is GCs introductory expla­nation of the fourth vajra point,632 which distinguishes two kinds of emp­tiness—the one that is a nonimplicative negation and the one that is basic awareness, with the latter ones representing the supreme Madhyamaka. The emptiness explained in the second dharma wheel is the nonimplicative negation of being empty of any nature, which is to be realized through in­ferential valid cognition. It is also described as not having arisen from any causes or conditions. In the last dharma wheel, this kind of emptiness refers only to the outer cocoon of adventitious stains, while the emptiness that represents the tathàgata heart is as follows. The tathàgata hearts own es­sence is not a nonimplicative negation but the element of basic awareness. It is not a direct object of inferential valid cognition but is the object of direct perception. Just like space, the basic element does not depend on any changes through contact with other phenomena. Also, the object of nega­tion of which something is empty is a bit different here than in the second dharma wheel. The tathàgata heart exists from sentient beings up through"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Meditative Tradition o f the Uttaratantra and Shentong 149buddhas as the nature of the mind by way of not being impaired or being fabricated by any other conditions, while it is said to be empty of all fabri­cated adventitious phenomena (this is the closest GC comes to saying that the tathágata heart is “empty of something other”). Still, these adventitious phenomena are not something that is apart from the nature of the mind. This is similar to spaces being described as empty because it does not turn into clouds, mountains, and so on, while at the same time, it is not tenable for clouds and so on to abide anywhere else than in space. Moreover, since the outer world and the bodies of sentient beings are brought about by ig­norance, they too are fabricated and thus also represent objects of negation of which the tathágata heart is empty. Still, buddhas do not see this element of basic awareness as having any characteristic whatsoever. Maitrlpa, the lord of the Uttaratantra, and his successors assert that the emptiness taught in the Madhyamakávatára represents middling Madhyamaka, while the emptiness that is basic awareness is the system of supreme Madhyamaka.In conclusion, it is obvious from a straightforward reading of the general contents of the Uttaratantra and R G W that these texts lend themselves greatly and easily to a Shentong interpretation—the main themes being that the tathágata heart is empty of what is other than it but is not empty of its own nature. This is particularly clear in the contents of Uttaratan­tra 1.155, RGVV’s corresponding quotes from the Šrlmáladevisňtra, and R G W s passage “Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accordance with actual reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real existent.”Nevertheless, it seems important to point out that (in line with Uttaratan­tra 1.156-60 and JKCs introduction above) the teachings on the tathágata heart in the Uttaratantra and related texts (as in the Shentong tradition) are not a total rejection of the teachings on emptiness or Madhyamaka (in the sense of Rangtong), but they have a different thrust—how to approach the direct experience of minds empty yet luminous nature in practice. Thus, one could say that the teachings on buddha nature speak about what hap­pens after having used Madhyamaka reasoning and not instead of using such reasoning. Though both Dolpopa and many later Shentongpas actu­ally said that Shentong includes, and is based on, Rangtong as a form of analytical rigor but supersedes this level of discourse, a significant number of later Shentongpas argued for the supremacy of Shentong even on the level of philosophical analysis (which is vehemently denied by their op­ponents). However, all disputes about Rangtong and Shentong are rather pointless as long as these notions are regarded as belonging to the same"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"150 Translators Introductionlevel of discourse, experience, and realization, and to be mutually exclusive on that same level. Instead, any fruitful conversation about Rangtong and Shentong can start only from acknowledging that they pertain to different levels. As Ruegg (2000, 80-81) says:One could assume an incompatibility, at one and the same level of ref­erence, between two philosophical propositions, both of which cannot be true in accordance with the principle of contradiction. Alterna­tively, one might perhaps suppose a complementarity—perhaps even an incommensurability—between two doctrines that relate to different levels of reference or discourse, and which are accordingly not mutu­ally exclusive or contradictory.That is why, following Sakya Chogden, many (also contemporary) so-called “nonexclusive” Shentongpas say that Rangtong is supreme for cutting through all wrong views, reifications, and reference points, while Shentong is more amenable to, and beneficial for, describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization. They teach that the views of Rang­tong and Shentong are not only not contradictory but—when understood properly—supplement each other and are one in terms of the definitive meaning."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and MahamudraAs stated before, texts such as CMW, those by Monlam Tsiiltrim, GC, the Eighth Karmapas Lamp, and GISM all establish connections between the Uttaratantra and Mahamudra. Such connections are also found in a num­ber of Indian and Tibetan Mahamudra works. Usually, these connections are made in the wider context of the Mahamudra approaches that came to be called “sutra Mahamudra” or “essence Mahamudra” (the Mahamudra approach that is beyond “sutra Mahamudra” and “tantra Mahamudra”). In order to provide some background against which the Uttaratantra-based Mahamudra instructions in the above texts can be appreciated more fully, I will next present an overview of the key elements of the different ap­proaches to Mahamudra, their origins, their scriptural sources, and the dif­ferent ways in which they are taught.Sutra Mahamudra, Tantra Mahamudra, and Essence MahamudraTOKs explanation of the stages of the path of Mahamudra, which relies in significant parts on Go Lotsawas BA and GC, is the most systematic pre­sentation of the three approaches to Mahamudra that are traceable since the time of Maitripa and came to be called “sutra Mahamudra,” “tantra Mahamudra,” and “essence Mahamudra” from the time of Jamgon Kong- tml Lodro Taye (1813-1899) onward.633 Therefore, TOKs discussion is pre­sented here first as an overview of these three approaches. TOK begins by dividing Mahamudra into its two main approaches of sutra and tantra:Since this widely renowned “Incomparable Tagpo Kagyii” is not merely a lineage of words, it is called “the ultimate lineage of true reality.”634 The meaning of this is that it is an unbroken lineage of the realization of stainless Mahamudra. Therefore, this practice lineage has not dete­riorated right up to the present [in that it is alive] in the root guru from whom one obtains the realization of Mahamudra. Thus, Mahamudra— the instruction that is greatly renowned in this precious lineage—is known as two [systems]. In the one that accords with the sutra system,151"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"152 Translators Introductionone rests in meditative equipoise through being instructed that the sub­ject does not mentally engage in the object—luminosity free from ref­erence points. The mantra system is the Connate Union635 Mahâmudrâ of bliss and emptiness in unison, which is made special through the wisdom that arises from empowerment636 and through striking the vital points in the vajra body.637Then TOK explains the origins of sütra Mahâmudrâ, the crucial roles of Maitripa and Gampopa in its development, and its being squarely based on the Uttaratantra:In the teachings of Tagpo Rinpoche,638 it is said:The text for this Mahâmudrâ of ours is the Mahâyânottaratantra- sastra composed by the Bhagavàn Maitreya.After the mighty lord Maitripa had obtained the instructions of the great Brahman [Saraha] and his successors, he composed pith instruc­tions on prajnàpàramità that accord with mantra, such as the Tattva- dasaka. Having heard them, lord Marpa said:The heart of the matter of the ultimate yàna,Mental nonengagement free from extremes,Shall be pointed out as the dharma that is Mahâmudrâ.This is the scriptural system asserted by lord Maitripa.Also Milarepa said:Right now in the gap between samsàra and nirvâna,The basic nature being pointed out is Mahâmudrâ.Please determine the view that is the ground.The meaning of [all] these [statements] is as follows. The manner of the view and meditation of this [sütra Mahâmudrâ is stated in the Uttaratantra]:There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahdmudra 153Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.639The Uttaratantra continues:The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.640Therefore, in this luminous nature of the mind, there are no stains to be removed because its nature is primordially without stains. Nor are there the slightest previously nonexistent qualities to be produced and added because its essence consists of intrinsic qualities since the be­ginning. As for the reasons for this, the basic element is empty of the fabricated and adventitious stains that have the characteristic of being suitable to be separated from the [tathagata] heart. The basic element is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes—the buddha qualities (such as the ten powers)—whose nature is unfabricated and that have the characteristic of being inseparable [from it].For example, this is as in the case when a [white] conch appears to be yellow due to a bile disease; the conch is empty of being yellow but is not empty of being white. Therefore, both the wish to remove stains and the wish to add qualities are obscurations due to thoughts of hope and fear. Hence, having relinquished these [wishes], through person­ally experienced prajna, one should view and familiarize with just this actual true reality—the present ordinary mind (appearance and emp­tiness inseparable, free from being real or delusive)—as being precisely that, without contriving it or tampering with it through adopting and rejecting. “Viewing” refers to knowing and viewing through prajna. “Familiarizing” refers to resting right within that [true reality] in a one- pointed manner without being distracted. This way of being is [also] stated and clarified by venerable Rangjung [Dorje]:All is neither real nor delusive—Held to be like [a reflection of] the moon in water by the learned.Just this ordinary mindIs called “dharmadhatu” and “heart of the victors.”611"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"154 Translators IntroductionTherefore, glorious Kachô [Wangpo]642 says:This sheer lucid awareness that appears at the present timeIs the own essence of phenomena—seeming reality.If you understand it as the uncontrived essential point just as it is,Ultimate reality is also nothing but this.The two realities of those dealing with the conventions of textsAbound with scriptures and reasonings, but they do not understand the essential point.Through taking the two to be different, they deviate from nonduality.Thus, seeming reality consists of the adventitious stains, which resem­ble [the appearance of] yellow based on a [white] conch. Ultimate re­ality is the tathagata heart, which resembles the white of that conch. [However,] these are only mere appearances from the perspective of mistakenness (the subject), whereas there is no yellow or white to be removed or added in terms of the conch [itself] (the object). Therefore, the pith instruction [here] is to rest naturally settled in an uncontrived manner.In brief, what are called “samsara” and “nirvana” are [only] presented from the perspective of mere seeming appearances, while the nature of both of them, which is free from reference points and is luminous, is called “sugata heart.” Hence, in terms of the definitive meaning, mere appearances and their nature cannot be distinguished individually, just like a fire and its heat. For this reason, also the Mother says:Form is empty. Emptiness is form ....Venerable Rangjung [Dorje] states:The basic nature free from reference points, Mahâmudrâ,Is empty of all characteristics of the reference points of thoughts.This pure nature, lucid and yet without grasping,Is also called “the tathàgata heart.”643"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 155Next, TOK defends the approach of sutra Mahamudra against the common claim of Mahamudras not being found in the sutras, while any genuine form of Mahamudra must be based on tantric empowerments. TOK rejects this critique, which was first leveled by Sakya Pandita, through referring to two Indian sources that speak about Mahamudra in relation to the approach of the sutras. In addition, the text refers to two of Atisa s works and other Kadampa teachings as being major sources of sutra Mahamudra besides the tradition of Maitripa and the Uttaratantra mentioned above.About this, the dharma lord Sakya Pandita asserted that the conven­tional term “Mahamudra” is absent in the prajnaparamita system and that the wisdom of Mahamudra arises solely from empowerments.644 Following that, [some] great ones uttered a lot of meaningless chatter, but in the Tattvdvatdra composed by master Jnanakirti, it says:Another name of Mother Prajnaparamita is Mahamudra because it is the very nature of nondual wisdom.645Thus, he not only explains that the prajnaparamita taught in the sutras and the Mahamudra of mantra are synonyms, but he also explains these conventional terms:As for those of highest capacities among the persons who exert themselves in the paramitas, when they perform the meditations of calm abiding and superior insight, even at the stage of ordi­nary beings, this grants them the true realization characterized by having its origin in Mahamudra. Thus, this is the sign of irre­versible [realization] . . . 646Sahajavajra also explains this in a similar way, which will be found below. That Tagpo Rinpoche gave rise to the realization of Mahamudra even in beginners who had not obtained empowerment is [precisely] this system of paramita [Mahamudra]. It consists primarily of instruc­tions that come from the Kadampas. The Pith Instructions on the Two Armors of Connate Union Mahamudra, composed by lord [Atisa] and this present tradition accord in all respects, and even the progression of the four yogas [of Mahamudra] is clearly taught in that [text].647 Thus, it is said that [Gampopa] guided the majority in his assembly [of students] through the stages of the path that come from the Kadam"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"156 Translators Introduction[tradition], while he guided the extraordinary [students] through the path of means that comes from guru Milarepa. Among these [two ap­proaches, sütra Mahàmudrà] represents the meaning of the former [approach].

Nowadays, from the perspective of those who are to be guided in this degenerate age and are fond of very high yànas, venerable Gampopa and the protector Pamo Trupa applied the name “Connate Union Mahàmudrà” to the system of guidance through calm abiding and superior insight that is in common with the causal yàna of the pàramitàs—the pith instructions of the Bodhipathapradipa transmitted by the protector Atisa.648Nevertheless, in the approach to practice of most heart sons of Tagpo [Rinpoche], the instructions on Mahàmudrà are taught in such a way that they are preceded by conferring an empowerment. Thus, they hold [Mahàmudrà] to be the approach that is common to sütra and mantra.649TOK also divides Mahàmudrà into the three approaches of sütra Mahàmudrà, tantra Mahàmudrà, and essence Mahàmudrà. Here, sütra Mahàmudrà is explained in terms of ground, path, and fruition, which en­tail its view, meditation, and conduct.The essence of the first is prajnàpàramità, its name is Mahàmudrà,And its aspects are in accordance with mantra.The first of these three traditions is the sütra tradition or this [tra­dition] that later came to be held as the Mahàmudrà of blending the realizations of sütra and mantra. It corresponds to what the Tattva- dasakatïkâ composed by master Sahajavajra clearly explains as the wis­dom that realizes suchness and has the three features of its essences being pàramità, being in accordance with mantra, and its name being “Mahàmudrà.”650"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 1571. Teaching ground Mahâmudrâ, the basic nature that is the fundamental ground of [all] entitiesThis has three parts:1. The actual way of being2. The way of being mistaken3. Pointing out the own essence of the way it is1.1. The actual way of beingThe ground is the basic nature without bias, free from extremes of reference points,Never mistaken or liberated, and all-pervasive like space.The ground, the basic nature that is the fundamental ground of [all] entities, is not established as the essence of either samsàra or nirvàna, does not exhibit any bias in any direction whatsoever, and is free from all extremes of reference points (such as existence, nonexistence, permanence, and extinction). Therefore, it is beyond being an object of speech, thought, and expression and is primordially never bound through mistakenness or liberated through being realized. Due to the essential point of its not being established as any specifically character­ized phenomenon whatsoever, it pervades all phenomena of samsàra and nirvàna like space. This basic nature is taught in the sütras and tantras through many synonyms, such as Mahâmudrâ, prajnàpàramità, sugata heart, primordial buddha, and causal tantra. This nonduality of profundity and lucidity651—ultimate reality, the pure basis of pu­rification, and the very essence of the mind—that has been explained already and will be explained [further] represents the basic nature of [all] that is to be known.1.2. The way of being mistakenThe way of being mistaken is to appear but be without reality—Through the creative display of this naturally pure luminosity, the vaj- ra of mind, not being aware of its own essence, the [afflicted] mind stirs from the àlaya.

As for the way of being mistaken, since seeming reality—the adventitious stains that are to be purified—is not present within the fundamental ground, it appears but is not established as be­ing real. Therefore, one is able to become liberated through the remedy of [basic awareness] recognizing its own face.1.3. Pointing out the own essence of the way it isThis mere appearance itself,In its triad of arising, abiding, and ceasing, is the great play of the three kayas.All of samsara and nirvana arises from the play of the mind. Through the power of this very [play] naturally abiding as the union of lucidity and emptiness, this mere appearance itself is the great play of the three kayas free from the triad of arising, abiding, and ceasing. Its unborn fun­damental ground is the dharmakaya, its unceasing radiance is the sam- bhogakaya, and its creative display arising as anything whatsoever is the nirmanakaya. Through recognizing the own essence of the way it is— that these three are all spontaneously present primordially as being in­separable in essence—all phenomena are free from affirming, negating, adopting, and rejecting in that they [simply] are the wheel of the natural state, suchness, the infinite expanse. This is the recognition of the own essence of the view of Mahamudra—the basic nature that is the ground.2.

(1) What makes the meditation that has not arisen arise is the training in the four654 preliminaries. (2) What makes [the meditation] that has arisen into the path is the threefold pointing-out instruction. (3) [Fi­nally, there is] the manner of enhancing this and giving rise to qualities.(1) One trains in the stages of the path common to Kadampa and Mahâmudrâ—the four [reflections] that turn the mind away [from samsàra]—as well as [taking] refuge, [giving rise to] bodhicitta, accu­mulation [of merit], purification [of obscurations], and guru yoga un­til the signs [of accomplishment] come forth.655 In that way, one should make the mind turn into the dharma and the dharma into the path.656(2) The Tantra of Inconceivable Connateness657 [says]:Connate mind as such is the dharmakàya.[Connate thoughts are the display of the dharmakàya.]658Connate appearances are the light of the dharmakàya.The inseparability of appearances and mind is the connate.There arose limitless vajra discourses of the mighty lords of accom­plishment commenting on the meaning of this [quote]. Accordingly, it is held that [all Mahâmudrâ pointing-out instructions] are subsumed under pointing-out the threefold connate. Among these, (a) natural con­nate mind as such is the dharmakàya.

Through these ways of resting, all the discursiveness of thoughts of the three times is self-liberated and is at peace in the nature of phenomena. This is the meaning of the three doors to liberation.2.2. Cutting off the treacherous paths of strayings and deviationsOne is liberated from the four cases of deviation and the three cases of straying.When one meditates in this way, one is liberated from [the following]. To cling to all phenomena as being empty is to deviate [from emptiness as] the fundamental ground. When one has gained a little bit of un­derstanding and experience of emptiness, to be satisfied with just that much and thus discontinue accumulation and purification is to deviate from emptiness [by mistaking it] as the path. To take emptiness as the path and then hope for a result at a later time is to deviate [from emp­tiness by mistaking it as] a remedy, without understanding that [all] factors to be relinquished and their remedies are inseparable. [One can also] deviate [from emptiness] in the form of sealing appearances with emptiness in a mentally fabricated manner.660 These are the four cases of deviation in relation to superior insight.If one clings to the three [experiences] of bliss, clarity, and nonthought, they become cases of straying [from the path] and circling in the corresponding ones among the three realms of samsara.661 These are the three cases of straying in relation to calm abiding.2.3.

Furthermore, [Mahamudra medi­tation] is beyond being the objects of the three [kinds of] prajna—the objects understood through study, the experiences through reflection, and the experiential appearances through meditation. Through arriv­ing at the essential point of meditation s being untouched by any men­tal states of the three great ones,664 one makes the connection through three ways of arising (gradual arising, in leaps, and all at once) and thus will effortlessly traverse the inner paths and bhumis through the four stages of yoga (one-pointedness, freedom from reference points, one taste, and nonmeditation), each of which is divided into lesser, me­dium, and great, thus making twelve.As for these four stages of yoga, in The Tantra of [the Great River of] the Inconceivable Secret ofAli Kali,665 we find:Through the samadhi of the lion s sport,666Unmoving, one-pointed, and clear cognition becomes lucid,And self-aware wisdom is awakened from within.Stable, poised readiness relinquishes the suffering of the lower realms.Second, through the illusion-like samadhi,667In the great meditative equipoise free from reference points,The inconceivable dawns as the display of samadhi.Having attained heat represents power over birth.Third, through the samadhi of heroic stride,668 The realization of the one taste of the many on the ten bhumis arises,And the children of the buddhas of the three times promote the welfare of others.Having attained the peak, increase is uninterrupted.Fourth, through the vajra-like samadhi,669 Due to effort in the practice of nonmeditation,[All-]knowing wisdom sees the buddha realms."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"162 Translators IntroductionThis is the state of the spontaneously present great supreme dharma without seeking.670With the same intention, [the four yogas] are also taught in detail in the Lankâvatàrasütra,671 and their meaning, which was clearly explained by the great masters Padmasambhava, [Ratnàkara]sànti, Nâropa, and others, was elaborated greatly by the protector Dao Shonnu.... If the meaning of the various ways of explaining [the four yogas through] these and other presentations is summarized, it corresponds to what the Omniscient Chennga Chokyi Tragpa672 says:As for the four yogas in this context, according to the tradition of guidance in the Mahàmudrà of the mantra system, they are explained as the very wisdom of Mahàmudrà that represents the essence of the four joys of descending from above and sta­bilizing from below.

This is the fruition—buddha is found within the mind. Through meeting the own face of the three kàyas, dharmakàya Mahâmudrâ is no [longer] an aspiration for a later time but is attained right now.As for these stages of the path [of Mahâmudrâ], in accordance with Tagpo Rinpoches dream visions and Milarepa s prophecies, [Tagpo Rin­poche] said, “I can benefit many beings through this Kadampa dharma too” and “Even the slightest benefit I have accomplished for sentient be­ings now represents [nothing but] the kindness of the Kadampa gurus.” Also, he [once] dreamt that, through him beating a drum, many deer [came to] listen and he distributed milk to them.673 All this and more represents the meaning of this approach of guidance. For the meaning of these [statements and dreams] is that, due to having reached the time when the degenerations are rampant,674 those who have the extraordi­nary good fortune [of being suitable for] the vajrayâna have become very few. However, by virtue of [initially] guiding those to be guided who have duller faculties and are of lesser fortune through the stages of the path of the three [types of] individuals,675 they finally evolve into [disciples] of supreme fortune and thus become extraordinary vessels for the mantra [approach]. That is, they attain liberation in a single life­time or, even if not, many of them will see the actuality of Mahâmudrâ through this method and thus will be established on the irreversible path. This is the intention behind [all] of this.676Therefore, beginning with venerable [Gampopa] himself up through the present, there has been the practice system of guiding everyone to be guided, be they of greater or lesser fortune, without discrimination through this approach of guidance. In addition to this, the fortunate are taught the profound path of means of the mantra [system], and at that time these [instructions here] are given the names “instructions at the time of the cause” or “basic guidance.” On this point, the great venerable one from Jonang677 says:Nov/adays what is known as the Mahâmudrâ that is the basic natureIs a progression of meditation in the sütra system of the final wheel.By virtue of the progression of faculties, it [also] conforms with mantraAnd therefore becomes like a lamp for beings."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"164 Translators IntroductionIt corresponds to the three appearances of the followers of the Path with the Result and so on.678As for tantra Mahamudra (“the Mahamudra of great bliss”), TOK says that it comes from the Yoganuttara679 class of tantra, being based on the path of means, such as the highest empowerment, self-blessing, and the stages of mudra.680 Thus, tantra Mahamudra is realized through practicing methods such as the Six Dharmas of Naropa. In particular, the ultimate view and realization in the Uttaratantra, the vajrayana, and Madhyamaka are said to be necessarily the same:The meaning [of these instruction] is summarized in [the phrase] “Seize luminosity within appearances.” When the thoughts of clinging to appearances as being [real] entities have become pure through ones being skilled in this method, all appearances become empty forms. However, the empty forms such as smoke681 . . . are merely signs and indications on the path of means that makes one realize this very ba­sic nature that was not realized [before]. The actual ultimate object to be realized is definitely that just these ordinary present appearances are empty forms in every respect. Therefore, both [the teaching] in the Uttaratantra that there is nothing to be removed from, and nothing to be added to, the tathagata heart and the teaching on the manner of familiarizing with the Mahamudra of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness in the mantra [system] must be the same as the basic nature of the view that is Madhyamaka. The eighth lord [Mikyo Dorje] and his successors hold that the Madhyamaka view is nothing but this:To say “existence” is the clinging to682 permanence.To say “nonexistence” is the view of extinction.Therefore, the learned should not dwell In either existence or nonexistence.683AndNeither existent, nor nonexistent, [nor] neither existent nor nonexistent,Nor having the character of both—Being liberated from the four extremes Is what is realized by Madhyamikas.684"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 165As for essence Mahàmudrà, TOK explains that the path of realizing the profound essence with sudden force is more profound than both sütra and tantra Mahàmudrà.685 Merely through the descending of the blessings of the vajra wisdom empowerment conferred by gurus with realization upon fortunate students of the very sharpest faculties, ordinary mind is awakened in the middle of their hearts and thus realization and liberation become simultaneous. Therefore, since this path does not depend on elaborate means and efforts in training, it is nothing but the direct appearance of the liberating life examples of the siddhas of the Kagyü lineages reaching infinitely great levels of realization in an immediate manner.686As already mentioned, at the time of Tagpo Dashi Namgyal687 (1512— 1587), in practice, Mahàmudrà in the Kagyü tradition is often explained and practiced as a blend of sütra, tantra, and essence Mahàmudrà. Among the major Karma Kagyü Mahàmudrà works, Tagpo Dashi Namgyal’s Moonbeams of Mahàmudrà is considered to be a sütra Mahàmudrà text; the works on the Six Dharmas of Nâropa and the Hevajratantra, tantra Mahàmudrà texts; and the Ninth Karmapas Ocean o f Definitive Meaning, an essence Mahàmudrà text.The Sütra Sources of MahàmudràTo provide scriptural support for the approach of sütra Mahàmudrà, the Kagyü tradition lists a number of sütras and nontantric Indian treatises (for the latter, see below). Within the Tibetan tradition, Gampopa is unan­imously considered to be a reincarnation of Candraprabhakumàra,688 the bodhisattva who was the main interlocutor of the Buddha in the Samâdhirâjasütra and who stepped forward as the only volunteer to pre­serve and propagate its teachings in the age of degeneration (that is, our present times). The Buddha promised to help him do that and is said to have been reborn eventually as Gampopa s student Pamo Trupa.689 Thus, the Kagyü School regards the Samâdhirâjasütra as one of the main founda­tions of Gampopa s Mahàmudrà approach (this approach is sometimes also referred to as the hidden or secret path of the sütras since the actual method of Mahàmudrà meditation is hidden in the sütra teachings). In addition, the Samâdhirâjasütra is the main sütra source quoted and referred to in one of the key Indian texts of Kagyü Mahàmudrà, the Tattvadasakatïkâ by Sahajavajra, one of the four main students of Maitrlpa.According to BA, the famous Kadampa master Potowa Rinchen Sal690 (1027-1105), one of the main students of Dromtônpa Gyalwé Jungné691"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"i66 Translators Introduction(1005-1064), agreed on the connection between the Samàdhirajasütra and Mahâmudrâ, saying:There is something that is called Mahâmudrâ at present, which is the meaning of the Samâdhirâjasütra. We should neither put it down nor engage in it.”692However, this statement in all likelihood did not refer to Gampopa because the latter only began teaching at Gampo in 1121, having stayed in meditation retreat before then. It may have referred to Maitrlpa’s Mahâmudrâ and the dohà tradition spread by his student Vajrapâni during the 1070s in Tibet.Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, the present tutor of the seventeenth Kar­mapa, says that the Samâdhirâjasütra is related to Mahâmudrâ through its actual intent rather than through its literal meaning,693 and thatwhen the great master Gampopa . . . expounded the Mahamudra sys­tem he only used this sütra. We can find clear statements to this effect in his life story, as well as in many of his songs and teachings. . . . Ac­cordingly, from the time of Gampopa . . . until today, there has been an unbroken lineage of advice on the method of teaching Mahamudra based on this sütra.. .. When the 16th Gyalwang Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, established the Nalanda Institute at Rumtek Monastery, he personally selected the treatises to be included in the standard cur­riculum. . . . His Holiness included the King of Samadhi Sütra in this curriculum as the supportive scripture for Mahamudra.694In his Moonbeams o f M ahâmudrâ,695 Tagpo Dashi Namgyal addi­tionally provides certain passages in the following sütras as sources of Mahâmudrâ—the Sâgaramatipariprcchàsütra, Maitreyaprasthànasütra, Gaganagañjapariprcchdsütra, Ratnadârikâpariprcchàsütra, Bhadrakalpika- sütra, and Varmavyühanirdesasütra.

From him, he received what TOK calls “es­sence Mahamudra,”698 and later Savaripa told him to go back to academia and “teach the acaryas how things really are.” Due to his vast training in the sutrayana, the vajrayana, and essence Mahamudra, Maitripa was able to de­velop his unique approach of blending the sutra teachings of the mahayana with tantric elements and the pith instructions of the mahasiddhas. In this way, the teachings of essence Mahamudra, which had hitherto been passed on within the wandering community of lay siddhas outside of monastic and academic institutions, found entrance into mainstream Indian Bud­dhism and thus became accessible to many more people. Naturally, this did not happen without some controversies. However, by combining his ad­vanced spiritual realization of Mahamudra with his prior scholarly training in sophisticated terminology and instructions, Maitripa was able to spread Mahamudra in his former world of the Buddhist monastic and scholarly establishment. It happened there that Maitripa was victorious over the tlrthika Natikara in debate, who thus became one of his four main disciples, henceforth known as Sahajavajra. Later, Maitripa stayed in solitary retreat in the charnel ground Mount Blazing like Fire, where he, according to Pawo Tsugla Trengwa, composed his “cycle of twenty-five works on mental non­engagement (amanasikara)”699Maitrlpas paramita-based teachings on Mahamudra are designed to enable even beginners to practice with direct insights into the luminous nature of the mind, that is, outside the requirements of the classic tantric path, such as having to receive empowerments and practicing the various levels of the generation and completion stages.700 Maitrlpa’s system teaches a swift path to awakening with the help of pith instructions and blessings of the guru, which is accessible even for ordinary people. Although Mai- trlpa’s own texts in his “cycle on mental nonengagement” freely employ several tantric terms and notions in not specifically tantric contexts, the term “Mahamudra” itself is only rarely found. Far more frequent are ex­pressions familiar from the doha tradition, such as “true reality” (tattva), “union” (yuganaddha), “connateness” (sahaja), “nondual” (advaya), “great bliss” (mahasukha), “natural luminosity” (prabhasvara/prakasa), and, of course, Maitrlpas key term “mental nonengagement.” Among the five"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"i68 Translators Introductionworks701 in his cycle of works on mental nonengagement in which the word “Mahàmudrà” appears, the Caturmudràniscaya provides the most detailed explanation of the term and the clearest link to both the sütras and the no­tion of “mental nonengagement.” The text glosses Mahàmudrà as follows:ÀH “Mahàmudrà”—Mahàmudrà is what is both great and mudrà. Mahàmudrà is the lack of nature and freedom from obscurations, such as cognitive [obscurations]. (In its stainlessness,) it resembles the sunlit autumn sky at noon. It serves as the basis for all perfect excellence, is the single nature (beyond the extremes) of samsàra and nirvàna, the embodiment of nonreferential compassion, and the single nature of great bliss. Accordingly, [the sütras] say:The dharmas of mental nonengagement are virtuous. The dhar- mas of mental engagement are nonvirtuous.702[The Sarvabuddhavisayàvatàrajnànàlokàlamkârasütra states]:I pay homage to you who are without imaginary thoughts, whose mind does not abide [on anything],Who are without mindfulness, mentally nonengaged, and with­out focal object.703This is understood as “Mahàmudrà.” Through that Mahàmudrà, whose nature is inconceivable, the fruition called “samayamudrà” is born.704The commentary by Bhitakarma, one of Maitripas students, explains that Mahàmudrà is the fruition of the other three mudràs.705 “ÀH” refers to being without arising throughout the triad of cause, path, and fruition. Arising due to dependent origination and being without arising are not different. “Mudrà” has the meaning of not going beyond—one cannot go beyond it by way of example, existence, or being something. It is like space. “Great” means that it is superior to the three other mudràs—karmamudrà, jnànamudrà, and samayamudrà.706 The reasons to present Mahàmudrà as the fruition are as follows. What is called “the very essence of the lack of nature, devoid of superimposition and denial” should be known as Mahàmudrà. The lack of nature means being free from stains—all kinds of momentary aspects including the clinging to them, karmic maturations including examination and analysis, and apprehender and apprehended."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 169For example, from all kinds of different firewood, a single flame arises and does not remain once the wood is consumed. Likewise, Mahamudra is the single flame that arises from the variety of phenomena—they are realized to be without arising—but thereafter they are not even apprehended as the mere lack of arising. In fact, they are not apprehended as anything whatso­ever. Realizing that is buddhahood, which depends on just that realization. Since one speaks of “perfect buddhahood in a single instant,” it is reason­able to be free from any engagement in negating and affirming. How is this Mahamudra? It is the lack of hope since it is the very “freedom from obscurations”—both cognitive and afflictive. There is no hope for a rem­edy—wishing that the six páramitás (such as generosity) relinquish their respective opposites (such as avarice). There is also no hope for true re­ality-thinking that some fruition is attained through training well in the generation and completion stages. Nor is there any hope for a fruition— thinking that the fruition of buddhahood is attained from somewhere out­side. This is because all afflictions are mastered by it, the suchness of all phenomena cannot be cultivated, and great bliss exists intrinsically. “The sunlit autumn sky at noon” that is not disturbed by clouds, rainbows, mist, fog, 01* storms is without arising, lacks a nature of its own, includes past, present, and future times, is primordially unchanging, and pervades all of samsara. Likewise, Mahamudra lacks any arising by its nature and lacks any nature of existence, nonexistence, both, or neither. All times—being in samsara, training on the path, and having revealed Mahamudra—are nothing but Mahamudra. Everything possible appears from it, but it never changes in the slightest, just as space remains unaltered by clouds and so on that appear in it or water remains unaffected by waves and silt.Just as sesame oil pervades its seeds, Mahamudra pervades samsara. However, samsara is nothing but the appearance of Mahamudra; it is not such that there is a pervader and something pervaded. Mahamudra’s “serving as the basis for all perfect excellence” refers to the qualities of the dharmakaya (being free from superimposition and denial), sambhogakáya (experience), nirmánakáya (appearing in all kinds of ways), and svábhá- vikakáya (the single nature of the natural state), all of which abide within ones own experience.707 This is fresh, natural, and relaxed. In other words, it is the source of all happiness in samsara and the great bliss of nirvána.708 Mahamudra is pure, supreme, and inconceivable. Purity means that it “is the single nature of samsara and nirvana,” which is effortless, that is, pri­mordial buddhahood. Supreme refers to the union of bliss and emptiness, free from the extremes of permanence and extinction. It is inconceivable"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"170 Translators Introductionin that it lacks any kind of distraction. This experience of nonreferentiality is an unceasing flow like a river and thus cannot be divided into a duality of samsára and nirvana. Mahámudrás being “the embodiment of nonref- erential compassion” means that, through the power of such compassion and extraordinary aspiration prayers, true reality itself manifests as the two rüpakáyas. Still, true reality and those two káyas are not different but have “the single nature of great bliss,” which is free from superimposition and denial and is the káya of mental nonengagement.Bhitakarma also says that the great bliss of Mahámudrá exists intrinsi­cally in all sentient beings and that its realization means to see ones own nature by oneself, whereas those who delight in contaminated bliss due to being mistaken about this basic nature are fools.709As for Maitrlpa s hallmark term “mental nonengagement,” it is also dis­cussed by Kamalaslla in his Bhávanákramas and his Avikalpapravešatiká as being the final fruition of the practice of superior insight based on Madhya­maka reasoning. However, its Mahámudrá meaning of not only being the process of letting go of dualistic conceptualization but also being a direct nonanalytical approach to realizing minds natural luminosity is primarily known from the dohás of Saraha and also appears in some dohás by Tilopá and others.710 Still, Maitrlpa is certainly the one who discusses this term in the greatest detail, due to which his entire approach later came to be identi­fied with this term. Maitrlpa’s Amanasikárádhára justifies its use in the Bud­dhist teachings and clearly explains its meaning, combining a broad range of Indian scholarly approaches with the vajrayana language of meditative experience, which is so typical of many of Maitrlpa s works.711 First, he pres­ents some grammatical considerations and then traces the term back to both the sütras and tantras, providing the above quotes from the prajñápáramitá sütras and the Sarvabuddhavisayávatárajñánálokálamkárasütra, as well as a phrase from the Avikalpapravešadháranl:Once bodhisattva mahásattvas have relinquished all aspects of charac­teristics of conceptions through not mentally engaging [in them] .. .712Though the term “mental nonengagement” is not found in the tantras, Maitrlpa quotes two verses from the Hevajratantra:Neither ... mind nor mental factors exist by virtue of a nature of their own.713"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 171And:Therefore, one meditates on the whole world [in this way],Wherefore one does not meditate with the mind (manasd).714Maitripa concludes that this means that one meditates by way of mental nonengagement.He also says that mental nonengagement is not a nonimplicative nega­tion since it refers to negating all mental engagement that exists in terms of apprehender and apprehended and so on but does not negate mind as such. What that term teaches is the complete transcending of all conceptions. Nevertheless, to regard it as an implicative negation is without flaw—re­ferring to an awareness that lacks any nature is the understanding of those Madhyamikas who speak of illusion-like nonduality. When one calls that awareness illusion-like or not truly established, this is not a negation of ex­istence altogether—it is not that it does not exist at all. Obviously, this pre­sentation of a lucid yet nonreified awareness remaining after all dualistic mental activity has ceased corresponds well to the Uttaratantra's formula of the tathagata hearts being empty of adventitious stains but not being empty of its intrinsic qualities, as well as to later formulations of shentong in the sense of an implicative negation.Then, Maitripa gives two very special etymologies of amanasikara. (1) He says that the (correct) mental engagement (manasikara) in primar­ily the letter “A” is mental nonengagement (a-manasikara). That kind of mental engagement means that everything is “A”—primordially unborn, since “A” is the seed syllable of identitylessness (this is supported by quotes from the tantras to that effect—Hevajratantra 1.2.1. and II.4.22a, as well as Mahjusnnamasamgiti V.lc-2b). Hence, all such mental engagement refers to the lack of nature. (2) Alternatively, the meaning of amanasikara is as follows. “A” stands for luminosity, and mental engagement (manasikara) is a word for self-blessing. In this way, the state of amanasikara means to bring forth the pure awareness that is the continuous flow of the nondual inseparable union of prajna and compassion, which has the character of self-blessing with or within inconceivable luminosity.715In other words, Maitripa s key notion of “mental nonengagement”—or “mental disengagement”—is just the subjective side of emptiness or what is called “freedom from reference points.” The only way in which the mind can engage in the “object” that is the absence of discursiveness is precisely by not engaging in or fueling any reference points, but rather letting it"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"172 Translators Introductionnaturally settle of its own accord. In other words, it is only by a nonrefer- ential mind that the absence of reference points can be realized, since that is the only cognitive mode that exactly corresponds to it. At the same time, when the mind rests in its own natural state, free from all discursiveness and reference points, this is not like a coma or being spaced out, but it is vivid and luminous intrinsic awareness.716Note that Maitrlpa’s two etymologies of “mental nonengagement” highlight the two crucial features of his Mahamudra approach that were explicitly spelled out by his student Sahajavajra and others later (see be­low). Maitrlpas linking mental nonengagement with the syllable “A” is an indication that his Mahamudra corresponds to prajnaparamita. For in the prajnaparamita sutras, the letter “A” stands for emptiness, or that “ev­erything is primordially unborn.”717 To connect mental nonengagement with the three highest levels of the completion stage of the Guhyasamaja- tantra (“self-blessing,” “luminosity,” and “union”) is a clear sign that this Mahamudra also entails vajrayana elements—not in terms of tantric rituals or techniques but in terms of inner experiences that represent the essence of the former and can be cultivated in Maitripa s sutra-based approach with the help of the pith instructions of a guru.718As Mathes (2008b, 20-21) points out, the translation of the Ama- nasikdradhara in a collection of Drikung Kagyii works719 is followed by an anonymous supplementary explanation of the meaning of “mental nonen­gagement.” Manasikara means mind as such appearing as all kinds of phe­nomena, while a refers to nonarising. Thus, amanasikara refers to these two being of the same nature. Its synonyms are utter nonabiding, nonconcep­tuality, and inconceivability. Mental nonengagement does not refer to the lack of any object, the lack of any cognition, the stopping of discrimination, a weak experience, or analysis through discriminating prajna. Therefore, it means realization through experiencing the heart of the matter.Furthermore Maitrlpas Sekanirdesa 29 says that Mahamudra is com­plete nonabiding in anything and is also self-awareness:Not to abide in anything Is known as “Mahamudra.”Since it is stainless and since it is self-awareness,Manifold [appearances] and so on do not arise.The Sekanirdesapanjika by Ramapala, one of the four principal students of Maitripa, comments that this verse teaches Mahamudra, which has"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 173the nature of the mind that is single as the essence of connateness.720 “In anything” refers to the dependently originating skandhas, dhàtus, àyatanas, and so on. “Not to abide” means mental nonengagement and lack of superimpositions. This is followed by the same two sütra quotes on mental nonengagement as in Maitrîpa’s Caturmudrâniscaya above. One should not think that one is not able to make this a living experience because, due to the kindness of one’s guru, Mahâmudrâ, which has the characteristic of being endowed with all supreme aspects, can definitely be perceived directly. Mahâmudrâ does not have the nature of the four moments (of the four joys) “since it is stainless and since it is self-awareness.” Being stainless, the three stained moments of the manifold and so on do not occur in it. Therefore the three (impure) joys do not arise in it either.721 Ràmapâla also says that nonabiding refers to the inconceivable wisdom that does not arise from analysis but is effortless, occurring of its own accord. Thus, it is clear for Râmapâla here that the Mahâmudrâ practice of complete nonabiding and mental nonengagement is not only mentioned in the sütras but can be undertaken through the kindness of able gurus (that is, their pith instructions) without having to rely on the practice of the other three mudràs in a vajrayâna context of the path of means.Another Mahâmudrâ key term—“ordinary mind” (which is one of its synonyms and is found in a few dohâs by Saraha and some others)722— appears very frequently in the Dohanidhikosaparipürnagïtinàmanijatattva- prakâsatïkâ attributed to Maitripa as well as once in Bhitakarmas Mudrà- caturatïkâ.723 Thus, the term, which later became such a hallmark of Tibetan Kagyü Mahâmudrâ, appears to have been used by some in India much earlier.724As indicated in TOK above as well as in BA, GC, and other Tibetan sources discussed below, Sahajavajras Tattvadaéakatïkâ is a very important source text for what came to be called “sütra Mahâmudrâ.” It is one of the few Indian treatises that explicitly and systematically links prajnàpàramità with Mahâmudrâ and certain vajrayâna approaches. The following are some of the text’s crucial passages in that regard (a number of which are also quoted or referred to in BA725 and GC726). Sahajavajra begins by saying that the pith instructions of prajnàpàramità as presented by Maitripa ac­cord with the vajrayâna:Since this master [Maitripa] gives a summarized explanation of thepith instructions of prajnàpàramità that accord with the mantra sys­tem, through the very being of the nature of phenomena that bears the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"174 Translators Introductionname “prajñapáramita” ..., he first pays his respect to the very nature of the three kàyas.727In addition, these pith instructions, which represent the supreme form of Madhyamaka, are further adorned with the pith instructions of the guru:The pith instructions of prajñapáramita are the definite realization of Madhyamaka that is adorned with the pith instructions of the guru. This is the ultimate emptiness, the spontaneously present prajña en­dowed with all supreme aspects.728As will be seen below, for Sahajavajra, this approach is thus a sûtra-based form of Mahamudra that includes some tantric elements, for example, the crucial role of the guru in giving direct pointing-out instructions of the nature of the mind as lucid yet empty self-awareness and the ensuing med­itative approach of cultivating the direct perception of this awareness as it was pointed out, rather than following the analytical route of classical Madhyamaka that is based on inferential cognitions through reasoning.Sahajavajra comments on Tattvadašaka 5 as representing this supreme Madhyamaka approach of Maitripa in the sense of sutra Mahamudra, which is not only based on emptiness in accordance with Nàgàrjuna but entails the direct realization of this emptiness as naturally luminous self-awareness:Thus, phenomena are of one taste,Unhindered, and nonabiding.Through the meditative concentration of reality as it is,They are all luminosity.In due order, “of one taste” means to be single-flavored as suchness___“Unhindered” refers to the nature [of phenomena’s] being without superimpositions. “Nonabiding” means being unborn, since [phe­nomena] do not at all abide in the nature of [either] existence or nonexistence. “Luminosity,” due to being naturally free from stains, refers to self-awareness, since [that self-awareness] is very luminous. You may wonder, “How do you see phenomena as true reality, which has the essential character of suchness?” Therefore, [Maitripa] says, “through the meditative concentration of reality as it is.” The path that"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 175is endowed with the union of calm abiding and superior insight is the meditative concentration of reality as it is.729When connected with this explanation, Tattvadasaka 2 (which says that, without the words of the guru, even Madhyamaka is only middling) implies that supreme Madhyamaka in the sense of sütra-based Mahàmudrà must include the pointing-out instructions that enable one to have direct experi­ences of emptiness as luminous self-awareness through the path of uniting calm abiding and superior insight in a nontantric context, that is, without having to rely on empowerments or the techniques of the vajrayana. Such pith instructions are explicitly referred to as “(skillful) means” (upâya) by Sahajavajra, while the regular Madhyamaka approach through reasoning alone is middling since it entails only prajñá but not skillful means.730As Tattvadasaka 7cd makes clear, this principle of experiencing ev­erything as luminous-empty awareness also applies to all levels of insight or attainment on the path, be they actual or imaginary. Here, Sahaja­vajra explicitly refers to both this approach and the true reality it reveals as Mahàmudrà:Even the vain presumptuousness about being free from duality,In like manner, is luminosity.. . . [This is elucidated] through the following words [in Maitrlpas Sekanirdesa]:By not abiding on the side of the remedy And not being attached to true reality either,There is no wish for a result of anything whatsoever.Therefore, it is known as Mahàmudrà.731Here, “Mahàmudrà” refers to the pith instructions on the true reality ofMahàmudrà, that is, thoroughly knowing the true reality of entities___“Being free from duality” means being without duality. “Vain presump­tuousness about” [being free from duality] refers to the conceptions that analyze true reality. Even that is [nothing but] “luminosity,” since it lacks a nature and is naturally pure. Likewise, also the presumptu­ousness in terms of something to be accomplished and the means of accomplishment is to be realized as the nature of luminosity.732"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"176 Translator s IntroductionSahajavajra also clearly distinguishes this sutra-based approach adorned with pith instructions from the vajrayana and the regular páramitáyána. He declares that this approach is inferior to the former but superior to the latter:You may wonder, “But then, what difference is there compared to yo- gins holding the approach of secret mantra?” There are great differ­ences in terms of the aspects of what is accomplished and the means of accomplishment since the [yogins who use this approach here] have no connection with the four mudrás and since, due to lacking the taste of the great bliss of the pride of [being] the deity, it takes them a long time to complete perfect awakening through [just] the [mental] aspect of equanimity [described]. On the other hand, they differ from yogins holding the approach of the páramitás because they are very much su­perior by virtue of realizing the suchness of union—emptiness as in­vestigated through the pith instructions of a genuine guru. Therefore, those who do not engage in austerities with regard to this very [such­ness but] thoroughly understand the true reality of [everything’s] being of a single taste as emptiness are like [skillful] village people catching a snake. Though they play with that snake, they are not bitten by it. Some express this as “the wisdom of true reality, Mahamudra.” As it is said:To unite means and prajňá—This meditation is the supreme yoga.To unify with Mahamudra Is meditation, the victor explained.733In addition to quoting numerous authoritative Indian maháyána masters (mainly Nágárjuna; though not only his classic Madhyamaka works but also his praises),734 Sahajavajra also cites several sutras, particularly essential passages from the Samádhirájasutra and the Laňkávatárasútra, in an effort to link Maitrlpas Mahamudra teachings with the sutras as the words of the Buddha himself. In brief, through all of the features described here, Sahajavajra s commentary provides clear evidence against the claim held by some that the sútra-based approach of Mahamudra is just an invention of the Kagyiipas in Tibet.735"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 177As mentioned before, Maitrlpa is credited with rediscovering the then-lost Uttaratantra and Dharmadharmatavibhaga. However, apart from that, it is not clear how important his role in the transmission of the Uttaratantra and the other texts of Maitreya was. It is remarkable that Maitrlpa, as the re­ported retriever of the Uttaratantra, hardly ever quotes it in his own works, and there seems to be no significant discussion of the text either by him or in the available works of his students (except for Vajrapani s comments on what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 in his Guruparamparakramopadesa right below). Also, what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 in Maitrlpas texts and those of his major students, discussed below, is never explicidy identified in these texts as coming from the Uttaratantra, and the available Sanskrit editions of Maitrlpas works as well as the Tibetan renderings of this verse in all of these texts suggest rather that it is Abhisamaydlamkara V.21 that is quoted.736 Still, at least Maitrlpa and Vajrapani appear to explain this quote more in line with the context of Uttaratantra 1.154.As the contents of IM may indicate, Maitrlpas teachings on the Ut­taratantra might have been transmitted only orally at first, but it is clear that there exist no known works on the Uttaratantra by Maitrlpa, and the text is quoted only twice in the works in his “cycle of mental nonengage­ment”—in the Pancatathagatamudravivarana (II.61b) and in the Catur- mudraniscaya (1.154). Unfortunately, neither of these texts explains those quotes in any detail.737What corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 also appears in the Doha- kosapahjika, ascribed to Maitrlpa, in the context of explaining Dohakosa 20d “The nature of connateness is neither existent nor nonexistent.” The Dohakosapanjika says that “existent” here refers to any entities that are per­ceived by the sense consciousnesses or imagined by the mental conscious­ness.738 Connateness is not existent in that way because it is the true nature of this multitude of appearing entities, and one is not liberated through just conceiving this multitude as it appears. Since connateness thus is some­thing to be personally experienced, it is not nonexistent either. This is as taught in what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154. Following this quote, the Dohakosapanjika continues that it is due to seeking bliss that humans are born from the union of their parents. However, they do not realize what this bliss is because it is to be personally experienced, which is again the rea­son why this bliss is not nonexistent. For it is inexpressible by virtue of ones being fully absorbed in it. This is the entity called “the bliss in the presenceConnections between MaitripcTs Mahamudra and the Uttaratantra"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"178 Translators Introductionof death.” Thus, in effect, the Dohakosapañjiká declares that one will be liberated only if one directly realizes the nature of connateness, which is equated with connate ultimate bliss, to be neither existent nor nonexistent. By implication, it is thus this connate bliss from which nothing is to be removed and to which nothing is to be added—it simply needs to be per­sonally experienced in a nonconceptual and nondual manner as it really is.The noteworthy exception to the Uttaratantra s not being discussed in a significant manner in the texts of Maitrlpas students appears to be Vajra- pànis Guruparamparakramopadesa. This text introduces its comments on verses 1-3 of Maitrïpas Tattvaratnàvalï, which discuss the notion of “complete nonabiding,” by quoting what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154. Vajrapânis comments in a classical prajfiàpàramità or Madhyamaka fashion in the context of his explanation of the philosophical systems of the pàramitâyàna here suggest either that what he had in mind may rather have been the almost identical Abhisamayàlamkâra V.21 or that he sim­ply interprets Uttaratantra 1.154 in two different ways in the two contexts of ordinary Madhyamaka and Mahâmudrâ.739 As will be clear from Vajra- pànis two explanations below, in effect, he relates Mahâmudrâ to both prajfiàpàramità (since we saw above that “nonabiding” is understood as Mahâmudrâ by Maitripa and Ràmapâla) and the Uttaratantra.Based on this quote, Vajrapânis Madhyamaka section in his Gu­ruparamparakramopadesa740 states that one should not abide in any super­impositions of existence or any denials by claiming nonexistence and then continues to comment on this as follows:Since the experience of mind as such as all kinds [of appearance] origi­nates in dependence, it is unarisen. It is the lack of arising that appears as if arising—arising and the lack of arising are not different. Like­wise, if appearances are examined through reasoning, they are empty. Empty refers to not being established, and appearances are what cannot withstand examination through reasoning.... For example, a mirages appearing as water is empty of water—it is the very nonexistence of water that appears as water. The appearance as water and the nonex­istence of water are not different. Likewise, appearance lacks a nature of its own, and the lack of nature is appearance. An appearance and its emptiness in terms of lacking a nature of its own are not different.For example, if many [logs of] firewood are burned by a fire, they [all] are the same in having the nature of fire. Eventually, the firewood will be exhausted, and the fire itself will not remain [either]. Likewise,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 179after what appears as manifold [appearances] has been referred to as emptiness through reasoning, [appearances] are neither established as having the nature of entities, nor does emptiness itself remain either. Likewise, when what does not abide as duality is not established as dual­ity, the lack of duality is not established either. Therefore, it is in order to put an end to the clinging of others, to cut through superimposition and denial, or as an expedient meaning that [appearances] are called “empty,” “lacking arising,” and “nondual.” But these [attributions] do not abide as the definitive meaning or as what is assessed by the learned.. . . Being without clinging, without anything to be negated, and without anything to be affirmed, meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment are nondual and nonabiding. . . . Mental nonengagement without superimposition and denial and without clinging is medita­tion. Through the prajññpáramitá that is without superimposition and denial and without clinging, the [other] five páramitás . . . are pure of the three spheres. By virtue of that, the welfare of sentient beings is promoted—this is the view. . . . By virtue of all phenomena’s hav­ing the nature of not arising as any nature of their own, they do not abide as either existent or nonexistent. Therefore, not to abide in any superimpositions and denials in terms of existence and nonexistence is the knowledge of true reality. Illusion-like and completely nonabiding compassion is nonreferential compassion . . . because it mentally en­gages in all phenomena as not being observable as anything whatsoever.Thus, according to Vajrapáni, all appearances are not only nothing other than emptiness, but emptiness is not something that can be reified or that remains after everything has been seen to be empty either. Therefore, ulti­mately, appearances as well as emptiness do not even abide as emptiness. Consequently, the knowledge of true reality must be the one that is free from superimposing and denying anything in terms of existence and non­existence. This indeed corresponds to RGVV s comments on Uttaratantra1.154-55 saying that “these two verses elucidate the unmistaken defining characteristic of emptiness [in the case of the tathágata heart] since it [thus] is free from the extremes of superimposition and denial.”When Vajrapáni later explains Mahamudra,741 he again uses the terms found in what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 and also repeats some similar ways of explanation. However, in this context of Mahamudra, he relates all this much more to the subject side of true reality—the noncon- ceptual and nondual wisdom of Mahamudra as the experience of the union"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"i8o Translators Introductionof minds luminosity and emptiness—as opposed to the object side that is mere emptiness. Thus, the presentation becomes more experiential and also more in tune with the meaning of Uttaratantra 1.154 in its own context. Speaking of instantaneous perfect awakening, Vajrapâni says that, when not realized, it is samsàra and when it is realized, the same is Mahâmudrâ, in which there is nothing to be negated or affirmed. Due to realizing it or not realizing it, it is expressed as nirvàna and samsàra, respectively, but ultimately there is no difference. For example, for as long as one does not realize that something is a rope, it may appear as a snake, but once one re­alizes it for what it is, it is clear that the nature of its appearing as a snake is nothing but the rope. There is no snake to be removed, nor is there any rope to be added. Likewise, if one does not realize Mahâmudrâ, it appears as all kinds of thoughts. When it is correctly realized, the very nature of all kinds of thoughts is a union with the nature of nonthought. It is nothing but nonthought (Mahâmudrâ) that appears as all kinds of thoughts. There is no thought to be removed here, nor is there any nonthought to be added.742Furthermore, Vajrapâni says that Mahâmudrâ s being presented as the three kàyas refers to the experiencing mind (which is something that later Kagyü masters very often say too). Mahâmudrâ mind s being unconditioned is the dharmakàya. That is, the dharmakàya is the mind that is not impaired by any thoughts and thus lacks any superimpositions and denials such as “existence,” “nonexistence,” “duality,” and “nonduality.’ The realization of this Mahâmudrâ mind is the sambhogakàya. That is, the sambhogakàya is the experience of great bliss through realizing the nature of nondual­ity. The nirmànakàya means that this very Mahâmudrâ mind appears as all kinds of appearances while not moving away from its own nature. The natural undifferentiated state of Mahâmudrâ mind is the svàbhàvikakâya— though it may be divided into the above three as a mere convention, the knowledge of true reality has no divisions but is of a single nature.The term “union” refers to the nonduality of luminosity and emptiness. Though the true nature is undifferentiable, it is designated as these two through dharma terminology. Its lack of entity when examined through reasoning refers to its being empty, while its being experienced as equality refers to its being luminous. Its being luminous is nothing other than its being empty, and its being empty is nothing other than its being luminous. For example, though a mirage may appear as water, there is actually no entity of water. Likewise, if luminosity is analyzed, it is empty in that it is without nature, but it is not empty in the sense of being absolutely nonex­istent like the horns of a rabbit. The emptiness of being without nature is"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 181the experience of luminosity, whereas the appearance of being established through reasoning as an existing entity is not. Therefore, since being lumi­nous and being empty are not different, they are a nonduai union. How­ever, just as before, it is for the sake of putting an end to others clinging to dualistic appearance that this is expressed as “union” and nonduality.” Actually, union and nonduality are not established in terms of their own specific characteristics and thus do not abide either.As for this being effortless, a cairn may appear as a person when not real­ized for what it is but clearly is a cairn when it is realized as such. However, there is no person to be removed nor is there a cairn to be established. Like­wise, when the ultimate essence—the nature of nonduality—is not realized, it appears as duality, but as soon as it is realized, it is nondual wisdom. Such realization is the view, while meditation means to settle the mind with­out distraction in all situations from the time of that realization onward. Here, Vajrapani also mentions the typical Mahamudra instruction that in Mahamudra meditation there is no need for blocking ones senses from their objects. Rather, whatever may appear is to be realized as the nature of Mahàmudrà. It is an inferior approach to examine whatever thoughts may arise with reasoning and “make” them lack a nature. Everything that appears as all kinds of things is mind as such, and once that mind is re­alized without any clinging, one meditates by realizing whatever arises as Mahàmudrà. fust like letting water settle on its own without muddying it, through which it becomes clear, Mahàmudrà meditation is to settle in an uncontrived manner through knowing the nature of all phenomena. This Mahàmudrà is the fruition of being free from stains (thoughts of negating, affirming, and so on), which is the connate joy free from any characteristics.In brief, Mahàmudrà is here described by Vajrapàni as the nonconcep- tual nondual wisdom nature of the mind, which seems to appear as all sorts of unreal thoughts (like a ropes being mistaken for a snake) until it is realized for what it is. This wisdom mind is the union of emptiness and luminosity, which is not an utter nonexistence after its illusory stains have disappeared but is the incontrovertible experience of its own natural state of lucid yet completely nonreferential awareness, just as the rope does not disappear into nothing when one sees that it is not a snake.Now we can return to the verse cited at the beginning of Vajrapànis Madhyamaka presentation above:There is nothing to be removed from thisAnd not the slightest to be added."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"i82 Translators IntroductionActual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.With the two elements of nonconceptual wisdom and thoughts here in the context of Mahamudra in mind, the quotation of this verse appears to be in line with the meaning it has in the Uttaratantra in conjunction with1.155—just as a rope is empty of an imaginary snake, the tathágata heart is empty of adventitious stains, or in other words, the Mahamudra mind of nonthought is empty of fictitious thoughts. Thus, adventitious thoughts are not to be removed and luminous-empty awareness is not to be added, but liberation simply means to see this true reality of Mahamudra as it is.What corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 is also quoted in three other texts by Maitrlpas main students. Rámapálas Sekanir dešap aňjiká cites the verse in a similar context as does Vajrapáni, saying that cognition and what is cognized are superimpositions and thus empty.743 So even within thoughts, in essence, thoughts are nothing other than nonthought. This applies to not knowing all appearances as true reality as well as to know­ing true reality. However, there is a difference in that the previous mind of clinging to the duality of apprehender and apprehended does not exist anymore later. Thus, ignorance consists of clinging to apprehender and apprehended. Rámapálas text also quotes Uttaratantra II.61b in the context of a very brief description of the four káyas.744Bhitakarmas Mudracaturatlka cites and explains what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 in order to ascertain that the undifferentiable connate nature is the ultimate dharmamudrá.745 His explanation exhibits a pra- jňápáramitá or Madhyamaka stance and thus is definitely more in line with the context of Abhisamayálamkára V.21. In this verse, he says, “in this” refers to the dharmamudrá. As for “removing,” appearances are the dhar- makáya, the guru, the instructions, and books. Something nonexistent does not need to be removed, and if something exists, even if one tries to re­move it, it cannot be removed. Therefore, “there is nothing to be removed.” Hence, the scriptures say:Form lacks a nature of its own, and there is no seer either. There is no sound, nor is there a hearer. There is no smell, nor is there a smeller. There is no taste, nor is there a taster. There is nothing tangible, nor is there a toucher. There is no mind, nor is there anything to mind."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 183“To add” means “to meditate”—if there are two, it is reasonable for the one to meditate on the other, but since there are no two here, there is noth­ing to meditate. Therefore, the scriptures say:There is nothing to meditate, nor a meditator.There is no secret mantra, nor a deity.Mantra and deity perfectly abideAs the freedom from reference points and the nature.Hence, there is nothing to be observed or to be focused on. Thus, not to make arising appearances and unarisen mind into two is called “actual reality.” To see this in the manner of not seeing anything whatsoever is called “seeing as it really is.” To directly perceive it is “to see actual reality.” Immediately upon that, one is liberated in an instant. Therefore, the middle of rasana and lalana is the one that relinquishes wrongdoing, which is called “connate wisdom.”Sahajavajras Tattvadasakatika quotes what corresponds to Uttaratan­tra 1.154 in the context of commenting on Tattvadasaka 3cd, which speaks about mistakenness as the cause of attachment (these two together being understood as the equivalent for obscuration) and how to remove it:Attachment is born from mistakenness.Mistakenness refers to ones own superimpositions. Attachment is fixation. Mistakenness means what is superimposed as the nature of entities, such as existence or nonexistence. Through such [superim­positions], one fixates again and again, which here means attachment, aversion, and ignorance. “Based on what should this mistakenness be relinquished?” In order to [answer that question, Maitripa] says:And mistakenness is held to be without basis.The meaning of this is that since here even the slightest arising has been negated, [removing mistakenness] is not just like extracting a thorn. Rather, it means to fully understand the nature [of mistakenness] and this nature is again nothing but its being unarisen. As it is [indicated] through the following words of the Bhagavan:Manjusri, ignorance has the meaning of nonexistence."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"184 Translators Introduction[And:]There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Who sees actual reality is liberated.746In sum, it appears that the explicit association of the Uttaratantra with Mahamudra was not initiated by Maitrlpa or his students except for Vajrapani, who is the only one to establish a clear and detailed relationship between what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 (and in effect 1.155) and the view and meditation of Mahamudra. Thus, at present, the above passage in his Guruparamparakramopadesa seems to be the sole—and rather slim—Indian basis we know of that could have served as the explicit ground for Gampopa’s famous statement that the scriptural source of Kagyii Mahamudra is the Uttaratantra. However, Gampopas writings do not refer to the above passage by Vajrapani and thus it is not very likely that he had it in mind when he made his statement. Rather it appears to have been his own general opinion on the relationship between the essence of the Uttaratantra and Mahamudra, which was followed by many later Kagyii masters. Still, as CMW and some of the texts by Monlam Tsiiltrim indicate, there seem to have been other earlier Indian and Tibetan Mahamudra instructions based on the Uttaratantra, but it is not clear whether Gampopa had access to them.Other Indian Nontantric Treatises on MahamudraThere are at least two other Indian nontantric canonical Buddhist texts that also equate prajnaparamita with Mahamudra. In his Tattvavatara, Jnanaklrti (eighth/ninth century) says:As for those of highest capacities among the persons who exert them­selves in the paramitas, when they perform the meditations of calm abiding and superior insight, even at the stage of ordinary beings, this grants them the true realization characterized by having its origin in Mahamudra. Thus, this is the sign of irreversible [realization].747And:"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 185All these results are accomplished through the meditation of the non­dual training in Mahâmudrâ. As the prajnàpàramità sütras extensively say:Those who wish to train in the bhümis of sràvakas should listen to just this prajnàpàramità . . . and should practice the yoga of just this prajiïàpàramitâ.The same is said there for [those who wish to train] “in the bhümis of pratyekabuddhas” and “in the bhümis of buddhas.” Another name of Mother Prajnàpàramità is Mahâmudrâ because it is the very nature of nondual wisdom. This is also the Bhagavàn, whose essential character is the dharmakàya. Exactly this is bodhicitta, the vajra of bodhicitta, the very nature of the Tathàgata. The wisdom of prajnàpàramità is nondual, and this actuality is what is to be accomplished by the tathâga- tas. It is also the nondual training in Mahâmudrâ because it has the character of great compassion.748In answer to the question what the nondual training in Mahâmudrâ is, Jnànakîrti quotes the same verse as Sahajavajra does above when he ex­plains Maitrlpa s sütra-based approach of Mahâmudrâ to be superior to the regular pàramitàyàna:To unite means and prajnà—This meditation is the supreme yoga.To unify with Mahâmudrâ Is meditation, the victor explained.Thus, the cultivation of means and prajnà is the cultivation of the non­dual training in Mahâmudrâ.749Jnànakîrti continues by explaining the meanings of means and prajnà, their union, and how the cultivation of this union represents Mahâmudrâ meditation in great detail, which is a very interesting account of a sütra- based Mahâmudrâ approach that directly employs compassion as one of its key elements and moreover involves some typically tantric techniques. The following is a summary:750 He states that prajnà is the realization of all phenomena as being free from reference points. This freedom from refer­ence points represents the emptiness that, in itself, is not just a term or yet"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"186 Translators Introductionanother reference point. The means in general consist of the three kinds of compassion of bodhisattvas—the compassion of focusing on suffering sen­tient beings, the compassion of focusing on them through understanding the dharma of impermanence, and nonreferential compassion. However, it is only the cultivation of the last type of compassion that represents the meditation that is the union of prajna and means because the other two lack being free from reference points since they still focus on entities. The way in which one gradually cultivates Mahamudra through this union of prajna and means entails three steps—one begins with becoming of the na­ture of all entities, then cultivates nonreferential compassion, and this then eventually turns into the meditation that has the character of Mahamudra.The pith instructions on how to do so are as follows: One first visualizes oneself as ones personal yidam deity in an instantaneous manner. Then, one meditates on oneself being of the nature of all entities through think­ing that one has the nature of Vairocana, who represents the essence of ignorance, and therefore one has the nature of the skandha of form that pervades all beings. Likewise, since one has the natures of Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, and Aksobhya, who represent the essences of pride, desire, envy, and hatred, respectively, one has the natures of the skandhas of feelings, discriminations, formations, and consciousness that pervade all beings. Through having thus become of the nature of all enti­ties, one manifests the great kinds of compassion of focusing on suffering sentient beings and focusing on them through the dharma. Then, through letting go of any kind of mental engagement in entities, nonentities, self-entity, other-entity,751 and so on, one needs to withdraw the mind from everything and not think about anything. In that way, in yogins who do not think about anything whatsoever and have relied on a guru for a long time before, prajnaparamita will arise by virtue of the kindness of that guru. Due to having completely turned away from the distinction between assessing through valid cognition and the result to be assessed, this has the nature of self-appearance. By virtue of being free from all reference points, one is free from samsara, which has the nature of suffering and reference points. Therefore, this is realized through the mirrorlike yoga that has the charac­ter of supreme joy. Once one, through the power of that, thinks “Alas, all these sentient beings have the nature of nirvana, but through the power of ignorance, they do not recognize this—how can I make them realize it?” and thus thinks of all beings as having that nature, this will give rise to nonreferential compassion. Thus, one needs to think of their having this nature—the nature of all entities. Then, once this yoga that has the nature"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 187of all entities and has the character of great compassion has become pow­erful, the very character of this great compassion that has the nature of all entities takes on a character that is not different from the nature of mother prajnaparamita, another name of which is Mahamudra, just as water and milk blend into one. This is then what one should look at. At that time, through familiarization, it becomes very clear. It also has the nature of all merit because it is the vajra nature of bodhicitta, which is the sovereign of the vajras of body, speech, and mind of all tathagatas, because that vajra has the nature of prajna and means being nondual. One also realizes that externally oriented cognitions are merely superimpositions but not ones own true nature. Therefore, it is well known that this yoga of prajna and means being nondual is self-aware direct valid cognition and not just a su­perimposition. How could this yoga that is the fundamental change, has the nature of the nondual wisdom of Mahamudra free from reference points, and is well known as self-awareness have any kind of superimposition of reference points?Though some technical details vary, this description of a Mahamudra approach that, through the kindness of the guru, strips away all obscuring mental activities and reveals the direct perception of minds innate lumi­nous self-awareness accords in its general features with Sahajavajras above explanations.Later,752 in his section on the stages of the meditation of superior in­sight, Jnanaklrti quotes and comments on the famous two verses X.256-57 from the Lahkavatdrasutra on the “four yogic practices” (prayoga)753 used in many mahayana texts:By relying on mere mind,One does not imagine outer objects.By resting in the observed object of suchness,One should go beyond mere mind too.Going beyond mere mind,One must even go beyond nonappearance.The yogin who rests in nonappearanceSees the mahayana.Jnanaklrti explains the first verse in a rather standard way by matching it with the first three of the four yogic practices: (1) outer objects are observed to be nothing but mind, (2) thus, outer objects are not observed,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"i88 Translators Introductionand (3) with outer objects being unobservable, a mind cognizing them is not observed either. On X.257 (corresponding to (4) not observing both apprehender and apprehended, nonduality or suchness is observed), he comments that since suchness is unborn, it neither exists as an entity nor exists as the lack of entity. This means that suchness is the complete lack of reference points, since entities and the lack of entity include all possible reference points. Through realizing that, all beings are understood as having the nature of the dharmakàya, thus going beyond the understanding of mere mind. The yogin must even transcend the state of true reality’s not appearing in the manner of being a unity or a multiplicity and the like. To fully rest in the nonappearance of any reference points whatsoever is to realize true reality, here called “the mahâyàna,” and another form of that name is “Mahâmudrâ.” Thus, Jnànakîrti indicates that the final realization of the freedom from reference points even in the mahâyàna of the sütras is nothing but Mahâmudrâ, which he further equates with the famous “nonseeing is the supreme seeing” in the prajnàpàramità sütras:What is the eye of wisdom of the Buddha, the Bhagavàn? Not seeing anything through anything. . .. Likewise, what is seeing the ultimate? The nonseeing of all phenomena.Jnànakîrti also clarifies here that such nonseeing is, of course, not just the same sheer absence of any mental engagement as when one is asleep or ones eyes are closed.Implicitly, the Prajnàjnànaprakàsa by Devacandra,754 another one of the four main students of Maitripa, also equates Mahâmudrâ with pra­jnàpàramità since it says that Mahâmudrâ has the characteristic of the realization of the lack of nature, which is uncontrived. Merely through contrived prajnà and wisdom, the omniscient wisdom of suchness, which has the nature of continuous great bliss, will never arise.As for the equation of Mahâmudrâ with prajnàpàramità, it is quite com­mon in tantric Buddhist texts. For example, Kâlacakramahàpàdas Pad- maninâmapanjikây a commentary on the Kâlacakratantra, presents the definition of Mahâmudrâ as follows:“Mahâmudrâ [the Great Seal]” is the prajnàpàramità that gives birth to all tathàgatas appearing in the past, future, and present. Since it seals the nonabiding nirvána or changeless bliss, it is “the seal.” Since it is"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 189superior to karmamudra and jñánamudrá and is free from the latenttendencies of samsara, it is “great.”755Furthermore, Vajrapánis Laghutantratika on the Cakrasamvaratantra equates Mahamudra with prajñápáramitá and “being endowed with the su­preme of all aspects.”756As for the question of Atisa’s connection with Mahamudra as mentioned above in TOK (and below by the Eighth Karmapa and Eighth Situpa), note that the introduction to Karma Trinlépas commentary on Sarahas three cycles of dohá says that Atisa was greatly involved in the dohá teachings and had received Sarahas dohá lineage from Maitrlpa.757 BA agrees and adds that Maitrlpa also taught Atisa the root text and commentary of the Uttaratantra,758 as well as other texts.759 Both Karma Trinlépa and BA say that Atisa had started to teach the dohás in Tibet but was discouraged by his students from continuing for fear of a deterioration of Tibetans’ en­gaging in conditioned virtues due to the style and contents of these dohás (which do not accord with the gradual path and the proper conduct that is emphasized in more conventional Buddhist teachings). BA says that Atisa’s primary student, Dromtonpa Gyalwé Jungné, did receive teachings on the dohás and vajrayána methods from him but pretended not to have received such for the same reason as above.760 The same text also quotes Milarepa as saying that Atisa was not allowed to teach vajrayána, but, if he had, Tibet would be filled with accomplished siddhas.761 In that context, it should also be noted that verses 64-66 of Atisas Bodhipathapradipa explicitly forbid monastics from receiving the second and third empowerments in the Yo- gánuttara class of tantra because that would break their monastic vows.It is clear that since the dohás mainly teach Mahamudra, any other po­tential Mahamudra instructions by Atiáa to a wider audience would seem to have been prevented for the same reason. It would certainly be very in­teresting to compare Mahamudra teachings by Atiáa as the founder of the Kadampa School with other Mahámudrá-like instructions in that tradition, such as the texts by Kyoton Monlam Tsiiltrim presented in this book. As suggested by the Eighth Karmapa above in TOK and others, certain parts of Atisas teachings in his Bodhipathapradipa and its autocommentary for individuals of highest capacity among the three types of individuals in the lamrim teachings (in particular, verses 54-58), though rather clearly ex­plained as referring to Madhyamaka, can also be read as being in agree­ment with Maitrlpa s approach of mental nonengagement since thoughts are repeatedly identified as the root of samsara and as something one needs"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"190 Translators Introductionto let go of. Most striking in this regard is an unidentified quote, attributed to Nâgârjuna, in Atisas autocommentary, which (as mentioned above) is also used by Padma Karpo in his explanation of the meaning of “mental nonengagement”:To the one who does not think through imagination,Whose mind does not abide at all,Who is without mindfulness, is without mental engagement,And is without focus, I pay homage.762Note also that Atisas Madhyamakopadesa says that once all phenomena have been found to be nonexistent through analysis, one needs to rest in luminous nonconceptuality without mental engagement.763 Interestingly, in terms of the teachings on buddha nature, his autocommentary on the Bodhipathapradipa says that all sentient beings have a single disposition, which is the tathagata heart,764 and he includes the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra, the Angulimdlïyasütra, and the Lankdvatdrasütra (which are certainly not typical Madhyamaka sources) in its list of sütras that are a must-read.765 Furthermore, the beginning of Atisas Dharmadhdtudarsanagiti speaks about the dharmadhatu as buddha nature in a highly affirmative manner by including eighteen verses from the Dharmadhdtustava and also using phrases found in the Uttaratantra, such as the dharmadhatu s being inseparable from the buddha qualities and its being enshrouded by afflictions corresponding to the example of a child in a pregnant womans womb.766In any case, that there actually were Mahàmudrà-style instructions in the Kadampa School within the context of the teachings for individuals of highest capacity in the lamrim approach is proven by such instructions’ being found in that very context in Mônlam Tsültrim’s Essential Pith In­structions That Summarize the Quintessence o f the Pitakas.767Gampopa’s Mahamudra and the UttaratantraBefore Gampopa (1079-1153) met Milarepa, he had already studied with a number of Kadampa teachers for several years, including Jayiilwa Shônnu Ô768 (1075-1138), Néusurpa Yeshé Bar769 (1042-1118), Nyugrumpa Dsôn- drü Gyaltsen,770 Gya Jagriwa,771 Gya Yônda,772 Jangchub Sempa Kunga,773 Shawa Lingpa,774 and Geshé Drepa.775 Pawo Rinpoche says that Gampopa received the following teachings from the following Kadampa teachers776— vinaya from Jayiilwa, lamrim from Nyugrumpa, all of Atisas pith instruc­tions from Jagriwa and Gya Yônda, and Milarepa’s pith instructions from"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 191Lama Jangchub Sempa.777 He also received Cakrasamvara teachings from Marylil Loden778 and Sangkar Lotsawa Pagpa Sherab.Thus, when Gampopa came to Milarepa, he was already an accomplished teacher in his own right, having excelled in both the study and practice of the Kadampa system, but it became obvious very quickly that he was in for a very different ride with Milarepa. According to BA,779 in order to curb Gampopas pride, Milarepa first had him wait for half a month before he granted him an audience. When he was finally admitted, Gampopa offered a piece of gold and a package of tea. Milarepa refused both and instead gave Gampopa a skull-cup with Tibetan beer, insisting that he drink it despite his obvious concerns about his monastic vows. When Gampopa requested Milarepa’s profound instructions, Milarepa asked whether he had received empowerments. Gampopa answered, “I received many empowerments of Cakrasamvara and others, listened to numerous Kadampa instructions, and have experienced resting in samadhi for thirteen days.” Milarepa laughed out loud and said, “The gods of the form and formless realms are more advanced than you then—they rest in samadhi for many eons. However, none of this is of any benefit for attaining buddhahood, just as pressing sand will not produce liquid butter. The Kadampas have instructions, but they lack pith instructions. Because a demon had entered the heart of Tibet, Atisa was not allowed to teach the mantrayana. If he had, Tibet would now be filled with siddhas. The Kadampa generation stage involves only single yidam deities,780 and their completion stage consists only of dissolving the surrounding and its contents into luminosity. Now, you need to cultivate my candall.” Following that, he conferred the empowerment of Vajravarahl upon Gampopa, who then practiced accordingly.Milarepa also said to Gampopa, “As for the aspect of calm abiding in your practice, however good all of this may be, it does not go beyond being a cause for rebirth in the higher realms of samadhi. As for the aspect of your practice of superior insight, all of it entails the danger of diverging into the four deviations from emptiness. It may well serve as a remedy for some portions of reification, such as clinging to real existence. However, since it is not able to cut through the entirety of clinging to extremes, there is the danger that the whole complex of this excellent view and meditation itself could turn into cognitive obscurations. Hence, if one is fettered, there is no difference between being fettered by an iron chain and being fettered by a golden chain.” Later, Gampopa said about this, “If I had not met the great master Milarepa, I would have risked rebirth as a long-lived god.” After having stayed in solitary meditation retreat for many years after he"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"192 Translators Introductionhad left Milarepa, Gampopa eventually combined the systematic and ana­lytical approach of the Kadampa teachings with the Kagyii instructions on Mahamudra, which led to him being called “the one who united the two streams of Kadampa and Mahamudra.”Among the thirty-eight preserved works of Gampopa, ten deal with Mahamudra as their exclusive subject. However, almost all of them are not his own writings but notes from his teachings taken by his students. This is obviously not the place to give an exhaustive survey of Gampopa’s Mahamudra teachings,781 so a few general main points shall suffice.In his texts, Gampopa distinguishes three main paths. (1) The paramitayana is called “the path of renunciation” and “the path of accu­mulation,” which relies on inferential analysis and is for those who have faith and are of dull faculties. (2) The path of mantra is labeled “the path of transformation” and “the path of means,” which relies on direct perception and is for those who are afflicted and of medium faculties. (3) The path of Mahamudra is “the path of prajna” and “the path of suchness,” which relies on blessing and is for those who are intelligent and of sharp faculties. He also describes these three paths as follows:(1) As for taking inference as the path, after having scrutinized all phe­nomena through arguments [such as] being beyond singularity and multiplicity, one says that there is no [other] possibility [for phenom­ena to be] than these [possibilities that one has examined] and then posits that everything is empty. [This is the path of] inference.(2) [The practice of] nadls, vayus, and tilakas,782 the repeated recita­tion of mantras, and so on, which are based on the generation stage of the deity’s body, make up the path of blessing.(3) As for taking direct perceptions as the path, a genuine guru says that connate mind as such is the luminous dharmakaya. Through hav­ing been taught an unmistaken instruction of definitive meaning like that, one then takes native mind as the path, without separating the triad of view, conduct, and meditation in terms of this connate mind about which one has gained certainty within oneself.783Elsewhere, Gampopa explicitly states that Mahamudra is the highest path that actually transcends both sutra and tantra. All of this clearly suggests that Gampopa considered Mahamudra per se as a path that does not belong to either sutra or tantra but lies beyond both. In practice, most of Gampo­pa s preserved teachings consist primarily of sutra-based instructions and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 193then conclude with Mahâmudrâ, either not teaching the path of mantra at all or mentioning it only in passing.Typical Mahâmudrâ instructions by Indian siddhas are often simply ex­pressions of the authors yogic realization or very short pith instructions to their most advanced disciples. Even when they mention some details on how to practice, these instructions are usually terse and unsystematic. By contrast, Gampopas Mahâmudrâ instructions are much longer and pro­vide systematic progressive guidance. As exemplified by the fifth section of his Pointing Out Thoughts as the Ultimate,784 such instructions often be­gin with preliminaries such as turning away from the mundane toward the spiritual path through the four reminders, giving rise to love, compassion, and bodhicitta, choosing a qualified guru, and cultivating calm abiding and superior insight. These preliminaries are followed by the actual instructions of pointing out the nature of the mind. Such pointing-out instructions are classified by Gampopa as being of five types—(1) pointing out appearances as mind through the analogy of sleep and dream, (2) pointing out the in­separability of appearance and emptiness through the analogy of water and ice, (3) pointing out mind as such as empty through the analogy of the empty sky, (4) pointing out multiplicity as being of one taste through the analogy of the taste of a piece of sugar, and (5) pointing out the continu­ity of the dharmakàya through the analogy of the continuity of a river.785 Gampopa s works also explain the stages of experiences that are commonly known as the four yogas of Mahâmudrâ (see below).As with his Indian predecessors, the actual core Mahâmudrâ instruc­tion—the pointing-out instruction—in Gampopas teachings is short, but it may appear lengthy due to being augmented by the discussions of the preliminaries and the four yogas. The Mahâmudrâ instructions by Gam­popa employ the same terms that are found in the Mahâmudrâ teachings of Indian siddhas such Saraha, Tilopa, and Maitripa, and it is clear that Gampopa used their texts as sources for his Mahâmudrâ since he said to Pamo Trupa that the Indian Mahâmudrâ texts include the dohàs, “the seven works on accomplishment,” “the sixfold cycle of the essence,”786 and “the cycle of works on mental nonengagement.”787 However, in his partic­ular Mahâmudrâ approach, Gampopa almost always omits the tantric path of means that is an integral part in many of the instructions of his prede­cessors.788 In that vein, though the word “bliss” occurs in his Mahâmudrâ instructions, it does not have the significance of this term in the tantras (the wisdom of great bliss as pointed out during the third and fourth em­powerments). Rather, Gampopa uses it to refer to the bliss of experiences"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"194 Translators Introductionresulting from calm abiding. Thus, his approach to Mahamudra (which later was called “sutra Mahamudra”) can be seen as a synthesis of mainstream mahayana teachings with what later was called “essence Mahamudra,” while skipping “tantra Mahamudra.”Such an approach represents both a skillful means to make Mahamudra accessible to a wider audience and clear evidence for the Kadampa influ­ences in Gampopa s teachings. At the same time, Gampopa considered gen­uine Mahamudra as the highest path that transcends both sutra and tantra. As pointed out by Sherpa (2004, 132-33), Gampopas approach of making Mahamudra accessible to students of all kinds of capacities without pre­requisites such as empowerments seems to involve a contradiction between his statement that the realization of Mahamudra (the highest achievement in vajrayana Buddhism) is an insight achieved by only a few and the claim that the Mahamudra teachings can be practiced by general audiences. Ob­viously, the term “Mahamudra” is used here in two distinct senses. The former refers to the original sense of this term as being the realization of minds true nature, which in its essence is superior to both the sutric and tantric paths. In its second sense, the term refers to a progressive peda­gogical system (largely based on Maitrlpas approach) that includes many conventional mahayana teachings and a few elements from the approach of the Indian siddhas and the vajrayana (such as pointing-out instructions, guru devotion, and guru yoga), while only eventually culminating in the first kind of Mahamudra.Despite hardly discussing the vajrayana path of means in his texts, it is clear that Gampopa did teach the techniques of this path to those students who were able to understand and practice them. Thus, his instructions were completely geared to whichever audiences he encountered. Also, though he explicitly says that he favors the gradualist approach, he also accounts for and uses the possibility of instantaneous insights.To provide a typical example of Gampopas writings, lets look at some major points in his Pointing Out Thoughts as the Ultimate. The structure of this text is the clearest example of Gampopas union of Kadampa and Kagyii teachings because, in its first, second, and fifth sections, the presen­tations of the Kadampa positions on certain issues are regularly followed by explanations of Milarepas viewpoints. As for the contents, section 1, “Pointing Out Thoughts as the Ultimate,” says that the nature of the mind is sometimes called “ordinary mind” and sometimes “natural state” but these mean the same. Speaking of minds “nature” means that it is not a nonexistent (ibid., 202-3). According to Milarepa, thoughts are very kind."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 195The way in which they are kind is that they arise from the mind, and this mind is the dharmakaya. Thoughts represent the realization of minds na­ture. Such realization is like a lamp in that it illuminates this nature and it resembles a weapon in that it cuts the root. Thus, through taking thoughts as the path, nonconceptual wisdom dawns (ibid., 212-13). Section 2, “In­structions on the Union of Generation and Completion, “says that the statement “connate mind as such is the dharmakaya” means that awareness and emptiness are connate (ibid., 234-35).Section 3, “A Summary of the Stages of the Path,” contains a description of the four yogas of Mahamudra. (1) Gampopa says that you familiarize with the natural state of mind as such by settling the mind in an uncon­trived manner, just as water settles in water. Through settling the mind in three ways—freshly, loosely, and naturally—you will be able to hold the mind a little bit and also catch a glimpse of its nature. Mind will be vibrant, crisp, and one-pointed. Even after your sessions, such states will occur in bits. Because you have recognized a part of your own basic awareness, you will be joyful and inspired. This is called “the yoga of one-pointedness.”(2) Just as a great river is uninterrupted in its flow or the tip of a can­dle flame has no interruption in its luminosity, you will experience such a continual stream of basic awareness through being mindful day and night and meditating again and again. Then, you will realize that both outer ap­prehended objects and the inner apprehending mind are free from the four extremes of reference points. You see your own basic awareness as clearly as if a fresh fruit were placed onto your palm. Sometimes good experiences and sometimes bad ones will arise. This is called “the yoga of the freedom from reference points.”(3) Then, when you have meditated in that way, as far as your medita­tive experience goes, the triad of outer appearances, your own body, and your mind will appear without any difference, just like water and milks being mixed in an indistinguishable manner. Even in your realization (versus mere experience), these three kinds of phenomena will appear without any dif­ference. At that time, you will even see whether other people possess or lack true meditation. This is called “the yoga of multiplicity’s being of one taste.”(4) Next, due to having meditated in such a way, you resolve that all phe­nomena are equality. Through that, it will occur to you that there is nothing to be relinquished, no remedy to be relied upon, no awakening to be accom­plished, no samsara to be abandoned, nothing to meditate on nor a medita­tor. This is called “the yoga of nonmeditation.” However, this is not yet fully qualified buddhahood. As long as this body that is a karmic maturation still"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"196 Translators Introductionexists, there will be pleasant and painful feelings. For example, though a lion cub has completed its prowess in its mothers womb, it is not able to display this prowess until it has come out of the womb’s enclosure. Likewise, though a garuda chick’s wings are fully grown inside its egg, being constrained by this shell, it cannot fly until the eggshell is broken. Thus, buddhahood oc­curs in the intermediate state of dying (ibid., 270-71).Section 4, “The Concordances and Differences between the Philosophi­cal Systems of Sütra and Mantra,” says that the view of the vajrayâna is in accordance with Madhyamaka as far as the empty nature of phenomena is concerned, but it is more special by virtue of bliss—it appears as empty bliss. In terms of self-aware, self-lucidity, it accords with Yogàcàra. How­ever, it is not just mere lucidity but appears as blissful taste. Therefore, lu­cidity appears as emptiness and emptiness appears as lucidity—their union is the secret mantra. It is only in terms of each one of these elements that the view of the mantrayàna partially accords with Madhyamaka and Yo­gàcàra (ibid., 260-61). As for familiarizing with this, there is no one who meditates—since self-awareness is free from all identifications, no exam­ples or words can illustrate it. From the perspective of characteristics, even the buddhas of the three times do not see it. Within its essence, there is no object on which to meditate either. In this way, since there is nothing to experience, there is not even the slightest something to meditate on. Thus, Gampopa says, “I do not assert lucidity. To assert lucidity means to identify it. Nor do I assert bliss or nonconceptuality. Bliss and nonconceptuality are also identifications. No example can illustrate me. No word can describe me. Do not fabricate me but simply let be!” (ibid., 270-71).Section 5, “The Heart of the Stages of the Path,” begins with the prelim­inaries such as the four reminders mentioned above and then comes to the actual Mahâmudrâ instructions, saying that ultimate bodhicitta arises from the blessings of the guru and the experiences in one’s own meditation. As Milarepa says:Phenomenal existence is included in the mind.Mind dwells within the state of lucidity.In this, there is nothing to be identified.789Gampopa also quotes the siddha Kotàli:Ordinary mind awakens in the middle of your heartOnce the six collections are pure, bliss is a continual flow."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 197All actions are pointless, being the cause of suffering.Rest in the natural state in which there is nothing to meditate.790Gampopa continues that one needs to practice by means of the completion stage of elaborated and unelaborated Mahamudra and so on. In terms of elaborate Mahamudra, one practices by means of nadl and vayu or special methods. The seeing of the ultimate essence of the mind arises initially for just an instant. Just as the waxing moon on its first day has the capacity of becoming the full moon, starting with a single moment, this ultimate essence will eventually pervade walking, standing, lying, and sitting at all times. Some geshes say, “Now in this lifetime is not the time for this essence to arise.” But Milarepa said, “If now is not the time for the essence to arise, when is that time? If it does not arise at this time when you have obtained the freedoms and riches of an excellent human body, when your five sense faculties are not defective, and when you have met a mahayana guru, do you think it arises when you have been born in the three lower realms? No way!” (Sherpa 2004,286-93).Gampopas Pith Instructions on the Two Armors (a collection of dif­ferent short instructions) speaks about taking connate union as the path through the two armors of the view and prajna, taking thoughts as the path, thoughts appearing as the four kayas, and so on.791 Interestingly, the text also contains pith instructions by Gampopa’s Kadampa teacher Jagriwa:These are Lama Jagriwas pith instructions, called “trouncing upon encountering,” “pursuing subsequently,” and “proliferating out of nothing.” When great meditators meditate, they trounce occurring thoughts right upon encountering them—they cut through thoughts as being without arising immediately upon their occurring. As for “pur­suing subsequently,” thoughts [arise] and then one looks from where they arose at first. Through that, one understands that they arose from the mind and also dissolve into the mind at the end. [Thoughts] are not dual with and not different from mind. He said that this is called “pur­suing subsequently.” As for “proliferating out of nothing,” through thinking something heavy in ones mind, something unpleasant will manifest. These are thoughts, while minds being without arising is the dharmakaya, he said. The three examples [for this] are that it is similar to a fires spreading in a forest [from a small spark to a wildfire]. [It is similar to] how wind and so on become its aids—likewise, whichever thoughts arise, they become the aids of prajna, he said. It is similar to"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"198 Translators Introductionsnows falling into water—all the snow that falls into water becomes of one taste with it. Likewise, immediately upon the arising of thoughts, they are of one taste with the connate. It is taught that this is Geshé Jagriwas approach of taking [thoughts as the path].792Obviously, these instructions on three ways to deal with thoughts ac­cording to ones capacity are very similar to Mahamudra teachings, and the examples are also used in the Mahamudra tradition. In line with the texts by Monlarn Tsiiltrim, these instructions are further evidence that Mahámudrá- style teachings existed in the Kadampa School, that this was the case even before Gampopa, and that Gampopa received such instructions.Gampopa s text also explains the four yogas of Mahamudra.793 To rest in the essence of basic awareness without being distracted is the yoga of one-pointedness.794 If thoughts arise in that one-pointedness, trounce them upon encountering them or pursue them subsequently. Through taking thoughts as the path in that way, they become indispensable and of great kindness. This is the yoga of the freedom from reference points. Remaining undistracted in that, when outer appearances become indistinct, this is the yoga of multiplicitys becoming of one taste. Through familiarizing with that, basic awareness becomes absolutely naked.795 At that point, through the perfection of being familiar with it, the dharmakaya is attained. This is the yoga of nonmeditation. Through this, the armor of prajñá is taught by way of the armor of the view.Furthermore, Gampopa says that the difference between the pára- mitáyána and the mantrayána lies in their being long and short paths, respectively.796 Also, in Náropas system, there is something to meditate, while in Maitrlpas system there is nothing to meditate. At the time of the path, there is something to meditate, but at the time of the fruition, there is nothing to calculate in terms of meditating or not meditating. In the mantrayána, there is no path to be calculated—all there is is realizing or not realizing true reality. However, those of the highest faculties rely on neither the páramitáyána nor the mantrayána.The text states that connate wisdom is this presently existing ordinary mind.797 In order to recognize it, based on the words of the guru, let this ordinary mind be in an uncontrived manner. Let it be unaffected. Let it be in its own place. Let it be natural as it pleases. Through letting it be in this way, your own mind is realized as being without arising, abiding, and ceas­ing and as not being any entity."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 199Gampopa s preserved works do not feature any obvious references to the Uttaratantra, which is remarkable given the famous statement attributed to him that “the text for this Mahâmudrâ of ours is this Mahâyànottaratan- trasâstra composed by the Bhagavân Maitreya.” However, this statement is not preserved in Gampopas available texts. He must have studied the Uttaratantra with his Kadampa teachers, but there is no evidence that he had direct contact with Dsen Kawoché or one of his students. BA says that Gampopa produced an understanding of Mahâmudrâ in beginners who had not obtained empowerment, which is the system of prajnàpàramità.798 Since Gampopa had said to Pamo Trupa that the Uttaratantra is the basis for his Mahâmudrâ, Pamo Trupa transmitted this text to Jigden Surngon. This is the reason why many explanations of the Uttaratantra are found in the writings of Jigden Surngon and his students (see below).In any case, the statement on the Uttar at antra's being the basis of Mahâmudrâ and the existence of early corresponding instructions in texts such as CMW and those by Kyoton Monlarn Tsiiltrim are evidence that such teachings must have existed earlier in India and Tibet (at least from the tenth century onward). It is also noteworthy that the transmission of the works of Monlarn Tsiiltrim (the eighth abbot of the great Kadampa seat Nartang) shows that these teachings were part of the Kadampa tradi­tion, which at that time clearly represented mainstream Tibetan Buddhism. As mentioned above, many early Kagyü lineage holders, such as Gampopa and the First and Third Karmapas, studied extensively in the Kadampa tradition.799 Whether they received teachings of the kind as contained in Monlarn Tsültrims texts during their studies is not known, but it is very likely (which would also explain Gampopa s reported statement on the Ut­taratantra). Of course, it is equally possible that those Kagyü masters ob­tained such teachings from other sources. Still, as many Kagyü works on Mahâmudrâ say, sütra Mahâmudrâ comes from the Uttaratantra, Maitripa, 01* the Kadampas. All of this is clearly confirmed by the existence of texts such as those by Monlarn Tsiiltrim within the Kadampa tradition itself.GC says that the Mahâmudrâ approach of Gampopa based on the Ut­taratantra is followed by those who correctly understand the pith instruc­tions of the three masters from Kham800 and others.801 In that regard, GC quotes the early Drugpa Kagyü master Gôtsangpa Gônpo Dorje802 (1189— 1258) as having said that the one who excelled in Mahâmudrâ among the teachings of the Buddha was Saraha, followed by Savaripa and Mai- tripa (which, GC says, is very clear from Maitrlpas Tattvadasaka and its commentary by Sahajavajra), while in Tibet it was due to the kindness of"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"200 Translators IntroductionGampopa that the Mahamudra tradition was transmitted even to cowherds. Both GC and BA803 state that Mahamudra is explained in Sahajavajras Tat- tvadasakatika as the wisdom of suchness that has the three characteris­tics of its natures being paramita, its being in accordance with the secret mantra, and its names being “Mahamudra.” Therefore, the Mahamudra of prajnaparamita of lord Gampopa was described by Gotsangpa as being a teaching of Maitrlpa. At the same time, Gampopa also transmitted the Mahamudra that belongs to the path of tantra to his inner disciples.GC continues that Vajrapani, another main student of Maitrlpa, also ex­plained this Mahamudra of prajnaparamita to many learned ones in Tibet. Padampa Sangye, a direct disciple of Maitrlpa, gave the name The Pacifi­cation o f Suffering to the Mahamudra whose essence is prajnaparamita and that accords with secret mantra, teaching it to countless students in Tibet. Likewise, the pith instructions and textual explanations coming down from Dsen Kawoche are definitely in accordance with Maitrlpa. Thus, in effect, GC says that the teachings that came to be known as Shentong accord with Mahamudra.In that vein, GCs comments on Uttaratantra 1.52-63 say that, through­out birth, sickness, aging, and death, the skandhas and so on arise, abide, and cease within the basic expanse of nonconceptuality, which is not af­fected by the fires of sickness, aging, and death.804 When one dies, one sim­ply dissolves back into the expanse of nonconceptuality. When one is sick and ages, it is that expanse itself that appears in the form of the pains of sickness and the process of aging. With this in mind, Padampa Sangye as­serted that everybody, be they male, female, old, young, or lepers, is able to see true reality if they possess the skillful means of a guru. Also the follow­ers of the tradition of Dsen Kawoche hold that these situations of sickness and so on can be made into the path through pith instructions (as men­tioned above, Dsen originally requested teachings on the Uttaratantra from Sajjana as his instructions to be practiced at the time of death).Interestingly, BA805 connects Gampopas Mahamudra realization with a passage from the introduction of the Dharanisvarardjasutra that is also quoted in RGVV as the source of the first three vajra points.806 BA says that, just as this introduction states that “the Bhagavan has completely and per­fectly awakened to the equality of all phenomena,” Gampopas own reali­zation of Mahamudra was supreme. Just as this sutra says “has excellently turned the wheel of dharma,” Gampopa uninterruptedly turned the wheel of vast instructions day and night. Just as this sutra states “is endowed with the assemblies of limitless very disciplined disciples,” Gampopa had"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 201inconceivably many students who were endowed with the twelve quali­ties of abstinence,807 had devotion for their guru, were not attached to this world, and made practicing meditation in solitary places the main thing in their lives.BA continues that Milarepa had not taught the path of means and Mahamudra separately, but Gampopa taught the path of means only to suitable recipients for the vajrayana, while he gave the instructions of Mahamudra even without empowerment to those who were suitable re­cipients of the paramitayana. He composed a progressive guidance manual on that called Connate Union, which is also called “The dharma of the Re­alization of Tagpo.” Gampopa said that “it is taught in the scriptures that gurus and students must have many qualities, but for students it is suffi­cient to solely have devotion.” In this way, he gave rise to the realization of Mahamudra after a short time even in some foolish, destitute, and wicked persons. He also established many novices who had not done any study or reflection in such realization. Furthermore, he composed treatises on the progressive stages of the Kadampa teachings and taught many of their oral instructions. Thus, it is said that since that time, the two rivers of Kadampa and Mahamudra have been blended.BA also states that though Gampopa was criticized by some great teach­ers of the scholarly oriented paramitayana to have wasted many bright people through his way of teaching, he answered, “I may be blamed by those who follow the yana of characteristics, but the welfare of beings will increase through these novices of mine.”Elsewhere, BA reports some examples of Gampopas teaching ap­proach.808 When the First Karmapa met Gampopa after having already stud­ied for many years with several Kadampa masters (he studied the Maitreya texts with Chaba Chokyi Senge), Gampopa first taught the Kadampa stages of the path even to such an advanced student as the Karmapa and had him meditate on them. It was only thereafter that the Karmapa received em­powerment and was taught the path of means. Also, as mentioned above, BA says that one of Gampopas four secondary lineage holders, Layagpa Jangchub Ngodrub, had earlier studied the Maitreya texts with his uncle and then also with Jangrawa Dumton. Later, when he met Gampopa and received his blessings, the realization of Mahamudra dawned in him as if he had met an old acquaintance. Subsequently he also received instruc­tions on candall and Cakrasamvara from Gampopa. Later, when Gampopa was about to pass away, two monks requested instructions on the path of means from outside of his quarters but were not admitted by him. One of"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"202 Translators Introductionhis attendants advised them to ask for Mahamudra instead. After they had done so in a loud voice for a long time, Gampopa let them finally enter and gave them Mahamudra instructions.The Third Karmapa, Rangjung DorjeMany texts by the Third Karmapa, though not explicitly linking the Ut­taratantra to Mahâmudrà, combine the approaches and terminologies of Yogàcàra, the Uttaratantra, and Mahamudra. The Karmapa s commen­tary on the Dharmadhàtustava explicitly equates prajnaparamita with Mahamudra and says that both are the characteristics or equivalents of the dharmadhatu, which throughout is understood as being the tathagata heart.809 Given that the tathagata heart is the topic of the Dharma- dhâtustava, it is not surprising that the Karmapas commentary is greatly based on the Uttaratantra (quoting forty-two verses and referring to sev­eral others) and R G W (four quotes, some lengthy). Thus, there is no doubt that the Third Karmapa also subscribed to a connection between the Uttaratantra and Mahamudra.The first, sixth, and ninth chapters of Rangjung Dorjes Profound Inner Reality and its autocommentary present the pure and the impure mind as the causes and conditions of nirvana and samsara, respectively, which is based on Yogàcàra sources on the eight consciousnesses and the four wis­doms as well as on teachings on the tathagata heart (such as from the Ut­taratantra). His Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart is basically a synopsis of the Uttaratantra, while his Distinction between Consciousness and Wisdom represents a digest of the Yogàcàra presentations on the eight conscious­nesses and the four wisdoms. Traditionally, these four texts are considered as a unit, with the latter two being supplements of the first two. They are crucial in their elucidation of how the views and practices of vajrayàna and Mahàmudrà are based on the sütrayàna teachings on buddha nature as the very ground, path, and fruition of these approaches and on minds transi­tion from being obscured in the form of dualistic consciousness to being free as nondual wisdom. Thus, these texts are not just mere philosophical or scholastic treatises, but inform and enhance meditation practice through their profound outlook and their sometimes distinctly experiential style, which is grounded in the Mahàmudrà approach and provides direct med­itation or pointing-out instructions. The commentaries by Jamgon Kong- trul on the latter two texts at times also pick up this approach.In this vein, the eminent contemporary Kagyü scholar and meditation master Thrangu Rinpoche says that Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart and"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 203The Distinction between Consciousness and Wisdom combine scholasticism and reasoning according to the Shentong approach with the Mahâmudrâ tradition of directly familiarizing with the nature of the mind. Thus, in terms of their more theoretical instructions, they present the definitive meaning, and in terms of practice, they correspond to the Mahâmudrâ ap­proach to meditation.810Examples of this approach include the following passages from the au­tocommentary on The Profound Inner Reality:[The meaning of] “beginningless” is as follows. Since a beginning and an end in time are conceptual superimpositions, here, [minds] own essence—be it with stains or stainless—is free from being the same as or other than dependent origination. Since there is no other beginning than that, this is called “beginningless time.” In the very instant of [mind] itself being aware {rigpa) of or realizing its own essence, it is liberated, whereas its not being aware {ma rig pa) of this [essence] is the beginning of mistaken mind, which is called “ignorance.”811And:Due to the unimpeded play of that very minds own essence through momentary consciousnesses, [while] its nature abides as emptiness and it is lucidity by nature (which represents the basis for everything), the individual manifestations of the collections of mental factors and the seven collections of consciousness appear in an unimpeded and mo­mentary way from that [empty and lucid ground]. Therefore, during the phase of [mind] being impure, [these three aspects of minds empty essence, lucid nature, and unimpeded display] are called “mind,” “mentation,” and “consciousness” [respectively].

Therefore, ignorance is produced and, through false"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"204 Translators Introductionimagination, it serves as both the basis [—the alaya-consciousness—] and the condition [—mentation—] of samsara. Since this [mentation] and the alaya[-consciousness] manifest in the form of mutual causes and conditions, just like water and waves, they are incessantly stirring and forming [each other]. Hence, this is ignorance.812Jamgon Kongtruls commentary on Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart says:The meaning of “beginningless” is as follows. Before that essence (the pure nature [of the mind]), there is nothing that could be called “bud- dhahood,” and before the latent tendencies of ignorant mistakenness, there is absolutely nothing that could be called a “sentient being.” The time of samsara and nirvana appearing and being mistaken as two is this very moment,813 it does not come via someplace else, because all phenomena are dependent origination.814Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart states:The one who adopts and rejects these is mistakenness.Through rejecting [minds] own appearances, where should they cease?Through adopting [minds] own appearances, what should come about?Is clinging to duality not delusive?Understanding this is indeed said to be the remedy,But the thought of nonduality is not real [either],For the lack of thought [just] turns into a thought.You thought about emptiness, dissecting form and so on into parts,Are you not mistaken yourself?815The same text also equates the classical Mahamudra term “ordinary mind” with the key theme of the Uttaratantra—the dharmadhatus being understood as the tathagata heart—and relates this to the first two lines of Uttaratantra 1.154:Just this ordinary mindIs called “dharmadhatu” and “heart of the victors.”Neither is it to be improved by the noble ones Nor made worse by sentient beings.816"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 205Furthermore, the text relates the ignorance about one’s true nature and its realization to the three natures of Yogacara:Since we lack certainty about what is, just as it is,We produce the imaginary, construing what is nonexistent as existent. The conceptuality produced by this is the dependent [nature].Through not knowing the perfect,We are agitated by our own doing.Alas, in those who realize these qualities of the dharmakàya To be what is real, this is the knowledge of reality.[Even] their present little power is reality—Casting away this knowledge, we fabricate what is unreal And are carried away by the agitation of pursuing it.Understand now what is, just as it is,And you attain power in it.817On the last two lines, Jamgon Kongtrul’s commentary takes the Mahâmudrâ stance of buddhahood’s being nothing but realizing the nature of the mind for what it is:Since the presence of the dharmakàya in ourselves is realized through study and reflection, understand what is, just as it is—that all qualities [of awakening] exist right now in a complete way in this mind as such, the buddha heart. Through becoming familiar with this understanding, refreshing it again and again, you will realize this, just as it is, which is sufficient—you will directly attain the power of these qualities.818The beginning of The Distinction between Consciousness and Wisdom makes it clear that the entire text is written from the perspective, and for the purpose, of meditation as the process of becoming liberated from mis­takenness and seeing mind’s nature as it is:Having relied on study and reflection,In order to immerse myself in the ways of meditation,While dwelling in seclusion,I will express how this principle [of mistakenness and liberation] appears.819"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"206 Translators IntroductionThe Eighth Karmapa, Mikyô DorjeThe Eighth Karmapas introduction to his commentary on the Madh- yamakâvatâra presents two distinct Kagyii transmissions of Madhya- maka820—the well-known Kagyii lineage through Tilopa, Nâropa, Marpa, and so on, and the lineage of Maitrlpa s “Madhyamaka of mental nonen­gagement,” which is a special lineage of Mahamudra.821 He says that Mai­trlpa realized that the Madhyamaka taught by Saraha, Savaripa, Nâgàrjuna, and Candrakirti has the same meaning and taught it in this way to others. The Karmapa quotes Maitripas Tattvadasaka 2, which says that without the words of the guru, even Madhyamaka is only middling (this basically indicates that sütra-based Mahamudra must include pointing-out instruc­tions). From Maitrlpa, this lineage was passed on to Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, the First Karmapa, and so on. Maitripas cycle of Madhyamaka teachings is known as “the twenty-five dharma works of mental nonen­gagement.” In Tibet, three distinct lineages of the intended meaning of this “Madhyamaka of mental nonengagement” developed:1. The practice that focuses on the profound and luminous Madhya­maka of the mantrayàna2. The practice that focuses on the profound Madhyamaka of the sütras3. The practice that focuses on “the Madhyamaka of False Aspectarian Mere Mentalism”822The latter system explains that the actual meaning of the dohâs of the siddhas lies in the ultimately established, self-aware, and self-luminous cog­nition empty of apprehender and apprehended. This view has been widely taught in India and Tibet by master Vajrapâni (one of Maitrlpa s main stu­dents), Asu from Nepal, Kor Nirupa (1062-1162), and others.823The Karmapa says that Marpa and Milarepa transmitted and accom­plished the entirety of the first two practices, while Gampopa specifically focused on the second practice and widely propagated it. In the Samâdhiràja- sütra, he was the bodhisattva Candraprabhàkumâra and was praised by the Buddha as the one who would later spread the teachings of this sütra. It was Gampopa who gave this system (2) the name “Mahamudra,” which comes from the Yogânuttara class of tantra, in which Mahamudra is well known as the name for the wisdom of bliss-emptiness. When the Madhyamaka view of this system dawns in ones mind stream, this is called “the percep­tion of ordinary mind” or “the perception of the dharmakàya.” When one realizes that the bearers of the nature of phenomena, such as sprouts and"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 207thoughts, are not established as anything other than their true nature, one refers to this realization with the conventional expression “thoughts ap­pearing as the dharmakaya.”The view and meditation of this Mahamudra system as inseparable from Madhyamaka are said to be very necessary in order to eliminate remaining latencies of discursiveness and the impregnations of negative tendencies at the time when extremely pleasant experiences of the vajrayâna s wisdom of the union of bliss and emptiness arise in ones mind. This is called “the sin­gle white panacea,”824 because it eliminates all obscurations without excep­tion. Even a partial dawning of the view and meditation of this Mahamudra in the mind serves as the supreme panacea for the referential grasping at what is held to be inferior (such as seeming reality and adventitious stains) or superior (such as ultimate reality or the nature of phenomena). Without such a remedy, just like medicines turning into poison, the view and med­itation of the freedom from reference points would turn into a view and meditation that are themselves nothing but reference points.At this point, the Karmapa refers to some of the main passages from Jñánakirtis Tattvâvatàra and Sahajavajras Tattvadasakatïkà quoted above, which link Mahàmudrà with prajüàpàramità. He says that the experiential guiding instructions of this Mahàmudrà system do not involve vajrayàna empowerments. This systems explicit teaching is the Madhyamaka of emptiness free from reference points in the sütra tradition, but implicitly it also teaches the ultimate profound actuality of both sütras and tantras— the ordinary and extraordinary sugata heart. With this in mind, Gampopa, Pamo Trupa, Jigden Surngon, and many others have said that “the treatise of our Mahàmudrà is this Mahâyânottaratantrasâstra composed by the Bhagavàn Maitreya.” Gôtsangpa Gônpo Dorje declared that the initiators of this Mahàmudrà are both Saraha and Nàgàrjuna, with Saraha teaching Mahàmudrà from the side of affirmation and Nàgàrjuna teaching it from the side of negation. Therefore, the Karmapa says, I rejoice in the following straightforward words of Gô Lotsàwa:This renowned “Glorious Tagpo Kagyü” is not a lineage of words, but it is the lineage of true reality. This true reality refers to the unbro­ken lineage of the realization of stainless Mahàmudrà. The guru from whom one obtains the realization of Mahàmudrà is presented as ones root guru.825"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"208 Translators IntroductionConsequently, Mikyô Dorje states, though according to the secret man­tra approach in the Kagyü lineage there are no separate guiding instruc­tions on Mahâmudrâ other than those in the Six Dharmas of Nàropa, by virtue of seeing the purport of this true actuality, the followers of this lin­eage distinguish instructions called “The Six Dharmas” and “Mahâmudrâ.”The Karmapa continues that, in addition to the Kagyü lineage, many others in Tibet taught this dharma system of Mahâmudrâ. For example, it is contained in the teachings called The Pacification o f Suffering that the Indian master Padampa Sangye brought to Tibet. In particular, there is the Mahâmudrâ transmissions to Tropu Lotsàwa Jampa Bal826 (1173-1225) by many Indian scholars and siddhas, such as Mitrayogin and the great Kashmiri Pandita Sâkyasrlbhadra who visited Tibet from 1204-1213.827 The portion of the Mahâmudrâ teachings that was later transmitted to the great translators Jamba Lingba,828 Gô Lotsàwa, Trimkang Lotsàwa Sonam Gyaltsen829 (1424-1482), and others, when the great Bengali Pandita Va- naratna (1384-1468) visited Tibet three times830 also belongs to this type of Mahâmudrâ system.831The Eighth Karmapa then presents two other Madhyamaka lineages coming to Tibet from Nàgàrjuna to Atisa (982-1054) and Patsab Lotsàwa, respectively. As for the former lineage, Gampopa received it from Jayiilwa and many other Kadampa masters. An alternative lineage went from Atisa via the Kadampa masters Potowa and Sharawa Yônten Tra832 (1070-1141) directly to the First Karmapa.Here, Mikyô Dorje addresses the issue of whether the Madhyamaka teachings called “Mahâmudrâ” that were transmitted by Maitripa and the Madhyamaka teachings transmitted from Atisa are the same. In terms of the true reality that they teach, he says, there is no difference, but they differ in their approach to realizing this actuality. In Atisas lineage, one deter­mines true reality through conceptual examination and analysis. Then, one rests in meditative equipoise through the knowledge that entails a small degree of clear appearance with regard to the aspect of a nonimplicative negation. In Maitripa s system, just as a fire dies once its wood has been consumed, one determines the nature of this examining and analyzing knowledge itself through seeing that it is baseless and without root. Then one rests in meditative equipoise in that which does not involve any sense of negation or affirmation whatsoever.In several of his works, the Eighth Karmapa warns against a simplis­tic understanding of Mahâmudrâ in general and Gampopas approach to it in particular. Besides the above quote in TOK about “Connate Union"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 209Mahamudra” only being a name that Gampopa and Pamo Trupa gave to the pith instructions in Atisa’s Bodhipathapradipa in order to please those who are fond of very high yanas,833 Mikyo Dorjes commentary on the Madhya- makavatara makes it clear that even Gampopa’s sutra-based Mahamudra approach entails some elements of vajrayana (as also stated by Sahajavajra and others):Some confused... later followers of the Tagpo Kagyii say, “Lord Gam­popa, even without relying on the mantra [approach], has nakedly pointed out the wisdom of Mahamudra to beginners in the nondual wisdom that is solely directed inward, thus manifesting ordinary or primordial mind.” There is no way that Lord Gampopa held such an approach even in his dreams.834The Eighth Karmapa s commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkara says:Those present-day followers of [Maha]mudra whose confusion is even a hundred thousand times bigger than this exclaim, “Through refining the alaya-consciousness into something pure, it turns into the result of mirrorlike wisdom.” This is not justified for the following reasons. Something like this does not appear in any of the traditions of the mahayana . . . A presentation of the alaya-consciousness as the cause and mirrorlike wisdom as its result is not something that is obtained through reasoning. Rather, with respect to the mode of being of causes and results, in terms of [such] causes and results in the abhidharma that actually fulfill these functions (that is, being what produces and what is produced), the alaya-consciousness and mirrorlike wisdom are not adequate as a cause and a result that fully qualify as such. Also, since the very nature of the alaya-consciousness is [nothing but] the adventitious stains, it is presented as impure. No matter how it may be refined by something else, it will not turn into something pure. It is not possible within the sphere of knowable objects that something impure turns into something pure, or that something pure turns into some­thing impure. Some assert that there is the mere factor of lucid and aware mind, and that this is what comprises all the seeds of samsara as well as the seeds of nirvana.

In brief, it is from the perspective of the sixth consciousness itself becom­ing without any characteristics that it is clearly manifest as the actuality of mental nonengagement. However, the explanation nowadays that being free from apprehending generalities—as the kind of cognition that impairs the sixth consciousness—is the view of Mahàmudrà free from mental engagement is nothing but the occurrence of a dharma famine. The manner in which the position of said Chinese master and the Mahàmudrà free from mental engagement do not accord should be understood from my other works.836Mikyô Dorje generally holds that the Mahàmudrà instructions—in the sense of essence Mahàmudrà—originated with Saraha. In his Answers to Lingdrungpas Questions,837 he points to the superiority of this Kagyii Mahàmudrà compared even to the fourth empowerment in the Yogànuttara class of tantra. In answer to the question of whether there is a difference be­tween Gampopa s Mahàmudrà and the Mahàmudrà of the fourth empow­erment, he says that Gampopas Mahàmudrà falls outside the scope of the question of whether it is the same or different from this empowerment. For Jigden Surngon says that this Mahàmudrà is “beyond the four joys, more eminent than luminosity, and untouched by the three great ones.”838 Sara- ha’s Dohakosa too declares that the connate natural state, Mahàmudrà, the purport of the dohàs, cannot be realized through the fourth empowerment:Some engage in the explanation of the purport of the fourth [empowerment],Some understand it as the element of space,And others view it as emptiness,But mostly they have entered what is incompatible [with it].839"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 211Instead, just like Saraha and other siddhas, the Karmapa here champions the most immediate approach to minds nature, which entails discarding any conventional kind of Buddhist practice, including the vajrayâna. He says that within the great primordial freedom from the impurities of the experiences, realizations, and philosophical systems of the four mundane and supramundane empowerments and so forth, one simply settles in an unfabricated natural manner in what appears spontaneously as the primordial buddha, the primordially pristine presence itself. Apart from that, the siddhi of Mahâmudrâ is not accomplished through tiresome activities such as requesting empowerments, ringing a bell, repeating mantras while meditating on a deity, collecting wood to make fire offerings, or carrying out extensive meditation rituals after having collected offering substances. The Karmapa concludes by saying that when Pamo Trupa met Gampopa after already having received the fourth empowerment in the Sakya tradition, he left the experience of Mahâmudrâ in that fourth empowerment behind and realized the Mahâmudrâ of Gampopa s Kagyii— ordinary mind.840 All of this corresponds to Mikyô Dorjes remark in his spiritual memoirs that when teaching Mahâmudrâ, he emphasizes the tradition of the dohàs as transmitted via Maitripa s student Vajrapâni.841As for the relationship between Mahâmudrâ and the tathàgata heart, the Eighth Karmapas Answers to the Questions of Lama Kampa refers to the Third Karmapas Profound Inner Reality's speaking of mind in its two as­pects—pure and impure.842 As for how the impure aspect of mind comes about, minds essence is empty, its nature is lucid, and its expression is unimpeded, but it is ignorant about itself. Therefore, the pristine mind is primordial wisdom {ye shes) but at the same time obscured by ignorance, which is called “consciousness” {mam shes). Conventionally, this wisdom is an existing phenomenon, the natural, self-arisen, inherent, and undeluded tathàgata heart. Now, if there are these two kinds of minds, how can it be held that the essence of thoughts is dharmakàya? It is not incompatible for a single mind stream to entail both the natural state and adventitious stains because these stains are not other in substance than native mind {gnyug ma'i sems), which is equivalent to the dharmakàya and ordinary mind.As mentioned above, the Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhi- samayâlamkâra often equates the tathàgata heart with Mahâmudrâ, even speaking of the “permanent moment of Mahâmudrâ” and “the supreme awareness that is other” (that is, the direct experience of minds nature that is beyond time and dualistic mind).843"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"212 Translators IntroductionTagpo Dashi NamgyalTagpo Dashi NamgyaTs (1512/1513-1587) Moonbeams o f Mahamudra presents several different positions as to whether Mahàmudrà belongs to the sütrayàna, the mantrayána, or neither.844 First, he says, some dohàs and symbolic transmissions of Mahàmudrà explain that among sútra and tan­tra, Mahàmudrà belongs to the latter. Within tantra, among the path of blessing, the path of solace, and the path of direct perception, it represents the third one. They say that one needs either an elaborate or a short ma­turing empowerment and that the yànas preceding this highest one should be cultivated as appropriate since they are like stepping stones. According to the sources of secret conduct, among the three yànas in terms of stu­dents with inferior, medium, and highest intelligence—the pàramitàyàna, the mantrayána, and the yàna of the unsurpassable essence—Mahàmudrà represents the latter. It has the four features of not directly being in accord with the two former yànas, not being in contradiction with them, being in partial accordance with them, and being more eminent than them. Never­theless, these Mahàmudrà transmissions say that one needs some elaborate or short form of empowerment and blessing and one should also meditate on a deity as appropriate. Thus, Mahàmudrà must be considered as a sub­division of the mantrayána.However, if one analyzes what Saraha says, he asserts Mahàmudrà to be a shortcut path called “the path of the essence.” He holds that this paths own nature does not depend on the mantrayána. It is free from the three conditions,845 beyond the four joys, and even more special than luminosity. Still, he speaks in his Queen Doha of how to rely on a karmamudrà, how to mature her through empowerment, and how to engage in yogic conduct, thus saying that if Mahàmudrà is connected with the mantrayána, it is suit­able for that. Saraha, Tilopa, and others also explain that in order to realize perfect wisdom, without the instructions of Mahàmudrà, it is difficult to re­alize the ultimate basic nature—luminous Mahàmudrà—through the paths of sütra or tantra alone.Then, Tagpo Dashi Namgyal refers to Gampopa s above-mentioned di­vision of three paths—taking inference as the path, taking blessing as the path, and taking direct perceptions as the path, which is Mahàmudrà. He also adduces two further ways of Gampopa s making a threefold division of paths. (1) The pàramitàyàna is the path of relinquishing the basis through taking the factors to be relinquished and their remedies to be different. The path of transforming the basis is the mantrayána—the transformation"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 213of ones body into a deity, the transformation of taking afflictions as the path, and the transformation of taking thoughts as wisdom, thus cleansing stains with stains and cutting through thoughts with thoughts. The path of knowing the basis is Mahamudra—there is nothing to be relinquished, no remedy, nothing to be transformed, and nothing that transforms it, but everything is minds display. One becomes a buddha through familiarizing with the recognition that mind’s being primordially unborn exists as the intrinsic dharmakaya. (2) The paramitayana refers to those of dull faculties engaging in the path of accumulation. The mantrayana refers to those of medium faculties who are full of thoughts and afflictions engaging in the path of means. Mahamudra refers to those of sharp faculties who possess prajna engaging in true reality. Therefore, Dashi Namgyal says, Gampopa holds that Mahamudra is a shortcut path separate from both sutra and tantra (Gampopa also sometimes uses the term “path of blessing” for it). Gampopa asserts that when a realized guru guides a qualified student who has left behind all activities of this life, that student will be liberated instan­taneously through the path of Mahamudra without depending on the paths of sutra or tantra.There are two kinds of persons who practice profound true reality—for the fortunate ones with prior training, it is sufficient to teach them the pro­found path in an instantaneous manner, while beginners must be taught this path in a gradual manner. Gampopa holds that this profound path of Mahamudra is a shortcut path independent of tantra and did not say that one needs maturing empowerments as a preliminary for it. Rather, he guided students by relying only on taking refuge in the guru and the three jewels, cultivating love, compassion, and bodhicitta, confessing wrongdo­ing, offering mandalas to the guru and the three jewels, and praying to them with fervent devotion. In this context, those of highest faculties with an instantaneous disposition should first seek for the view and then should be taught the pith instructions on the means to rest in meditative equi­poise on the basis of that view. This corresponds to the contemporary way of guiding students through The Four Letters of Mahamudra.846 Those of inferior faculties with a gradual disposition are progressively guided from calm abiding to superior insight, which corresponds to the contemporary manner of guiding through Connate Union. The reasons for this are un­derstood from the guidance manuals, oral instructions, and questions and answers in Gampopa’s collected works, as well as from the parts of the col­lected works of Pamo Trupa and the First Karmapa that record the oral teachings of Gampopa."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"214 Translators IntroductionHowever, it appears that later followers of this practice lineage, in terms of adapting Mahâmudrâ to the sütrayàna and tantrayàna, have joined Mahâmudrâ with many practices from these yànas, such as required em­powerments, the four common and uncommon preliminaries, and appro­priate stages of enhancement. Thus, to take Mahâmudrâ as the profound path that is in common with sütra and tantra is not contradictory, but to do so is due to the different needs of those with inferior and superior intelli­gence and is in order to enhance realization. Still, if one follows Gampopa s system of practicing Mahâmudrâ alone, there is no need for empower­ments, the meditation of Vajrasattva, visualizing oneself as a deity, and visualizing the guru as Vajradhara, but one just practices the above prelim­inaries taught by Gampopa himself.Dashi Namgyals text does not show any significant linking of Mahâmudrâ and the Uttaratantra—its only quote is Uttaratantra I.63ab among many other quotations to support the description of the nature of the mind as space-like luminosity.Padma KarpoPadma Karpo s Treasure Vault o f Mahâmudrâ quotes three lines from the above-mentioned famous verse about connate minds being the dhar­makàya and so on and then explains its meaning—particularly Gampopas key term “Connate Union”—by greatly relying on the Uttaratantra:Connate mind as such is the dharmakàya.Connate appearances are the light of the dharmakàya.Therefore, the inseparability of appearances and mind is connateness.847What is connate here are connate mind as such and connate appearances. Since Mahâmudrâ free from any sides is labeled as two by minds that fall into one side or the other, it appears as the basic ground and its radiance, just as a single person may be apprehended as a friend or an enemy. Therefore, in terms of the basic ground, Mahâmudrâ is presented as changeless great bliss. In terms of its radiance, it is presented as the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects. The first is the ultimate and the second is the seeming. Hence, the seeming is the cause or the means, while the ultimate is the result or the outcome of the means. The meaning of “changeless” is explained by Uttaratantra 1.5led:"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 215Its true nature of being changeless Is the same before as after.As for “the true nature” here, Uttaratantra 1.155 says that the basic element is empty of what is adventitious but is not empty of the unsurpassable qualities. Thus, since appearances are adventitious, they are taught to be changing. Since the true nature is not like that, it is without anything to change. Hence, it is called “naturally pure.” Since samsara comes about due to the ongoing continuation of what is adventitious, the cause of samsara needs to be purified. This cause is not something far away but simply consists of being distracted from the basic nature. Therefore, it is just through not engaging in being distracted from this nature that samsara ends, and the ending of samsara is nirvana (this is followed by quoting Uttaratantra 1.154). Being distracted arises due to the power of beginningless latent tendencies, and these latent tendencies are planted by improper mental engagement. Being distracted is nothing but being ignorant about such mental engagement because the mind turns to what is other than proper mental engagement. In other words, to move away from mindfulness is what is called “distraction.” Therefore, if improper mental engagement has become pure, there will be only proper mental engagement. Thus, the gurus say that the root of samsara and nirvana is determined by being unaware and aware, respectively. Proper mental engagement is exactly what is explained as the third meaning of the term “mental nonengagement” (amanasikara) above—mentally engaging in a proper manner in the meaning of the letter a, which is prajnaparamita, nonduality, nonarising, and nonceasing. In terms of the vajrayana, nonduality refers to the union of prajna and means, which has the nature of great bliss. In terms of the paramitayana, duality refers to subject and object, which will always be dual for as long as there is mental flux. The identitylessness of all phenomena is free from all flux, without any reference points, and nondual. Therefore, the gurus say that meditation is mental nonengagement. At that time, one cannot assert anything about what is to be looked at, so the view is called “being without any assertions.” Since whatever appears at that time is without anything to be adopted or to be relinquished, conduct is called “being free from adopting and rejecting.” Since appearing and being liberated are simultaneous, the fruition is called “being free from hope and fear.”As for the word “union” in “connate union,” it means to rest in ordinary mind—the unity of connate appearances and mind—without distraction."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"216 Translators IntroductionThe Eighth Si tup a, Chokyi JungneThe commentary by the Eighth Situ Rinpoche on the Third Karmapas Aspiration Prayer of Mahamudra quotes ten verses from the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadhatustava each, clearly relating the Uttaratantra and its main topic of buddha nature with Mahamudra in terms of ground, path and fruition, as well as view and meditation. In its defense of a sutra-based Mahamudra approach without empowerment, the commentary also refers to Maitrlpa, Sahajavajra, and Jnanaklrti as forerunners of that system.Situ Rinpoches text quotes Uttaratantra 1.154 twice. First,848 the verse is quoted as support for saying that the basic natures of body and mind are inseparable, just like ice and water. Therefore, they are called “the union of the two kayas at the time of the ground.” There are no other means to clearly manifest this basic nature than the self-aware direct perception that arises through the power of meditation:There is nothing to be removed in thisAnd not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.Later,849 the same verse is cited as support for saying that the main point with regard to the meditation flaws of dullness and agitation is to directly look at their very essence and rest right within that essence in an uncontrived manner. This is the most profound remedy and is also necessary as the basis for superior insight.Verse 7 of the Aspiration Prayer speaks about the typical fourfold vajra­yana set of (1) the basis of purification, (2) the means of purification, (2) what is to be purified, and (4) the result of purification:Within the basis of purification, mind as such, the union of being lucid and empty,Through the means of purification, the great vajra yoga of Mahamudra,May the stainless dharmakaya manifest as the result of the purificationOf what is to be purified, the stains of adventitious mistakenness."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 217(!) In his comments on the basis of purification,850 Situ Rinpoche quotes Uttaratantra 1.55-57, which speaks about the purity of the minds being the basis of all impure states of mind while not relying on any of them, as the reason for naturally pure minds being the basis of purification. Thus, the ground for everything in samsara and nirvana is the purity of the mind, that is, the basic element or tathagata heart. This is the basis of purification but not what is to be purified since there is nothing whatsoever to be purified in its own essence. This is followed by quoting Dharmadhatustava verses 17 and 22:This basic element, which is the seed,Is held to be the basis of all dharmas.Through its purification step by step,The state of buddhahood we will attain.The sutras that teach emptiness,However many spoken by the victors,They all remove afflictions,But never ruin this dhatu.To wit, the former verse essentially represents a synopsis of the last four vajra points, while the latter one can be understood as an alternative answer (compared to Uttaratantra 1.158-60) to the question in Uttaratantra 1.156 why the buddhas teach the existence of the tathagata heart in sentient beings despite having said before that all knowable objects are empty.Situ Rinpoche continues that the pure mind is endowed with the six­ty-four qualities of maturation and freedom in a nondual manner even at the time of the ground, being obscured only by adventitious stains. There are limitless scriptures that teach that mind is the union of being lucid and being empty, such as Uttaratantra 1.63 s saying that this mind cannot be tainted by adventitious stains because it is naturally luminous:The luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.It is not afflicted by adventitious stains,Such as desire, born from false imagination."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"2i8 Translators IntroductionThere is no being lucid apart from being empty and no being empty apart from being lucid. Thus, they are a union since Uttaratantra I.155cd says that the basic elementIs not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.By contrast, those who explain lucidity and emptiness as two separate things and say that their union refers to these two things becoming coupled stand outside the teachings of the Tathagata.851Commenting on the second line of verse 7 of the Aspiration Prayer (the great vajra yoga of Mahámudrás being the means for purifying that basis to be purified), Situ Rinpoche declares that according to the stages of the guiding instructions of the Tagpo Kagyii, for students who rely on a qual­ified guru, it is fine either way if their practice of Mahamudra is preceded by elaborate empowerments or not. Those without empowerment, by vir­tue of practicing the common, uncommon, and special preliminaries of Mahamudra followed by the main practices of calm abiding and superior insight, gain exceptional realizations through seeing ordinary minds own face, which they had determined before through the pointing-out instruc­tions they received. Such realizations are identical in the ultimate essential point to the realization of Mahamudra that arises through relying on the two stages of generation and completion. Furthermore, due to the different levels of the karmic dispositions of the students and the abilities of the gu­rus, some gain realization solely through the blessing of the transference of wisdom, while others gradually receive the four empowerments and then familiarize with the continuity of the experience of the third empower­ment that is pointed out by the fourth empowerment. Thus, the wisdom of Mahamudra can become manifest through all kinds of means such as these. Though it is beyond being an object of speech, thought, and expression, the above-mentioned basis of purification is clearly experienced in the manner of being a personal experience.Situ Rinpoche declares that the approach of wisdoms being suitable to arise even without being preceded by elaborate empowerments does not fit into the minds of some famous scholars in Tibet who say (a) that Mahamudra is not possible without empowerment and the generation and completion stages and (b) that a good approach to meditation can be based only on the view that is taught in the Madhyamaka texts through extensive reasoning."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 219(a) Situ Rinpoche answers that the first flaw does not apply to this Mahamudra system here because, though it is not held that elaborate empowerments are indispensable for disciples of highest faculties, their Mahamudra practice must definitely be preceded by a vajra masters bless­ings through vajra wisdom. As a result of that, the two stages of generation and completion are de facto definitely present too.Of course, he says, some object that the empowerment of the transfer­ence of blessings does not qualify as an actual empowerment and that the practice of guru yoga does not qualify as the two stages of generation and completion. However, in that case, it would follow that empowerments into a colored-sand mandala and so on are even less qualified as empowerments because an empowerment must be something that is able to give rise to the realization of the actuality of this empowerment in ones mind stream and because the ability of elaborate empowerments to do so is inferior to the one of unelaborate empowerments. Also, it would follow that deity yoga too does not qualify as the stages of generation and completion. For, in the vajrayàna, one must regard the deity and the guru as being nondual, and the deity must be sealed with the guru. Thus, a deity as something sealed without a guru who seals it is just an imputed deity, which will never grant the supreme siddhi of Mahàmudrà. Consequently, since the samàdhi em­powerment or the empowerment of vajra wisdom in our tradition is the supreme among all empowerments, it goes without saying that it qualifies as empowerment. In fact, it is a flaw if a realized guru attempts to guide a student of supreme faculties who is suited for Mahàmudrà through any elaborate empowerments other than this supreme empowerment. This is explained in detail in King Indrabhüti’s JMnasiddhi, which says that all supreme siddhis are accomplished through this vajra wisdom empower­ment and describes the disastrous results of empowering someone with a physical mandala if one possesses the entirety of perfect wisdom. Since the dividing line between receiving and not receiving an empowerment is whether or not the actuality of the empowerment has dawned in ones mind stream, it must be understood that one has received the vase empower­ment if the realization of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness has arisen in ones mind. The same goes for the other three empowerments.Likewise, guru yoga alone is sufficient as the two stages of generation and completion because the appearance of the entirety of phenomenal ex­istence as the display of the guru through the power of guru yoga is far more effective in stopping clinging to ordinary appearances than even deity yoga. Also, many tantras say that the guru embodies all the jewels and that"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"220 Translators Introductionall siddhis will be attained through meditating on the guru. As for the com­pletion stage, to sustain the experience of ones minds having become with­out reference points through intense devotion is held to be the supreme path free from all obstacles and points to go astray.(b) The second flaw does not apply here either. From the perspective of the freedom from reference points, the view of mantra Mahâmudrâ is in accord with Madhyamaka. Therefore, not852 realizing the view of Mad­hyamaka cannot be a flaw of the mantrayâna. Furthermore, since Madhya­maka dialectics are merely taught for the sake of rebutting the disputes of tirthikas, Màdhyamikas do not even consider analytical meditation as their very own system because Maitripa says in Tattvadasaka 2cd:Not adorned with the guru s words,The middle is just middling.Thus, just as the Eighth Karmapa above, Situ Rinpoche here advocates personal pointing-out instructions by a guru as being the essence of even the Madhyamaka path. He continues with a quote from Sakya Pandita as the reason why Mahâmudrâ accords with the Madhyamaka view in terms of all reference points having subsided:If there were a view higher than Madhyamaka,That view would entail reference points.853Accordingly, a view that is superior to the Madhyamaka free from reference points is impossible in the teachings of the Buddha. With this in mind, Jfiànakïrtis Tattvâvatâra explains that the prajüàpàramità taught in the sütras and mantra Mahâmudrâ are synonyms:Another name of Mother Prajüàpâramità is Mahâmudrâ because it is the very nature of nondual wisdom.854As for the critique of Mahàmudràs being the system of Hvashang,855 Situ Rinpoche confirms that many instructions on Mahâmudrâ emphasize that it is essential not to pursue thoughts about the past, the present, and the future. Some people say about this, “Since your Mahâmudrâ is to stop all mental engagement in terms of the three times, it is the meditation of the Chinese Hvashang.” However, Situ Rinpoche says, these people just talk without having properly examined the issue, since the Kagyü lineage"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 221does not hold that one should rest within a state of thoughts having ceased through deliberately stopping all mental engagement. Rather, it is held that the present fresh mind is sustained in an uncontrived manner. Still, these people may think, “Even if that is the case, you are not beyond the flaw mentioned, since all thoughts in terms of the three times will cease on their own through sustaining the present mind in an uncontrived manner.” This just shows that such people are very attached to their thoughts and thus cannot let go of them. Since there seem to be very many people who have such a “pure” view, they are more than welcome to join in relishing their thoughts and have no need to analyze this here. As for us, Situ Rinpoche concludes, we never embarked on any path other than the one taught by the sugatas and traveled by the mighty siddhas.(3) Now, what is to be purified by the means of purification within the basis of purification consists of the dualistic phenomena of apprehender and apprehended that do not exist in the basic ground but are produced by adventitious mistakenness.(4) The result of the purification of these stains is the manifestation of the dharmakaya, that is, the fundamental nature of the ground, in which all such adventitious dualistic phenomena have been relinquished. As Dhar- madhatustava 37 says:Covered by the web of the afflictions,It is called a “sentient being.”Once its free of the afflictions,It should be expressed as “Buddha.”As for the teaching that the Buddha sees the dharmadhatu just as it is and the teaching that mind is self-aware and self-lucid, Situ Rinpoche says,856 the following must be understood. Not seeing even an atom of something that could serve as a characteristic within the dharmadhatu free from all reference points is expressed as “the great seeing of wisdom.” That this is free from something to be aware of and something that is aware, or something to be made lucid and something that makes it lucid, is called “awareness” and “lucidity.” One needs to understand this secret essential point and not take said teachings as being equivalent to the perceptions of worldly people. Otherwise, to speak of minds being aware of itself by itself is self-contradictory, accruing the flaws of being like a sword that cannot cut itself and so on that are exposed in the Lankdvatarasutra, the Bodhicaryavatara, and other texts."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"222 Translator's IntroductionHowever, the nature of the mind is not to be taken as utterly nonexis­tent or completely unobservable either. If the basic element of naturally pure mind were nonexistent, even on the level of what is merely seeming, it would not be tenable for the appearances of samsara and nirvana to oc­cur since one only speaks of samsara and nirvana due to the distinction of whether this fundamental ground is not realized or realized, respectively. This is clearly expressed in verses 11, 16, and 17 of the Dharmadhatustava.Here, the following essential point is to be understood. Though all phe­nomena of samsara and nirvana that appear as characteristics never existed in the basic ground, this does not contradict the fact that this basic ground provides the space in which everything can appear. Though this is expressed as “the vajra of mind,” “the naturally pure basic element,” and so on, it is impossible for something that entails the extreme of being absolutely real and permanent to exist. “But how can this be reconciled with the sutras of the final dharma wheel’s speaking of the paramitas of purity, permanence, bliss, and self (see Uttaratantra 1.35-58), as well as the vajrayana’s speaking of ‘invincible and indestructible wisdom’ and so on?” This is answered in Mahdydnasutralamkdra IX.78:It is precisely nonexistence That is the supreme existence.Nonobservability in all respects Is the supreme observation.857Accordingly, this refers to the naturally pure true reality that cannot be split by any characteristics or reference points, is beyond being an object of mind, and never changes into any other state. The purpose of teaching it in positive terms is to dispel the clinging to emptiness because the sutras and Nagarjuna say that such clinging is even worse than views about permanence. The reason for this is that emptiness was taught in order to dismantle any reification, but if one reifies emptiness, it is an even graver reification than any mundane one. This is similar to taking an emetic in order to dispel a disease and the emetic itself then turning into poison.858Situ Rinpoche also explains the meaning of the well-known Kagyii ex­pression “thoughts are dharmakaya.”859 He says that all these phenomena that appear as mere thoughts do not go beyond the dharmadhatu that is great bliss. Therefore, from the very moment of their appearance, they are established as the dharmakaya. This is similar to the reflection of the moon in water, which does not go beyond the substance of water, being"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 223established as water from the very moment of its appearance. However, Situ Rinpoche clarifies, it should be understood that we Kagyüpas never say that by virtue of thoughts being the dharmakàya, one will be liberated merely through continuing to conceptually examine them.Later,860 our text relates the Uttaratantra to the fact that the names and meanings of all profound and vast dharmas are included in Mahâmudrâ, which is thus the single white panacea, and also defends “the Mahâmudrâ of mental nonengagement.” The meaning of “profound” here refers to ac­tually being of one taste as emptiness. The meaning of “vast” refers to the mere means that enable one to directly or indirectly engage in Mahâmudrâ. As Uttaratantra 1.147 says:The teaching of the principle of subtle profundity Is like the single taste of honey.The teaching of the principle of diverse aspectsShould be understood to resemble a kernel in its various husks.Therefore, this is the final meaning taught by all the various discourses of the Sugata. Through realizing just this, one will arrive at the ground of all dharmas, perfect all qualities, and relinquish all obscurations. Hence, it was also given the name “single white panacea.” It is not contradictory for this term to likewise refer to the meditation that makes one realize Mahâmudrâ since the opening verse of Dignàga s Prajnâpâramitâsarngraha says:Prajiïàpàramità is nondual wisdom,Which is the Tathàgata.By virtue of being connected to this actuality to be accomplished,It is [also] the term for both the [related] scriptures and the path.Thus, Situ Rinpoche again links Mahâmudrâ not only with the Uttaratantra but also with prajnàpàramità.He continues that some highly esteemed analytical scholars are con­cerned about the explanation of Mahâmudrâ as lacking mental engage­ment. However, there is no flaw because the first letter a in amanasikâra teaches identitylessness, nonarising, and so on, that is, the meaning of the emptiness that is beyond all reference points. The remaining letters teach the mental engagement that is free from mental engagement and lacks any clinging even to emptiness. Thus, the meaning of this term is established as the Mahâmudrâ of union free from reference points. This is followed by"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"224 Translators Introductionseveral supporting quotations from the Manjusrindmasamgiti, the Hevajra- tantra, the Avikalpapravesadharani, and the passage on the etymology of amanasikara from Maitripas Amanasikdradhara that was already pre­sented above.Shortly thereafter,861 Situ Rinpoche has someone object, “If your Mahamudra belongs to the four mudras, shouldn’t it be preceded by prac­ticing the other three mudras?” According to the tantras, those of highest faculties can enter Mahamudra right from the start. It is not even contra­dictory to say that some who lack the highest faculties can still engage in Mahamudra meditation at the beginning. To say that Mahamudra practice must necessarily be preceded by practicing the other three mudras is very absurd for the following reasons. There are many well-known and authen­tic records in both India and Tibet of siddhas effortlessly eliciting wisdom in their most gifted disciples merely through blessings or symbols, with­out any need for bestowing empowerments, giving reading transmissions, and imparting instructions. Still, it is not that the wisdom of Mahamudra can only come about in the context of “the descent of wisdom,” but there are many explanations on different ways of accomplishing Mahamudra through any one of the other three mudras. Therefore, it is only our own system “Connate Union” established by Gampopa that possesses many different approaches due to the varying capacities of both masters and students.This is followed by a passage that is another clear reference to what later became called “sutra Mahamudra.” It also indicates that students who start out with it can “upgrade” their capacities and thus eventually become suitable for tantra or essence Mahamudra. Situ Rinpoche says that among these many approaches to realize Mahamudra, there is the acclaimed man­ner of guiding those who are not suitable recipients for the extraordinary vajrayana but who possess the general mahayana disposition in either a certain or an uncertain way. Though they do not receive instructions on the other three mudras, when the wisdom of union of the paramitayana finally arises in them through this path, their disposition shifts to being one of those with sharpest faculties in the mantrayana. Therefore, through special blessings and pointing-out instructions, they can then accomplish the supreme siddhi of Mahamudra. There are different opinions as to whether the wisdom of union of the paramitayana itself is Mahamudra. Our own system does not speak out clearly on this matter, but it is obvious that we hold that from the perspective of the view, the two systems of the"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 225pàramitàyàna and Mahàmudrà are not different. This can be understood from carefully reading Sahajavajra’s Tattvadasakatïkà.At the end of his commentary,862 Situ Rinpoche elaborates further on the two approaches of Mahàmudrà that he briefly referred to above: (1) the uncommon tantra system and (2) the system that blends sütra and tantra. (1) In the first system, there are two approaches: (a) The first one consists of a powerful gurus conferring only the vajra wisdom empowerment upon a student of supreme faculties, without the need for preceding elaborate em­powerments. In this approach, for students of instantaneous disposition, they become liberated merely through the blessings of this empowerment, being shown a symbol, or just a very short instruction, as is evident from many examples in India and Tibet. From among the two approaches of the elaborate path of means and the unelaborate path of Connate Union, this is the latter, (b) Those of lesser faculties who have the disposition of pro­gressing in a gradual fashion need to go through the preliminaries as out­lined by the Third Karmapas Guiding M anual on Connate Union—taking some type of pràtimoksa vows, taking the bodhisattva vows, and receiving the elaborate kinds of empowerments, in the Kagyii School usually in the mandala of Cakrasamvara. Thereafter, there are two ways to practice. One is to engage in the generation stage and, once one has become familiar with that, to engage in the completion stage yogas without characteristics. The other one is to first become a little bit familiar with the yogas of calm abid­ing and superior insight without characteristics and then to engage in the generation stage. By virtue of that, lucid appearances in the latter will be attained easily, and siddhis will be found swiftly. In both cases, after the generation stage, completion stage practices with and without character­istics are practiced in a unified manner such that they enhance each other.(2) The system that blends sütra and tantra was developed by Maitrlpa through clearly bringing out what Saraha and his successors had asserted. Maitrlpa also wrote the Tattvadasaka, which teaches this approach and thus represents the original approach of this system. Later, Gampopa adorned this approach with the instructions of Atisa on the stages of the path of the three kinds of individuals that he had heard from his Kadampa teachers. Thus, he is well known as the one who united the two streams of Kadampa and Mahàmudrà. Since this system enables one to arrive at the siddhi of Mahàmudrà in a comparatively short time, it well deserves the name “The Guiding Instructions of Connate Union without Meditation.” Gampopa said, “Just as I saw in my dreams and as predicted by Milarepa, I bene­fited many beings through the Kadampa teachings” and “The little bit of"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"226 Translators Introductionbenefit that I bring to sentient beings at present is due to the kindness of the Kadampa gurus.” He also dreamt of many deer listening to him playing a drum and that he then distributed milk to them. All this shows that this system has a specific purpose. For the intention behind it is that at the time of the degenerations being rampant, there are only very few disciples suit­able for the extraordinary vajrayâna. However, by way of guiding people of inferior faculties through the stages of the path of the three kinds of indi­viduals, they eventually become students of highest faculties and suitable vessels for the vajrayâna. Thus, they can attain liberation in a single lifetime or will at least see the true reality of Mahâmudrâ through these methods and be established on the path of irreversibility.Therefore, Situ Rinpoche says, to the present day there is this approach of guiding all students of higher and lower faculties without needing to ex­amine them. However, when the profound path of means of the vajrayâna is taught on top of this approach, the latter is called “the instructions of the causal period of this vajrayâna” or “the guiding instructions of the ground.” The reason for its being unnecessary to examine the mind streams of those to be guided here is obvious in the case of those who engage in this system through having faith in the profound actuality of Mahâmudrâ, but even those who entertain doubts will gain great benefit. As the Ratnâvalï says:By virtue of a little merit, about this dharma Not even the slightest doubt arises.But even the arising of doubt about it Will tear [samsâric] existence to shreds.863In brief, let alone tantra Mahâmudrâ, even the Mahâmudrâ that blends sütra and tantra is much swifter than the regular pàramitàyàna.Situ Rinpoches commentary concludes with the lineages of (1) tantra Mahâmudrâ and (2) sütra Mahâmudrâ,864 saying that (1) was transmitted from Vajradhara to Tilopa, Nàropa, and Marpa. Another lineage of this approach came to Marpa through Vajradhara, Ratnamati, Saraha, Savaripa, and Maitripa. Thus, Marpa brought these two lineages together and then passed them on to Milarepa, Gampopa, and so on. (2) The Mahâmudrâ approach of the union of sütra and tantra was only transmitted in the lin­eage from Saraha. Since this latter approach was adorned by Gampopa with the stages of the path of the Kadampa School, it also contains this schools three lineages of vast conduct, profound view, and practice through blessings.

The second lineage went from the Buddha to Mañjusrl, Nàgàrjuna, Àryadeva, Candrakïrti, the Elder and Younger *Vidyàkokila, and Atisa. The third lin­eage was transmitted by Vajradhara through Tilopa, Nâropa, Domblpa, and Atisa. Thus, all three came together in Atisa, from whom they continued in Tibet to Dromtonpa, Chenngawa Tsiiltrim Bar866 (1038-1103), Jayiilwa Shônnu Ô, and Gampopa. Another way that the Kadampa lineage reached Gampopa was through his studies with Néusurpa Yeshé Bar, Nyugrumpa Dsôndrii Gyaltsen, Gya Jagriwa, and Shawa Lingpa.867Other Kagyü Masters on Mahâmudrâ and the UttaratantraThe Ultimate Profound Path o f M ahâmudrâ by the controversial Lama Shang Yutragpa Dsôndrü Tragpa868 (1123-1193; a student of Gampopa and his nephew) includes some passages that are identical or very similar to what the Uttaratantra say s. For example:As for the heart of the ultimate definitive meaning, the dharmakàya,The naturally pure and luminous expanse,No matter whether the victors of the three times appear or do not appear,Whether the assemblies of the noble ones realize it or do not realize it, Whether the sages teach it or do not teach it,Or whether the commentators on the intention comment on it or do not comment on it,This pure and luminous true nature free from reference pointsIs primordially and spontaneously present without any increase or decrease.Within pure space, worlds are formed and perish,Are burned through fire, scattered by wind, and so on.Though such destructions occur for many immeasurable eons,Space lacks being harmed, lacks change, lacks increase, and lacks decrease.Due to primordially luminous sunlights being obscured by clouds, Darkness reigns, but when the cloud banks clear, there is brightness. Though it appears as if there were increase and decrease,"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"228 Translators IntroductionIt is impossible for the heart of the sun to increase or decrease.This unchanging dharmakaya that abides like thatIs nothing but your own mind—it does not exist anywhere else.It is not established as a self—when examined, it has no essence.It is not without a self—it is the great self free from reference points.869Per K. Sorensen reports that there are several texts by an early representative of the Tropu Kagyii870 subschool, Jegom Sherab Dorje871 (1140/50-1220), that follow Gampopas blend of sütra-based and lamrim-tiered Kadampa teachings with the Uttaratantra-bzsed Mahàmudrà instructions of the Kagyii School.872As Mathes (2008a, 41) points out, Jigden Sumgôn subscribed to Gam­popas reported position that the Uttaratantra is the basis of Kagyii Mahàmudrà. A text on the three dharma wheels by one of Jigden Sumgôn s students states:Mahàmudrà is seriously engaged through making efforts In the guiding instructions on this Uttaratantra,Which is what I heard from Jigden [Sum]gon again and again.873The commentary on this text says that the Mahàmudrà that Jigden Sumgôn himself practiced was in accordance with the Uttaratantra and that the qualities of Mahàmudrà are taught in the Uttaratantra with the exact same purport.874Mathes (2008a, 113-25) also discusses some aspects of the position of the Drugpa Kagyii master Barawa Gyaltsen Balsang (1310-1391) on bud­dha nature, which combines more scholarly explanations based on the Ut­taratantra with a more experiential approach concordant with Mahàmudrà (though Barawa never uses that term). For example, Barawa defines the tathàgata heart obscured by adventitious stains as being characterized by the inseparability of its being lucid, aware, and empty, which is a frequent description of minds nature in Mahàmudrà. He also explains that these stains simply refer to minds nature temporarily not recognizing itself:Being lucid refers to this àlayas—bodhicitta—being clear, without be­ing tainted by any obscuring stains that are established as entities. It is aware because it is not matter and thus knows happiness and suffering as [mentioned] above. It is empty because it lacks any color and shape."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 229These three are inseparable. When divided [into its phases], [its phase of] having adventitious stains is the sugata heart of sentient beings. The sugata heart that exists in sentient beings possesses adventitious stains. The mistakenness of this very [sugata heart] itself not realizing its own basic nature is mistakenness, which is ignorance. Ignorance is taught to be the afflictions and adventitious stains. The true luminous nature abiding within the cocoon of the afflictions is called “the sugata heart obscured by adventitious stains.” Its being lucid and clear, with­out being obscured by any impurities other than that ([such as] be­ing established as entities of color and shape), is called “luminosity” and “the pure nature.” Ignorance is that this very [luminosity] does not recognize its own face. It is under the influence of that condition [of ignorance] that it appears as all kinds of apprehenders and appre­hended [objects], which means to roam in samsara. Therefore, this is the seed of samsaric phenomena or the sugata heart of sentient beings.. . . Through making this true nature a living experience, the karmic and afflictive [obscurations] including their latent tendencies of this [luminosity] that abides within the cocoon of karma and afflictions will become pure. Through that, the luminous true nature becomes mani­fest, which is the dharmakaya or sugata heart of the buddhabhumi.875Minds failure to recognize its own essence leads to the plethora of thoughts that are oriented toward what seems to be on the outside instead of minds looking inwardly at itself. This is what is called “alaya-conscious­ness” and “sentient being”:[The alaya-consciousness] is the basic awareness that is the sugata heart [in its form] of the impure alaya. Mistakenness [occurs] through its not recognizing its own face. Through that, all kinds of externally oriented thoughts arise.... Since it functions as the basis of samsaric phenom­ena, it is the impure alaya-consciousness. Since it lacks the qualities such as the powers, it is referred to as a sentient being.876Naturally, as the reverse side of nonrecognition, liberation, buddha- hood, or the dharmakaya are nothing other than the tathagata heart recog­nizing its own true nature. Thus, buddha natures not recognizing itself is called “alaya-consciousness” and its recognition is “the alaya of wisdom.” In this context, similar to Go Lotsawa, Barawa holds that the tathagata heart is the single ground of both samsara and nirvana and at the same"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"230 Translators Introductiontime criticizes Dolpopa’s well-known position that the ground of samsara and the ground of buddhahood are disconnected like two distinct king­doms by reinterpreting this position as being only a weak division in terms of isolates (which is obviously not what Dôlpopa had in mind):When this sugata heart recognizes its own face, thus becoming without mistakenness and holding its own ground, it is the dharmakàya of a buddha. Since it functions as the support of the kàyas, wisdoms, deeds, and enlightened activities of the buddhabhümi, it is the pure àlaya of wisdom—buddhahood. The impure àlaya of consciousness does not function as the basis of the attributes of the buddhabhümi because it lacks the qualities such as the powers. The pure àlaya of wisdom does not function as the basis of samsàra because it lacks the adventitious stains and therefore does not experience samsàric happiness, suffering, and so on. Therefore, if divided in terms of isolates, [Dolpopa] asserts that [these two] are two distinct kingdoms. However, since the nature of these two àlayas is the sugata heart, their essence is one.877Later, Barawa comes back to the three features of minds being lucid, aware, and empty and connects them with typical Mahâmudrâ terms used for experiencing minds nature in meditation. He says that such experi­ences represent ultimate reality even during the time of the path, which accords with the Mahâmudrâ approach of working with direct perceptions of minds ultimate nature from the very start:This triad of being lucid, aware, and empty is inseparable, which is ulti­mate reality, unchanging throughout the entirety of ground, path, and fruition. Its way of appearing is unimpeded—in accordance with the influence of latent tendencies, it appears as all kinds of apprehenders and apprehended [objects], which is seeming reality. At the time of cultivating the path, minds triad of being lucid, aware, and empty is experienced as being vivid [sal le], vibrant [singnge], and crisp [hrigge], just like the clear autumn sky. This is [also] ultimate reality.878In another one of his works, Barawa again emphasizes that the differ­ence between the factors to be relinquished and wisdom is nothing but minds nature not recognizing or recognizing itself. Also, once it has been recognized, this recognition is irreversible and does not disappear again:"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 231There is nothing to be relinquished that is different from [mind’s] true nature not recognizing its own face. Therefore, once that true nature recognizes itself, wisdom—the remedy for what is to be relinquished— arises. That is, [what is to be relinquished] has become nonexistent be­cause it is [nothing but] the true nature’s not recognizing its own face. Therefore, though what is to be relinquished has become nonexistent, the recognition of [the true nature’s] own face has not become nonex­istent. Hence, the remedy will not become nonexistent.879This is illustrated by the common Mahamudra example of water and ice:Water freezes through conditions of coldness such as wind. Though it then has become like a stone, water and ice have a single nature, and the ice melts through conditions such as fire. Through that, the ice has become nonexistent but the water will not become nonexistent.880In his A Pronouncement o f Realization, the Sixth Shamarpa, Chôkyi Wangchug, first establishes the correct Kagyii view of Shentong and then, based on this view, quotes Uttaratantra 1.154 as indicating how to correctly cultivate Mahàmudrà and avoid flaws:The unmistaken way of meditation is as follows.Since the meaning of the word “ordinary”[In “ordinary mind”] refers to being uncontrived,No matter whether you contrive it as existent or nonexistent,Whether you contrive it by saying, “Just this is it,”Or whether you contrive it by saying, “This is not it,”It is simply contrived, but not ordinary.With nothing to cultivate other than merely being undistracted,Leaving this vivid presenceFree from a mind with something to meditate onIs this tradition’s way of meditating.However, these days, when giving guidance,[Some] may say, “Look right at whatever thought arises And it will dissolve in its own place and vanish.There is nothing more superior than that, my son!”Through looking in this way,Beginners may pride themselvesWith the mere dissolution of that thought as being a great experience,"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"232 Translators IntroductionLike “freedom from reference points” or “nonmeditation,”And thus are seized again by the demon of pride.Some people may say,“Look at just this thought!”Then, by propping up that thought,Pride arises, [thinking,] “I saw mind’s true face!”Since there is this secret essential point,You need neither empty it out deliberately to be empty Nor purposely make up some transparent lucidity—Just looking nakedly will suffice.With that in mind, lord [Maitreya] said,“There is nothing to be removed from it And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.”881In the context of ground Mahamudra, The Bright Torch by Dsele Natso Rangdrol882 (born 1608) relates both the Uttaratantra and typical Shentong explanations to Mahamudra, equating Mahamudra with the perfect nature and its obscurations with the dependent nature. The text also refers to these two as “the alaya” and “the alaya of various latent tendencies,” respectively.883 The basic alaya is said not to be a mere emptiness but the self- illuminating self-awareness that is the ever-unchanging tathagata heart as the cause of all buddha qualities and is only covered by adventitious stains. Natso Rangdrol explains in detail that Mahamudra is the unconditioned dharmadhatu, which is the great emptiness free from arising, abiding, and ceasing as well as the naturally present three kayas. Those who realize it are called “buddhas” and those who do not are called “sentient beings.” Saraha said in his Dohakosa that “the mind alone is the seed of all—samsara and nirvana emanate from it.” Thus, there is one essence with two aspects, and these aspects simply appear as the result of its being realized or not. However, in itself, the essence of these two aspects never changes, nor is it ever stained. In the general yana, this is called “the unchanging perfect nature.” This undifferentiated neutral essence is also called “alaya” because it is the basis for all of samsara and nirvana. It is not a total emptiness in which there is nothing whatsoever; similar to a mirror and its clarity, there is an unimpeded self-illuminating awareness. The wisdom aspect of self-illuminating awareness is the essence of the awareness that is the inseparability of emptiness and lucidity. It is the seed or cause of all buddha"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 233qualities and thus equivalent to all synonyms of nirvana, such as the tathagata heart, prajnaparamita, the dharmakaya, self-awareness, and the buddhahood of ones own mind. The dullness aspect of the essential alaya is to obscure itself through not knowing its own true nature, which is called “innate ignorance” and “the alaya of various latent tendencies.” From it, all afflictions and deluded thoughts arise. Thus, the six consciousnesses and their objects represent the dependent nature. Hence, the terms “liberation” and “delusion” refer only to whether there is freedom from the stains of ignorance and illusory thought or not. According to Uttaratantra 1.5led, minds primordially pure nature—self-arising wisdom free from all reference points—is changeless before and after. The adventitious stains or innate ignorance are like discolorations on gold, arising from itself and obscuring itself. As for how samsara and nirvana can be divisions of the single alaya, camphor as a medicine can be either beneficial or harmful, depending on whether the illness is of a hot or cold type. Also, poison can be transformed into medicine by certain methods but is deadly without these methods. Likewise, one is liberated if one recognizes the essence of the alaya but remains deluded if not. This difference is simply the result of having or not having realization.In the present Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche’s commentary on the Third Karmapas Aspiration Prayer o f M ahamudra,884 which—according to its colophon—is greatly based on instructions by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso Rinpoche, verse 7 is explained by using the Uttaratantra and also linking Mahamudra with Shentong:Within the basis of purification, mind as such, the union of being lucid and empty,Through the means of purification, the great vajra yoga of Mahamudra,May the stainless dharmakaya manifest as the result of the purificationOf what is to be purified, the stains of adventitious mistakenness.The commentary begins by quoting verse 11 of the Dharmadhatustava:If this element exists, through our work,We will see the purest of all gold.Without this element, despite our toil,Nothing but misery we will produce."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"234 Translators IntroductionBased on this verse, Sangyé Nyenpa Rinpoche explains that the qualities of tathâgatagarbha (the disposition or the basic element) or mind as such (the nature of the mind that is the basis of purification) exist in the mind streams of all sentient beings, due to which it is feasible to make efforts on the path, relinquish what is to be relinquished, and attain the result. This resembles the example of melting, purifying, and refining gold nuggets and thus obtaining the result of purest gold due to all the qualities of golds already existing in the nuggets. Without that tathâgatagarbha, all efforts on the path would be like trying to obtain purest gold through melting, purifying, and refining brass—other than tiring oneself out, no such result will be obtained. Therefore, during the phase of the ground, the qualities of the phase of the result abide as a potential that is suitable to be matured. At the time of the ground, this is called “mind as such.” The words “as such” in this expression refer to being uncontrived, the actual basic nature, or the natural state. This mind as such is not newly produced by causes and conditions but exists primordially in an intrinsic manner. This is the meaning of “the basis of purification.”The qualities of this mind as such consist of the inseparable union of its being empty and luminous, which is the actual way of being of mind. This luminosity is not emphasized in the middle turning of the wheel of dharma since it mainly speaks of emptiness. However, in the pith instructions of Mahâmudrâ, Dzogchen, and so on, mind is not mere emptiness but its lu­minous aspect is emphasized and thus discussed in detail. As Uttaratantra 1.63 says:The luminous nature of the mind Is completely unchanging, just like space.It is not afflicted by adventitious stains,Such as desire, born from false imagination.Accordingly, though the adventitious stains exist based on the luminous nature of the mind as something that can be separated from it, they never taint this nature. Uttaratantra I.30ab states:It is always unafflicted by nature,Just as a pure jewel, space, and water.Thus, though mind as such and the stains coexist, the stains never obscure the nature of this mind as such. Through realizing minds basic nature, it"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 235will become naturally free from its stains since they are separable. However, though this luminous basic nature exists intrinsically in all sentient beings since the very beginning, due to not identifying it, they are bound by thoughts about a self and others.This luminosity is expressed in a twofold manner as “ground luminosity” and “path luminosity.” Ground luminosity—the connately existing intrinsic qualities in the mind streams of all sentient beings, no matter whether they have or have not been recognized—constitutes the ground for the dawning of path luminosity. This luminous mind must be found through simply resting within nothing but the present moment of cognition—it is impossi­ble to find through stubbornly clinging to what is outside. Luminosity is the true nature of the mind, from which it can never be separated, just like fire and its heat or the sun and its light. Though this ground luminosity exists primordially and intrinsically, it is difficult to recognize without the domi­nant condition of relying on a guru and his or her instructions. Therefore, to recognize it newly through familiarizing with it by connecting it with the gurus pith instructions is called “path luminosity.” Ultimately, however, it is completely beyond all thought, speech, expression, and example and thus cannot be explained. As Uttaratantra 11.32-33 declares:Since it is subtle, it is not an object of study.Since it is the ultimate, it is not [an object] of reflection.Since it is the depth of the nature of phenomena,It is not [an object] of worldly meditation and so forth.For naive beings have never seen it before,Just as those born blind [have never seen] form.Even noble ones [see it only] as an infant [would glimpse]The orb of the sun while lying in the house of a new mother.Thus, it is taught that even the noble ones cannot directly perceive it exactly as it is, just as a newborn baby only experiences some uncomfortable feeling when the radiance of the morning sun outside shines on its face.This luminosity is permanent, really established, everlasting, established by its own nature, existing at all times, without arising and ceasing, un­changing, and solid. When this is related to Rangtong, there are many de­bates, while especially Yumowa Mikyo Dorje, Dolpopa, and Sakya Chogden have established it through many scriptures and reasonings. However, the luminosity that is endowed with all these qualities cannot be explained as"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"236 Translators Introductionit is through connecting verbal objects of expression and means of expres­sion—it is completely beyond them and thus inconceivable. As Uttaratan­tra 11.69 states:Because of being unutterable, because of consisting of the ultimate, Because of not being examinable, because of being beyond example, Because of being unsurpassable, and because of not being included in [samsaric] existence or [nirvànic] peace,The sphere of the Buddha is inconceivable even for the noble ones.You may wonder, “Is the luminous nature of the mind empty?” It is empty but being empty is not necessarily being self-empty. The meaning of self- empty is that all phenomena that make up seeming reality are not really established in their own place, which means that they are empty of a nature of their own. But here it is not explained that luminosity is empty of a nature of its own. Rather, ground luminosity is primordially empty of what is other than it—the adventitious stains on it—or characteristics. This is what is called “empty” here, and it is in those terms that the union of being empty and luminous is established. On top of that union, the adventitious stains are present in the manner of being separable from it and therefore have never ever tainted the true nature.As for the second line, “the means of purification, the great vajra yoga of Mahàmudrà,” those separable stains are purified by the means of purifi­cation that consist of the progressive yogas of Mahàmudrà that ultimately manifest ground luminosity just as it is. However, before one engages in these yogas, one first needs to recognize at least a coarse form of this lumi­nosity through the pointing-out instructions.Just as in TOK above, the progression of making what one has recog­nized a living experience consists of three stages: (1) first giving rise to the meditation that has not arisen (the four preliminaries), (2) the threefold pointing-out in order to stabilize this meditation once it has arisen, and (3) the enhancement. The common and uncommon preliminaries are likewise said to correspond to “the minds turning into the dharma” and “the dhar- ma’s turning into the path,” respectively, from among the four dharmas of Gampopa. The next two dharmas of “the paths dispelling delusion” and “delusion s dawning as wisdom” are then discussed through explaining the verse from The Tantra o f Inconceivable Connateness on connateness in a similar (but more detailed) manner as TOK does.885"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 237As for the fourth line, “What is to be purified, the stains of adventitious mistakenness,” through relying on subtle and not just coarse scriptures and reasonings, one will first be able to identify the adventitious stains, rely on their powerful remedy in between, and finally destroy them at their root. For that, one needs to rely on intense efforts and prajnà. For all beings are very greatly habituated to the latent tendencies of the solid appearances of mistakenness, so that it is difficult to simply relinquish them. Therefore, if one makes correct efforts in the practice of Mahâmudrâ, there is no need to purify the latent tendencies of mistakenness through deliberate effort, but the appearances of mistakenness as well as mistaken thoughts will self-arise and be self-liberated as the nature of phenomena. This is the distinctive key point. Similar to snow s falling on a hot stone, since mistaken thoughts are the display and play of the nature of phenomena, through realizing their nature just as it is, they are liberated right within the basic nature, just as ice melts into water. Similar to there being no cold sensation in a place pervaded by a powerful fire, in yogins who have mastered the true basic nature, it is impossible for isolated appearances of mistakenness or mis­taken thoughts to arise, just as a picture drawn on water. For they and the nature of phenomena can never exist separately. In brief, the adventitious stains to be relinquished need to be understood as the innate clinging to real existence.As for the third line, “May the stainless dharmakàya manifest as the re­sult of the purification,” the primordially present dharmakàya free from stains exists intrinsically in the mind streams of all sentient beings, but due to not recognizing their very own essence, they wander in delusion. In brief, if they recognize their very own wisdom that is present already at the time of the ground, just that is sufficient. In Dzogchen it is said that looking out over there is samsàra, while looking back in here is nirvàna. There­fore, the boundary line between mistakenness and liberation comes down to not seizing or seizing minds own ground: not seizing its ground means to be under the extrinsic influence of mistaken thoughts, while seizing its ground refers to withdrawing thoughts back in and then resting within the nature of self-awareness without contrivance and alteration. Hence, apart from the difference of these two states, the intrinsic qualities abide in both buddhas and sentient beings without any difference. No matter how much sentient beings are afflicted, the qualities that are their own essence do not become worse. No matter how much the noble ones relinquish the stains through the remedies of the path, the qualities that are their own essence cannot be made better. If one is able to fully manifest such qualities that are"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"238 Translator s Introductionfree from being better, being worse, contrivance, alteration, increase, and decrease, that is pointed out to be “the attainment of the result.”On verse 14, Sangyé Nyenpa Rinpoche comments as follows:Appearance is mind and being empty is mind.Realization is mind and mistakenness is your own mind.Arising is mind and ceasing is mind.Therefore, cut through all superimpositions in the mind.886In the common Madhyamaka system, the word “appearance” eliminates the extreme of existence, while “being empty” eliminates the extreme of nonexistence. Through the word “appearance,” we can understand that what is not established ultimately and is like rainbows and mirages is mere lucidity and mere awareness but is not really established. Phenomena that are established ultimately cannot be properly indicated by what is understood by “appearance,” just as common expressions such as “it appears to exist” and “it appears to be understood” indicate a lack of definite certainty. Thus, ultimately established phenomena must be expressed by “being established” and not by “appearance.” “Appearance” means that, no matter which pure and impure phenomena of samsara and nirvana may appear, they are not established as anything that is ultimately different from what appears as the display of our present mind as such. The manner of “being empty” must be expressed by there being a basis of being empty, otherwise the meaning of being empty does not apply, as in the cases of the horns of a rabbit, a sky-flower, and so on. Therefore, “being empty” eliminates the extreme of nonexistence. As for the basis of emptiness, all seeming phenomena that consist of form up through omniscience are empty of a nature of their own. Apart from differences in terms of being pure and impure from the perspective of minds seeing, as far as those phenomena themselves go, the manner of being empty of a nature of their own is the same for all of them. Therefore, when speaking of “being empty,” superimpositions must be well cut through based on the basis of emptiness that is the mind, whereas it is difficult to cut through superimpositions based on merely the objects of the mind. Thus, it is based on the mind that one needs to be certain about the manner of being empty. The meaning of being empty here is that native connate wisdom is empty of the adventitious stains of latent tendencies, whereas just the explanation of the manner of being empty of a nature of its own as found in the Rangtong approach makes no sense here.887 In brief, the manner of appearing (seeming phenomena) and the manner of being"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahàmudrà 239empty (ultimate phenomena) are both not different from the mind. Here, “mind” should not be understood as our ordinary impure mind but as the pure mind as such that is the basic nature.“Realization is mind” refers to realizing this basic nature. This is not to be understood as newly realizing something that did not exist before, but it means to recognize the basic nature that exists in us in an intrinsic man­ner.888 When thinking about this in terms of the naturally abiding disposi­tion, all sentient beings are buddhas—there is no sentient being that does not have the buddha disposition. As Uttaratantra 1.28 says:Since the perfect buddhakâya radiates,Since suchness is undifferentiable,And because of the disposition,All beings always possess the buddha heart.Thus, it is established that the naturally abiding disposition exists in the mind streams of all beings. Even in the Rangtong system, the naturally abiding disposition—explained as the emptiness of being empty of real existence—is established as existent by pervading all sentient beings. In the systems of Shentong and the heart of Mahamudra, the naturally abiding disposition is explained as the nature of the mind—the basic nature whose essence is empty and whose nature is lucid—which exists within the cocoon of the adventitious stains. All buddha qualities of freedom and maturation exist in the mind streams of sentient beings, and when they become manifest through having practiced properly at the time of the path, that is called “realizing the basic nature.” This is not the same as the view of the Sàmkhyas and so on because the Lahkavatdrasutra clearly says so and adduces the reason that tathdgatagarbha is emptiness. Also the Rangtong masters, such as Candraklrti, did not say that the tathagata heart does not exist in the mind streams of sentient beings, but they said that it exists. Nevertheless, in the context of rebutting flaws such as the above, one needs to know this distinctive feature of tathdgatagarbha's being emptiness. If this tathagata heart—the pure mind—did not exist at all, the progression of mistakenness and realization would not exist either. Here, the commentary again quotes the above-mentioned verse 11 of the Dharmadhdtustava, which is followed by Uttaratantra 1.40:If the buddha element did not exist,There would be no weariness of suffering,"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"240 Translators IntroductionNor would there be the wish, striving,And aspiration for nirvana.On the correct understanding of superior insight in Mahâmudrâ (verse 17), our text says that it means to clearly see, just as it is, the actual way of being of the luminous nature of the mind as explained in the context of Madhyamaka Shentong,889 whose nature is permanent, everlasting, peaceful, and eternal.890 In the common pàramitàyàna, superior insight refers to resting in meditative equipoise within the actual way of being of identitylessness empty of the two kinds of identities, which is also called “the view of the followers of Rangtong.” According to the system of Great Shentong, Uttaratantra 1.63 and 1.84 say:The luminous nature of the mind Is completely unchanging, just like space.It is not afflicted by adventitious stains,Such as desire, born from false imagination.Since it is the dharmakàya, the Tathàgata,The reality of the noble ones, and the ultimate nirvàna,There is no nirvâna apart from buddhahoodDue to its qualities being inseparable, just like the sun and its rays.Since the very beginning, the mind streams of all sentient beings possess this actual way of being of the inseparability of being lucid and being empty in an intrinsic manner. No matter how it may be obscured by adventitious stains, in terms of its nature, it is never tainted by stains, while the stains exist in the manner of being separable from it. This mind that is the inseparability of being lucid and being empty has the nature of being permanent and being free from change, decrease, and increase. It is ever undeceiving, changeless, and genuinely stable. Throughout all three phases of ground, path, and fruition, it is this nature of the mind that is certain to be solely the object of the genuine meditative equipoise within the qualities that are the nature of phenomena. This is what needs to be manifested through the practice of superior insight. What is to be manifested in this way is not something newly arisen, but it is the connate qualities’ primordially existing in the mind streams of beings in an intrinsic manner that is suitable to be manifested."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 241This is not to be understood as the mere emptiness that is taught in the context of Rangtong, which is known as “dead emptiness” (Tib. bem stong). In the middle turning of the wheel of dharma, it is taught that all phe­nomena from form up through omniscience are empty of a nature of their own in order to put an end to clinging to their real existence. However, as Dharmadhatustava 22 says:The sutras that teach emptiness,However many spoken by the victors,They all remove afflictions,But never ruin this dhatu.The realization of mind s true nature needs to be preceded by understanding the Rangtong view not only for the sake of relinquishing the wrong idea of, or the clinging to, the real existence of what does not exist ultimately, but also in order that the correct view and meditation of Great Shentong can arise in ones mind stream. It is definite that to the extent that certainty about the Rangtong view has arisen to that same extent the correct and profound view and meditation of Shentong will arise in ones mind stream. This was earnestly established by the great Shentong masters, such as Yumowa Mikyo Dorje, Dolpopa, and Sakya Chogden. Therefore, though there is the ascertainment by applying the manner of negating what is to be negated to each and every instant of phenomena from form up through omniscience, the basic element as the remainder after such negations is not affected by them. That is, the basic nature of the inseparability of being lucid and being empty is taught to be established by its very nature. Uttaratantra I.63ab says that this basic nature—the final way of being—is really established:The luminous nature of the mind Is completely unchanging, just like space.To dismantle the mind of dualistic clinging, it is taught not only that form and so on are empty of a nature of their own but that omniscience too is not established. The Buddha said that even if there were a phenomenon superior to the supreme phenomenon of nirvana, it is also to be regarded as illusion-like and dreamlike. Accordingly, the basic nature is taught from the side of negation in Nagarjunas collection of reasoning. The reason for this is that if one does not completely put an end to all forms of clinging to extremes, it is impossible for the realization of the basic nature to arise."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"242 Translators IntroductionThus, one needs to put an end to all mistaken cognitions with regard to the objects of clinging. If one were to prove that omniscience and luminosity are established by their very nature while still being in the context of putting an end to dualistic clinging, this would yet again represent the great demon of clinging to real existence. Therefore, in addition to not being able to overcome dualistic clinging, there would be the danger of not conquering the clinging to real existence. This is similar to someone’s fear of there being a snake in the house, which can be dispelled through another person’s assuring the first one that there is in fact no snake. However, such fear cannot be relinquished through saying, “It is not certain whether there is or is not a snake.”Thus, since it is necessary to put an end to all forms of clinging to ex­tremes without exception in order to complete the analysis of the view, all phenomena from form up through omniscience must be established as lacking real existence. Once all such forms of mistaken clinging to the ul­timate have been dismantled, within the perspective of the correct med­itative state of ascertaining the ultimate just as it is, the special certainty about the basic nature of nondual lucidity and emptiness’s being estab­lished by the very nature of being beyond all extremes will arise—this is the inconceivable power of the nature of phenomena. One will understand this when reading the Mahabherisutra, Mahameghasutra, greater and lesser Mahaparinirvanasutra, and others—one’s fear of permanence, eternity, and changelessness will subside on its own. The Buddha said in these sutras that the basic nature has the nature of being permanent, eternal, and changeless, while those who say that the basic nature is not permanent, not eternal, and not changeless do not see it. Since one needs to eliminate all wrong ideas of clinging to extremes in the context of cutting through superimpositions by way of the correct view, the views explained in the Rangtong approach are indispensable—they directly and indirectly open the door to the correct arising of certainty about the basic nature. The actual basic nature without mistakenness is very clearly taught in all sutras and tantras and, in particu­lar, in the wisdom chapter of the nondual Kalacakratantra. Hence, it is very inappropriate if that basic nature is presented as the mere emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation. On the other hand, having trained in detail in the distinction between the temporary and the ultimate definitive meanings as well as in their presentations, one’s insight will be unflustered without falling into any bias.On verse 21, the commentary says that ordinary mind—mind’s basic na­ture of its lucidity and emptiness being inseparable—is what is left behind"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ 243as the remainder after experiences of clinging to both good as well as bad thoughts have become pure within the expanse.891 As Uttaratantra I.63ab, I.155cd, and I.30ab say:The luminous nature of the mind Is completely unchanging, just like space.It is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.It is always unafflicted by nature,Just as a pure jewel, space, and water.This ordinary mind is beyond relinquishing and adopting as well as beyond being separated and being attained. As Uttaratantra 1.154 and the prajnàpàramità texts (.Abhisamayàlamkàra V.21) say:There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.Thus, no matter how much it may come under the sway of afflictions or how much the qualities may seem to improve, ordinary mind cannot become worse or better. It is this ordinary mind empty of all reference points (such as coming and going, good and bad, and relinquishment and attainment) that is called “freedom from reference points.”Go Lotsdwa’s Unique Mahâmudrâ Interpretation of the UttaratantraGo Lotsàwas commentary on the Uttaratantra is unique among all com­mentaries on that text in that it relates the Uttaratantra to Mahâmudrâ in an explicit, repeated, and detailed manner. Examples of this commen­tary’s linking the Uttaratantra to Mahâmudrâ in a general way include its opening homages being addressed not only to Maitreya, but also to the prominent Mahâmudrâ figures Maitripa (who is also the one who found the Uttaratantra), Dampa Sangyé, and Gampopa. The colophon of Go Lotsàwas text makes it clear that it explains the Uttaratantra based on (1) the exegetical tradition of Ngog Lotsàwa, (2) Gampopa s Mahâmudrâ inter­pretation of the Uttaratantra, which he received through Jigden Surngon,"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"244 Translators Introductionand (3) the explanations coming from Sajjanas direct student Dsen Ka- woché, as well as the meaning of the three dharma wheels, both of which are in accordance with Mahâmudrà.892 In addition, Go Lotsawa discusses the Lankàvatârasütra as a general source of Mahamudra instructions, usu­ally matching it with Mahamudra teachings from the dohâ tradition or early Kagyii masters.893Having thus clearly stated his general thrust of interpreting the Ut­taratantra in the framework of Mahamudra, Go Lotsawa more specifically explains that the Mahamudra approach of meditation on the nature of the mind as presented in Maitrlpa s Tattvadašaka and its commentary by Sahajavajra corresponds to both the Uttaratantra and R G W .894 Later, he also describes several times in detail how Maitrlpa s approach is superior to Madhyamaka analytical meditation as, for example, taught by Kamalaslla.895Even more specifically, Go Lotsawa describes how the four yogas of Mahamudra are contained in a hidden form in both the Lankàvatârasütra and the Uttaratantra.896 He states that the gurus who experience the pith instructions of the Uttaratantra explain the progressive stages of famil­iarizing with the tathagata heart as these four yogas of Mahamudra. He admits that he cannot say for certain that the conventional names of these four yogas are not found anywhere in the scriptures, only that he himself has not seen them. However, he says, their meanings are explained in the Lankàvatârasütra. Though there are many presentations of the four yogas of Mahamudra composed by different gurus, here is what Lama Shang says in his Ultimate Profound Path of Mahamudra:The meditative equipoise of realizing your own mind Is understood through the progression of the four yogas.At the time when the yoga of one-pointedness arises,You realize the nature of your own mind.Like the center of pure space,It is unceasing clarity emptiness without middle or end.To remain in a vibrant and crisp state Is the meditative equipoise of the first yoga.Thoughts’ proliferating out of this [state] representsIts subsequent attainment, even if you meditate on your cushion.If vibrant and crisp clarity emptiness remains,Even if you are chatting, walking, or sitting,You remain in the state of meditative equipoise."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and MahamudraAt the time when the yoga of freedom from reference points arises, You realize the essence of your own mind.Uninterrupted awareness free from reference points,Without arising, ceasing, adopting, or rejecting—This mind of yours that abides as the dharmakaya Is the meditative equipoise of the second yoga.If you remain in this meditative equipoise,Even if you are walking, chatting, and speaking,You remain in the state of meditative equipoise.If you become distracted by characteristics of reference points,You are [in the phase] that is attained subsequent [to this equipoise], even if you meditate on your cushion.At the time when the yoga of one taste arises,You realize the characteristic of your own mind.You realize that the many [appearances] of samsara and nirvana Arise from your own mind, the dharmakaya free from reference points.Thought and nonthought,Appearance and nonappearance, abiding And nonabiding, empty and nonempty,Clarity and unclarity—this entire variety Is of one taste as the luminous dharmakaya.Therefore, you see the great light of the dharmakaya But you see no thoughts that are not luminosity.The time of mind’s taking holdOf such a realization of equal tasteIs the meditative equipoise of the third yoga.If you are embraced by native mind,Even if you are jumping, running, chatting, and speaking,You remain in the state of meditative equipoise.If you are separated from native mind,You are [in the phase] that is attained subsequent [to this equipoise], even if you meditate on your cushion.At the time when the yoga of nonmeditation arises,The essence of awareness is free from any support.There is nothing to meditate for a yogin,Nor is there any meditator, who simply disappeared."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"246 Translators IntroductionThis is called “buddhahood endowed with the three kàyas And five wisdoms being complete in yourself’—Now you know that it is exactly this.You clearly resolved that precisely this Is the siddhi of Mahâmudrâ.There is no conceited mind thinking that This primordially abiding siddhi was attained.There is no being embraced or not being embraced by mindfulness,No mental engagement or nonengagement,And no being or not being of one taste.In nondual perception’s very own state,There are no stages of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment.In uninterrupted awareness emptiness,There is no death and no birth.The power of a garuda is complete within its eggshell—Once it is free from its eggshell, it soars through the sky.The qualities of the three kàyas are complete in the mind—Once the trap of the body has fallen apart,897 the welfare of others dawns.In such an occurrence of nonmeditation,There are no stages of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment.No matter how high your realization may be,As long as there is something to become familiar with,There is the duality of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment,There is being embraced and not being embraced by mindfulness,And there is the duality of being distracted and not being distracted. Once it dawns that there is nothing to become familiar with,This is what is called “nonmeditation.”898Then, GC links this description of the four yogas of Mahâmudrâ to a passage from the Lahkâvatârasütra in which the Buddha answers Mahàmati’s question on “the great yoga.”899 Here, the Buddha explains that bodhisattvas who possess the following four dharmas are yogins of the great y o g a- ascertaining that appearances are one’s own mind, relinquishing the views of arising, abiding, and ceasing, realizing that outer entities are nonentities,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 247and wishing to attain the personally experienced wisdom of the noble ones. Go Lotsawas comments on this passage from the Lahkdvatarasutra match those four dharmas with the four yogas of Mahamudra in due order.Thus, according to Go Lotsawa, the first Mahamudra yoga of one-point- edness has five distinctive features. (1) Meditating that everything is mere mind consists of the samadhi of realizing that clarity emptiness is like space. One realizes that everything that appears as the three realms of samsara appears as the nature of this clarity emptiness. It is just that much that wanders in samsara—other than this mind of clarity emptiness, there is no self or “mine” of someone who passes from this life to the next. (2) As for nothing to adopt or to reject, one thinks that the abiding in this clarity emptiness and the movement of thoughts are not different types of substance. Since it is this very clarity emptiness that moves as thoughts, there is no need for any adopting of clarity or rejecting of thoughts. (3) Being tainted by latent tendencies of discursiveness means to know that these latent tendencies have not yet been relinquished when thoughts oc­cur again despite having seen them as clarity emptiness. (4) Connection means to know that when mind experiences objects while not in meditative equipoise, that experiencer is also nothing but clarity emptiness. (5) Con­cordance means that all appearances of bodies, possessions, places, and the beings of the six realms are connected with this mind in terms of having the same nature. In brief, it is said in many ways that all arising thoughts are understood as having the nature of nonthought. This is exactly the same as the sutras and treatises explaining that one understands mere mind through determining that the connection between words and referents is imaginary. According to Gotsangpa, this yoga corresponds to the paths of accumulation and preparation.In the yoga of freedom from reference points, all entities are like ap­pearances in illusions and dreams—though they appear to arise, they lack arising. If their nature is not established as themselves, something other, or both, they simply do not arise. Thus they are realized to be without basis or root. This realization expands in the form of five distinctive features.(1) Through seeing that appearances are in concordance with mind, one realizes that all appearances come down to mind—when the mind is happy or suffering, appearances arise in corresponding ways. (2) Through seeing that mind lacks a nature of its own and seeing that appearances are minds gateways of appearing, one realizes that appearances also lack a nature of their own. (3) By virtue of this realization, the sense faculties revert to the inside and thus the five sense consciousnesses do not engage their objects."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"248 Translators Introduction(4) One sees that the eleven conditions for the arising of consciousness (the five sense faculties, their objects, and imperceptible forms) are mere imagination but also lack any nature. (5) Through the expansion of seeing that ones own inner and outer skandhas lack a nature, one realizes that the entirety of the three realms of samsára is produced by the condition that is ones own imagination. According to Gótsangpa, this yoga corresponds to the first bhümi.As for the yoga of one taste, all entities that consist of mind and objects are merely delusive appearances because they are like mirages, dreams, and seeing falling hairs in an eye disease. There is no need to dam the water of a mirage, take care of the child in a dream, or tie those falling hairs into a knot. Likewise, when one sees the nature of the mind, there is no need for any effort of regarding appearances as its opposite. Therefore, everything that appears as an entity is nothing but this very mind as such that lacks a nature of its own. Through realizing this, one realizes that appearances and the nature of phenomena are of one taste. Therefore, there is nothing to be relinquished or to be adopted. You may wonder, “If that is the case, what are these phenomena that appear in distinct forms while having no nature of their own?” They appear due to the power of the beginningless “impregnations of the negative tendencies of discursiveness.” This term means that conceptions are discursiveness, while their latent tendencies are impregnations of negative tendencies. All the many kinds of appearances that arise from these latent tendencies are also called “latent tendencies” by virtue of labeling the result with the name of its cause. Conceptions of clinging to all kinds of appearances arise, and further appearances sim­ilar to them rearise later from the latent tendencies that were planted by them. Thus, this mechanism of alternating conceptions and latent tenden­cies has no beginning in time. However, the ultimate foundation of such latent tendencies is naturally luminous mind. It is because one realizes that mind and appearances are of one taste in such a way that this yoga is called “one taste.” According to Gótsangpa, this yoga corresponds to the second through seventh bhümis.The yoga of nonmeditation refers to personally experienced wisdom, which does not depend on any ordinary perceptual or inferential valid cognitions, or on any trustworthy scriptures. Therefore, without relying on any valid cognitions of any person whatsoever, yogins are individually self-aware all on their own, which is why this is referred to as “personally experienced realization.” This personally experienced wisdom is called “nonmeditation” because “meditation” is a name for the efforts of wishing"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 249to meditate and the thoughts about characteristics of meditation, while these do not exist here. On the eighth bhumi (to which this yoga of non­meditation is said to correspond), the final poised readiness for the dharma of nonarising is accomplished.900 Through this poised readiness, the five sense consciousnesses together with the alaya-consciousness, the afflicted mind, and the conceptual mind undergo their fundamental change. From among the five dharmas, names, causal features, and imagination also un­dergo their fundamental change. Likewise, the three natures and the two kinds of identitylessness are superbly realized here. By contrast, on the seventh bhumi and below, the imaginary nature does not come to an end because the appearances of the conceptual mind have not come to an end. Nor does the dependent nature come to an end because the conceptual mind itself has not come to an end. Also, up through the seventh bhumi, the latent tendencies of conceiving of the two kinds of identities are not entirely relinquished. On the eighth bhumi, however, all of these come to an end and therefore this is the culminating realization of the three natures and the two kinds of identitylessness.Furthermore, GC s section on the four steps of correct yogic practice as the third point in the explanation of nonconceptual wisdom in the Dharma- dharmatavibhaga equates these steps not only with Lahkavatarasutra X.256-57, Mahdydnasutralamkdra VI.8, and Madhyantavibhaga I.6-7ab,901 but it also matches them with the four yogas of Mahamudra:You may wonder, “Such is certainly the case, but if one holds that this text of the Bhagavan Maitreya is also a text of what is known as the yogas of Mahamudra, do the four yogas of this [Mahamudra] fit with those [four yogic practices in the Dharmadharmatdvibhaga]Vy They do fit very well. (1) The first [yoga] is to look inside and then to focus on [everything’s being] ones own mind. (2) As for the explanation [in] the second [yogic practice] that there is nothing external, it is the [yoga of] freedom from reference points in which one realizes that all phe­nomena that are objects of the mind lack any basis or root. (3) The realization that both what appears as [if] external and the inner mind free from reference points are of one taste is the yogic practice of the nonobservation of observation. (4) To not meditate through deliber­ately focusing on even the nonduality of subject and object is called “nonmeditation,” which is the fourth yoga.902"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"250 Translators IntroductionSince GC considers the Dharmadharmatdvibhaga as being a commen­tary on the fifth vajra point of the Uttaratantra, by implication, the con­nection between the Dharmadharmatdvibhaga and Mahamudra obviously applies to the Uttaratantra too.903Thus, Go Lotsawa establishes the connection between Mahamudra, the Lahkavatarasutra, and in fact all five Maitreya texts through the frame­work of the four yogic practices. For, besides the above-stated connections with the Uttaratantra, the Mahdyanasutralamkara, the Madhyantavibhdga, and the Dharmadharmatdvibhaga, it is well known that the four levels of the path of preparation are discussed in many Yogacara texts in terms of the corresponding contents of the four yogic practices. In the Abhisa­maydlamkdra in particular, the four levels of the path of preparation are called “the four factors conducive to penetration.” Taking this into account, GC consequently also matches the four yogas of Mahamudra with these four factors as they are explained in the Abhisamaydlamkdra:904I regard it also as suitable to match the four factors conducive to pen­etration with the four yogas for the following reasons. (1) On the level of heat [of the path of preparation] in the Abhisamaydlamkdra, [line I.28b] speaks of “being inexpressible,”905 and it is seen in the phase [of the yoga] of one-pointedness that thoughts are not as things truly are.(2) It is taught that, through the expansion of prajna in the phase [of the yoga] of freedom from reference points, everything internal and external is seen to be empty and [Abhisamaydlamkdra I.30cd] says on the level of peak:Prajna investigatesIn terms of all being unobservable.906(3) The realization in the phase [of the yoga] of one taste that un­born mind and the appearances of mind are of equal taste matches the explanation of [Abhisamaydlamkdra 1.3lab] on the level of poised readiness:Form and so on are without nature,Their nature being their nonbeing.907(4) “Nonmeditation” is called such because there are no thoughts of wishing to meditate, and such a meditation is the supreme one. This"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahámudrá 251matches what [Abhisamayalamkara I.33b] says on the level of the su­preme dharma:And the nonconceptuality of samádhi.908In this context, it is noteworthy that the Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhisamayalamkara also explains some of the contents of this text in relation to Mahámudrá and frequently equates Mahàmudrà with prajňápáramitá, suchness, the nature of phenomena, the tathágata heart, and so on.909Finally, we find another reference to the four yogas of Mahámudrá ac­cording to Padampa Sangyé in GCs comments on Uttaratantra 1.31:By virtue of its essential nature of power,Being unchanging, and being moist,It resembles the qualitiesOf a precious gem, space, and water.910GC declares that suchness is not a nonimplicative negation but a phenomenon of basic awareness. Therefore, it is endowed with both power and compassion (exemplified by moisture). Also, the dharmakáya and the disposition are merely divisions of nothing but unchanging suchness in terms of its being pure and impure, respectively. Furthermore, the dharmakáya realizes unconditioned suchness and is also endowed with compassion. If suchness is directly realized, consummate power (such as the supernatural knowledges) and compassion arise naturally. Likewise, the disposition is endowed with the dharmakáya since it primordially possesses the qualities such as the ten powers, and it never changes or deteriorates, even when wandering through all kinds of higher and lower realms. On the path, it is through the power of aspiring for the profound buddhadharmas that suchness will be realized, and by virtue of that, compassion for all beings who do not realize it arises. This also shows the progression of the four yogas of Mahámudrá. As the Mahâyànasütràlamkàra says:When murky water becomes clear,[Its] transparency does not arise from elsewhere,But is just its becoming free from pollution.The same goes for the purity of your own mind.911"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"252 Translators IntroductionAccordingly, through the yoga of one-pointedness, bodhisattvas settle the mind unmoved by thoughts, like clear water. Through this, they realize space-like suchness free from reference points. By virtue of that, through the yoga of one taste, they realize the suchness of the aspects of what is outwardly oriented (the eyes and so on) as being pure. Finally, when the jewellike yoga of nonmeditation free from effort arises in them, through their meditation’s being directing toward taking care of beings, their compassion arises effortlessly and thus the welfare of others is accomplished naturally. This, Gô Lotsâwa says, is what Padampa Sangyé holds.GC’s comments on RGVV’s introduction to Uttaratantra 1.153 further­more describe the four yogas by teaching the manner in which the basic element as it is taught in this passage of RGVV is to be made a living expe­rience through meditation.912 Though the basic element is explained in the text as the three natures of the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition, when one makes it a living experience, these three are to be practiced as one. What is to be known or viewed in this context is simply the tathagata heart that has the three distinctive features of being as vast as the dhar­makaya, being undifferentiable from suchness, and being the disposition that is certain with regard to buddhahood. More specifically, (1) that this basic element has the nature of basic awareness means that it lacks any difference of being close to some knowable objects and being distant from some others. Since it has neither middle nor end, the basic awareness of the tathagata heart is just as vast as the fruitional dharmakàya’s pervading all realms and sentient beings. (2) That it is not established as any character­istics of reference points whatsoever means that it has the characteristic of being undifferentiable from, and being of one taste with, all phenomena.(3) Finally, it has the nature of being the disposition of being certain as the dharmakaya in the end. This basic element is to be viewed as existing in all sentient beings—existing as changeless suchness because it exists at all times, having the nature of vastness because it exists in all beings without difference, and existing as the nature of the disposition of being certain as the dharmakaya at the end because it exists in the support that is the mind.Then, GC explains the first three yogas of Mahamudra by matching them with these three distinctive features, that is, Mahamudra yogins real­ize these three in a progressive manner as follows. (1) Through the yoga of great one-pointedness, they see the vastness of the basic element because they see that their own mind is without middle or end, just like space. (2) When they, through the yoga of freedom from reference points, realize the identitylessness of all phenomena exactly as it is, they realize that it is not"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 253the case that something that was not empty before has become empty later but that the basic ground is like that from the very beginning and that even buddhahood does not represent a change from this basic ground. There­fore, they see that suchness is undifferentiable. (3) By virtue of realizing through the yoga of one taste that appearance and emptiness are of one taste, they know that the minds of all sentient beings are just like their own minds and also see that the minds of sentient beings and the dharmakayas of buddhas are very much alike. Therefore, they see the tathagata heart as having the nature of the disposition of being certain as the dharmakaya at the end. In due order, these three yogas correspond to the first three lines of Maháyánasütrálamkára IV.8:The mind is aware that nothing other than mind exists.Then it is realized that mind does not exist either.The intelligent ones are aware that both do not existAnd abide in the dharmadhátu, in which these are absent.It is indeed realized from the time of the yoga of freedom from reference points onward that mind is primordially unborn. However, the mind to be meditated on and the mind that meditates on it still appear as if they were different. By contrast, when the aspects of subject and object are directly perceived as not being two, just as a self-illuminating lamp, this is expressed by the conventional term “nonmeditation.” This yoga of nonmeditation also has three stages (lesser, middle, and great) by virtue of its being divided in terms of its coarse, middle, and subtle factors to be relinquished. That Maitrlpa described it as being without stages is not because he had in mind that it has no such division as just described but because he had in mind that these are all of one taste as the taste of emptiness.In addition to speaking about all four yogas of Mahamudra, GC also men­tions the first three yogas of Mahamudra in the context of the superiority of the third dharma wheels approach to meditation, which corresponds to Mahamudra pith instructions.913 For example, when one looks at the stream of a river from afar, it looks as if it were unmoving like a stick, but when one comes close, one sees this river as nothing but a sequence of earlier and later waves. Likewise, when mind, external objects, and their differences in terms of time are examined well through the direct perception that arises from the yoga of one-pointedness, one realizes that one cannot observe any nature of entities whatsoever. This is the manner of realizing the lack of arising in a direct manner. (As is clear from descriptions of the second"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"254 Translators IntroductionMahamudra yoga of freedom from reference points elsewhere in GC, what happens during this yoga is precisely that realization of not observing any nature of entities.) The continuum of this direct perception puts an end to thoughts that blend terms and their referents. When these have ceased, as a result, all mistaken appearances cease. This is explained by the for­mer masters as “appearances having dissolved into mind.” When one does analytical meditation based on inference, it is not that a direct perception of true reality arises immediately after said thoughts have ceased. Rather, once thoughts have vanished, a mere nonconceptual perception arises, and it is from that perception that the direct perception of true reality arises. However, these two direct perceptions differ only in being far and close, respectively. This progression is also stated in the Mahdydnasutralamkara:You should investigate and discriminateContinuously through mental discourses.914You should also analyze through mental engagementsThat are without [mental] discourse and of one taste.915GC also directly relates the first two yogas of Mahamudra to lines I.13ab of the Uttaratantra.916 First, Go Lotsawa has someone ask, “Madhyamikas first determine emptiness through inference and then familiarize with it in meditation, which is like a fire that arose from rubbing two sticks burning these sticks. Is the realization of the emptiness that is basic awareness in the third dharma wheel something that arises suddenly in a direct manner or is there a valid cognition of searching for it?” In the system of the pith instructions, to some, this emptiness is taught by having them first engage in the preliminary of investigating what their mind is like throughout day and night. Some others are instructed as follows, “Give up any mental engagement in the three times and settle your mind in an immovable manner. Through this, what is called ‘one-pointedness’ will arise, which has the characteristic of direct perception. Once that has arisen, look at the mind that meditates in the manner of this direct perception’s being turned inward.” Thus, they are made to engage in nothing but such looking, just as when one examines whether there are animals in a body of water and then just looks by energetically focusing ones eyes. This is the approach of searching through nonconceptual direct perception. From it, the direct seeing that all phenomena are identityless will arise. In the above example, the eye sense faculty that looks at the water stands for devotion to a guru who sees reality, while the consciousness that arises from that eye represents the"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 255direct perception that is turned inward. This approach of the Mahamudra yoga of one-pointedness is taught in Uttaratantra I.13a:Because they see that, by virtue of the natural luminosity of the mind,the afflictions are without nature.Uttaratantra 1.13b teaches the direct realization of identitylessness, which is given the name “the yoga of freedom from reference points”:They perfectly realize that the endpoint of the identitylessness of allbeings is peace.This freedom from reference points is not just a nonimplicative negation but the dharma of basic awareness that is not established as any character­istics whatsoever. The finger of Mahamudra points to the momentary basic awareness that does not fall to either the side of appearance or the side of emptiness. This is what those who are versed in the pith instructions teach. Sahajavajra explains in his Tattvadasakatlka that even though this system belongs to the paramitayana, it is given the name Mahamudra. The same is also explained in Jnanaklrti’s Tattvavatara. Thus, the actual path of libera­tion is the yoga of the Mahamudra of awareness and emptiness, but it is not accomplished through merely meditating on an emptiness that is arrived at through analysis. This is taught in detail by Pamo Trupa and his foremost disciples, for example:Even if you have meditated for eons on a mentally fabricated emptiness,There is no chance for being liberated from the fetters of this golden chain.By drinking a handful of water from the ocean, one will equally know the taste of all the water in the ocean that one has not drunk. Likewise, when yogins know the true reality of their own minds, through the principle of that true reality, they will know the true reality of the minds of all sentient beings down to the Avici hell as well as all seven vajra points up through the dharmakaya of a buddha.

In brief, [this realization] arises from two causes—through seeing that mind is naturally luminous and through seeing that its proximate afflictions are primordially terminated and ceased.” The remaining passage “Now, these two [factors] . .. should be understood in detail according to the sütra” is the detailed explanation of these two yogas.A bit further down, GC elaborates on the connection between these two yogas and the superiority of the Mahamudra approach of working with direct perceptions rather than inferential conceptual cognitions.920 GC says that all followers of Buddhist philosophical systems from the Vaibhásikas up through the Mádhyamikas are in accord in their making great efforts in meditating on the lack of a self in order to attain liberation. There are two ways of such meditation. Some eliminate the object—a self—through reasoning and then meditate on identitylessness. Others follow what the Kasyapaparivarta teaches, which favors the second one from among the following two approaches—to first eliminate the object resembles a dogs chasing after a stone thrown toward it, whereas to scrutinize the views about a self through a nonconceptual state of mind of direct perception is like a lion’s chasing the one who throws the stone. The followers of Mahamudra use this second approach. Thus, when a thought of viewing a self has arisen, without giving rise to any subsequent thoughts of trying to relinquish that first thought or analyzing it through reasoning, they merely look at that thought of viewing a self with the previously attained state of mind of the yoga of one-pointedness. Nevertheless, for those who do not have faith in this approach and also do not have the mental power for it, the meditation that is based on inferences that analyze for the lack of a self is an excellent path.921"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahámudrá 257In brief, GC states,922 the remedy that prevents such views about a self from arising again later must be something that entails valid cognition be­cause the Pramánavárttika says:Whoever among them has valid cognitionWill invalidate the other one.923In that regard, the followers of Mahámudrá operate with nothing but perceptual valid cognitions, while others work with inferential valid cognitions.Just as for the above meditation on personal identitylessness, with re­gard to meditating on phenomenal identitylessness, GC makes the same distinction of two approaches depending on peoples different capacities.924 The first one is to give rise to the prajňá of realizing that phenomena lack a nature of their own, which arises from valid cognition as a remedy for thinking that inner and outer phenomena have a nature of their own. The second one is to see that the root of the three realms of samsára—thinking that entities have a nature of their own and clinging to characteristics— arises from mere mental appearances and then to familiarize with pure ap­pearances through the Mahámudrá yoga of self-awareness. Through that, in the manner of the results coming to an end by virtue of the causes hav­ing come to an end, the clinging to all phenomena as being real entities will not arise anymore. In this regard, GC says, the Laňkávatárasňtra says many times that the mental appearances of ones own mind stream are pure, and the stages of meditation consist of the five steps of the completion stage practice of the Guhyasamájatantra (physical isolation, mental isolation, self-blessing, luminosity without appearance, and union), which are also found in the Laňkávatárasňtra.925In the context of discussing the reality of the path, GC identifies a bodhi- sattvas nonconceptual wisdom on the paths of seeing and familiarization as the nature of the path.926 After outlining the Dharmadharmatávibhágas list of five distinctive features that are excluded from being nonconceptual wisdom,927 its nature is identified as being the direct perception that is free from conceptions that entail terms and referents. The reason for calling it “nonconceptuar is that it serves as the remedy for the conceptions of cling­ing to the four characteristics of antagonistic factors, the remedy, suchness, and the dharmas of realization. Then, GC summarizes the discussion on the relinquishment of these characteristics by again referring to the two approaches of Kamalaslla and Maitrlpa, with the latter s being said to be the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"258 Translators Introductionsuperior one to be followed in the context of the Dharmadharmatavibhaga and thus also the Uttaratantra:What is discussed in the Dharmadharmatavibhaga in this way is the pre­sentation of the meaning of the Avikalpapravesafdharani]. When en­gaging in the meaning of this sutra, there appear to be two approaches. Master Kamalaslla holds that the conceptions to be relinquished are relinquished through discriminating prajna alone. The commentary on Maitrlpas Tattvadasaka maintains that [those conceptions] are not re­linquished through discriminating [prajna], but through the samadhi of reality as it is, which is to know that the nature of the [conceptions] to be relinquished is luminosity. Here it is reasonable to follow Mai- trlpa who has found this text.928As a further support for Maitrlpas and Gampopas sutra-based Maha­mudra approach’s being an authentic path on which even ordinary beings can directly realize mind’s true nature, GC then points out that, contrary to the regular sutra approach but according to the Vairocanabhisambodhitan- tra, it is possible to directly see the nature of phenomena even during the phase of “engagement through aspiration,”929 that is, prior to the path of seeing.930 Thus, this tantra says, the realization of the nature of phenomena on the first bhumi refers to its arising as self-aware direct perception.However, according to Go Lotsawa, for ordinary beings, such direct re­alizations of mind’s true nature are possible only through relying on the principle of the nature of phenomena931 as it comes to life in one’s own mind through devotion to a guru. Go Lotsawa quotes R G W s introduction to Uttaratantra 1.153 (which says that the tathagata heart can be realized only through confidence) as an indication of the necessity for that principle also in the context of the sutra-based approach of Mahamudra:Now, [the fact that] the tathagata heart, which is as vast as the dhar­makaya, has the characteristic of not being different from suchness, and has the nature of being the disposition that is certain [with regard to buddhahood], exists at all times and everywhere in a manner that is without difference is to be considered in terms of taking [nothing but] the true nature of phenomena as the [supreme] valid authority. As [the Tathagatagarbhasutra] says:"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 259Son of noble family, this is the true nature of phenomena: no matter whether tathâgatas arise or do not arise, these sentient be­ings always have the tathagata heart.932Here, the nature of phenomena is the principle, the method, and the means through which [it is clear that the true state of phenomena] is just such and that it is not otherwise. In all respects, this very nature of phenomena is the resort, and this very nature of phenomena is the principle for the contemplation of the mind and the realization of the mind. It is neither conceivable nor imaginable. It is [only] accessible to faith.933Go Lotsàwa elaborates on this as follows.934 As for the true reality of the mind, a nonconceptual state of mind arises through the dominant condi­tion of devotion to the guru. It is through that very state of minds becom­ing more and more lucid that the nonarising of this mind is realized and that its unceasing or luminous quality is known. If ones eyes cannot see clearly or a lamp is not bright enough, one sees only the coarse outlines of a form. On the other hand, if both eyes and lamp are clear and bright, even the subtle details of that form can be seen. Likewise, since the thoughts that engage in terms and their referents are not clear, they will never be able to directly perceive mind s true reality. On the other hand, the fact that through the lucid true nature (dharmatà) of clear mind, this mind will be realized as nonarising is the true nature of dependent origination. There­fore, the phenomena (dharma) of that lucidity are nothing but this kind of realization of the mind, while the meaning of -ta (in dharmata) is that they do not change into anything other, that is, any aspects of superimposi­tion and denial. Therefore, they are called dharmata. This is not something like the expectation about a reasons proving the existence of fire through smoke on the path of reasoning. Therefore, when meditating on mind’s na­ture, it is the nature of phenomena that is taken as the sole valid authority. In order to give rise to a direct perception of true reality, the direct seeing of the nature of phenomena by a guru is necessary. Also, in order to realize the luminous nature of the mind, one needs to have accumulated merit by relying on a guru.Later, in its actual comments on the above quote from RGVV, GC confirms that the direct perceptions in Mahamudra meditation are not something that arise as a result of having meditated on an inferential un­derstanding of buddha nature, or something that arises suddenly without"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"260 Translators Introductionany cause.935 Rather, these perceptions are based on the principle of the nature of phenomena. Just as it is certain that a person with clear eyesight who looks at some form for an extended period is able to know even its sub­tle features, when yogins look at their mind without distraction, they will realize mind’s true reality. This is what is called “the principle of the nature of phenomena.” Therefore, the tathagata heart that is endowed with the three distinctive features of the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition should be viewed by taking the nature of phenomena as one’s sole valid au­thority. In that vein, the above quote from the Tathdgatagarbhasutra means that the tathagata heart is the nature of phenomena because it does not belong only to the phase of purified phenomena, but all afflicted phenom­ena do not go beyond it either. Therefore, all sentient beings are bearers of the true nature that is the tathagata heart. It is not something that becomes existent or nonexistent by virtue of tathagatas’ arriving or not arriving, re­spectively. As for RGVV s saying above that “the nature of phenomena is the principle, the method, and the means through which [it is clear that the true state of phenomena] is just such and that it is not otherwise,” the tathagata heart is called a “reasonable principle” (yukti) because it is jus­tified that this nature and its bearers definitely are in accordance and are never in discordance. It is a “joining” (yoga) because it causes the bearers of this nature to be joined with it. It is a “means” (upaya) because it will be realized through it. This very nature of phenomena is the principle for the contemplation and the realization of the mind. It is neither conceiv­able through the prajna that arises from studying nor imaginable through the prajna that arises from reflecting. It is only accessible to intense faith, whose cognitive aspect is certainty about its object. As for “intense” here, when mind looks at mind, it is not seen directly from the very beginning. Rather, when mind is looked at through such ascertaining thoughts, this looking eventually becomes free from thoughts in later moments. Even if there is no movement in the mind, this looking is still conceptual for as long as it has not become as clear as a form is to the eye consciousness. And even if this looking is free from thoughts, it represents only calm abiding until the arising of the superior insight of knowing that the appearances of the mind, which manifest to naive beings as if they were external, are not something other than the mind. Once this superior insight has arisen, this means that calm abiding and superior insight are joined. Therefore, it is called “yoga” (Tib. rnal ’byor; literally “being joined with the native state”).In sum, in agreement with the above-mentioned definition of Maitrl- pas sutra-based Mahamudra approach as being prajnaparamita in essence"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 261but also being in accordance with the vajrayana, Go Lotsawa highlights the necessity of two elements of tantric or essence Mahamudra even within the sutra-based approach of Mahamudra—devotion to a guru and direct pointing-out instructions on mind’s true nature’s being understood as the primordial principle of the nature of phenomena.Preceded by quotes from Jnanaklrti’s Tattvavataray the prajnaparamita sutras, and Sahajavajra’s Tattvadasakatika, GC further elaborates on Mai- trlpa’s particular approach to Mahamudra by describing just the first yoga of one-pointedness and linking it with Nagarjuna’s Bodhicittavivarana:Thus, when those who practice according to the pith instructions of Mahamudra that originated from Maitripa rest in nothing whatsoever, free from any mental engagement in the three times, thoughts that dis­tract from that may arise. Then, they look at just what arises, what­ever it may be, without wavering. Such looking is called “examining thoughts as they are.” Through such an [approach], even if all other thoughts have subsided, there is some subtle thought, “The mind med­itates and rests on something on which to meditate.” When they look nakedly at that subtle thought, it will also cease, and a mind will arise that, just like space, is free from middle and end. This is called “the yoga of one-pointedness.” Master Nagarjuna says:To rest in the mind without any focus Has the characteristic of space.The [buddhas] assert that meditation On emptiness is meditation on space.936At that point, [such practitioners] realize that the aspects of the ob­jects of all thoughts that chase after outer objects are delusive, and the [cognizing] subject too melts into the state of this very mind that is like space. Also, when they see a being, they do not see any [false] imagina­tion that serves as the cause of the afflictions or any focal objects of that imagination (such as being permanent and blissful). In this way, they view [the mind] as [described above]. Therefore, such a yoga is what is to be made a living experience.937Go Lotsawa’s comments on the Dharmadharmatavibhaga that are em­bedded in GC are greatly based on the Avikalpapravesadharani and also compare the two different exegetical approaches to that text’s central notion"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"262 Translators Introductionof “mental nonengagement” (as seen above, this text is referred to by Mai- tripa and his students as a sutra source of the Mahamudra of mental non­engagement).938 First, as for Kamalaslla’s analytical approach of mental nonengagement (which is explained as being “the prajna of discriminating true reality,” whose outcome is the state of mental nonengagement), GC offers a digest of Kamalaslla s Avikalpapravesadharanltika on the four types of conceptions. According to GC, this is the approach for people of infe­rior faculties. The second approach, for those of higher faculties, is found in Maitrlpas Tattvadasaka and his student Sahajavajra’s Tattvadasakatika} with the latter s being cited at length by GC. In this nonanalytical approach based on pith instructions, mental nonengagement means that even be­ginners take the approach of directly resting in the natural luminosity of whatever conceptions that appear in the mind, which is nothing other than Mahamudra.The topic of the relationship between analytical meditation and the direct realization of minds luminosity, including the four yogas of Mahamudra in relation to the Uttaratantra and the Lahkavatarasutra, is also discussed at length earlier and later in GC.939 In the present section, GC says that even Kamalaslla in his three Bhavanakramas and his commentary on the Avikalpapravesadharanl declares that at the end of analysis, one rests in nothing but nonconceptuality.940 Likewise, Atisa s Madhyamakopadesa says that once all phenomena have been found to be nonexistent through dis­criminating prajna, this prajna itself ends up being without appearance, lu­minous, and not established as anything whatsoever. Then, mind is without any thought, does not apprehend anything, and has left behind all mindful­ness and mental engagement.941Thus, Go Lotsawa makes it clear several times that contrary to Kamala- slla’s—at least initially—inferential approach to superior insight, in Maitrl- pas approach, direct cognitions of the true nature of ones mind can be experienced, and are used, right from the beginning (once that nature has been pointed out by the guru) and may happen simultaneously with calm abiding. In this way, Maitrlpa s approach of revealing the luminous empti­ness of whatever appears in the mind covers all apprehended characteris­tics or mental factors to be relinquished as well, through which they simply vanish, or rather, are exposed as what they really are, which is the very heart of Mahamudra practice.Somewhat contrary to this approach of enabling ordinary beings to experience direct cognitions of minds true nature, the Uttaratantra and R G W declare that ordinary beings never see the tathagata heart and that"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 263even noble bodhisattvas cannot see it in its entirety.942 Also, in the classi­cal sütrayàna approach, direct perceptions of ultimate reality are said to be possible only from the first bhümi onward; or else they require tantric methods. This highlights the key point mentioned above that though the essence of the sütra-based Mahamudra approach is prajnaparamita, it is not the same as the regular sütra approach but needs to be enhanced by certain tantric elements, such as devotion to a guru and direct pointing-out instructions by that guru in terms of mind’s stillness, movement, and basic awareness.Besides the gradual approach to Mahamudra through the four yogas and their correspondences to various levels on the five paths and ten bhümis as described above, Go Lotsawa also speaks about a number of other ways of matching them with different paths and bhümis as well as the instan­taneous way of realizing Mahamudra.943 He says that, judging by the Vai- rocanàbhisambodhitantrapindârtha, the presentation of the ten bhümis actually corresponds only to the level of engagement through aspiration. Thus, the four yogas of Mahamudra would correspond only to the path of preparation and below, which also follows from matching them with the four yogic practices and the Abhisamayàlamkàras presentation of the four factors conducive to penetration. Furthermore, it is also fine to say that from the eighth bhümi onward, all four yogas of Mahamudra are complete in a single instant.As for the instantaneous realization of Mahamudra, GC quotes Lama Shang s Ultimate Profound Path of Mahamudra, which say s that Mahamudra is realized in one go, while all calculations in terms of paths and bhümis are mistaken and are given only in order to please the ignorant. The special instantaneous realization of Mahamudra happens on the first bhümi, and the process of familiarizing with that realization is the path of familiar­ization. Though suffering does not end completely and the power of all qualities does not arise immediately upon the realization of nonduality, no one would say that this is not the path of seeing. This is similar to the just-risen sun’s not being able to melt ice and to warm up stones; no one would therefore deny that this is the sun. GC backs up Lama Shang’s de­scription further by quoting Candrakîrti s Madhyamakâvatârabhâsya's say­ing that just like the tracks of a bird’s flying in the sky, the bhümis cannot be distinguished and Haribhadras Abhisamayâlamkârâlokas stating that on the path of familiarization, one does not see anything other than what one has already seen on the path of seeing. However, GC concludes, none of these different explanations are contradictory, just as the two explanations"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"2Ó4 Translator's Introductionof bodhisattvas’ first giving rise to bodhicitta as beginners and on the first bhümi are not contradictory.In this vein, GC also addresses the apparent discrepancy between the position of Haribhadra and others that bodhisattvas on the first bhümi see the entirety of the dharmadhátu, which has no parts, and RGVV (J76) say­ing that the tathagata heart is not even seen by bodhisattvas on the tenth bhümi in its entirety (verses 75-76 of the Dharmadhátustava also say that the dharmakáya becomes complete only at the end of the ten bhümis, just like the waxing moon).944 GC says that since Haribhadra explains the dharmadhátu as having the characteristic of the negation that is phenom­enal identitylessness, it is feasible to say that its entirety is seen on the first bhümi. Here, however, the case is different because the dharmakáya of a buddha has a positive nature—it is only the name “dharmadhátu” that is the same. “But here it is also explained that the dharmadhátu—naturally luminous mind—is even seen by bodhisattvas on the first bhümi to abide in all sentient beings, so why is it said that bodhisattvas on the tenth bhümi see it only a little bit?” Just as they see their own tathágata heart directly, bodhisattvas on the first bhümi likewise see directly that the tathágata heart abides in many sentient beings, and they have also gained the certainty that the same is the case for all beings. However, they do not directly see that this is the case for all beings because they do not see all beings directly. To say that bodhisattvas only “see the tathágata heart a little bit” means that, when bodhisattvas first see their tathágata heart, its qualities have not yet un­folded and thus they see only a few small qualities. On the higher bhümis, the qualities of their tathágata heart unfold more and more (this is in line with Lama Shang’s statement above about the just-risen sun), but compared to a buddha, even the qualities on the tenth bhümi are fewer.GC also supports this by referring to the Dasabhümikasütra to the ef­fect that the attainment of the 112 qualities associated with the first bhümi happens only in the lifetime after one has attained the first bhümi.945 In addition, he refers again to Lama Shang’s example of the sun, saying that otherwise it would follow that it would be correct to say that the sun has not risen because the qualities of the just-risen sun are not yet complete. Note that this means that, unlike Dólpopa and others, Gó Lotsáwa does not hold that all buddha qualities exist in a full-blown manner even in sentient be­ings, but that they need to unfold progressively even in bodhisattvas on the bhümis. Consequently, a direct or instantaneous insight into Mahámudrá on the level of an ordinary being does not mean that this being has become a buddha or even a bodhisattva on the bhümis."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 265Still, for the notion of Mahamudra’s being realized in an instantaneous manner in one go, it is crucial to establish that the buddha qualities do exist in sentient beings, even if that is in a subtle form. In its comments on Uttaratantra 1.35-36 on the four paramitas of purity, self, bliss, and perma­nence, GC says that all four essentially refer to the direct experience of bliss and not to counteracting the notions of impurity, nonself, suffering, and impermanence of sravakas through four opposite notions.946 For example, the remedy for mistaken sense appearances is not to negate these appear­ances through reasoning but to understand that they arise from impaired sense faculties and then to purify these faculties. Dharmaklrti holds that all thoughts are ignorance by nature and thus asserts that the inferential valid cognition of realizing that the skandhas lack a self is ignorance too. There­fore, the mistaken appearances of thoughts are relinquished through be­coming familiar with the samadhi of how things truly are but not through looking for other valid cognitions that are their opposites. Dharmaklrti as­serts that the substance of a thought contains both a part that is darkness and a part that is light, which is called “self-aware perception.” The manner of both eliminating the part of darkness through familiarization and ex­panding the part of light through familiarization appears in his treatises. If that is understood well, GC says, one will also understand the meaning of the statement in the last dharma wheel that the notions of impurity and so on are relinquished through the notions of purity and so on. Therefore, when all of samsaric existence appears as suffering for ¿ravaka noble ones, this appearance is relinquished through the remedy that consists of becom­ing familiar with the path of everything’s appearing as bliss, but it is not re­linquished through the path of a contrary mode of apprehending suffering. In that regard, Dharmaklrti says:One is liberated through the view of emptiness,While [all] remaining meditations are for the sake of that.947Likewise, here one would say:One is liberated through the appearance as bliss,While [all] remaining appearances are for the sake of that.Thus, one should be certain that all that appears as purity, permanence, and a self represents branches of the appearance as bliss. In this context, it may be asked, “It is true that the mistaken appearances of falling hairs and so"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"266 Translators Introductionon that are caused by an eye disease are not eliminated through inference but through an eye medicine that cures this disease. If the elimination of the mistaken appearances of the path of srávakas here without searching for inferences is similar to that, what is it that is comparable to that eye medicine?” This is a good question, GC says; the mistaken appearances of srávakas are purified through the medicine that is emptiness. Now, what is labeled here with the name “emptiness” is the Mahámudrá yoga of resting naturally in the sphere of appearances appearing just as they are, without agitating the mind through thoughts of removing and adding or negating and affirming. This is the equivalent of an eye medicine. The teaching on the four notions of purity and so on with regard to the dharmakáya refers to exactly this path of Mahámudrá—these notions do not represent any notions that cling to characteristics and that are something other than this path.948W hen Uttaratantra 1.137/140 speaks of the outbursts of the afflictions as being as repulsive as excrement, this is taught in terms of the path that relies on seeming reality. But here, when an intense thought of desire arises, Mahámudrá practitioners do not give rise to revulsion for it; nor do they turn their minds away from it. Rather, when they rest naturally right within that thought of desire, the condition that gave rise to this desire—the agi­tated mental sense faculty—will calm down. It is just this that is called “fa­miliarizing with purity”—thoughts are not impure; nor does this mean to entertain the thought of blindly labeling them as “ultimate purity.” Like­wise, when one rests in that very same state, resting as one has rested before in this stream of earlier and later moments of mind, there are no highs and lows of dualistic appearances. Therefore, it is labeled as “the notion of permanence.” Similarly, when one rests in a single space-like flow after the mind that rests in this way has become free from the clouds of mistaken appearances, this is called “having gained mastery over the mind” or it is labeled as “the notion of self.” When one rests in that very same state after having gained certainty that all mistaken appearances result from the du­alistic appearances of subject and object, personally experienced nondual wisdom dawns. Through its power, all thoughts of wishing to relinquish samsára and wishing to accomplish nirvána are at peace, and thus the mind is pained no more. This being free from all appearances of suffering is called “familiarizing with bliss.” Through these ways of explaining the four páramitás of purity, self, bliss, and permanence, the teaching that faith, pra- jñá, samádhi, and compassion are their corresponding four causes is also explained well."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 267All these explanations by GC obviously refer to the well-known Mahamudra principle that any confused or afflicted state of mind can be used as the object of Mahamudra meditation. Even the most intense out­bursts of otherwise very destructive emotions can thus be experienced as the tathagata heart’s four intrinsic qualities of genuine ultimate purity, self, bliss, and permanence. In other words, as the Mahamudra teachings al­ways say, buddhahood is to be found nowhere else than in our afflictions and obscurations. Therefore, in accordance with the Mahamudra hallmark “The essence of thoughts is the dharmakaya,” GC says that in terms of the definitive meaning, all afflictions ultimately are of the nature of the dharmakaya.949 By contrast, noble sravakas are said to be mistaken because they apprehend the afflictions as being real, just as an eye consciousness’s apprehending blue is said to be mistaken in comparison with an ultimate cognition.In that vein, Go Lotsawas comments on Uttaratantra I.24cd-25 about the inconceivability of the basic element, awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity highlight the tathagata heart as the single source of both confusion and awakening or samsara and nirvana, which is due to its two—ultimately inseparable—aspects of being empty and being aware, re­spectively.950 He says that the main subject of the Uttaratantra is the awak­ening (byang chub) of a buddha (sangs rgyas). Since the first two reasons in 1.25 teach the progression of the stains’ becoming pure, they teach the two aspects of being cleansed {byang) and being purified {sangs). Since the latter two reasons teach the qualities and their functions, they teach the two aspects of final realization {chub) and unfolding {rgyas). In terms of the ground, the first two reasons mainly teach the basic element’s aspect of being free from reference points because they teach that due to suffering and its origin’s being adventitious, they are primordially empty (and the basic element is empty of them). The latter two reasons mainly teach the aspect that the basic element abides as the phenomenon of basic awareness because they teach its qualities and activity. This is also the case because it is due to the basic element’s aspect of being free from reference points that it represents the nirvanas of the three yanas by virtue of this aspect of its being free from reference points’ being realized partially or in its entirety. It is due to the aspect of the basic element’s being basic awareness that it rep­resents the phenomena of samsara because the entirety of samsara arises from the alaya-consciousness that represents a mere reflection of this phe­nomenon of basic awareness’s appearing."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"268 Translators IntroductionNote here that though Go Lotsáwa generally explains the álaya-con- sciousness in detail based on passages from the Lañkávatarasütra and also quotes passages from this sütra that equate the álaya-consciousness with tathagatagarbha, he does not support the total equation of these two. Rather, he says that the álaya-consciousness, which represents the stains, is the support of samsara and comes to an end upon attaining buddhahood.951 Though the álaya-consciousness has come to an end at that point, there still exists the enlightened activity that promotes the welfare of all sentient beings for as long as there is space. Since that is impossible without a sup­port, this support is the actual tathagata heart. The álaya-consciousness is the most subtle aspect in the minds of sentient beings and therefore is also explained as “what focuses on the dharmadhátu.” It is very similar to the tathagata heart and can likewise not be grasped as “this” or “that” even by those who are learned in the ways of the world. It is just that much that those who know the pith instructions have expressed as “álaya.” Later, Go Lotsáwa clearly distinguishes between the álaya-consciousness and tathaga­tagarbha, saying that he explains mind as both the álaya-consciousness and the tathágata heart, but that he does not explain mind as the latter from the perspective of its being the actual tathágata heart.952 Rather, he explains mind (or the álaya-consciousness) as a reflection of the tathágata heart. If this is understood well, the direct seeing of suchness will arise swiftly.Go Lotsáwa s comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55/157-58 also stress the ultimate oneness of confusion and awakening or of the tathágata heart (be­ing the correct understanding of emptiness) and its adventitious stains.953 He says that if one realizes the tathágata heart to be pure of adventitious stains, one will definitely direct one’s mind toward its qualities, just as when one hears that the blurred vision of one’s old father has been cured and thus immediately understands that he can see forms clearly now. Bodhi­sattvas who understand the twofold principle of the distinctive features of emptiness—being empty of the adventitious stains but not being empty of the qualities—see that this is the true actuality of emptiness. Those bodhi­sattvas whose minds stray from this understanding of emptiness and who mentally engage in many ways in what is not it (regarding it as a kind of extinction or as being the same as or different from form and so on) are said to be distracted from it. During the phase of the view, those who hold such wrong views about emptiness do not rest in meditative equipoise in this true actuality and thus do not attain superior insight; nor will they at­tain one-pointed calm abiding. Therefore, it is said that their minds are distracted from emptiness during the phases of both view and meditation."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahámudrá 269If one understands the emptiness explained here, one will neither think that the extinction of desire is emptiness, nor that this very desire is emptiness, nor that emptiness exists somewhere else than in that desire. Therefore, through resting free from negation and affirmation right within, however this very desire may appear, one will see its natural luminosity through superior insight. At the same time, no matter which thoughts may arise, they function as aids for samádhi and thus this resting will also be one-pointed. Here, it is ultimate emptiness that is explained as emptiness, which is the tathágata heart that is also explained to be the ultimate reality that is called “the reality of the noble ones.” Without the samádhi during the level of engagement through aspiration that familiarizes with this tathágata heart, one is not able to realize the basic expanse without adventi­tious conceptions on the path of seeing and, through the continuity of that, perceive it directly as the buddhabhümi. On the other hand, it is taught that one is not distracted toward anything else if one realizes emptiness, just as it is, in the way described.954To wit, Go Lotsáwas stance that the tathágata heart is the basis of both samsára and nirvána and that in accordance with the Lañkávatárasütray the adventitious stains (the álaya-consciousness) and the tathágata heart are ultimately not different (the formers merely being a reflection of the latter) greatly matches the Mahámudrá hallmark that “the essence of thoughts is dharmakáya.” Given that Gó Lotsáwa explains the Uttaratantra and RGVV in relation to Mahámudrá, it is thus not so surprising that he relies so heav­ily on the Lañkávatárasütra despite those two texts’ not quoting this sütra at all. However, it is important that Go Lotsáwa, referring to the passage in the Lañkávatárasütra that tathágatagarbha was taught in order to prevent fear of emptiness and to attract the tlrthikas, does not subscribe to taking the instructions on tathágatagarbha as a teaching of expedient meaning. He explains:Some say, “Since this [sütra says], ‘in order to attract the tlrthikas’ it teaches the tathágata heart as being of expedient meaning.” Others answer them, “This is an explanation of the purpose of teaching the [tathágata] heart, but it is not an explanation that it is of expedient meaning.” I do not see either [statement] to be justified. For the in­tention in this [sütra] is that terms such as [tathágata] heart, sentient being, self, and mighty lord (xsvara) have an expedient [literally “guid­ing”] meaning and that through being guided by them, the meaning of ‘tathágata heart’ needs to be joined with identitylessness. One is not"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"270 Translators Introductionable to ascertain that the Lahkavatarasutra does not teach the tathagata heart that is explained in this Uttara[tantra from] beginning to end. Rather, in terms of guiding, it teaches the suchness that is explained here [in the Uttaratantra too].955Though Go Lotsawa here and elsewhere endorses the point that the tathagata heart cannot be realized without realizing emptiness or iden­titylessness, he makes it equally clear more than once that the tathagata heart is not just sheer emptiness, especially not the kind of emptiness that is understood as being a nonimplicative negation. Rather, the tathagata heart is the union of basic awareness and emptiness. Thus, the teachings on the tathagata heart are not merely a provisional device for those afraid of emptiness but represent the ultimate instructions on minds true nature or Mahamudra.Once in his commentary, Go Lotsawa explicitly denies the common Tibetan critique of Mahamudras being like the approach of the Chinese monk Hvashang Mahayana. As mentioned above, Hvashangs stereo­typed position served as a standard tool for accusing certain approaches within Tibetan Buddhism of being guilty of focusing solely on the ultimate (emptiness) while neglecting the accumulation of merit through the first five paramitas and so on. In general, GC makes it clear that the follow­ers of Mahamudra coined the conventional expression “looking at your own nature” for nothing but the perception of directly realizing the lack of any nature—emptiness—through looking (as understood in the gen­eral mahayana).956 In the context of addressing the critique that therefore Mahamudra is like Hvashangs approach, GC begins by quoting Bodhi- carydvatara IX.54:Emptiness is the remedy for the darkness Of afflictive and cognitive obscurations.So how could those who wish for omniscience Not swiftly meditate on it?957Then, he has someone object, “Well, isn’t the explanation of the Chinese monk Mahayana justified then? For he says that since one is able to eliminate everything to be relinquished and realize everything to be known solely through meditating on emptiness, the teachings on the aspect of skillful means (such as compassion, giving rise to bodhicitta, and the other five paramitas) are only for the sake of guiding naive beings but nor for"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 271those of sharp faculties.” GC gives three answers why this explanation is not justified. First, he adduces Nâgàrjunas Bodhicittavivarana 73:When yogins have meditated On this emptiness in such a way,There is no doubt that a mind-set of being devoted To the welfare of others will arise [in them].Thus, GC says, through meditating on emptiness, compassion will arise, and through that one will engage in skillful means.The second answer is that through meditating on emptiness, one will not only attain omniscience at the end but along the way too one will know many knowable objects one did not know before. Therefore, Bodhicaryà- vatdra VIII.94ab says:I need to remove the suffering of others Because it is suffering, just like my own suffering.Thus, it is taught that by virtue of that reason, one gives rise to an inferential valid cognition of realizing that the suffering of all other beings is something to be eliminated and then engages in the welfare of others. When many knowable objects appear through the power of meditation, one realizes through valid cognition that it is not appropriate not to promote the welfare of others.The third answer is that the great compassion of tathâgatas is included in the teaching of the last dharma wheel that sentient beings are naturally endowed with the buddha qualities. Since prajna and compassion are pri­mordially connected by nature, if one does not train in the vast means for the welfare of others, one does not relinquish the obscuration of not con­sidering the welfare of sentient beings—being ignorant about the welfare of limitless beings. Therefore, it is precisely by virtue of all obscurations being terminated through realizing emptiness that one engages in vast means.958Finally, it is to be noted that Gô Lotsâwa takes the nature of phenomena and nonconceptual wisdom to be continua of moments:Therefore, it is not the case that space—which is the mere existence of providing room, has a momentary nature, and possesses a contin­uum—is nonexistent. Here, in terms of time, the space at the beginning of an eon is not the space at the time of [its] destruction [and thus"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"272 Translators Introductionalso momentary in a sense]. In terms of location, the very substance that is the mere existence of providing room within a golden container is not the mere existence of providing room in an earthen container. Likewise, the moments of the basic element of sentient beings, which has the property of basic awareness and operates by way of being an uninterrupted series, do not turn into the moments of buddha wisdom. However, the two mere existences of providing room in a golden con­tainer and an earthen container, respectively, are not different in type. Likewise, the nonconceptuality of buddhas and the nonconceptuality of sentient beings are very much similar in kind, and there also are conventional expressions for their being one, such as saying, “I and the buddhas say the same.”959Thus, for Go Lotsáwa, the nature of phenomena and nonconceptual wisdom have the nature of momentariness and can thus be taken as the continuity of the stainless true nature of ones mind. This is explicitly made clear in his comments on the defining characteristic of the nature of phenomena:The commentary [on the Dharmadharmatávibhága by Vasubandhu] explains [the nature of phenomena] to be nothing but the continuum of stainless mind.960Go Lotsáwa supports this by referring to Maháyánasütrálamkára XIII. 19 and Vasubandhu s Dharmadharmatávibhügavrtti that both say that the na­ture of phenomena is the pure luminous mind.As mentioned above, among the eight ways of explaining buddha nature, GC presents Nágárjunas Dharmadhátustava as an example of teaching it as luminosity. The central importance of this text for Go Lotsáwas inter­pretation of the Uttaratantra along the lines of Mahámudrá is highlighted by his quoting forty-nine verses (about half of that text) and commenting on some from a Mahámudrá point of view. For example, GC quotes verses 18-22, which are very similar in content to the Uttaratantms nine examples of the tathágata heart and its obscurations:Spotless are the sun and moon,But obscured by fivefold stains:These are clouds and smoke and mist,Rahus face,961 and dust as well."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 273Similarly, mind so luminous Is obscured by fivefold stains.They’re desire, malice, laziness,Agitation, and doubt too.962A garment that was purged by fire May be soiled by various stains.When it’s put into a blaze again,The stains are burned, the garment not.Likewise, mind that is so luminous Is soiled by stains of craving and so forth.The afflictions burn in wisdom’s fire,But its luminosity does not.The sutras that teach emptiness,However many spoken by the victors,They all remove afflictions,But never ruin this dhatu.GC adds Uttaratantra 1.154-55/157-58 and then links all these verses with the Mahamudra approach of direcdy looking at ordinary mind.963 GC explains that no matter how the dharmadhatu is examined as emptiness through teaching the lack of any nature in the collection of reasoning, the luminosity that is inextinguishable despite its being associated with the afflictions since beginningless time cannot be negated through all the many sutras and reasonings that teach it as emptiness. Therefore, the view here is as follows. Without considering the actual way of being of phenomena, if one takes just the way they appear as what is valid, they indeed exist in the form of samsara and nirvana, matter and consciousness, the world and its inhabitants, and so on. However, if one takes their actual way of being as what is valid, this is the prajna of knowing that there is absolutely nothing other than mind and that this mind itself is “ordinary mind,” which is not established as any phenomenon whatsoever that has characteristics. What abides as the emptiness arrived at through reasoned analysis and as luminosity and what cannot be destroyed by anything is the tathagata heart. The reasonings that establish the lack of any essence whatsoever and the fact of mind’s abiding in the mode of being of luminosity indeed appear in many teachings of the Buddha but especially in the detailed explanations"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"274 Translators Introductionin the Ghanavyühasütra and the Lañkávatárasütra. The teachings on being empty of any nature as found in the Madhyamaka treatises no doubt apply here in just the same way too. However, consider that a cloud that appears like a mountain from afar does not exist that way, once you have arrived at it. The flickering of a mirage is not observable, once you have reached it. There is no person in a cairn, once you have come close to it. In just the same way, if minds and mental factors, which consist of afflictions and conceptions, are thoroughly examined through direct perception without relying on reasoning, they are seen to be nothing whatsoever. Therefore, even the features of a correct and false seeming reality are difficult to distinguish. Still, if one takes the world as what is valid, they can be distinguished.In its comments on Uttaratantra 1.25 on the inconceivable point of the tathagata hearts being naturally pure and yet being associated with afflic­tions, GC quotes Dharmadhatustava 36-37 and explains that the tathagata heart is to be found nowhere else than right within our mental afflictions.964About water at the time of spring,What we say is that its “warm.”Of the very same [thing], when its chilly,We just say that it is “cold.”Covered by the web of the afflictions,It is called a “sentient being.”Once its free from the afflictions,It should be expressed as “Buddha.”GC comments that it is nothing but the basic element or heart of sentient beings that represents ignorance, desire, and so on—desire and so on do not exist anywhere else than in this heart. Therefore, for those who are skilled in the path, this heart is to be searched for right within desire— it is not that pure phenomena are found anywhere else than in just such afflicted phenomena. Therefore, the statement “The essence of desire is the tathagata heart, but desire is adventitious” is truly inconceivable.GC also says that when one trains in the conduct of bodhisattvas by relying on the generation of ultimate bodhicitta, this training becomes very much advanced.965 When one familiarizes with the bodhicitta of focusing on the nature of the mind, the nature of the five sense consciousnesses and"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 275the mental consciousness will be realized to be luminosity. As it is said in Dharmadhatustava 38-43:In dependence upon eye and form,Appearances without a stain occur.From being unborn and unceasing,The dharmadhatu will be known.In dependence upon sound and ear,A consciousnesses [comes forth],With the mind of these three being dharmadhatu,Attained through being without any thoughts at all.966In dependence upon nose and smell,A nose consciousness [arises, all] being suchness,[But] conceptualizing the dharmadhatu That is formless and indemonstrable.967The nature of the tongue is emptiness,And the dhatu of the taste is void—Being of the dharmadhatus nature,Consciousness is nonabiding.Through tangible objects that have the characteristic of being conditions And the nature of a pure body [Arises] what is free from such conditions,Which I call “the dharmadhatu.968Once conception and its concepts are relinquished With regard to phenomena whose principal is mind,Due to the very lack of nature of phenomena,You should familiarize with them as dharmadhatu.969Accordingly, when the eighteen kinds of mental movements in the eighteen dhatus (the six consciousnesses, the six sense faculties, and the six objects) occur, one familiarizes with these very movements being luminosity. Due to being familiar with this, these very eighteen dhatus dawn as luminosity. Once they appear that way, this is called “accomplishment.” Based on"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"276 Translators Introductionthis, one attains the qualities of the completely pure six sense áyatanas as taught in the Saddharmapundaríkasútra, which says that there arise twelve times one hundred or eight times one hundred qualities in each of these áyatanas.970Furthermore, GC speaks about the buddha qualities (such as the ten powers) existing in sentient beings in a subtle way but not in their full­blown form.971 This is illustrated by the Avatamsakasutras example of a huge canvas with a map of an entire universes being contained in a single minute particle and the example of the six sense faculties of a cakravartins already existing in his embryo in the womb. In particular during the ten bhumis, these qualities increase further until they reach their perfection on the buddhabhumi. To support this, GC quotes verses 5-7 and 75-76 of the Dharmadhátustava:Just as a lamp thats sitting in a vase Does not illuminate at all,While dwelling in the vase of the afflictions,The dharmadhátu is not seen.From whichever of its sidesYou punch some holes into this vase,From just these various places then,Its light rays will beam forth.Once the vajra of samádhi Has completely smashed this vase,To the very limits of all space,It will shine just everywhere.972Just as when the waxing moon Is seen more in every moment,Those who’ve entered on the bhumis,See its increase step by step.On the fifteenth day of waxing,Eventually, the moon is full.Just so, when the bhumis’ end is reached,The dharmakáyas full and clear."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 277However, GC says that this should be understood in the following way. It is only the factor of the dharmadhatu s being pure of adventitious stains to a lesser or a greater degree that accounts for the buddha qualities’ first appearing to be subtle and then appearing to increase while progressing on the path, whereas the dharmadhatu itself never becomes something whose nature undergoes any change. This is just as when the space confined within a house becomes vast unrestrained space once this house collapses. However, just through that, space does not become something whose nature has changed. Therefore, verse 8 of the Dharmadhatustava says:Unarisen is the dharmadhatu,And never cease it will.At all times without afflictions,Stainless through beginning, middle, end.973Similarly, GC says about the relationship between the basic element and the notion of “fundamental change” in the Uttaratantra that they are the same in essence (suchness) and are only distinguished by the presence or absence of stains, respectively. Thus, in a general way, the tathagata heart is the primordial foundation for both afflicted and purified phenomena but is completely changeless in its own nature. “Change” refers only to its first also serving as the support of afflicted phenomena and later as the support of purified phenomena alone:The basic element or cause serves as the foundation of afflicted phe­nomena—its [state of] not being liberated from the cocoons of the afflictions is expressed by the name “tathagata heart.” Since it func­tions as the support of afflicted phenomena, it is the foundation [in the expression “fundamental change”]. Once its stains including their latent tendencies have become pure and do not return again, it does not function [anymore] as the foundation of afflictions. Therefore, having reverted from its former [state], it [then] functions as the sup­port of purified phenomena alone. Hence, this should be understood as the very essence of the fundamental change. The two of the basic element and the fundamental change are only distinguished through the existence or nonexistence of stains, but their essence is nothing but suchness.974"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"278 Translators IntroductionFinally, as mentioned above, CMWs introduction, most of the texts by Monlam Tsiiltrim, the Lamp, and GISM all exhibit a number of con­nections between the Uttaratantra and Mahamudra. For details on these connections, see the chapter “Overview of the Indian and Tibetan Texts Presented in This Book” and the translations below.In sum, all the sources presented here not only relate Mahamudra and the Uttaratantra but also show that there are clear sources for a sutra-based Mahamudra approach (whether it is based on the Uttaratantra or not) in India, in the Kagyii School, and even from the very beginning of the Kadampa School.The Geden KagyiX Tradition of MahamudraThis tradition of Mahamudra is said to be transmitted through two lin­eages.975 The short lineage originated with Vajradhara, who passed it on to Mahjusri, and the latter directly revealed it to Tsongkhapa. The long lin­eage also begins with Vajradhara but then goes through Vajrapani, Saraha, and Savaripa. From the latter, there are two branches, which unite again in Marpa Chokyi Lodro (1012-1097). The first one goes from Savaripa to Luipa, Darika, Dingkampa,976 Tilopa, Naropa, and Marpa. The second one involves Savaripa, Maitrlpa, and Marpa. Marpa transmitted both these lineages to Milarepa, who is followed by several Tagpo Kagyii masters up through the eleventh abbot of Drikung, Chokyi Gyalpo977 (1335-1407), who taught it to Tsongkhapa. Another Kagyii master from whom Tsongkhapa received Mahamudra teachings was Umapa Pawo Dorje,978 whose guru was the Drugpa Kagyii master Barawa Gyaltsen Balsang, a student of the Third Karmapa. In addition, Tsongkhapa received tantric Mahamudra-related transmissions from two students of Buton—Kyungpo Lhepa979 and Chokyi Balpa980 (both born fourteenth century)—as well as from two Sakyapas, Choje Tondrub Rinchen981 (1309-1385) and Rendawa Shonnu Lodro. Thus, it is obvious that at least the long Gelug Mahamudra lineage derives from well-established Kagyii lineages and does not include any Kadampa masters (therefore also not relying on texts such as those by Monlam Tsiil­trim). Though there is thus evidence that Tsongkhapa received Mahamudra teachings, there is not much evidence, if any, that he ever taught it. In any case, the short and long Gelug Mahamudra lineages are considered to have been transmitted orally by five more Gelug masters after Tsongkhapa in the form of an “ear-whispered lineage”982 until the teachings were writ­ten down for the first time by the First Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chokyi"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahámudrá 279Gyaltsen983 (1570-1622) in his Root Text o f the Mahamudra of the Precious Geden Kagyii, Highway o f the Victors and its autocommentary.984The autocommentary includes many quotes from Indian siddhas such as Saraha and from early Kagyii Mahámudrá masters (almost two-thirds of the quotes from Tibetan sources) and generally shows that its author was very familiar with Kagyü literature on Mahámudrá. By contrast, Tsongkhapa is only quoted four times. However, the expression “Geden Kagyii” in the title of the root text is ambiguous—it is not clear whether it means a combined Gelug-Kagyü system or a distinct “Gelug (oral) teaching lineage” (the lit­eral meaning of kagyu). The Panchen Lama does not explain it one way or the other, but almost all subsequent Gelugpa commentators on his text have supported the latter meaning, while the present Dalai Lama advocates the former.985 The autocommentary exhibits a convergence of the Gelugpa lamrim tradition and Kagyü Mahámudrá by pointing to the early figures of these two schools—Atiša and early Kagyü masters such as Milarepa, Lama Shang, Parno Trupa, and Jigden Surngon. Of course, this is at first glance reminiscent of Gampopas blending the two streams of Kadampa and Mahámudrá but, as the section on superior insight in the Panchen Lamas text shows, his manner of presenting Kagyü and Gelug teachings side by side—rather than actually blending them—is quite different.Like Kagyü Mahámudrá, the Panchen Lama explicitly supports the di­vision into sütra and tantra Mahámudrá, and his text focuses primarily on explaining the former. He rejects Sakya Panditas above-mentioned cri­tique of sütra Mahámudrá, while approvingly referring to Jigden Sumgon and Go Lotsáwa to the effect that Mahámudrá is found on all levels of the path. However, for the Panchen Lama, the Mahámudrá in the teachings of Saraha, Nágárjuna, Šavaripa, Náropa, Maitrlpa, Marpa, Milarepa, Gam- popa, Parno Trupa, and so on, is the quintessence of the completion stage practices of the Yogánuttara class of tantra, while sütra Mahámudrá re­fers to meditating on emptiness as explained in the prajñápáramitá sütras. According to the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, “the special feature of the ma­hamudra presentation of voidness meditation is that such meditation is focused primarily on the nature of the reality of mind.”986Among the Panchen Lama s explanations of calm abiding and superior insight as the twofold progressive approach to cultivate this sütra-based Mahámudrá, the discussion of calm abiding accords for the most part with similar Kagyü presentations, such as those by Tagpo Dashi Namgyal987 and Padma Karpo.988 However, he regards some of what is usually considered as part of superior insight in Kagyü Mahámudrá as only falling under the"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"28o Translators Introductionscope of calm abiding. He also says that everything that he classifies here as calm abiding only pertains to the conventional nature of the mind but not to its ultimate nature (a distinction not made in Kagyii Mahamudra).By contrast, the explanation of superior insight (which takes up about half of the Panchen Lama’s text) only superficially resembles Kagyii ac­counts. According to the Panchen Lama, it represents the guiding instruc­tions of his main guru Sangye Yeshe. By virtue of the Panchen Lama’s specific emphases and terminologies, it is the most distinctly Gelug section in his text. He begins by simply listing five general pointing-out instructions in terms of “cutting through a basis or root of mind”:989 (1) seeking the mind on the inside and the outside or in its arising, abiding, and ceasing, (2) seeking the mind in matter, (3) settling in uncontrived present awareness,(4) observing the nature of whatever arises, and (5) allowing thoughts to arise freely and become self-liberated, all of which are supported by quotes from Indian and Kagyii Mahamudra masters. Of course, these methods are considered crucial by numerous Kagyiipas and found in many of their Mahamudra texts. However, the Panchen Lama does not elaborate on them but goes on to present his detailed “teaching on the quintessence of these methods.” Here, he emphasizes the analysis of the person and the mind in terms of emptiness that is key to Gelug Madhyamaka. In this context, he also discusses distinctly Gelug topics such as the identification of the object of negation (dgag by a), the refutation of Madhyamaka versions that define the ignorant mistakenness of sentient beings either too narrowly or too widely, emptiness’ and dependent origination’s being equivalent, phenom­ena’s merely nominal existence versus their being empty of real existence (bden grub), and the object generality of emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation. Given the importance of superior insight—or the correct view— in Madhyamaka and the serious disagreements between Tibetan schools in that area, it is not too surprising that the First Panchen Lama adopts such a typical Gelug stance in this crucial section of his text.The Fourteenth Dalai Lama explains that in the Gelugpa system, the general difference between the sutras and the tantras lies in the type of mind through which emptiness is realized, while the emptiness of real exis­tence that both sutra and tantra aim at is the same.990 In particular, he says:Concerning the difference in mind that meditates on voidness, in the sutra tradition we employ an individualizing discriminating aware­ness for meditation to gain a correct view. For achieving vipashyana, an exceptionally perceptive state of mind, we need scrutinizing or"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra 281“analytical” meditation. We use individualizing discriminating aware­ness in meditation to scrutinize intelligently in order to discern void­ness. In the anuttarayoga tantra system, on the other hand, the mind that recognizes voidness engages only in absorptive, or “formal” med­itation with placement on certain vital points in the subtle vajra-body that are more special and more powerful than others. This is a great difference. By the force of there being a special mind that is aimed at voidness, there is the circumstance for attaining together, at the same occasion, both serenely stilled and settled, as well as exceptionally per­ceptive states of mind. Thus, by relying on special methods, we attain shamata and vipashyana simultaneously with anuttarayoga tantra meditation, whereas with the sütra methods we first achieve shamata by itself and then combine it with vipashyana. In either case, however, as our foundation we must meditate on a correct view of reality as ex­plained by Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti. Therefore the First Panchen Lama bases his presentation of voidness meditation on the teachings of Nagarjuna.In short, what does “mahamudra” mean in this context? Because voidness is the actual nature of all phenomena, or the manner in which all things exist, voidness is a “mudra” or seal. Voidness, as the manner in which everything exists, is the seal that guarantees the nature of all things in the sense that there is nothing that can go beyond this. Every­thing has voidness as its nature. Furthermore, because the realization of voidness liberates us from all the fetters of suffering and their causes, it is “maha” or great.991Obviously this understanding of sütra Mahamudra meditation as the analytical meditation on emptiness through discriminating prajna (which is by definition conceptual and inferential) is very different from the above-explained sütra-based Mahamudra approach of Maitrlpa and his students, Jnànaklrti, Gampopa, and all other Kagyü masters. For their ap­proach does not rely on inference, always emphasizes direct pointing-out instructions of minds true nature, and works with direct perceptions of this nature from the very beginning.On the general connection between prajnàpàramità and Mahamudra, a Gelugpa commentary on the Heart Sütra by Kungtang Gôncho Denpé Drônmé (1762-1823) declares:"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"282 Translators IntroductionIn general, all sutras flow into Mantra, but among these [sutras], the Perfection of Wisdom sutras have ways of directly flowing into Mantra that are unlike other sutras . . . such as . . . how the name “mother of Conquerors” is asserted to teach the great seal (mahamudra) of defin­itive meaning.992Finally, it should be mentioned that the late Nyingma master Diijom Rinpoche, in his discussion of buddha nature, not only uses the Uttaratan­tra and some tathagatagarbha sutras but also quotes several Mahamudra texts, such as Tilopas Pith Instructions on Mahamudra that he gave to Naropa on the banks of the Ganges, Maitrlpas Tattvadasaka, and Lama Shangs Ultimate Profound Path o f Mahamudra.993"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Overview of the Indian and Tibetan Texts Presented in This BookThe U ttaratantra an d RatnagotravibhagavyakhyaThe authorships and the meanings of the titles of these two texts, as well as their relationship, were already explained above.994 As for an overview of their contents, the Uttaratantras first chapter begins with a brief intro­duction of the seven vajra points (1.1-3),995 followed by descriptions of the first three of these points—the jewels of the Buddha, the dharma, and the samgha (1.4-22)—and an overview of the inconceivability of the last four vajra points (1.23-26). The tathagata heart (vajra point 4) is discussed by way of three reasons for all beings possessing it (1.27-28), a presentation in ten points (its nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment, manifestation, phases, all-pervasiveness, changelessness, and inseparability of qualities; (I.29-95ab), nine examples for its being covered but being unaltered by adventitious stains (I.95cd-152), its being realized through faith or confi­dence (1.153), its being empty of adventitious stains but not being empty of its inseparable qualities (1.154-55), and the purpose of its being taught, which also removes qualms about other sutras teaching that all phenomena are emptiness (1.156-67).Chapter 2 on buddha awakening (vajra point 5) starts by listing the eight points through which this topic is discussed (II.1-2). This is followed by the detailed explanation of these eight: its nature and cause (II.3-7), fru­ition (II.8-17), function (11.18-28), endowment (11.19-37), manifestation (11.38-61), permanence (11.62-68), and inconceivability (11.69-73).Chapter 3 on the qualities of awakening (vajra point 6) briefly intro­duces the thirty-two qualities of freedom pertaining to the dharmakaya and the thirty-two qualities of maturation pertaining to the rupakayas (III.1-3). This is followed by a verse with an example for each one of the three sets of the qualities of freedom: the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique buddha qualities (III.4), which are then explained in283"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"284 Translators Introductiondetail (III.5-7, 8-10, and 11-16, respectively). Next, there is a list of the thirty-two qualities of maturation (III. 17-26). The chapter is concluded by a summary of all sixty-four qualities (111.27-39).Chapter 4 on enlightened activity (vajra point 7) opens with two verses about this activity’s being effortless and uninterrupted (IV. 1-2). Buddha activity is explained in more detail through six points: deliverance (the ten bhtimis), their cause (the two accumulations), the result of that (awaken­ing), those who take hold of it (bodhisattvas), its obscurations (afflictions and their latent tendencies), and the condition for overcoming them (a buddhas compassion). Then, the features of enlightened activity are illus­trated through nine examples and their summary (IV. 13-88). Finally, it is explained how enlightened activity is partially similar and yet superior to each one of these examples (IV.89-98).Chapter 5 on the benefit of the teaching on the tathagata heart first demonstrates how the merit of even just hearing about it, let alone studying and practicing it, is superior to generosity, discipline, and dhyána (V.l-15). This is followed by four verses that describe on which basis the Uttaratan­tra was explained, what caused its composition, how it was explained, and what its characteristics are (V.16-19). Then, there are several verses on the means of protecting oneself from becoming deprived of the dharma, as well as on the causes and results of deviating from the dharma (V.20-24). The next verse is the dedication of the merit attained by the author through this teaching (V.25). The last three stanzas are a summary of the meaning of the previous ten verses (V.26-28).RGVV comments quite thoroughly in classical Indian scholarly fash­ion on the first four vajra points (with the exception of the nine exam­ples), while it contains only a few brief comments on the fifth vajra point and almost none on the remainder of the Uttaratantra. The text begins by correlating the seven vajra points individually with several sutras as well as matching them all with the Dháraníšvararájasútra. This is followed by detailed explanations of the eight qualities of the ultimate Buddha (bud­dhahood), the eight qualities of the ultimate dharma (the realities of cessa­tion and the realization of the path), and the two qualities of the ultimate samgha (irreversible bodhisattvas). The discussion of the inconceivability of the last four vajra points and their relationship is concluded by outlining the cause-and-result connection between all seven vajra points.In the context of explaining the fourth vajra point, R G W offers thor­ough explanations on the three types of beings: those who crave for samsara (ordinary beings), those who crave to be free from samsara (tlrthikas,"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 285sravakas, and pratyekabuddhas), and those who do not crave for either (bodhisattvas). Among these, only the latter are able to eventually realize the tathagata heart. This is connected with extensive comments on the in­trinsic qualities of the tathagata heart that consist of the four pàramitàs of supreme purity, self, bliss, and permanence, as well as their causes. R G W s actual comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 are preceded by a detailed ex­planation of the four beings who do not realize the tathàgata heart—ordi­nary beings, sràvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have newly entered the mahàyàna and are distracted by misunderstanding emptiness. The correct defining characteristic of emptiness in the case of the tathàgata heart is said to be presented by those two verses in terms of being free from the extremes of superimposition and denial.As for the scriptural sources and citations in the Uttaratantra and RGW , except for two verses from the Mahâyânasütrâlamkàra, all quotes and ref­erences are related to sütras:SrïmâlàdevJsütra, twenty-seven times (one related to vajra point 5; plus one reference to the explanation of the Buddha as the everlasting ultimate refuge)Anünatvâpürnatvanirdesaparivarta, nine times (vajra points 4 and 6)996 Sarvabuddhavisayâvatârajnânâlokâlamkârasütra, seven times Dhàranïsvararàjasütra, six times (plus a lengthy summary of its intro­duction to identify all seven vajra points)Tathágatagarbhasütra, two times (plus a reference to the nine examples for buddha natures being obscured by adventitious stains as stem­ming from this sùtra)997 Sàgaramatipariprcchâsütra, two times Mahâyânâbhidharmasütra, two timesDrdlmdhyasayaparivarta (or Sthirâdhyâsayaparivartasütra), one time (vajra points 1-3)Tathâgatagunajnânâcintyavisayàvatâranirdesa, one time (vajra point 7) Buddhâvatamsakasütra, one time Kášyapaparivarta, one time Gaganagañjapariprcchasütra, one timeRatnacûdapariprcchâsütra, one time (plus the example of the painters) Mahàparinirvànasütra, one time Vajracchedikâprajüâpâramitâsütra, one time Samyutta Nikâya, one timeRatnadàrikàsütra (one reference to being the source of the sixty-four qualities)"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"286 Translators IntroductionSaddharmapundarikasutra (referred to in Uttaratantra 11.58)prajnaparamita sutras (one reference in terms of understanding the paths of seeing and familiarization)As mentioned above, in terms of the number and the extent of these quotes, the main sources of the Uttaratantra as per RGVV are clearly the Dharanisvarardjasutra, the $rimdladevisutra> the Anunatvapurnatvanir- desaparivarta, and the Jndndlokdlamkarasutra99& In addition, R G W says that the seven vajra points come from the Dharanisvarardjasutra, the Sthiradhyasayaparivartasutra, the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta, the Srimaladevisutra, and the Tathagatagunajhanacintyavisaydvataranirdesa. Thus, all in all, there is an explicit attempt by RGVV to portray the teach­ings of the Uttaratantra as being squarely based on the mahayana sutras (primarily some from the third wheel of dharma). In terms of the con­tents of the Uttaratantra, three more sutras appear to be crucial. The nine examples of buddha natures being covered by adventitious stains derive from the Tathagatagarbhasutra. The sixty-four qualities of the dharma- kaya and the rupakayas together with their causes are found in the Ratna- darikasutra, and the examples for enlightened activity stem from the Jnanalokdlarnkdrasutra. In total, quotes or paraphrases from all these sutras occupy more than one third of RGVV.However, as mentioned above, it is somewhat mysterious why the Ut­taratantra identifies the Dharanisvarardjasutra as its main source. For the passages from this sutra that R G W correlates with the seven vajra points show hardly any correspondences to the specific terms and templates through which the Uttaratantra explains these vajra points. The sutra uses the terms “disposition/lineage of the three jewels” and “the dhatu (or ba­sic element) of sentient beings” several times, adding sometimes that this dhatu is impure, not stainless, and associated with afflictions or flaws. The Buddha is said to look at the impure dhatus of sentient beings and then guide those who are suitable through his enlightened activity. The sutra also distinguishes this dhatu as threefold—“being certain in terms of what is correct,” “being uncertain,” and “being certain in terms of what is mis­taken.” Though those terms and the related explanations are also found in RGVV (not in the Uttaratantra), they are not distinct enough from those found in other sutras and they do not cover enough of the thematic ground of the Uttaratantra for the Dharanisvarardjasutra to occupy its assigned central place in the Uttaratantra. In addition, there are many passages in other sutras, especially on the last four vajra points, that appear to be more"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"explicit and use more of the typical terminology of the Uttaratantra, such as the Srimaladevisutra, the Ahgulimaliyasutra, the Mahaparinirvanasutra, the Mahabherisutra, and the Lahkavatdrasutra.Among the sutras that were identified above as tathagatagarbha sutras, neither the Uttaratantra nor R G W quote or refer to the Ahgulimaliyasutra, the Mahaparinirvanasutra, the Lahkavatdrasutra, the Mahabherisutra, or the Ghanavyuhasutra, despite these sutras’ discussing the notion of tathaga- tagarbha and the first four explaining it in detail. Naturally, the Uttara­tantra and R G W do not agree with the Lahkavatarasutras equation of the tathagata heart with emptiness and the alaya-consciousness, as well as its statement that the tathagata heart is only taught for the sake of removing fear of emptiness and attracting non-Buddhists. Likewise, the different ex­planations in the Mahaparinirvanasutra of what “sentient beings’ possessing buddha nature” means and this sutra s ambivalent stance on those who lack the disposition to become buddhas (icchantika) are obviously very problem­atic for texts like the Uttaratantra and R G W . As for the other sutras above, especially those that were clearly in existence before the Uttaratantra and RGW, it is unclear why they were not used in these two texts.999Likewise, one cannot help wondering why the author of R G W chose the quotes from the four other sutras (the Sthiradhyasayaparivartasutra, the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta, the Srimaladevisutra, and the Tathagatagunajhandcintyavisayavataranirdesa) that he presents as the alternative sources of the seven vajra points besides the Dharanisvara- rdjasutra. CMW provides an explanation on how each one of these quotes relates to one of the seven vajra points through pointing out the fact that these points are difficult to realize.1000 It is acceptable that this general fea­ture of being difficult to realize, which is common to all seven vajra points and is explained in R G W as the reason for their bearing this name, is mir­rored more or less explicitly in those quotes. However, passages on the gen­eral feature of the topics that correspond to the seven vajra points’ being difficult to realize can be found in many sutras, not just the four quoted in RGW . More significantly, in their brevity and quite general tone, those quotes do not specifically match the particular ways and terms through which the Uttaratantra itself explains the seven vajra points.As for the contents of the Uttaratantra as per some of the Tibetan com­mentaries used in this book, CMW says that this text teaches the subject matter that consists of the profound and vast seven vajra points, which represents the mahayana.1001 RYC states that Maitreya composed the Ut­taratantra in order to make those who have the highest faculties andOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 287"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"288 Translators Introductionminds with consummate faith and virtue understand the more than six­teen “sutras that ascertain the ultimate and teach the definitive meaning” (such as the Dharanisvarardjasutra), which are very profound and difficult to realize.1002 YDC says that the Uttaratantra is a commentary on the quin­tessence of the mahayana, which consists of the tathagatagarbha sutras.1003 It is the extraordinary commentary on the intention of the final wheel of dharma that clearly teaches the ultimate definitive meaning—the sugata heart. GC says that the Uttaratantra teaches the meaning of all yanas, but that its primary meaning concerns the last or unsurpassable turning of the wheel of dharma.1004 It also shows the difference between the expedient and the definitive meanings of the Buddha’s words. According to HLS,1005 the Uttaratantra is the one among the five works of Maitreya that teaches the ultimate definitive meaning, the heart of the matter, and its intention also accords with the teachings on the heart of the matter by Savaripa and Mai- tripa (that is, Mahamudra).JKC explains that the Uttaratantra is the highest of all dharmas taught by the Buddha, being the unsurpassable one or the peak of the mahayana scriptures.1006 It is the commentary on the intention of teaching the heart of the matter, the lions roar of irreversibility, thus being the king of all treatises. It is a treatise that clearly teaches all the topics of the profound sutras of definitive meaning (the four sutras of definitive meaning of Mere Mentalism and the tathagatagarbha sutras as listed above in JKC) through summarizing them into the seven vajra points. JKC adds that Rongton and others assert that the Uttaratantra is not just a commentary on the intention of only the last dharma wheel but represents a general commentary on the sutras that teach the definitive meaning. They are said to enumerate about fif­teen of these sutras, such as the Tathagatamahakarunanirdesasutra, Sthira- dhyasayaparivartasutra, and Saddharmapundarikasutra.Mipham Rinpoche states that the single essential point of all dharmas in the sutras and tantras is solely the all-pervading sugata heart, and the text that teaches it clearly is the Uttaratantra.1007The Indian Texts on the UttaratantraWhen not counting R G W as a separate work, there are three known and preserved Indian works on the Uttaratantra—Sajjanas SM, Vairocanaraksi- tas VT, and a commentary by Ratnavajra (presently unavailable).

Johnston first mentioned Sajjana’s work (SM) in 1950 (having seen a plate photographed by Sankrtyayana that is preserved in Patna),1008 and then Giuseppe Tucci mentioned it and photo­graphed the manuscript himself (probably in the Tibetan Shalu1009 monas­tery).1010 Based on this photocopy by Tucci, Takasaki (1974) first published a transcription of the text (without the interlinear notes). At present, the original manuscript is not accessible, but its photographs by Sankrtyayana and Tucci are.1011 Tuccis photograph in the possession of Professor Taka­saki was provided to Kazuo Kano, who used it for his critical edition of the text (Kano 2006, 513-18). The manuscript in one folio is in Sarada script, and it was written sometime between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. The text consists of thirty-seven verses with interlinear glosses on verses 1-8, 10-17, 19-26, 28-29, 31, and 33 (both verses and glosses are written in the same hand).In order to present an overview of SM, lets compare the outlines of Sajjana s text by Takasaki and Kano as well as my own.Takasaki s Outline1012Verses 1-6: The three jewels {Uttaratantra 1.1-3)Verses 7-15: Buddha nature and its three characteristics (1.27-28) Verses 16-19: The soteriological path consisting of the ten topics (1.29-94)Verses 20-25: The ten topics related to the nine defilements (1.130-43) Verses 26-27: The ten topics related to the three characteristics of buddha nature (1.144-52)Verse 28: Refuting the objection to the authoritative teaching {aptabadhoddhara) (1.156-167)Verses 29-32: Buddhas awakening (II)Verse 33: Buddha qualities (III)Verse 34: Buddha activities (IV)Verses 35-36: Virtue of blessing and protecting the treatise (V.l-24) Verse 37: Dedication (V.25-28)1013"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"290 Translators IntroductionKano s Outline1014Verses 1-4: The three jewels (1.1-22)Verses 5-7: The seven vajrapadas (1.3 and 23-26)Verses 8-15: The buddha nature (1.26-28,145, and 149)Verses 16-19: The ten topics (1.29-94)Verses 20-22: The ten topics and defilements (1.96-143)Verses 23-27: The threefold nature (1.144-52)Verse 28: Aptabadhoddhara (1.156-67)Verses 29-32: Bodhi (II)Verse 33: Guna (III)Verse 34: Karman (IV)Verses 35-36: Anusamsa (V.l-24)Brunnholzls OutlineVerses 1-5: The three jewels (1.3-22)Verses 6-7: Synopsis of the remaining four vajra points (1.23-26) Verses 8-28: The basic element (dhatu) (1.27-167)8-9: The three reasons (1.27-28)10-15: The divisions and fruitions of the disposition (1.1-3, 26, 28,145, and 149)16-19: Function of the ten topics (I.29-95ab)20 -22: The ten topics and the afflictions in the nine examples (I.95cd- 143ab)23-27: Familiarization with the threefold nature of the basic element through the ten topics and the nine examples (I.143cd-155)28: Refutation of objections to the teachings on buddha natures being authoritative (1.156-67)Verses 29-32: Awakening (II)Verse 33: The qualities (III)Verse 34: Activity (IV)Verses 35-36: Benefit and protection (V.l-24)Verse 37: Dedication (V.25)As for the contents of Sajjana s text, it is significant that its title identifies it as a “pith instruction” (upadesa) on the Uttaratantra and not as a summary (samgraha, pindartha, or the like). Indeed, the text is not just a simple synopsis of Maitreyas text but also presents Sajjana s original interpretation that is based on his own contemplative approach to the Uttaratantra. Generally"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 291speaking, verses 1-15 of SM outline a contemplative system based on the seven vajra points, and verses 16-27 teach how “the threefold nature” of the basic element (the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition as briefly summarized in Uttaratantra 1.27-28), the ten topics, and the nine examples fit into this system and flesh it out. In particular, Sajjana (explicitly or implicitly) reveals the mutual correlations between the Uttaratantra s key themes of “the threefold nature,” the ten topics, the nine examples, and the nine afflictions illustrated by these examples. These correlations can be regarded as a brief contemplative manual for using the contents of the Uttaratantra (in particular its first chapter) as a soteriological path.This soteriological approach to the Uttaratantra is explicitly outlined in verses 2-4, 6-7, 10-27, and 29-30. The purpose of teaching the ultimate refuge, the Buddha, is to generate bodhicitta, which eventually results in the attainment of full awakening (verses 2-3), through showing the ultimate fruition of this bodhicitta. Besides the well-known twofold classification of the disposition for awakening (the tathagata heart) into the naturally abid­ing disposition and the accomplished (or unfolding) disposition (verse 10), Sajjana also presents his own threefold classification as the disposition that is suchness, naturally abiding, and accomplished (verse 15). He says that, in general, those who gradually purify the tathagata heart progress through the paths of accumulation, preparation, seeing, and familiarization (verse 6). However, the actual path in terms of the unfolding of the naturally abid­ing disposition begins only with the path of seeing (verse 10), when the tathagata heart is directly seen for the first time. In order to accomplish this, the causes or focal objects of the path of purifying the tathagata heart are six—the three jewels and the three conditions that consist of the awakening of a buddha, its qualities, and the resulting enlightened activity for sentient beings, with the latter primarily manifesting as the teaching of the pro­found and the vast (verses 11-12). In particular, the three jewels manifest as (external) conditions for those who have not yet gathered the accumula­tions of merit and wisdom (verse 4).Based on these causes and conditions, those who wish to reveal their tathagata heart should engage in reflection and familiarization by relying on the ten topics discussing the basic element (verse 7). Among these ten topics, to contemplate (1) the “nature” of the basic element represents the foundation of the path. This nature is matured or comes to life through(2) its “cause” (faith in the dharma, supreme prajnâ, samâdhi, and com­passion). To reflect on (3) “fruition” leads to firm conviction in the Bud­dhist path. Thus, the contemplation of topics (1)—(3) makes one free from"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"292 Translators Introductionmundane desire, that is, one is left only with the latencies of desire, hatred, and ignorance. Through contemplating (4) the “function” of the tathagata heart (weariness of suffering and striving for nirvana), one actually engages in the path. (5) “Endowment” in terms of the basic elements being asso­ciated with three causal and three resultant qualities makes up the path of seeing. (6) “Manifestation” (the suchness of ordinary beings, noble ones, and buddhas) is the basis of the path of familiarization. The actual path of familiarization consists of (7) “phases” and (8) “all-pervasiveness,” which leads to the relinquishment of obscurations such as aiming at lesser forms of awakening. The evolution of the path on the last three bhumis is due to (9) the “changelessness” of the dharmadhatu. For, by virtue of its being nonempty, unbound, inexhaustible, and unceasing, the dharmadhatu has the intrinsic nature of nonconceptuality. That the final fruition of the path can be reasonably expected to occur is due to the nature of (10) the “insep­arability” of the tathagata heart and all buddha qualities, due to which it is identical with the final result of the path (verses 16-19). In this way, the ten topics not only describe the stages of the entire path, but the reflection on, and familiarization with, them is what actually constitutes the path.In this process of contemplating the ten topics and familiarizing with them, the nine except for “manifestation” (due to suchnesss being ex­plained as not serving as a basis for afflictions) make one understand the following eight kinds of afflictions or clingings. (1) Nature, (2) cause, and(3) fruition make one understand (l)-(3) the latencies of desire, hatred, and ignorance, respectively; (4) function makes one understand (4) the in­tense outbursts of these afflictions; (5) endowment with three results makes one understand (6) the afflictions to be relinquished through seeing; (7) phases and (8) all-pervasiveness make one understand (7) the afflictions to be relinquished through familiarization; (9) changelessness makes one understand (8) the afflictions on the impure bhumis; and (10) inseparabil­ity makes one understand (9) the afflictions on the pure bhumis.1015 In ad­dition, the nine examples assist one in understanding the natures of these kinds of afflictions or clingings (verses 20-22).Sajjana also mentions the close relationship between the ten topics and the nine examples (verse 24), though he does not spell out their detailed correlations. However, based on the familiar correlations between the nine examples and the nine afflictions as described in Uttaratantra 1.130-43 and in analogy to Sajjanas above correlations between the ten topics and the nine afflictions, the correlations between the ten topics and the nine ex­amples can be established too.

In other words, as is also pointed out by R G W s comments on 1.27-28,1017 the ten topics as well as the nine examples represent the detailed explanations of the condensed meaning of “the threefold nature” (verses 25 and 27). In particular, the brief synopsis of “the threefold nature” is the basis for engaging in reflection, while the ten topics are what one should familiarize with extensively through meditation (verses 25-26).Thus, based on the correlations between “the threefold nature” and the nine examples as described in Uttaratantra 1.144-52 as well as Sajjana s cor­relations between these examples and the ten topics, one can also establish the correlations between “the threefold nature” on the one hand and the ten topics and the nine afflictions on the other hand.In more detail, Uttaratantra 1.144-52 outlines the correlations between “the threefold nature” and the nine examples such that the dharmakàya corresponds to the examples of (1) a buddha, (2) honey, and (3) a kernel; suchness corresponds to (4) gold; and the disposition corresponds to (5) a treasure, (6) a sprout, (7) a buddha image, (8) a cakravartin, and (9) a precious statue.Consequently, among the three natures, the dharmakàya correlates with the topics of (1) nature,1018 (2) cause, and (3) fruition; suchness correlates with (4) function; and the disposition correlates with (5) endowment, (6) manifestation,1019 (7) phases, (8) pervasiveness, (9) changelessness, and (10) inseparability.Likewise, as for the relationships between “the threefold nature” and the nine afflictions, through the dharmakàya, one understands (l)-(3) the la­tencies of desire, hatred, and ignorance; through suchness, one understands(4) the intense outbursts of these afflictions; and through the disposition,"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"294 Translators Introductionone understands (6)-(7) the afflictions to be relinquished through seeing and familiarization, (8) the afflictions on the impure bhümis, and (9) the afflictions on the pure bhümis.1020In particular, Uttaratantra 11.15-17 describes buddhahood, the dhar­makaya, as having nine superior characteristics, which are illustrated by what is obscured in the nine examples: the Buddha, showing that buddha­hood has the nature of being equal to the unequaled; honey, symboliz­ing that buddhahood bestows the taste of the genuine dharma; a kernel, illustrating that buddhahood is free from what is useless; gold, standing for buddhahoods purity; a treasure, meaning that buddhahood has ended poverty due to its qualities; a tree, symbolizing that buddhahood grants the fruit of liberation; a precious figure, showing that the “body” of buddha­hood consists of the jewel of the dharma; a cakravartin, indicating that a buddha is the supreme lord of human beings; and a golden image, showing that buddhahood has the appearance of a precious form.Finally, as for matching the three or four kàyas, the three dispositions mentioned in SM, and the nine examples, the dharmakaya corresponds to the examples of (1) a buddha, (2) honey, and (3) a kernel. Its equivalent, the svàbhàvikakàya, corresponds to (7) a precious statue. The sambhogakàya corresponds to (8) a cakravartin, and the nirmànakàya corresponds to (9) a golden image. Among SMs three dispositions, the disposition as suchness corresponds to (4) gold; the naturally abiding disposition corresponds to(5) a treasure; and the accomplished disposition corresponds to (6) a fruit tree. In due order, these three dispositions are the causes of the svàbhàvika­kàya,1021 the dharmakàya, and the two rüpakàyas.Sajjana concludes (verses 23-27) that, by virtue of familiarizing with the ten topics and the progression of the nine examples (as presented in Ut­taratantra 1.144-52), the brief summary of “the threefold nature” is found to implicitly include also the presentation of what is to be relinquished (the nine afflictions) and what is to be attained (the corresponding levels of pu­rity of the tathàgata heart).This process of purifying the basic element culminates in two results— the impure result consists of progressively attaining what the three jew­els embody (the first three vajra points) on the eighth, ninth, and tenth bhümis, respectively,1022 while the pure result consists of instantaneously attaining awakening, its qualities, and its enlightened activity (the last three vajra points) on the buddhabhümi. Sajjana also refers to that impure result as “the threefold kàya” and refers to the pure result as “the threefold dhar­makàya” (verses 3,12-15, and 29-30)."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 295In sum, by combining what is said in Uttaratantra 1.3, 1.23, 1.26, and RGVV, Sajjana presents a single continual soteriological system of reveal­ing the unconditioned and luminous tathagata heart (vajra point 4) by shedding its adventitious stains through the six conditions of the first three and the last three vajra points. The first three vajra points, the three jew­els, are the conditions that motivate one to generate bodhicitta and gather the accumulations of merit and wisdom up through the seventh bhumi, while they also represent results that are attained on the eighth, ninth, and tenth bhumis, respectively. The last three vajra points are the conditions for attaining the final fruition up through the tenth bhumi, while they also represent the instantaneous final result on the eleventh bhumi. In this way, Sajjana describes these six vajra points as having the double function of being conditions extrinsic to the tathagata heart on lower levels of the path (someone else who is a buddha, his teachings, and his samgha, as well as his awakening, qualities, and enlightened activity) and being results intrinsic to the tathagata heart on higher levels (ones own tathagata hearts manifesting as the three jewels, awakening, its qualities, and its enlightened activity). It seems that the double functions of the six vajra points in Sajjanas presen­tation in connection with the differences in Uttaratantra 1.3,1.23, and 1.26 led Ngog Lotsawa to speak of two cycles in terms of the causal relationship between the seven vajra points.1023 According to Sajjanas SM, the process through which the tathagata heart is revealed is primarily contained in the fourth vajra point because this process consists of contemplating its three­fold nature (the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition) as the basis, which is deepened through the ten topics, the nine examples, and the mul­tiple correlations between these three sets.The following charts provide an overview of all the explicit and implicit correlations between “the threefold nature,” the ten topics, the nine exam­ples, and the afflictions illustrated by these examples that are found in the Uttaratantra, RGVV, and SM."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"296 Translators IntroductionTh e t e n to pic s a n d t h e stages of t h e path (SM 16-19)Topic Stage of the pathnaturefoundation of the pathcause (wisdom)maturationfruitionfirm conviction in the pathfunctionengaging in the pathendowmentpath of seeingmanifestationbasis of the path of familiarizationphases and all-pervasivenesspath of familiarizationchangelessnessevolution of the path on the last threebhümisinseparabilityexpecting the final fruitionThe ten topics and the nine examples (implicit)TopicExamplenaturebuddha in a decaying lotuscausehoney amid beesfruitionkernels in their husksfunctiongold in filthendowmenta sprout from a fruitmanifestationa treasure below the earthphases and all-pervasivenessa buddha image in a tattered garmentchangelessnessa cakravartin in the womb of adestitute womaninseparabilitya precious statue in clay"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Overview of the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 297 The ten topics and the nine afflictions (SM 20-22)TopicAfflictions to be understoodnaturelatencies of desirecauselatencies of hatredfruitionlatencies of ignorancefunctionthe intense outbursts of these afflictionsendowmentafflictions to be relinquished through seeingphases and all-pervasivenessafflictions to be relinquished through familiarizationchangelessnessafflictions on the impure bhumisinseparabilityafflictions on the pure bhumisThe nine afflictions and the nine examples (Uttaratantra 1.130-43)AfflictionsExampleslatencies of desiredecaying lotuslatencies of hatredbeeslatencies of ignorancehusksthe intense outbursts of these afflictionsfilthafflictions to be relinquished through fruitseeingafflictions to be relinquished through tattered garmentfamiliarizationafflictions on the impure bhumiswomb of a destitute womanafflictions on the pure bhumisprecious statue in clay"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"298 Translators IntroductionThe nine examples and the nine features of the fruition (Uttaratantra II. 15-17)Features of the fruition Exampleshaving the nature of being equalbuddhato the unequaledbestowing the taste of the genuinehoneydharmabeing free from what is uselesskernelbeing puregoldhaving ended poverty due to itstreasurequalitiesgranting the fruit of liberationtreeits body consisting of the jewel ofprecious figurethe dharmabeing the supreme lord of humancakravartinbeingshaving the appearance of a preciousgolden imageformThe threefold nature and the ten topics (implicit)NatureTopicdharmakayanaturecausefruitionsuchnessfunctiondispositionendowmentmanifestationphasespervasivenesschangelessnessinseparability"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 299The threefold nature and the nine examplesNature(Uttaratantra 1.144-52) Exampledharmakàyabuddhahoneykernelsuchnessgolddispositiontreasuresproutbuddha image cakravartin precious statueThe threefold nature and the nine afflictions (implicit)NatureAfflictions to be understooddharmakàyalatencies of desire latencies of hatred latencies of ignorancesuchnessthe intense outbursts of these afflictionsdispositionthe ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance afflictions to be relinquished through seeingafflictions to be relinquished through familiarization afflictions on the impure bhumis afflictions on the pure bhumis"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"300 Translators IntroductionThe three kàyas, the three dispositions, and the nine examples (Uttaratantra 1.146-47 and 11.149-52;

However, its authorship is not clear because there were two panditas by the name Vairocanaraksita.The first Vairocanaraksita is an eleventh-century contemporary of Atisa from Vikramaslla who authored the Siksakusumahjali (a commen­tary on Santidevas Siksasamuccaya), a Bodhisattvacaryavatarapanjika, and a Sisyalekhatippani. Given the sutra-based nature of the Uttaratantra and the scholarly style of VT, this Vairocanaraksita may seem a more likely can­didate as VT s author, but this is not conclusive.The second Vairocanaraksita is a twelfth-century tantric master from Somapuri in Daksina Kosala (present-day western Orissa), who stayed in Nepal for some time between 1101 and 1106 and in Tibet in the 1140s and 1150s. It is known that Vairocanaraksita/-raksa was another name of Vai- rocanavajra, and the biographies under each name show several common features, in particular the birth place, the same time of flourishing, certain practices, the prominent role in the transmission and translation of the dohas, and the same students. Therefore, we must be looking at the same figure. When Vairocanaraksita stayed at Nalanda, he received many pith instructions from a yogin named Surapala, which included Maitrlpa s cycle"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 301on mental nonengagement, many dohas, Mahamudra, and the Hevajratan- tra. Later, he also studied prajnaparamita, Madhyamaka, and various tan- tras with Pandita Gunaraksita from Vikramaslla. He received Santidevas texts and many sadhanas from Dhanaraksita and also learned from Jaya- kara and the panditas Sarana, Sudhanagupta, and Abhayakaragupta. He traveled widely in India, went to China, and visited Tibet five times. He was a main figure in the doha tradition and also became a teacher of the Nepal­ese Asu Kyeme Dorje,1026 the First Karmapa, Lama Shang Dsondrii Tragpa, and Tropu Lotsawa Jampa Bal.In the Tengyur, besides the above sutric works authored by the first Vai- rocanaraksita, we find the name Vairocanaksita as the author of a sadhana and a mandala ritual for Vajrabhairava, as well as the translator of Sarahas Dohakosanamamahamudrdpadesa, Aryasuras Paramitdsamdsa, Visesam- itras Vinayasamgraha, and several sadhanas. The name Vairocanavajra is given as the translator of Sarahas Kakhasya Doha and its autocommen­tary, the Dohakosas of Krsna and Tilopa, Maitrlpas Dohakosapanjika, the Srivirupapadacaturasiti, as well as a number of sadhanas and other tantric texts.Vairocanaraksitas brief commentary VT does not present his own philosophical view or any general discussions but simply glosses selected words or phrases from the Uttaratantra and R G W by offering synonyms and sometimes analyzing the grammatical structure of certain words and phrases. This commentary is no doubt very helpful for understanding the Uttaratantra and R G W and is also useful in establishing the correct read­ing of the Sanskrit manuscript of R G W . However, it obviously had no noticeable impact on the Tibetan exegetical tradition of the Uttaratantra.The Tibetan CommentariesA Commentary on the Meaning of the Words of the “Uttaratantra”The colophon of this commentary (CMW) says that it preserves the words of Marpa Lotsawas teachings on the Uttaratantra1027 and was prepared ac­cording to the assertions of Parahitabhadra. Thus, it appears to have been composed or compiled by a student of Marpa Dopa. As mentioned above, the latter had received teachings on the Uttaratantra from Parahitabhadra and possibly Sajjana (it is possible that this student of Marpa also received direct teachings from Parahitabhadra or Sajjana, but it is not very likely). BA says that Marpa Dopa transmitted the Maitreya texts to Nyingpugpa Chokyi Tragba (1094-1186), so the latter could be the actual author of"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"302 Translators IntroductionCMW.1028 In any case, this author must have had access to, and knowledge of, the Sanskrit text of the Uttaratantra since he refers to it in compari­son to Ngog Lotsàwas translation. This and the fact that CMW mentions some of Ngogs positions show that it was composed later than Ngogs commentary.1029CMW is a commentary on both the Uttaratantra and R G W (also providing headings or referential glosses for different parts of RG W ). However, CMW never quotes the verses of the Uttaratantra in full when commenting on them (sometimes, CMW provides the initial words of a verse or of the first one in a number of verses that it comments on). In its comments on RGW , CMW follows the common Indian style of a subcom­mentary by briefly indicating the beginnings (and often the ends) of the passages in R G W that it comments on.1030 At the same time, CMW also includes an extensive outline, though it is not strictly held to. Thus, CMW s comments are sometimes given in a looser fashion than later Tibetan com­mentaries with their strictly structured outlines.The introduction to CMW (called “the explanation of the stainless basic element”), which precedes its actual comments on the verses of the Ut­taratantra and RGW , is sometimes sketchy and often feels more like per­sonal notes. It identifies itself as containing the pith instructions on the Uttaratantra and corresponds very much with Mahâmudrâ instructions in both its experiential style and contents (though the term “Mahâmudrâ” is never mentioned). By contrast, the actual commentary is much more schol­arly, and sometimes clearer and easier to understand. Though included un­der the same title, these two parts of CMW seem like two different texts written for two different purposes—more personal meditation instructions based on the Uttaratantra versus the actual commentary on the verses of this text and R G W .CMWs introduction uses the term “pointing out” many times and dis­cusses the pith instructions on the basic element in three main points: (1) the results (the three jewels) being condensed in the Buddha—the ultimate place of refuge that is the dharmakàya of ones own mind, (2) the cause (the tathàgata heart) being condensed in the Buddha—taking the three natures into ones mind,1031 and (3) the conditions (awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity) being condensed in the Buddha—being free from the stains of conception.In more detail, the introduction refutes all external phenomena and af­firms the internal nature of the mind as being the dharmakàya—the insep­arability of the unconditioned expanse and self-arisen, self-aware wisdom,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"whose nature is lucid and unceasing. All adventitious stains are nothing but thoughts, and through realizing the luminous nature of the mind and let­ting thoughts be as lucid wisdom in an uncontrived manner, their essence is realized as lacking any root and thus they are self-liberated. In other words, sentient beings are nothing but the adventitious flaws of thoughts and therefore one familiarizes with them as being nonentities.1032 Buddha- hood is nothing but the luminosity of ones own mind having become free from these adventitious stains. Without thoughts and clinging, everything that appears and exists dawns as the essence of the three kàyas. This is the way to bring the naturally luminous tathàgata heart onto the path to bud- dhahood. This path starts with the path of accumulation, when ones own mind is pointed out as luminosity. On the path of preparation, one famil­iarizes with what was pointed out. The realization of luminous mind on the path of seeing is the dharmakàya. On the path of familiarization, one still needs effort to realize luminous mind, which represents the sambhoga- kàya. On the buddhabhümi, although self-arisen wisdom has been seized within oneself, one has the welfare of others in mind, which represents the nirmànakàya.Besides such Mahàmudrà-like instructions in CMWs introduction (it also repeatedly uses the typical Mahâmudrâ term “beyond mind”),1033 the text likewise exhibits terms and explanations that are familiar in the Dzog- chen teachings. The text speaks of “alpha-pure (ka dag) ultimate luminosity” and also repeatedly mentions basic awareness (rigpa), while distinguishing it from the ordinary dualistic mind (sems). It says that, first, at the time of basic awarenesss being pointed out, one directs the mind toward ba­sic awareness, scrutinizes thoughts, and rests in this unconditioned basic awareness. Second, at the time of basic awarenesss entering the path, one rests in assessing how to separate the pure essence from the dross in terms of the stains of thoughts and luminous self-arisen wisdom.1034 Third, as for wisdoms seizing its own ground, one scrutinizes thoughts with some effort. As for thoughts not needing to be relinquished and being pure, the Uttaratantra says, “There is nothing to be removed in this.” As for self­arisen wisdom dawning without needing to be accomplished, it says, “not the slightest to be added.” Fourth, as for self-arisen wisdom s being pointed out, one needs to search for the reality of thoughts, and the aftermath of that is the realization of the lucid nature of phenomena as being like space. In this way, one familiarizes with separating the pure essence from the dross with regard to basic awareness. The pure essence is self-arisen wis­dom, and the dross consists of thoughts—ordinary cognitions. The fruitionOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 303"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"304 Translator s Introductionis the twofold separation of the pure essence from the dross with regard to basic awareness—self-arisen wisdom’s ability to stand its own ground being the nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise, and the ability to cope with all kinds of circumstances through having mastered appearances be­ing subsequent attainment.In its actual comments on the Uttaratantra and RGW , CMW says that the Dhdranisvararajasutra represents the primary sutra source of the Uttaratantra, while the remaining sutras that are referred to in the Uttaratantra and R G W are the secondary sources. Accordingly, CMW includes lengthy paraphrases and quotes from most of the Dharanisvara- rajasutras introduction and the beginning of its main part on the three jewels, the sixty kinds of factors of purifying the buddha element, and the eighty attributes of buddhas, which are given as the sources for all seven vajra points in this sutra (beyond that, there are four more quotes from the Dhdranisvararajasutra). The further sutra quotes are:Srimaladevisutra, sixteen times Tathagatagarbhasutra, six timesSarvabuddhavisaydvatdrajhandlokdlamkarasutra, four times Anunatvapurnatvasutra, three times Sthiradhyasayaparivartasutra, two times Dasabhumikasutra, two times Sagaramatipariprcchasutra, two times Lahkavatdrasutra, two times Ratnacudapariprcchdsutra, two times Aksayamatinirdesasutra, two times Mahaparinirvanasutra, one time Abhidharmamahayanasutra, one time Tathagatagunajnanacintyavisayavataranirdesa, one time Gaganaganjapariprcchasutra, one timeQuotes from Indian treatises or masters:Mahdydnasutralamkara, six times Madhyantavibhagatika, six times Mahdyanasamgraha, four times Vivrtagudharthapindavyakhya, three times Pancaskandhaprakaranavaibhasya, one time Parahitabhadra, six times Sajjana, four times"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Through CMW’s introduction, its above-mentioned explanation of the term “tantra” in Uttaratantra, and also in some other passages, the Uttaratantra is presented as a bridge between sütra and tantra, which is how this text is commonly considered in the Kagyii School. In particular, CMW says, among the seven vajra points, the basic element resembles the causal tantra; the means to purify it (awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity) resemble the method tantra; and the three jewels resemble the fruitional tantra.CMW emphasizes that the dharmadhatu or self-arisen wisdom exists right now in all sentient beings without exception and that there is no cut­off disposition. This self-arisen wisdom is not realized at present due to the two obscurations, which are however primordially nonexistent. Re­ferring to R G W s passage about “sound mind” and “unsound mind” in the Srïmâlâdevïsütray CMW says that “sound mind” refers to the wisdom of realizing luminosity, while “unsound mind” refers to the adventitious dependent1035 mind. Since these two are the remedy and what is to be re­linquished, respectively, they do not operate at the same time. Thus, like other Yogàcàra texts (such as the Mahâyânasamgraha), CMW basically speaks about an impure dependent nature that is ultimately nonexistent. For CMW equates the dependent nature here with the adventitious stains, which it explains throughout to be nonexistent. Similar to SM 9cd (“The suchness of the dhâtu is devoid of what is afflicted—the dependent”) and all the implications explained there, this also clearly suggests that, in terms of the relationship between the three natures in Yogàcàra, the perfect na­ture is empty of both the imaginary and the dependent natures (if the de­pendent nature is merely adventitious, the same goes even more for the imaginary nature). Obviously, all of these themes are discussed in great detail in later Shentong works.Generally, in its quotes and commentarial explanations, CMW exhibits a very strong and exclusive Yogàcàra underpinning (it does not refer to or quote any Madhyamaka works).1036 In particular, its discussion of the àlaya and its relation to the disposition is primarily based on the first chapter of the Mahâyânasamgraha (which is in line with the Third Karmapa s great re­liance on this chapter) and its commentary Vivrtagüdhârthapindavyàkhyà. According to Parahitabhadra, “the naturally abiding àlaya” is equivalent to the naturally abiding disposition, and “the adventitious àlaya” is equivalent to the unfolding disposition (thus, the unfolding disposition basically refers to the àlaya-consciousness’s progressively disappearing to the same extent that the naturally abiding àlaya or disposition becomes manifest).1037 InOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 305"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"306 Translators Introductiongeneral, the alaya functions as the basis of both contaminated and uncon­taminated phenomena. However, in the minds of sentient beings, though the uncontaminated seeds exist in the alaya, they do not exist substantially in it and thus are not able to directly produce manifest uncontaminated results, whereas the opposite is true for the contaminated seeds and their results. The uncontaminated seeds are not the primary seeds in the alaya but represent a minority in it, whereas the contaminated seeds represent a majority. Both coexist like water and milk in a single bowl as their basis. Through the path, the seeds of afflicted phenomena decrease, and the seeds of purified phenomena increase, just as geese are able to extract the essence (the milk) from the dross (the water). Until one focuses on the naturally abiding alaya through the remedy that is the path, the seeds of afflicted phenomena exist in it in the manner of adventitious stains, which are then purified through the path. R G W is said to actually refer to the disposition not only as the nature of phenomena but also as the uncontaminated seeds by speaking of the basic element as “the seed of the supramundane attri­butes.”1038 Thus, since the disposition and the alaya are the same, R G W is said to discuss this in detail.Being phrased throughout in classical Yogacara diction, this section of CMW is the clearest example of an early Tibetan commentary (based on the position of the Indian master Parahitabhadra) often explicitly combin­ing Yogacara teachings with those on buddha nature. This is exactly what later Tibetans such as the Third Karmapa, Dolpopa, and virtually all other Shentongpas did in great detail. In addition, just like later Shentongpas, CMW distinguishes between Yogacara and Mere Mentalism, saying that the tathagata heart is not an object of the Mere Mentalists who assert a re­ally existing self-awareness empty of apprehender and apprehended as the ultimate (which is contrasted with “the wisdom of ultimate emptiness”).Dashi Oser’s Heart o f the Luminous SunDiimo Dashi Oser was born in the late fifteenth century as the son of the chief of Diimo, an area in Drito,1039 in northeast Kham.1040 At a young age, he received the name Dashi Oser and a transmission for meditating on the mantra OM MANI PADME HUM from the Seventh Karmapa, Chotra Gyatso (1454-1506). Later, he was ordained as a novice by the First Gyaltsab Rinpoche, Baljor Tondrub1041 (1427-1489). Eventually, these two masters were to become Dashi Oser s principal teachers. He began studying basic monastic educational texts such as The Collected Topics1042 with some Gelugpa masters at the age of eight and later went to Central Tibet, where"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 307he trained in the Gelugpa approach to the sütra-based scriptures and the vajrayâna and became very learned in it. From the great abbot Chôdrub Sangpo,1043 he received his full monastic vows as well as various vajrayâna empowerments, such as Cakrasamvara, in the Sakya tradition.When he was on his way back to his homeland, he met the Seventh Kar­mapa in Namtokyi Riwo,1044 in Kongpo in southern Tibet. Uncontrollable devotion arose in him, and he discarded his plans to travel home, request­ing instead various instructions and transmissions of Mahâmudrâ, the Six Dharmas of Nàropa, Sarahas dohàs, several texts by the Third Karmapa (such as Pointing Out the Three Kâyas, The Nonduality ofPrâna and M ind, and The Profound Inner Reality), and many other teachings of sütra and tantra. He also received teachings from the Third Situpa, Dashi Baljor1045 (1498-1541). Dashi Oser practiced all of these diligently, and his realiza­tion is said to have become as vast as the sky. In that way, he became very learned in all major Tibetan scriptural traditions but remained mostly in solitary mountain retreats, during which he had visions of all the buddhas in the ten directions.Later, he taught various topics from the sütras and tantras, particularly at Surmang1046 Monastery, where he also received teachings in return. Even­tually, he became one of the four principal teachers of the Eighth Karmapa and widely instructed on The Profound Inner Reality, the Six Dharmas, Sar- aha s dohàs, and so on, in the Karmapa s nomad-style encampment. Mikyô Dorje considered him as a bodhisattva on the eighth bhümi and to be equal in kindness to his main teacher, the First Sangyé Nyenpa Rinpoche, Dashi Baljor (1457-1519). Later, Dashi Oser returned to Surmang to continue teaching, went into retreat again, and also founded a monastery in Rongwo Pengar.1047 Over the years, he gave many instructions in various places in eastern Tibet, always teaching solely the uncommon intention of the Kagyü lineage. Besides the Eighth Karmapa, his numerous disciples included the Third Gyaltsab Rinpoche, Tragba Baljor1048 (1519-1549).Except for the introduction and a few other passages, Dashi Oser s com­mentary (HLS) consists primarily of the Third Karmapa’s lost topical out­line of the Uttaratantra and mostly literal passages from R G W (which is quoted explicitly only once), including its sütra sources.1049 Just like RGW , the bulk of HLS s comments is on the first four vajra points. Thereafter, the text mostly just intersperses its outline with the verses of the Uttaratantra. The introduction provides a brief account of the role of Asanga and Vasu- bandhu in the transmission of the Maitreya works in India and how they were transmitted to the Kagyü lineage in Tibet. In its comments, HLS states"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"308 Translators Introductiona number of typical Kagyii positions on tathagatagarbha. For example, at the end of the first chapter, HLS discusses the positions on the nature of the tathagata heart in the Gelug, Sakya, and Kagyii schools, denying that it is just a nonimplicative negation or a teaching of expedient meaning. In particular, HLS s comments equate the tathagata heart with “alaya-wis- dom” and state that it exists, while mistaken appearances (the adventitious afflictions) are primordially nonexistent. Also, though awakening, which has the nature of the fundamental change, is a “result of freedom,” it per­forms the function of fulfilling ones own welfare and that of others. As for this “fundamental change,” “the foundation” refers to the sugata heart taught in the first chapter, while “its change” refers to the awakening of this sugata heart, its having become free from obscurations, which is taught in the second chapter.Rinchen Yesh^’s Light o f Definitive M eaningRinchen Yeshe, an expert on the five works of Maitreya, flourished in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and was primarily a teacher of Ngiilchu Togme1050 (1295-1369). He also briefly taught Dolpopa and is mentioned in Buton’s biography as an esteemed colleague. Rinchen Yeshe s commen­tary (RYC), which is not translated in its entirety here but only excerpted, follows the Indian style of lacking a topical outline and headings. Like most other commentaries on the Uttaratantra, it incorporates a great number of passages from R G W and (as its longer title indicates) quotes from many supporting sutras, some at great length (especially from the Dharanis­varardjasutra, the Ratnadarikasutra, and the Sarvabuddhavisayavatara- jhandlokdlarnkdrasutra). Rinchen Yeshe says that the reason for writing his commentary by matching it with the sutras is that other Tibetans who are renowned as scholars had composed commentaries on the Uttaratantra without having looked at the Indian sutras and thus accrued flaws in both words and meaning.It is interesting that RYC has been published in both the collected works of Kadampa masters and a series of Jonang works. As noted before, Buton is said to have referred to Rinchen Yeshe as the one whose philosophical system was later maintained by Dolpopa, who enhanced it greatly (this was my main reason to consult RYC in the first place). RYC does comment on the tathagata heart in positive terms and subscribes to the disclosure model (as do most commentaries on this text), and, like Dolpopa s main works, it abounds in sutra quotes (though it lacks tantric sources). In addition to these more general features, as mentioned above, RYC also contains some"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 309passages that can be read as being in accordance with Dolpopa’s later Shen- tong view (though RYC does not use Dôlpopa s specific terminologies). However, there are also several differences between Rinchen Yeshé and Dôlpopa, such as the formers asserting (like Ngog Lotsawa and others but unlike Dôlpopa) that all sentient beings are pervaded by the dharmakaya (or the three kàyas) as being suitable to be attained as the manifest kàyas and have the disposition of the manifest three kàyas as being suitable to be attained.Yeshé Dorje’s Jewel Treasure o f the Definitive M eaningYeshé Dorje Bal Sangpo1051 (born fourteenth century) from Minyag in Kham was a student of the Karma Kamtsang master Masé Dônpa Rinchen Sangpo1052 (1317-1383), the second Kangar1053 Lama. The latter is known as one of “the five learned ones from Minyag” and was a student of the Third and Fourth Karmapas, Dôlpopa, Butôn, and several Kadampa masters.Yeshé Dorjes commentary (YDC) is not translated in full here, but rele­vant excerpts are included as notes to the translations of R G W and CMW as well as in appendices 5 and 6. The colophon of Yeshé Dorjes text says that it was composed on the basis of the oral teachings by his guru and through bringing together many commentaries on the sütras of definitive meaning and numerous expositions composed by former masters. Accord­ingly, YDC quotes many sütras and also a great number of tantric sources (notably, it cites Nàgàrjunas Dharmadhâtustava several times). The com­mentary occasionally refers to the Sanskrit of the Uttaratantra, several times to differences in its translations by Nagtso Lotsàwa, Ngog Lotsàwa, Patsab Lotsàwa, and (once) a Lhotragpa Dharma Sengé, as well as frequently refer­ring to comments by Dôlpopa, Ngog Lotsàwa, Chaba Chôkyi Sengé, Bang Lotsawa1054 (1276-1342), and Masé Dônpa Rinchen Sangpo. Once, YDC also mentions the Third Karmapa.At the very end of YDC, there is a list of lineage gurus up through Ye­shé Dorjes own teacher (it is not clear whether this is Yeshé Dorjes own list). Interestingly, the list contains Maitreya, Asañga, Vasubandhu, Sthira- mati, Gayàdhara (994-1043),1055 Ratnavajra, and Sajjana on the Indian side, while all the figures on the Tibetan side, beginning with Ngog Lotsàwa as Sajjana s student, are Kadampa teachers—Shang Tsebong Chôkyi Lama,1056 Nyangtrenpa Chôkyi Yeshé,1057 Chaba Chôkyi Sengé,1058 Mawé Sengé,1059 Lotsàwa Sherab Dsôndrü,1060 a Lama Wengewa,1061 Chôbal Gyaltsen,1062 a Dashi Sengé,1063 and Masé Dônpa."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"310 Translators IntroductionYDC clearly subscribes to the disclosure model of buddha nature, as­serting that the stainless tathagata heart adorned with all major and minor marks as well as awakening exists in all beings, refuting that the reality of cessation is a nonimplicative negation, and denying the position that the fully qualified sugata heart exists solely on the buddhabhumi, while it is only nominal at the time of sentient beings. Also, besides CMW and Mi- phams commentary, YDC is the only other commentary I have reviewed that explicitly connects the name and contents of the Uttaratantra with the vajrayana notion of tantra, thus underlining the texts reputation as a bridge between the sutras and tantras. In addition, YDC’s concluding verses say that the Uttaratantra is far distant from extreme views and excellently teaches the supreme middle path free from reference points.YDC contains two interesting general presentations on the basic element and the purpose of teaching the tathagata heart (for details, see appendi­ces 5 and 6). The first one refutes several wrong views about the tathagata heart (such as its being mere awareness, a nonimplicative negation, or the skandhas) and elaborates on the natures of the naturally abiding and the unfolding dispositions. The second presentation begins by identifying the three dharma wheels by following the Dhdranisvararajasutra and then dis­tinguishes between what is of expedient meaning and of definitive mean­ing in these three according to the Samdhinirmocanasutra. The second dharma wheel is said to teach primarily the way in which the phenomena of which the basis of emptiness is empty do not exist, while the third wheel teaches mainly that basis of emptiness. Therefore, there is no inner contra­diction between these two dharma wheels. In particular, YDC refutes that the teaching on the tathagata heart is one that bears an intention because its claimed bases of intention are not tenable, its purpose is not established, and there is no invalidation of this teaching. Also, the emptiness taught in the buddha nature sutras and the Uttaratantra is not “the emptiness of ones being empty of something other,” which is said to be the worst kind of emptiness in the Lahkdvatdrasutray but corresponds to this sutra s “great ultimate emptiness of the wisdom of the noble ones.”1064 Finally, YDC de­nies that the Uttaratantra is a work that belongs to Mere Mentalism.Go Lotsawa’s Mirror That Clearly Shows True RealityGo Lotsawa is well known for his historical work The Blue Annals, and he also translated a number of works in the Tibetan canon.1065 Beginning his monastic training at age nine in a Kadampa monastery, he later studied with all of the important masters of his time, including the Indian Pandita"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 311Vanaratna (1384-1468), the Fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shegpa1066 (1384-1415), Rongton Sheja Gunsi, Tsongkhapa, and several Nyingma and Sakya teach­ers, thus becoming a master in all fields of Buddhist knowledge. He also was a teacher of the Seventh Karmapa, the Fourth Shamarpa, Chotra Ye­she (1453-1524), the Second Drugchen, Kunga Baljor1067 (1428-1476), and many others. Some of Go Lotsawas translations of Indian tantric works are found in the Tengyur, and it is said that his own collected writings once covered ten volumes. At present, only a few of his works are preserved— besides BA and GC, there are a biography of Vanaratna and a collection of Go Lotsawa s letters and statements to others.Despite his strong Kagyii affiliations, Go Lotsawa maintained a nonsec­tarian approach to all Buddhist schools throughout his life. For example, he received instructions on the six-branch yoga of the Kalacakratantra from both Vanaratna and Jonang masters, as well as on “the trilogy of bodhi- sattva commentaries” from the latter (both the six-branch yoga and these commentaries form the basis of the Jonang tantric Shentong approach). He was also advised by one of his early Kagyii teachers, Rimibabpa Sonam Rinchen (1362-1453), not to abandon either the Mahamudra or the Ge- lugpa views. This is also confirmed by the Eighth Karmapa s saying that Go Lotsawa accepted Tsongkhapas view as valid but also wished to uphold the tradition of the Tagpo Kagyii.1068 The colophon of Go Lotsawas commen­tary on the Uttaratantra (GC)1069 says that he explained this text based on(1) the exegetical tradition of Ngog Lotsawa, (2) Gampopa’s Mahamudra interpretation of the Uttaratantra, and (3) the explanations coming from Dsen Kawoche as well as the meaning of the three dharma wheels, both of which are in accordance with Mahamudra.1070 Thus, Go Lotsawa is another example of someone who explicitly combined Shentong and Mahamudra teachings (though the term shentong itself is absent from GC). Although Go Lotsawa at times agrees with Ngog Lotsawa on some more technical or scholastic points, there are also numerous differences, in particular his ex­planations of crucial passages of the Uttaratantra from a Mahamudra point of view and his denial that the tathagata heart is merely emptiness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation, while affirming rather that it is minds natural luminosity or basic awareness free from all reference points. In any case, GC does not mention Tsongkhapa or any typical Gelugpa interpreta­tions of buddha nature and the Uttaratantra.Go Lotsawas massive commentary (698 folios in dbu med; composed in 1473) is a commentary on both the Uttaratantra and R G W that contains many valuable explanations on a broad range of topics. A comprehensive"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"312 Translators Introductionsurvey or translation of this highly interesting work is beyond the scope of this study, but I use significant excerpts from GC throughout. The following is just a brief sketch of some major features of this commentary.1071 Similar to RYC, GC hardly uses the characteristic Tibetan outline system but fol­lows the Indian exegetical style of first quoting a portion of the text to be explained and then commenting on it. GC also retains the Indian division of RGVV into five chapters. Being an expert in Sanskrit, Go Lotsawa had access to a Sanskrit version of the text, which is obvious from occasional Sanskrit quotes of R G W as well as critical remarks on Ngog Lotsawas translation and comparisons with Nagtso Lotsawa’s. Indeed, many passages of the Uttaratantra and R G W quoted in GC correspond better to the cur­rently available Sanskrit version. GC also cites numerous mahayana sutras and treatises (both Yogacara and Madhyamaka), as well as tantric sources and the teachings of Indian and Tibetan siddhas, in particular Saraha, Mai- trlpa, his student Sahajavajra, and early Kagyii masters such as Gampopa and Lama Shang.However, it is surprising that GC does not cite many typical tathdgata- garbha sutras found in other commentaries. Among these sutras, GC mainly cites the SnmaladevTsutra but otherwise relies heavily on the Lahkd- vatarasutra (about sixty references and quotations, some of them lengthy). The Samdhinirmocanasutra as well as the other four Maitreya works be­sides the Uttaratantra are also quoted frequently, and Nagarjunas Dharma- dhatustava is represented by quoting about half of its 101 verses. As men­tioned above, Go Lotsawa s comments on some of these verses link them to Mahamudra and its key notion of ordinary mind.GC begins with paying homage to Maitreya, Maitrlpa, Dampa Sangy£, and Gampopa, and this is followed by a short introduction about the va­lidity of the teachings of the Buddha, the transmission of the five works of Maitreya in India and Tibet, and eight different ways of explaining the meaning of “tathagata heart” (see above). Thereafter, GC is divided into three main sections: (1) the brief explanation of the title for those of sharp­est faculties, (2) the explanation of the first three verses of the Uttaratantra for those of medium faculties, and (3) the explanation of the entire remain­der of the text for those of lesser faculties.1072GC says that, in general, the Uttaratantra teaches the meaning of all yanas and that all words of the Buddha are authentic. However, the pri­mary meaning of the Uttaratantra concerns the last or unsurpassable turn­ing of the wheel of dharma, and it also shows the difference between the expedient and the definitive meanings of the Buddhas words.1073 Uniquely"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"among all commentators on the Uttaratantra, Go Lotsawa explicitly links this text to the Mahamudra in the tradition of Maitrlpa, Sahajavajra, Gam- popa, and other Kagyu masters.1074 Following the hermeneutical approach of the Samdhinirmocanasutra, he says that the bhumis are completely per­fected only through the third dharma wheel but not through the second. The fruitional bhumis of the third dharma wheel are the last three pure bhumis, while those of the second wheel are only the bhumis up through the seventh.1075 Go Lotsawa also justifies the superiority of the third dharma wheel through the Mahamudra instructions of several Indian and Tibetan masters, which are primarily included in the detailed analysis of the seven vajra points in section (2) of GC. In addition, he explains that the four yogas of Mahamudra are contained in a hidden form in both the Lahkdva- tarasutra and the Uttaratantra. However, he also implies that in their being a gradual approach, even these four yogas are inferior to the actual realiza­tion of Mahamudra in an instantaneous manner because he says that this realization cannot be calculated in terms of different paths and bhumis.Besides establishing the connection of these four yogas with the Ut­taratantra directly as above, Go Lotsawa also includes them in his detailed comments on the Dharmadharmatavibhaga s entire section on the nature of phenomena that is included in GC.1076 As already stated above, he says that this section of the Dharmadharmatavibhaga represents a commentary on the fifth vajra point of the Uttaratantra.1077 For “stainless suchness” in the Uttaratantra corresponds to “the nature of phenomena” in the Dhar- madharmatavibhaga, with both texts explaining that stainless suchness consists of the fundamental change, whose cause is nonconceptual wis­dom. The conclusion of GC s comments on the Dharmadharmatavibhaga states that the distinction between the existent nature of phenomena (such­ness or mind’s luminosity) and nonexistent phenomena in this text matches the explanation in the Uttaratantra that the ultimately existent tathagata heart is empty of adventitious stains but not empty of buddha qualities.1078Thus, in both the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatavibhaga, the fundamental change indicates a primordial ultimate that is described in positive terms and is revealed by eliminating ultimately nonexistent adven­titious stains (as illustrated by the examples of primordially pure space, gold, and water). By extension, this also means that the section on phenom­ena in the Dharmadharmatavibhaga is a commentary on the adventitious stains as discussed in the Uttaratantra. Thus, the contents of these two texts are very closely related, which is also supported by the concluding part of Vasubandhus Dharmadharmatavibhagavrttis explaining the examples ofOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 313"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"314 Translators Introductionspace, gold, and water in the Dharmadharmatavibhaga as illustrating the manner in which there is a fundamental change in terms of permanent nat­ural luminosity, without this luminosity’s being changed in its own nature but only becoming free from adventitious stains.As mentioned above, GC compares several times the two different ap­proaches to meditation by Kamalaslla and Maitripa (analytical meditation versus direct realization of minds luminosity), with the latter s being said to be superior. In addition, GC s section on the four yogas of Mahamudra in relation to the Uttaratantra and the Lahkavatarasutra refers even to Atisas Madhyamakopadesa as well as Kamalasllas three Bhdvanakramas and his commentary on the Avikalpapravesadharanis saying that once all phenom­ena have been found to be nonexistent through analysis, one needs to rest in luminous nonconceptuality without mental engagement. In this vein, Go Lotsawa repeatedly states that the tathagata heart—basic awareness beyond affirmation and negation—is not a nonimplicative negation and that it can­not be found anywhere else than right within our own mental afflictions.Jamgon KongtruTs Lion's Roar of IrreversibilityThough this commentary (JKC) is the one that is used most widely in the Kagyii tradition at present, it is not translated in this volume for two rea­sons. First, except for its introduction (which incorporates a significant number of passages from BA and GC), JKC is for the most part an almost literal copy of Dolpopa s commentary on the Uttaratantra.1079 Interestingly, this commentary does not exhibit the strong Shentong approach so familiar from Dolpopas major other works (it probably was composed prior to the revelation that lead to the formulation of his Shentong view). Secondly, JKC has already been translated.1080 However, some relevant excerpts from this commentary are incorporated throughout this book.Instruction ManualsSix Texts by Kyoton Monlam TsliltrimMonlam Tsliltrim (1219-1299) was born in Dana1081 into the Kyoton clan. He received the entire corpus of Kadampa instructions from the seventh abbot of Nartang, Chim Namkatra (1210-1285).1082 Following that, he practiced Vajrapani in a place where he could not see the sun for eleven years and thus obtained great power, being able to dispel illnesses and evil spirits. In fact, he was considered as an emanation of Vajrapani. From 1285 until his death, he served as the eighth abbot of Nartang, and he also built a"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"great temple there. Besides the six brief texts discussed below, his preserved works include an incomplete commentary on the Abhisamayàlamkàra, brief guiding instructions on prajnâpâramitâ, a general commentary on Candrakïrti’s Prasannapadà, a brief commentary on Atisas Madhyamako- padesa, Instructions on Mahayana Madhyamaka, a brief lamrim text, several other brief guiding instructions (such as on Sântidevas Siksasamuccaya, Bodhicaryâvatâra, the Mahàyànasütràlamkàra, and bodhicitta accord­ing to Santideva), and several biographies. His students included Jom- den Rigpé Raltri (1227-1305), the ninth and the tenth abbots of Nartang, Nyima Gyaltsen1083 (c. 1225-1305) and Tragba Dsondrii1084 (1253-1316), and Séu Chôkyi Gyaltsen,1085 to whom most of the following six texts were transmitted.Instructions on uThe Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana”As for the transmission of the Uttaratantra, this text (IM) says that Maitripa (referred to as Maitreyanàtha), while staying in a monastery in Magadha, dreamt that he had put instructions on the Dharmadharmatàvibhàga and Uttaratantra in a four-storied sandalwood stüpa and then received point­ing-out instructions on them directly from Maitreya in that dream.1086 The next day, Maitripa found the instructions from his dream in a stüpa that he had circumambulated before.1087The actual instructions on the Uttaratantra in IM contain Maitreyas very direct pointing-out instructions on the nature of the mind, which are based on first making Maitripa recognize that he is dreaming and then us­ing his awareness of having a lucid dream. Generally, these pointing-out in­structions are very similar to pointing-out instructions in the Mahàmudrà tradition, repeatedly advising Maitripa to look directly at the essence of his thoughts and discover their nature as being luminous self-arisen wisdom. IM also uses some typical technical terms, such as “mind as such” (Tib. sems nyid), “beyond mind” (Tib. bio 'das), “connate ignorance” (Tib. lhan cigskyes pai ma rig pa), and “imaginary ignorance” (Tib. kun brtagspai ma rig pa) in the same way as they are explained in the Mahàmudrà teachings.In more detail, first,.Maitreya says that the Uttaratantra, which makes buddha nature a living experience, combines the triad of the cause (the tathagata heart), the conditions (awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity), and the results (the three jewels). In particular, he points out the tathagata heart through the inconceivability of the last four vajra points as described in Uttaratantra 1.24-25 in a very immediate experiential manner. This is followed by eight further guiding instructions closely based on theOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 315"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"3i6 Translators IntroductionUttaratantra. These instructions consist of identifying one’s own mind as a buddha, being mistaken as a sentient being through thoughts, there being no difference in terms of the benefit of natural luminosity during its three phases (in sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas), trusting that the guru who points out luminous self-arisen wisdom is a buddha, discussing the scriptural passages on the first three vajra points that are the results, discussing the naturally pure basic element that is the luminous dharma- dhatu, being free from the stains of adventitious thoughts (which discusses the last three vajra points), and explaining great nonconceptual wisdom (which mainly consists of a discussion of the five flaws to be counteracted by teaching the tathagata heart).These pointing-out instructions also contain typical Yogacara elements, such as an explanation of the eight consciousnesses that echoes the one in verse 9 of Vasubandhu’s Trisvabhavanirdesa and the equation of samsara with adventitious thoughts, which are nothing but the adventitious stains of mind’s luminosity. These teachings also refer to the vajrayana instruc­tions on “fourfold luminosity” (for details, see below). In typical vajrayana and Mahamudra fashion, the guru is identified as being equal to a buddha due to being the key person who directly points out the nature of one’s mind.Furthermore, in agreement with the Uttaratantra, IM equates the tathagata heart with mind’s ultimate true nature, mind s natural luminosity, self-arisen nonconceptual wisdom, buddhahood, and the dharmakaya, all of which are said to exist already in sentient beings, but are merely ob­scured by imaginary adventitious stains. This is also fully in line with the Avatamsakasutra's example of comparing the immeasurable buddha qual­ities within the mind streams of ordinary beings to a huge silk cloth with a painting of the universe inside a minute particle (see RGVV on 1.25). Needless to mention, all of this is in accord with the Shentong view.Interestingly, IM also specifies that its instructions are very advanced teachings that should not be pointed out to four kinds of people: (1) those who cling to the illusionary appearances of samsara as being real (those with great desire), (2) those who cling to the skandhas as being a real self (tlrthikas), (3) those who do not realize great bliss within samsara and thus abandon it for their own benefit (sravakas), and (4) those who lack the compassion that benefit others (pratyekabuddhas). These four correspond to the ones that are identified as not being able to realize the tathagata heart in Uttaratantra I.32-33ab and R G W . This shows clearly that IM does not explain away positive descriptions of the ultimate as being teachings with"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"only provisional meaning but takes them as definitive instructions for the most advanced practitioners on the Buddhist path.The Repository o f WisdomGiven its unique title and its contents, there is no doubt that this text (RW) is identical with the text of the same name (Ye shes kyi bzhagsa) mentioned in BA in the context of the early transmission of the five texts of Mai- treya above. Just as IM, RW was given to Séu Chokyi Gyaltsen but seems to represent Monlam Tsiiltrim s own oral instructions (for the most part in the form of questions and answers) that are based on the lineage of Dsen Kawoché and the Uttaratantra. Similar to IM, the style and contents of RW conform with both the Shentong view and direct Mahàmudrà instructions on realizing adventitious confusion, thoughts, and afflictions as mind’s nat­ural luminosity, that is, self-arisen nonconceptual wisdom.In line with what Dsen Kawoché is reported to have said to Sajjana about why he wishes to study the works of Maitreya, RW begins by declaring that the texts of Maitreya are the ones into which one should put one’s trust when making a teaching one’s “death dharma.” In particular, the Ut­taratantra is said to be Maitreya’s instruction on true actuality, which is contained in the texts seven vajra points. This is followed by describing buddha, dharma, and samgha (the first three vajra points) based on the corresponding verses of the Uttaratantra, but explaining them primarily in terms of mind’s luminosity and self-arisen nonconceptual wisdom.Next, the text speaks about the fourth vajra point—the basic element— versus the adventitious stains that obscure it. Interestingly, a “sentient be­ing” is equated here with these obscurations, which consist of thoughts or conceptions (in the widest sense of this term as the all-pervasive and un­ceasing activity of samsâric mind constructing its own world in terms of subject-object appearances). Mind’s natural luminosity is unchanging and beyond any need for purification or remedy, and the mahayana is explained from an internal perspective as the union of prajnâ and compassion within this luminosity. The two types of disposition—the naturally abiding dis­position and the accomplished disposition—are defined respectively as the unconditioned dharmakàya and the weariness of samsara that is the seed for realizing the luminosity that is the naturally abiding disposition. Ulti­mately, there are no beings with “cut-off disposition,” since this term refers only to the lack of faith in the mahayana in certain beings.As for the fifth vajra point, the text defines the dharmakàya as mind’s natural purity’s having become pure of all stains of thought. What is calledOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 317"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"318 Translators Introduction“buddha wisdom” refers to the realization of the actuality that is inexpress­ible and inconceivable by the stains of thought. This wisdom of buddhas is said to know what appears to sentient beings through wisdom (realizing the luminosity of the minds of these beings to be as pure as their own) as well as compassion (realizing that the adventitious stains of these beings are ac­tually nonexistent). In this way, buddhas are able to promote the welfare of sentient beings through wisdom and compassion (the seventh vajra point). The sixth vajra point is touched upon later by mentioning the major and minor marks of the two rüpakäyas.The text says that when meditating in the tradition of Maitreya, there are two ways of thoughts disintegrating, which never mix—either through analyzing how characteristics of having an intrinsic nature appear and what their actual nature is or without depending on meditating on an im­age that appears in the mind.Both rüpakäyas are explained as being nothing but appearances of im­ages of samadhi and wisdom in those to be guided. Through gaining cer­tainty that they are appearances of ones own mind, on the bhümis, they appear as sambhogakäyas. When apprehended as independently existing buddhas outside of ones mind, they appear as nirmänakäyas.The text denies the existence of any external objects—all appearances are appearances of ones own thoughts.Elaborating on the difference between ordinary beings and bodhisat­tvas, our text explains that the former cling to the real existence of the conceptions that obscure their buddha nature, while bodhisattvas realize all appearances to be illusion-like. Since ordinary beings do not recognize appearances for the illusions that they are, they lack altruistic compassion. Since bodhisattvas recognize the clinging to real existence as luminosity, their realizations are not just realizations for their own benefit (as in sra­vakas and pratyekabuddhas). This also means that pure buddha realms such as Sukhävatl are experienced by them right here and now, while such realms are obscured in ordinary beings.The text separates ultimate reality and seeming reality, saying that self­arisen wisdom exists, while thoughts and their objects (adventitious stains) do not exist. The ultimate is equated with buddhahood and the seeming is equated with sentient beings. Furthermore, from what RW says in different places, seeming reality is also equated with adventitious stains and thoughts, while ultimate reality is equivalent to the dharmakaya and nonconceptual wisdom free from adventitious stains or thoughts. Still, the text also says that “the essence of thoughts is self-arisen wisdom—the dharmadhätu,”"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 319that “at the time of realizing their luminosity, thoughts are self-arisen wis­dom—the dharmakàya,” and “from the perspective of a buddha [even] a single subtle thought in itself is [wisdom].” Such statements are obviously equivalent to the Kagyii Mahâmudrà hallmark “the essence of thoughts is dharmakàya.” At first glance, this seems to be an assertion of both Dôlpo­pa s separation of ultimate and seeming reality and the Kagyii Mahàmudrà approach (thus not following Dôlpopa s critique of this approach by strictly separating the two realities and saying that the permanent ultimate beyond the three times cannot be the nature of what is adventitious and imperma­nent). However, as mentioned before, since all phenomena of seeming re­ality are not really existent in the first place (and Dôlpopa and Mahàmudrà agree on this), there is always only one ultimately real phenomenon to be­gin with, which is buddha nature or mind’s natural luminosity. Therefore, there is only a single actual reality, and thus any presentation of two sepa­rate realities is necessarily of expedient meaning.Just like the Eighth Karmapa’s Lamp, RW says that the existence of self-arisen wisdom is beyond the reach of Madhyamaka because Madhya- maka dismantles only the conditioned adventitious stains of this wisdom through stopping the clinging to their real existence.IM also brings up the question about the difference between the self-awareness of Mere Mentalism and self-arisen wisdom, if that wisdom is said to exist. In reply, the text says that the assertion of all appearances’ being appearances of thoughts accords with Mere Mentalism. Here, how­ever, it is held that when the luminosity of thoughts is realized, they are self-arisen wisdom—the dharmakàya. All of this accords with the typical Shentong distinction between Mere Mentalism and Shentong in terms of the final word’s being the ultimate existence of mind versus the ultimate existence of nonconceptual or self-arisen wisdom.Throughout, RW says that self-arisen wisdom exists primordially and that it just needs to be made manifest with all its qualities through seeing its adventitious obscurations for what they are—mere illusion-like thoughts without any real existence. This is said to be similar to the removal of dross from a precious gem. As for the progressive process of removing or rather liberating thoughts, the thoughts of ordinary beings are liberated through the thoughts of sràvakas, while those of the latter are liberated through the thoughts of bodhisattvas. Finally, all thoughts of bodhisattvas dissolve through being liberated as uncreated buddha wisdom."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"320 Translators IntroductionThe Heart o f the Matter o f LuminosityThis brief work (HML) ascertains ones own mind as luminosity by way of (1) this luminosity’s abiding as buddhahood, (2) the purification of its adventitious stains of thought, and (3) the manner in which the tathagata heart dawns as wisdom. It follows the Uttaratantra in presenting (1) lumi­nous mind (the tathagata heart) through its threefold meaning (the dhar- makâya, suchness, and the disposition), its nine examples in relation to the three kâyas and the nine types of obscurations, and its ways of being pres­ent in ordinary beings, noble ones, and buddhas. (2) The purification of the adventitious stains of thought consists of (a) taking refuge in the dhar- makàya (the result), (b) familiarizing with the naturally pure basic element (the cause), and (c) dwelling on the path (the condition). Unfortunately, the last two pages of this text, which cover most of points (2) and (3), are missing, but more information related to these two points can be gleaned from IM and RW.Pith Instructions on the Wisdom at the Point o f Passing when about to DieThis short text (PIW) relies on the Atyantajnânasütra for its Mahamudra instructions at the moment of death. It says that one needs to understand that all appearances as well as mind are not really existent and are unfind- able, and then one needs to settle within the state of nonconceptuality. Thus, the nonconceptuality that abides as the natural state and the noncon­ceptuality of meditation meet like mother and child, through which one will attain Mahamudra in the intermediate state.Guiding Instructions on the Path o f the Nature o f PhenomenaThis text says that it presents a summary of the pith instructions on the path according to the intention of Maitreya, consisting of the founda­tion of the path, the way of being mistaken in the form of samsara, the stages of the path arising in the mind stream, and the manner in which buddha wisdom arises.1088 The foundation of the path is the disposition that is mind’s natural luminosity. Those who are said to lack the dispo­sition are explained according to Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra III.ll. Accord­ing to Uttaratantra 1.41, in those who have the dispositions of srâvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and the mahàyàna, weariness of samsara and striving for nirvana arise from the disposition. The remainder of the text follows the outline of the Dharmadharmatavibhaga and is essentially a summary of that text with some additional comments. At the time of the fruition, since"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 321the nature of phenomena is free from stains, pure mind is buddhahood— this is the nature of phenomena’s having seized its own ground (rang sa zin pa). There are three ways buddha wisdom arises. Since its essence is free from the stains of thoughts, all knowable objects appear as the nature of phenomena—appearances are the dharmakàya (this is certainly rem­iniscent of the Kagyü Mahàmudrà hallmark “the essence of thoughts is dharmakàya”). To teach the dharma to others is the sambhogakâya and to attain mastery over the mind is the nirmànakâya.1089 Enlightened activity is presented as in the Uttaratantra through its two main features of being without thoughts and being uninterrupted. Since the nature of phenomena has seized its own ground,1090 it does not arise through thoughts. Since the nature of phenomena is permanent, the stream of its own wisdom is unin­terrupted. Also, since the dharmadhâtu abides as the essence of a body of wisdom and since mastery over appearances is attained, the realization of the three kàyas increases.The colophon of this text presents the following transmission lineage up to Monlam Tsliltrim—Maitreya, Ratnàkarasànti, Sajjana, Su Gawé Dorje, Purangpa Chenpo,1091 Dôlpa,1092 Trelhepa,1093 uncle and nephew Chepa,1094 and a certain Shangpa.1095The Essential Pith Instructions That Summarize the Quintessence of the PitakasThis instruction1096 was given by Monlam Tsiiltrim at the request of two Geshés, Gônden Ô1097 and Yonten Ô.1098 It explains the paths of the three types of individuals of lesser, medium, and highest capacities. In the con­text of the latter, we find Mahàmudrà-style instructions and a quotation from the Uttaratantra. These instructions begin by saying that one should cut through thoughts of the three times—not following the past, not antic­ipating the future, and relaxing and settling the present mind. For thoughts are the cause of samsara, while nonthought is the cause of nirvana. In par­ticular, one needs to cut through all outer reference points in terms of be­ing real and delusive and look at the essence of the mind inside. Through that, a mind to look at is not seen and thus the looker naturally is at peace, relaxes, and settles. It is taught that the mind was not seen, is not seen, and will not be seen by the buddhas of the three times. The nature of the mind is primordially luminous. Since this luminous and empty mind is the dharmakàya, if one realizes it as it is, one will be liberated. As the sütras say, “The nature of the mind is luminosity.” Uttaratantra I.154cd states:"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"322 Translators IntroductionActual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.Though this luminous and naturally empty mind exists intrinsically within one, one wanders in samsara due to not knowing this. The means to put an end to this wandering are that ones guru demonstrates the true nature of ones mind as it is. Through that, one sees that the preceding moment of mind is no more after it has ceased, the next one is not there either as it has not arisen yet, and if one searches for the present one, it is without abiding. Nor does one find any shape, color, or essence of this present moment of the mind, but it is empty and transparent. Then, one relaxes and settles within that state. If one rests in that way, one realizes that one had tainted ones own natural condition before. During subsequent attainment, out of the state of realizing that everything lacks real existence, one solely engages in activities for the welfare of others and dedicates all this to great awakening in a nonreferential manner.In sum, CMW as well as Monlam Tsiiltrim s texts are important works in that they shed new light on both the contents and the transmission of the early meditative tradition of the Uttaratantra. In that vein, the combi­nation of Mahamudra pointing-out instructions with all the vajra points of the Uttaratantra in CMW, IM, and RW supports Gampopas famous state­ment “The text for this Mahamudra of ours is the Mahaydnottaratantra- sdstra.” All of these texts are evidence for the existence of a sutra-based Mahamudra approach and also for the compatibility of the Shentong view and Mahamudra. Gampopas statement and the existence of correspond­ing Mahamudra instructions in CMW and all the texts by Monlam Tsiil­trim show that such teachings must have existed earlier in India (at least from the tenth century onward) and Tibet. It is also noteworthy that the transmission of Monlam Tsiiltrim s works proves that the lineage of the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatavibhaga according to the tradition of Sajjana, Su Gawe Dorje, and Dsen Kawoche continued at least into the fourteenth century and that it was part of the Kadampa tradition, which at that time clearly represented mainstream Tibetan Buddhism. Whether the early Kagyii lineage holders, such as Gampopa and the First and Third Kar- mapas, received teachings of the type found in Monlam Tsiiltrim s works during their extensive studies in the Kadampa tradition is not certain, but it is very likely."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 323Milcyo Dorje’s Lamp That Excellently Elucidates the System o f the Proponents o f ShentongM adhyam akaInterestingly, despite its title, the term shentong never occurs in this work. In its own words, its topic is “the meaning of the two realities [according to] the dharma principles that derive from the levels of yogic pursuit,” which indicates that the Eighth Karmapa wrote his text from the perspective of the direct realization of ultimate reality. Indeed, despite its occasional ref­utations of wrong views, the Lamp is primarily not a polemical text but largely an instruction to be contemplated. Thus, its multilayered meanings come to the fore only when read several times, reflecting on each sentence and also consulting the materials in the notes.1099In terms of its contents, the Lamp represents a digest of the Uttaratantra, discussing its seven vajra points. In particular, the texts structure closely follows the first chapter of the Uttaratantra and RGVV, explaining the first four vajra points in detail. Thus, the Lamp refers to both the Uttaratantra and RGVV throughout, though each one is only quoted explicitly once. In addition, the text cites the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta, the Avatamsakasutra, and the Mahdydnasutrdlamkarabhasya (once each). It also refers to the Dharmadharmatavibhaga, the Madhyantavibhaga, the Kalacakratantra, and six verses from the Dharmadhatustava.The Lamp's presentation of the vajra points of the Uttaratantra is re­peatedly contrasted with the limited views on emptiness or ultimate reality of those Madhyamikas who do not understand the “Great Madhyamaka” of Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu. Those Madhyamikas include Can- draklrti, Haribhadra, and other Indians and Tibetans “who flatter them­selves as being Madhyamikas.” In particular, the Lamp repeatedly denies that merely not finding phenomena as either existent, nonexistent, both existent and nonexistent, or neither existent nor nonexistent under analysis through Madhyamaka reasoning does not represent the true seeing of ulti­mate reality. The Karmapa also denies that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas realize phenomenal identitylessness.Despite never using the term shentong, the Lamp does advance some classical Shentong positions, such as the perfect natures being empty of both the imaginary and the dependent natures. The text says that the ad­ventitious stains to be relinquished consist of both the imaginary and the dependent natures, while what is to be adopted is the tathagata heart (which is thus implicitly equated with the perfect nature). Throughout, the text fol­lows the disclosure model of buddha natures existing with all its qualities"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"324 Translators Introductionprimordially and only needing to be revealed through realizing that the ad­ventitious stains are ultimately nonexistent. In that vein, the Lamp says that through the reality and the blessing of the unconditioned tathàgata heart and of the natural purity of the dharmadhâtu, initially and seemingly, it is the conditioned adventitious stains (and not the tathàgata heart) that, while actually always being nonexistent, become weary of suffering and aspire for nirvana. Later, it is through the light of wisdom arising from the tathàgata heart itself that these adventitious stains are actually overcome. That is, through self-arisen wisdoms looking at the adventitious stains of its own continuum, no attributes or bearers of attributes, which make up the ad­ventitious stains, are to be seen. At that point, through this wisdom s being free from all stains, it manifests true actuality just as it is.At the same time, the Eighth Karmapa s Shentong view is often char­acterized by the Kagyii School as representing “expanse Shentong”1100 as opposed to “wisdom Shentong”1101 or “luminosity Shentong.”1102 The latter means that the wisdom of buddha nature is empty of adventitious stains (the “other”) and that this wisdom itself is not empty but really existent as the ultimate nature of luminosity. Thus, this approach emphasizes the luminous nature of the mind and its innate buddha qualities (typical pro­ponents are Dôlpopa and his followers, including Jamgôn Kongtrul Lodrô Tayé). “Expanse Shentong” means that buddha natures wisdom itself is free from any reference points, which emphasizes the space-like quality of minds nature. This approach, which is highlighted by the Lamp's frequent use of the word “expanse” in connection with, or as a synonym for, the tathàgata heart, is also predominant in the sections of the Eighth Karma- pas commentary on the Abhisamayàlamkàra that discuss Shentong and in the writings of the Sixth Shamarpa, Chôkyi Wangchug.1103The Lamp also contains some Mahàmudrà elements, such as speak­ing several times of instantaneous awakening or buddhahood, the dhar- makàyas being nothing but self-aware wisdom realizing itself, the knots of discriminating thinking being undone, and the power of yoga, without thinking, relinquishing all improper conceptions.Jamgôn KongtruTs Guiding Instructions on the View o f Great Shentong M adhyam akaJamgôn Kongtruls GISM begins by identifying the general sources of Shentong as the sütras of the third turning as well as the works of Mai­treya, Nàgàrjuna, Asañga, their successors, Su Gawé Dorje, Dsen Kawoché, the Third Karmapa, Dôlpopa, Longchenpa, the Seventh Karmapa, Sàkya"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Overview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 325Chogden, Târanàtha, the Eight Situpa, the Thirteenth Karmapa, and the Ninth Situpa. Among the two sources of guiding instructions on the view, die specific source of the instructions in GISM is said to be Maitrlpa s tradi­tion with its emphasis on the intended meaning of the Uttaratantra> which was further transmitted through Ratnavajra, Sajjana, and so on. This ap­proach corresponds to what Jamgon Kongtrul calls “sütra Mahamudra ’ in his TOK (see above). However, in accordance with Dôlpopa and his follow­ers, GISM also speaks about the vajrayana aspect of the Shentong system by presenting the completion stage practice of the Kâlacakratantra as mainly transmitted in the Jonang tradition. The second source of guiding instruc­tions on the view is identified by GISM as the well-known Kagyii approach of Marpa—the uncommon Mahamudra of the union of sütra and tantra.The structure of the actual guiding instructions in GISM thus consists of (1) the sütra approach and (2) the tantra approach. (1) The sütra ap­proach is discussed in two parts: (a) what is to be understood (the two ap­proaches of the Nihsvabhàvavàdins and the Yogàcàras) and (b) the actual practice. The practice consists of the preliminaries (contemplating the four seals in accordance with the first turning of the wheel of dharma) and the main practice. The latter has three parts: refuge and bodhicitta, resting in freedom from reference points in accordance with the second turning, and pointing out and distinguishing existence, nonexistence, and so on, in ac­cordance with the third turning and the vajrayana based on calm abiding and superior insight. (2) The vajrayana approach consists of two parts: (a) what is to be understood and (b) the main practice (the six-branch yoga of the Kâlacakratantra). The text concludes with presenting the benefit of these instructions and practices as well as a brief account of the Shentong lineage through the Jonang tradition and its transmission to the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.In this vein, it is noteworthy that Jamgon Kongtrul wrote his GISM at the main seat of the Jonang lineage in Dzamtang after having received teachings from the Jonang lineage holder Ngawang Chôpel Gyatso (c. 1788-1865), the teacher of the famous Bamda Tubten Gelé Gyatso (1844- 1904). Generally speaking, Jamgon Kongtruls works, as represented by the contents and the Shentong lineage in GISM as well as the discussions of Shentong in TOK, present a Shentong system that is an eclectic blend of what could be called “Kagyü Shentong” (primarily based on Maitrlpa, the Third and Seventh Karmapas, and the Eighth and Ninth Situpas) and “Jonang Shentong” (based on Dôlpopa and especially Târanàtha), as well as some elements of Sàkya Chogdens Shentong."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"326 Translators IntroductionSimilar to several of Mônlam Tsültrims texts, both the contents and terminology of GISM s sütra approach accord not only with Shentong but also very much with Mahàmudrà instructions. Synonyms for mind’s nature include the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects, natural luminos­ity, Mahàmudrà, and the tathàgata heart. This tathàgata heart is the basis of all appearances of samsàra and nirvâna and, at present, is the self-aware wisdom that is lucid and unceasing. GISM speaks about “mental nonen­gagement” and meditating in the manner of not meditating. It refers to the triad of minds stillness, movement, and awareness and that it is essential to recognize naked awareness in anything that the mind may appear as. All appearances and experiences are said to be self-arising and self-liberated, without ever tainting the essence of this awareness. Thus, there is nothing to meditate on apart from solely recognizing this basic nature. The text also speaks about “searching for the mind”—the common Mahàmudrà ap­proach of cultivating superior insight through searching for any essence or characteristics of the still mind and whether it is different from the moving mind. GISM even mentions two among the four deviations from emptiness that are taught in Mahàmudrà (“deviating from emptiness by mistaking it as the path” and “deviating from emptiness as the fundamental ground of all knowable objects”). In addition, the text also contains many Yogàcàra elements, such as the eight consciousnesses and the imaginary nature of the adventitious stains.As for establishing the scriptural connections between sütra Shentong, Mahàmudrà, and the Uttaratantra, GISM quotes the Sthiràdhyàsayapari- vartasütra on the ultimate three jewels and then uses crucial verses from the Uttaratantra to cover the remaining four vajra points (the sequence of all seven is presented through Uttaratantra 1.3). The fourth vajra point is covered by Uttaratantra 1.28 (all sentient beings possess buddha nature), 1.37-38 (the four pàramitàs), I.51cd (its changeless nature), 1.96-97 (the nine examples), and 1.154-55 (the natural absence of obscurations and the intrinsic qualities of the tathàgata heart). The fifth vajra point is discussed through II.3 and 11.38 (the characteristics of awakening), II.5 (awakening as possessing all buddha qualities). The sixth vajra point is covered by III.l (the sixty-four qualities), and the seventh is covered by IV. 1 (the charac­teristics of enlightened activity). The benefit is explained by referring to V.3-6, and the dedication consists of V.25. In this way, GISM highlights the essential points in all of the chapters of the Uttaratantra. The text also quotes Mahàyànasütràlamkàra VI.8 and Lankàvatàrasütra X.256-57 on"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"the four yogic practices. In addition, it repeatedly recommends studying Dolpopa’s Mountain Dharma: The Ocean o f the Definitive Meaning.In sum, though they show many overlaps and together cover a wide range of the contents of the Uttaratantra, the contemplative instructions on the Uttaratantra in SM, CMW’s introduction, Monlam Tsiiltrim’s texts, the Lamp, and GISM also differ in either style or some of their contents. SM is far more theoretical than all the other works here, mainly focusing on the three natures (the dharmakàya, suchness, and the disposition) and the ten topics of explaining the tathàgata heart as the objects of reflection and meditation. At the same time, SM provides numerous explicit and implicit cross-references between several topics within primarily the fourth vajra point (such as the nine examples and the nine afflictions), which are also presented as contemplative templates. SM lacks the Mahàmudrà-like style of direct pointing-out instructions that is so pervasive in all the other above texts (though the Lamp does not exhibit that style as much as the others).CMWs introduction includes all seven vajra points but mainly focuses on pointing-out instructions on the three natures in a style that is usually found in the Mahàmudrà and Dzogchen traditions.The general theme in Monlam Tsiiltrim’s works and GISM is that bud­dhahood is nothing but the natural luminosity of ones own mind and that all obscuring thoughts are merely adventitious stains that need to be seen through. Like CMW, those texts largely couch this theme in pointing-out instructions in Mahàmudrà style. In particular, IM discusses this theme through touching upon the contents of all seven vajra points, the incon­ceivability of the last four, and the five flaws and their opposites. RW treats it primarily through referring to the first five vajra points. GISM presents its Mahàmudrà instructions by quoting several key verses from all seven vajra points (though mainly focusing on the fourth one) as the direct objects of contemplation.The Lamp is largely a digest of the presentation of the fourth vajra point in the Uttaratantra and RGVV, with occasional polemics against Indian and Tibetan “pseudo-Màdhyamikas.” Nevertheless, its tone is mostly con­templative in nature and requires deeper reflection in order to appreciate its profound points.In conclusion, it seems worth noting that despite the great importance of the Uttaratantra in the Kagyii School, there are only six known Kagyii commentaries (plus the Third Karmapa s outline) on the text. Among them, three (those by Karma Gôncho Shônnu, the first Karma Trinlépa, and Sur- mang Lhalungpa) are lost. HLS is essentially a combination of the ThirdOverview o f the Indian and Tibetan Texts in This Book 327"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"328 Translators IntroductionKarmapas outline with excerpts from RGW , plus a few brief and more typical Kagyii paragraphs on tathagatagarbha. Except for its introduction (which includes passages from BA and GC), JKC closely follows Dolpopa. That leaves only Go Lotsawa’s commentary as an actual Kagyii commentary on the Uttaratantra. Still, even among Kagyii commentaries, GC appears to be unique in a number of ways, such as when it agrees with Ngog Lotsawa and in its particular Mahamudra interpretation of the Uttaratantra that is in turn greatly based on the Lahkavatarasutra.If one looks for truly indigenous Kagyii works on the Uttaratantra (though not actual commentaries) besides GC, one needs to turn to the Eighth Karmapas Lamp and especially to the Third Karmapas Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart (essentially a digest of the Uttaratantra) with Jamgon Kongtruls commentary. In a wider sense, as works that discuss tathaga- tagarbha in detail, one may include the Third Karmapas commentary on the Dharmadhatustava, the first chapter of his Profound Inner Reality with its auto commentary, and the commentaries on this chapter by several au­thors, in particular, the first Karma Trinlepa, Tagbo Rabjampa Chogyal Denba1104 (1449-1524), and Jamgon Kongtrul.1105"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Translations"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Ratnagotravibhaga Mahayanottaratantrasastra—An Analysis of the Jewel Disposition, A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the MahayanaOra namah Sri Vajrasattvaya—Om I pay homage to Glorious Vajrasattva1106Buddha, dharma, assembly, basic element,Awakening, qualities, and finally buddha activity—The body of the entire treatise Is summarized in these seven vajra points. 1.1{P75a} “Vajra point”1107 refers to the footing or locus of the actuality of the realization that is like a vajra.

Those [sentient beings] with various causal natures [of enter­ing this domain] who enter it all together and realize the true nature of a tathagata are called “unsurpassable venerable ones.”1143Having in mind the pure disposition, the tathagata element, it is said:Just as within stony debris Pure gold is not seen,And then becomes visible through being purified,Tathâgatas [become visible] in the world.1144Now, what are those sixty kinds of factors of purifying the buddha element? They are the four kinds of ornaments of bodhisattvas,1145 the eight kinds of illuminations of bodhisattvas,1146 the sixteen kinds of the great compassion of bodhisattvas,1147 and the thirty-two kinds of the activity of bodhisattvas.1148After the discussion of that, [the sütra] explains buddha awakening through teaching the sixteen kinds of the great compassion of great awak­ening.1149 Following the discussion of that, the buddha qualities are ex­plained through teaching the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha.1150 {P78a} After the discussion of that, buddha activity is explained through teaching the thirty-two kinds of the unsurpassable activity of a buddha.1151 In this way, the seven vajra points should be understood in detail by way of discussing their specific characteristics according to the [Dhâranïsvararâjajsütra. {D77b}W hat is the connection between these [seven points]? {J7}From the Buddha [comes] the dharma and from the dharma, the noble samgha.Within the samgha, the [tathagata] heart leads to the attainment of wisdom.The attainment of that wisdom is the supreme awakening that is endowed withThe attributes such as the powers that promote the welfare of all sentient beings. 1.3This describes the connection of [the seven vajra points in] the treatise.1152"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE THREE JEWELS AND THE TATHAGATA HEART[Now,] the meaning of these verses is to be explained. Those sentient be­ings who are guided by the Tathagata, having taken refuge in the Tathagata, also take refuge in the dharma and the samgha due to their openness that is the natural outflow of the nature of phenomena. Therefore, first [there is] a verse on the jewel of the Buddha.You awakened to peaceful buddhahood without beginning, middle, or end.Upon your self-awakening, you taught the fearless everlasting path so that the unawakened may awake.I pay homage to you who wield the supreme sword and vajra of wisdom and compassion, cut the sprouts of suffering to pieces,And break through the wall of doubts concealed by the thicket of various views. 1.4What is taught by this?Being unconditioned, effortless,Not being produced1153 through other conditions,And possessing wisdom, compassion, and power,Buddhahood is endowed with the two welfares. 1.5This [verse] describes buddhahood in brief as consisting of eight qualities. What are these eight qualities? They are being unconditioned, effortless, an awakening not through other conditions, {P78b} wisdom, compassion, power,1154 the fulfillment of ones own welfare, and the fulfillment of the welfare of others. {J8}It is unconditioned because its nature Is to be without beginning, middle, and end.It is declared to be effortlessBecause it possesses the peaceful dharm a body.11551.6337"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"338 TranslationsIt is not produced through other conditions Because it is to be realized personally. {D78a}Thus, it is wisdom because it is threefold awakening.It is compassion because it teaches the path. 1.7It is power because it overcomes sufferingAnd the afflictions through wisdom and compassion.One’s own welfare is by virtue of the first three qualities And the welfare of others by virtue of the latter three. 1.8Being “unconditioned” should be understood as the opposite of being conditioned. Here, what is called “conditioned” is that in which arising is perceived and abiding and ceasing are perceived too. Because of the lack of these [three characteristics], buddhahood is to be regarded as being without beginning, middle, and end and as consisting of the unconditioned dharmakaya. It is effortless because all reference points and conceptions are at peace.It is not produced by other conditions because it is to be realized byself-arisen wisdom (here, udaya means “awakening” and not “arising”).1156 Even though it is unconditioned and has the characteristic of being inac­tive, from tathagatahood all activities of the perfect Buddha unfold with­out effort in an unimpeded and uninterrupted manner until the end of samsara. Thus, buddhahood, which is a truly amazing and inconceivable object, is completely and perfectly realized as being inexpressible in nature by [the Buddha] himself, [that is,] not after having heard [about it] from others, but through the self-arisen wisdom that is not caused by a master. Thereafter, in order to help awaken1157 others, who have not awakened to such an awakening {P79a} and are blind by birth,1158 [the Buddha] teaches them the path that leads to that [awakening].1159 Therefore, one should un­derstand that [the Buddha] is endowed with unsurpassable wisdom and compassion.The fearlessness of the path is due to its being beyond the world. Its being beyond the world is due to its never turning back. In due order, the examples of a sword and a vajra elucidate that both the wisdom and com­passion of the Tathagata have the power to overcome the roots of the suf­fering and the afflictions of others. Here, in brief, the root of suffering consists of anything that comes about as [the five skandhas of] name and form within [any possible samsaric] existence. The root of the afflictions {D78b} consists of any views and doubts that are preceded by clinging to"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"a real personality. Here, by virtue of its characteristic of coming forth, the suffering that consists of name and form is to be understood as being rep­resented by a sprout. {J9} Since the power of both the wisdom and the compassion of the Tathagata cuts through this [suffering], it should be known to be illustrated by the example of a sword. The afflictions to be re­linquished through seeing, which consist of said views and doubts and are difficult to understand through mundane wisdom, are difficult to penetrate. Therefore, they resemble a wall concealed by a thick forest. Due to being what breaks through these [afflictions], the power of both the wisdom and the compassion of the Tathagata should be understood to be illustrated by the example of a vajra.1160The instruction on the detailed analysis of these six qualities of the Tathagata as described should be known in this order according to the SarvabuddhavisaydvatarajMnalokalarnkdrasutra. There it is said:Mahjusri, [through this specification,] “what is without arising and without ceasing” {P79b} [should be understood to be a designation of] the Tathagata Arhat, the completely perfect Buddha.1161Through this, it is explained first that the Tathagata has the characteristic of being unconditioned. Right after this, the Tathagata’s being without aris­ing and without ceasing [is illustrated] by nine examples, starting with the example of a reflection of Sakra1162 on a ground of stainless beryl.1163 With regard to the meaning [of this], [the sutra] says:Mahjusri, likewise, the Tathagata Arhat, the completely perfect Bud­dha, does not move, does not reflect, is not discursive, does not think, and does not conceptualize. He is without thought, without concep­tion, without reflection, without mental engagement, peaceful, with­out arising, and without ceasing. He cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be smelled, cannot be tasted, and cannot be touched. {D79a}He is without characteristics, without cognizing, and without being cognizable.1164Thus and further goes the [sutras] discussion of different aspects of peacefulness.1165 Through this, it is explained that the Tathagata is effortless because in his own actions all discursiveness and conceptions are at peace. Then, the discussion of the [nine] examples in the following passage [of the sutra] explains the completely perfect awakening of the Tathagata withoutA Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 339"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"340 Translationsany other conditions with regard to the gateways to the completely per­fect awakening to the suchness of all phenomena. At the end, after having taught the sixteen aspects of the awakening of the Tathagata, [the sütra] says the following:Here, Mañjusrl, once the Tathagata has completely and perfectly awak­ened to all phenomena’s having such a nature and {P80a} has seen the dharmadhátu of sentient beings to be impure, not stainless, and blem­ished,1166 {J10} his great compassion, which is called “playful mastery,” unfolds for [all] sentient beings.1167This states that the Tathagata is endowed with unsurpassable wisdom and compassion. [In this passage,] “all phenomena’s having such a nature” [refers to phenomena] as they have been taught above as having the na­ture of the lack of entity.1168 “Completely and perfectly awakened” [means] “realized by nonconceptual buddha wisdom that accords with reality.” “Of sentient beings” [means] “of those who are categorized as the groups [whose disposition] is certain [in terms of what is correct], [whose dispo­sition] is uncertain, and [whose disposition] is certain in terms of what is mistaken.”1169 “The dharmadhátu” [refers to their] tathagata heart, which in essence is not different from the [Buddha’s] own true nature.1170 “Has seen” [means] “having seen all the aspects [of this tathagata heart in dif­ferent beings] with the Buddha s unobscured eyes.” “Impure” [refers to the impurity] of ordinary naive beings due to their afflictive obscurations. “Not stainless” [refers to the impurity] of šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas due to their cognitive obscurations. {D79b} “Blemished” [refers to the impurity] of bodhisattvas due to their remainders of either one of both of those [ob­scurations]. [The Buddhas compassion is called] “playful mastery” because of having entered into various gateways of perfect means of guidance. That this “compassion unfolds for [all] sentient beings” is because [the Buddha], as being the one who possesses the awakening of having completely and perfectly awakened for the sake of all sentient beings due to [their] being equal [for him to himself], has the intention to [make them] attain the realization of [the Buddhas] own true nature [that abides in them too]. Thereafter, due to the unfolding of unsurpassable wisdom and compas­sion, [the Buddha] engages in bringing about his turning of the wheel of the unequaled dharma in an uninterrupted manner. {P80b} This is to be understood as the power of both [wisdom and compassion] with regard to promoting the welfare of others."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Here, from among these six qualities of the Tathagata, in due order, to be endowed with the first three [qualities] (such as being unconditioned) represents the fulfillment of one’s own welfare, while [being endowed] with the latter three (such as wisdom) represents the fulfillment of the welfare of others. Or, [one can say that] it is [the quality of] wisdom that eluci­dates the fulfillment of ones own welfare, which is due to its having the property of being the basis of the completely perfect self-awakening that is the supreme and eternal abode of peace. Compassion and power [indicate] the fulfillment of the welfare of others due to their having the property of being the basis of [the activity of] turning the wheel of the great unsurpass­able dharma.Then, since the jewel of the dharma arises from the jewel of the Bud­dha, after the [presentation of the Buddha], there follows a verse on the [dharma]:Inscrutable as neither nonexistent nor existent nor [both] existent and nonexistent nor other than existent and nonexistent,Free from etymological interpretation, to be personally experienced, and peaceful—{J11}I pay homage to this sun of the dharma, which shines the light of stainless wisdomAnd defeats passion, aggression, and [mental] darkness with regard to all focal objects.11711.9W hat is taught by this?By virtue of its being inconceivable, free from the dual, nonconceptual,Pure, manifesting, and a remedial factor,1172It is what is and what makes free from attachment, respectively—The dharma that is characterized by the two realities. 1.10This [verse] describes the jewel of the dharma in brief as consisting of eight qualities. {D80a} W hat are these eight qualities?

Therefore, it should be understood that freedom from attachment consists of these [three qualities]. The remaining three qualities (being pure, manifesting, and remedial) explain the reality of the path. Therefore, it should be understood that the cause of being free from attachment consists of those [three qualities]. W hat is free from attachment is the reality of cessation.

Taking these two together, it is explained that this is “the dharma free from attachment that is characterized by the two realities of purification.”1173Because of being inscrutable, because of being inexpressible,And because of being the wisdom of the noble ones, it is inconceivable.Because of being peaceful, it is free from the dual and without conceptions.[In its] three [qualities] such as being pure, it-is like the sun. 1.12In brief, the reality of cessation should be understood as being inconceivable for three reasons. For which three [reasons]? [It is inconceivable] because of not being the sphere of scrutiny through the four permutations of nonexistence, existence, [both] existence and nonexistence, or neither; because of being inexpressible through any terms, voices, articulations, avenues of speech, etymologies, designations, conventions, or expressions; and because of being what is to be personally experienced by the noble ones. {J12} {D80b}How should it be understood here that the reality of cessation is free from the dual and without conceptions? {P81b} It is as the Bhagavan said [in the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesaparivarta]:Sariputra, the dharmakaya is peace,1174 having the nature of being free from the dual and having the nature of being without conceptions.1175"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"“The dual” here refers to [the dual obscurations of] karma and the afflic­tions. “Conception” refers to improper mental engagement,1176 the cause of the arising of karma and the afflictions. By virtue of realizing the natural cessation of this [improper mental engagement], there is no manifestation of the duo [of karma and the afflictions] or conception. Consequently, there is absolutely no arising of suffering. This is called “the reality of the cessation of suffering.” However, it is not that the reality of the cessation of suffering is explained by virtue of the destruction of any phenomenon. As [the Sarvabuddhavisayavatarajnanalokalamkarasutra] says at length:ManjusrI, in what lacks arising and lacks ceasing, mind, mentation, and consciousness1177 do not operate. Wherever there is no operation of mind, mentation, and consciousness, there is no improper mental en­gagement through which any [false] imagination could be taking place. Those who engage in proper mental engagement do not cause igno­rance to arise. In those in whom ignorance does not arise, the twelve links of [samsaric] existence do not arise. This is nonarising.1178As [the Srimaladevisimhanadasutra] says:However, Bhagavan, the cessation of suffering is not the destruction of phenomena. The name “cessation of suffering,” Bhagavan, indicates the dharmakaya of the Tathagata, which is beginningless, unproduced, unborn, unarisen, without extinction, free from extinction, permanent, eternal, peaceful, everlasting, naturally pure, free from the cocoon of all. afflictions, and endowed with inseparable {P82a} and inconceivable buddha attributes that far surpass the sand grains in the river Ganga [in number]. {D81a} Bhagavan, this very dharmakaya of the Tathagata that is not freed from the cocoon of the afflictions is called “tathagata heart.”1179Thus, the presentation of the reality of the cessation of suffering in its entire detail should be understood according to the sutras.The paths of seeing and familiarization that [consist of] nonconceptual wisdom are the causes for attaining this dharmakaya of the Tathagata, which bears the name “cessation of suffering.” [This wisdom] is to be understood as resembling the sun by way of being similar to it in three ways for the following reasons. By virtue of being similar to the orb [of the sun’s] being completely pure, it is free from all stains of the proximate afflictions.1180 ByA Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 343"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"344 Translationsvirtue of being similar to [the sun’s] being what makes forms manifest, it shines its light on all aspects of knowable objects. By virtue of being similar to [the sun’s] being the remedy for darkness, it serves as the remedy for all aspects of what obstructs seeing reality. {J13}As for “what obstructs,” due to the rising of their latencies, passion, ha­tred, and bewilderment, which are preceded by mentally engaging in focal objects that have the characteristic of being unreal entities, arise. For naive beings, it is by virtue of these latencies that unreal entities that lack the na­ture of those [entities that they seem to appear as], through the arising of passion, serve as the causes for [appearing] as something that looks pleas­ant; through the arising of hatred, as something that looks antagonistic; or, through the arising of bewilderment, as something that looks obscure. In those who take such causes of passion, hatred, and bewilderment, which do not accord with reality, as their focal objects, improper mental engagement {P82b} completely occupies the mind. In those whose minds are occupied with improper mental engagement, any affliction among passion, hatred, and bewilderment manifests. Due to this, they commit actions with body, speech, and mind that arise from passion and {D81b} also commit such actions that arise from hatred and from bewilderment. In turn, from these actions, there will be the succession of rebirths.In this way, improper mental engagement manifests in naive beings who possess those latencies, grasp at [certain] characteristics, and engage in them as their focal objects. From that, the afflictions arise. From the arising of the afflictions, actions arise. From the arising of actions, there is the arising of birth. So all aspects of the afflictiveness of afflictions, karma, and birth1181 of naive beings operate by virtue of not realizing and not seeing the single basic element in just the way it is in true reality.[However,] this [afflictiveness] should be seen in the same manner as a thorough investigator [sees] who does not see any characteristics or focal objects of this [afflictiveness]. W hen neither characteristics nor focal ob­jects are seen, true reality is seen. Thus, these phenomena are completely and perfectly realized by the Tathagata as being equal by virtue of their equality. In this way, [the Tathagata] does not see characteristics and focal objects, which are nonexistent, and sees ultimate reality, which is existent, in just the way it is in true reality. By virtue of [this seeing and nonseeing, the Tathagata] completely and perfectly realizes the equality of all phenom­ena through the wisdom of equality, in which neither of these two [nonex­istent characteristics and the existent ultimate reality] is to be removed or added. This [realization] should be understood as the remedy for all aspects"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 345of what obstructs the seeing of true reality. Through the arising of this [remedy], [the Tathagata] knows1182 that [his mind] is absolutely disasso­ciated and disconnected from the counterpart [of this remedy, that is, ev­erything that obstructs seeing true reality]. {P83a} The paths of seeing and familiarization that consist of nonconceptual wisdom and are the causes for attaining the dharmakaya are to be understood in detail according to the sutras by following the prajnaparamita [sutras].Now, since the jewel of the samgha of irreversible bodhisattvas1183 arises from the jewel of the mahayana dharma, after the [presentation of the dharma], there follows a verse on the [samgha]: {J14}They perfectly realize that the endpoint of the identitylessness of the entire world is peace Because they see that, by virtue of the natural luminosity of the minds in this [world], the afflictions are without nature. {D82a}I pay homage to those who see that perfect buddhahood is all- pervading, whose intelligence is unobscured,And whose wisdom vision has the purity and infinitude of beings as its objects. 1.13What is taught by this?By virtue of the purity of the inner Wisdom vision of suchness and variety,The assembly of the irreversible intelligent ones Is [endowed] with unsurpassable qualities. 1.14This [verse] explains in brief that the jewel of the assembly of irreversible bodhisattvas is endowed with unsurpassable qualities by virtue of the purity of the vision of supramundane wisdom in terms of two aspects— [the tathagata heart as] being suchness and [as] being variety.1184[The wisdom of] suchness1185 by virtue of Realizing the world’s true nature of peace Is due to the natural complete purity [of the mind]And due to seeing the primordial termination of the afflictions.1.15"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"346 TranslationsHere, [the wisdom of knowing the tathagata heart as] being suchness should be understood by virtue of realizing, just as it is, the endpoint of the identitylessness of the whole world that is referred to as “persons and phenomena.” This is the realization in terms of the principle that persons and phenomena, by virtue of their nature of being absolutely and primordially at peace, are not annihilated. {P83b} In brief, [this realization] arises from two causes—through seeing that m ind is naturally luminous and through seeing that its proximate afflictions are primordially term inated and ceased.Now, {J15} these two [factors]—“m inds natural luminosity” and “its [concomitant] proximate afflictions”—in relation to the uncontaminated basic element are extremely difficult to understand. For both sound and unsound minds [always] occur alone, without [one of them ever] being associated with the other1186 one. Therefore, [the Srimaládevisütra] says:Bhagavan, the sound mind is momentary. It is not afflicted by the af­flictions. The unsound mind is [also] momentary. Even this [unsound] mind is not afflicted by the afflictions. Bhagavan, the afflictions do not touch the mind, {D82b} nor does the mind [touch] the afflictions.1187 So how, Bhagavan, does the mind, which has this nature of being untouch­able [by the afflictions], still become afflicted by darkness? Bhagavan, there is proximate affliction and there is the mind that is proximately afflicted. Still, Bhagavan, the meaning of naturally pure minds being afflicted is difficult to understand.1188Thus, the instruction on the meaning of [the above passage] “being suchness... difficult to understand” should be understood in detail accord­ing to the sütra.[The wisdom of] being variety is due toThe intelligence that encompasses the entire range of the knowable Seeing the existence of the true nature Of omniscience in all sentient beings. 1.16Now, [the wisdom of the tathagata heart as] being variety is to be understood due to the supramundane prajñá that encompasses the entire range of knowable entities seeing {P84a} the existence of the tathagata heart in all sentient beings, even in those who are born in the animal realm.1189 This seeing of bodhisattvas arises on the first bodhisattvabhümi"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Maháyana 347since they realize the dharmadhátu as being the actuality of omnipresence. {J16}Such a realization is the vision Of one’s own personal wisdom.It is pure in the stainless basic elementBecause it lacks attachm ent and lacks obstruction. 1.17Thus, in this way, by virtue of [the wisdoms of the tathagata heart as] being suchness and [as] being variety, the realization of the supramundane path is meant to be the vision of the [maháyana] noble ones’ own personal supramundane wisdom, which is not in common with others. In brief, compared to the visions of any other limited [kinds of] wisdom, it is described as being utterly pure1190 for two reasons. For which two [reasons is this]? [It is so] because [this wisdom] lacks attachment and because it lacks obstruction. Here, by virtue of [its knowing the tathagata heart as] being suchness, [this wisdom] has the naturally pure basic element of sentient beings as its object. {D83a} Therefore, it lacks attachment. By virtue of [its knowing the tathagata heart as] being variety, it has limitless knowable entities as its objects. Therefore, it lacks obstruction.1191By virtue of this purity of the vision of wisdom,The noble ones, who are irreversible1192 From unsurpassable buddha wisdom,1193 Are the refuge of all that lives. 1.18Thus, this purity of the vision of the wisdom of bodhisattvas who dwell on the level of irreversibility is to be understood as being unsurpassable because it serves as the basis [or precursor]1194 of the unsurpassable purity of the vision of tathagata wisdom. {P84b} Or, [it is unsurpassable compared] to the other qualities of bodhisattvas, such as generosity and discipline. Since irreversible bodhisattvas are endowed with this [purity of vision], they represent the refuge of all sentient beings.1195There is no mention of the jewel of the srávaka samgha after the jewel of the assembly of bodhisattvas because the [former] is not worthy of being venerated.1196 Indeed, no learned ones who know the distinction between the qualities of bodhisattvas and šrávakas would ever cast away the new moon of bodhisattvas with its disk of wisdom and compassion perfecting the vast accumulations of merit and wisdom for great awakening, which"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"348 Translationsis engaged in illuminating the mind streams that consist of the multitudes of1197 the basic elements of innumerable sentient beings and has entered the path that accords with approaching the full moon of the unsurpassable Tathagata, {J17} and then pay homage to the sravakas [instead], who have reached the consummation of their limited wisdom, but [only] engage in illuminating their own mind streams, just as the forms of stars [illuminate only themselves]. Even those bodhisattvas who have given rise to [bodhi] citta for the first time, by virtue of its quality of being based on the purity of their intention to promote the benefit of others, outshine noble sravakas, who lack compassion and belong to the class of those who do not support others,1198 though1199 they have reached the perfect purity of immaculately observing [proper] discipline. {D83b} So how much more is this the case for the other qualities of bodhisattvas, such as the ten masteries? Indeed, it is to be said [here]:Those who nourish discipline performed for their own sake, {P85a} Devoid of compassion for sentient beings with bad discipline,And possess the purity of the wealth of discipline [only for] their own nourishment—Those noble ones are not called “those with pure discipline.”Those who give rise to supreme compassion for others And adopt discipline support the livelihood of others,Just like fire, wind, water, and earth.They [truly] possess discipline, [but] others are [only] a likeness of that.Now, for what purpose and based on what did the Bhagavan teach the three refuges?For the purpose of the teacher, the teaching, and the disciples,The three refuges are taughtW ith regard to those in the three yanasAnd those who have faith in the three activities. 1.19{J18} [The instruction that] “the Buddha is a refuge because of being the highest among humans”1200 is taught and discussed for the purpose of demonstrating the qualities of the teacher, with regard to the persons in the bodhisattvayana1201 who are suitable to [attain] the state of the Buddha,"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 349and those who have faith in the supreme activities related to the Buddha. [The instruction that] “the dharma is a refuge because of being the highest among what is free from attachment” is taught and discussed for the purpose of demonstrating the qualities of the teaching of the teacher, with regard to the persons in the pratyekabuddhayana who are suitable to realize the profound dharma of dependent origination by themselves, and those who have faith in the supreme activities related to the dharma. [The instruction that] “the samgha is a refuge because of being the highest among assemblies” is taught and discussed for the purpose of demonstrating the qualities of the disciples who have well entered the teaching of the teacher, with regard to the persons in the sravakayana who are suitable to realize the discourses that they heard from others, and {P85b} those who have faith in the supreme activities related to the samgha. {D84a}In brief, through this, the Bhagavan taught and discussed these three ref­uges for those three purposes and with regard to the [above] six [kinds of] persons by distinguishing them from the standpoint of seeming [reality] so that sentient beings enter this [dharma] system in successive order.1202Because of being abandoned, because of having a deceptive nature, Because of being nonexistent, and because of being fearful,The twofold dharm a and the noble samgha Are not the ultimate supreme refuge. 1.20The dharma is twofold: the dharma as teaching and the dharma as realization. Here, the dharma as teaching refers to reading [or reciting]1203 the teachings, such as the sutras, and it consists of the collections of the names, words, and letters [of the sutras and so on]. [This dharma] is said to be like a raft,1204 because it comes to its end through being clearly realized on the path.The dharma as realization is twofold through being divided into cause and result. That is, [it consists of] the reality of the path and the reality of cessation, {J19} which refers to that through which it is realized and that which [is realized]. Here, the path is included in what has the characteristic of being conditioned. W hat is included in what has the characteristic of be­ing conditioned has a deceptive and false nature; what has a deceptive and false nature is unreal; what is unreal is impermanent; and what is imperma­nent is not a [lasting] refuge. Also, according to the system of the sravakas, the cessation realized by that path consists of the mere nonexistence of"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"350 Translationsafflictions and suffering, just like the extinction of a lamp. But a nonexis­tence is not suitable to be either a refuge or a nonrefuge. {P86a}“The samgha” is a term for the assemblies of those in the three yanas. They are always fearful because they take refuge in the Tathagata, search for final deliverance, [still] have to learn [more] and have [many more] things to do, and are [only] approaching unsurpassable completely perfect awakening. How are they fearful? Even the arhats, who have terminated further existences [in samsara], {D84b} did not destroy their latent tenden­cies and therefore are always and continuously immersed in a strong sense of fear of all formations [of samsara], as if [being afraid] of an executioner with raised sword. Therefore, even they have not attained the ultimate and blissful final deliverance. [In general, what constitutes a genuine] refuge does not seek refuge [elsewhere]. Just as sentient beings without a refuge are frightened by this or that fear and consequently seek deliverance from those [fears], likewise, arhats have their [kind of] fear and, being frightened by that fear, consequendy take refuge in the Tathagata. Thus, since they have fear, they take refuge and undoubtedly seek for deliverance from that fear. Since they seek for deliverance from fear, they [still] have [more] to learn and have [many more] things to do with regard to destroying the ba­sis of that fear. Since they [still] have [more] to learn, {J20} they are [only] approaching the attainment of the fearless supreme1205 state, that is, un­surpassable completely perfect awakening.

That is, [they are jewels] by virtue of resembling [jewels] in that their appearance is difficult to encounter because those who have not acquired roots of virtue do not get a chance to meet them even during many eons. [They are also jewels] by virtue of resembling [jewels] in that they are stainless because they are free from all kinds of stains. [They are furthermore jewels] by virtue of resembling [jewels] in their power {P87a} because they are endowed with qualities of inconceivable power, such as the six supernatural knowledges. [They are likewise jewels] by virtue of resembling [jewels] in that they are the ornaments of the world because they are the causes of the splendid1212 intentions of the entire world. [They are also jewels] by virtue of resembling [jewels] in that they are supreme [compared to] artificial jewels because they are supramundane. [Finally, they are jewels] by virtue of resembling [jewels] in that they are changeless through praise, blame, and so on, because their nature is unconditioned. {J21}Following the discussion of the three jewels, [there follows] one verse about the source of mundane and supramundane purity, from whose exis­tence the three jewels arise.Suchness with stains, the one without stains,Stainless buddha qualities, and the activity of the victors Are the objects of those who see the ultimate,From which the three splendid1213 jewels arise.12141.23What is elucidated by this?"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"352 TranslationsThe disposition of the three jewelsIs the object of those who see everything. {D85b}It is fourfold and is inconceivable For four reasons in due order 1.24Here,1215 suchness with stains is the basic element that is not liberated from the cocoon of the afflictions, which is called “the tathagata heart.” Stainless suchness is this very same [basic element] as it is characterized by the fundamental change1216 on the buddhabhumi, which is called “the dharmakaya of a tathagata.” The stainless buddha qualities are the supramundane buddha attributes (such as the ten powers) within that very dharmakaya of a tathagata that is characterized by the fundamental change. The activity of the victors {P87b} consists of the distinct unsurpassable activities of these very buddha attributes (such as the ten powers), continuing to give prophesying speeches about bodhisattvas in an endless, uninterrupted, and unceasing manner. According to their order, these four points are inconceivable for four reasons. Therefore, they are said to be “the object of omniscience.” For which four [reasons are they inconceivable]?Since it is pure and yet associated with afflictions,Since it is not afflicted and yet becomes pure,Since its qualities are inseparable,And since [its activity] is effortless and nonconceptual. 1.25Here, suchness with stains is pine and afflicted at one and the same time. This point is inconceivable because it is an object that is not even within the sphere of the pratyekabuddhas who have faith in the principle of the profound dharma. Therefore, {J22} [the Srimdladevisutra] says:Devi, these two dharmas are difficult to understand. It is difficult to understand that mind is pure by nature. It is difficult to understand that this very mind is proximately afflicted. Devi, those who are able to hear these two dharmas are only you or the bodhisattvas who are endowed with the great attributes. Devi, the remaining ones—all ¿ravakas and {D86a} pratyekabuddhas—can understand these two dharmas only through confidence in the Tathagata.1217"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Now, the point that suchness without stains is originally not afflicted by stains [but] becomes pure later is [also] inconceivable. Therefore, [the Dhdranisvararajasutra] says:The mind is luminous by nature. This is realized just as it is. Therefore, {P88a} it is said, “[The Tathagata] fully awakened to completely perfect awakening through the prajna that is characterized by having a single instant.”1218Next, even on the level of ordinary beings who are absolutely afflicted, there exist the stainless buddha qualities that are without difference earlier and later by virtue of their nature of being inseparable [from the basic element]. This point is [likewise] inconceivable. Therefore, [the Buddha- vatamsakasutra] says:Within the hosts of sentient beings, there is no sentient being whatso­ever that is not pervaded by tathagata wisdom in its entirety. However, through their discriminating clinging,1219 they do not realize tathagata wisdom. By virtue of becoming free from discriminating clinging, om­niscient wisdom, which is self-arisen wisdom, becomes manifest in an unimpeded manner.1220O son of the victor, it is as follows. Suppose there were a big can­vas1221 the size of the worldly realm that is the biggest chiliocosm in a trichiliocosm. On this big canvas the entire worldly realm that is the biggest chiliocosm in a trichiliocosm would be painted in its complete form.

[Thus,] this big canvas would have the size of the vast expanse of the worldly realm that is the biggest chiliocosm in a trichiliocosm. Then, this big canvas would be inserted into a single particle [the size] of the minutest particle. Like­wise, just as this big canvas would be inserted into a single particle [the size] of the minutest particle, big canvases of that same size would be inserted inside all particles [the size] of the minutest particle without exception.1223Then, there would appear some learned person, clever, intelligent, wise, and endowed with the profound investigative skill pertinent to [these canvases] here. His divine eye would be perfectly pure and lucid. With that divine eye, he would look [and think], “This big canvas of such a nature stays here in such a limited single particle [the size] of the minutest particle. It does not sustain any sentient being.” So he would think, “Breaking apart this particle [the size] of the minutest particle with the strength and power of great vigor, I shall make this big canvas into what sustains the whole world.” Giving rise to the strength and power of great vigor, he would break apart that particle [the size] of the minutest particle with a tiny vajra and, according to his intention, make that big canvas into what sustains the whole world. Just as for one, he would do the same for all minutest particles without exception.Likewise, O son of the victor, tathagata wisdom, {P89a} the immea­surable wisdom {D87a} that is the wisdom that sustains all sentient be­ings, pervades the mind streams of all sentient beings in its entirety. All these mind streams of sentient beings are also as immeasurable1224 as tathagata wisdom. Nevertheless, naive beings, who are bound by dis­criminating clinging, {J24} do not know, cognize, realize, and perceive this tathagata wisdom. Therefore, the Tathagata, after having seen the states of all sentient beings [whose nature is the] dharmadhatu1225 with unobstructed tathagata wisdom, resolves to be a teacher. [He thinks,] “What a pity! These sentient beings do not realize tathagata wisdom, just as it is, [though] they are pervaded by this tathagata wisdom. Through teaching them the noble path, I shall remove all the fetters of these sentient beings that they create through discrimination so that they, by themselves, undo the big knot of discrimination through adopting the power of that noble path1226 and then recognize1227 that tathagata wisdom [in themselves] and attain equality with the Tathagata.”"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"[Accordingly,] through the teaching of the path of the Tathagata, they remove all fetters created by discrimination.

Therefore, [the DhàranUvararà- jasütra] says:Though tathàgata activity1230 is immeasurable, in order to introduce sentient beings [to it] in just a brief form, it is taught as if having some measure. {D87b} However, O son of noble family, the true tathàgata activity of the Tathàgata is immeasurable, inconceivable, unknowable by the entire world, indescribable by words, difficult to accomplish by others, abiding {J25} in all buddha realms, entailing equality with all buddhas, beyond all activities with effort, nonconceptual due to being equal to space, and without any difference due to being the activity of the dharmadhàtu.1231After [the sütra s] having given the example of the pure beryl, [tathàgata activity] is taught in detail as follows:Son of noble family, by this specification, inconceivable tathàgata ac­tivity is to be understood as entailing equality, being without blame in all respects, being related to the three times,1232 and not interrupting the lineage of the three jewels. Abiding in this inconceivable tathàgata ac­tivity, the Tathàgata never abandons the space [-like] nature of his body and yet displays it in all buddha realms. He does not abandon the inex­pressible nature of his speech and yet teaches the dharma for sentient beings by way of concordant verbal representations. He is free from all focal objects of the mind and yet knows the activities and intentions of the minds of all sentient beings.1233 {P90a}As for what is to be awakened, awakening,Its branches, and what causes awakening, in due order,A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahâyàna 355"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"356 TranslationsOne point is the cause and three Are the conditions for its purity. 1.26Due to these four topical points comprising everything to be known, the first one is to be regarded as the point of what is to be awakened. Awakening refers to the awakening of that [which is to be awakened]—the second point of awakening. The buddha qualities serve as the branches of awakening—the third point of the branches of awakening. {D88a} It is these very branches of awakening that cause the awakening of others—the fourth point of what causes awakening.1234 Thus, the presentation of the disposition of the three jewels should be understood based on these four points in terms of being the state of a cause and [its three] conditions.Here, the first one among these four points, due to its being the seed of the supramundane attributes, should be understood as the cause for the arising of the three jewels, which is by virtue of its becoming pure based on one’s personal mental engagement in a proper manner. Thus, “one point is the cause.” How is it that the [other] three [points] are conditions? A tathagata, upon having fully awakened to unsurpassable completely perfect awakening, performs the thirty-two kinds of tathagata activities through the buddha qualities (such as the ten powers). Thus, by virtue of the voice of someone else [this tathagata], the [obscured tathagata heart in certain beings] becomes pure.

By virtue of being the remedies for that [latter mistakenness, there is] the presentation of the four kinds of pàramitàs that are the qualities of the dharmakàya of the Tathagata, that is, the pâramità of permanence, the pàramità of bliss, {P93b} the pàramitâ of a self, and the pâramità of purity. This passage {D91a} is to be understood in detail according to the [$rïmâlâdevï]sütra:Bhagavan, sentient beings are mistaken about the five appropriating skandhas that they have taken on. They entertain the notion that what is impermanent is permanent, the notion that what is suffering is bliss, the notion that what lacks a self has a self, and the notion that what is impure is pure. Bhagavan, even all éràvakas and pratyekabuddhas are mistaken about the dharmakàya of the Tathàgata, which has not been seen by the wisdom of emptiness before and is the object of omni­scient wisdom [alone].1261 {J31} Bhagavan, those sentient beings who1262 entertain the notion of permanence, the notion of bliss, the notion of a self, and the notion of purity are the legitimate heart sons of the Bhagavàn. Bhagavan, these sentient beings are unmistaken. Bhagavan, these sentient beings have the correct view. For what reason is that so? Bhagavan, this dharmakàya of the Tathàgata is indeed the pàramità of permanence, the pâramità of bliss, the pàramità of a self, and the pâramità of purity. Those sentient beings who see this dharmakàya of the Tathàgata in that way see correctly. Those who see correctly are the legitimate heart sons of the Bhagavàn.1263The reverse order of these four pàramitàs that are the qualities of the dharmakàya of the Tathàgata should be understood by way of the order of the [above-mentioned four] causes [of purity]. Here, (1) by way of being the opposite of those with great desire who are hostile toward the mahàyàna dharma {P94a} taking delight in impure samsàra, the attainment of the pàramità of purity should be regarded as the fruition of bodhisat- tvas’ having cultivated faith in the mahàyàna dharma."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 363(2) By way of being the opposite of the tlrthikas, who are other [than us] and regard the five appropriating skandhas as a self, taking delight in clinging to a nonexistent self, {D91b} the attainment of the paramita of the supreme self should be regarded as the fruition of [bodhisattvas’] hav­ing cultivated prajnaparamita. Thus, all tlrthikas, who are other [than us], claim that [certain] entities such as form, which do not have the nature of that [which they appear as], are the self. [However,] since these entities as they are apprehended by those [tlrthikas] are deceiving1264 in terms of the characteristic of being a self, they never are a self. On the other hand, the Tathagata has attained the paramita of the supreme lack of self of all phe­nomena through the wisdom of [realizing] true reality just as it is. Since this lack of self, just as it is seen by the [Tathagata], is undeceiving in terms of its characteristic of not being a self, it is taken to be a self at all times. [Thus, here,] it is the very lack of self that is referred to as “self,”1265 just as [the prajnaparamita sutras] speak of “abiding in a nonabiding m anner.”(3) Byway of being the opposite of those who belong to the ¿ravakayana, who are afraid of the suffering of samsara, {J32} taking delight in the mere pacification of samsaric suffering, the attainment of the paramita of all m undane and supramundane bliss should be regarded as the fruition of [bodhisattvas] having cultivated samadhis such as the Sky Treasure.(4) By way of being the opposite of those who belong to the pratyeka- buddhayana, who are indifferent about the welfare of sentient beings, tak­ing delight in dwelling in solitude, {P94b} the attainment of the paramita of permanence should be regarded as the fruition of [bodhisattvas’] having cultivated great compassion because [bodhisattvas] are always and without interruption consumed by their desire1266 for the welfare of sentient beings for as long as samsara exists.Thus, in due order, the fourfold cultivation of faith, prajna, samadhi, and compassion by bodhisattvas accomplishes the fruition that is called “the four kinds of paramitas that are the qualities of purity, self, bliss, and permanence in the dharmakaya of the Tathagata.” By virtue of these [paramitas], the Tathagata said, “having reached the full extent of the dharmadhatu, extending to the limits of the element of space, {D92a} and lasting until the end of time.”1267 Through having cultivated faith in the su­preme dharma of the mahayana, the Tathagata attained the supreme state of the utterly pure dharmadhatu. Therefore, he accomplished the supreme dharmadhatu. Through having cultivated prajnaparamita, [the Tathagata] perfectly realized the space-like lack of self of the world [that consists] of sentient beings and their container. Through having cultivated samadhis"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"364 Translationssuch as the Sky Treasure, he displays his mastery over being the supreme lord of dharma everywhere. For the two reasons [presented in the last two sentences, the Tathagata] extends to the limits of the element of space. Through having cultivated great compassion, [the Tathagata] is endowed with compassion for all sentient beings beyond the limits of time. It is based on this that [the Tathagata] lasts until the end of time.Now, even though they abide in the uncontaminated basic element, for arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained the [ten] masteries,1268 there are four obstructions to acquiring the four paramitas that are the qualities of the dharmakaya of the Tathagata. {P95a} These are [the obstructions] that have (1) the characteristic of a condition, (2) the characteristic of a cause, (3) the characteristic of arising, and (4) the characteristic of perishing.Here, (1) [the obstruction] that has the characteristic of a condition [refers to] the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, similar to ig­norance [being the condition] of [karmic] formations.1269 (2) [The obstruc­tion] that has the characteristic of a cause [refers to] the uncontam inated karma that is conditioned by the ground of the latent tendencies of igno­rance and is similar to the [karmic] formations [of ordinary beings]. (3) [The obstruction] that has the characteristic of arising [refers to] the occur­rence of three kinds of bodies1270 that are of mental nature and are caused by the uncontaminated karma that is conditioned by the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, {J33} which is similar to the occurrence of the three [kinds of samsaric] existences caused by the contaminated karma that is conditioned by the four appropriating factors.1271 (4) [The obstruc­tion] that has the characteristic of perishing [refers to] the death that is an inconceivable transformation1272 and is conditioned by the occurrence of the [above-mentioned] three kinds of bodies that are of mental nature, similar to aging and death being conditioned by birth.Here, arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained the masteries {D92b} have not relinquished the ground of the latent tenden­cies of ignorance that represents the foundation of all proximate afflictions. Therefore, they have not attained the excellent final paramita of the pu­rity of all latent tendencies1273 of the foul-smelling afflictive stains.1274 On account of this ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, they [still] possess subtle [kinds of] engaging in [certain] reference points of charac­teristics. Therefore, they have not attained the paramita of self that is utterly without any [mental] formations.

Therefore, they have not attained the pâramità of the utter bliss of such [a skandha’s] having ceased. For as long as {P95b} they do not perceive the tathagata element, which becomes apparent1275 due to the cessation of all afflictiveness in terms of affliction, karma, and birth without exception, they are not free from the death that is an inconceivable transformation. Therefore, they have not attained the pàramità of permanence that is the state of being absolutely unchanging.Here, the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance is similar to the afflictiveness of affliction. The formations of uncontaminated karma are similar to the afflictiveness of karma. The occurrence of the three kinds of bodies that are of a mental nature and the death that is an inconceivable transformation are similar to the afflictiveness of birth. This passage is to be understood in detail according to the [Srïmâlâdevï]sütra:O Bhagavan, the three [kinds of samsàric] existences arise [through] be­ing caused by the contaminated karma that is conditioned by the [four] appropriating factors. Likewise, Bhagavan, {J34} the three bodies of a mental nature of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained the masteries arise [through] being caused by the uncontami­nated karma that is conditioned by the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance. Bhagavan, the ground of the latent tendencies of igno­rance is the condition1276 for the arising of these three bodies of a mental nature on the three levels [of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisat­tvas] and for the origination of uncontaminated karma.1277 {D93a}Therefore, in these three bodies of a mental nature of arhats, pratyeka­buddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained the masteries, there are no pàramitàs that are the qualities of purity, self, bliss, and permanence. Hence, [the Érïmâlâdevîsütra] says:This dharmakàya of the Tathàgata is indeed the pàramità of perma­nence, the pàramità of bliss, the pàramità of a self, and the pàramità of purity.1278Because the [dharmakàya] is naturally pure {P96a}A nd free from latent tendencies, it is pure.A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 365"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"366 TranslationsIt is the supreme self because the reference points O f self and no-self are at peace.1279 1.37It is bliss because the skandha of a m ental nature And its causes have come to an end.It is perm anent because the equality O f samsara and nirvana is realized. 1.38In brief, the paramita of purity in terms of the dharmakaya of the Tathagata should be understood through two reasons—by virtue of the natural purity that is its general characteristic and by virtue of the purity of being stainless that is its particular characteristic. [Its] paramita of self should [also] be understood through two reasons—by virtue of being free from the reference points of a self due to having abandoned the extreme of the tlrthikas and by virtue of being free from the reference points of no­self due to having abandoned the extreme of the ¿ravakas. [Its] paramita of bliss should [likewise] be understood through two reasons—by virtue of having overcome [all] linking [to samsara] through latent tendencies due to having relinquished all aspects of the origin of suffering and by virtue of perceiving the cessation of the skandha1280 of a m ental nature due to perceiving all aspects of the cessation of suffering. [Its] paramita of perm anence should [also] be understood through two reasons—by virtue of not falling into the extreme of extinction due to not denying impermanent samsara and by virtue of not falling into the extreme of eternity due to not superimposing1281 permanent nirvana.

Bhagavan, {D93b} if someone were to see nirvana as being permanent, this would be their view of eternity. It would not be their correct view.1282By virtue of this introduction to the principle of the dharmadhatu, it is said that, ultimately, samsara itself is nirvana, {P96b} because [tathagatas] realize the nonabiding nirvana in which neither [samsara nor nirvana] are conceived.1283Moreover, they are free from being close to, or distant from, all sentient beings without difference for two reasons. Therefore, what is explained [here] is the mere attainment of the abode of nonabiding. For which two"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"[reasons is that so]?

This is the means for attaining the completely perfect awakening that has the nature of being nonabiding. By virtue of having relinquished all latencies of craving without exception due to their prajňá, bodhisattvas are intent on passing into nirvána for their own benefit and do not rem ain1284 in samsára like those who do not have the disposition for passing into parinirvána. By virtue of not abandoning suffering sentient beings due to their great compassion, they make efforts in entering samsára for the benefits of others and do not remain in nirvána like those who have the disposition of solely seeking [the personal] peace [of nirvána].1285 In this way, these two dharmas [prajňá and compassion] are taught1286 to be the fundamental ground for [attaining] unsurpassable awakening:W ith prajňá, they cut through all self-cherishing without exception.Because they cherish sentient beings, those full of compassion do not approach peace.Relying in this way on intelligence and compassion, the two means for awakening,The noble ones approach neither sam sára1287 nor nirvána. 1.39Now, what is taught by the latter half of verse [1.35] about (4) the topic of function, which was referred to above [in that verse]?If the buddha element did not exist,There would be no weariness of suffering,N or would there be the wish, striving, {D94a}And aspiration for nirvána. 1.40{J36} As [the Šrímáládevisutra] says: {P97a}Bhagavan, if the tathágata heart did not exist, there would be no wea­riness of suffering nor the wish, striving, and aspiration for nirvána.1288Here, in brief, even in those sentient beings who have [the dispositions that are] certain in terms of what is mistaken, the buddha element, which is the disposition for purity, readily procures this twofold function.

[Thus,] this [seeing] is not something without a cause or something without a condition. For what reason [is this so]?1295 If such [seeing] could happen without the disposition, without a cause, without a condition, and without entailing the term ination of wrongdoing,1296 it would also happen in those with great desire who are w ithout the disposition for nirvana. [However, this seeing] does not occur as long as [sentient beings] have not given rise to faith in the dharm a of one of the three [yânas]—the disposition for being pure of adventitious stains1297—by way of bringing together the four wheels of relying on wise persons1298 and so on.1299 {P97b} Therefore, [the Jnànàlokàlamkârasütra] says:Therefore, after that, {D94b} the rays of wisdom1300 of the orb of the sun of the Tathagata fall upon the bodies of even those sentient beings [whose disposition] is certain in terms of what is mistaken, [thus bene­fiting them and,]1301 due to producing the causes of future [happiness], {J37} making them thrive through virtuous dharmas.1302Also, the statement [in the Mahâparinirvànasütra and others] that “those with great desire have the nature of absolutely not [attaining] pa- rinirvâna” [means] that their hostility toward the mahayana dharm a is the cause for their having great desire.

[Here, the fact of] these three dharmas’1307 being associated with the three kinds of causes [mentioned above, that is], their being connected with them, is called “endowment.” Now, what is taught by the latter half of verse [1.42]?In the stainless foundation, the supernatural knowledges,W isdom, and stainlessness1308 are inseparable from suchness.

They consist of [being endowed with] (1) the supernatural knowledges, (2) the wisdom of the termination of contaminations, and (3) the term ination of contaminations.

It is pure by virtue of the cognitive obscurations’ having been relinquished.1313 It is luminous by virtue of not having the nature of these two1314 adventitious [stains]. Thus, in brief, these seven dharmas in the mind streams of nonlearners (which consist of the [five] uncontaminated1315 supernatural knowledges, wisdom, and relinquishment) [that exist] in the uncontaminated basic element are inseparable from each other, not distinct [from each other], and associated with the dharm adhatu in terms of [both] being equal.1316 This is what is called “endowment” [here]."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"This example of a lamp with regard to the topic of endowment is to be understood in detail according to the [Anünatvápürnatvanirdesa]sütra:Šáriputra, it is as follows.

It should be understood that, in brief, the three [types of] persons engage it in three different ways—ordinary beings who do not see true reality,1320 noble ones who see true reality, and tathágatas who have reached the ultimate purity of seeing true reality.1321 {D96a} That is, [these persons] are mistaken, unmistaken, {J40} and perfectly unm istaken and free from reference points, respectively. Here, “mistaken” refers to [the way of engaging] of naive beings because they are mistaken in terms of discrimination, mind, and view. “Unmistaken” refers to [the way of engaging] of the noble ones because they, being opposite [to naive beings], have relinquished such [mistakenness]. “Perfectly unmistaken andA Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Maháyána 371"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"372 Translationsfree from reference points” refers to [the way of engaging] of completely perfect buddhas because they have overcome [all] afflictive and cognitive obscurations, including their latent tendencies.Following this, the four topics other than this one should be understood as instructions on specific aspects of the topic of manifestation.1322Now, [there follows] a verse about (7) the topic of the distinction [of the tathagata heart] through the phases of those three [kinds of] persons. {P99b}Its being impure, its being both im pure and pure,A nd its being completely pure, in due order,Are expressed as “the basic elem ent1323 of sentient beings,” “Bodhisattva,” and “tathagata.” 1.47W hat is taught by this?The basic element that consists o f 324 these Six topics, such as [its] nature,Is taught1325 through three names In its three phases. 1.48Any instructions on the uncontaminated basic elem ent that the Bhagavan taught in detail in various dharma specifications are all contained, in brief, in these six topics of its nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment, and manifestation.

For what reason is that? Bhagavan, the tathágata heart is beyond being an object that has the characteristic of being conditioned. [Rather,] it is permanent, everlasting, peaceful, and eternal.1350Now, [there follows the one] verse about the topic of changelessness in the phase of [the tathágata elements] being both impure and pure.Having realized the nature of this [basic element] just as it is,Free from birth, death, sickness, and aging,The intelligent, due to giving rise to compassion for beings,Assume the predicaments of birth and so on despite lacking their causes.13511.66W hat is taught by this?"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 379The root of the sufferings of death, sickness,And aging is removed by the noble ones.[Such suffering] is born from the power of karm a and afflictions,[But] they lack it because they lack these.1352 1.67{P103a} The substantial cause of the fires of the sufferings of death, sickness, and aging during the phase of [the tathagata elements] being impure is the fuel-like being born that is preceded by improper mental engagement, karma, and afflictions. In bodhisattvas during the phase of [the tathagata element’s] being both impure and pure, who have obtained a body of a mental nature, there is no appearance whatsoever [of such a cause], {D99b} Because of that, it is understood that the others [the fires of death and so on that are the results of being born] do not blaze at all [either]. {J47}Due to their character of compassion,They display birth, death, aging, and sickness,[But] they are beyond birth and so onBecause they see [the basic element] as it really is. 1.68Bodhisattvas who are united with roots of virtue,1353 by relying on their mastery over [taking] birth as they wish, connect with [samsara] in its three realms due to their compassion. They display birth, and they also display aging, sickness, and death. However, these phenomena of birth and so on do not exist in them because they see the lack of birth and the lack of arising of the basic element as it really is.This phase of bodhisattvas is to be understood in detail according to the [Sdgaramatipariprccha] sutra, which says:“W hat are the afflictions that continue samsara and are associated with roots of virtue? They are as follows. [Bodhisattvas] are never content with [their efforts in] seeking out the accumulation of merit, take birth in [samsaric] existence as they wish, earnesdy desire to meet buddhas, are never weary of maturing sentient beings,1354 make efforts in grasp­ing the genuine dharma, exert themselves in whatever is to be done for sentient beings, are never separated from the motivation of desiring the dharma, and do not abandon their union with the paramitas. Saga- ramati, these are the afflictions that are associated with roots of virtue, through which bodhisattvas connect [with samsara], but they are never affected by the flaws of these afflictions.”"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"38o TranslationsThen [Sagaramati] said, {P103b} “Bhagavan, if these are roots of virtue, for what reason are they called afflictions’?”[The Bhagavan] answered, “Sagaramati, it is as follows. It is through afflictions of such a nature that bodhisattvas connect with [samsara] in its three realms. [Samsara] in its three realms arises from afflictions. Now, {DIOOa} it is through their skill in means and through bringing about the power of their roots of virtue1355 that bodhisattvas connect with [samsara] in its three realms as they wish. Therefore, [these af­flictions] are called afflictions that are associated with roots of virtue.’. [They are called afflictions’] because they connect [bodhisattvas] with [samsara] in its three realms for as long as [these realms] exist, but not because they afflict their minds.O Sagaramati, suppose there were a distinguished1356 householder’s only son, who is beloved, handsome, attractive, and lovely to behold. This boy, being a child, would fall into a pit of excrement while danc­ing. Then the family and the relatives1357 of this boy would see that the boy has fallen into that pit of excrement. Upon seeing this, they would sigh deeply, wail, and lament. However, they would not [be able to] enter that pit of excrement {J48} and pull out the boy. Then the father of this boy would come to this place and see his only son fallen into the pit of excrement. Upon seeing that, out of [his fatherly] love, he would wish to seize1358 his only son, thus hurrying to enter the pit of excre­ment very quickly without feeling any disgust and pulling him out.Sagaramati, this example is given in order to make a certain mean­ing understood. What is to be regarded as the meaning1359 [illustrated by this example]? Sagaramati, “the pit of excrement” is a designation for [samsara] in its three realms. “The only son” is a designation for sentient beings. [For] bodhisattvas entertain the notion about all sen­tient beings that they are [like] their only son. “The mother and the rel­atives” {PI04a} is a designation for the persons who belong to the yanas of Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. [For] upon seeing sentient beings fallen into samsara, they wail and lament, but they are not able to pull them out. “The distinguished householder” is a designation for bodhi­sattvas who are pure and stainless, possess a mind that is free from stains, and have directly realized the unconditioned dharma {DIOOb} [but still] link up with [samsara] in its three realms for the sake of ma­turing sentient beings as they wish. Sagaramati, such is the great com­passion of bodhisattvas that they, despite being completely liberated from all fetters, again assume birth in [samsaric] existence. By virtue"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Maháyána 381of being skilled in means and being embraced by prajñá, they are not harmed1360 by [their own] afflictions and teach the dharma to sentient beings in order to relinquish all the fetters of their afflictions.”1361The instruction in this sütra passage explains the [tathágata elements] phase of being both im pure and pure because (1) bodhisattvas who have gained mastery for the sake of acting for the benefit of others connect with births in [samsáric] existence through the powers of their roots of virtue and of their compassion as they wish and (2) because they are not afflicted by this [samsáric existence] through the powers of their [skill in] means and prajñá.1362Here, the manner in which1363 bodhisattvas, upon having arrived at see­ing the lack of birth and the lack of arising of the tathágata element as it really is, attain that true nature of a bodhisattva should be understood in detail according to the [same] sütra, which says:Ságaramati, look at phenomena’s lack of an essence, lack of a creator, lack of an identity, lack of a sentient being, lack of a life force, {J49} lack of a person, and lack of an owner. {P104b} Indeed, they are [sim­ply] created as one wishes. Being thus created,1364 they do not think or imagine. Ságaramati, bodhisattvas who believe that phenomena are [thus] created1365 do not give rise to weariness1366 of any phenomenon. Their vision of wisdom is immaculate and pure, [seeing] that there is nothing here that causes benefit or harm. In this way, they know the true nature of phenomena as it really is and never cast off the armor of great compassion.O Ságaramati, suppose there were a priceless precious jewel of beryl, {DIOla} excellently polished, excellently pure, and excellently stainless. Suppose [this jewel] would be thrown into the mud and would remain there for a thousand years. After these thousand years have passed, it would be pulled out of the mud and would be washed and cleansed. Having been rinsed well, perfectly purified, and perfectly polished, it would never lose its nature of being such a pure and stainless precious jewel.Likewise, Ságaramati, bodhisattvas know the natural luminosity of the mind of sentient beings, but they [also] see that this [luminosity] is afflicted by adventitious proximate afflictions. Now, bodhisattvas think as follows, “These afflictions do not enter the natural luminosity of the mind of sentient beings. These afflictions are adventitious and are"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"382 Translationsproduced by false imagination. I am able to teach the dharma in order to remove the adventitious afflictions of these sentient beings.” In this way, a fainthearted state of mind never arises in them. [Instead,] with much greater intensity than such [potential faintheartedness] and in an immediate manner, they give rise to the mind-set for liberating all sentient beings. They also think thus, “These afflictions do not have any power or strength. These afflictions are powerless and of weak power. They have no real foundation. {150} These afflictions {PI05a} are false imagination. When examined with proper mental engagement that ac­cords with true reality, they do not stir.1367 We should scrutinize them in such a way that they may never adhere to us [again]. Indeed, it is good when the afflictions do not adhere, but it is not [good] when they do adhere. If the afflictions were to adhere to me, how could I teach the dharma for the sake of relinquishing the fetters of the afflictions of sentient beings who are bound by the fetters of the afflictions? Look, we will not adhere to the afflictions, so we shall teach the dharma to sentient beings in order to relinquish their fetters of the afflictions. {DIOlb} On the other hand, in order to mature sentient beings, we should adhere to those afflictions that connect us with samsara and are associated with roots of virtue.”1368Here, “samsara” implies the three bodies of a mental nature in the un­contaminated basic element that are a reflection of [the bodies of beings in] the three realms. This is [referred to as] samsara because it is formed by uncontaminated roots of virtue. It is also [referred to as] nirvana because it is not formed by contaminated karma and afflictions. W ith regard to this, [the Srimaladevisutra] says:Therefore, Bhagavan, there is both conditioned and unconditioned samsara. There is both conditioned and unconditioned nirvana.1369Now, this is called “the phase of being impure and pure” because it en­tails the operation of minds1370 and mental factors in which the conditioned and the unconditioned are mixed. Furthermore, this [phase] is primarily presented [as occurring] on the [sixth] bodhisattvabhumi, [called] “The Facing” for the following [two] reasons. [On this bhumi,] by virtue of hav­ing cultivated the unobstructed paramita of prajna, [bodhisattvas] face1371 the supernatural knowledge of the term ination of contaminations.1372 [On the other hand,] by virtue of having cultivated great compassion, {PI05b}"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"they do not directly realize [this supernatural knowledge of the termination of contaminations] in order to [remain in samsara and] protect all the basic elements of sentient beings.This is as described in the example of a city1373 for the wisdom of the termination of contaminations.1374Likewise, son of noble family, bodhisattvas give rise to the five super­natural knowledges through great effort, great vigor, and the firm culti­vation of the superior intention. With their minds purified by dhyânas and supernatural knowledges, they come to face [the wisdom of] the termination of contaminations. [However,] by virtue of having gener­ated the mind-set of great compassion, in order to protect all sentient beings, [instead of merging with the wisdom of the termination of contaminations, they consider sentient beings and therefore turn away from this wisdom and return, appearing even at the level of ordinary beings].1375[Thus,] having trained in the wisdom of the termination of contam ina­tions, {D102a} once again, {J51} by virtue of giving rise to unobstructed1376 prajñá through their excellently purified mind, on the sixth [bhümi] they come to face the termination of contaminations.1377In this way, they attain mastery over the direct realization of the term i­nation of contaminations on this bodhisattvabhümi [called] “The Facing.” Therefore, this is explained as the bodhisattvas’ phase [of the tathagata el­ements] being pure. [On the other hand,] by virtue of their character of correctly engaging [in the tathagata element] and due to their great com ­passion, thinking, “I shall establish others too in this same correct engage­ment,” they wish to protect sentient beings who engage in a wrong way. Having trained in the means for the bliss of peace without tasting it, out of consideration for sentient beings who are facing samsara, [bodhisattvas] who are facing nirvana1378 rise from the dhyânas [that they cultivate] for the sake of completing [all] the factors [concordant with] awakening and again assume birth in the desire realm as they wish. Therefore, wishing to promote the welfare of sentient beings as quickly as possible, {PI06a} they gain mastery over displaying the bodies of ordinary beings by way of [as­suming] different births [even] in the forms of various animals.

Indeed, there is no sentient being whatsoever in the realm of sentient beings that is outside of the tathagata- dharmakaya, just as form is [never outside of] the element of space. Thus, [the Mahdydnasutrdlamkara] says: {J71}Just as {PI 14b} space is asserted to be always omnipresent,This [buddhahood] is held to be always omnipresent.Just as space is omnipresent in the hosts of form,It is omnipresent in the hosts of sentient beings.1458Because of being changeless by nature,Because of being excellent, and because of being pure,Suchness is illustratedBy the analogy of a piece of gold. 1.148Though the mind is associated with infinite phenomena of affliction and suffering, by virtue of its natural luminosity, it does not undergo any change.1459 Therefore, it is called “suchness” in the sense of being unchangeable like excellent gold.

As [the Tathagata- garbhasütra] says:Son of noble family, this is the true nature of phenomena: no matter whether tathágatas arise or do not arise, these sentient beings always have the tathágata heart.1475Here, the nature of phenomena is the principle, the method, and the means through which1476 [it is clear that the true state of phenomena] is just such and that it is not otherwise.1477 In all respects, {D112b} this very nature of phenomena is the resort, and this very nature of phenom ena is the principle for the contemplation of the m ind and the realization of the m ind.1478 It is neither conceivable nor imaginable.

There is no way [for them to do so].(2)—(3) Now, those who are called “those who delight in what is m is­taken” are the árávakas and pratyekabuddhas. W hy is that? For though they should furthermore familiarize with the tathagata heart as being per­manent, they delight [only] in familiarizing with the notion of [all phe­nomena’s] being imperm anent instead of familiarizing with the notion of the [tathagata heart’s] being permanent. Though they should furthermore familiarize with the tathagata heart as being bliss, they delight [only] in familiarizing with the notion of [all phenomena’s being] suffering instead of familiarizing with the notion of the [tathagata heart’s] being blissful. {D113a} Though they should furthermore familiarize with the tathagata heart as being a self, they delight [only] in familiarizing with the notion of [all phenomena’s] lacking a self instead of familiarizing with the notion of the [tathagata heart’s] being a self. {PI 17b} Though they should further­more familiarize with the tathagata heart as being pure, they delight [only] in familiarizing with the notion of [all phenomena’s] being impure instead of familiarizing with the notion of the [tathagata heart’s] being pure. Thus, due to this sequence [of familiarizing with those four notions], they delight in the path that is adverse to1480 attaining the dharmakaya. Therefore, it is said that the basic element, which is characterized by supreme permanence, bliss, self, and purity, is not even the sphere of any árávakas and pratyeka­buddhas. That this [basic element] is not the sphere of those who delight in mistakenness (those who [entertain] the notions of impermanence, suffer­ing, lack of a self, and impurity) was accordingly established by the Bhaga- ván in detail in the M aháparinirvánasütra through the example of a jewel in the water of a pond:O bhiksus, it is as follows. Suppose that, at the time of the hot season, people were to hitch up their clothes for bathing and play in the water with their own ornaments and objects of pastime.

Eventually, someone there who is skilled and intelligent would actually retrieve that jewel.Bhiksus, likewise, not knowing the true reality of phenomena, which is like that jewel,1482 {D113b} you repeatedly meditate through all your clinging to everything as being impermanent, everything as being suffering, everything as being without a self, {PI 18a} and everything as being impure.

Due to the power of the previously committed virtuous karm a of the gods, without being played [by anybody], these [other"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 443instruments] too produce divine sounds pleasant to hear.” {J103} [They are not referred to here] because they are dissimilar to the Tathagata’s voice in terms of four kinds of qualities. W hat are these? They are as follows: being limited, not beneficial, unpleasant, and not conducive to deliverance. By contrast, the drum of dharm a is explained to be unlimited because it summons all the assemblies of heedless gods without exception {D124a} and never misses the [proper] time for [doing] so. It is beneficial because it protects [the gods] from being afraid of any harm [caused by] the hosts of their adversaries, such as the asuras, and because it connects them with the [crucial] point of heedfulness.1633 It is pleasant because it makes [the gods] abandon1634 the delight and pleasure due to wrong desire and because it brings them close to the [true] delight and pleasure of relishing the dharma. It is explained to be conducive to deliverance because it utters the sounds “impermanence,” “suffering,” “emptiness,” and “lack of self’ and because it pacifies misfortune and mental disturbance.In brief, by virtue of being similar to the drum of dharma through these four aspects, the sphere of the voice of the Buddha is most eminent. Thus, [there follows] a verse on the sphere of the voice of the Buddhas being most eminent.Since it is universal, beneficial, pleasant,And endowed with the three miraculous displays,1635 The voice of the sage is m ore em inent Than the divine cymbals. IV.36It should be understood that a brief instruction on these four aspects [P130a] [is given] in due order by the [following] four verses.The great sounds of the drum s in heavenDo not reach the hearing of those dwelling on earth,But the sound of the drum of the perfect Buddha1636 Reaches [even] those in the lowest region of samsara.1637 IV.37In heaven, the m any myriads of divine cymbals Sound [only] for the sake of kindling the flame of desire,But the single voice of those whose character is compassion Manifests for the sake of pacifying the cause of the fire of suffering.IV. 3 8 {J104}"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"444 TranslationsThe beautiful and pleasing sounds of the cymbals in heaven Axe the causes for increasing m ind’s agitation,But the voice of the magnanimous tathagatasEncourages the intention of entrusting the m ind to sam adhi.1638 IV.39In brief, what is the cause of happiness in [all]Infinite worldly realms, the celestial and the earthly,Is stated with reference to this voice that appears Pervasively in all worlds without exception. IV.40That the [Buddha] pervades all worldly realms in the ten directions without exception through assuming various physical forms indicates “the miraculous display of miraculous powers.” {D124b} That he illuminates the impenetrable mental conduct of all the sentient beings who belong to these [worlds]1639 through his wisdom of [knowing all] ways of the mind is “the miraculous display of pointing out.” That he gives instructions and directions about the path that is conducive to deliverance through the utterances of his voice is “the miraculous display of advice.”Thus, the sphere of the Buddha’s voice, like the element of space, is un­impeded and operates without limitation. Still, it is not perceived every­where in all aspects,1640 but this is not the flaw of the sphere of the Buddhas voice. In order to teach this [there follows] a verse on its being their own fault for those who are not aware of this [voice].1641Just as those deprived of ears do not hear subtle sounds And not all [sounds] become audible even for those w ith the divine ear,So the subtle dharma, the object of the m ost acute wisdom, {P130b} Becomes audible only for those whose m inds are not afflicted.

IV.50Since they realize that the suffering of gods is dying and the suffering of hum ans is searching [for objects of desire],Those with prajna do not even crave for the supreme powerful states among gods and humans.For through their prajna and by virtue of following their confidence1655 in the Tathagata’s words,They discriminate with wisdom, “This is suffering, this is [its] cause, and this is [its] cessation.”1656 IV.51Just as a disease is to be known, the cause of the disease is to be relinquished,The state of well-being is to be attained, and medicine is to be relied upon,"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"A Treatise on the Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayana 447Suffering, [its[ cause, its cessation, and likewise the path, respectively, Are to be known, to be relinquished, to be reached, and to be relied upon.

Therefore, they are not the [ultimate] refuge.1807 As for the Buddha, the two rùpakâyas are pitfalls— [the actual Buddha] refers to the taking of refuge that is the realization of ones own m ind as the dharmakàya. Ones own mind is without the triad of arising, abiding, and perishing and is unconditioned or luminous. W ithin that state, thoughts are apprehended as unreal, peaceful, and stainless,1808 while self-arisen wisdom is let be as being without speech, thought, and expression.1809(A2) As for the inner Buddha that is the dharmakàya of ones own mind, [the Uttaratantra says]:Ultimately, the refugeO f beings is the Buddha alone.1810Ones own mind free from the identification of all kinds of thoughts, characterized by the inseparability of the pair of the unconditioned expanse and self-arisen wisdom, whose nature is lucid and unceasing, is beyond [ordinary states of] mind.1811(A3) As for resolving [that ones mind] is the dharmakàya, the nature of the mind is the stainless dharmadhàtu, the dharmakàya.

The disposition endowed with qualitiesBl. [The stainless dharmakaya]This has three parts. The stainless dharmadhatu of ones own mind, by its very essence1816 beyond [ordinary states of] mind and inconceivable by thoughts, is the instruction beyond expression on the definitive meaning, that is, the profound that is of one taste. Though this mind—the nature of phenomena free from speech, thought, and expression—is expressed by all kinds of yánas [in different ways], regard it as the definitive meaning of the heart of the matter, luminous m ind as such. There are three guid­ing instructions about this dharmakaya. First, the m inds appearing as all kinds of thoughts is the means. This being free from identification is pra- jñá. M inds appearing but being without nature, lucid yet without clinging, is the nondual path. This is [how to] rest in the dharmakaya first. In be­tween, if thoughts arise, their being examined by prajñá is the indication of profundity. In the end, letting them be as lucid wisdom in an uncontrived manner is the indication of guidance through means.B2. Suchness not changing through thoughtsThis has three parts. (B2a) W ith regard to guidance through examples, as the example for [suchness’s] being changeless, consider the sky—no matter how much dust and smoke may arise [in it], the sky is not tainted. Thoughts are like this example. As the example for [suchnesss] being untainted, con­sider gold—gold is not tainted by a film and stains [on it], which are like thoughts. As the example for [suchness’s] being pure, consider water—if water is not muddied, [this resembles suchness’s] not being muddied by thoughts.1817(B2b) Guidance through the meaning is sixfold. (1) At the time of being a sentient being, the true nature of the m ind—suchness—does not change into the stains in its essence, no matter which afflictions and thoughts may arise. If suchness became the stains of thoughts, one would not become"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"476 Translationsa buddha. (2) At the time of being a buddha, [suchness] does not change into qualities—there is no enhancement in the essence of the dharmakaya, which is self-arisen wisdom. If there were, one would not become a bud­dha through the path. (3)-(4) The stainless true nature of the m ind is not tainted by flaws at the time of being a sentient being, nor is it tainted by qualities at the time of being a buddha. [As the Uttaratantra says:]There is nothing to be removed in thisAnd not the slightest to be added.1818[And:]Similarly, with the treasure of jewels lodged within the m ind,1819 {416}Whose true nature is stainless and without anything to be added or removed,Not being realized, all these beings continuously experienceThe suffering of being destitute in many ways.1820(5) Sentient beings are the adventitious flaws of thoughts. Therefore, one familiarizes with them as being nonentities. (6) Buddhahood is ones own m inds being stainless of these adventitious stains of thoughts.1821 [Thus,] one familiarizes with this luminosity of ones own mind.(B2c) You may wonder, “How does one familiarize [with this]?” [One does so through] the three inconceivable [ways of] taking these very [guiding instructions] as the path. (1) At the time of being a sentient be­ing, suchness is naturally pure and the essence of the m ind is real as self­arisen wisdom. Through [minds] not recognizing its own face, the stains of thoughts arise, which is inconceivable. W hat one makes a living expe­rience is thoughts being pointed out to be unidentifiable. (2) At the time of being a buddha, naturally stainless mind is real as self-arisen wisdom. Through [minds] recognizing its own face, it is free from the adventitious stains of thoughts, which is inconceivable purity. One makes this certainty about natural luminosity a living experience. (3) The [tathàgata] heart—the dharmakaya, self-arisen wisdom—is without distinction in buddhas and sentient beings. Its essence—alpha-pure ultimate1822 luminosity—is the in­conceivable nature. The temporary lack of realizing the true nature of the m ind is its inconceivable appearance as all kinds of thoughts and flaws for sentient beings. The realization of the true nature of the mind is its incon­ceivable appearance as the kâyas and wisdoms for buddhas. [Thus,] natural"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 477luminosity is to be resolved through the view, temporarily to be made a living experience through familiarization, and thereafter one should train in compassion and bodhicitta.B3. The disposition endowed with qualitiesThis has five parts. (B3a) The luminosity of ones own mind is the dispo­sition for the dharmakaya. Since it abides primordially and by nature as buddhahood, it is not that something nonexistent is accomplished. There is not the slightest buddhahood to be added apart from1823 the realization of ones own mind. (B3b) To realize thoughts as being adventitious is the sam- bhogakàya. (B3c) The arising of compassion for those who do not realize this is the nirmânakàya.1824 (B3d) By virtue of the wisdom of realizing the two rüpakàyas, which is the supreme accomplished disposition, [luminos­ity] is free from the stains of thoughts—the buddhahood that is the dawn of realization is unceasing. Through realizing ones own mind, there is not the slightest to be removed because there is no sentient being to be relin­quished apart from [minds] playing as thoughts without a basis. (B3e) [The Uttaratantra says]:It is held that the three kâyas are attainedBy virtue of these two dispositions.1825Therefore, through that, at the time of recognizing ones own mind as the inseparability of the expanse and wisdom, the following kind of experience arises. Since ones own minďs being unidentifiable (the expanse) and its being lucid and unceasing (wisdom) are inseparable, {417} the characteristics [of minds nature] are beyond [ordinary states of] mind. Therefore, without thoughts and clinging, [all] that appears and exists dawns as the essence of the three kâyas. This has three parts. (1) The nature of the mind is the dharmakáya—the essence of the minds of all sentient beings in the three realms is real as luminosity. (2) The arising of ones own realization of this actuality through instructions and familiarization is the sambhogakàya. Through that, though [this luminosity] itself may arise as all kinds of thoughts, one realizes that their essence lacks a root.(3) The arising of compassion without deliberately familiarizing with apprehending the conceptual cognitions of m ind to be independent real entities is the nirmânakàya. Through various means, this is what arises in the mind stream [as] the bodhicitta that is associated with the thoughts of"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"478 Translationssentient beings. Those are [the ways of] bringing the naturally luminous [tathàgata] heart onto the path to buddhahood.[As the reverse side of these ways of the three kâyas manifesting,] these [ways also] represent the three paths of temporary adventitious stains' not being real: (1) bringing the cause that looks like the basic element onto the path, (2) bringing the condition that looks like awakening onto the path, and (3) bringing the fruition—the intrinsic three kâyas—onto the path.(1) [As for bringing the cause that looks like the basic element onto the path,] the basic element represents the natural bringing onto the path: (a) its spontaneously being present as the dharmakàya (self-arisen buddha­hood), (b) its arising as nonconceptual self-aware wisdom, and (c) through being liberated in that way, the mind stream's becoming pure and the dis­position, which is the path of the noble ones, being perfected in the mind.(la) The dharmakàya (stainless self-arisen buddhahood) is sponta­neously present in the sheath of the lotus of desire. However, since the adventitious stains (the objects of fixating thoughts) are not real, there is no mental clinging. [This means] to bring the essence of the mind onto the path as being beyond [ordinary states of] mind.(lb) As for [the essence of the m ind’s] arising as nonconceptual self- aware wisdom, the dharmakàya in the enclosure of the bees of hatred re­sembles honey. It is self-luminous as the mind of uncontaminated prajnà whose essence is to be free from reference points. That is, without the ad­ventitious stain of lacking faith in the dharma, one brings certainty onto the path through the triad of scriptures, reasoning, and pith instructions. As for the self-awareness of this wisdom, the vast dharmakàya exists like a grain in the sheath of the husks of dullness, which is to be relinquished. This means to bring the dharma that becomes the remedy for the afflictions onto the path.(lc) As for liberated self-awareness, the m ind stream's becoming pure, the suchness of the mind (natural liberation) abides like gold in the enclo­sure of each one of the manifest three poisons of the afflictions arising. This means to bring thoughts onto the path as being without a basis, just like clouds or smoke in the sky. As for the disposition, which is the path of the noble ones, those of sharp faculties understand this, their own mind, as being natural buddhahood, that is, through the three natural trainings, they master the level of arhathood. [As for the three natural trainings,] that mind's nature is not tainted by the stains of thoughts is [the training in] discipline. Self-arisen self-luminous wisdom is the training in mind [or samàdhi]. Its essence of being free from reference points is [the training"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 479in] prajnâ. {418} Through realizing the essence of ones own mind as being arhathood or buddhahood in this way, the attachment of clinging to ad­ventitious wrongdoing and mental desires as well as [all] coarse and subtle thoughts of fixating on appearances as being real cease. This is the wisdom of learning.These two [the suchness of the m ind and the disposition that is the path of the noble ones] are the two dispositions—they are the naturally abiding disposition and the supreme accomplished disposition. As for the disposi­tions for the three kâyas, ones own m ind exists as the cause of the essence of the dharmakaya of a buddha. To lack clinging to thoughts as being en­tities is generosity. Not being tainted by thoughts is discipline. The natural nonarising [of thoughts] is patience. Nonreferential virtue is vigor. Being undistracted is dhyána. [Minds] essence free from reference points is pra- jna. The realization that the six páramitás are naturally perfected represents the first bhùmi. The second [disposition] is the realization that thoughts are adventitious and not real, which represents [the disposition for] the sam- bhogakâya. It is attained from the second up through the seventh bhùmis through the six pàramitàs of realizing that however self-arisen wisdom may appear, it is enjoyed as the nature of phenomena. The third [disposition for the nirmànakàya] is the certainty that all sentient beings who do not realize [this] are naturally buddhas. Through compassion s arising for those who are temporarily bound through their own thoughts of suffering in samsara, the three [pure bhùmis] such as the eighth bhùmi are attained.By virtue of not engaging in cognitions of clinging to thoughts as being real, those of highest faculties understand that mind is natural buddha­hood. Those of medium faculties understand that thoughts are not real but are self-arisen wisdom, through which they master the appearances of the buddhahood of realization. Though those of lowest faculties know that thoughts are not real, they are born under the influence of clinging. There­fore, they understand the buddhahood of having cultivated clinging and grasping through having familiarized with self-arisen wisdom, that is, they complete the five paths in their minds on a single seat. As for how the five paths arise on a single seat, the path of accumulation consists of knowing that thoughts are not real. The path of preparation is to know that the fac­tors to be relinquished through seeing are not real. The path of seeing is to know that the factors to be relinquished through familiarization are not real. The path of familiarization is to know that the cognitive obscurations are not real. The buddhabhùm i is the liberation without relinquishing the"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"48o Translationstwo obscurations. Thus, the five [types of] thoughts [to be relinquished on the path] are cut through.(2) As for taking the condition that looks like awakening as the path, the conditions for the dharmakaya of ones own mind becoming free from the stains of thoughts are the five paths. On the path of accumulation, one’s own m ind is pointed out as luminosity. That is, the realization that innate ignorance is reversed is the cause of buddhahood. On the path of prepara­tion, one familiarizes with what was pointed out. That is, by virtue of the clinging to ones own mind stream as being a self’s having perished, the realization of [what] the views about a real personality [are] is the condi­tion for buddhahood. The realization of luminous mind on the path of seeing is the dharmakaya. {419} On the path of familiarization with its ten bhümis, one [still] needs efforts to realize luminous mind, which represents the sambhogakàya. On the final path, although self-arisen wisdom has been seized within oneself, one has the welfare of others in mind, which rep­resents the nirmânakàya.With regard to this, [there are] five essential points about the condi­tion [that looks like awakening]. On the path of accumulation, through luminosity’s having been pointed out, one knows that the ground of latent tendencies—ignorance—is not real, which represents arhathood. On the path of preparation, one knows that clinging to a self is not real, which rep­resents [the path of] learning [of bodhisattvas]. The realization of the dhar­makáya represents [the object condition of] the first bhümi; the realization of the sambhogakàya, [the object condition of the following] six bhümis; and the realization of the nirmânakàya, the object condition of the [last] three bhümis. Through realizing that just as the factors to be relinquished and realization are not real, mind-made wisdom is not real [either], the five paths are perfected in the mind.(3) As for the intrinsic fruition, the stains such as the sheath of a lotus are nine. The realization of the nature of the mind, which arises in oneself as desire [and so on], represents the dharmakáya.1826 The understanding that the adventitious stains of desire [and so on] lack a real essence but are empty represents the sambhogakàya. The arising of compassion for [all] sentient beings who do not realize [this] is [called] “bringing the dhar­makáya onto the path.”C. The conditions’ being condensed in the BuddhaThe focal object is awakening, that is, through having realized the lumi­nosity of one’s own mind, one familiarizes [with it] by focusing on the"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 481awakening that is without the stains of thoughts. W hen awakening is at­tained, [its] qualities represent the dom inant condition—through having attained mastery over the two [sets of] qualities that represent ones own welfare and the welfare of others, one is like Dhanapati.1827 Enlightened activity represents the immediate condition—wherever beings to be guided with pure mind streams are, the promotion of their welfare takes place im ­mediately without being interrupted in terms of place or time.These are the six essential points of bringing [mind's luminosity] onto the path:18281. Pointing out the cause that is the basic element (the essential point of the disposition)18292. Pointing out the fruition that is the dharmakàya (the essential point of awakening)3. Pointing out the dharmakàya (the essential point of the qualities of freedom)4. Pointing out the rüpakàyas (the essential point of [the qualities of] maturation)5. Enlightened activity's being nonconceptual (the essential point of prajñá)6. [Enlightened activity's] being uninterrupted (the essential point of compassion)(C l-2) First, through the ninefold matching of the [tathàgata] heart [with its adventitious stains through the nine examples in the Uttaratantra], sentient beings (the cause) and buddhas (the fruition) are joined, that is, the three phases [of the tathàgata heart's being impure, impure and pure, and completely pure] are blended as having a single nature. The three phases are the luminosity of the dharmakàya of sentient beings (which is like the space in a clay vessel), the luminosity of the noble ones (which is like the space in a copper vessel), and the luminosity of buddhas (which is like the space in a golden vessel). As for these three [phases, the Uttaratantra says]:The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.1830The conditioned element that can be disconnected1831 consists of the stains of thoughts, which are like a vessel. As for what is naturally inseparable, just as space is without difference [in different vessels], the luminous essence of"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"482 Translationsthe mind {420} is without difference in both sentient beings and buddhas. [The Uttaratantra continues:]It is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.1832The unconditioned basic element that cannot be disconnected consists of the stainless nature of the mind, which is like space. [The explanation of] this has eight parts.(C l-2a) As for identifying its essence, buddhahood is the self-arisen wisdom, in which thoughts have been relinquished, dawning in the mind stream through realizing natural luminosity.(C l-2b) As for eliminating obstacles with regard to the cause, the cause for sentient beings not attaining buddhahood consists of the conceptions of the two obscurations, but nonconceptual wisdom1833 identifies this lumi­nosity of ones own mind as self-arisen buddhahood. To determine through the instructions that these two [points] are inseparable from ones own m ind is to familiarize with the changeless nature of phenomena. One gives rise to the certainty that it is inconceivable in that it is beyond [ordinary states of] m ind because dialecticians do not realize it. If the afflictions are at peace by virtue of the adventitious thoughts in ones own [mind stream's] having been scrutinized by1834 nonconceptual wisdom, there is no effort.1835 Subsequently, without the essence of the dharmakaya s stirring [in any way whatsoever], whatever appears for the wisdom of ones own pure mind stream displays as an indication of the dharmakaya. [In this way,] the two kayas dawn for those who are suitable. As ones own welfare, one realizes the uncontrived nature of phenomena by virtue of the [tathagata] hearts (the cause) being free from stains.As for the pair of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, first, at the time of basic awarenesss (rigpa) being pointed out, one directs [the mind] toward this basic awareness (the space-like nature of phenomena), scrutinizes1836 thoughts, and rests in unconditioned [basic awareness]. [During] subsequent [attainment], one lets one's own unconditioned mind, self-arisen wisdom, be in an uncontrived manner.Second, at the time of basic awareness's entering the path, during med­itative equipoise, one rests in assessing [how to] separate the pure essence from the dross1837 in terms of the pair that consists of the stains of thoughts and luminous self-arisen wisdom. [During] subsequent [attainment], there"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 483dawns the experiential appearance of the self-arisen wisdom of ones own mind and the stains of thoughts being inseparable.Third, as for wisdom s seizing its own ground, during meditative equi­poise, one scrutinizes thoughts w ith1838 [some] effort. [During] subsequent [attainment], the luminous nature of phenomena is realized. This rep­resents the level of these two [meditative equipoise and subsequent attain­ment] being inseparable in essence. As for thoughts not [needing to] be relinquished and being pure, [the Uttaratantra says:]There is nothing to be removed in this.1839As for self-arisen wisdom s dawning without [needing] to be accomplished, [the text says]:And not the slightest to be added.1840Therefore, that the essence of the m ind dawns on its own as self-arisen wisdom is the nonconceptual [wisdom of meditative equipoise]. The true nature of subsequent attainment is that [any] clinging to appearing objects as being real is at peace. The gist of this is that it is said that self-arisen wisdom s dawning on its own in an uncontrived manner is the nonconcep­tual [wisdom of meditative equipoise]. To gain mastery over appearances through this and thus to be able to remove1841 [all] thoughts of delusion is the subsequent knowledge. It is stated that this is an important guiding instruction.Fourth, as for the self-arisens being pointed out, [during meditative equipoise,] one needs to search for1842 the reality of thoughts, and the af­termath [of that] is the realization of the lucid nature of phenomena as being like space. [Thus,] on the path, one familiarizes with separating the pure essence from the dross with regard to basic awareness. {421} The pure essence is self-arisen wisdom, and the dross consists of thoughts—ordinary cognitions.1843 The fruition is the twofold separation of the pure essence from the dross with regard to basic awareness—self-arisen wisdom s ability to stand its own ground being the nonconceptual [wisdom of meditative equipoise] and the ability to cope with [all kinds of] circumstances through having mastered appearances being subsequent [attainment]. [Thus] it is said.(C l-2c) As for connecting this with the fruition, [the fruition] is the stainless wisdom of the [tathagata] heart that is the dharmakaya—the"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"484 Translationswisdom of having seemingly attained the changeless [tathagata] heart that is suchness and the abiding [tathagata] heart that is the disposition. In this [context], at the time of the cause, self-arisen wisdom, being obscured by three [kinds of] stains,1844 abides as the basic element. At the time of the conditions, the self-arisen wisdom that is free from the stains is the fruition.As for blending these two [times], first, meditative equipoise consists of examining the stains of thoughts, and subsequent [attainment] consists of regarding them as the stainless nature of phenomena. In between, at the time of training on the path, [meditative equipoise] consists of immedi­ately cutting through [all] coarse and subtle stains of thoughts in it, and subsequent [attainment] consists of taking the bare nature of phenomena as the path. [This means] to know how to separate the pure essence from the dross with regard to the pair of luminous basic awareness and thoughts. Third, when [wisdom] has seized its own ground, during meditative equi­poise, self-arisen wisdom effortlessly dawns on its own without being ob­scured by thoughts. [During] subsequent [attainment], due to not being harmed by appearances, [wisdom] is mastered through the path without being subdued by bad circumstances. Therefore, one finally resolves that ones own mind is buddhahood.1845(C l-2d) As for accomplishing the welfare of [enlightened] activity, ones own welfare is the attainment of the vimuktikàya. That is, through realiz­ing ones own mind, thoughts are relinquished. Through wisdom s shining like the sun, thoughts play as self-arisen wisdom. As for the purified dhar­makaya accomplishing the welfare of others, just as space, the dharmakaya is without arising and perishing and thus provides space. Through its being pervaded by the sun of self-arisen wisdom free from the clouds of the ob­scurations, it performs the activity of the arising of wisdom in the mind streams of the suitable ones in whose mind streams the path has arisen.(Cl-2e) As for the qualities (the purpose), the inconceivable luminosity of ones own mind is the dharmakaya. It lacks birth as a body of a mental nature and also lacks the inconceivable death, the sickness of latent ten­dencies, and the aging [through] uncontaminated karma.1846 It is the ulti­mate reality of cessation. Through the wisdoms of suchness and variety, the three obscurations of thoughts1847 are relinquished. [Thus,] the three kâyas are attained.The final resolve consists of (C l-2f) resolving the manifestation of [minds] nature, (Cl-2g) resolving [its] everlasting state, and (C l-2h) [re­solving its] inconceivable characteristics."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 485(C l-2f) First, the [following] three [points] represent the manifestation as the profound dharmakaya: the nature of one's own mind's being the triad of its characteristic (being unconditioned), its heart (the inseparability of samsara and nirvana), and its essence (the relinquishment of extremes);1848 the threefold relinquishment of the stains of thoughts through realizing this; and nonconceptual wisdom—the nature of self-arisen wisdom—shin­ing clearly as the nature of phenomena.1849 As for the vast sambhogakaya, in pure mind streams, it is this very dharmakaya that appears [as] the sam­bhogakaya, just as the m oon in the sky. {422} In impure mind streams, the nirmanakaya manifests as the magnanimity that guides naive beings.1850(Cl-2g) [That the dharmakaya and the rupakayas are] perm anent1851 states is made a living experience through seven and three [reasons, respectively].(C l-2h) [The explanation of] inconceivability has six parts.

Pointing out the dharmakaya (the essential point of [the qualities of] freedom)At the time when one's own m ind—the dharmakaya, which is like a pre­cious jewel—is free from the stains of thoughts, the light of the powers, the color of the fearlessnesses, and the shape of the unique [buddha quali­ties]1854 are its inseparable qualities.1855C4. Pointing out the rupakayas (the essential point of [the qualities of] maturation)It is the very wisdom of the dharmakaya that appears as the sambhogakaya in pure mind streams and as the nirmanakaya in impure mind streams. To recognize that what appears as a buddhakaya is an appearance of one's mind is the sambhogakaya. W hat appears as an independent buddha is the nirmanakaya. If this is described [in such a way], it is convenient. The"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"486 Translationsm aturation [of the rupakayas] is explained to be [their] mere effortless manifestation, being the [resultant] appearance of [buddhas] previously having attained mastery over form [through] the samadhi and prajna of the dharmakaya. The appearances of buddhakayas are included in all [pos­sible] appearances1856 of all three ways of guiding sentient beings—in virtu­ous, nonvirtuous, and neutral [ways].C5. Enlightened activity’s being nonconceptual (the essential point of prajna)At the time of realizing the dharmakaya of one’s own luminous mind, it is not that wisdom becomes nonexistent due to the extinction of thoughts. Rather, buddhas are endowed with self-arisen wisdom in their minds due to [all] stains of thoughts being at peace, and then appear to teach the path by virtue of their aspiration prayers and compassion. Through vajra-like wisdom,1857 buddhas have relinquished the cognitive obscurations—by vir­tue of [any] cognition in which subtle ignorance exists being terminated, the continuum of cognition is severed through wisdom1858 and thus the dharmakaya abides free from reference points, just like space. W ithout re­alizing the meaning of the m inds [making] aspiration prayers, [some] say that it is like a wish-fulfilling tree. This is not the case. Through [assuming that] there is no difference between the peace of sravakas and the single path to travel, it would follow that outer referents represent independent matter. Also, what appears as the two kayas for sentient beings1859 and the continuum of the wisdom of the ten bhumis would be equal. Furthermore, [the line] “Masterful [virtue] cannot be exhausted through the subsiding of the skandhas” [in the M ahdyanasutralamkara]mo says that due to the ex­haustion of thoughts, wisdom is inexhaustible in that it does not cease.1861 Therefore, [the above statement] is not the case.1862C6. [Enlightened activity’s] being uninterrupted (the essential point of compassion)[This point] applies to seeing buddhas and sentient beings as equal and so on.1863This completes the explanation of the stainless basic element.{423}.. ,1864"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 487It may be said, “This is not the case—if entities abide by being established as ignorance, what valid cognition that invalidates the explicit statement is there?” The Lahkavatarasutra says:Though beginningless, [samsara] entails an end.W hat is naturally pure and possesses permanent dharmas1865Is not seen [since] it is externally obscured by a beginningless cocoon,Just as a golden images being obscured.1866The Tathagatagarbhasutra states that “all sentient beings possess the tathagata heart.”1867 Therefore, [the explicit statement] is invalidated by [these quotations from the scriptures]. This represents the manner of introducing this explanation [of the Uttaratantra].You may wonder, “If this is explained, in what manner is it explained?” It consists of:1. The explanation of the name of the treatise2. The explanation of the meaning of the treatise that possesses this name.18681. The explanation of the nam e of the treatiseSince [this text] is taught in accordance with the meaning of the name of the treatise, this name is explained [first]. Here, mahayana in the San­skrit language [means] “great vehicle.” U ttara [means] “ultimate.” Tantra [means] “continuum.” Sastra1869 [means] “treatise.” As for the mahayana, the Madhyantavibhagatika explains that “the mahayana is a Vehicle be­cause one proceeds through it. . . . ‘Great’ [refers to] its being endowed with the seven greatnesses.”1870 In this context, the Mahdydnasutrdlamkara explains:Due to vastness and due to profundity,M aturation and nonconceptuality [occur].Therefore, these two are taught in this [mahayana],W hich is the means for the unsurpassable.1871Therefore, since [the Uttaratantra] teaches the subject matter that consists of the profound and vast seven vajra points, it represents the mahayana.It may be said, “In general, ‘tantra’ refers to words spoken by the Bud­dha, but after the body of the teacher had passed into nirvana, [treatises] were composed by persons of later generations in order to determine the"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"488 Translationsmeaning of his words. Therefore, [the terms] ‘tantra' and ‘treatise are m u­tually exclusive.” Since [the term] “mutually exclusive” is considered with regard to a single subject [in question], it is not considered with regard to different subjects [in question]. It is considered with regard to a single time, but it is not considered with regard to different times. Since it is considered with regard to two [phenomena] that actually fulfill their definitions, it is not considered with regard to two [phenomena among which one] actually fulfills its definition and [the other one] is [only] nominal. Here, if both were [tantra in the sense of] actually fulfilling the definition [of tantra], they would be mutually exclusive. However, in this case here, [the desig­nation of the Uttaratantra as] “tantra” is nominal, while it is a treatise that actually fulfills the definition [of a treatise]. Therefore, there is no mutual exclusion.You may wonder, “Something nominal needs [to possess] the three cri­teria [of being nominal].1872 Therefore, what purpose is there for labeling [this treatise] as ‘tantra'? W hat is the reason for labeling it? If it is a nominal [tantra] and does not actually fulfill the definition [of tantra],1873 what valid cognition is there that invalidates the explicit [expression ‘tantra']?” As for the purpose, though it is not a tantra, through labeling it as “tantra,” those who have faith in the tantras will engage in this treatise merely on the basis of its name. On the one hand, in terms of entities, this is a treatise, but {424} since it is present with the label “Uttaratantra,” [others] will realize that this treatise teaches an unsurpassable eminent meaning and thus en­gage in it with confidence and respect. The first are the persons who follow their confidence and will engage [a treatise] merely on the basis of its name. The second are the persons who follow the dharma and will engage [a trea­tise] through realizing the meaning expressed through its name by way of [hearing or seeing] this name because persons of sharp faculties realize merely on the basis of the name of a treatise what subject matter it teaches.As for the reason for labeling [this treatise “tantra”], it is a tantra in the sense of resembling a tantra. You may wonder, “How is that?” [There are] two [resemblances]. A tantra is a tantra in the sense of being concealed, hidden, or secret, that is, it is presented [as “tantra”] by keeping it secret from those who are not [proper] vessels. Likewise, if this treatise is taught to those who are not [proper] vessels (those who have the dispositions of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and those with the cut-off disposition), fear will arise [in them]. Therefore, it is presented by keeping it hidden or se­cret from them. Or, in tantra there is the triad of causal tantra, fruitional tantra, and method tantra. Likewise, in this treatise, what resembles the"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 489causal tantra is the basic element. W hat resembles the method tantra are the means to purify this [basic element]: awakening, the qualities, and en­lightened activity. What resembles the fruitional tantra are the three jewels. Therefore, [this treatise] is labeled [“tantra”] by taking its resemblance [to tantra in those ways] as the reason [for doing so].1874“Ultimate” [means] unsurpassable and eminent because it teaches the meaning of the sutra collection of definitive meaning that is difficult to realize—the seven vajra points.In the Madhyantavibhagatika, [the term] “treatise” is explained through the triad of the essence, the hermeneutic etymology, and the defining char­acteristic of “treatise.”1875 Here, in the Sanskrit language, there is [the term] “sastra.” If pronounced {with] a brief {.first “a”], it assumes fthe meaning] “weapon.” If pronounced [with] a long [first “a”], through adding a dia­critic sign,1876 it assumes [the meaning] “treatise.” Taking [its first syllable] sa[s]- as sdsana, [this syllable means] “teaching.” Taking [its second syl­lable] -tra as tray ana, [this syllable] means “protecting.” The meaning of that [explanation] is this: through teaching the unmistaken meaning of the mahayana—the seven vajra points—to disciples with the mahayana dispo­sition, the minds of these disciples are set right and thus these disciples are protected from falling into lower yanas.2.

This [dharma] is twofold: the dharma of realization that is cessation (due to being that which is to be realized) and the dharma of realization that is the path (due to being that through which this is realized). The first one is the nature of phenomena that exists throughout the phases during which the respectively appropriate [portions of the] afflictions are relinquished through the path of seeing and the path of familiarization. The second one consists of the path of seeing and the path of familiarization, which [here] refer to the meditative equipoises [of these paths], which in turn refer to their respective uninterrupted paths. The [dharma] also possesses eight qualities. “Through what does one know this?” They are explained [in verse 1.10] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:By virtue of its being inconceivable, free from the dual, nonconceptual,Pure, luminous, and a remedial factor,It is what is and what makes free from attachment, respectively—The dharma that is characterized by the two realities.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. The essence of the samghaThe seeming samgha consists of the four pairs of individuals or the eight persons [in the srâvakayàna and pratyekabuddhayâna]. Since one can ven­erate them and render services to them with body and mind, they are not a vajra point that1880 is difficult to realize. Rather [the third vajra point] is the ultimate samgha—the medium [persons] who are irreversible, the bodhi- sattvas dwelling on the ten bhümis.1881 [However,] this [samgha] is not"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"492 Translationspresented as the mere bodies [of these bodhisattvas] that are established on the basis of flesh and blood. [Rather, this samgha] has the essence of two qualities or wisdoms. “Through what {426} does one know this?” They are explained [in verse 1.14] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:Because of the purity of the inner Wisdom vision of suchness and variety,The assembly of the irreversible intelligent ones Is endowed with unsurpassable qualities.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. The essence of the basic elementIt is the nature of phenomena free from superimposition and denial. “Through what does one know this?” It is explained [in verse 1.157] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.5. The essence of awakeningSince the awakening of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is not a vajra point, [the fourth vajra point] is the unsurpassable awakening [of a buddha]. It possesses eight qualities or characteristics. “Through what does one know this?” They are explained [in verse II. 1] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:[Buddhahood] is purity, attainment, freedom,Ones own welfare and that of others, the foundation of this,And profundity, vastness, and magnanimityFor as long as time lasts and in accordance [with beings].2.1.1.1.1.1.1.6. The essence of the qualitiesThe qualities based on the dharmakaya are the thirty-two qualities of free­dom, and the qualities based on the rupakayas are the thirty-two qualities of maturation. “Through what does one know this?” They are stated [in verse III. 1] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 493Ones own welfare and the welfare of others consist of the ultimate kaya And the seeming kaya that is based on it, respectively.They are the results of freedom and maturation That are these qualities, which are classified as sixty-four.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.7. The essence of enlightened activity This is twofold: effortless enlightened activity and uninterrupted enlight­ened activity. In [the Uttaratantras] presentation in five aspects,1882 the first one [is said to] operate in a nonconceptual manner. “Through what does one know this?” This is explained [in verse IV. 1] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:The all-pervading lord always engages without effortIn the constitutions of those to be guided, the means to guide them,The activities of guidance that1883 [suit] the constitutions of those to be guided,And in arriving at the [proper] place and time for this [activity].The second one is the uninterrupted promotion of the welfare of sentient beings through making them understand the six fields of knowledge.1884 “Through what does one know this?” This is explained [in verse IV.5] in the detailed explanation of the branches [below]:For [this activity] lacks conceptions About deliverance, the support of that,The result of that, taking hold of that,The obscurations of that, and the condition for cutting through them.18852.1.1.1.1.1.2. The reason for their num ber’s being definite For those with the mahayana disposition, who strive for or wish to attain the fruition that is buddhahood, [the seven vajra points] are definite as the pair of causes and results. The three jewels are the results for which the remaining four [points] are the causes. You may wonder, “Why are the re­sults presented as three?” It is in terms of [the Buddha, the dharma, and the samgha] being the teacher of the path, the path’s own essence, and the companions while practicing it, respectively, {427} that [the results] are presented [as three] in this order. For example, this is similar to the triad of a skilled physician, excellent medicine, and a skilled nurse being necessary"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"494 Translationswhen a skilled physician is curing a sick person. In due order, [these three] match the three jewels.You may wonder, “W hat certainty is there about the number of causes being presented as four?” In the commentary on [Uttaratantra I.26ab] “Be­cause of what is to be realized, realization, its branches ...,” it is explained:Due to these four1886 topical points comprising everything to be known,they are definite as four.1887It may be asked, “Well, do they comprise what is to be known by way of detailed elaboration or do they comprise it by way of summarizing it? In the first case, since all seven [vajra points] are not included in these [last four], they are too few [to cover everything to be known]. In the second case, since [these four] are included in the basic element alone, there is the flaw of their being too many.” It is not like that because “what is to be known” refers to the three jewels (the results) and “comprise” to [the causes] that produce these three results—if there were more than four [causes], they would be unnecessary, and if there were fewer, they would not be suffi­cient. “How is it that if there were more, they would be unnecessary and if there were fewer, they would not be sufficient?” For the production of the results that are the three jewels, both a substantial cause and cooperating conditions are necessary, just as the [substantial] cause of a seed and the conditions of a field and so on are necessary for the production of the result that is a sprout. Here, in the commentary on [I.26ab] “Because of what is to be realized, realization, its branches ...,” it is explained that the substantial cause is the basic element “due to its being the seed of the supramundane attributes.” The conditions are the remaining three [vajra points]. “W hy are three conditions necessary for this?” The actual condition is enlightened activity. Since it arises based on the qualities, the qualities are necessary [too]. Since the [qualities] arise from awakening, awakening is [also] neces­sary. How these three function as conditions will be explained below in the section on the manner in which [the last four vajra points] serve as [one] substantial cause and [three] cooperating conditions.1888Now, what is to be explained is [the following:]2.1.1.1.1.1.3. The reason for their order’s being definite In general, order is of two [kinds]. This one is not an order of arising be­cause if it were, the four [vajra points] that are the cause and the condi­tions would come first and the three that are the results would come later."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 495Rather, [the order of the seven vajra points] is the order of clear realization in terms of the arising of the path. Therefore, the results that are the three jewels are realized through teaching that they possess [certain] qualities be­cause [thereby] enthusiasm for these results will arise and thus one will assiduously engage in its cause. [Thus,] the three jewels are taught first, and then the four that are the cause and its conditions are taught.You may wonder, “W hy are the results that are the three jewels taught in such an order?” This is [their] order of arising. After a bhagavan like1889 Prince Siddhartha has attained the complete and perfect awakening to the equality of all phenomena, the dharma of excellently turning the wheel of dharma arises from him. Therefore, {428} the Buddha is explained first, and then the dharma is explained. That [wheel of] dharma is not turned for the earth nor is it turned for stones, but it is turned for the samgha. Since it happens that [the Buddha] is endowed with limitless very disciplined as­semblies of disciples, after the [dharma], the samgha is explained.1890Since the results that are the three jewels are present as being endowed with [certain] qualities in this way, they do not arise without causes or without conditions. Therefore, the realization [of the three jewels] arises from1891 [their] causes and conditions. It is due to wondering, “W hat are the causes and conditions for attaining them?” that the four [vajra points] that are the cause and the conditions [for them] are taught thereafter. “W hy is the order of these four taught as it is?” The commentary on [the jewel of] the dharma explains:So all aspects of the afflictiveness of afflictions, karma, and birth of naive beings operate by virtue of not realizing and not seeing the single basic element in just the way it is in true reality.1892Therefore, if this basic element that exists in ones own mind stream is realized, the three [kinds of] afflictions are relinquished and thus the three jewels will be attained. Hence, the basic element is what is to be strived for1893 or to be realized by those with the mahayana disposition who wish to attain the results that are the three jewels. Consequently, the point of what is to be realized—the basic element—is explained first of all.You may wonder, “W ho is it that realizes this basic element as it is?” It is not even1894 realized by bodhisattvas who dwell on the ten bhumis in a part of purity, [but] it is realized by the awakening [of a buddha]. Therefore, after that, the point of realization—awakening—is explained."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"496 TranslationsYou may think, “This awakening should then be [much more] expansive [than states] without qualities (such as [the state] of an ordinary being) or [states] with small qualities (such as [the states of] sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas).” [Indeed, awakening] is endowed with qualities [as vast as] the extent of the ocean, but, in brief, it is endowed with sixty-four qualities. Consequently, thereafter, the point of the branches of this [awakening] — the qualities—is explained.“W hat do these qualities do?” Through performing the thirty-two-fold enlightened activity that accords with those qualities, they give rise to real­ization in the mind streams of others. Therefore, next, the point of giving rise to realization in others—enlightened activity—is explained. “Through what does one know such?” Maitreya himself explains this well:Because of what is to be realized, realization,Its branches, and what causes realization,In due order, one point is the cause for purity And three are the conditions.1895[2.1.1.1.1.1.4. Eliminating the flaw of m utual repetition am ong them] Now, as for eliminating the flaw of mutual repetition among [these vajra points] through connecting them in terms of the causes and results in de­pendence on the mind stream of a single person, or, as for thinking that [this order of causes and results] is mistaken, it may be asked, “W hat is the difference between the Buddha and awakening? Since the dharma rep­resents the buddha qualities, what is the difference between them? Also, what is the difference between the samgha and enlightened activity?” If one connects [the vajra points in terms of the causes and results] in dependence on [all] persons in the three times, [the above points] are without difference. However, through connecting [them] in terms of the causes and results with regard to a single person who has the mahayana disposition, there is no flaw of repetition. {429} “How is there no [such flaw]?” In dependence on just [such a single] person, the basic element that exists in his or her own m ind stream is definite as nothing but a cause1896—there is no occasion for it to be presented as a condition or a result. The means to purify this basic element that exists in [that person s] own mind stream consist of the awak­ening, the qualities, and the enlightened activity that have already arisen in the mind stream of another. Therefore, in dependence on [that person s] own mind stream, these three are definite as nothing but conditions—there is no occasion for them to be presented as a cause or a result. By virtue of"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 497having purified [that person’s] own basic element through these three func­tioning as the conditions, the basic element becomes pure. Through that, at one time on the buddhabhumi, [that person] will attain the three jewels by himself or herself. In dependence on [that person’s] own mind stream, these three are definite as nothing but the results—there is no occasion for them to be presented as a cause or a condition.In dependence on [all] persons in the three times, the triad of awak­ening, [qualities,] and enlightened activity is also the result of a buddha himself, the three jewels also become the conditions for the basic element of other subsequent persons’ becoming pure, and there is no difference in essence between a buddha and awakening either.2.1.1.1.1.2. The meaning of the latter half of verse [1.1]This has four parts:1. The essence of the presentation of the body [of the text]2. Its division3. The reason for applying the term [“body”]4. The point of the purpose of placing the presentation of the body at the outset2.1.1.1.1.2.1. The essence [of the presentation of the body of the text]If summarized, the body of the entire treatise Consists of these seven vajra points. I.ledIn brief form, this teaches the pair of what is to be expressed and the means to express it from the beginning to the end [of the text]. “How does one know such?” In the commentary on this, one finds:In brief, these seven vajra points should be known as the “body” of the entire treatise, in the form of the [seven] summary topics that are the gateways to [what this treatise] teaches.1897The summarized teaching is the summary of what is to be expressed, while the summarized gateways are the summary of the means to express it.[2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Its division]If divided, [the body of the treatise] is twofold: the body in terms of the division of terms and the body in terms of the division of meanings. The"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"498 Translationsfirst one is the summary of the means of expression, and the latter is the summary of what is to be expressed. It is explained that the body in terms of the division of the lesser supreme dharm a1898 is twofold—“terms and meanings.”2.1.1.1.1.2.3. The reason for applying the term [“body”]You may wonder, “Why is it called ‘body’?” It is the body [of the text] because it resembles a body. For example, this support that is the physi­cal body1899 functions as the support of all inner and outer ayatanas. Like­wise, this presentation of the body [of the text] functions as the support of the entire detailed explanation of the branches below. “How does one know such?” It is explained like that in the M adhyantavibhagatika.1900 From one point of view, in the sense of being pervasive, the body—this physical body that is the support—pervades everything such as the major and mi­nor limbs, fingers and toes, forehead,1901 and thumbs. Likewise, this pre­sentation of the body also pervades the entire detailed explanation of the branches below. {430}2.1.1.1.1.2.4. The purpose [of placing the presentation of the body at the outset]The purpose is that the disciples will easily understand the meaning of the detailed explanation of the branches, just like a horse that is shown familiar turf runs in an unhindered manner. This is what is to be described as the presentation of the body: it means that, through teaching them briefly as just a rough outline, the seven vajra points are easy to understand in the de­tailed explanation of the branches. “How does one know this?” The Madh- yantavibhagatika explains:It may be said, “Through understanding the treatise, will one not un­derstand its body? Therefore, it is pointless to present this [body] at the beginning.” It is not pointless because it benefits the disciples. If the disciples understand the meaning [of the body], they will also easily understand the detailed discussion, just like a horse that is shown fa­miliar turf runs in an unhindered manner.1902This completes the explanation of the meaning of the root text [of Ut- taratantra 1.1].Having explained the meaning of the root text in that way, it is matched [with the scriptures] in the following way. It may be said, “Now, there is"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 499an explanation of the seven vajra points in the tantras of secret mantra, [but] there is no explanation in the paramita sutras. Therefore, isn’t this a fabrication or presumptuous with regard to the scriptures?” Since it is possible for such wrong ideas to arise, in order to put an end to them, the author of the root text matches [the vajra points] with the scriptures, saying that the results that are the three jewels are explained in the introduction of the Dhdramsvararajasutra and that the four that are the cause and its conditions are explained in the actual sutra following the introduction. For the sake of [matching the vajra points with the sutras], he pronounces verse [1.2, which starts with] “In accordance with their specific characteristics.. The actual text of this [verse] is explained below [in detail], but its [essen­tial] meaning is [already] laid out here.2.1.1.1.2. The meaning of the com m entary This has two parts:1.

The reason for applying the term “seven vajra points” (the hermeneutical etymology)This has three parts:1. [Brief] introduction2. [Detailed] explanation3. [Concluding] summary"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"500 Translations2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Brief introductionIt is said that the Brahman Sajjana explains this [brief introduction] in due order as follows:This is twofold: the brief introduction of establishing what is to be ex­pressed as a vajra and the brief introduction of establishing the means of expression as letters. The actuality of realization is a footing that is like a vajra.And:Since it is a basis, it is a vajra point.Since this is [also] what is found as the two points of the detailed explana­tion and the conclusion, it is the heart intention of the commentary. {431} Guru Parahita explains it thus:This sevenfold actuality is beyond being an object of [ordinary states of] mind and beyond being an object of terms. Since it is to be real­ized by the nonconceptual wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas in the manner of being personally experienced, the actuality of realization is a vajra point.You may wonder, “Why are these seven called Vajras?” They are re­ferred to as “vajra-like points,” that is, they have the purport of “vajra” be­cause they resemble the vajra that is a conditioned substance. For example, a substantial vajra is difficult to penetrate by wood, clods of earth, and so on. Likewise, since these seven vajra points are difficult to realize through the prajnas of studying, reflecting, and meditating of [everybody] from or­dinary beings up through ¿ravakas and pratyekabuddhas, they are called “vajras.” “And why are these seven referred to as Vajra points?” It is said [that they are so called] because they are bases. They are footings because1904 they are the focal objects or bases to be realized by the personally experi­enced wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.

Detailed explanation of establishing the letters (the means of ex­pressing [them]) as footings2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Detailed explanation of establishing the seven [actuali­ties] to be expressed as vajrasThis is explained as follows. The seven actualities [of the Uttaratantra] are to be understood as being like the vajra that is a conditioned substance. “What kind of actualities are these actualities?” They are actualities that are eminent by virtue of three distinctive features. [R G W ’s phrase] “because it is difficult to penetrate by any cognitions1905 that arise from studying and reflecting” teaches that they are beyond being objects of the minds of sra- vakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary beings. This also includes not being an object of [their] prajna that arises from meditation. [The phrase] “inex­pressible nature” teaches that they are beyond being objects of terms. You may wonder, “Well, the objects of what are they then?” [The phrase]1906 “which is to be realized through personally experienced [wisdom]” teaches that they are the objects of the nonconceptual wisdom of buddhas. Now [follows:]2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2. The detailed explanation of establishing the letters (the means of expressing [them]) as footingsThis has two parts:1. The actual [explanation]2. Elimination of disputational flaws2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.1. The actual [explanation]This is expressed [by the phrase] “The words that express this actuality. . . are [also] called Tooting.’” “Why?” Because they serve as the supports that teach or elucidate these seven actualities. Now [follows:]2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2.2. Elimination of disputational flawsIt may be said, “Well, having explained above that these seven actualities are inexpressible through terms, it is stated here what the letters are that express those actualities. Therefore, [what is said] earlier and later is con­tradictory.” There is no such flaw. There is contradiction if two contradic­tory attributes come together in a single bearer of attributes, but here [the text] has different bearers of attributes in mind. “How is that?” Above, it is said {432} in accordance with the realization of buddhas and bodhisattvas in terms of ultimate reality that the specifically characterized actualities [of"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"502 Translationsthe vajra points] are inexpressible. Here, in accordance with the appear­ances of ordinary beings who see just this life in terms of seeming reality, the seven actualities are what teach the path in accordance with subsequent attainment1907 by way of letters such as “This is the Buddha.” Therefore, there is no contradiction.Here, through first studying, reflecting in the middle, and finally medi­tating, there arise the direct realizations of the seven vajra points that rep­resent the supreme familiarization (the ninth bhümi), the final supreme [familiarization] (the tenth bhümi), and the yogic cognition that arises from this final [familiarization]—the wisdom of a buddha. For example, this is just as the actualities of impermanence, suffering, and so on, are inexpressible by words and [yet] are expressed through letters such as “im­permanence,” “suffering,” and “empty.”2.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.

The com m entary’s explanation by matching their being established as vajra points with the scriptures because they are difficult to realizeYou may wonder, “Is there an explanation from the scriptures that presents the seven vajra points as vajras—isn’t it just arbitrary?” As for “vajra,” since the seven actualities are difficult to realize, they are explained as “vajras.” [Likewise,] since they are difficult to realize, they are explained from the scriptures. It is in that way that the commentary matches them with the scriptures in the manner of supporting the root text. This has two parts:1. Matching [the fact that] the results that are the three jewels are established as vajra points through the scriptures because they are difficult to realize2. Matching [the fact that] the four that are the cause and its conditions are established as vajra points1911 through the scriptures because they are difficult to realize2.1.1.1.2.1.3.L M atching [the fact that] the results that are the three jewels are established as vajra points through the scriptures because they are difficult to realize{433} The Sthirádhydsayaparivartasütram2 says:“Ánanda, to those bhiksus who engage in yoga and wish to directly perceive arhathood, teach the dharma such that desire, hatred, and dullness are not to be relinquished.1913 Teach the dharma such that the Tathágata is indemonstrable, the dharma is inaudible, and the samgha cannot be worshipped. . . Then, venerable Ánanda said to the Tathágata, “Bhagavan, how is the Tathágata indemonstrable? How is the dharma inaudible? How can the samgha not be worshipped?” The Tathágata said.. .”1914The three sentences [from this sütra that are quoted in R G W ] appear right after this [passage].1915 [Thus,] the three essences of the three jewels are"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"504 Translationsmatched [with the scriptures] here in the same way as they are explained in the section on identifying the essences of the seven vajra points [in R G W ].As for the reason for establishing the Buddha as a vajra point because he is difficult to realize, you may wonder, “How does [the phrase] ‘He can­not be seen with the eyes exist as a scriptural passage that establishes [the Buddha] as a vajra point?” The eye is the support, which illustrates what is supported by it—the eye consciousness. If the Buddha is not realized by nonconceptual cognitions ([such as] the eye consciousness), he is even less realized by conceptual cognitions (the prajnas of the triad of studying, reflecting, and meditating of ¿ravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary be­ings). Thus, it is established that [the Buddha] is a vajra point because he is difficult to realize. It may be said, “However, all [levels] up through the buddhabhumi are again realized through the conceptual prajnas of study­ing and reflecting, but they are not realized by nonconceptual [cognitions]. Therefore, does this not become a contradictory reason?” It is flawless. Conceptual cognitions take1916 the seeming [reality] of object generalities as their objects [but] are not able to take specifically characterized referents as their objects, whereas the consciousnesses of the five [sense] gates take specifically characterized referents as their objects. Here, it is established that the specifically characterized phenomenon that is the Buddha is diffi­cult to realize. Object generalities are realized by the cognitions of ordinary beings. Therefore, if the specifically characterized referent that is the Bud­dha is realized, it is allotted to being realized by a nonconceptual cognition, but if it is not realized by that, how could it be realized by a conceptual cognition? It is not realized [by such]. This is the gist of this explanation.As for establishing the dharma as a vajra point because it is difficult to realize, it is correlated to [the phrase “It cannot be heard with the ears”] in the same way [as above] by exchanging the subject “eye consciousness” with “ear consciousness.”With regard to the samgha, [the phrase] “because it is unconditioned” refers to not being conditioned by karma and afflictions. As for [the sutra’s phrase] “it cannot be worshipped with body or mind,” it cannot be wor­shipped with the body—bodhisattvas on the ten bhumis simply consist of [the kind of] flesh and blood that do not perish because they are not con­ditioned by karma and afflictions. Rather, {434} since they are presented as having the essence of the wisdoms of knowing suchness and variety, one cannot do things such as give them a massage. As for the mind, through reflecting on the meaning [of this term] here, m ind refers to the conscious­nesses of the five [sense] gates, [that is,] their being nonconceptual. Since"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 505they are nonconceptual cognitions, they are correlated [here] as in the above [explanations of] how [the phrases “He cannot be seen with the eyes” and “It cannot be heard with the ears”] become scriptural passages that es­tablish [the Buddha and the dharma] as vajra points. Now [follows:]2.1.1.1.2.1.3.2. Matching [the fact that] the four that are the cause and its conditions are established as vajra points through the scriptures [be­cause they are difficult to realize]This has four parts:2.1.1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Establishing the basic element as a vajra point because it is difficult to realizeThis is established [through] the Anunatvapurnatvasutra,1917 Since “actual­ity” in this [quote] is what is to be realized, this actuality is a general term for all seven [vajra points]. Through correlating the meaning of this general term with its particular instance by virtue of the context, it [here] refers to the basic element. For example, this is like [the phrase] “Bring what is beyond the earth” referring to salt when spoken by the kings cook but re­ferring to a horse when spoken by the kings general. As for the phrase “[this actuality] cannot be [correctly] known, seen, or discriminated [even by sra­vakas and pratyekabuddhas],” in due order, Ngog [Lotsawa] matches the triad [of “known,” “seen,” and “discriminated”] with the triad of the path of preparation, the path of seeing, and the path of familiarization, and also with the triad of preparation, main phase, and conclusion.1918 However, this is not the case. Rather, in due order, [these three] are matched with the pra- jnas of studying, reflecting, and meditating. “How does one know such?” Because [RG W ] explained above that “[this actuality] is difficult to pene­trate by any cognitions that arise from studying and reflecting.”You may wonder, “Why are there three names in the sutra for the sin­gle actuality that is the basic element?”1919 Because [Uttaratantra 1.48 and R G W on it] teach that this basic element is labeled with three names during its phase of being impure (ordinary beings), its phase of being both pure and impure (the ten bhumis), and its phase of being completely pure (buddhahood). In due order, these are correlated to the [three] statements [that start with] “Sariputra, ‘the ultimate . . .” You may wonder, “At the time of the sutra, how does this become1920 a scriptural passage that estab­lishes the basic element as a vajra point because it is difficult to realize?” This is clearly explained [by R G W s saying] that it cannot be realized by"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"506 Translationsthe three prajñás of šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas, let alone by ordinary naive beings.[2.1.1.1.2.1.3.2.2.

The three conditions such as awakening are taught in the section on the eightyfold"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"508 Translationsdistinction [of teaching the attributes] of the victor, which consists of the sixteen [kinds of the] great compassion of great awakening and so on. [All] these will be explained in detail below.1927Among the words of the sütra on the three jewels, “the Bhagavàn” refers to the one who is endowed with overcoming the four mâras or is endowed with the six qualities such as sovereignty.1928 As for “all phenomena,” since they bear their own specific characteristics, these phenomena comprise [all] conditioned and unconditioned phenomena. “Equality” refers to the equal nature of phenomena, which teaches lack of attachment. “Completely and perfectly awakened” refers to direct enlightened realization, which teaches lack of obstruction. As for “has excellently turned the wheel of dharma,” you may wonder, “W hy is this referred to as ‘wheel’?” It is the wheel of dharma that is endowed with the eightfold path of the noble ones. There­fore, it is a wheel because it resembles a wheel. For example, a wheel {436} has three attributes. W hat resembles the hub that brings [the spokes] to­gether is samàdhi. W hat resembles the rim that prevents [the wheel] from splitting asunder is firmness. W hat resembles the spokes that cut through is the correct view. Or, just as a wheel makes those who have not arrived at a battle arrive [there], this [wheel of dharma] makes those who have not realized the [true] actuality realize it. Or, it is similar to the wheel of a char­iot—just as that [wheel] functions as the support for progressing further and further, this [wheel of dharma] functions as the support for all qualities progressing further and further. In [the phrase] “endowed with limitless very disciplined assemblies of disciples,” “disciplined” [means that] those with the three dispositions possess the capacity to attain their individual three [kinds of] awakening. “Being endowed” [means] being surrounded.As for “the remaining four points,” it was [already] explained that they are taught in the main part of the sütra following the introduction.1929 It is said that some scholars are mistaken [in claiming] that without the in­tention of implying the main part of the sütra, the mere essence of the seven vajra points without being specified by their specific characteristics is taught for all seven in the sütra [passages] of the introduction itself. [The phrase] “the causes that correspond to the arising of the three jewels” [re­fers to] the substantial cause, that is, the basic element. “Accomplishing” [indicates] the means for purifying the basic element from adventitious stains, that is, the three conditions [that are awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity]."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 5092.1.1.2.2.2.

Detailed explanation of the results that are the three jewels This has three parts:1. The qualities of the consummate causes of the three jewels2. The infinite qualities [of the three jewels]3. The unsurpassable qualities [of the three jewels]The first one refers to [the three jewels] being attained in dependence on [their respective] primary causes that make one attain them. The second one refers to the infinite enumeration of their qualities. The third one refers to their ultimate qualities. [In RGW ,] there is only the explanation of the [three] basic phrases in the introduction of all three1930 [jewels in the Dharanisvararajasutra]: “The Bhagavàn has completely and perfectly awakened to the equality of all phenomena.”2.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. The qualities of the consummate causes [of the three jewels][According to the Dharanisvararajasutra,] this means the following. W hen [the Buddha] dwelled on the eighth bhümi, through nonconceptual wis­doms engaging the dharmadhâtu on its own accord (the primary cause of attaining the jewel of the Buddha), he attained mastery over relinquishing contaminated conditioned phenomena and [also] attained mastery over perceiving uncontaminated unconditioned phenomena, thus attaining mastery over all phenomena. Therefore, based on this most fundamental of [all] causes [for becoming a buddha], the jewel of the complete and per­fect buddhahood [of realizing] all phenomena as equality is attained at the time of the fruition.After the cause of the Buddha has been explained by this, {437} now the cause of the dharma is explained. It is said that when [the Buddha] dwelled on the ninth bhümi, he attained the wisdom of the four [kinds of] discriminating awareness and thereby explained the dharma of the mahâyâna. Therefore, based on this most fundamental of [all] causes [for completely realizing and teaching the dharma] (being endowed with [the"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"5io Translationspower of] proclaiming the unsurpassable dharma and so on), the jewel [of the dharma] is attained at the time of the fruition.As for the explanation of the cause of the samgha, it is said [in the Dhdranisvararajasutra] that on the tenth bhumi, the light rays [called] “Fearless Self-Confidence” from the crown of the head of the Buddha cir­cled the entire assembly of the retinue seven times, circled [bodhisattvas like] the bodhisattva Dharanlivararaja one hundred times, and then be­came absorbed into the crown of their heads. Through this, [a bodhisat­tva] like Dharanlivararaja received the empowerment as the unsurpassable dharma regent of the Tathagata.1931 Immediately upon that, based on this causal seed that makes the deeds of a buddha effortless and uninterrupted, [the jewel of] the samgha was obtained at the time of the fruition. You may think, “Explain these limitless disciplined assemblies of disciples.” Since this is explained by having in mind that it is difficult, [the Dhdranisvara- rajasutra] says, “the limitless very disciplined assemblies of disciples . . .” Now [follows:]2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2. The explanation of the infinite qualities [of the three jewels]This has three parts:2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1. The infinite qualities of the Buddha[This consists of R G W s passage] “Then, immediately after the discussion of the praiseworthy qualities...” As for “the discussion of the praiseworthy qualities of sravakas and bodhisattvas,” [the passage] in the introduction of the [Dhdranisvarardjajsutra [starting] with “resided together with a great bhiksu samgha of sixty thousand bhiksus, all of whom were all-knowing” and ending in “had solely entered the word of the Buddha”1932 teaches fif­teen qualities of Sravakas. Then, [the passage starting] with “together with an immeasurable samgha of bodhisattvas, that is, together with bodhisat­tva mahasattvas who are delivered through their sphere of omniscience without attachment” and ending in “who are exclusively endowed with all qualities through their uninterrupted bodhisattva conduct for hundreds of thousands of eons that are immeasurable, infinite, and endless”1933 explains fourteen qualities [of bodhisattvas]. Thereafter, [the sutra] explains, “It is as follows: together with the bodhisattva mahasattva *Samantavabhasana- varanaloka ...,” which represents the enumeration of the names of eight bodhisattvas, [ending in] “and other innumerable and immeasurable bodhi­sattvas.”1934 Through these very1935 [passages in the sutra s introduction], the"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 511above words of the sütra that explain the particular distinction of the qual­ities of the samgha1936 are also to be understood. {438}[R G W s phrase] “which is based on the inconceivable supreme samádhi of the Buddha” [corresponds to the following passage in the sütra:] “W hen sixteen years had passed after the Bhagavan had become a buddha, he knew that pure conduct had been flourishing, also saw and knew the great assem­bly of bodhisattvas, and knew, ‘How amazing, these assemblies of bodhi­sattvas are the ones who seize the treasure of the dharma of the Tathágata.' Then, he thought, ‘I will vastly take care of these bodhisattvas as follows. In order to introduce these bodhisattva mahásattvas to the object of the Tathágata, through the Tathágata's great emanations and the Tathágata's great miraculous displays, I shall teach them the dharma specification called “the door to unobscured final deliverance through entering the con­duct of a bodhisattva.”'”1937 If this very [teaching] is given a name due to the one who requested it, it is [called] the Dhüranisvararájasütra.Now, in order to build a mansion for explaining this sütra, on Vulture Flock Mountain,1938 [the sütra says that] “the Bhagaván rested in meditative equipoise in the samádhi of a tathágata called ‘Displaying the Emanation of the Object1939 of a Buddha Just as It Is.'”1940 This samádhi is inconceivable because it is inconceivable for the minds of ordinary beings, šrávakas, and pratyekabuddhas. [Also,] this samádhi is a bull because it resembles a bull. For example, it is said, “Among cattle, this is the bull.” Likewise, among the many samádhis that the Buddha has, this one alone is supreme and there­fore is [like] a bull [among them].Through the blessings of the Bhagaván's resting in meditative equipoise in that samádhi on Vulture Flock Mountain, now a vast garden made of jewels was established [in the space] above the desire realm gods who have power over others' emanations and below the form gods of Brahmaká- yika.1941 This has two parts: (1) through which particular causes it was es­tablished and (2) for what purpose it was established. (1) The causes are twofold: (a) the direct cause and (b) the indirect cause. The direct cause is represented by [the phrase] “made of jewels,” that is, the cause that is the ground whose shape is that of white beryl, golden houses, arched door­ways [made of] swords, gate houses [made of] precious diamond stones, and ledges [by the gateways] made of the precious stones [called] “stainless light.” The indirect cause is represented by [the phrase] “being established by the roots of virtue of the Tathágata.” (2) The purpose is “to purify the thinking of bodhisattvas, illuminate the worldly realms of the ten direc­tions, satisfy the thinking of limitless sentient beings, {439} outshine all"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"512 Translationsthe palaces of the gods, and exhort all bodhisattvas of the ten directions to listen to this sütra.”Inside this garden, on the periphery, there arose many billions of lion thrones on which bodhisattvas resided, which were countless, had many varieties, were beautiful to behold, high, very excellent, broad, vast, pleas­ing to the mind, and delighting to the mind. Then, [there was] a staircase to ascend to it, surrounded by a circumference the size of seven humans, its width being half a yojanà,1942 made of sapphires,1943 and adorned by all kinds of jewels. Through the movements of a web of small bells [made] of jewels, there arose a [lovely] chime. From each of the four continents, four thousand [continents] arose. Then, [such a staircase] arose in [all] four-continent [worlds] of all the chiliocosms of a trichiliocosm. Then, the Bhagavàn arose from that samâdhi, shook the greatest chiliocosm in this trichiliocosm [six times], and a great light arose too. Then, the Bhaga- vân ascended the staircase and went to that garden [by gradually passing through the six realms of the desire gods].He had two retinues: (1) the retinue that dwelled together with [the Buddha] and (2) the retinue that arrived suddenly. (1) The first one is the one that had gone to Vulture Flock M ountain1944 as the physical location: [the Buddha] was surrounded by an assembly of bodhisattvas, an assem­bly of éràvakas was before him, and gods and nâgas offered praises, show­ered down a great rain of flowers, covered [everything] with a great rain of garments, scattered a great rain of [aromatic] powders, incense, and ointments, had the great [sounds of] cymbals and melodies resound, shook the great worldly realm, and illuminated countless worldly realms. [At that point,] the great power of the Buddha and the great miraculous display of the Buddha illuminated only Vulture Flock Mountain. Many billions of great gods, nâgas, yaksas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, and ura- gas followed as attendants,1945 ascended the staircase [made] of all kinds of precious gems, and went to that vast garden. [All] these represent the reti­nue that dwelled together with [the Buddha]. (2) Now, the retinue that ar­rived suddenly is explained. [The sütra says that] then, once the Bhagavàn and his retinue [on their way up the staircase] had arrived at the location of the gods who belong to the Four Kinds of Great Kings, the gods who belong to the Four Kinds of Great Bangs knew that the Bhagavàn with his retinue had come to their location, and thus the assemblies of the gods who belong to the Four Kinds of Great Kings approached the Bhagavàn. On this, the commentary [R G W merely says], “the gathering of the retinues of the Tathàgata.” {440} In order to perform activities of venerating the Bhagavàn,"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 513they showered down clouds of flowers [made] of divine substances as pres­ents. On this, [RG W ] says, “their arranging various kinds of offerings of divine substances.” [In this way,] the gods who belong to the Four Kinds of Great Kings [praised] 1946 the Bhagavan. The fire of the sun and the moon, the shine of jewels, and the very stainless divine light of those in the land of gods were all outshone by the light of the sage, and thus he pacified even all three lower realms. Through [his light] falling onto M ount M eru and the peaks of its surrounding [mountain] enclosure, the realms were illuminated. Having been pleased and delighted through that, [these gods] praised the victor who fulfills all goals, [saying,] “We take refuge [in you],” and followed the arrived Bhagavan as attendants. This [is represented by R G W s phrase] “their showering down clouds of praises.”In the sútra, the same is found in detail for the remaining five classes of gods [of the desire realm].1947 To summarize, the remaining five classes of gods knew that the Bhagavan with his retinue had come to their location and thus approached the Bhagavan. On [all] this, [R G W merely] says, “the gathering of the retinues of the Tathágata.” In order to perform activities of venerating the Bhagavan, the gods of the Thirty-Three showered down clouds of incense [made] of divine substances as presents. The gods of Free from Combat showered down clouds of garments [made] of divine substances. The gods of Tusita showered down clouds of jewels1948 [made] of divine substances. The gods of Enjoying Emanations showered down clouds of ornaments [made] of divine substances. The gods of Power over Others' Emanations showered down clouds of pearl necklaces [made] of divine substances. On [all] this, [RGVV] says, “their arranging various kinds of offerings of divine substances.” Each one [of these classes of gods also] uttered verses of praise to the Bhagaván, on which [R G W ] says, “their showering down clouds of praises.”Then, the Bhagaván with this retinue reached that garden and sat on the lion throne as it had been arranged.1949 Then, after having gathered ev­eryone within the six classes of gods of the desire realm as his retinue, he saw that the retinue was too small for explaining this sútra and thought about gathering [a larger] retinue, thus resting in meditative equipoise in the buddha samádhi “[The Buddha's] playing in unobscured liberation.”1950 Immediately upon resting in meditative equipoise in that samádhi, light rays equal [in number] to the sand grains in the river Gaňgá came forth from the pores of the Buddha and, upon having come forth, illuminated all ten directions. Upon having illuminated [all] worldly realms, through the touch of each light ray, all sufferings of the lower realms were discontinued"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"514 Translationsand all stirring of the afflictions of all sentient beings was pacified. Then, in order to exhort all bodhisattvas in the ten directions to listen to this sutra, {441} four verses appeared at the tips of those light rays, [ending with the following verse]:It is what has not been turned, is unequaled, and is turned by all victors—This genuine wheel [of dharma] with ten powers I turn today out of loving-kindness for sentient beings.[This turning] that is praised by living beings, difficult to find, excellent, and vast will happen today.Those with very vast and open devotion and striving, look [at it] today![Thereafter, the light rays] returned and melted into the crown of the head of the Bhagavan. Then, those light rays pervaded the east, and in the eastern buddha realm *Lokadhatugunanantaratnapunyavyuhavistara- vatl1951 of the Tathagata *Vimalavi£uddharatnaprabhabodhyangavadanu- cchedadharmaraimivyuharaja,1952 the bodhisattva called Puspafrlgarbha- sarvadharmavaSavartin1953 was exhorted by those light rays. Immediately upon that, bodhisattvas ten times the num ber of sand grains in the river Ganga surrounded him and dwelled in front [of him]. All together, they disappeared from that buddha realm and arrived in Saha, this worldly realm [of ours], in just a single instant. Having arrived in this garden, they sat down on seats that they created through their individual miraculous powers. [All] this is represented by [R G W ’s phrase] “the gathering of the retinues of the Tathagata.” In order to perform activities of venerating the Buddha, they showered down a web of divine beryls as presents. On this, [R G W ] says, “their arranging various kinds of offerings of divine substances.” Then, they praised [the Buddha] with [verses] such as:Bhagavan, completely without equal and the perfection of qualities,The garlands of the praises of your qualities are uttered in all ten directions.The host of qualities that you own is a treasury of qualities that fills [all] realms.We who strive for the dharma have come here.On this, [RGW' says], “their showering down clouds of praises.”Then, through those light rays pervading the south, in the buddha realm *Lokadhatupratibhana of the Tathagata *Gunanantaratnapratibhana, the"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 515bodhisattva called Ratnayasti was exhorted by those light rays. In further detail, the same as [described] above applies. After having covered the Bud­dha with a web of gold as a present, [the bodhisattva] praised him with two verses.Then, through those light rays’ pervading the west, in the buddha realm *LokadhàtvavabhàsavatI of the Tathagata *Samantâvabhâsa, the bodhisat­tva *Ravanabalaràja was exhorted by those light rays, covered the Buddha with a web of necklaces [made] of gems and pearls as a present, and praised him with two verses. {442}Then, through that light’s pervading the north, in the buddha realm *Lo- kadhàtusarvaratnaracanà of the Tathagata *Gunànantaratnapratibhàna,1954 the bodhisattva *Agramatisagara was exhorted by those light rays, covered the Buddha with necklaces [made] of gems and webs [made] of jewels as presents, and praised him with two verses. Just as before, these three [pas­sages] also correspond to [R G W s passage] “the gathering of the retinues of the Tathagata, their arranging various kinds of offerings of divine sub­stances, and their showering down clouds of praises.”Likewise, the [same] three [activities] are explained in the sütra for each [of the instances of those light rays’ traveling] to the four intermediate [di­rections] as well as above and below. At the end, through pervading the ze­nith, in the buddha realm *Lokadhàtvalamkàrabhüsità1955 of the Tathagata *Ravanotkrstabalaraja, the bodhisattva *Sarvadharmavikurvanaràja was exhorted by those light rays. Immediately upon that, bodhisattvas ten times the number of sand grains in the river Gaügâ surrounded him and dwelled in front [of him ]. They disappeared from that buddha realm1956 and arrived in Sahá, this worldly realm [of ours], in just a single instant. In this garden, they sat down on seats that they created through their individual miracu­lous powers. On this, [R G W says,] “the gathering of the retinues of the Tathagata.” In order to perform activities of venerating the Bhagavàn, they covered the Buddha with a web of small bells [made] of jewels as a present. On this, [RG W ] says, “their arranging various kinds of offerings of divine substances.” Then, they praised [the Buddha] with two verses [beginning with]:The enlightened activity of the bodies of the sugatas without middle and endAnd the infinite sphere of speech and m ind of the unsurpassable ones Is known by the buddhas but not by other sentient beings,Just as in the example of people not finding the end of space."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"5i6 TranslationsThis represents [RGVV s phrase] “their showering down clouds of praises.”Then, the Bhagavan arose from his samádhi and made a sound of clear­ing his throat.1957 This was heard in all chiliocosms of this trichiliocosm1958 as a melody, and [all] bhiksus, upásakas, upásikás, and nonhumans with devotion ascended that staircase and came to that garden. They paid hom ­age to the Bhagaván and then sat down on seats in accordance with [their status]. Through the sound of [the Buddhas] clearing his throat, all gods [of the form realm] from Brahmakáyika up through Akanistha came to that garden, paid homage to the Bhagaván, and sat down on their individ­ual firm seats. {443} These [passages also correspond to R G W s phrase] “the gathering of the retinues of the Tathágata.” Now, what is to be ex­plained is [the following:]2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.2. The infinite qualities of the dharma[In RGVV, the description of these qualities begins with the phrase] “Follow­ing that,... the splendid arrangement of the dharma throne...” [According to the sutra,]1959 then, wishing to utter this sutra, the Bhagaván thought of making1960 the bodhisattva Puspasrlgarbha1961 build a lion throne and thus emitted the light rays called “Demonstrating the Power of Bodhisattvas” from the úrná hair between his eyebrows. These light rays circled the entire assembly of the retinue seven times and then became absorbed into the as­sembly of bodhisattvas. Then, immediately upon those light rays touching the bodhisattva Puspasrlgarbha, Puspasrlgarbha rested in meditative equi­poise in the bodhisattva samádhi “Array of Ornaments.” Through this, in the middle of the garden arrayed with jewels, there arose [a seat for the Buddha—] a lion throne the height of eight hundred quintillions the size of a palm tree, adorned with all [kinds of] jewels, its circumference being made from all [kinds of] ornaments, spread with all [kinds of] arrays of cloths, strewn1962 with all [kinds of] flower petals, adorned1963 with all [kinds of] pleasing canopies, and satisfying the thinking of all sentient beings. Then, after Puspasrlgarbha had risen from that samádhi, he thought of requesting the Bhagaván to sit on that seat. Thus, with respect and honorific language, he folded his palms and requested this through eight verses [ending in]:For the sake of serving and paying respect to you and listening to the dharma,These pure sentient beings have arrived from the ten directions.Please clarify the topic for whose sake they have arrived.Please reside on this lion throne and also explain the dharma."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 517Then, knowing the superior intention of Puspairigarbha, [the Buddha] sat on the lion throne. [R G W ’s phrase] “light [emerging from the Buddha’s forehead]” refers to the Buddha’s emitting the light rays [called] “Demonstrating the Power of Bodhisattvas” for the sake of making [Puspasrlgarbha] build this throne. It is said that guru Parahita stated:After having sat down on the lion throne, the Bhagavan emitted all kinds of light rays in order to guide those to be guided.[The following corresponds to R G W ’s phrase] “the proclamation of the names and the qualities of [various] specifications of the dharma.” Then, after the Bhagavan had found unobscured liberation, he explained a twen­ty-two-fold enumeration of names such as “the dharma specification ‘the door to unobscured final deliverance through entering the conduct of a bodhisattva,’ which focuses on establishing [disciples] on the bodhisattva path.” Since these {444} represent the qualities of the dharma, [they corre­spond to R G W ’s phrase] “the proclamation of the qualities.” It is said that Parahita declared:From the dharma of explanation (the twelve branches of the Buddha’s speech), the dharma of accomplishment (the eightfold path of the noble ones) and the ultimate dharma (nirvana) arise. The latter arises from this [dharma of accomplishment] and the former [dharma of explanation].Now [follows:]2.1.1.2.2.2.1.2.3. The explanation of the infinite qualities of the samgha [In R G W , the description of these qualities begins with the phrase] “Right after that... the mutual display of the powers of the spheres . . . of the samadhis of bodhisattvas . . .”1964 The meaning of that is this: [According to the sutra,] then, the Bhagavan and his retinue sat on their seats and there displayed the power of samadhi until [the Buddha] spoke the dharma.

Likewise, all other [bodhisattvas] (such as the bodhi­sattvas in the four intermediate directions, above, and below) each dem on­strated various powers of samâdhi.[The following corresponds to RGVVs phrase] “the description of praising their various qualities.” [According to the sütra,] then, the Bhaga­vàn graced the assembly of the retinue by saying, “This is good,” and the bodhisattva Dharmeévararàja1967 knew that the time for explaining the dharma had come. Thus, he described the qualities of bodhisattvas, saying, “Bhagavan, how amazing, these assemblies of bodhisattvas are great.1968 These assemblies of bodhisattvas don the inconceivable armor.

Thinking, “I have received empow­erment through the light rays of the Buddha,” he rose from his seat, threw his robes over one shoulder, placed his right kneecap on the ground, folded his palms, [and bowed]. In the space right above the crown of the head of the Buddha, [Dharanlsvararaja] opened an umbrella [made] of jewels, named “Ornament of the Tathagata.” Its handle was made of beryl; its cov­ering, of gold; its top ornament, of a kimsuka jewel;1976 and its spokes, of sapphires.

You may wonder, “How [is that]?” The subject [of that probative argument] is “the buddha element.” It is called such be­cause it is realized by buddhas just as it is and serves as the cause for attain­ing buddhahood. The probandum is “is explained,” that is, “it is explained that this naturally pure [buddha element] exists in all sentient beings.” “Why is that?” The reason says, “because the sixty conditions for purifying the basic element are taught in the main part of the sutra following the in­troduction.” [All of] this [corresponds to R G W ’s passage] “Next, after the introductory section of the sutra .. .”1999It may be said, “If sixty conditions for purifying the basic element are taught, this contradicts teaching three conditions when ascertaining the number of the seven vajra points.” This is not contradictory—it is said that these sixty are presented as certain particular [features] of the basic element itself, [such as] “oneself engaging properly.” The teaching on the four [fac­tors] such as faith [in the mahayana dharma] during the causal phase of the basic element should also be understood in that way.It may be said, “The sixty factors for purifying the basic element are taught in the sutra, but if there is no basic element in sentient beings, why is [the above reason] not uncertain?” The answer to this question is two­fold: eliminating the flaw of [the reason’s] being uncertain by way of rea­soning and eliminating the flaw of [the reason’s] being uncertain by way of scripture.First, the certainty about the positive concomitance appears in the text [of RGVV as the phrase] “the object to be purified,” which [means] that there is a basis to be purified.2000 [The phrase] “if [the object to be puri­fied] is endowed with qualities” [means] that there also is a purpose2001 if it is purified. The latter phrase means that the explanation of the means of purification is justified. Implicitly, this [also] applies to the certainty about the negative concomitance, which means that if neither the basis to be pu­rified—the basic element—exists in sentient beings nor a purpose in purify­ing it exists, an explanation of the means of purifying it is not justified, just as in the example of [trying to purify] gold versus charcoal.The elimination of the flaw of [the reason’s] being uncertain through scripture consists of three sections from the sutras [in RGVV]. Among these three, the elimination of the flaw of [the reason’s] being uncertain [through] the Dasabhumikasutra consists of [the passage] “Taking up this"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"522 Translationsmotive. . This [initial] phrase [in that passage means] “this motive of the naturally pure basic elements existing in all sentient beings.” That scrip­tural passage represents the certainty about the positive concomitance. The certainty about the negative concomitance is established implicitly, which means that if the basic element (the basis to be purified) did not exist in all sentient beings, the explanation in the Dasabhümikasütra about the m an­ner of purifying the basic element on the ten bhümis by giving the manner of purifying fine gold as an example {448} would not be justified.The elimination of the flaw of [the reasons] being uncertain through the Dhâranïsvararâjasütra consists of [the passage] “In this sütra here ...” “This sütra here” means the Dhâranïsvararâjasütra. [The explanation] in this [sütra] consists of an example and its meaning. The example is the teaching of the threefold example of purifying the basic element in three phases. This is to be thought of as [consisting of] four points. (1) W hat pu­rifies2002 is represented by [the sütras phrase] “an expert jeweler who knows the procedure of refining gems very well.” (2) The object to be purified is represented by [the phrase] “having extracted . . . jewel mine.” (3) The means of purification is represented by [the passage] “he washes them in a caustic acidic solution ...” As for the three means of cleansing, the first one is soda, the second one is the broth from having cooked fish, and the third one is a toxic fluid because these three are caustic. It is said that the third one in the sütra is quicksilver. (4) The manner of [presenting] the purpose or the result of purification is represented by [the passage] “Thus cleansed. . . ”The meaning [of this] also has four parts. (1) The agent who purifies consists of [the phrase] “the Tathagata too.” (2) The object to be purified consists of [the phrase] “upon perceiving the impure basic element of sen­tient beings.” (3) The means of purification consist of [the phrase] “creates weariness ...” Among the three phases [of purification], the first phase2003 consists of teaching the four realities and thus making [those to be guided] attain [the fruitions of] a stream-enterer [and so on]. This refers to tem­porarily teaching nothing but seeming [reality]. During the second phase, [the basic element] is purified through the three doors to liberation. That is, subsequent to the [first phase], the dharma of the lack of characteris­tics—the two realities—is taught, which establishes [those to be guided] in the mahâyâna and then introduces them to [mahâyâna] mind training.

Identifying the essences of the attributes of the intelli­gent and the victorsThis has two parts. [First,] with [the readers] wondering what the intel- ligents own sixtyfold essence is in itself, the [corresponding] question [“What are those sixty kinds of factors of purifying the buddha element?”] is formulated in the text [of R G W ]. This [essence] consists of ones own welfare and the welfare of others. The first one is twofold: the four orna­ments2007 (the causes) and the eight illuminations (the results). The welfare of others is also twofold: the sixteen [kinds of] compassion (the causes) and the thirty-two [kinds of] activity (the results).Here, as for the four ornaments of bodhisattvas, the sütra says:Those that embellish2008 this genuine supreme yána Are the four ornaments of those with great insight—Discipline, samádhi, likewise supreme2009 prajñá,Which has the meaning of great ascertainment, and also dháranl.2010You may wonder, “W hy are these four called ‘ornam ents?” Bodhisattvas who are endowed with these four embellish their conduct [with them]."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"524 TranslationsTherefore, since they resemble ornaments [in this way], they are called “ornaments.”The eight kinds of illumination are the illuminations of (1) mindful­ness, (2) insight, (3) realization, (4) dharmas, (5) wisdom, (6) reality, (7) the supernatural knowledges, and (8) practice. “W hy are these eight called ‘illuminations?” For, through being endowed with these eight, one attains the illumination of the dharma and becomes free from the darkness of ig­norance, thus attaining the utterly lucid door of the dharma.The sixteen kinds of the great compassion of bodhisattvas are the [six­teen forms of] compassion for sentient beings who (1) possess all kinds of [wrong] views, (2) [entertain] the four mistakennesses, (3) cling to “me” and what is mine, (4) [possess] the five obscurations, (5) are attached to the objects of the six ayatanas, (6) [possess] the seven [kinds of] pride, (7) deviate from the path of the noble ones, (8) lack self-control, (9) are angry, (10) commit evil actions, (11) lack the prajna of the noble ones, (12) do not realize profound dependent origination, (13) have not relinquished the latent tendencies of [wrong] views, (14) are not free from the burden of suffering, (15) behave in deceitful and arrogant ways, and (16) deviate from the higher realms and liberation. [In this way,] “compassion for sentient beings” applies to [all sixteen], with [this compassion only] being divided byw ay of its [different] focal objects. “Why are they called compassion’?” Because they [all] represent [states of mind] that have the [cognitive] as­pect of wishing to relinquish these [sixteen forms of] mistakenness.The thirty-two activities of bodhisattvas are (1) to awaken [sentient be­ings] from the sleep of ignorance, (2) to bring those with inferior faith to vast [faith], (3) to bring those who wish for what is not the dharma to wish­ing for the dharma, {450} (4) to establish those who have impure livelihood in pure [livelihood], (5) to establish those with bad views in the correct view,(6) to establish those with improper mental engagement in proper mental engagement, (7) to establish those who abide in wrong dharmas in the right dharma, (8)-(13) to establish those who abide in the antagonistic factors of the six paramitas in the six paramitas (these six are counted separately),(14) to bring those who are not skilled in means to being skilled in means,(15) to bring those with afflictions to [the state of] lacking afflictions, (16) to bring those who have reference points to [the state of] being without refer­ence points, (17) to bring those without discipline to discipline, (18) to bring those who do not repay kindness to repaying kindness, (19) to bring those who have fallen into the four rivers to [the state of] being liberated from them, (20) to bring those who do not heed advice to heeding advice,2011 (21)"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 525to bring those who have a lot of clinging to [the state of] lacking clinging, (22) to bring those who lack the riches of the noble ones to the riches of the noble ones, [(23) to bring the sick to being without sickness,]2012 (24) to bring those without the light of wisdom to the light of wisdom, (25) to bring those who do not understand the three realms to understanding them, (26) to bring those who have entered2013 the left-sided path to the right[-sided path], (27) to bring those who are attached to body and life-force to lacking attachment to them, (28) [with bodhisattvas’ seeing that sentient beings] are separated from the [three] jewels, while [ultimately] they do not inter­rupt [the continuum of] the disposition of the [three] jewels, to bring them to [the realization of] not interrupting [the continuum of that disposi­tion],2014 (29) to bring those who deviate from the dharma to embracing the dharma, (30) to bring those without the six recollections to [cultivating] these six, (31) to bring those with the obscurations of the afflictions [and karma] to being without afflictions [and karma], and (32) to bring those who possess nonvirtuous dharmas to [the perfection of all] virtuous dhar­mas. “W hy are these called activities’?” Because they promote the welfare of sentient beings.[Second, as for the attributes of the victors, R G W ’s passage] “After the discussion of that . . teaches the eighty divisions of the attributes of the victors. By way of that, the [remaining three vajra points of] awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity are taught.From among these three, first, after one has attained the sixteen great [aspects of] awakening, sixteen [corresponding forms of] great compassion engage those who have not attained those [aspects of awakening]. These are the sixteen [kinds] of compassion of great awakening. They are ex­plained by way of their essences, which are explained as follows. (1) One consists of [the phrase] “without root and without ground.” [This means that] after one has attained the awakening that is without root and with­out ground,2015 one’s great compassion engages [by thinking], “These sen­tient beings shall realize the awakening that is without root and without ground!” [The same] applies to all [fifteen remaining forms of great com­passion].

Rather, [the text] explains that the [above] thirty-two qualities perform thirty-two [kinds of] enlightened ac­tivity that accord with these qualities. Therefore, it is these very thirty-two qualities that [also] represent the thirty-two [kinds of] enlightened activity.2.1.1.2.3. Conclusion[This corresponds to R G W ’s passage] “In this way, the seven vajra points ...” Now [follows:]20362.1.2. The explanation of presenting the connection2037 between the scriptures and the treatiseFrom the Buddha [comes] the dharma and from the dharma, the noble samgha.From the samgha, the [tathagata] heart—the basic element of wisdom—is attained.Finally, the attainment of that wisdom is the attainment of the supreme awakening and so onThat is endowed with the attributes that promote the welfare of all sentient beings. 1.3[This corresponds to R G W ’s passage] “W hat is the connection between these [seven points]?...” You may wonder, “W hat is the difference between the connection between the scriptures and the treatise [on the one hand] and matching the root text2038 with scripture [in] the above verse [1.2 on the other hand]?” [Maitreya would] say, “Matching the root text with scripture [in 1.2 means that] there is an explanation of the seven vajra points in the scriptures.

[Brief] introductionAs for connecting [the preceding verses of the Uttaratantra with the fol­lowing], the reason for teaching [the jewel of] the Buddha first is adduced [in RGVV’s sentence that ends in] “the nature of phenomena.”2040 You may wonder, “Which persons take [refuge]?” [R G W says,] “those sentient beings.” “What kind of sentient beings?” “[Those] who are guided by the Tathágata,” that is, those with the maháyána disposition who have faith in the Buddha and have faith in activities related to the Buddha.2041 By virtue of its being these persons who take [refuge], this becomes a stable taking of refuge because they do not revert [from it] after they have taken refuge. “In which object do they take [refuge]?” “In the Tathágata,” that is, in the Bud­dha endowed with eight characteristics. “For what reason do they take [ref­uge]?” “Due to their openness.”2042 “Which kind of open confidence?” “[The one] that is the natural outflow of the nature of phenomena.” The present open confidence in the Buddha serves as the concordant cause of realizing the dharmakáya at a [certain future] time. When they take refuge in the Buddha through their open confidence, they also take refuge in the dharma spoken by him as well as in his retinue, the samgha. “For what reason do they take [refuge in the dharma and the samgha]?” “Due to their openness that is the natural outflow of the nature of phenomena.” Since this is just as in the case of the eyes of a Kata2043 bird, [the phrase “openness that is the natural outflow of the nature of phenomena”] applies to both [taking refuge in the Buddha and taking refuge in the dharma and the samgha].Here, the essence of the Buddha is the ultimate Buddha—the dhar­makáya. Its qualities are (1) six in terms of substance and (2) two in terms of name.You awakened yourself to peaceful2044 buddhahood without beginning, middle, or end.Upon your awakening, you taught the fearless everlasting path so that those who lack realization may realize.I bow to you who wield the supreme sword and vajra of knowledge and loving-kindness, cut the sprouts of suffering to pieces,And break through the wall of doubts surrounded by the thicket of various views. 1.4(1) As for the [six qualities in terms of substance, the phrase] “w ithout beginning, middle, or end” {454} refers to the [Buddha s] quality of being unconditioned.2045 In due order, these three words correspond to there"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"530 Translationsbeing no arising [in the sense] of what had not originated before originating in dependence on a collection of causes and conditions, there being no abiding in between arising and ceasing, and there being no ceasing, once the power of those causes and conditions has become exhausted. “Peaceful” refers to the quality of being effortless, which [can] simply be understood by the commentary. “You awakened yourself to buddhahood” refers to the quality of not being realized through other conditions. For example, there is no benefit in saying to those who have eye sense faculties with blurred vision [caused by] a web of phlegm, “There are not two moons.” However, after that blurred vision has been terminated, they realize that [there is only] one moon, even if that is not demonstrated [to them]. Likewise, until the two obscurations have become pure, [sentient beings] do not realize the statement of spiritual friends (the condition of others explaining the dharma) “The dharmakaya is endowed with twofold purity.” However, when the two obscurations have become pure, self-arisen wisdom arises and realizes the [dharmakayas twofold purity] in the m anner of experiencing it personally. This self-arisen wisdom exists now but is not realized due to the two obscurations. “Awakening” refers to knowledge, that is, [the Buddha] himself knowing the above three [qualities]. Since [the Buddha], upon his awakening, is “the one who proclaims the path that the protector himself sees,” this corresponds to “you taught the path.” “Which kind of path does he teach?” It is the fearless everlasting path. Since this is the supramundane path, it is fearless2046 of samsara. Once attained, it does not revert, and therefore it is everlasting. “For what purpose is it [taught]?” “So that those who lack realization may realize.” It is [taught] so that, or in order that, [all] sentient beings who lack the realization of the first three qualities may realize them. This teaches compassion. Now, the essence of power is the power of accomplishing the welfare of sentient beings through knowledge and compassion2047 without obstruction. There are three ways of identifying that [power]. “If having power is identified, it is the power that exists in what?” [It exists in] “knowledge and loving- kindness”—it is the power that exists in these two because it is by virtue of these two that the welfare [of beings] is promoted through turning the unequaled wheel of dharma. “If an example for this power is identified, what kind of example is it?” [The example is to] “wield the supreme sword and vajra”—it is said that [this power] resembles a sword because it cuts through and that it resembles a vajra because it destroys. “If the object of this power is identified, it is the power of being powerful with regard to which object?” This is stated [in the phrase] “cut the sprouts of suffering to"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 531pieces, and break through the wall of doubts surrounded by the thicket2048 of various views.” The explanation of that [can] be simply understood by the commentary.(2) As for the two [qualities] in terms of name, they correspond to what the root text explains below through the distinct [explanation].2049 [With regard to that,] the commentary explains that the first four [among the six qualities in terms of substance] represent ones own welfare, while the latter two represent the welfare of others. {455} It is to be analyzed below what the intention of these two [sets of qualities] is.2.2.1.1.1.2.-3.

Identifying the essence of the six qualities of the Buddha by way of explaining merely the meaning of the root textAmong these six [qualities], in the context of not being realized through other conditions, [R G W says] that udaya2051 is asserted here [to mean] “clear realization” but not “arising.” In Sanskrit, there is this term “udaya.” Through the power of conditions, it applies to two [different meanings]. This means that if one says parapratyayodaya (“realized through other conditions”),2052 it applies to “clear realization.” Therefore, here, it refers to that, that is, to the assertion that the dharmakaya is clearly realized through self-arisen wisdom in the manner of experiencing it personally. However, if one says btjodaya (“arising of a seed”),2053 it pertains to arising, which is not the case [here]. Why? For the dharmakaya would be conditioned if it pertained to arising.As for the essence of knowledge, it is explained [by line I.7c] “Thus, it is knowledge because it realizes those three aspects” in the root text. There­fore, [R G W says,] “Even though it is unconditioned and has the character­istic of being inactive, from tathágatahood. . . ” Hence, it is unconditioned. [R G W s passage] “all activities . .. until the end of samsára” teaches that it is effortless. [R G W s passage] “Thus, buddhahood . . . not caused by a master” teaches that it is not realized through other conditions.2.2.1.1.2.2. [Detailed] explanation [of their individual characteristics] through matching them with the scripturesOne may think, “Are such six qualities of the Buddha [in terms of sub­stance] not arbitrary?” They are not—[R G W ] teaches that they are ex­plained in the Sarvabuddhavisayávatárajñánálokálamkárasütra. Thus, [R G W says], “The instruction on the detailed . . .” Here, [the qualities] that are present as the six points [above] are explained together under the categories of knowledge and compassion through matching them with the scriptures. This has two parts: (1) the actual scriptural phrases and (2) pre­senting the explanation of these scriptural phrases.(1) From among the six phrases in the [Sarvabuddhavisayavatara- jñándlokalamkdra]sütra,2054 the first four are the scriptural phrases on knowledge. The first sütra phrase is “Here, Mañjusrl... all phenomena's having such a nature.” The second one is “has completely and perfectly awakened.” The third one is “has seen the dharmadhatu of sentient be­ings.” The fourth one is “to be impure, not stainless, and blemished.” [RGW'] matches [these phrases with knowledge, saying] that they express the Tathágata's being endowed with wisdom. {456} Two sütra phrases are"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 533scriptural phrases on compassion. The fifth one is “which is called ‘playful mastery,’ for [all] sentient beings.” The sixth one is “the Tathagata . . . his great compassion . . . unfolds . . .” [R G W ] matches [these phrases with compassion, saying] that they express the Tathagatas being endowed with compassion.(2) Presenting the explanation of these scriptural phrases has six parts, that is, the first words of each [explanatory passage in R G W ] are taken and matched [with the above sütra phrases] in due order: (a) “all phenomena,” (b) “completely and perfectly,” (c) “of sentient beings,” (d) “Impure,” (e) “playful mastery,” and (f) “That this compassion . . It is said that “cer­tain”2055 refers to those who are certain as the three of érâvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, or bodhisattvas, that is, [those whose disposition can] not be taken away by conditions. “Uncertain” refers to those who are not certain as those three, that is, [those whose disposition can] be taken away by conditions. “Certain in terms of what is mistaken” refers to those whose disposition is cut off.We think that those who have entered the means [for liberation] (srâ­vakas and pratyekabuddhas) and those who crave for neither [samsàra nor nirvàna] (bodhisattvas) represent the sentient beings [whose dispo­sition] is certain in terms of what is correct. Those who crave to be free from [samsâric] existence but have entered what is not the means [for liberation]—the three of the tlrthikas, the Vàtsïputrïyas,2056 and the per­sons full of pride who entertain views about emptiness—are those whose disposition is uncertain. Those with great desire who crave for [samsâric] existence—the Lokâyatas—and the Sendhapas2057 who have fallen into the hïnayàna are the sentient beings [whose disposition] is certain in terms of what is mistaken. “Through what does one know this?” It is explained in the commentary on the causes [for awakening] the basic element below.2058As for matching power with the scriptures, this consists of [RGVV’s pas­sage] “Thereafter, due to the unfolding of unsurpassable wisdom and .. .” [In this passage,] “engages” refers to demonstrating the twelve deeds [of a buddha].2.2.1.1.2.3.

Presenting another explanation"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"534 Translations2.2.1.1.2.3.1. Commenting on the meaning of the root textOne’s own welfare is by virtue of the first three qualities,And the welfare of others, by virtue of the latter three. I.8cd[R G W s direct] comment on the intention of the root text’s saying that the first three are one’s own welfare and the latter three are the welfare of others is [the passage] “Here, from among these six qualities of the Tathagata. . . ”2.2.1.1.2.3.2. Presenting another explanationThe author of the commentary [alternatively] provides the explanation that the first four [qualities] present one’s own welfare and the latter two present the welfare of others. The meaning of this being explained in this way corresponds to [R G W ’s phrase] “Or, [one can say that] it is [the qual­ity of] wisdom that elucidates the fulfillment of one’s own welfare.” You may wonder, “W hy is wisdom one’s own welfare?” The reason [for this is found in R G W ’s phrase] “which is due to its having the property of be­ing the basis of the completely perfect self-awakening that is the supreme and eternal abode of peace.” As for knowledge, [Uttaratantra 1.7c] explains, “Thus, {457} it is knowledge because it realizes those three aspects.” There­fore, [the phrase] “the supreme and eternal” represents [buddhahood’s first aspect or] quality of being unconditioned. “The abode of peace” refers to [all] karma, afflictions, reference points, and thoughts’ being primordially at peace, which is the quality of being effortless. “The completely perfect self-awakening” refers to not being realized through other conditions. Since these three [aspects or qualities] are realized by wisdom, all suffering that exists in [a buddhas] own mind stream is at peace. Therefore, [wisdom] is presented as one’s own welfare.“But is that not contradictory to the root text explaining, ‘One’s own welfare is by virtue of the first three qualities and the welfare of others, by virtue of the latter three’?” There is no contradiction here. In the root text, it is the promotion of the welfare of others through the wisdom of subsequent attainment that is explained as knowledge’s being one’s own welfare. The explanation of “Thus, it is knowledge because it realizes those three aspects” by the commentary presents [knowledge] as one’s own wel­fare with the intention that all one’s own suffering is at peace through [the wisdom of] meditative equipoise knowing these three [aspects or qualities] just as they are. “Through what does one know that meditative equipoise"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 535promotes ones own welfare, while subsequent attainment promotes the welfare of others?” In the chapter on instructions and directions [of the Mahäyänasüträlamkära], it is said:Nonconceptual wisdomIs what purifies the buddha attributes.The other one, which establishes accordingly,Is what matures sentient beings.2059“So is knowledge then not necessary in order to promote the welfare of others through turning the wheel of the Buddha’s speech in three stages due to his compassion and power?” It is [of course] necessary but since the knowledge of the welfare of others is included in power, it is not mentioned separately. For one’s own welfare, it is necessary to realize the three qualities [of buddhahood] (such as its being unconditioned), and what is necessary for that is the knowledge that is the wisdom of meditative equipoise. Thus, since it is the primary [form of wisdom], it is taught explicitly.2.2.1.2. Explanation [of the essence] of the dharm aThis has two parts:1. The meaning of the root text2.

Among these, it is the latter that is referred to [here]. It has two parts: (1) since it is that which is to be realized, it is the dharma of realization that is cessation and (2) since it is that which realizes this, it is the dharma of realization that is the path. (1) The Sautrántikas assert [cessation such that] the five appropriating skandhas, which abide earlier through being established as2060 the nature of suffering, become utterly nonexistent later through having cultivated the path or the remedies, just as ice on a lake having melted, clouds in the sky having disappeared, or a lamp, whose oil and wick are exhausted, [having become extinguished]. This is not [how cessation] is asserted [here]—the natural cessation of the maháyána is the dharmakaya. {458} [However,] this is not the dharmakaya that consists of the fruition of the path2061 but rather the dharmakaya that consists of the path. You may wonder, “W hat difference is there between this cessation that is the dharma [of realization] and buddhahood?” This cessation refers to the causes and results that consist of the path of learning—it is the nature of phenomena that exists during the phases of the path of seeing and the path of familiarization relinquishing the factors to be relinquished through seeing and the factors to be relinquished through familiarization as is appropriate. [On these paths,] there are still remaining factors to be relinquished to be relinquished and remaining factors to be attained to be attained. Buddhahood consists of the path of nonlearning, on which there is no remaining factor to be relinquished to be relinquished and no remaining factor to be attained to be attained. “So what difference is there between the cessation that exists on the buddhabhümi (the fruition of the path) and buddhahood?” There is no difference, [they refer to the same states simply] being labeled with different names. Or, there is no difference in essence, but they are different isolates. “How so?” [This state is referred to as] cessation from the perspective of the expanses being free from adventitious stains. From the perspective of wisdom s being free from adventitious stains, it is [referred to as] buddhahood. It is stated in this text in such a way too:Being the fully perfect awakening in all aspects2062And the relinquishment of [all] stains and their latent tendencies,Buddhahood and nirvanaUltimately are not two.2063"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 537(2) As for the dharma of realization that is the path, since it is that which realizes [this cessation], it is presented as the remedies that actually relinquish the [corresponding] factors to be relinquished. Therefore, among the four paths, the path of accumulation merely invalidates [its factors to be relinquished], and the path of preparation merely suppresses [its factors to be relinquished]. Hence, since there is no actual relinquishment of the seeds of the afflictions through these two [paths], they are not presented [as the path] here. Rather, [the actual path] consists of the path of seeing and the path of familiarization. These two have the two [phases of] meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. Among them, subsequent attainment takes all kinds of phenomena as objects and is merely that which assesses the [preceding] realization of the nature of phenomena during meditative equipoise, but it is not the remedy for the seeds of the afflictions. Therefore, it is not presented [as the path] here, but [the path consists of] meditative equipoise. This [meditative equipoise] is also twofold: the uninterrupted2064 path and the path of liberation. Among them, the path of liberation is the manifestation of the fundamental change that is relinquishment and therefore is not presented [as the path] here. Rather, it is the uninterrupted path that serves as the remedy that [actually] relinquishes the factors to be relinquished.2065 “Through what does one know that Maitreya2066 asserts the essence of the dharma that is the path as being the remedy that relinquishes the factors to be relinquished?” Because he explains [in I.9cd], “I bow to this sun of the genuine dharma, which . . . defeats [passion], aggression, and [mental] darkness.”This [dharma] has eight qualities, (1) six in terms of substance and (2) two in terms of name. (1) Among the six in terms of substance, cessation has three [qualities]. First, the quality of being inconceivable2067 is to be understood through three reasons. “W hat [are they]?” [First,] with regard to all thinkings {459} being done by way of dialectics, [Uttaratantra I.9a says that cessation] is not an object of dialectics. “Through what does one know this?” With regard to dialecticians assessing [all phenomena] as [one or the other among] the four extremes, [the text says that] the reality of cessation is free from the four extremes. “How is it free?” With regard to some dialecticians, such as the Lokayatas, assessing [phenomena] as non­existent, [it says that] the reality of cessation is not nonexistent. With re­gard to some dialecticians, such as those who propound Hvara as the cause [of the world], assessing [phenomena] as existent, [it says that] the reality of cessation is not existent. With regard to some dialecticians assessing [phenomena] as the third possibility in terms of affirmation (“being both"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"538 Translationsexistent and nonexistent”), [it says that] the reality of cessation is not both existent and nonexistent either. With regard to some dialecticians assess­ing [phenomena] as the third possibility in terms of negation (“being nei­ther existent nor nonexistent”), [it says that] the reality of cessation is not neither existent nor nonexistent. Therefore, it says, “inscrutable as other than existent and nonexistent.”2068As for the second reason, with regard to all thinking s being done by way of terms, [the text] says that the reality of cessation is “free from etymo­logical interpretation.” In the commentary, it is explained that it is beyond being an object of the terms that are known in the world and beyond being an object of the terms that are known in the treatises.As for the third reason, with regard to all thinkings being done in de­pendence on other thinking, [the text says that] the reality of cessation is to be personally experienced by the nonconceptual wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas.“Peaceful” teaches two meanings—since karma and afflictions are at peace in the reality of cessation it is peaceful. This teaches the quality of being free from the dual. It is [also] peaceful since [all] conception that is improper mental engagement—the cause that motivates karma and afflic­tions—is at peace. This represents the quality of being nonconceptual.The dharma of realization that is the path, since it is that which realizes [this cessation, also] has three qualities. “Stainless” represents the quality of being pure—the two paths [of seeing and familiarization] lack the stains of the afflictions to be relinquished through seeing and to be relinquished through familiarization. “Endowed with the shine of the light rays of wis­dom ” represents the quality of being luminous, referring to being endowed with the shine of the wisdom of realizing true reality. “Defeats passion, aggression ...” represents the quality of serving as the remedy for [all] an­tagonistic factors. How the genuine dharm a is similar to the sun is clearly explained in the commentary.(2) As for the two [qualities] in terms of name, since the first three [qual­ities] are referred to as “what is free from desire,” they are the dharma that is cessation (what is free from desire). Since the latter three [qualities] are referred to as “what makes free from desire,” they are the dharm a that is the path (what [makes] free from desire).2.2.1.2.1.2.-3.

[This assertion] is not what is taught as cessation [here]. “How is it not taught [in that way]?” [This is answered by RGVV’s saying,] “As [the Sarvabuddhavisayavatara- jhandlokdlamkarasutra] says: ‘Manjusrl, in what lacks arising and lacks ceasing, mind, mentation, and consciousness do not operate.’” If [the term] “m ind” is explained based on an uncommon reason for applying that term, [that is,] in the sense of accumulated,2070 “m ind” refers to the alaya[-con- sciousness]. Since mentation is the thinking that is conceited about “me” and a self,2071 “mentation” refers to the afflicted mind. Since consciousness is clearly aware of all kinds of focal objects,2072 “consciousness” refers to the [remaining] six collections [of consciousnesses].2073 “At the time of the sutra, how does this become2074 a scriptural passage that contradicts [this cessation’s here] being the cessation of the sravakas?” Because the sravakas that are Sautrantikas assert cessation as the subsequent ceasing of the five appropriating skandhas that existed from the beginning, whereas in this [sutra], the five appropriating skandhas are explained as lacking arising and ceasing.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. Instruction on there being a scripture that establishes [this cessation] as being the cessation of the Madhyamikas in the mahayanaThis consists of [RGVV’s passage] “As [the Srimaladevisimhanadasutra] says: ‘However, Bhagavan, the cessation of suffering is not the destruction"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 541of phenomena.'” [As for the phrase] “permanent, eternal, peaceful, in­destructible” [in this passage, the cessation here] is permanent because it lacks arising. It is eternal because it lacks aging. It is peaceful because it lacks sickness. {461} It is indestructible because it is without being harmed. [However,] these four do not refer to the lack of the four, such as arising, that exist in the mind streams of sentient beings. They consist of the lack of the arising of a mentally created body of bodhisattvas, the lack of the aging that is the maturation of uncontaminated karmic formations, the lack of the sickness that is the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, and the lack of the death and the transition that are an inconceivable transfor­mation. “Why?” As for being permanent, [Uttaratantra 1.79 says,] “[The tathágata elements] character does not change into anything other because it has the nature of being inexhaustible.” As for being eternal, [it says,] “It is the refuge of beings because it has no end in time.” As for being peaceful, [it says,] “It is always nondual because it is nonconceptual.” As for being indestructible, [it says,] “It also has the nature of indestructibility because its nature is to be uncreated.” Thus, the same applies to the cases below that accord with this.2.2.1.2.2.2.

As for the seeds, in terms of what inputs latent tendencies, [RGVV says,] “which are preceded by mentally engaging in focal objects that have the characteristic of being unreal entities.” These are the conceptions of clinging to what is not something as being that something. In terms of the latent tenden­cies that are input through these conceptions, [it says,] “their latencies.” In terms of manifest [afflictions, it says,] “Due to the rising of . . . passion, hatred, and bewilderment... arise.” [The two remaining afflictivenesses of] karma and birth are explained through this [passage’s] implicitly pointing to them.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.2.

The gist of this is that through the prajna of the triad of studying, reflecting, and medi­tating, one realizes the nature of phenomena as equality—neither is any primordially existent affliction to be removed nor is the dharmadhatu to be added.

This is taught in the text by [line I.13a] “T h ey ... is peace.” This essence exists on the first bhumi and above. “From which causes does this essence arise?” It arises from two [causes]—{463} because of realizing that the natural luminosity of the m ind exists primordially and [because of] seeing that the adventitious afflictions, which are w ithout nature, are [indeed] nonexistent. This is explained by the first2081 line of verse. There­fore, that the wisdom of knowing suchness does not exist on the path of preparation and below is because of the nonexistence of these two causes [on the paths of accumulation and preparation]. The wisdom of knowing variety is to see that there is no one among all sentient beings who is not pervaded by the buddha element—the dharmadhatu. This is taught by [the phrase] “those who see that perfect buddhahood is all-pervading.”Now, the explanation of the difference between these two wisdoms [lies in the phrase] “who possess unobscured intelligence,” which refers to be­ing liberated from the obscurations of attachment through the wisdom of knowing suchness and being liberated from the obscurations of obstruc­tion through the wisdom of knowing variety. Since [line 1.13d] summarizes these two wisdoms, [the phrase] “being endowed with the wisdom vision"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 545of the purity of sentient beings” summarizes the wisdom of knowing such­ness and “being endowed with the wisdom vision of having infinite ob­jects” summarizes [the wisdom of] knowing variety.[2.2.I.3.I.2.

In the commentary, [there is] (1) the explanation of just the meaning of the root text and (2) the explanation by matching this with the scriptures. The first one has three parts:(a) Essence(b) Cause(c) Instruction on its being difficult to realize(la) The essence is represented by [R G W s sentence] “Here, [the wis­dom of knowing the tathagata heart as] being suchness2082 ... ‘persons and phenomena.’” “Phenomena” refers to the world that is the [outer] con­tainer. “Persons” refers to the sentient beings who are the inner contents."},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"546 TranslationsYou may wonder, “Why is the world that is the container called ‘going’?” Because it moves on2083 without remaining for a second moment.(lb) “From which cause does the wisdom of knowing suchness arise?” This is explained by [R G W s next two sentences] “This is the realization in terms of . . . ”(lc) The meaning of the instruction on its being difficult to realize is this: Since the luminous mind and the afflicted mind are not different in the uncontaminated expanse, two mutually exclusive attributes come together in a single bearer of these attributes. You may say, “If natural luminos­ity is pure, this is mutually exclusive with being impure. If it is impure, this is mutually exclusive with being pure.” In terms of entities, these two are not different in the dharmadhatu. Therefore, it is taught that this is difficult to realize by ordinary beings. You may wonder, “By what is it re­alized that these two are not mutually exclusive?” It is realized by the wis­dom of knowing suchness that exists on the first bhümi. “So are they then mutually exclusive or not mutually exclusive in terms of entities?” {464} [In general,] if two mutually exclusive attributes come together in a single bearer of these attributes, they are mutually exclusive. Here, [the author] has in m ind that the bearer of these attributes [luminous m ind and afflicted mind] consists of the two realities. [When speaking of] natural purity, he has ultimate reality in mind, whereas [when he speaks of] impurity, he has seeming reality in mind. The text [passage] on this is “Now, these two [fac­tors]—‘m inds natural luminosity' and . . . ” As for [the phrase] “both sound and unsound minds [always] occur alone, without [one of them ever] being associated with the other one,” since m ind is momentary, at the time of a sound mind's occurring, there is no occurrence of an unsound mind at the same time, and at the time of an unsound mind's occurring, there is no occurrence of a sound mind at the same time. “Sound m ind” refers to the wisdom of realizing luminosity. “Unsound m ind” refers to the adventitious dependent2084 mind. Since these two are the remedy and what is to be relin­quished, respectively, they do not operate at the same time.(2) As for the explanation by matching this with the scriptures, ŠrlmáládevI said to the Bhagavan:Bhagavan, I think that this naturally pure tathágata heart that is prox- imately afflicted by adventitious proximate afflictions is the object of the Tathágata, thus being inconceivable. Why is that?2085"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 547What is found after that [in the Srimaladevisutra] is the instruction on the reason for [this point’s] being difficult to realize.

As for being difficult to realize [in terms of] the first one, [R G W says]:Therefore, [the Srimaladevisutra] says:Bhagavan, the sound mind is momentary.

The explanation of the reason for the srâvaka sam gha’s not being m entioned hereHere, there is this question, “With the érâvaka samghas being mentioned in this Dhâranisvararâja[sütra] ([saying] right after [the phrase] ‘[the Buddha] was endowed with limitless very disciplined assemblies of disci­ples’2088 that ‘[he resided] together with a great bhiksu samgha’),2089 why is it solely the bodhisattva samgha that is mentioned in the UttaratantraV’ The answer to this thought [is found in R G W ’s phrase] “There is no men­tion of the jewel of the srâvaka samgha after the jewel of the assembly of bodhisattvas.” “So is the mentioning of the érâvaka samgha in the sütra meaningless, or what is the reason for its being mentioned?” [R G W ] says that the srâvaka [samgha] “is not worthy of being venerated.” “Still, why is the srâvaka samgha not mentioned in the Uttaratantra?” [R G W ] explains [that this is] because the srâvaka samgha is not a refuge for bodhisattvas. “Well, why is it not a refuge?” It is established through both scripture and reasoning that it is not a refuge. First, the establishment through reasoning [corresponds to R G W s passage] “Indeed, no learned ones . . .” The es­tablishment through scripture [corresponds to the following passage with] the two verses [that begin with] “Indeed, it is to be said [here]: Those who nourish discipline performed for their own sake. . . ” The meaning of those [verses from a] sütra is to teach that, in general, those who do not possess the three trainings are not objects of refuge, and since the training in disci­pline is impure in sravakas [when compared to bodhisattvas], they are not an object of refuge.

The gist [of this]2.2.1.4.1.1. Meaning of the wordsSince it is easy to understand the gist if one understands the meaning of the words, the meaning of the words is explained first. Here, the commentary [implicitly] asks two questions. [The first question asks,] “It is said in the prajnaparamita sutras that the three jewels are the protectors of sentient beings who lack a protector and the refuges of those who lack a refuge. So in terms of which reasons did the Bhagavan present the three refuges?” [The Uttaratantra] says:For the purpose of the teacher, the teaching,2090 and the disciples,The three refuges are presented I.19abThe second question is: “In terms of which persons did the Bhagavan present the three refuges?” [The Uttaratantra] says:The three refuges are presentedW ith regard to those in the three yanasAnd those who have faith in the three activities.2091 1.19bd{466} Thus, [there] are three reasons and six [kinds of] persons.Now the meaning of the commentary is explained. It is [first] explained by covering each reason and each of the two [kinds of] persons [in due order]. As for the six [kinds of] persons, as entities, they are those with the three dispositions, that is, those with the dispositions of sravakas, pratyeka- buddhas, and bodhisattvas. They become six because each one of them is divided into two—the persons who strive for definite excellence2092 and the persons who strive for the higher realms. The three persons with faith in the three yanas are the persons who strive for definite excellence. The three"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"550 Translationspersons with faith in the three activities are the persons who strive for the higher realms.Now, this is explained by not following the order of the text. This cor­relates to R G W s phrase] “the Buddha is a refuge with regard to the persons in the bodhisattvayána.”2093 “Based on what reason do they take refuge in the Buddha?” [RGW'] says, “For the purpose of demonstrating the qual­ities of the teacher.” Thus, the reason for demonstrating the qualities of the Buddha (such as “The Bhagavan is the Tathagata Arhat, the completely perfect Buddha who is aware2094 and venerable”)2095 is that the Buddha is “the highest among humans.” After the triad of open confidence, longing confidence, and trusting confidence [in this sense] has arisen, they take ref­uge [by saying], “I take refuge in the Buddha, the highest among humans.” “If one takes [refuge] based on that reason, which person is it that takes [refuge]?” It is someone with the maháyána disposition who takes [refuge].Among the two [kinds of persons with the maháyána disposition], in the persons who strive for definite excellence, there arises the striving for, or the wish of, attaining the state of buddhahood for the welfare of oth­ers. Since one needs to practice the maháyána for that [to come true], it is the persons who are bodhisattvas with faith in the maháyána who take refuge by thinking, “I shall practice the maháyána and attain buddhahood.” Or, based on the reason of demonstrating the qualities of the teacher, after the threefold confidence as above has arisen in them, the persons with the maháyána disposition who strive for the higher realms take refuge in the Buddha by thinking, “I shall attain the bodies and possessions of gods and humans in the next [life].” In order to attain those, they must perform the necessary activities of gathering the accumulations [of merit and wisdom] with regard to the Buddha. Therefore, those who have faith in the supreme activities related to the Buddha take refuge by thinking, “I shall perform the activities of gathering2096 [the accumulations] with regard to the Buddha.”Or, with regard to those with the pratyekabuddha disposition, [their taking refuge] correlates with [R G W s passage] “the dharma is a refuge.” [Thus,] someone with the pratyekabuddha disposition takes refuge in the dharma. “Based on what reason {467} do they take [refuge]?” [RGW '] says, “for the purpose of demonstrating the qualities of the teaching.”2097 [Thus,] based on the reason of demonstrating the qualities of the dharma (such as “The genuine dharma is virtuous in the beginning, virtuous in between, virtuous in the end, of excellent meaning, and of excellent words” and “The dharma2098 that perfectly teaches the unmixed, completely perfect, com­pletely pure, and completely spotless pure conduct is what the wise should"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"know with discriminating awareness”), there arises the threefold confi­dence, [thinking,] “The dharma is the supreme among what is free from attachment.” Upon that, they take refuge [by saying], “I take refuge in the dharma, the supreme among what is free from attachment.” “If one takes [refuge] based on that reason, which person is it that takes [refuge]?” It is someone with the pratyekabuddha disposition who takes [refuge].Among the two [kinds of persons with the pratyekabuddha disposi­tion], the persons who strive for definite excellence think, “I shall realize the profound dharma of dependent origination by myself and shall at­tain the awakening of a pratyekabuddha.” Since one needs to practice the pratyekabuddhayâna for that [to come true], it is the persons [with] the pratyekabuddha [disposition and] faith in the pratyekabuddhayâna who take [refuge in this way]. Or, based on the reason of demonstrating the qualities of the teaching of the teacher, after the threefold confidence as above has arisen in them, the persons with the pratyekabuddha disposition who strive for the higher realms take refuge in the dharma, thinking, “I shall attain [the bodies and possessions of] gods and humans in the next [life].” In order to attain those, they must perform the necessary activities of gathering the accumulations [of merit and wisdom] with regard to the dharma. Therefore, those who have faith in the supreme activities related to the dharma take refuge in the dharma by thinking, “I shall perform the activities of gathering the accumulations with regard to the dharma.”With regard to those with the érâvaka disposition, [their taking refuge] correlates with [R G W ’s passage] “the samgha is a refuge.” “Based on what reason do those with the srâvaka disposition take refuge in the samgha?” [RGW ] says, “for the purpose of demonstrating the qualities of the dis­ciples who have well entered the teaching of the teacher.” [Thus,] based on the reason of demonstrating the qualities of the samgha (such as “The samgha consists of the eight persons2099 who have entered accordingly, have entered well, have entered straightforwardly, have entered appro­priately, and have entered in accordance with the dharma”), the threefold confidence arises [in them, thinking,] “The samgha is the supreme among assemblies.” Upon that, they take refuge [by saying], “I take refuge in the samgha, the supreme among assemblies.” “If one takes [refuge] based on that reason, which person is it that takes [refuge]?” It is someone with the srâvaka disposition who takes [refuge].Among the two [kinds of persons with the érâvaka disposition], the per­sons who strive for definite excellence think, “I shall realize the words that I heard from others and shall attain the awakening of a érâvaka.” {468}A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 551"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"552 TranslationsSince one needs to practice the ¿ravakayana for that [to come true], it is the persons in the sravakayana with faith in the ¿ravakayana who take [refuge in this way].

The gist of this]If explained through the gist [of this], there are four parts:1. Definition2. Purpose3. Persons4. Reasons(1) The definition [of taking refuge] is to take refuge in the three jewels that have already arisen in the mind streams of others. (2) As for the purpose, in the commentary it is said, “from the standpoint of seeming [reality] so that sentient beings enter this [dharma] system2100 in successive order.” [That is, people take refuge] for the sake of those with the three dispositions successively entering the three yanas in the manner of [successively] writing an [entire] message with words. Therefore, this is an explanation that brings out the aspect of the expedient meaning. (3) The persons [who take refuge] are of six [kinds]. These six are the three [kinds of] persons who have faith in the three yanas and the three [kinds of] persons who have faith in the three activities [related to the three jewels]. In actual fact, they are [simply] those with the three dispositions, as explained above. That those with the three dispositions take refuge in the three jewels as being different is [explained] in terms of the root text. [However,] without [any of the three jewels'] being primary, all three [persons] take refuge in all three [jewels], and the ritual is also performed in common [for all three], (4) The reasons [for taking refuge] are three, being for the purpose of the teacher, the teaching, and the disciples."},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 5532.2.I.4.2. The ultimate object of refugeBecause of being abandoned, because of having a deceptive nature, Because of being nonexistent, and because of being fearful,The twofold dharma and the noble assembly Are not the ultimate suprem e refuge. 1.20This has the two parts of the dharma and the samgha not being the ultimate objects of refuge. This refutation [here of their being the ultimate objects of refuge] is [presented] in terms of the dharma and the samgha of the sravakas. [The status of the dharma and samgha of] the mahayana is explained implicitly through being pointed to by this [refutation].As for the refutation of the dharma and the samgha of the Sravakas not being the ultimate objects of refuge, it is taught that the defining charac­teristics of an object of refuge are to be free from fear oneself, to be able to liberate others from fear, and to have an utterly stable essence, and since [the dharma and samgha of the Sravakas] lack these three [characteristics], they are not the [ultimate] objects of refuge. The first three reasons [in 1.20] teach that [the dharma and the samgha] lack permanence. The last [reason] teaches that they lack being free from fear themselves. When they lack these two [characteristics], it is implicit that they [also] lack the ability to liberate others from fear.You may wonder, “How does this refutation implicitly point to the dharma and the samgha of the mahayana being [proper] objects of ref­uge?” These four reasons [in 1.20] do not apply [to them]. Now, among the two [kinds of] dharma, since the dharma of the teachings {469} is not asserted as being the essence of the mahayana dharma, it does not need to be taught here. Rather, [the dharma’s being an object of refuge] refers to the dharma of realization. Among the two [kinds] of the [dharma of real­ization, this does not refer to] the path because [the path] is impermanent. Cessation is of two [kinds]. Among them, the cessation that consists of the fruition is buddhahood, which was already explained above and is also established as the [ultimate] object of refuge below. Here, the cessation that consists of the path refers to the cessations that are presented as the results of the [path] in dependence on the path because they are impermanent.The samgha is presented as the mahayana samgha that dwells on the ten bhumis. Therefore, since those on the seventh bhumi and below [need to] make efforts in order to [accomplish] the welfare of sentient beings, they lack the ability to liberate others from fear. Those who dwell on the"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"554 Translationsthree fruitional bhümis lack permanence because those on the eighth one proceed to the ninth one and those on the ninth one proceed to the tenth one. Therefore, it is not asserted that [the bodhisattvas on the bhümis] are correlated with [the phrase] “because of being fearful.”2101The commentary on this has three points: (1) explaining just the mean­ing of the root text, (2) matching being fearful with the scriptures, and (3) presenting the explanation of the scriptures. [Among them,] (2) [RGVV’s] explanation by matching [being fearful] with the scriptures consists of five sütra phrases. These five are “They are always fearful,” “take refuge in the Tathagata,” “search for final deliverance,” “[still] have to learn [more] and have [many more] things to do,” and “are [only] approaching unsurpass­able completely perfect awakening.”(3) As for presenting the explanation of these scriptural phrases, the first sütra phrase is explained by [the passage] “How are they fearful? . . . [In general, what constitutes a genuine] refuge does not seek refuge [else­where] .” The second sütra phrase is explained by “Just as sentient beings...” The third sütra phrase is explained by “Thus, since they have fear . . .” The fourth sütra phrase is explained by “Since they seek for deliverance from fear . . . ” The fifth sütra phrase is explained by “Since they [still] have to learn [more] . . . ”Ultimately, the refugeOf beings is the Buddha aloneBecause the sage possesses the dharmakayaAnd because he also is the consum m ation of the assembly. 1.21As for establishing the Buddha alone as the ultim ate object of refuge, he is established as an object of refuge because he is endowed with the [above] three defining characteristics of an object of refuge. “The sage” refers to [the Buddha’s] permanence because the commentary says, “By virtue of the principle stated earlier . . . the sage who is characterized2102 by being unarisen and unceasing.” [The phrase] “because . . . possesses the dharmakaya” explains that he himself is free from fear. [The phrase] “because he is also2103 the consum mation of the assembly” explains the ability to liberate others from fear because the Buddha2104 frees the samgha from all suffering and thus establishes it in the dharmakaya."},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 5552.2.1.5.

Therefore, why are the three rare and supreme ones called ‘jewels'?” It means that they are called “the three jewels” because there is a sixfold similarity with a jewel. In the commentary, this is explained in the manner of a detailed elaboration, and it is [also] explained in the manner of a brief summary.

In the middle, one reflects [on that dharma] through the prajna that arises from reflecting. In the end, one familiarizes [with that dharma] through the prajna that arises from mundane medita­tion. Through this, one attains the endpoint of the highest [mundane] med­itation and of the highest poised readiness—the supreme dharma. Through the path of seeing that is the yogic cognition that arises from this endpoint, the nature of phenomena is seen directly, which relinquishes the factors to be relinquished through seeing. Based on that, one familiarizes [with this nature of phenomena] again and again through the wisdom that arises from supramundane meditation and thereby attains the endpoint of the highest [supramundane] meditation and of the highest [level of the] ninth bhumi— the tenth bhumi. Thus, through the uninterrupted path that is the vajra-like samadhi (the end of the continuum of the ten bhumis), [all] afflictive and cognitive obscurations including their latent tendencies have been purified. Based on that, in the second moment [after the vajra-like samadhi], which is the [final] path of liberation, the dharmakaya is directly realized through2107 the yogic cognition that arises from the endpoint [of this samadhi]—the self-arisen wisdom of buddhahood. Through this, the buddhahood of a bhagavan completely and fully awakening to the equality of all phenom ­ena is obtained.

Since this [awakening] is neither without [qualities] nor of small qualities, [the phrase,] “through the buddha qualities (such as the ten powers)” represents the qualities that are based on that [awakening]. Since these qualities perform the enlightened activity that accords with these qualities, enlightened activity is represented by [the phrase] “performs the thirty-two kinds of tathagata activity.” Since the essence of enlightened activity is to explain the dharma, [RG W ' says] “by virtue of the voice of someone else,” which refers to buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ explaining the dharma. The dharma explained by buddhas consists of the words spoken from their mouths, while the one spoken by bodhisattvas consists of the words that are blessed [by buddhas], such as the Dasabhumikasutra. Based on that, {472} bringing down [the phrase] “based on one’s personal mental engagement in a proper m anner” from the context of the cause [above], the way in which the three jewels arise after the basic element has become pure through hearing and so on corresponds to how [this was explained] before.

Distinct explanationFrom among the five chapters [of the Uttaratantra], first, there is the expla­nation of [the basic element],2.2.2.2.I. The chapter on the basic elementThis chapter is explained through six points, and the reason that [the ba­sic element] must be determined through those six points is this: (1) This treatise is the one that determines the meaning of the sütra collection of definitive meaning. Therefore, in order to determine the intended m ean­ing of the statement in the Tathágatagarbhasütra that “All sentient beings possess the tathágata heart,” first, the comments on the intention of the scriptures of the Tathágata about the basic element are explained. (2) Now, beginning with the time of [trying to] make ordinary beings understand this basic element or [tathágata] heart that is explained in this way in the scriptures and exists in all sentient beings, it cannot be demonstrated [di­rectly]. Therefore, it needs to be determined through a tenfold presenta­tion. Hence, after the [first point], the determination of the basic element through this tenfold presentation is explained. (3) You may wonder, “If this basic element that is determined through that tenfold presentation in this way exists in all sentient beings, why do they not realize it?” [In response] to that, after the [tenfold presentation, there follows] the explanation of [how] it is established by way of nine examples that despite the existence [of the basic element] that is determined through that tenfold presentation, it is not realized. (4) You may think, “If such a basic element is not directly realized by sentient beings, based on which means should sentient beings ascertain it at the time of ascertaining that it exists in all sentient beings?” [In response] to that, [it is said,] “Ascertain it based on scriptures that teach the nature of phenomena!” In order to teach that, {473} after the [exam­ples], the means to ascertain it are explained. (5) You may wonder, “W hat is the essence or the defining characteristic of this basic element that is to be"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"560 Translationsascertained based on the scriptures that teach the nature of phenomena?” [In response] to that, in order to teach that the nature of phenomena is something that is free from superimposition and denial, after the [means to ascertain it], the basic elements defining characteristic and its own essence are explained. (6) You may wonder, “[If] sentient beings do not directly re­alize this basic element that is endowed with such a defining characteristic, what is the purpose of teaching the basic element in the Uttaratantra here by following the Tathagatagarbhasutra, [saying,] ‘all sentient beings possess the tathagata heart’?” [In response] to that, [it is said] that the purpose of the basic element’s not being realized directly and yet being taught is that it is discussed in order to relinquish the five flaws that obscure all paths. In order to teach that, after the [defining characteristic of the basic element], the purpose of teaching the basic element is taught at the very end of the first chapter].21082.2.2.2.1.1, Explanation of the comments on the intention of the scripturesSince the perfect buddhakaya radiates,Since suchness is undifferentiable,And since the disposition exists,All beings always possess the buddha heart. I.282109Here, [R G W ] explains, “These three topical points will be taught [in detail] below [through nine examples] according to the Tathagatagarbhasutra.” That is, these three [points] appear in detail by way of the examples that illustrate the purity [of the basic element] in the context of [the Uttaratantras saying] below:Its nature is the dharmakaya,Suchness, and also the disposition.2110Therefore, they are correlated [here] with that [section]. Consequently, this [verse here] is explained by taking up the meaning below. The basic element has three phases—the phase of its being pure, the phase of its being both pure and impure, and the phase of its being impure. The phrase “Since the perfect buddhakaya radiates” refers to the phase of its being pure. [In it,] “kaya” [means] the dharmakaya, which [actually] refers to all three kayas. “Through what does one know that?” Maitreya himself says [below]:"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 561The dharmakaya is to be known as twofold—The utterly stainless dharm adhátuAnd its natural outflow (teachingThe principles of profundity and diversity).2111“Radiates” [means] that these three kayas pervade all sentient beings. “How do they pervade them?” In order to purify the basic element of sentient beings for as long as samsara is not empty, with the dharmakaya functioning as the support, the sambhogakaya promotes the welfare [of sentient beings] through pervading the pure retinues who dwell on the bhümis, and the three [kinds of] nirmanakaya promote the welfare [of sentient beings] through pervading the impure retinues. Therefore, the basis to be purified—the [tathagata] heart or basic element—exists in [all] sentient beings. “Why?” If the basis to be purified—the basic element—did not exist [in sentient beings], their being pervaded by the three kayas would be pointless. Having that in mind, [Maitreya] says, “All beings always possess the buddha heart.”2112 Such is explained not only in the Uttaratantra alone but the Mahaydnasütrdlamkdra states:Just as space is asserted to be always omnipresent,This {474} is held to be always omnipresent.Just as space is omnipresent in the hosts of forms,It is omnipresent in the hosts of sentient beings.2113The phrase “since suchness is undifferentiable” refers to the phase of the basic elements being both pure and impure—the naturally pure suchness of buddhas and sentient beings is without any difference. This is declared in the Maháyánasütrálamkára [as follows]:Though it is without difference in everything,Suchness having become pure Is the Tathagata. Therefore,All beings possess its heart.2114[The phrase] “since the disposition exists” refers to the phase of the basic elements being impure—since the disposition of a tathagata exists in all sentient beings, it abides as what is suitable to give rise to the dharmakaya. Exactly this is explained [in the Uttaratantra] below:"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"562 TranslationsIt is held that the three buddhakayas Are obtained from these two dispositions—The first kaya, by virtue of the first one,And the latter two, by virtue of the second one.2115In its comments [on 1.31] below, which explain the essence [of the basic element, R G W says], “these three [points] were already mentioned above.”2116 This is clearly explained through these comments [here] on the intention of the scriptures.21172.2.2.2.1.2. Determ ining the basic element by way of a tenfold presentationThis has three points:1. Brief introduction by way of a synoptical verse on the number [of topics]2. Detailed explanation by differentiating the topics of the synopsis3. Concluding summary[2.2.2.2.1.2.1. Brief introduction by way of a synoptical verse on the num ber of topics]Nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment, engagement,Phases, and likewise the topic of all-pervasiveness, Ever-changelessness, and the inseparability of the qualities Are to be understood as representing the ultim ate expanse, the topic in mind. 1.29There are the ten topics of the synopsis, with the first one among them being [the nature].2.2.2.2.L2.1.1. The natureIn terms of the particular [characteristics of the nature of the basic ele­ment], during the phase of the basic elements being pure, the dharmakaya radiates into all sentient beings, thus possessing the power2118 to accom­plish the goals that sentient beings think about. Therefore, it is similar to a precious gem. During the phase of the basic elements being both pure and impure, the suchness of buddhas and sentient beings is undifferen- tiable. Therefore, it is similar to space. During the phase of the basic ele­m ents being impure, the mahayana disposition exists in all sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 563Therefore, it is similar to water since it moistens the mind streams [of be­ings] by way of compassion. In terms of its general characteristic, in anal­ogy with these three examples [of a jewel, space, and water] being pure by nature, their meaning refers to the basic elements being pure by nature.2.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. The causeThe following are the causes that make one realize what has not been re­alized. The persons who are those with great desire2119 have the obscu­ration that consists of aversion toward the mahâyâna dharma. Being concerned that this may arise in bodhisattvas [too], bodhisattvas cultivate its remedy—faith in the mahâyâna. The persons who are tlrthikas have the obscuration that consists of views about a personal self. As its remedy, bodhisattvas cultivate the lack of a self. The persons who are sravakas have the obscuration {475} that consists of fear of samsara’s suffering. As its remedy, bodhisattvas cultivate superior samâdhi. The persons2120 who are pratyekabuddhas have the obscuration that consists of indifference about the welfare of sentient beings.2121 As its remedy, bodhisattvas cultivate su­perior great compassion.2.2.2.2.L2.1.3. The fruition[Here,] there is no fruition of what has not arisen before being [newly] pro­duced, but one needs to realize what has not been realized before. “How?” Through cultivating faith in the mahâyâna dharma at the time of the cause, when the dharmakàya is attained later, the fruition that consists of the pàram ità of purity2122 [is attained]. Through cultivating superior prajna at the time of the cause, the fruition that consists of the pàramità of the su­preme self [is attained]. Through cultivating superior samâdhi at the time of the cause, the fruition that consists of the pàramità of bliss is attained. Through cultivating superior compassion at the time of the cause, when the dharmakàya is attained later, the fruition that consists of the pàramità of permanence is attained.2.2.2.2.I.2.I.4. The functionSince the naturally pure basic element exists [in beings, they develop] revul­sion due to the arising of weariness2123 based on seeing the shortcomings of samsâric suffering. Based on seeing the benefit of the bliss [of nirvàna], one gives rise to longing, wishing, striving, and aspiring for the object that is nirvâna. Thus, [the basic element] performs five functions."},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"564 Translations2.2.2.2.1.2.L5. The qualities of endowmentThis has two parts:1. Endowment with causes2. Endowment with results2.2.2.2.1.2.1.5.1. Endowment with causesThe basic element at the time of being a bodhisattva is endowed with three causes. “Which?” (1) The cause for later attaining the dharmakaya2124 is to cultivate faith in the maháyána dharma now. (2) The cause for later at­taining the wisdom of a victor is to cultivate superior prajñá and samádhi now. (3) The cause for the great compassion of a victor operating later is to cultivate superior great compassion now. [Thus, the basic element] is endowed with these three [causes].2.2.2.2.1.2.1.5.2. Endowment with resultsThe basic element [at the time of being] a buddha is inseparably endowed with three qualities. “Which?” It is inseparably endowed with the triad of(1) supernatural knowledges, (2) the wisdom of the termination of con­taminations, and (3) the termination of contaminations.2.2.2.2.I.2.I.6. The specification of manifestationThough the three [ways of the] basic elements [manifesting during its three phases] are inseparable, it is classified as three by way of the different bearers of the nature [of this basic element]. “Which?” [The three] repre­sent the basic element that exists in the bearers of this nature, which are the mind streams of sentient beings2125 (who are mistaken), the basic element that exists in the mind streams of bodhisattvas2126 (who are unmistaken), and the basic element that exists in the m ind streams of buddhas (who are perfectly unmistaken and free from reference points).Now there follows the explanation of the other four [topics] that are elaborations on [the topic of] manifestation. “How?”[2.2.2.2.I.2.I.7. Phases]It may be said, “Well, through making a threefold division of the basic el­ement, it follows that the basic element—the nature of phenomena—has three different pieces or essences.” [The response] to that is that though a threefold division {476} [of the basic element] is made, there are no differ­ent essences. Thus, it is presented by way of [three] different phases. For example, the single essence of [a person called] Devadatta is given different"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 565names during different phases—he is given different names [such as] the Devadatta who gathers grass, when he gathers grass, the Devadatta who carries water, and the Devadatta who grinds flour. Likewise, when [the ba­sic element] manifests in sentient beings, this is the phase of its being im ­pure.2127 Therefore, since this represents the phase of sentient beings, it is given the name “the basic element of sentient beings.” During2128 the phase of its being both pure and impure, it is given the name “the basic element of bodhisattvas.” W hen it manifests in buddhas, since it is the phase of its being completely pure, it is given the name “the basic element of buddhas.” In order to teach that, after the [topic of its manifestation, its three] phases are explained.[2.2.2.2.1.2.L8. All-pervasiveness]Elaborating on that, it may be said, “That [just] these phases are different is not established for me, but the [basic elements] essence itself is different. I do not assert that the phases themselves are different if the essence is not different.” [The response] to that concern is that if the essence is different, one [can]not assert that one pervades all. For example, a vase, a blanket, and a pillar, which [all] have different names,2129 do not pervade each other. Likewise, the same applies for the basic element. For example, now space2130 pervades inferior vessels (clay vases), m iddling vessels (copper vases), and supreme vessels (golden vases). Likewise, the basic element pervades the triad of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. In order to teach that, after the [topic of its phases, its] all-pervasiveness is taught.2.2.2.2.I.2.I.9. ChangelessnessElaborating on that, it may be said, “That [the basic element] pervades all is not established for me. For example, it is true that space pervades all, [but as far as] the meaning [of this example goes], the basic element does not pervade all—the basic element of sentient beings does not pervade the basic element of bodhisattvas, and the basic element of bodhisattvas does not pervade the basic element of buddhas.” [The response] to that concern is that if this were the case, the basic element would change—since the basic element of sentient beings would not pervade the basic element of bodhi­sattvas, a new basic element would arise in bodhisattvas, and since the basic element of bodhisattvas would not pervade the basic element of buddhas, a new basic element would arise in buddhas. Thus, just as space does not change,2131 the basic element does not change [either]. Thus, after the [topic of its all-pervasiveness, its] changelessness is taught."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"566 Translations[2.2.2.2.1.2.1.10. Inseparability]Elaborating on the changelessness [of the basic element] in the phase of its being completely pure (buddhahood) from among the three [phases of its] being changeless, it is taught that during the phase of its being com­pletely pure (buddhahood),2132 the four of the dharmakaya, the Tathágata, ultim ate reality, and nirvána are synonyms. {477} One may think, “Does nirvána [not] exist in šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas too?” W hen the four of the dharmakáya and so on are [used as] synonyms, with šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas not attaining the dharmakáya, they lack the attainment of the nirvána that is not different from the [dharmakáya]. In order to teach that, after the [topic of the changelessness of the basic element, the] inseparability from its qualities is taught.2.2.2.2.1.2.2.

In be­tween, the essence of the obscurations is explained [by R G W ’s passage] “Now, apart from those sentient beings who are firmly grounded in the mahâyâna... and not perceiving the tathàgata element.”2136 As for [R G W s sentence] below “These are the four kinds of obscurations of the four kinds of sentient beings,”2137 in the Indian manuscript, it does not occur below but is present here.2138 Therefore, the [above passage including this sen­tence] refers to the essence of the obscurations [as] in the root text.

In the root text, only the certainty about the negative concomitance appears, while in the commentary the negative concomitance is taught in [the quote from the ŠrímáládevJ]sutra and thereafter the"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 573certainty about the positive concomitance is taught too. In the root text, the [positive concomitance] is implied.(2) As for the second point, that [sentient beings] see the shortcomings of suffering in the object that is samsara {480} and see the benefit of hap­piness in the object that is nirvana coincides with whether the disposition exists or does not exist is established by way of its positive concomitance and its negative concomitance. [This is explained in] the second verse of the root text and its commentary.2147You may wonder, “W hat is the difference in meaning between these two verses?” [They refer to] cause and result—the cause for the arising of the weariness of samsáric suffering, [which is mentioned] in the former [verse], is the seeing of the shortcomings of suffering in the object that is samsara, [which is stated] in the latter [verse]. The cause for the arising2148 of the wish and so on for nirvana, [which is mentioned] in the former [verse], is the seeing of the benefit of happiness in the object that is nirvana, [which is stated] in the latter [verse]. Here, in the root text, both the certainty about the positive concomitance and the certainty about the negative concomi­tance are found, but their meaning is merely pointed to. In the commen­tary,2149 [we find the passage] “That persons with pure qualities see the flaws of suffering in samsara and see the qualities of happiness in nirvana occurs [only] when the disposition exists. [Thus,] this [seeing] is not something without a cause or something without a condition. For what reason [is this so]? If such [seeing] could happen without the disposition, without a cause, without a condition, and without entailing the termination of wrongdo­ing,2150 it would also happen2151 in those with great desire who are without the disposition for nirvana.” This means that it follows that the seeing of the shortcomings of samsara and the seeing of the benefit of happiness in nirvana would [also] arise [in those with great desire].Now, with regard to the explanation about the time of this [absurd] consequences being formulated, you may wonder, “At which time [does] it [apply]?” It follows that this twofold [seeing] would occur even2152 during the [entire] time of [sentient beings] not having given rise to faith in the dharma of one of the three [yánas]—the disposition for being pure of ad­ventitious stains—by way of bringing together the four wheels of relying on wise persons and so on. This actual piece of text [of R G W ] first pertains to the time of formulating this consequence, but now this consequence is to be reversed, which means that this twofold [seeing] does not occur at any time as long as [sentient beings] are not endowed with these four wheels."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"574 Translations“In relation to what is this reversal of the consequence here established?” It is established in relation to the first subject [in question].2153Now, this being established by way of scripture consists of [RGVV’s passage that quotes the Sarvabuddhavišayávatárajňánálokálamkárasútra], “Therefore, after that, the rays of wisdom . . .” The meaning of this sutra passage is that even these persons with wrong craving2154 thrive through vir­tuous dharmas because they have the naturally pure disposition. For if they did not have the naturally pure disposition, they would not thrive through the light rays of the wisdom of the tathágatas and virtuous dharmas. You may wonder, “Above it was explained that seeing samsára as a flaw {481} and seeing nirvana as a quality does not occur in those with wrong craving, who have the disposition of absolutely2155 not passing into nirvana. Is that not contradictory to the explanation in this sútra that [even] those with wrong craving generate virtue—the cause for meeting a buddha in the fu­ture?”2156 It is not contradictory—the above [explanation pertains] to the time of those with wrong craving not being endowed with the four wheels. In this [sutra] here, at the time of being struck by the light rays of the wis­dom of the Tathágata, their time of being endowed with the four wheels has come.(3) Now, the third point is the explanation of eliminating the flaw of the scriptural passages' [in the Sarvabuddhavišayávatárajňánáloká- lamkárasútra and the Maháparinirvánasútra] being mutually exclusive. Here, some think, “The above sútra passage and the statement in the [Maháparijnirvánasútra that those with wrong craving absolutely2157 do not pass into nirvana are contradictory.” The gist [of the answer to this] is that these two [statements] would be contradictory in a single sútra of definitive meaning, but here the sútras are different. The above sútra is a sútra of definitive meaning whereas that statement in the [Maháparij­nirvánasútra is a sútra passage of expedient meaning. Therefore, they are not contradictory. “Through what does one know that that statement in the [Maháparijnirvánasútra is of expedient meaning?” In order to teach that such is known because there is a basis of intention and an intention, [RGVV] says, “Also, the statement [in the Maháparinirvánasútra and oth­ers] that ‘those with great desire . . . ’” [The phrase] “for the sake of turning [such people] away from their hostility toward the maháyána dharm a” rep­resents the intention of the [Maháparinirvánasútra s] statement that bears an intention. [R G W s phrase] “another time” represents the basis of that intention. Now, that statement in the Maháparinirvánasútra [is known to] be of expedient meaning not only by virtue of there being these two"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 575[contrasting] sutra [passages], but it is known to be of expedient meaning by virtue of this sutra [itself]. In order to teach that, [RGVV] says, “Since the naturally pure disposition exists . . . ” It is said that the Brahman Sajjana [comments], “If this were not something with an intention, a valid cogni­tion that invalidates the explicit statement would not2158 be presented [here in R G W ].”21592.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.3.-6.

The proximate [or secondary] afflictions are twenty and are explained as the secondary afflictions. However, here, there is a differ­ence [between them in their] density.

(laal) Presenting the meaning consists of [R G W s passage that starts with] “This phase of bodhisattvas is to be understood in detail according to the [Sdgaramatipariprcchd] sutra.” Since each of these eight roots of virtue [listed at the beginning of this sutra passage] entails clinging and craving, it is from this point of view that they represent afflictions, which refer to [the elements in these eight that are] not being content, taking [birth], desiring, not being weary, making efforts, exerting themselves, not being separated, and not abandoning. The other [elements in these eight] represent virtues. Since it is within [the sphere of] these eight roots of virtue that [bodhi­sattvas] need to be reborn in samsara, these eight are the causes for their connecting with samsara. Some say, “These are [only] nominal afflictions— they are solely virtues.” This is not the case because if it were like that, {485} the term “associated with” in “the afflictions that are associated with roots of virtue” would not be justified. (Iaa2) Presenting the example consists of [the sutra passage] “O Sagaramati, suppose there were a distinguished householders . . .” (Iaa3) Establishing the similarity between the example and its meaning is represented by [the sutra passage] “Sagaramati, this ex­ample is given in order to make a certain meaning understood.” Through these three [passages in RGVV’s first quote from the Sagaramatipari- prcchasutra], the above explanation of the impure aspect [of the phase of bodhisattvas] is matched with the scriptures."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"584 Translations(lab) Now, [R G W s phrase] “However, these phenomena of birth and so on do not exist in them” [right before the first quote from the Sagara- matipariprcchasutra] is the explanation of the scriptural passage on the pure [aspect of the phase of bodhisattvas, which is represented by the sutra passage that says], “By virtue of being skilled in means and being embraced by prajna . . .” “Through what does one know such?” It is said that this is found in [R G W s further] explanation that follows this sutra passage.(lb) The explanation of this scriptural passage [on the pure and impure aspects] has two parts.

Similar to the eyes of a Kata bird, this [subject] applies to everything [in these verses] above and below it. “Is perm anent” is the thesis.2178 “Why?” Because it has the character that does not change into anything other. “And why is that?” Because it has the nature of being inexhaustible."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"588 TranslationsThe same applies [for the remaining reasonings: Again,] “the dhar­makaya” is the subject, and “is everlasting” is the thesis. “Why?” Because it is the refuge of all sentient beings. “Through what does one know this?” Because it has no end in time.[Again,] “the dharmakaya” is the subject, and “is peaceful” is the the­sis. “Why?” Because it is always without the duo of karma and afflictions. “Through what does one know this?” Because it is nonconceptual, that is, it lacks the conceptions of improper mental engagement, which are the cause that stirs karma and afflictions.2179[Again,] “the dharmakaya” is the subject, and {487} “is eternal” is the thesis. “Why?” Because it has the nature of indestructibility. “Through what does one know this?” Because its nature is to be uncreated by causes and conditions.

[Detailed explanation]It is not born, nor does it die.It is not impaired, nor does it ageBecause it is perm anent and everlasting,Because it is peaceful, and because it is eternal. 1.80“W hat meaning teaches the [detailed] explanation?”2180 It establishes that if something possesses the four characteristics of conditioned phenomena (such as being born), it changes, whereas the dharmakaya does not change because it lacks these four characteristics of conditioned phenomena.As for matching the words here, that the “it” in the beginning [of these verses] refers to the dharmakaya, which is the subject [of the reasonings], was [already] taken up above and applies to all four [reasonings]. “Is not born” is the thesis. “Why?” The reason appears in the latter half [of these verses]—“because it is perm anent.” “W hy is it permanent?” This was al­ready established [in I.79a] above through the two reasons “Because it has the character2181 that does not change into anything other and because it has the nature of being inexhaustible.” Likewise, taking the dharmakaya as the basis in the other three [reasonings] too, the first half of this verse teaches each probandum, while the latter half establishes each reason in due order. As for each reasons [here (such as being permanent)] being established, [the fact] that they are established through two reasons each— [which are those presented] in the [brief] introduction above—is to be understood as [explained] above."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 5892.2.2.2.I.2.2.2.2.7.2.3.I.3.

Therefore, this is explained [here], which means that [the dharmakaya] lacks the four [characteristics] of being born and so on of bodhisattvas. In that regard, the structure of each probative argument [consisting of subject, thesis, and reason] shall be provided. The subjects for the first two [reasonings] appear in the text, and it is just these former two [subjects] that are [also] taken as the subjects for the latter two [reasonings].2183 [Thus, “it”]—the dharmakaya—is the subject, and “is not born” is the thesis. “W hat kind of not being born [is this]?” The distinctive feature of the thesis is “[in the form] of a body of a mental nature.” “Why?” Because it is perm anent. “Why is it permanent?” This was already established through the two reasons “Because it has the character that does not change into anything other” and “because it has the nature of being inexhaustible” [in I.79a].In the latter three [reasonings], the three [phrases] “does not die,” “is not impaired,” and “does not age” are taken as the respective theses; the three [phrases] “because it is everlasting,” “because it is peaceful,” and “because it is eternal” are taken as the respective reasons; and the remain­ing [phrases] are taken as the respective distinctive features of these theses. That these three reasons themselves are established was established in the first verse [1.79] through two reasons each. In detail, this is just as above.

How or through what are these to be known?” They are to be understood [through the verse that starts with] “Here, through two phrases, again two, two, and two, in due order, one should understand...” The explanation of the meaning of this is as above.This applies to all three [explanations above—the brief introduction, the detailed explanation and] the distinct explanation. If applied to the [brief] introduction, “Here, through two phrases” [means that] the dharmakaya is to be understood as permanent through two [phrases]—the one phrase “character does not change into anything other” and the one phrase “be­cause it has the nature of being inexhaustible.” “Again two” [means that] the dharmakaya is to be understood as everlasting through two [phrases] — the one phrase “is the refuge of beings” and the one phrase “because it has no end in time.” “Two” [means that] the dharmakaya is to be understood as peaceful through two [phrases]—the one phrase “is always nondual” and the one phrase “because it is nonconceptual.” “And two” [means that] the dharmakaya is to be understood as eternal through two [phrases]—the one phrase “has the nature of indestructibility” and the one phrase “because its nature is to be uncreated.”Now this is explained for the [detailed] explanation. The dharmakaya is to be understood [as permanent]2184 through two [phrases]—the one phrase “is not born” and the one phrase “because it is permanent.”2185 The same applies for the other three [reasonings] too.Now, if this is applied to the distinct explanation, the dharmakaya is to be understood as permanent through two [phrases]—the one phrase “it is not born” and the one phrase “[in the form] of a body of a mental nature.” The same applies to the other three [reasonings] too.2186 Now [follows:]"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 5912.2.2.2.I.2.2.2.2.7.2.3.3.

[In response] to that concern, the two verses [beginning with] “The meaning of being perm anent is its character of not changing into anything other” provide the explanation that matches [these explanations] with [certain] scriptural passages on the tathágata heart. These two [verses here] are said to represent the words of those scriptural passages themselves.2188 The explanation of those scriptural passages through [another] scriptural passage is represented by [R G W s quote from the AnunatvápúrnatvanirdešasUtra] which says: “‘Šariputra ...'”This concludes the explanation [of the topic] of changelessness.2.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.8.

The negative thesis is that the nirvana without any remainder of the skandhas does not exist in what is apart from that [buddhahood].2190 “W hat kind of nirvána is that?” It is the nirvána that is endowed with four qualities. The above [two sentences] represent the actual thesis, and this [latter sentence] represents the distinctive feature of that thesis. “For what reason or argument [does] it [have these qualities]?” This is because the four [qualities in the phrase] “since it is the dharmakaya, the Tathagata, the reality of the noble ones, and ultimate nirvána“ {489} are included in the tathágata heart. “W hat is the example?” The example is “just like the sun and its rays.”2.2.2.2.I.2.2.2.2.8.2.

[Explanation of] the meaning of the first half of this verseIn brief, one should know the fourSynonyms such as the dharmakáyaFor the uncontam inated expanseSince it is classified as fourfold in meaning. 1.87[They] are the inseparability of the buddha attributes,The disposition for that having been obtained just as it is,Its true nature’s being without falsity and w ithout deception,And its being natural prim ordial peace. 1.88This has two parts. The root text of the first verse and its commentary represent the establishment of the names for the tathágata heart that are its four qualities, which are based on four different specific isolates that are the reasons for applying these terms. The root text of the second verse and its commentary represent the instruction on the essence of the reasons for applying these names.The root text has four parts. “W hat is the reason for labeling the tathágata heart as dharmakáya?” It is [the phrase] “the inseparability of the buddha attributes.” Buddhahood is the dharmakáya, and “dharm a” refers to its qualities. “Inseparability” refers to the qualities of the dharmakáya and the"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 593tathagata heart’s being inseparable. It is based on merely this reason that the tathàgata heart is labeled with the name “dharmakaya.”“W hat is the reason for labeling the tathagata heart with the name ‘Tathagata’?” It is [the phrase] “the disposition for that having been ob­tained just as it is.” “That” refers to buddhahood.2191 As for “having been obtained just as it is,” the buddha disposition functions as the cause for obtaining the aspect of the inconceivable lack of contamination and for obtaining inconceivable wisdom. It is based on merely this reason that the tathagata heart is labeled with the conventional expression “Tathagata.” “W hat is the reason for labeling the tathagata heart with the name ‘the ultimate reality of the noble ones’?” It is [the phrase] “its true nature’s be­ing without falsity and w ithout deception.” The seeming is false and de­ceptive, and what lacks these two is the ultimate. It is based on merely this reason that the tathàgata heart is labeled with the conventional expression “the ultimate reality of the noble ones.”“W hat is the reason for labeling the tathagata heart with the name ‘nat­ural nirvána’?” It is [the phrase] “its being natural prim ordial peace.” “Pri­mordial” [means] from the start. “Natural peace” [means] suffering being at peace because2192 it is without arising and ceasing. It is based on [merely this] reason that the tathàgata heart is labeled with the conventional expres­sion “nirvána.”The commentary has two parts. The explanation of just the meaning of the root text accords with the very meaning of the words [explained above]. Matching this with the scriptures has two parts: the explicit scrip­tural passage and the indirect scriptural passages. Since the explicit scrip­tural passage teaches explicitly that the tathàgata heart and the dharmakàya are not different, it is called “the explicit scriptural passage,” {490} which consists of [R G W ’s quoting the Anünatväpürnatvanirdesaparivarta] “For [the sütras] say the following: ‘Sàriputra, “tathàgata heart” is a designation for the dharmakàya.’”From among the three indirect scriptural passages [from the Srïmâlâdevïsütra], the scriptural passage of the tathàgata heart and the Tathàgata’s not being different is “Bhagavan, it is not that the tathàgata is other and . . You may wonder, “This sütra passage presents itself as a scriptural passage of the Tathàgata and the dharmakàya s not being dif­ferent, so how does it become a scriptural passage of the tathàgata heart and the Tathàgata’s not being different?” The instruction in this sütra [pas­sage] that the Tathàgata and the dharmakàya are not different amounts to one’s own tathàgata heart and the Tathàgata’s not being different because"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"594 Translationsit is taught in the above sütra [passage from the Anünatvápürnatvanir- desaparivarta] that the tathágata heart and the dharmakáya are not differ­ent.

Now, the scriptural passage of the tathágata heart and the ultimate reality of the noble ones not being different is “Bhagavan, the name cessation of suffering ...” The cessation of suffering and the ultimate reality2193 of the noble ones are synonyms.

Instruction on the essences of the four qualities3. Instruction on the causes that accomplish the four qualities4. Concluding summarizing instruction2195 on sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas lacking nirvana](1) As for the first point, it may be said, “Maitreya, your instruction that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas lack nirvana because they do not attain the dharmakaya and the explanations in the scriptures that these two [kinds of persons] possess nirvana are contradictory.” To that, [Maitreya would answer,] “There is no contradiction. My explanation that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas lack nirvana is the explanation that brings out the aspect of the definitive meaning, while the scriptures [that bring out] the aspect of their possessing [nirvana] are of expedient meaning.” “Through what does one know that they are of expedient meaning?” It is explained that this is known through the two passages from the Srîmâlâdevïsütra [in RGVV]. [This consists of RGVVs passage] “With regard to the parinirvâna of arhats and ...,” which consists of the actual [two] sütra [passages] and the two explanations of these [passages].(2) Now [follows] the explanation of the essences of the [four] qualities. Having in mind that “the qualities that consist of all aspects” in the root text are difficult [to understand], [the following] five verses explain the exam­ple of the painters. That the remaining three [qualities] are not explained [by the root text] after2196 [merely being listed] in the first [verse of the] root text represents the intention of the root text. [As for explaining “the qualities that consist of all aspects,” RGVV s phrase] “because they have accomplished the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects” re­fers to the prajna of realizing emptiness that is embraced by the means that consist of the six paramitas. You may wonder, “W hat is this emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects [mentioned] in the Ratnacüdapari- prcchâsütraV* It is like [that sùtra] says in detail:It lacks incompleteness of generosity, lacks incompleteness of discipline,lacks incompleteness of patience, lacks incompleteness of vigor, lacksincompleteness of dhyàna, and lacks incompleteness of means .. .2197"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 597Since the five verses [on the example of the painters] are easy [to under­stand], the commentary2198 does not comment [on them].2199 [However,] since the root text lacks an explanation of the latter three qualities in the first [verse of the] root text, [the commentary] provides comments on these [qualities]. Here, the explanation of innumerable qualities consists of R G W s passage “Here, each one among these [aspects] (generosity and so on)...” The explanation of inconceivable qualities consists of [the sen­tence] “[Also,] they are inconceivable by virtue of their number and power.” You may wonder, “W hat is the difference between these two?” The immea­surable divisions that are present within each one of the six paramitas that exist on the buddhabhumi represent innumerable [qualities]. These very [qualities also] represent inconceivable qualities because they cannot be conceived by the minds of sravakas and so on. The explanation of stainless qualities refers to [the sentence] “They are supremely pure .. .”2200(3) Now, you may wonder, “W hat are the causes that accomplish these four qualities?” To explain this, {492} [R G W says,] “Here, the true nature of nonarising is attained through having cultivated the door .. .”2201 This is just a [brief] indication of the meaning of the four causes.(4) Now, the conclusion by way of teaching that ¿ravakas and pratyeka­buddhas lack nirvana consists of [R G W ’s passage] “Since arhats and pratyekabuddhas lack...” The words [“these four kinds of wisdom” in this passage] refer to the four [kinds of wisdom] of the eighth [bhumi] and so on.

The dharmakaya is twofold—the stain­less dharmakaya and the dharmakaya that is its natural outflow. The [lat­ter] is twofold—the profound dharmakaya and the vast dharmakaya.

Therefore, there follows the flaw of the ex­amples and their meanings’ not corresponding.” [In response] to that, it is said that the latencies of desire [generally] obscure all purified phenomena without any one’s being the primary one, but what they primarily obscure is only the stainless dharmakaya. The latencies of hatred primarily obscure only the profound dharmakaya. The others are to be understood in the same way. Since the reasons for being primary and not primary are [somewhat] arbitrary, one should consider the following. About this, Ngog [Lotsáwa] says that the examples and their meanings are not presented by virtue of the meaning that the factors to be obscured and the factors that obscure them are certain, such that a certain purified phenomenon to be obscured is obscured by only a certain obscuration. Rather, the examples and their meanings are presented by virtue of there being similarities between the ex­amples and their meanings in terms of the nine afflicted phenomena to be illustrated and the nine examples that illustrate them as well as there being similarities between the examples and their meanings in terms of the nine purified phenomena to be illustrated and the nine examples that illustrate them. Therefore, there is no flaw of the examples and their meanings’ not corresponding.2202 This is an explanation without wrongdoing.(3b) As for determining whether the meanings [of the nine afflicted phe­nomena] differ among each other, {494} it may be asked, “Are these nine af­flicted phenomena the same in essence or different?” In being the latencies of desire and so on, they are different in essence. They are also different in support— [Uttaratantra 1.136] says:Through these stains, naive beings,Arhats, learners, and the intelligentAre [explained] to be impure in due orderThrough four, one, two, and two, respectively."},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 601It may be said, “But in that case, since the afflictions to be relinquished through familiarization, the stains pertaining to the pure bhumis, and the stains pertaining to the impure bhumis are [all] factors to be relinquished through familiarization, what difference is there between them?” From the point of view of bodhisattvas, there is no difference. [But] here, the factors to be relinquished through familiarization are those that exist in mere noble learners, thus being explained from the point of view of the factors to be relinquished that are common [to sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas]. However, the stains pertaining to the impure bhumis and the stains pertaining to the pure bhumis [are explained] in terms of the uncommon factors to be relinquished by bodhisattvas because the sravakas themselves lack these very bhumis as factors to be obscured.It may be asked, “Are the nine purified phenomena the same in essence or different?” There is no difference in their essence—all represent the na­ture of phenomena. [However,] their phases are different in that there are differences between [them in terms of the nature of phenomena] being clearly manifest or not being clearly manifest.

The similarities between the examples and their meanings(la) The essence of the dharmakáyaThe dharmakáya is to be known as twofold—The utterly stainless dharm adhätuAnd its natural outflow (teachingThe principles of profundity and diversity). 1.148This [essence of the dharmakáya] consists of [R G W ’s passage] “Here, what is the dharmakaya? . . .” The stainless dharmakáya is the actual dharmakáya—suchness endowed with twofold purity. The dharmakáya that is its natural outflow consists of the two rüpakäyas. {497} You may wonder, “Why is it called ‘its natural outflow’?” The two rüpakäyas explain the dharma of the mahäyäna, and the dharmakáya will be attained through studying, reflecting, and meditating on this [dharma]. Since this serves as the cause that is the concordant cause of the dharmakáya, it is called the “concordant cause.” Such is the intention of the commentary because it explains that it is “the cause for attaining this [dharmakáya].” From a certain [other] perspective, by virtue of a buddha himself attaining the dharmakáya, it happens that [this dharmakáya] appears as the two rüpakäyas for his retinues. Therefore, since [these rüpakàyas] represent the result that is concordant with the cause that is the dharmakáya, there is no flaw if one says that [the dharmakáya] itself is the kàya that is a concordant cause.2218 “What subject matters do the2219 [rüpakäyas] teach?” In terms of ultimate reality, “profundity” refers to their teaching profound emptiness to bodhisattvas.

Just as a tree grows through water, manure, and so on, the unfolding disposition represents the arising of proper mental engagement such as studying. Just as a precious statue is not produced now and all kinds of needed and desired things arise if it is supplicated, the dharmakaya too is unproduced by causes and conditions and is a treasure of qualities such as the powers arising.

The explanation of this [scriptural passage] through the sütras con­sists of [R G W s following four quotes from] the Srïmâlâdevïsütra. It may"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"6i6 Translationsbe said, “In the abhidharma treatises, this verse from the Abhidharmasutra appears as a scriptural passage to establish the alaya,2222 but here it appears as a scriptural passage to establish the disposition. So are the alaya and the disposition the same?” Guru Parahita asserts:They are the same—the naturally abiding alaya and the naturally abid­ing disposition are the same, and the adventitious alaya and the unfold­ing disposition are the same.Some say, “They are not asserted as the same because the alaya is the basis of contaminated phenomena, whereas the disposition is the basis of the uncontaminated seeds.” Such is not the case—if [the alaya] did not function as the basis of uncontaminated phenomena, it would not be the alaya2223 because it would function [only] as the basis of one part [of all phenomena]. “But if the alaya functions as the basis of uncontaminated2224 or purified phenomena too, this contradicts the following explanation in the Mahayanasamgraha, the [Pancaskandhaprakaranajvaibhasya, and the M adhyantavibhagatika: ‘“W hy is it called ‘alaya[-consciousness]'?”2225 It is called “alaya[-consciousness]” because all afflicted phenomena that entail arising adhere to it as being its results and it adheres to them as being their cause.'”2226 The author2227 of the [Vivrta]gudhdrtha[pindavydkhyd] says that this is without flaw: the uncontaminated seeds exist in the alaya, but they do not exist substantially—they are not able to directly produce manifest un­contaminated results. They are not the primary [seeds in the alaya], that is, they represent a minority [in it]. Therefore, [the Mahdyanasamgraha] does not explain that [the alaya] functions as the basis of purified phenomena. [By contrast,] the contaminated seeds [in the alaya] do exist substantially— they are able to produce manifest contaminated results. They are the pri­mary [seeds in the alaya], that is, they represent its majority. Therefore, [the Mahdyanasamgraha] explains [the alaya] as the alaya because it functions as the basis of afflicted phenomena.2228 “But in that case, it is contradictory that the seeds of both afflicted phenomena and purified phenomena dwell in the single alaya.” There is no contradiction—the author of the [Vivrta]- gudhdrtha[pindavyakhya] says that this is like water and milk abiding together in a single metal bowl as their basis.2229 “But with the seeds of af­flicted phenomena and purified phenomena abiding equally in the alaya, it is contradictory that the seeds of afflicted phenomena decrease and the seeds of purified phenomena increase through cultivating the remedy that is the path.” There is no contradiction in this—the author of the [Vivrta]-"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 617gudhdrtha[pindavyakhyd] says that this is like geese who have a beak [able to extract] the essence separating water from milk with their beak [able to extract] the essence.2230 Therefore, the Madhyantavibhagatika explains that the virtues conducive to liberation {499} overcome the power [of the aris­ing] of samsara while the virtues conducive to penetration give rise to the power [of the arising] of uncontaminated phenomena.2231“Venerable [Maitreya] asserts that the essence of the disposition is the nature of phenomena. If the nature of phenomena is what purifies the obscurations through [someones] focusing on it, how could it be justified that it functions as the basis2232 of afflicted phenomena?” This is without flaw—until one focuses on the naturally abiding alaya through the rem ­edy that is the path, the seeds of afflicted phenomena exist [in it] in the manner of adventitious stains. Once one focuses on it through the remedy that is the path, these stains are purified. Therefore, in the manner of wis­dom’s being uninterrupted in the uncontaminated seeds, there is no inter­ruption [in them].2233 “Well, the disposition is the nature of phenomena, but is there2234 an explanation of it as the uncontaminated seeds?” There is [such an explanation]—in the above context of the basic element’s be­ing presented as a substantial cause, [RGVV] first explains that it “is the seed of the supramundane attributes.”2235 Thus, since the disposition and the alaya are the same, this commentary [RGVV] discusses this in detail. The seven phrases2236 from the Srimdladevisutra mentioned [above] explain that if [the disposition] were momentary and did not remain, weariness of samsara and wishing for nirvana and so on would not arise. Therefore, it teaches that [weariness and so on] arise in the alaya. This shall suffice as an analysis here.[All this further] explains [line I.28c] “And since the disposition exists...” [that was already commented on] in the context of commenting on the intention of the scriptures about the basic element.

The essence or defining characteristics of the basic element’s being free from the pair of superimposition and denialThere is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated. 1.157The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,W hich has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,W hich have the characteristic of being inseparable. 1.158You may wonder, “Who is it that superimposes [something] onto the basic element or denies [something about it] ?” It is the srâvakas who superimpose by saying, “The afflictions exist in the dharmadhâtu since the beginning” and deny by saying, “The qualities of the dharmakàya do not exist from the beginning [but] arise later.”You may wonder, “How do these two verses teach that [the basic ele­ment] is free from the pair of superimposition and denial?” This [is ex­plained through] the subject, the thesis, and the reason [of two reasonings], as well as the elimination of a disputational flaw. As for “in this,” the subject is “in this basic element that exists at all times, exists in all sentient beings (the objects), {500} and exists in a manner that is without difference.” The thesis is “there is nothing to be removed.” “Why?” The reason is “because the basic element is empty of what is adventitious, which has the char­acteristic of being separable.” [As for the second reasoning,] the subject applies again in the same way, and the thesis is “there is not the slightest to be added.”2238 “Why?” The reason is “[because] it is not empty of the"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 619unsurpassable attributes, which have the characteristic of being insepa­rable.” It may be asked, “In that case, how is it posited that the fruition of liberation is attained through relinquishing the afflictions and attaining the qualities of the dharmakaya? If there are no afflictions to be relinquished and no qualities of the dharmakaya to be attained at present, it follows that there is no fruition of liberation [later either].” There is no such flaw—this disputational flaw is eliminated by [the line] “Actual reality is viewed as it really is—if actual reality is seen, one is liberated.”The commentary has three points. (1) The instruction on the defining characteristics or the essence of the basic element that is free from the two extremes consists of [RGVV s passage] “W hat is taught by this? . . . free from the extremes of superimposition and denial.”(2) The second point is to establish that this basic element is not an ob­ject of the thinking of the four, [kinds of] persons, which is [first] estab­lished through reasoning. (2a) As for establishing it through reasoning, it is [first] established that [the basic element] is not an object of persons whose minds are distracted from emptiness, which consists of [R G W ’s] passage “Here, those whose minds are distracted from and stray outside of...” [The phrase] “those whose minds are distracted outside” teaches that [the basic element] is not an object of those persons who have views about emptiness and are full of pride [about that]. [The phrase] “those who stray” teaches that [the basic element] is not an object of the Sautrantikas, who assert that the five appropriating skandhas exist from the beginning and become totally nonexistent later, thus denying [something about] the fruition. [The phrase] “those who do not cultivate it in samadhi” teaches that it is not an object of the Mere Mentalists who assert a self-awareness empty of appre- hender and apprehended as the ultimate and contrasts it to “the wisdom of ultimate emptiness” below. The summary of these three [persons] consists of [the phrase] “those who are not one-pointed [with regard to it].” The instruction that [the basic element] is not an object of sravakas, pratyeka­buddhas, and ordinary beings consists of [the sentence] “W ithout being introduced to the wisdom of ultimate emptiness ...”(2b) Establishing [that the basic element is not an object of the think­ing of four kinds of persons] through scripture consists of [the passage] “With this in mind, it is said . . .” Here, it is said that [this passage from] the [Srimaladevi] sutra explicitly teaches that [the basic element] is not an object of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, with [the word] “any” [in it implicitly] teaching that it is not an object of ordinary beings and those"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"620 Translations[bodhisattvas] whose minds are distracted from emptiness [either] because this appears in [R G W s] explanation of this sutra [passage],(3) The third point is the explanation of the instruction that the dhar­makaya is [only] a bit of an object for bodhisattvas dwelling on the ten bhumis, which is connected [to the previous passage] as follows. {501} You may wonder, “If this basic element that possesses such defining character­istics is not an object of these four [kinds of] persons, the object of which persons is it?” [In response] to that, in order to teach that bodhisattvas on the ten bhumis do not2239 see it in a complete manner, while buddhas see it in a pure manner, [RGVV says,] “Here, to have realized the introduction to the wisdom ...”2.2.2.2.I.6.

(l)-(2) “Spoken of as luminous by nature” refers to the object of nonconceptual wisdom—since what realizes this2250 is wisdom, this is an explanation through pointing to the subject by way of its object. “The sun” is the example for this wisdom in that it is similar to clearly cognizing all mountains and valleys through [the light of] the sun. “Having been obscured by the thick cloud banks of adventitious afflictive and cognitive [obscurations]... stainless” refers to relinquishment. As for the essence of the two obscurations, the afflictive obscurations represent the obstacles to the arising of the wisdoms of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas in dependence on the objects that consist of the four realities [of the noble ones]. The cognitive obscurations represent the obstacles to the arising of the nonconceptual wisdoms of buddhas and bodhisattvas in dependence on the objects that consist of the five fields of knowledge. “Stainless” refers to the relinquishment of these [two] including their latent tendencies. “Just as the sky” is the example for relinquishment, which means that it resembles the sky endowed with twofold purity.

Explanation of the actual qualitiesThe fifteen [qualities] are explained to be inconceivable qualities through three verses.Buddhahood is the object of om niscient wisdom [alone].Since it is not the object of the three wisdoms,It is to be understood as being inconceivable [Even] by those with the body of wisdom. 11.31Since it is subtle, it is not an object of study.Since it is the ultimate, it is not [an object] of reflection.Since it is the profound nature of phenomena,It is not an object of worldly m editation and so forth. 11.32For naive beings have never seen it before,Just as those born blind [have never seen] form.Even noble ones [see it only] as an infant [would glimpse]The form of the sun [from] within the house of its birth. 11.33[The reasoning in the first verse] has five2260 parts—subject, thesis, reason, explanation of the reason, and teaching the example for not realizing2261 [buddhahood]. [The line] “buddhahood, the object of omniscient wisdom [alone]” is the subject. [The two lines] “is to be understood as being inconceivable [even] by those with the body of wisdom” are the thesis. [The line] “since it is not the object of the three wisdoms” is the reason. Then,2262 one verse is the explanation of the reason. Then, one verse [teaches] the example. As for the example, those born blind2263 have not seen form in this life before, nor do they see form now. Likewise, ordinary beings have not seen the nature of phenomena before, nor do they see it now. An infant immediately after birth does not see2264 the sun—when lying in the house, it does not see the actual sun [but only] sees the light of the sun that shines from stars and planets [as a reflection]. Likewise, ¿ravakas see only personal identitylessness [but] do not see phenomenal identitylessness. In addition to that, pratyekabuddhas see only the lack of nature of the apprehended [but] do not see the lack of nature2265 of the apprehender.

These are matched with the five phrases [of this verse] in due order.Then, one verse teaches the five characteristics of the sambhogakaya:Through bodies endowed with all kinds of light rays of the genuine dharma,It makes efforts in accomplishing the goal of liberating beings,In its actions resembling the king of wish-fulfilling jewels [In assuming] various entities but not having their nature. 11.40[The phrase] “all kinds of the genuine dharm a” refers to the characteristic of the verbal discourse [of the sambhogakaya] being uninterrupted. [The phrase] “bodies endowed with light rays” refers to the characteristic of its physical appearances being uninterrupted. Then, in due order, the following three lines teach the characteristic of its activity’s being uninterrupted, the characteristic of its activity’s being nonconceptual, and the characteristic of appearing as various [entities] but not having the nature of these various [entities].Then, half a verse teaches the characteristics of the nirmanakaya: {507}The causal form in [various] worlds that introduces [beings]To the path of peace, matures them, and gives them the propheciesII.41ab[The phrase] “in [various] worlds that introduces [beings] to the path2268 of peace” refers to establishing [beings] in [the fruitions] such as stream- enterer through turning the wheel of the dharma of the four realities [ofA Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 637"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"638 Translationsthe noble ones].

(1) As for the basis of the division, the single buddhahood is described in the sütras by seven synonyms. It is called “self-arisen” because it is not produced by causes and conditions. It is called “omniscience” since it knows everything"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 639to be known in one instant. It is called “buddhahood”2269 because the two sleeplike obscurations have been relinquished and wisdom has unfolded toward everything to be known. It is called “highest nirvana” since it lacks such as the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance that exists in the mind streams of bodhisattvas. It is called “inconceivable” since it is inconceivable by the minds of árávakas and so on. It is called “great arhat” because the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies, have been overcome. It is called “the personal character” since it is to be personally experienced by nonconceptual wisdom. Thus, it is divided [like that].(2) The points of the division are three—profundity (the dharmakaya), vastness (the sambhogakáya), and m agnanimity (the nirmánakáya). (3) The reason for the division consists of [these káyas] being “characterized by the attributes that are the qualities,” which correspond to the brief introduction to these qualities [above]. (4) The conclusion consists of “its manifestation through three káyas, such as the svábhávika[káya].” “Svábhávika” refers to the dharmakáya. “Such as” includes the remaining two káyas.2.2.2.2.2.2.5.2.2. Explanation of the individual characteristics of the three káyasAmong the three parts of this, (1) the explanation of the dharmakàya is [as follows]:Here, the svâbhàvikakàyaO f the buddhas with five characteristicsIs to be understood, in brief,As being endowed with five qualities. 11.44It is unconditioned, undifferentiable,Free from the two extremes,And liberated from the three obscurations—Afflictive, cognitive, and those of meditative absorption. 11.45Because of being stainless, being nonconceptual,And being the object of yogins,It is luminous since it is pureBy virtue of having the nature of the dharm adhâtu. 11.46The svàbhàvikakàya is endowed W ith the qualities of being"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"640 TranslationsImmeasurable, innumerable, inconceivable,Unequaled, and having reached the perfection of purity. 11.47Because of being vast, because of not being enumerable,Because of not being an object of dialecticians,And because of being absolutely unique and having relinquished [all] latent tendencies,It is, in due order, immeasurable and so on. 11.48Among these five verses, [the dharmakaya] is [briefly] introduced through the first verse [that begins with] “Here, the svabhavikakaya.” The remaining four [verses] are its [detailed] explanation. Among them, the first two verses explain its characteristics. Then, two verses explain its qualities. Among them, the first verse [11.47] functions as the thesis, while the second one {508} matches [the elements of the thesis] with their justifications. This matching corresponds to the labels in the context of the conventional terms of the five characteristics and the five qualities [of the dharmakaya] being explained through the brief introduction [above].(2) Now, the characteristics of the sambhogakaya are explained through four verses:Because of enjoying all kinds of dharm a And appearing [through its] natural attributes,Because of the natural outflow of pure compassion’s Being the uninterrupted welfare of beings, 11.49Because of fulfilling [all aims] as wished In a nonconceptual and effortless manner,And because of [resembling] the miraculous power of a wish- fiilfilling jewel,The sambhogafkaya] abides. 11.50In terms of discourse, display,U ninterrupted activity, effortlessness,And not exhibiting the nature of these,Variety is described here as being fivefold. 11.51Just as, due to various colors,A jewel appears not in its actual state,"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 641So, due to the variety of conditions of [different] beings,The all-pervading lord appears not in his actual state. 11.52[The line] “because of enjoying all kinds of dharm a” refers to the characteristic of the verbal discourse [of the sambhogakaya] being uninterrupted. Then, one line of verse refers to the characteristic of its physical appearances’ being uninterrupted. Next, two lines of verse refer to its activity’s being uninterrupted. Then, one verse refers to the characteristic of its activity’s being nonconceptual. Next, one verse refers to the characteristic of its appearing as various [entities] but not having the nature of these various [entities]. Then, one verses teaches an example for this last characteristic.(3) Next, the characteristics of the nirmanakaya are explained:W ith great compassion, the knower of the world Beholds the world in its entirety.W ithout moving away from the dharmakaya A nd through various em anated natures, 11.53He is born in [his previous] births,Descends from Tusita,Enters the womb [of his mother], is born,Becomes skilled in the field of arts and crafts, 11.54Enjoys entertainments in the circle of his queens,Renounces [all of it], practices asceticism,Reaches the seat of awakening,Vanquishes the armies of Mara, 11.55Becomes completely awakened, [turns] the wheel of dharma,And passes into nirvana.

III.6As for “what is the case and what is not the case,” through knowing2273 what is the case and what is not the case, [one knows] that it is the case, that it represents the cause, that there is the chance, and that it is possible that higher realms and liberation are attained through the ten virtues and that it does not represent the cause, that it is not the case, that there is no chance, and that it is impossible that the three lower realms are attained [through them ]. The same as above applies to it being the case that the lower realms are attained through the ten nonvirtues [and so on]. (2) “M aturation of karm as” refers to knowing the maturation of [all] karmas, that is, knowing the maturation of virtue and nonvirtue. Therefore, the above is the knowledge of the [karmic] causes, while the following one is the knowledge of the results [of these causes]. (3) “Faculties” refers to knowing [higher] faculties [and those] that are not higher.

(7) “Afflicted and stainless dhyanas and so on” refers to knowing afflicted phenomena and purified phenomena. (8) “Recollection of [former birth] places” refers to the knowledge of recollecting former [birth] places. (9) “The divine eye” refers to knowing the transitions, deaths, and rebirths [of all beings]. (10) “Peace” {510} refers to the power of knowing the termination of contamination.2274 The function of these ten powers is to vanquish the four maras, which applies [here] as it is explained in the M ahdydnasutrdlamkara 2275[In knowing] what is the case and what is not the case, m aturation, constitutions, the various inclinations of beings,W hat is afflicted and purified, the collection of faculties, recollection of form er [birth] places,The divine eye, and the mode of the term ination of contam ination, the powers are like a vajra Because they pierce the armor, break the firm wall, and cut down the tree of ignorance. III.7cd[It is said] that the omission of the power of knowing all kinds of karma in the context of the similarities between the examples and their meanings [means that] it is included in the power of knowing the term ination of contam ination (the fruition). As for these ten powers, when counting from the beginning of the actual explanation of the characteristics of the ten powers [above], the [first] six powers pierce the armor-like cognitive obscurations, the following three break the obscurations of meditative absorption, which are like a firm wall, and the last power overcomes the treelike afflictive obscurations “because it cuts them down.”(2) As for the [four] fearlessnesses, the first verse represents the [brief] introduction:The four kinds of fearlessness are with regard to The complete realization of all phenomena,The stopping of [all] obstacles,Teaching the path, and teaching cessation.

When applied to the example, a lion is well poised because he is never frightened of anybody. He is independent because he does not depend on other animals. He is firm because there is no primary inhabitant [of his territory above him]. He dwells endowed with power because there is no one else stronger than him. To apply this to the meaning, it is the explanation in the nine lines of the verse following [line III.32c] “the lion of sages resembles a lion” in the section on the summarized meaning through examples [below] to which [the example] here applies.2276(3) As for the explanation of the [eighteen] unique [qualities], the first three verses represent the detailed explanation:The teacher is without mistakenness and chatter,Lacks deterioration of mindfulness,Lacks a m ind not resting in meditative equipoise,Lacks all kinds of discriminating notions, III.l 1Lacks indifference without examination,Lacks deterioration of striving, vigor,Mindfulness, prajna, liberation,"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"650 TranslationsHis actions are preceded by wisdom,And his wisdom is unobscured with regard to time.Thus, these eighteen are the teacher’s qualitiesThat are unique compared to others. 111.13The two verses following that teach them in a summarized manner:The seer lacks mistakenness, chatter, mindlessness, m ental agitation,Notions of difference, and natural indifference.

III.28The remaining [verses] represent the [detailed] explanation. This explanation has four points:(1) Determining the meaning of the example of a vajraAmong the powers and so on, through six powers,Three, and one, in due order,All [stains] in terms of what is to be cognized, meditative absorption, And [the afflictions] including their latent tendencies are eliminated.111.29Therefore, since these [three stains] are pierced, broken, and cut down Like an armor, a wall, and a tree, respectively, III.30ab“Through six powers” [means] through the six counted from the beginning of the actual explanation of the characteristics of the ten powers above since they pierce the armor-like cognitive obscurations. The wall-like obscurations of meditative absorption are broken through the three powers after those [six]. The treelike afflictive obscurations including their latent tendencies are gradually cut down through the last power.You may wonder, “W hy do the ten powers function like that?” The [brief] introduction [to this is taught] through half a verse and its detailed explanation through one verse:The powers of the seer are like a vajraDue to being steady, firm, strong, and unbreakable. 111.30W hy are they steady?

Because they are unbreakable.Since they are unbreakable, they are like a vajra. 111.31(2) As for determining the meaning of the example of a lion, the first three lines of verse [that begin with] “Because of being unafraid, because of being indifferent” represent the [brief] introduction:Because of being unafraid, because of being indifferent,Because of being firm, and because of being supremely powerful,The lion of sages resembles a lion, III.32acThe explanation of the meaning through [the following] nine lines of verse is only pointed to [here]:Being fearless amid the assemblies of his retinue.

The five examples are the four elements and space as the fifth one.(3b) Establishing the similarity between the example and its meaning has two parts: [teaching] the example of being similar in terms of just one aspect and teaching the example of not being similar (or, the example of not being unique and the example of being unique). The first half of the verse represents the example of being similar or not being unique. Just as the supports that consist of the four elements and space as the fifth one [equally] function as the sustaining causes for sentient beings, both the four, such as ordinary beings, and buddhas are in accord in terms of qualities such as the supernatural knowledges. The latter half of the verse represents the example of not being similar or being unique. “The m undane” are the ordinary beings of the higher realms. “The supram undane” are sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. Buddhas transcend the characteristics of these [persons]—the eighteen unique qualities exist only in buddhas and do not exist in others. As an example, “they resemble space”—[the quality of] being free from [any] tangible object that obstructs exists only in space {512} and does not exist in the other [elements].You may wonder, “On what2284 are these thirty-two qualities of freedom based?” They are based on the dharmakaya because it is taught that “they are not different from the dharmakaya.” [This is taught in] the one2285 verse [beginning with] “These thirty-two qualities.”These thirty-two qualities Make up the dharmakayaBecause they are undifferentiable [from it], just as its radiance,Color, and shape are [inseparable from] a precious jewel.

If he promotes the welfare of sentient beings, this contradicts his not having thoughts. The meaning of [the response] to this is that the doubts of those to be guided are cut through by virtue of teaching the nine examples of there being no contradiction between being unconditioned and having arising and ceasing as well as between not having thoughts and promoting the welfare of sentient beings.The ultimate purpose is taught by the three verses after that:The purpose of this is taughtBy the very name of the sutra collection"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Meaning of the Words 677In which these nine examples Are taught in detail.

This has two parts: (1) [brief] introduction and (2) [de­tailed] explanation. (1) [The brief introduction] consists of two verses:The display, the instruction, the all-pervasiveness,The emanation, the radiance of wisdom,The secrets of body, speech, and mind,And the attainm ent of those whose character is compassion.

Therefore, among them, [the example of] the earth is the best, so the earth resembles the Tathagata [and his enlightened activity the most]. Since the Tathagata represents the ultimate relinquishment and wisdom, it is taught [in the detailed explanation below that just as the earth is the ground for everything,] the Buddha is the foundation of all mundane and supramundane qualities. Consequently, in order to teach that [he and his enlightened activity] are more eminent than ¿ravakas and pratyekabuddhas, [the examples] are taught in this way. Hence, [this verse] says: “In this order by way of the latter ones eliminating the dissimilarities2320 of the former.” This means that since each latter example teaches a better similarity [to enlightened activity] than the former, [this activity of] the Buddha is taught to be better [than each preceding example] by way of relinquishing [all] the former examples of [this activity of] the Buddha2321 [that match it only partially].[2.2.2.2.4.3.2.6.2.

Buddhahood is like Sakra’s reflection. “Does it resemble [buddhahood] in every respect?” It is dissimilar in that the reflection of Sakra is not endowed with a voice that speaks the dharma. Therefore, it is stated that buddhahood is better than this example. You may say, “Since the explanation of the dharma arises from the drum [of the gods, buddhahood] is similar to that golden drum [of the gods].” [The phrase] “it is like the drum of the gods” teaches that this latter example is better than the former one. {518} “Does it resemble [buddhahood] in every respect?” That drum is dissimilar in that the golden drum does not prom ote the welfare [of beings] at every time.

(1) The means to protect oneself from abandoning the mahayana dharma consists of the one verse [that begins with,] “In this world”:In this world, there is no one wiser than the victor,No other one who properly knows supreme true reality in its entirety through his omniscience.Therefore, one should not mix up the sutra collections presented by the seer himself.Since this destroys the m anner of the sage, it will also harm the genuine dharma.

V.22Here, the causes for deviating [from the mahayana dharma] are eight. (1) “W eak intelligence” refers to little prajna. (2) “Lacking faith in what is pure” refers to lacking the mahayana disposition. (3) “Relying on false pride” refers to adopting views of extinction and thus not seeking the true actuality from the learned. (4) [The phrases] “because of having the character of being obscured through being destitute of the genuine dharma, because of grasping at the expedient m eaning as being true reality” refer to having gathered the karma of being destitute of the dharma. Based on that, clinging to the expedient meaning as being the definitive meaning occurs. These two [phrases] are one cause. (5) “Because of coveting gain”2332 is the fifth cause. (6) “Because of being under the sway of views” refers to having come under the sway of wrong views. This primarily refers to [mistaken] views. The above [phrase] “because of relying on false pride” primarily refers to pride. (7) “Because of relying on those who discredit the dharm a” refers to relying on evil companions. (8) “Because of keeping at a distance from those who m aintain the dharm a” refers to not relying on mahayana spiritual friends.

V.24[The phrase] “will be swiftly liberated from these [actions], when they reflect on the nature of phenom ena” refers to [persons] like King Ajatasatru.2334 With something like King Ajatasatru s killing his father King Bimbisara (who was both his father and an arhat) happening, [two actions] without interval2335 took place. [Afterward, Ajatasatru] went to his root guru, noble Manjusri, and confessed his evil deeds.

Now [follows:]2.3. Explanation of the tasks of concluding the treatise in the end by the author of the commentaryThis has four parts: (1) the one who makes the dedication, (2) what is to be dedicated, (3) that from which what is to be dedicated arises, and (4) the dedication. (1) The “I”2341 as the one who makes the dedication refers to Asanga. (2) What is to be dedicated refers to “whatever inconceivable2342 merit I attained.” (3) That from which [the merit] that is to be dedicated arises refers to [the phrases] “the precious genuine dharma of the supreme yana” (the meaning of the root text) and “due to explaining” (having com­posed the commentary on this [root text] and so on). (4) The dedication consists of the latter half of the verse, [meaning,] “May [all beings] become vessels for realizing the subject matter of the Uttaratantra—the seven vajra points.”I, who am ignorant in that I just see this life, am not able to determine the vajra points and [thus] have presented the words ofM arpa Lotsawa., who drank the nectar stream of the speech o f guru Parahita.

Hence, I gave up the [self-]contempt o f thinking that I do not possess what it takes to compose [a commentary], so those with faith [are able to] make efforts [in studying this commentary on the Uttaratantra].

Therefore, I composed this treatise.Most small-minded people who just see this life are attached to ordinary philosophical systems and thus do not listen to the profound stream of the speech of the noble ones who clearly teach the excellent path of the supreme yana. Even if they listen to it a little bit, they are not able to fathom its profound intended meaning2344 and reject it [by saying], “This is of expedient meaning.” I am certainly not able to lead those biased [persons] onto the supreme excellent path of the powerful heart of the matter, but I give rise to the enthusiasm for composing this scriptural commentary in order to clearly remember it in my own mind.As for the dharma to be explained here, among the fivefold collection of the dharmas of Maitreya authored by the venerable protector Maitreya, the one that teaches the ultimate definitive meaning, the heart of the mat­ter, is the Mahdydnottaratantrasastra. After the abhidharma had come un­der attack three times in the central land of India, the teachings were in danger of vanishing. At that time, the bhiksuni *Praka£asIla2345 [gave birth to] noble Asanga, the son from her union with a [man from the] Ksatriya caste, and master Vasubandhu, the son from her union with a [man from the] Brahman caste. Through these two masters, the abhidharmas of the"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"The Heart of the Luminous Sun 697higher and lower yanas spread and flourished. Master Asanga, by virtue of having practiced for twelve years in a rock cave at Mount Kukkutapada in an area in southern India, {130} direcdy met venerable Maitreya. Based on Maitreya s miraculous powers, they arrived at the god realm Tusita. [There, Asanga] listened to the dharma [coming] from Maitreya s [mouth] for fifty hum an years.2346 Retaining the fivefold collection of the dharmas of Mai­treya in his mind, [Asanga] returned to Jambudvlpa and explained them in detail to his disciples, such as master Vasubandhu.[Asanga] composed many treatises such as the fivefold bhumi collection (the [Bahubhumijvastu of the bhumi collection, the Vijhaptiviniscayasam- grahanu the Vastusamgrahani, the Vivaranamukhasarngraham, and the Par- ydyasamgrahani)m7 and the two kinds of synopses (the Mahdydnasam- graha and the Abhidharmasamuccaya).2348 [Thus,] he made the mahayana teachings [radiate] like the sun shining at daybreak. Master Vasubandhu [also] authored [many] treatises that teach the mahayana, [called] “the eightfold prakarana collection.”2349 There were four of his disciples who were equal to himself in terms of being learned in the four great [sets of] teachings [of the Buddha]—Gunaprabha, who was equal to him in the vinaya, the Kashmiri Sthiramati, who was equal to him in the abhidharma, Aryavimuktisena, who was equal to him in prajnaparamita, and Dignaga, who was equal to him in valid cognition. They composed many treatises that comment on the intentions of these four great [sets of] teachings. By virtue of having been explained extensively to their disciples, [all these texts] spread and flourish to the present day. {131}Master Vasubandhu commented on the other dharmas of Maitreya, such as the Abhisamaydlamkdra.2350 [However,] having in mind that this Uttaratantra is not the sphere of the common yana and is very profound, Asanga composed a commentary [on it] himself. Thinking that this com­mentary does not fit into the [narrow] minds of most propounders of [Buddhist] philosophical systems, such as the faction of the sravakas, he concealed it for the time being as a treasure inside a stupa. At a later time, the mighty lord Maitrlpa, when circumambulating this stupa, saw light rays coming forth from a crack [in it]. Thinking, “W hat is in there?,” he looked [closer] and thus [was able to] extract a manuscript of the Uttaratantra to­gether with Asangas commentary. Seeing that the intention of this treatise was in conformity with the teachings on the heart of the matter2351 asserted by [his guru Savaripa], the mighty lord of mountain hermits, [Maitrlpa] felt very great faith [in it]. Wishing to listen to the reading transmission of this [text], he supplicated the regent Ajita. In the sky between the clouds,"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"698 Translationsvenerable Maitreya arrived, with a crystal stüpa as his crown ornament, and gave the reading transmission of the Uttaratantra. Then, lord Maitripa explained the Uttaratantra including Asangas commentary extensively to his disciples. [One of] Maitrlpa’s disciples, the pandita *Ànandakîrti, car­rying the manuscript of Asanga s commentary with him, went to the city Anupamapura in the Indian region of Kashmir and explained it to the mahâpandita Sajjana. The [latter] {132} explained it to both the translator Ngog Loden Sherab and Dsen Kawoché. After both of them had translated it into Tibetan, they spread it [in Tibet].Then, it was gradually transmitted further [until it came to] the pre­cious dharma lord Rangjung Dorje, who heard it from the dharma lord of Sangpu,2352 Jamyang §âkya Shônnu,2353 and composed a commentary that is a topical outline of the Uttaratantra and Asanga’s commentary. He taught it extensively to his disciples, such as Karma Gôncho Shônnu,2354 and thus spread it widely. He also explained the intention of shentong to the omni­scient Jonangpa.2355 By virtue of [that explanation], though certainty did not arise [in Dôlpopa] at first, extraordinary experiences and realizations were born [in him] later by virtue of having completed the six branches of application [of the Kàlacakratantra]. [The Karmapa thus] made him look at and realize the sütras of the final wheel [of dharma] and the trea­tises of definitive meaning, such as the Uttaratantra, including Asangas commentary. Through this, certainty in accordance with the assertions of the dharma lord Rangjung [Dorje] arose [in him], and he thus adopted the philosophical system of Shentong.

The phrase “is endowed with limitless peaceful and disci­plined assemblies of disciples” teaches the actuality of the jewel that is the samgha.

I.8abHere, buddhahood is unconditioned because its nature is to be without arising in the beginning, without abiding in the middle, and without perishing in the end. It is effortless because it is the utter peace of all conceptions and reference points entailing effort and yet is the kaya that is endowed with all buddhadharmas. {139} It is not realized through conditions such as the words of others because it is realized by personally experienced wisdom to be self-arisen. It is endowed with wisdom because it realizes those three aspects (being unconditioned and so on). It is endowed with compassion because it teaches others the path that makes them realize such a [buddhahood]. It is endowed with consummate power because, based on such wisdom and compassion, it relinquishes all suffering and afflictions of those to be guided.2.2.1.1.1.2.2. SummaryOne’s own welfare is by virtue of the first three qualities And the welfare of others, by virtue of the latter three. I.8cdBuddhahood represents the fulfillment of the two welfares—the fulfillment of ones own welfare and the fulfillment of the welfare of others. The fulfillment of one’s own welfare consists of [buddhahood’s] being unconditioned, [possessing] spontaneously present qualities, and being realized as self-arisen self-awareness. The fulfillment of the welfare of others consists of its being endowed with the three [qualities] of knowledge, loving-kindness, and power that accomplish the welfare of others.2.2.1.1.2.

The reality of the path is also endowed with three qualities—being pure, manifesting, and"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"706 Translationsa remedial factor. [There follows] the detailed explanation of the reasons for these [qualities]:Because of being inscrutable, because of being inexpressible,And because of being known by the noble ones, it is inconceivable. What is peaceful is free from the dual and nonconceptual.[In its] three [qualities] such as being pure, it is like the sun. 1.12The reality of cessation—the dharmakaya—is inconceivable because of being inscrutable by conceptions, because of being inexpressible by terms and words, and because of being what is to be known by the noble ones alone. The peaceful dharmakaya is free2367 from the duo of karma and afflictions and is without improper conceptions. [In its] three [qualities] such as being pure, it resembles the sun. As Asangas commentary says:“The dual” here refers to [the dual obscurations of] karma and the afflictions. “Conception” refers to improper mental engagement, the cause of the arising of karma and the afflictions. By virtue of realizing the natural cessation of this [improper mental engagement], there is no manifestation of the duo [of karma and the afflictions] or concep­tion.2368 Consequently, there is absolutely no arising of suffering. {142} This is called “the reality of the cessation of suffering.” However, it is not that the reality of the cessation of suffering is explained by virtue of the destruction of any phenomenon.2369The paths of seeing and familiarization that [consist of] nonconcep­tual wisdom are the causes for attaining the dharmakaya of the Tathagata, which bears the name “cessation of suffering.” [This wisdom] is to be un­derstood as resembling the sun by way of being similar to it in three ways. It is similar to the completely pure orb [of the sun] because it is free from all stains of the proximate afflictions. It is similar to [its capacity of] manifest­ing form because it lights up all aspects of all knowable objects. It is similar to its being the remedy for darkness because it serves as the remedy for all aspects of what obstructs seeing true reality.2.2.1.1.3. The samgha This has two parts:1.

The qualities of liberation refer to being liberated from the obscurations. Here, in terms of the mahayana samgha, the qualities of awareness {144} [consist of] the vision of the suchness of the nature of phenomena and the vision of the variety of the bearers of this nature. Both are presented as one’s own personally experienced wisdom.[There follows] the explanation [of wisdom] in terms of seeing the suchness of the nature of phenomena:The [wisdom of] suchness because of realizingThe true nature of peace of beingsIs due to the natural complete purity [of the mind]And due to the prim ordial term ination of the afflictions. 1.15This refers to seeing that m inds true nature of primordial peace that is naturally perfectly pure—the sugata heart—exists and that mistaken appearances (the adventitious afflictions) are primordially nonexistent, just like dreams and illusions.[Next, there is] the explanation [of wisdom] in terms of knowing the variety of the bearers of this nature:The [wisdom of] being varietyIs due to the intelligence that realizes the entire range of the knowable, Seeing the existence of the true nature Of omniscience in all sentient beings. 1.16[The wisdom of knowing variety means] realizing limitless and infinite knowable objects and seeing the true nature of omniscience—the sugata heart—in all sentient beings. This realization arises on the first bodhisattvabhumi because the dharmadhatu is realized as the actuality of omnipresence.[That realization is the vision Of one’s own personal wisdom.It is pure in the stainless basic elementBecause it lacks attachment and lacks obstruction.

Teaching that both the dharm a and the samgha are not the ultim ate refugeBecause of being abandoned, because of having a deceptive nature,Because of being nonexistent, and because of being fearful,The twofold dharm a and the noble assemblyAre not the ultimate supreme refuge. 1.20Among the two [kinds of] dharm a (the teaching that is the dharma of scriptures and the practice that is the dharma of realization), the scriptures, such as the sutras,2372 consist of collections of names, words, and letters. {147} At the time of the final clear realization of the path, these are to be abandoned, just like a raft. The dharma of realization is two [fold] — the cause that is the reality of the path and the result that is the reality of cessation. Among them, the path is realized to have the characteristic of being conditioned. It is not the ultimate2373 object of refuge because what is conditioned has an unreal, impermanent, delusive, and deceptive nature. In the manner of the sravakas [explaining] cessation, just as the continuum of a butter lamp s coming to a stop, it is characterized by the mere nonexistence of afflictions and suffering. However, a nonexistence is not suitable to be either a refuge or a nonrefuge.The samghas of the three yanas are not the ultimate refuge because of their always being fearful of samsara. Even arhats who have relinquished samsara, because of their not having relinquished the latent tendencies of the afflictions, [still] are immersed in a sense of fearing that all karmic for­mations have not been exhausted, just as in the example [of being afraid] of an executioner with raised sword. Therefore, even they have not at­tained the ultimate and blissful final deliverance.

Teaching the actual ultim ate refugeUltimately, the refugeO f beings is the Buddha aloneBecause the sage possesses the dharmakayaAnd because he also is the consum m ation of the assembly. 1.21The ultimate refuge is the Buddha alone because the sage without arising and ceasing is the one who possesses the kaya of the dharm a that is characterized by the two realities of cessation and the path and is free from desire and because [the assembly] of [those in] the three yanas has [nothing but] the attainment of the consummate purity of the dharmakaya as its goal.2376 [Therefore,] in this world without protection and refuge, solely the Buddha is the inexhaustible refuge, the permanent refuge, the everlasting refuge, and the ultimate refuge, [whose duration] is equal to the end of time.2.2.1.1.4.4. Explaining the m eaning of the term “jewel”They are jewels because their occurrence is rare,Because they are stainless, because they possess power,Because they are the ornam ents of the world,Because they are supreme, and because they are changeless. 1.22These three jewels are said to resemble a jewel [in six ways]. Their occurrence is rare because those who have not acquired roots of virtue do not get a chance to meet them even during many eons. They are stainless because they are free from stains such as desire in all respects. They possess power {149} because they are endowed with the inconceivable power of qualities such as the six supernatural knowledges.

In brief, the fruition of those [four causes] should be regarded, in due order and in their being the remedies that are the opposites of the four kinds of mistakenness, as the four kinds of pàramitàs that are the qualities in the dharm akaya of the Tathágata.The four kinds of mistakenness here {159} consist of regarding the pure dharmakaya as impure, regarding its supreme self as the lack of a self, regarding its bliss as suffering, and regarding its permanence as im ­permanence. The four [kinds of] unmistakenness—the remedies that are the opposites of these four—consist of the notion that the dharmakaya is permanent, the notion that it is blissful, the notion that it is a self, and the notion that it is pure. Therefore, it should be understood that the direct seeing of the pàramitàs of purity, self, bliss, and permanence of the dhar­makaya of the Tathágata is the fruition of the four causes of purity, such as faith,2384 that were explained above.

[Its] paramita of bliss should [likewise] be understood through two reasons—because of having relinquished [all] linking [to samsara] through latent tendencies due to having relinquished all aspects of the origin of suffering and because of perceiving the cessation of the body of a mental nature due to perceiving all aspects of the cessation of suffering. [Its] paramita of permanence should [also] be understood through two reasons—because of not falling into the extreme of extinction due to not reducing impermanent samsara and because of not falling into the extreme of permanence due to not augmenting permanent nirvana.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.L3.

Therefore, one should understand that the function of the basic element—the tathagata heart—is that weariness of samsara and the wish for liberation arises even in those sentient beings [whose disposition] is certain in terms of what is mistaken. Hence, [the text] says:This seeing of the flaws of suffering and the qualities of happinessIn [samsaric] existence and nirvanaOccurs [only] due to the existence of the dispositionBecause it does not [occur] in those without the disposition. 1.41The statement “Those with wrong craving have the nature of not passing into parinirvana” was made with the intention of another time for the sake of counteracting aversion toward the mahayana dharma because aversion toward the mahayana dharma is the cause of having wrong craving. It is because of the existence of the naturally pure disposition that it is not feasible for any [sentient being] to absolutely never become pure. {162}2.2.I.2.2.2.2.3.

Therefore, they are similar, respectively, to The light, heat, and color of a lamp. 1.44The topic called “endowment” is twofold (1) in terms of the basic element, the tathágata heart, being associated with [certain] causes and (2) in terms of its being associated with [certain] results. (1) First, its being associated with [certain] causes is briefly introduced by the [first] two lines “Just like the great ocean...” [in verse 1.42] and then explained in detail by the four lines “Since the basic element consists of the dharmakáya . . .” [of verse 1.43]. In the due order of [the following] three points, [the basic element] resembles the great ocean in three ways. By virtue of that, it is in terms of the tathágata elements being associated with [certain] causes that it is to be understood as the topic of endowment. Which are these three points? They consist of [the tathágata hearts being associated with] (a) the cause of the purity of the dharmakáya, (b) the cause of the accomplishment of buddha wisdom, {163} and (c) the cause of a tathágatas great compassions engaging [all beings], (a) Here, the cause of the purity of the dharmakáya is to be regarded as the cultivation of faith in the maháyána [dharma], (b) The cause of the attainment of buddha wisdom is to cultivate the doors of prajñá and samádhi. (c) The cause of a tathágatas great compassions engaging [all beings] is a bodhisattvas cultivation of compassion. Here, the cultivation of faith in the maháyána dharma resembles [the oceans] being a [big] vessel because the jewels of prajñá and samádhi as well as the water of compassion, [all of which] are immeasurable and inexhaustible, are assembled in it. The cultivation of the doors of prajñá and samádhi resembles the jewels [in this ocean] because it is nonconceptual and because it is endowed with qualities of inconceivable power. A bodhisattva’s cultivation of compassion resembles the water [in this ocean] because it possesses the single taste that is its nature of supremely moistening [the mind streams of] all beings.

By virtue of that, it is in terms of the tathagata element’s being associated with [certain] results that it is to be understood as the topic of endowment. W hich are these three points? They consist of [being endowed with] (a) the supernatural knowledges, (b) the wisdom of the termination of contaminations, and (c) the termination of contaminations. Here, (a) the five supernatural knowledges resemble the light [of the flame of a lamp] because they have the characteristic of providing the approach to overcome the darkness of the antagonistic factors of experiencing [true] actuality, (b) The wisdom of the termination of contaminations resembles the heat2386 [of the flame of a lamp] because it has the characteristic of providing the approach to consume the entire fuel of karma and afflictions without exception, (c) The termination of contaminations that is the change of the foundation resembles the color [of the flame of a lamp] because it has the characteristic of utterly stainless and pure luminosity. Here, it is stainless because the afflictive obscurations have been relinquished. It is pure because the cognitive obscurations have been relinquished. It is luminous because both these [obscurations] have the nature of being adventitious and thus have been relinquished. {167}2387 Thus, these seven dharmas in the mind streams of nonlearners (which consist of the uncontaminated supernatural knowledges, wisdom, and relinquishment) [that exist] in the uncontaminated basic element are inseparable from each other, not distinct [from each other], and associated with the dharmadhatu in terms of [both] being equal.2.2.I.2.2.2.2.4.

The dharmakaya of the teaching is also twofold due to the division of the principles of presenting the dharma that is subtle and vast.

If you won­der what its basis of intention is, it is emptiness. Its purpose is that it is [said] in order to relinquish the five flaws such as self-contempt.

Therefore, it is said in Asanga s commentary [on I.37cd] that it is free from the reference points imputed by these two [types of persons]. If the exis­tence of the sugata heart in sentient beings is not asserted, the five flaws [as stated in 1.161-65]Thus, not having heard about this,Due to the flaw of self-contempt,In some who are fainthearted,Bodhicitta will not arise ...will just remain as before.Also, the gurus from Ganden give the following explanation: “One may think that after it has been explained in the middle [cycle] of the Buddha’s words that phenomena are empty like dreams and illusions, it constitutes the flaw of [a useless and contradictory] repetition to again explain here in this Uttaratantra that the sugata heart exists because it is [nothing but] the emptiness of the m ind that is the sugata heart. This is indeed the case, but [Maitreya only] taught the existence of the sugata heart in all sentient beings in order to relinquish the flaws of faintheartedness and so forth.” {208} [Thus,] they do not assert that the emptiness of mind’s being empty of real existence in the mind streams of sentient beings exists insepara­bly from the qualities such as the [ten] powers. They also say, “The sugata heart is nothing but the emptiness of m ind’s being empty of real existence, which is a nonimplicative negation.” [However,] since there are no aspects of qualities whatsoever in that [nonimplicative negation], it contradicts the explanation that the sugata heart and the dharmakaya are equivalent. For [Uttaratantra I.86a] says about the meaning of the dharmakaya that it isthe inseparability of the buddha attributes.You may wonder, “But what is it that is called sugata heart’?” It is just as [Uttaratantra 1.63] says:"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"754 TranslationsThe luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.It is not afflicted by adventitious stains,Such as desire, born from false imagination.This completes the section on the tathagata heart in An Analysis of the Jewel Disposition, A Treatise on the “Ultimate Continuum of the Mahayanaf [with] the exposition of the summarized meaning of the verses of the first [chapter].2.2.2.

Through this, they recognize study2420—the natural outflow of the dharmadhátu—to be supreme and therefore, for this purpose,2421 [are willing to] even plunge themselves into a fire pit that has the size of the greatest chiliocosm in a trichiliocosm. On the fourth one, they realize [the dharmadhátu] as the actuality of nonclinging. Thus, they even put an end to craving for the dharma. On the fifth one, they realize the actuality of [all] mind streams, not being different—they realize the equality of completely pure mind and intention in ten aspects. On the sixth one, they realize the actuality of neither affliction nor purity because they realize that, in the actuality of2422 dependent origination, there is no phenomenon that is either afflicted or pure. On the seventh one, they realize [the dharmadhátu] as the actuality of no difference. {235} For, by virtue of the lack of characteristics, different characteristics of phenomena (such as the sütras) do not transpire. On the eighth one, they realize [the dharmadhátu] as the actuality of neither decrease nor increase. For, by virtue of having attained the poised readiness for the dharma of nonarising, they do not see any decrease or increase with regard to afflicted or purified phenomena.

They regard themselves and all sentient beings as equal in terms of having the true nature of a tathágata. The activity of liberating all sentient beings is still not fully completed. Because of [all that], enlightened activity—the deeds [of buddhas]—is uninterrupted until samsára has become empty.In this context, as for the question here whether samsára does or does not have an end, some tlrthikas assert that there is a beginning point of samsára. Among Buddhists, the factions of the srávakas and also the sys­tems of certain maháyánists assert that samsára does not have a beginning point. As for a final end [of samsára], samsára in general is without end be­cause {238} there is no time at which samsára becomes empty. Individually, [samsára] has an end because each sentient beings attainment of liberation is nothing but the end of their [individual] samsára.

[That man] asked him, “If you are learned in the dharma, do you know the understanding of killing?” Answering, “I know it,” [he gave an explanation but] became confused through coming up with a lot of classifications. [Maitreya] said, “ You do not even know a speck of the true dharma,” which made him lose his pride. [Maitreyanatha said,] “Well, I request some dharma [from you then].” [Maitreya] replied, “Since there is the explanation of [my] five dharmas in Jambudvlpa, I give you an instruction [on them].” Then, he said, “In general, the instruction of the Uttaratantra, which makes the basic nature a living experience, combines the triad of the cause, the conditions, and the results.2441 In particular, [this text] points out to trust [in this basic nature] through the four inconceivable [points (l)-(4)].”2442 He said, “Since this is a dream, jump into water and an abyss, and recognize that all phenomena are like a dream!” Through having jumped into water, [Maitreyanatha] recognized [his dream] as a dream. Then, [Maitreya] pointed out all the [following] instructions within that [dream] by invoking [Maitreyanatha s] mindfulness of [recognizing] his dream.

He continued, “Cut through fear and clinging, and jump into the fire!” {148} [Upon doing so, Maitreyanatha felt that his] body [with which he had] jumped dissolved into space, and he thus experienced the sheer awareness of great bliss, in which nothing whatsoever is observable. In the space of this [awareness], a sound arose, proclaiming, “Consider2443 now whose man and fear went where!” Since this was [only] a dream of his, the insight of thinking, “In what is without basis, there is no coming and go­ing” arose in him. At that point, [Maitreya said,] “You are naturally pure,” and [Maitreyanatha re] appeared in space as the man he was before. Then, his own body [re] appeared, and all appearances [too re] emerged in that [space]. [Maitreya asked,] “W hat [do you think] this was?” [Maitreyanatha] replied, “All this happened in a dream.” [Maitreya] asked, “From what did it arise?” [Maitreyanatha] said, “It was a dream [caused] by thinking. It did not arise from anything else but arose from space.” [Maitreya] said, “You should understand that, just like that, all phenomena arise from the mind that is naturally pure.” At that point, [Maitreya] pointed out that it is incon­ceivable that adventitious afflictions arise in the m ind that is naturally pure.(2) [Next, Maitreya] pointed out, “It is inconceivable to have become a buddha once the adventitious afflictions have become pure, just as it was uncertain where your body went when you had jumped into fire [in your dream].” (3) [Then, Maitreya] pointed out, “Your body dissolved into space, and at first you were afraid, [but then] you recognized that it was a dream, and you recognized that [everything] is of one nature without any difference.

The clinging to the objects of the six doors of the operating [consciousnesses],2446 which are preceded by the cause of not realizing [the nature of the m ind]—the wind of improper mental engagement2447—obstructs the nature of phenomena.

Through clinging to m ind’s essence—the true end—as being conditioned, based on mentation,2449 it is taken to be a self. This obstructs the realization of supportless prajna. Through the meeting of m ind and object, the latent tendencies [in the alaya- consciousness] are awakened. Consciousness is tainted by the afflictions of attachment and aversion, which obstructs mind’s liberation.As for pointing out that the root of [all] this—the nonabiding root—is [the root of] the wind of thoughts,2450 through mentally engaging through prajna in [the fact that] the nature of the mind does not abide as karma (the cause) and the afflictions (the result), the wisdom of realizing suchness is pointed out. Through mentally engaging through compassion in [the fact that] other2451 sentient beings do not realize the nature of their minds, the wisdom of realizing variety is pointed out.

He gave him point­ing-out instructions in a general way by combining the two [points] of the cause and the conditions with the third [point], the results. In particular, he gave pointing-out instructions on the cause as being the changeless nature of phenomena2517 and gave pointing-out instructions on the four incon­ceivable [points]. Later, when [Maitreyanatha] awoke, though some dhar­mas [of those that had been pointed out by Maitreya] arose in his mind, he was not satisfied [with remembering only that much].2518 Therefore, he thought, “Even though I was cared for by the compassion of noble [Mai­treya] in person, I do not have the power to retain the dharma.” Thereafter, [he went] to a stùpa he had circumambulated earlier, from which a light that had not been there before came forth. Then, wondering whether there might be instructions [in that stúpa], he opened it and [these instructions] emerged.[He passed them on to] the pandita Ànandakîrti,2519 who [later] thought, “I will entrust [these instructions] in detail to my disciple [Ratn]a- karašanti.”2520 Then he went to Kashmir and [there] was served and hon­ored by guru Sajjana2521 in many ways. Therefore, he asked, “W hat do you expect from a beggar like me?” [Sajjana] requested the instructions on the Uttaratantra and the instructions on the Dharmadharmatâ[vibhâga] that were in the possession [of Ànandakîrti]. [Ànandakîrti said,] “Because you so-called pandita are of such great pride, your mind as such cannot be pointed out as luminosity.” [Sajjana] asked, “But how [can] this pride be broken?” [Ànandakîrti] said, “You think you know the five Maitreya dhar­mas, but you do not even understand a single point.” Through talking about the dharma [in such a way], he broke [Sajjana’s] pride.

Therefore, the [single best] instruction on true actuality is the Mahayanottaratantra. [That instruction] is contained in this [text] as the seven vajra points. W hat is called “the Buddha” refers to the self-arisen wisdom in which thoughts are terminated through realizing the actuality of the luminosity of your own mind.2529 What is called “the dharma” is twofold—the ultimate dharma is the reality of cessation, and the wisdom of realizing it is the reality of the path. Cessation and the luminosity of your own mind are inconceivable—they refer to what is free from thoughts and afflictions. In the path, three features must be complete, which refer to the following. Through realizing the luminosity of your own mind, the afflictions accumulated before become pure. The nature of knowable objects is clearly realized as luminosity. [The dharma] serves as the remedy for the subsequent operation of the superimposing mind.2530 The samgha refers to the simultaneous arising of the prajna of realizing your own m ind as luminosity and the compassion of realizing the minds of others as luminosity.2531These three are asserted as being the objects of refuge until you realize the true nature of your own m ind as such. This refers to the temporary go­ing for refuge [on the level of] seeming [reality]. {294} [The guru] says that when [this going for refuge] has arisen in the mind stream, the certainty that the three jewels possess blessings arises.2532 The ultimate lasting object of refuge refers to the realization of your own mind as the dharmakaya. If your thoughts are not terminated, you are not able to protect [yourself and others] from suffering. In order to terminate your own thoughts, you need to familiarize with the dharmakaya. If this nature of your own m ind is buddhahood [in the first place], it cannot be [newly] brought about.2533789"},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"790 TranslationsThat the nature of the mind is buddhahood is called “the basic element.” The continuum of thoughts of not realizing that [nature] is called “a sen­tient being.” That “sentient beings possess the buddha heart”2534 refers to their own minds’ being obscured by thoughts. [The guru] says that since what is called “the luminosity of one’s own m ind” does not serve as an ob­ject of thoughts, it is pure without [needing to] be restored by remedies. “[What] is the cause for not realizing it?” It is obscured through the nonar­ising of trust in the mahayana. “The mahayana” refers to the simultaneous arising of compassion and the prajna of realizing your own mind as lumi­nosity. Though the dharmakaya is naturally pure, the seed of [its] being free from adventitious stains2535 is taught to be the faith in the dharma of the mahayana. Since people whose minds are not altered by philosophical systems and who cling to samsara do not have this seed of becoming a bud­dha, {295} they do not realize [the dharmakaya]. You may say, “[But it] is taught [in Uttaratantra 1.28] that the mahayana disposition pervades [all] sentient beings.” There is not a single sentient being who is not pervaded by the naturally abiding disposition—the unconditioned dharmakaya that is the nature of all sentient beings. From that point of view, the disposition is indeed not cut-off [in any sentient being]. The accomplished disposition refers to the seed of realizing luminosity—the arising of the power of being weary of samsara. Those in whom the weariness of samsara through the condition of hearing the mahayana dharma does not arise are those with the cut-off disposition.2536W hat is called “dharmakaya” refers to m ind’s natural purity, through realizing [this purity], having become pure of the stains of thoughts in­cluding their latent tendencies. W hat is called “buddha wisdom” refers to the realization of the actuality that cannot be expressed by terms or be con­ceived by the stains of thoughts. You may wonder, “Do buddhas know or not know the appearances of mistakenness of sentient beings?” W hen they know them, they know them [through seeing] that the natural luminosity of sentient beings is pure in a way that is not different from the buddhas themselves. This is called “the welfare of others in terms of [all-]knowing wisdom.” That [buddhas] know that the adventitious thoughts of sentient beings are terminated right from the beginning is called “the welfare of others in terms of loving compassion.”2537You may wonder, “If [buddhas] know that the thoughts [of sentient beings] are terminated, bound by what are sentient beings circling [in samsara] right now?” {296} They are bound by clinging through their af­flictions to the appearances of thoughts. “W hat is the difference between"},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"The Repository of Wisdom 791ordinary beings and the realizations of bodhisattvas who have attained their individual bhumis?” Ordinary beings take the unfolding of the con­ceptual appearances of the thoughts of not at all realizing the luminosity of their own minds as being actual reality. Bodhisattvas, through realizing the luminosity of their own wisdom, realize that all samsaric appearances are mere thoughts.After they have attained the bhumis, all bodhisattvas exist as [having] a mental body. “[But] it is taught that they have the bodies of cakravartins and so on.” [The guru] says that if [bodhisattvas] are born through the power of aspiration prayers, they lack any bodies of flesh and blood. You may wonder, “Must then the [physical] support in which they first generated the path2538 circle as such a body of flesh and blood?” In the abhidharma texts, one finds [explanations on bodhisattvas’] casting off their bodies [of flesh and blood] upon seeing reality on the first bhumi.You may ask, “W hat is the difference between the realizations of the wisdoms of the ten bhumis?” There is the difference of terminating the individual stains of thoughts [of each bhumi] by virtue of meditating through the efforts of realizing the luminosity of their own minds. This is taught through the example of the ten phenomena [needed] to [progres­sively] cleanse a gem.“W hat does what is called ‘nirvana’ refer to?” It refers to the stream of samsaric suffering’s having been severed. You may say, “Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are [also] explained to [have] mental bodies.” {297} W ith the inconceivable dharm adhatu’s functioning as the cause of uncontam ­inated karma and the latent tendencies of ignorance’s functioning as the conditions, they possess the arising of the skandhas of mental bodies and [also] their inconceivable deaths. Upon being exhorted by the compassion of the buddhas, [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] are made to gather the ac­cumulations through emanation bodies and thus eventually become bud­dhas [too]. In the end, [everybody] proceeds in the single yana. The teacher [said] that the three yanas and having [three] dispositions exist in the body.“If it is taught that maturational wisdom exists on the three ffuitional bhumis, what is the difference from buddha wisdom?” In terms of the es­sence of wisdom, [these wisdoms] are equal in that they do not require any effort. The intention behind the explanation of these three bhumis lies in the three [different sets of] qualities that benefit [sentient beings]. This is explained through the example of a grown-up prince who has not yet been empowered [as king].2539 [However, the guru] says that there is a difference [between the wisdom of the last three bhumis and the one of a buddha]"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"792 Translationsbecause the wisdom [of a buddha] is perfect by virtue of having terminated [all] latent tendencies of thoughts.“W hat does the certainty that arises in the continuum of the path refer to?” Through realizing minds luminosity, thoughts and afflictions become smaller. W hen compassion for sentient beings arises, the dharma has be­come the path. “How does one gain certainty based on luminosity?” [It is through] knowing the nature of your own m ind through the lack of arising and ceasing or through the stopping of [all] expression. In general, when meditating [according to] venerable Maitreya, {298} there are two ways of thoughts disintegrating when meditating—there is the disintegration of thoughts through analyzing by thinking2540 about how so-called character­istics of nature appear and how their nature is or the disintegration [of thoughts] without depending on meditating on an image that appears in the thinking mind. These two [ways of the disintegration of thoughts] do not come to be mixed.“W hat does what is called adventitious flaws’ refer to?” It refers to the mistaken appearances of thoughts. “Are they a mistakenness that has a ba­sis or a mistakenness that lacks [a basis]?” Though they are the mistaken­ness that has the nature of phenomena as its basis, the essence of thoughts is both mistakenness that has [a basis] and mistakenness that lacks [a ba­sis]—they are mistakenness through taking the self-arisen wisdom that is beyond thought and expression as the object of thoughts.“W hat is the difference between the sambhogakaya and the nirmana- [kaya]?” [They appear] as if adorned with the major and minor marks, being the appearances of images of samadhi and wisdom in those to be guided. Through gaining certainty that they are appearances of one’s own mind, after attaining the bhumis, they become the sambhogakaya. [When] apprehended as actual [independently existing] buddhas outside of one’s mind, they become nirmanakayas. [However,] they are not different in es­sence. In general, there are two [explanations] of the two kinds of rupa- kayas—being explained as maturational results and being explained as [results] that are concordant with their cause. {299}“Are all these [phenomena] such as mountains and houses an appear­ance of thoughts or are they something that exists on the outside?” They are an appearance of thoughts and do not exist on the outside, similar to mountains, houses, [and so on,] appearing in a dream.“Do our [ordinary] appearances appear or not appear for those on the bhumis?” Since our appearances appear like dreams, they do not turn into compassion for the welfare of others.

Once the sky of your own m ind has become pure, Sukhavatl has arrived right here. “How do you answer [the question of why] the face of [Amitabha and Sukhavatl] are not seen [now]?” [The guru] says that they are obscured by the thoughts of the five degenerations.“W hat do karmic obscurations refer to?” They refer to the five [actions] of immediate consequence or rejecting the dharma. “W hat do matura- tional obscurations refer to?” They refer to those that arise from clinging to a self and obstruct liberation. “W hat do cognitive obscurations refer to?” They refer to those that arise from the empty dharmakaya and obstruct the attainment of buddhahood.“[Among] the two [options] of turning ones mind away from desire and the arising of weariness of samsara, which one is better?” Turning ones m ind away from desire exists in tlrthikas too. {300} The arising of wea­riness of samsara is the first step on the [Buddhist] path. W hat is called “samsara” consist of your own five skandhas. If you become repulsed after having realized them to be the root of suffering, weariness arises. Here, when the clinging to a self is understood as mistakenness, this is the first step on the path of ¿ravakas. In my opinion, aren’t there many who are deceived through limited [forms of] meditation due to not knowing how to examine and analyze2542 their own skandhas?“How are the three kayas of a buddha attained?” The dharmakaya re­fers to the actuality of the unconditioned luminosity of your own mind, in which all thoughts have been terminated. The sambhogakaya is the appear­ance of self-arisen wisdom as the thirty-two major marks, which is simulta­neous with the termination of thoughts. The nirmanakaya is what appears [of that self-arisen wisdom] to those with pure mind streams.2543 If there is an explanation of the nirmanakaya in terms of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, it is not asserted here.“Is the continuum of wisdom severed or not severed on the bud- dhabhumi?” If buddha wisdom existed as something conditioned, its con­tinuum would not be severed, but then there is the danger of its following that it is not different from [the wisdom of] bodhisattvas. [The guru] says that [to say that] the continuum of [buddha] wisdom is not severed is just one [possible] position. It is because self-arisen wisdom does not form a continuum [in the first place] that there is not really anything about whom"},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"794 Translationsit could be said that its continuum is not severed. Thus, it abides without arising and ceasing because thoughts have been terminated. “So how is that different from the continuum of wisdom’s being severed?” {301} The sev­ering of a continuum is asserted [here] as being nothing but the nature of phenomena [remaining], just as space [alone remains] due to what is conditioned having been terminated. Here, [buddha] wisdom, which is not formed through the conceptual mind, exists in a manner that is beyond expression. Therefore, there is no difference [between saying that its con­tinuum is severed or not severed].“How are the five [kinds of] beings mistaken?” The essence of thoughts is self-arisen wisdom—the dharmadhâtu.2544 This life is nothing but seeing that basic nature [of the dharmadhâtu as] the appearances of mistaken­ness. Through not having recognized and not having experienced the ap­pearances of mistakenness as being appearances of mistakenness before, the continuum of samsàra remains uninterrupted. “How is mistakenness put to an end?” It is put to an end through putting an end to clinging to mis­takenness as being real and thus stopping the wind of improper mental en­gagement.2545 Venerable Maitreya said that he has protection wherever he is, whereas beings with a m ind without protection are immersed in suffer­ing due to their minds’ not being at peace under the influence of afflictions.“Isn’t the existence of self-arisen buddhahood canceled out through the realization of Madhyamaka?” [The realization of Madhyamaka] cancels out what is conditioned, which consists of the adventitious stains.2546 To stop the clinging to the real existence2547 of the objects of thoughts is in accord with Madhyamaka. Since self-arisen wisdom is taken [here] to exist without an object, there is a difference [between it and what is conditioned] in that [wisdom] exists.“If self-arisen {302} wisdom exists, what difference is there to the self-awareness of Mere Mentalism?” To assert that all these appearances are appearances of thoughts is in accord with Mere Mentalism. However, there is a difference by virtue of asserting that at the time of realizing their luminosity, thoughts are self-arisen wisdom—the dharmakàya.In general, the guru teaches that the pair of the ultimate and buddha­hood has the same essence. Also, the pair of the seeming and sentient beings has the same essence. He holds that there are two [kinds] of the seeming. He says that the impure seeming consists of those who wander around in samsàra by virtue of the dharmakàya s being obscured [through] their minds [being full] of afflictions and karma. The pure seeming consists"},{"pageNumber":811,"pageContent":"The Repository of Wisdom 795of the noble ones because they, through having realized the dharmakaya, realize all appearances of thoughts as being like dreams and illusions.“But is one able or not able to become a buddha without performing conditioned virtue?” [The guru] says that one is not able [to become a buddha without performing conditioned virtue]. “How is it that one is not able?” For example, though a precious gem [always] exists in an unaltered way [even when surrounded by dross], its qualities2548 do not visibly m ani­fest if it is not cleansed. Likewise, though the buddha who is the luminosity of your own mind exists, it does not perform the activity of a buddha if it is not liberated from the afflictions. Therefore, he says, it is very im portant to purify the obscurations of sentient beings and to gather the accumula­tions—the causes of the wisdoms of the ten2549 bhumis. However, it is not that [buddha] wisdom is produced by conditioned virtue due to buddha wisdoms arising [from] conditioned virtue {303} and [thus] something previously [nonexistent] being brought forth or made. “If it were produced, what flaw is there?” [The guru] says that since [buddha wisdom] would be conditioned, its continuum would be severed, once its causes become ter­minated, and then the welfare of sentient beings would not come about. “So what is gathering the accumulations good for?” He says that the wis­doms of the ten bhumis must arise in the mind stream through dispelling the present coarse stains of mistakenness, and for that the accumulations need to be gathered. “[So does that mean that] one speaks of ‘the causes of the wisdoms of the ten bhumis that actually fulfill the definitions [of such causes]’ [but] that these do not exist in such a way on the buddhabhumi?” He says that they do not. He says that what is called a “continuum” refers to conditioned conceptions, [but] conditioned conceptions are terminated on the buddhabhumi.“W hen the thoughts of clinging to the real existence of what is condi­tioned first arise in the mind stream, they do not exist, but since wisdom exists in them, is it not that a continuum comes about?” He says that it is [only] from our own perspective that the wisdoms of the ten bhumis [seem to] become wisdoms, [but] from the perspective of a buddha [even] a single subtle thought in itself is [wisdom]. If that were not the case,2550 he says, one would not be able to be born in a mental body since that is impure by virtue of four transitions.“But how could it be tenable to become liberated through thoughts?” He says that the actual thoughts of ordinary beings are liberated through the thoughts2551 of sravakas.

He says that those are [only] present in the dharmas composed by ordinary beings. “How could it be tenable for scriptural quotations to be absent in [the compositions of] noble ones?” He says that scriptural quotations are needed for blind people to walk on the path, but what good would scriptural quotations do for people with eyesight walking on the path? In presentations of philosophical systems by following words, there are refutations, [but] there is nothing to be refuted in the realization of true actuality.

As for familiarizing with your own m ind as being suchness, it is inconceivable that there are stains in natural purity at the time2562 of sentient beings.

Think that you shall never be separated from the dharmas that you practice until you attain buddhahood and that you shall promote the welfare of all piti­able sentient beings in samsara throughout all your lifetimes. The means for that are as follows. Think that the nature of all appearances is emptiness free from reference points. These nonexistent delusive appearances resem­ble appearances in a dream—at the very time of their appearing, they are not established. The mind is not real either—the past mind does not exist after it has ceased, and the present mind is not established as any essence, color, shape, and so on. No matter where you may search for it (inside, outside, and so on), you do not find it. Thus, having understood the m ind too to be unborn and free from reference points, settle it in the state of nonconceptuality. Through meditating like that, at the point of dying, the nonconceptuality that abides as the natural state and the nonconceptuality of meditation meet like mother and child. Thus, a very excellent state of nonconceptuality arises. For example, if you drain water onto an already moist field, it becomes thoroughly soaked. If your breath stops within that state of nonconceptuality, you will attain Mahamudra in the intermediate state—it is taught that there is a great chance in that for not being reborn.The source for this is that noble Akasagarbha asked the Buddha, “How should bodhisattvas look when they are at the point of dying?” “They should cultivate the mind like this: those of supreme faculties should not think about nonvirtue, cultivate compassion for sentient beings, familiarize with appearances and awareness as being empty, and settle within being801"},{"pageNumber":818,"pageContent":"802 Translationsfree from reference points.

They should familiarize with the notion of nonreferentiality since all phenomena are naturally luminous.”2565 This is the source that gives rise to trust.

The m anner in which the perfect buddhakaya radiates or buddhas come aboutAt the point when the wisdom of realization—the awareness that exists pri­mordially as not being different from the sugata heart as the expanse—rises from the expanse that is the profound matrix of the sugata heart, all seeds of obscuration are relinquished. The self-awareness of this wisdom2572 of realization is accomplished through the wisdom of the fundamental change of [having gathered] immeasurable accumulations [of merit and wisdom]. You may wonder, “How is it accomplished?” The cognition that frees from stains [and exists] in the cognizance of sentient beings that is associated with obscurations {15} is blessed by the inconceivable power of the wisdom [of a buddha]. In addition, there [also] exists the element of wisdom in the element that is the cognition [of sentient beings] free from stains. It is by virtue of the power of both [the cognition that frees from stains and is blessed by buddha wisdom and the intrinsic wisdom of sentient beings] that their cognizance fundamentally changes into being without stains, and thus the wisdom of realization becomes of one taste with the dhar- makaya. Then, with [this wisdom dharmakaya’s] not being different from the buddha qualities that are the primordially abiding buddha attributes, it performs a tathagatas activity of accomplishing ones own consummate welfare and that of others.25732.1.1.2. Identifying the wisdom of realizationYou may wonder, “W hat is to be realized in such a way by this wisdom of realization?” It directly ascertains the expanse of all tathagatas. The type of realization that ascertains this consists of the type of realization [that occurs] during the duration of the actual vajra-like samadhi and the ten [realizations] from the first to the tenth bhumi, which are conducive to final deliverance and accord with the [vajra-like samadhi].2.1.1.3. Teaching the m anner in which wisdom exists primordially (the cause for [buddhas5] coming about)For, by virtue of this type of realization's existing primordially, it is not that the entirety of what is accomplished through the paths that depend on the [primary] minds and mental factors of ordinary beings becomes a"},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":"8o6 Translationspointless [effort of] tiring oneself out, and [this primordial wisdom] serves as the basis or foundation for meaningfully aspiring [for it] in a correct and proper manner.Therefore, the means to generate the actual type of realization of the vajra-like samadhi are as follows. In the beginning, the minds and men­tal factors of ordinary beings are rendered pure through the power of the triad of study, reflection, and meditation. Thereafter, without having to rely on the power of any [element] among the triad of study, reflection, and meditation, {16} but in a self-arisen manner, the wisdom that is vajra-like realization is able to overcome the legions of ignorance right upon their being met by the illumination of wisdom for a single m om ent at the same time, just as the orb of the sun, in a single instant of its shining, completely eradicates the darkness of the latent tendencies of ignorance.

Sugatahoods being m ani­fested is called “dharmakaya.” Though what is called “dharmakaya” abides throughout all three states, when it is specified through [all] the hosts of the obscurations having been relinquished, it is all-pervading in that it is what pervades all phenomena (dharmas) and is able to display an inexhaustible [number of] kayas that engage [in the welfare of all sentient beings in many different forms].

This undifferentiable wisdom together with its qualities, just as it is, is also present in those who are not free from the cocoon of the afflictions. Hence, all phenomena of samsara and nirvana abide as equality. {18} You may wonder here, “W hat is equal­ity?” It is an expression for ultimate reality—the tathagata heart, but it is the actualization of the state of personally experienced wisdom within the unsurpassable expanse of the tathagata heart that represents the meaning"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"8o8 Translationsof [saying,] “Unsurpassable completely perfect buddhas have gone to the heart of awakening in worldly realms.”25772.1.2.2.1.2. [Detailed explanation of] this very [fact’s] being dependent on the sugata heartTherefore, since the tathágata heart has the essential character of all qual­ities, right after the linkage [to samsára] through the latent tendencies of the afflictions [that exist] in all sentient beings has been overcome, the spontaneous and uninterrupted deeds of a tathágata are displayed as the sphere of this very tathágata. Through the power of the tathágatas’ having gained mastery over all phenomena at that point, they are able to [teach] the wheel of dharma of definitive meaning and demonstrate the inconceiv­able [points to] the disciples who dwell on the great [bodhisattva]bhümis in a single instant. This is the true nature of the tathágatas.25782.1.2.2.1.3. [Detailed explanation of] the m anner in which other M adhyamaka systems do not realize thisHere, some who flatter themselves as being Mádhyamikas of the maháyána [but] do not understand the discourses of the dharma wheel of irrevers­ibility,2579 under the sway of [misconceiving] tathágatahood as consisting of nothing but emptiness, cling to the point that ultimate reality cannot be demonstrated as anything whatsoever. Thus, they do not reach the basic na­ture, the ultimate definitive meaning, in the maháyána. {19} You may won­der why that is. This [kind of tathágatahood that is nothing but emptiness] would be equal to the emptiness of the árávaka and pratyekabuddha arhats [in the sense of] a continuum’s becoming extinct. However, unsurpassable completely perfect buddhahood represents the accomplishment of ones own welfare and that of others. That is, since tathágatas are endowed with the display of many amazing, overwhelming, and inexhaustible miracles that never come to an end, the qualities and activities of buddhas have the nature of being permanent and enduring. That this is ultimate reality is the position of the great Mádhyamika Asañga.25802.1.2.2.1.4. [Detailed explanation of] the m anner in which three qualities manifest upon the manifestation of the sugata heartTherefore, you may wonder, “W hat is the reason for labeling the tathágata heart on the buddhabhümi with the name ‘dharmakáya’?” The bodies of ordinary beings and [bodhisattvas] on the level of engagement through as­piration are contaminated collections of the five appropriating skandhas."},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 809The bodies of arhats and bodhisattvas who dwell on the bhumis are uncon­taminated [and seemingly physical] emanations of a mental nature. The kaya of a perfect buddha is the dharmadhatu as being embodied in a single all-pervading lord and displaying as many aspects. This dharmakaya—the kaya that is liberated from everything contaminated and uncontaminated— is primordially free from birth, death, transition, and change. Therefore, it represents the relinquishment of [all] conditioned factors and, within it, [all] the hosts of reference points are primordially at peace and the ocean of buddha qualities is spontaneously present. The [cognizing] subject that is the type of realization that realizes this very [dharmakaya] {20} does not depend on any other hosts of reference points but is self-awareness by nature. Therefore, by virtue of this self-awarenesss being pure through its very [own] purity, it is not dependent on anything else. This is the un­surpassable system.2581 By virtue of the qualities of this [self-awareness, tathagatas] know their own welfare and that of others, and, through their loving-kindness, they purify the stains of other sentient beings.25822.1.2.2.1.5. Detailed explanation of the m anner in which [the sugata heart] is not realized through any conditions that are other features Therefore, venerable Asanga said that the wisdom of instantaneously realizing tathagatahood in a completely perfect manner refers to [bud- dhahood’s] “being completely and perfectly realized as being inexpress­ible in nature . . . through the self-arisen wisdom without a master.”2583 In accordance with this meaning, the Sthavira Vasubandhu says in his M ahdydnasutrdlamkarabhdsya:The wisdom of pratyekabuddhas, just as it is, is not different from whatis to be [mentally] formed first by a perfect buddha.2584Others say, “Thus, right upon perfect buddhas’ becoming buddhas, all tathagatas, through bestowing the empowerment of great light rays, be­come their masters. In the mantra tradition, right upon perfect buddhas’ becoming buddhas, they dwell in the meditation of the extraordinary ulti­mate mind of tathagatas, the vajra of luminosity.” These are nothing more than mere means, whereas a buddhas own wisdom arises from itself, be­cause its own mastering itself {21} does not depend on the mind streams of other tathagatas. [It depends] solely on the specifically characterized [mind stream] that will become a buddha. After having become a buddha, it is undifferentiable from all buddhas.2585"},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"8io TranslationsTherefore, the great Madhyamika, venerable Asanga, holds that [during the vajra-like samadhi] at the end of the path of familiarization, in this very m ind stream that will become a buddha and in which tathagatahood abides, remedial self-awareness dawns and thus everything to be relinquished [at this point] is relinquished without exception. However, as far as [all] the other factors to be relinquished through seeing and familiarization [before this last moment of the path of familiarization] go, the coarse and sub­tle afflictions in a mind stream that will [eventually] become a buddha are eliminated through the vajra-like and swordlike powers of the compassion and wisdom of other tathagatas.2586 This system must be transmitted from the very quintessence of the pith instructions of Lord Maitreya—others lack the good fortune of [grasping] this profound meaning.25872.1.2.2.2.

You may"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 811wonder why that is. Through the assessing cognitions of ordinary beings, which are not [ultimate] valid cognitions, the basic nature of the dharm a— the [only] true valid cognition—is not seen. This is what master Asanga and his brother say.25892.1.2.2.2.2. The m anner in which it is not suitable if this is linked to emptiness aloneHowever, Candraklrti, Haribhadra, and others assert that the ultimate basic nature is the nonfinding of the dharma element through cognitions of ordi­nary beings examining it by way of the reasoning of refuting any arising of existents and nonexistents [and so on]. Here, noble Asanga and his brother hold the following.2590 The basic nature that is inferred by way of terms, articulations, speech, etymologies, conventions, or designations is not the factor that is the ultimate. [No matter] how much effort one makes through the capacity of the dialectical m ind and {23} no matter whether [the ulti­mate basic nature] is analyzed as existent, nonexistent, [both] existent and nonexistent, or neither, [all of this] is trifling. It is through the power of yoga that, without thinking and without conceptions and expressions, the hosts of improper conceptions—the origin [of suffering that consists of] karma and afflictions—are put to an end. By virtue of their having been put to an end, at that point, there arises the self-arisen wisdom that is the pra- jna without attachment and obstruction,2591 which discriminates [the way] phenomena and the nature of phenomena truly are and [the way] in which they appear.25922.1.2.2.2.3. The m anner of being liberated from attachm ent and obstructionThis arising as the prajna without attachment and obstruction is tathaga- tahood itself. If you wonder why, this is because what arises through the power of the yoga of proper mental engagement is not motivated by igno­rance and, by virtue of this essential point, is not connected with the alaya- mind, the afflicted mind, and the cognitions that conceive of objects.2593 That which is proper mental engagement is without arising and without ceasing—this profound actuality is not the object of ordinary beings.2594 Therefore, since [all] adventitious elements are, from the beginning, not arisen, not originated, and without termination, these adventitious ele­ments are also free from ceasing, being terminated, and being put to an end. Hence, in this system, it is asserted that through self-arisen wisdom s looking at the factors that are the adventitious stains of its own continuum,"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"8i2 Translations{24} no attributes or bearers of attributes, which make up the adventitious stains, are to be seen. At that point, through [this wisdom’s] being free from all stains, it manifests the true actuality.25952.L2.2.2.4. The m anner in which mere nonseeing is not true reality Candraklrti and others identify the [fact that] the nature of phenomena is not seen by the ultimate nature of phenomena as “seeing ultimate reality.” However, let alone speaking of this as the ultimate, they would have to ac­cept many contradictions in their own systems even in terms of words [on the level] of seeming [reality]. Therefore, in order to eliminate this flaw, they say, “We Madhyamikas have no assertion whatsoever.”25962.I.2.2.2.5. Teaching that the primordially established sugata heart is also the nature of this jewel of the dharm aIn this system, the ultimate is the object that is seen by the tathagatas—that which [truly] exists in just the way it is in actual reality. The completely pure seeing of the tathagatas is the realization of the wisdom of equality that there is nothing to be removed since, in its nature, ultimate reality is not tainted by obscuring stains and that there is no wisdom that is other [than] this very [ultimate reality] to be added to it. After having become lastingly free from the adventitious stains,2597 in the dharma wheel of the tathagatas, [which serves as] the remedy for clinging to true reality as being a nonexistent, they instruct on the need to accomplish nonconceptual wis­dom —the cause that accomplishes the state of the dharmakaya—through making efforts on the paths of seeing and familiarization.2598 As for [speak­ing of] “the need to accomplish [this wisdom as] the cause of the dhar­makaya,” {25} this is not an explanation on needing to clearly manifest a previously nonexistent cause, but it means to make efforts in the means for a previously existing cause clearly appearing later.Here, some who flatter themselves as being Madhyamikas have many assertions about being free from reference points by virtue of dialectical reasonings about whether the result exists or does not exist at the time of the cause. However, in this [system of] definitive meaning here, it is as­serted that, no matter during which state, in the perfect sugata heart, cause and result do not exist as two. Just as with the element of water, gold, and space, cause and result abide inseparably at all times.2599"},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 8132.1.2.2.3.

The m ean­ing of mind’s being naturally luminous is that [dualistic] mind disappears in the natural expanse [of m ind’s nature]—seeming phenomena are empty of a nature of their own, while luminosity is inseparable from the tathagata heart. The nature of this inseparability is the svabhavikakaya (“nature kaya”). If it did not exist, {26} nothing in samsara and nirvana would be possible.Mind, mentation, consciousness, karma, afflictions, and suffering are adventitious. Since the afflictions are not established by virtue of [really existing] causes and conditions, they have no nature. If there were [such] causes that produce the adventitious afflictions, they would have a nature, but there are no [such] causes that produce them.

Teaching that, therefore, the qualities of the samgha exist prim ordiallyTherefore, the tathagata heart, just as it is, exists in all beings. This tathagata heart is labeled2603 with the name “the selfless self.” This does not refer to [there being] two kinds of self (or identity) in the beginning and their be­ing destroyed later because [the tathagata heart] is the completely pure na­ture of their being at peace primordially.2604Hence, it is feasible for natural luminosity and adventitious stains to co­exist within the uncontaminated expanse. At the same time, it is not feasi­ble for the adventitious stains to [ever] touch natural luminosity, {27} nor is it feasible for natural luminosity to touch the afflictions. Natural luminosity does not need anything other that illuminates it, while afflicted cognitions are afflicted through these very afflictions themselves—natural luminosity does not conceive of, or cling to, afflictions.26052.1.2.2.3.4. Identifying the wisdoms of suchness and variety in this systemTherefore, in this system, [the wisdom of] realizing suchness refers to the noble ones realization of the tathagata heart in their own m ind streams. [The wisdom of realizing] variety is the realization that other beings are [also] endowed with the sugata heart in their m ind streams, which is called “omniscience.” [However, this omniscience] does not refer to knowing the mistakenness of seeming [reality]. For, the mistakenness of seeming [re­ality] does not exist in any respect among knowable objects. Therefore, it is not suitable as an object of the knowing and seeing of the noble ones because it does not exist as an object [in the first place].Others may say, “But then [this knowledge] is not omniscience because the entirety of seeming [reality] is not known [by it].” If there is no [seem­ing reality] to be assessed that represents an object of this knowledge, how could the very knowledge [of it] be feasible? To apprehend a nonexistent object is a conceptual wrong cognition, but omniscience is held to be with­out such conceptions.

If it did not exist, the (1) foundation of the path, (2) the nature of the path, and (3) the fruition of the path would not exist either, the entire dharma of the Bud­dha would be unnecessary, and his words about the extraordinary defini­tive meaning would represent the wheel of the genuine dharma that is of expedient meaning and deceiving. Hence, also [the tathágata hearts] finally being without stains—the Tathágata—exists. (1) W hen the foundation of the path is finely discriminated, it is the tathágata heart with stains that is the disposition that is undifferentiable from the expanse of all phenomena. The meaning of this is explained through the [Avatamsakasutras] example of a huge silken cloth [as big as] a trichiliocosm.2607 The [psychophysical] supports for accomplishing this [disposition] are the persons who engage it through the three yânas, but those who engage in the principles of árávakas and pratyekabuddhas are very distant from this tathágata disposition.

If it did not exist, despite tathagatas coming to the world, there would be no foundation for the increase of roots of virtue and no basis for their arising. {29} (3) Con­sequently, perfect awakening would not be reached.Therefore, the permanent, enduring, and immutable refuge is that the disposition of the [three] jewels definitely exists within the ultimate dhar- makàya.

The difference between its phases of being with stains and with­out stainsTherefore, noble Asañga and his brother express the sugatahood that exists within the cocoon of the adventitious stains as “the sugata heart” and “the basic element that is the sugata heart.” They express the factor of its being suitable to become free from this [cocoon] as “the unfolding disposition” and “the dharmakaya that is in the process of fundamentally changing.” Its being free from the adventitious stains is expressed as “the Tathagata Bhagaván, the perfect Buddha.”26092.1.3.3. The m anner in which the stains do not come back again once one has become a buddhaAs for this sugata heart, which is included in the single same name through­out all three phases, after all clinging to real existence, clinging to the lack of real existence, and clinging to the freedom from reference points have become pure, {30} even the sugata heart itself will not be observed. There­fore, you may wonder whether this actuality is difficult to realize. It is not. It is certain that there is no fluctuation within the sugata heart, which has the nature of nothings being able to destroy it, because the sugata heart does not conceive of the element of the proximate afflictions. After it has become free from the obscurations once, how could there be any connec­tion of nature [between them]? Since there is no connection of dependence either, it will remain on the level of irreversibility.26102.1.3.4. The m anner in which the fruition is attained by virtue of two [factors]—the blessings of the buddhas after they have become buddhas and the power of the sugata heartTherefore, through having generated the power of the prajñá of the noble ones with regard to the tathagata heart that is ultimate reality, the knots of discriminating [thinking] are undone. Thus, [these noble ones] recognize the tathagata wisdom and become tathagatas. At that point, through their teaching the path [to others], they put an end to all fetters of the discrimi­nating [thinking] of ordinary beings.2611"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"The Lam p That Excellently Elucidates 817Though the body, speech, and m in d o f buddhas are beyond the adven­titious stains, the profound miracles of the body, speech, and m ind of bud­dhas are displayed for sentient beings, whose mind streams possess these adventitious stains. That certain [beings] to be guided see these miracles of the body, speech, and m ind of the [buddhas] is by virtue of the power of both the tathagatas’ compassion of blessing, emanating, and transforming the adventitious seeming [reality of sentient beings] through their having gained mastery over powerful ultimate reality and the tathagata hearts of those to be guided, whose m ind streams are endowed with the tathagata heart. {31} [Through this,] even ordinary beings are able to realize the m ir­acles of the bhagavans, the indestructible vajra points.Therefore, the tathagata heart’s being pure of stains, which is its own specific nature or specific characteristic, [is expressed as] “the tathagata heart free from adventitious stains.” Its general nature or characteristic of being equal in its profundity and vastness to the dharmadhatu is expressed as “the natural tathagata heart.”26122.2.

However, unsurpassable completely perfect buddhas, through knowing the entirety of how all phenomena without exception actually are and how they appear, clearly realize the basic nature, ultimate reality, {32} as being the páramitás of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self.2613 On the other hand, they clearly realize the ways in which [phe­nomena] appear—the adventitious elements of seeming sentient beings—as being impermanent, suffering, without self, and impure. Through these two modes [of realization], they eliminate the extremes of permanence and ex­tinction. This is because tathagatas [on the level] of seeming [reality] are primordially nonexistent, while ultimate reality—the tathagata heart that does not fall into any extremes or confines of seeming [reality]—exists.26142.2.1.2. The m anner in which it is not reasonable if it is not accepted as anything whatsoeverW ithout understanding this meaning, some who flatter themselves as being Madhyamikas do not accept [the sugata heart] as being either existent or nonexistent even on [the level of] the mere seeming during the phase of accomplishing the accumulation of merit through the illusion-like cogni­tions of the subsequent [attainment that follows] having risen from resting in meditative equipoise in the ultimate, the sugata heart. This is a dishon­est view. The great Madhyamika, venerable Asanga, holds that it is a view mixed with dialectics [as opposed to being grounded in personally and di­rectly experienced wisdom].26152.2.1.3. Teaching the páramitás of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and selfFurthermore, the meaning of the ultimate, the sugata heart, being the páramitás of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self is as follows. As for the meaning of [these four] being called “páramitá,” in order to coun­teract trifling and partial [notions] of referring to the tathagata heart as being nothing but supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self, it is referred to as “the páramitás of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self.” This is asserted as its having the character of the all-pervasiveness that is beyond all partiality. {33}In brief, [the meaning of supreme purity is that] the pure ultimate is completely pure by nature (its general [characteristic]) and [completely pure] by virtue of being without stains (its specific [characteristic]). Since it"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 819is liberated from [all reference points of] a self and the lack of a self, it bears the meaning of the supreme self. The meaning of its being supreme bliss is that it is free from all factors that represent the agitating fluxes of body and mind and exist from [the state of] an ordinary being up through the end of the continuum of the tenth bhümi. The meaning of [its being supreme] permanence is to neither cling to the impermanent deceiving world nor solely conceive of permanent nirvána.26162.2.1.4. The m anner of exactly this being the definitive meaning that is the intention of [all] sütras and tantrasThose who do not understand this meaning and yet flatter themselves as being Mádhyamikas say, “That which is emptiness is beyond being an ob­ject of the present minds of ordinary beings.”2617 However, through m ak­ing [unwarranted] assumptions about that [statement] as having a meaning that comes down to mere words, they arrive at [an emptiness that is] a nonexistent phenomenon that is in contradiction to all presentations of seeming [reality]. Through taking [this kind of emptiness] as their mental object, they say, “This is the supreme Madhyamaka view.” Thus, it indeed appears that masters of Indian and Tibetan origin who are ordinary be­ings [commented on] the very vast sütras of definitive meaning, which the Tathágata himself [taught] to his eldest [bodhisattva] children, as entailing an intention. Also, with regard to the dharma principles that represent the páramitás of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self (which are not [to be taken] literally [but are of] definitive meaning), they comment on the meanings of the ultimate as being of expedient meaning. However, this is not good. For, as far as the meanings of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self go, {34} when the bodhisattvas (such as noble Avalokitesvara) who are the protectors of the three families2618 summarized the meaning of the tantras, they clarified it through these meanings. Also noble Nágárjuna and Asanga explained these meanings not just once.26192.2.2. Teaching it as being the nature of samsára and nirvána’s beinginseparableThis has three parts:1. Teaching it as being the nature of samsára and nirvána in general2. The manner of seeing the flaws of suffering and the qualities of happiness, when the sugata heart exists3. Teaching that this is the system of all Mádhyamikas"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"820 Translations2.2.2.1. Teaching it as being the nature of samsara and nirvana in general Therefore, the great Madhyamika, venerable Asanga, says that, in terms of the definitive meaning, samsara and nirvana are inseparable. He teaches that the objects of engagement of ordinary beings are “knowable objects” and [the subjects] that engage them are “cognitions.” The special object of engagement of the noble ones is the dharmadhatu, and [the subject] that engages it is the nature of phenomena. This meaning represents the same essential point as [speaking of] dharmadhatu wisdom. The dharmadhatu is what pervades the knowable objects and cognitions of ordinary beings. How­ever, despite its pervading them, it has absolutely no connection to them.You may wonder, “But then, what is the meaning of the regent Mai- treya’s ‘distinguishing between phenomena and their true nature within the mind streams of ordinary beings?” After having explained phenomena just in general as being the adventitious stains that consist of cognitions and knowable objects, he explains their true nature as the sugata heart. {35} However, he explains that this dharmadhatu, without conceiving of, or forming, anything among all phenomena2620 but operating as the nature of all of samsara and nirvana in the m anner of nonabiding, is not empty of the very dharmadhatu. Therefore, he asserts that once this is understood, samsara itself is nirvana.In this way, the noble ones are neither close to nor distant from sentient beings. They have absolutely no bond of being close to them since they have cut through the craving for a self, with which the basic elements2621 of all sentient beings are equally associated. Since they are not distant, through great compassion, they do not give up [any sentient being]. Therefore, through abiding neither closely nor distantly, the noble ones are the ones with the experiential sphere of equally not conceiving both samsara and nirvana, without any nirvana to be adopted or any samsara to be rejected. Therefore, it was already explained that “samsara and nirvana are insepara­ble” and that “samsara and nirvana are equality.”26222.2.2.2. The m anner of seeing the flaws of suffering and the qualities of happiness when the sugata heart existsYou may wonder, “Are the sugata heart and the adventitious stains thus different?” The Bhagavan said that if the sugata heart did not exist, ordi­nary beings would neither be weary of suffering nor wish and strive for nir­vana.2623 You may wonder, “Is it then the case that the sugata heart becomes weary of the adventitious stains or {36} do the adventitious stains them ­selves become weary of these adventitious stains?” Through the reality and"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 821the blessing of the unconditioned tathagata heart and of the natural purity of the dharmadhâtu, despite there being no causes and conditions since be- ginningless time, it is [initially and seemingly] the conditioned adventitious stains themselves that, while [actually always] nonexistent, become weary of suffering and turn toward and aspire for nirvana. Later, it is through the light of wisdom arising from the tathagata heart that these adventitious stains are [actually] overcome. Therefore, this is [said] in the sense of what is adventitious, conditioned, and lacks causes and conditions being m utu­ally impermanent.26242.2.2.3. Teaching that this is the system of all MadhyamikasOn this, others who flatter themselves as being Madhyamikas say, “Condi­tioned phenomena that lack causes and conditions are not even justified on [the level of] seeming [reality].” In this case, [my reply is as follows]. While you Madhyamikas accept a clearly manifest sprout that has arisen [from a seed] as being conditioned, when you apply analysis, you assert that it is established in mere dependence without there being any [really existent] causes or conditions. So, if [you assert that, it is not different from what is said] here. For, though all seeming phenomena lack causes and conditions, they still appear in a dreamlike manner. [Some] may wonder here, “Dream appearances do have causes and conditions—it is ones own latent tenden­cies that serve as the conditions for [minds] operating while being asleep.” W ith the entirety of these latent tendencies themselves and the âlaya-con- sciousness as the support into which they are planted lacking causes and conditions, they [simply] represent the appearance of all kinds of vortexes of being mistaken about naturally impure appearances, {37} just as none of the causes and conditions for [a ropes mistakenly appearing as] a snake are complete within the rope. This is what noble Asanga asserts.26252.3. The m anner of making efforts in the path of purifying its stains This has four parts:1. The need to rely on the path on a temporary level in order to be free from stains2. The basic nature of ground and fruition s being ultimately insepara­ble in their nature3. The manner in which mistakenness arises based on improper mental engagement during the phase of the ground4.

The need to rely on the path on a tem porary level in order to be free from stainsThough the adventitious stains lack causes and conditions, for as long as [the tathágata heart exists within the stains that represent] a sentient being, as the means for the tathágata hearts becoming free from these stains, the causes and conditions for purifying these stains must exist [too]. W ithout such causes and conditions’ being complete, [sentient beings] will not be­come perfect buddhas. It is on [the level of] this principle that they need to bring together an excellent accumulation of dependently originating [causes and conditions].Here, others may think, “If all appearances and imputations of ordi­nary beings are without causes and conditions, based on this [situation], even if they bring together the temporary dependent originations of causes and conditions, it is without purpose.” This is not the case. For, with the tathágata heart’s being the cause that is concordant with the essential char­acter of all causes and all conditions for the increase of the pure dharmas, it does not change into any other state [through beings’] bringing together the dependent originations of causes and conditions.2626 {38}Furthermore, [beings] need to make efforts in the continuum of the per­fect path that, at the point when tathágatahood becomes manifest, clearly manifests the dharmakàya, wisdom, and great compassion in their respec­tive distinct ways. Since the dharmakàya, wisdom, and great compassion are each fettered by their respective obscuring factors, these [distinct] ob­structions need to be eliminated. The cause2627 that is the path that clearly manifests [the dharmakàya and so on] is concordant with the tathágata heart and the dharmakàya—ultimately, they are inseparable. Therefore, all the qualities of relinquishment and realization of a tathágata s having m an­ifested [the path of] nonlearning are also inseparable from the tathágata heart.2628In addition, the nature of the kàya of a perfect buddha is the dhar- matàkàya. Here, the meaning of what is called “dharmakàya” is that which is able to demonstrate the empowering of all sentient beings to view perfect buddhahood, the genuine dharma, and the mother of the victors and that which, through joining this with all knowable objects in a nondual manner, represents almighty mastery over all phenomena. This is the meaning of the dharmakàya.2629 {39}"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 8232.3.2. The basic nature of ground and fruition’s being ultimately insepa­rable in their natureA [psychophysical] support that is specified through the relinquishment [of all obscurations] is called “completely perfect buddha” and a [psycho­physical] support with the obscurations, “sentient being.” However, in the mind streams of both of these, tathagatahood is neither better nor worse, nor does it increase or decrease. Furthermore, the Bhagavan said:Therefore, Sariputra, the basic element of sentient beings is not other and the dharmakaya is not other. Nothing but the basic element of sentient beings is the dharmakaya, and nothing but the dharmakaya is the basic element of sentient beings. In terms of their meaning, they are not two. They are different in letter only.2630Here, it appears that some explain that the element that consists of the adventitious stains of sentient beings is one with the dharmakaya of the tathagata heart, but this is not the case.2631 [With regard to the above quote,] it is explained that “the basic element” in “the basic element of sentient beings” represents the basic element in the mind streams of sentient beings that is equivalent to the disposition and the sugata heart at the time of the ground. It is explained to be the same as the dharmakaya at the time of the fruition. This meaning refers to the essential character of the [buddha] qualities being sugatahood, about which venerable Maitreya said:Its true nature of being changeless Is the same before as after.2632Here, also noble and venerable Asanga explains that, in this system, what is the purity of sentient beings {40} and the mind of proper [mental engagement] are inseparable. He says that the mind that faces the nature of phenomena and is not different from it is not different from the natural nature of phenomena, the sugata heart, which does not abide in any phenomenon whatsoever.2.3.3. The m anner in which mistakenness arises based on im proper m ental engagement during the phase of the ground[Asanga] also holds that, under the sway of not relying on what purifies the mind, the impure skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, karmas, and afflictions are gradually established. However, from the very beginning, the factors to be"},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"824 Translationsrelinquished and their remedies dwell in the m ind stream of each person as opposites.The explanation of the natural sugata heart’s being without causes and conditions is given through the example of space.2633 As for the meaning of this, it is explained [as being space-like] because [the sugata heart] is not established as a collection, an assembly, or an aggregation, due to which there is no clinging to its arising or ceasing whatsoever. However, in its own nature, it exists as a cause. Just as space exists as the support that provides room [for everything else], the tathágata heart, by virtue of existing as the basic nature of all phenomena, is held [by Asanga] to be established as not being different from a cause.2634Furthermore, ordinary beings making efforts in the means to see the sugata heart that they have not seen before and [noble bodhisattvas] resting in meditative equipoise in the aspects [of the sugata heart] that they have seen before are both not erroneous. However, once [bodhisattvas] have at­tained the fifth bhumi, both [making efforts in seeing what has not been seen before and resting in what has been seen before] are controlled by the power of the mind. Therefore, by virtue of this point, bodhisattvas from this stage onward {41} gain mastery over its not being contradictory for them to simultaneously enter and rise from many inconceivable gates of displaying samádhi and prajňá with regard to both afflicted and purified phenomena. This is an ancillary point.26352.3.4. Explaining the three káyas by way of awakening into the nature of the sugata heart when passing into nirvanaFurthermore, that [the sugata heart] resides in the fundamental nature of all sentient beings means that, [in actual fact,] they have primordially passed into nirvana, thus not needing to pass into nirvana later. However, [the expression] “sentient beings’ having passed into nirvana” is held [to mean] that what makes up the mental states or the mind of a sentient being have passed into said primordial nirvana in the manner of naturally not abiding [in it].2636[In this vein,] the body and the mind of an ordinary being that have passed into nirvana [are asserted to] represent the nirmánakáya. Through the impurities of the [body and the m ind of an ordinary being’s] having fundamentally changed, this is the káya that appears to all higher and lower ordinary beings. Ultimate reality, the svábhávikakáya, and tathágatahood blend into each other as one taste, so what is the káya of one victor is the káya of all [victors]. Therefore, this is [asserted as] the sambhogakáya. Since"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 825this is the basic nature of everything in samsara and nirvana, the tathagata heart, it is asserted as the dharmakaya.As for what liberation is, liberation [means] to have attained the mas­tery of self-aware wisdom over the sugata heart of ones own mind stream. However, the clinging to a self becoming the lack of a self does not repre­sent liberation—to be liberated merely through a nonexistent {42} would be similar to [being liberated through] the horns of a rabbit and so on.26372.4. Teaching the manner in which the stains obscure this heart through examplesThis has three parts:1. Explaining this through linking it with the nine examples as de­scribed in the Uttaratantra2. Explaining it through linking it with master Nágárjunas Dharma- dhatustava and the Kalacakra[tantra]3. Teaching that the basic nature is not realized and ignorance cannot be relinquished solely through emptiness [in the sense of] the lack of real existence2.4.1. Explaining this through linking it with the nine examples as de­scribed in the UttaratantraThe definitive meaning of the maháyána that is described in this way in the final wheel [of dharma] is summarized by venerable Ajita [in his Uttaratan­tra through] nine examples and their nine meanings.2638 As for the meaning of these, ordinary beings with great desire who have not met tathágatas before, through all their afflictive obscurations, do not manifest even a frac­tion of the tathagata heart that is their share in their mind streams, but it abides in the cocoon of these afflictions. However, through their having ac­cumulated a little bit of roots of virtue and thus giving rise to the aspiration for awakening, just a partial fraction [of their tathagata hearts] becomes free from the obscuring [afflictions]. Therefore, this point is described as the tathagata hearts becoming manifest in a part of the mind stream of an ordinary being.2.4.2. Explaining it through linking it with master Nágárjuna’s D harm a- dhatustava and the Kdlacakra[tantra]In his Dharmadhatustava, the noble master [Nágárjuna] speaks about this point in detail through the example of a lamp inside a vase, and he also discusses it through the example of the waxing moon.2639 In the"},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"826 TranslationsKalacakra[tantra/, {43} it is explained that [certain] aspects of wisdom in the triad of body, speech, and mind and the triad of nadls, vayus, and ti- lakas appear in [certain] coarse parts of the mind streams of ordinary be­ings.2640 Thus, this profound point is not [found] in other [sources] without the instructions transmitted from noble Asanga.Therefore, what liberates from the cocoon of the afflictions depends on the state of mind of having faith in the sugata heart through striving for it. This state of mind arises in a self-arisen manner, and its arising is the object of those with supreme fortune.2641 This principle is confirmed by what I say in my Statement o f Realization:Even if you exert yourself for eons of years,If you do not realize the self-lucidity that is the essential point,A time of nirvana is impossible.2.4.3. Teaching that the basic nature is not realized and ignorance can­not be relinquished solely through emptiness [in the sense of] the lack of real existenceTherefore, some who have induced certainty about the ultimates being mere nonconceptuality explain emptiness as the lack of real existence. However, this is not correct. [For,] in that case, one would not be able to clearly realize the expanse of tathagata wisdom. If you wonder why, the mere nonconceptuality about the aspects of seeming [reality] and the mere emptiness of a real existence that is other in substance is also seen by sra­vakas and pratyekabuddhas,2642 but it is difficult in any case for sravakas and pratyekabuddhas to realize even a mere fraction of the sugata heart.In order to avoid the flaws of this point, others assert that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the realization of phenomenal identitylessness and say, “There is no difference between sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and the mahayana with regard to the Madhyamaka view of the freedom from reference points. {44} However, in dependence on the extensiveness or conciseness, respectively, of the reasonings for ascertaining this freedom from reference points, the extent to which the nature of the freedom from reference points [is realized differs], but there is no difference in terms of its being profound and not profound, respectively.” In this way, there were many in India and Tibet who were putting down the fully complete teach­ing of the Buddha through giving [undue] importance to [just] a [certain] part of it.2643"},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"The Lamp That Excellently Elucidates 827The reason why the meaning of what has been said is difficult to realize is that the tathágata heart is the very heart of the dharmakáya. Therefore, the heart of the m undane is the supramundane, the heart of the supra- mundane is the heart of the [supramundane] dharmas, and the heart of the [supramundane dharmas] is the tathágata heart.2644 Thus, noble Asañga, [our] refuge, holds that this is difficult to be realized by others. Hence, this [tathágata heart] is seen a little bit by bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi. If you wonder what their m anner of seeing [the tathágata heart] is, [they see it] in the manner of seeing that the entirety of samsára and nirvána is not different from tathágata wisdom. As for this seeing of samsára and nirvána s not being different, in this system, they are asserted as not being different [from the perspective of] the tathágata heart.2645 However, others present this as seeing [samsára and nirvána] as not being different from the perspective of the mere aspect of [their] emptiness. But [Asañga and so on] hold that, through seeing that [samsára and nirvána] are merely not different [in terms of both being] emptiness, one is not able to eradicate the latent tendencies of ignorance. W hy is that? Because even srávakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the seeing that, just as their own lack of a self is empty, the [imaginary] self of other beings is emptiness too.26462.5.

The actual teaching on the purposeYou may think, “By virtue of this point [made above], if [the sugata heart] is not [even] an object of the great bodhisattvas who have attained the bhümis, it is absolutely not the sphere of ordinary beings.”2647 There is no flaw here—[the sugata heart] is taught in order to awaken the disposition and in order to relinquish the five flaws of ordinary beings.2648 After it was mainly explained [in the second turning of the wheel of dharma] that all phenomena of seeming [reality] are empty (just like illusions, dreams, and clouds), it is taught [here] that the remainder—the tathágata heart, which is not empty of the heart of the unsurpassable dharmas—exists.2649"},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"828 Translations2.5.2.

Teaching an answer by way of [the absurd consequence of] not needing to relinquish the five flaws if [the sugata heart] were of expedi­ent meaningHere, some scholars of the Land of Snows assert that the statement in the Uttaratantra about the tathagata hearts existence in all sentient beings is of expedient meaning. [If you wonder] why, [they say that this statement] was made for a [certain] purpose, that is, in order to relinquish the five flaws. However, in this case, [beings] would not have to relinquish these five flaws. It would not be a flaw when one has contempt for inferior beings. That is, the tathagata heart would not exist in sentient beings and, in actual fact, there would be no purpose in taking up the dharma of the tathagata heart, [since] it is of expedient meaning. Nor would it be a flaw to deny the dhar- makáya (the sugata heart). For, [through denying] something that does not exist in the first place, {46} one would not fall in the extreme of denial and thus would [properly] express the actual mode of being. It would also be appropriate to be fainthearted. For the sugata heart does not exist in ones own m ind stream, and therefore any appearance of the cognitive mode of not being fainthearted [with regard to attaining buddhahood] would be a cognitive [mode] that is not grounded in what the facts are.26502.5.2.2.

For, in this system [of Asafiga] here, the dharmas that were taught by the Bhagavan Maitreya and so on, [which according to those scholars entail certain] purposes and invalidations of [what they teach] ex­plicitly, are commented on as not entailing an intention.

Based on [this difference], in the manner of spoon-feeding children, the first wheel of the words of the Buddha [causes] renunciation of samsara, the middle one puts an end to clinging to characteristics, and the last one distinguishes well the actuality of the basic nature [in terms of] existing, nonexisting, being, nonbeing, and so on. Therefore, the first one is of expedient meaning, the second one is a mix of expedient and831"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"832 Translationsdefinitive meanings, and the final one is the unsurpassable definitive mean­ing. [This is how] it is established through the scriptural [source] that is the Samdhinirmocanasütra.2660 For not only are we unable to step over this and other such presentations by the victor and his children, but this is also established through the direct perception of profound actuality’s becom­ing progressively clearer and perfectly complete. Nevertheless, the second [wheel] teaches the way in which the seeming appears [by identifying] what does not exist as being [in fact] nonexistent {180} and the final [wheel] teaches the way in which the ultimate is empty [by identifying] what ex­ists as being [in fact] existent. Therefore, [Ratnàkara]sànti and others assert that both the middle and the final [wheels] as well as the two great chario­teers [Nàgàrjuna and Asanga] who were the founders of the systems that are [based on] these two [wheels] have the same platform of intention.[The system] that is based on the twenty sütras of the heart of the defin­itive meaning in the last wheel, the five dharmas of Maitreya, and the texts of Nàgàrjuna, Asanga, and their successors is known in this land of Tibet as Shentong Madhyamaka since [the time of] the pair that consisted of the translator Su [Gawé Dorje] and Dsen [Kawoché] up to the present. Among its various traditions of explaining and listening that arose, the three great system-founding charioteers are the All-Knowing Rangjung Dorje, the Omniscient Dôlpopa, and the Omniscient Trimé Oser.2661 Also, the sev­enth lord,2662 Silung Panchen,2663 Tàranàtha, Denpé Nyinjé,2664 and others, who definitely dwelled on the bhùmis of the noble ones and were endowed with the dharma eyes of the impartial spiritual friends of the fully perfect teaching, determined [this system] through the triad of study, explanation, and meditation, and all their discourses became supports of this [system]. Moreover, the final intention of [all] noble beings who unmistakenly see the basic nature through the union of study, reflection, and meditation m ust come down to nothing but this.1.2. Specific [source]As for the specific profound guiding instructions on the view, there are two [systems]: (1) the system of the common guiding instructions on the view in which lord Maitrlpa emphasized the intended meaning of the Uttaratan­tra and that was transmitted through the great pillar of Central [India], Ratnavajra, the Kashmiri Sajjana, and so on, and (2) the Kagyü [system] bestowed upon venerable [Marpa] from Lhotra through the path of giving the empowerment of transferring blessings—the uncommon Mahàmudrà"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 833of the union of sütra and m antra that is known to everyone. Among these, it is the former that is to be explained here. {181}2. The actual guiding instructions on the view This has two parts:1. The sütra system as it stands on its own feet2. The manner in which this is connected to the profound system of mantra2.1. The sütra system as it stands on its own feet This has two parts:1. W hat is to be understood2. The manner in which this is made a living experience2.1.1. W hat is to be understoodTrust in causes and results being undeceiving is taught to be the correct view of worldly people, which is taken as the basis [here]. On top of that, one needs to rely on an unmistaken profound view that makes one go be­yond the three realms. In that regard, srávakas familiarize with personal identitylessness; pratyekabuddhas, with the lack of real existence of the ap­prehended; Yogácáras, with wisdom empty of the duality [of apprehender and apprehended]; and common Madhyamikas, with the meaning of hav­ing determined all phenomena to be empty of any essence of their own. Through that, they [all] make [their individual] experiences. However, due to being ensnared by the triad of mistaken minds, discriminations, and views, they do not determine nondual wisdom and thus find themselves in places far away from buddhahood.You may wonder, “So who does experience nondual wisdom?” The [nondual wisdom] that actually fulfills this definition is seen by the wisdom of the noble ones and the one that is concordant, by those ordinary beings who have purified their mind streams through uncommon study, reflec­tion, and meditation. The latter are twofold.(1) The Nihsvabhávavádins [first] resolve through the five great Madh- yamaka reasonings that all phenomena from form up through the knowl­edge of all aspects, just like the horns of a rabbit and the son of a barren woman, are emptiness in that they are neither observable as anything nor established as anything in terms of the basic nature, with [this emptiness] appearing as dependent origination and dawning in an unimpeded manner."},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"834 Translations[During] the main practice, just as both a rubbing stick and the [wooden] support to rub it against are consumed by the fire [they produced] and the fire itself also disappears on its own in the end, after clinging thoughts have been evaluated by discriminating [thoughts], discriminating prajñá itself settles into being unobservable. W hen [these Nihsvabhávavádins], with­out thinking of it as anything or mentally engaging in it as anything, {182} meditate within the state of the space-like realization of identitylessness in the m anner of not meditating, many samádhi doors of the union of calm abiding and superior insight (such as the Jewel Lamp)2665 arise. At that time, if they recognize [this state] well through pure scriptures and pith instruc­tions, after their mistaken modes of apprehending have become pure, their prajñá takes a leap, so that they will realize the view of the uncommon Great Madhyamaka. However, the Samádhisambháraparivarta says:Ones samádhi may be stable [But] if one entertains clinging to it,It is called “the behavior of children”And nirvana will not be attained.2666Therefore, some who flatter themselves by taking their experiences of emptiness [at which they arrive through conceptual] examination and analysis to be the true nature of phenomena [and say] “The Great Madhyamaka is like ours alone but all others are wrong” deviate [from emptiness and mistake it as] the path. Some do not become liberated in [mind s] own essence that is beyond m ind but simply count the arising and ceasing [of minds moments]. Mistaking that for being Mahámudrá, they deviate from [emptiness as] the fundamental ground of stable experience. Apart from the greater or lesser degrees to which they [merely] analyze names, both are equal in not being able to transcend the three realms. Hence, to enter the door to omniscient wisdom, through rock meeting bone2667 [in the sense of] unmistakenly understanding, experiencing, and realizing scriptures, reasonings, and pith instructions, one needs to strike the essential points of the view, meditation, and conduct that are not contradictory to anything and yet are more eminent than anything.(2) As for the Yogácáras, who rely on the [five] dharmas of Maitreya, it is best if they engage in the preliminaries of cutting through the refer­ence points of the adventitious appearances of mistakenness (the bearers of the nature of phenomena) through the scriptural system of the middle wheel of the words of the Buddha together with the commentaries on its"},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 835intention. {183} If they are not able [to deal with] that much elaboration, they must definitely train in the five dharmas of Maitreya or at least the Uttaratantra. If they are not even able to do that, [they should contemplate what the M ahdydnasutrdlamkdra] says:The mind is aware that nothing other than mind exists.Then it is realized that mind does not exist either.The intelligent ones are aware that both do not existAnd abide in the dharmadhatu, in which these are absent.2668Accordingly, since beginningless [time], based on the adventitious stains that are the factor of being ignorant about one’s own mind and from the perspective of no examination and no analysis, [one’s own mind] appears as all kinds of [delusive subjects and objects], just like the mistaken [appearances] in a dream. However, if analyzed, since they are not established as anything whatsoever but are empty of any essence of their own, all appearances are the magical creations of mind alone. Therefore, that the apprehended, emerging as if it were outer referents, appears and yet is without any nature of its own (like [a reflection of] the moon in water) is the basic nature of seeming reality. Also the mind that is the apprehender does not abide anywhere on the outside or the inside, nor is it established as any entity of shape or color. The eight collections [of consciousness] together with their [various] elements that arise from the continuum of clinging to an identity—being mistaken about what does not exist [through treating it] as if it existed—are primordially empty, just like a flower in the sky. However, to correctly realize the wisdom empty of the duality of apprehender and apprehended—the nature of phenomena that pervades everybody from buddhas to sentient beings, the sugata heart, the natural luminosity that is primordially never tainted by adventitious stains, the basic nature of ultimate reality—and then to rest in meditative equipoise within it is the intention of the [five] dharmas of Maitreya.One must engage in [at least] that much analysis as a preliminary, and it is thus that the freedom from [all] extremes is determined. Thereafter, what is called “making union a living experience” refers to dwelling in the natural state of the basic nature, self-arising wisdom. {184} The manner of being empty [is called] “being empty of thoughts of clinging to any extremes of reference points.” The m anner of realization is called “realization through personally experienced wisdom.”"},{"pageNumber":852,"pageContent":"836 Translations2.1.2.

PreliminariesAccording to the progression of purifying the coarse, subtle, and very sub­tle stains of the sugata heart, which is like a wish-fulfilling jewel, in agree­m ent with the first wheel [of dharma], you need to reflect and meditate as [described] in the [four] synopses of the dharma.2670 Thus, reflect as fol­lows. (1) The end of being born is death. The end of coming together is separation. The end of accumulating is the exhaustion [of what was accu­mulated]. The end of rising is falling. [Thus,] all these conditioned phe­nomena are even more impermanent than bubbles and lightning. (2) Based on being appropriated through karma and afflictions, the five skandhas such as form circle in, and fall into, the three realms, just like flies caught in ajar. This [circling] has the nature of suffering, is moved through suffering, and is trapped in suffering. (3) Since all seeming phenomena from form up through the knowledge of all aspects are not really established, they are empty. (4) The great perfect [nature] that represents the identitylessness of the duality of apprehender and apprehended is the basis that is empty of all phenomena and is beyond the misery2671 of adventitious mistakenness—is the supreme permanence, eternity, and peace. [While reflecting like this,] verbally recite the following again and again:Everything conditioned is impermanent.What is contaminated is suffering.All phenomena are empty and identityless.Nirvana is peace.You should gain certainty [about this] in detail [through] blending the common preliminaries that appear in [the texts on] the stages of the path2672 with your mind stream.2.1.2.2.

Cultivate longing devotion. If you have determined the view previously through study and reflection, recollect that view and then rest in meditative equipoise.

Then, be neither distracted to the outside, nor tightened up on the inside, nor hold on [to anything] in between. W ithout losing yourself in neutral and indifferent states, rest spaciously, like the sky. If [your mind] does not stay put through that but moves, since any appearances of the six collections [of consciousness] that emerge are emptiness, when you sustain [minds] own peacefulness and self-liberation without engaging in adopt­ing or rejecting, hope or fear, and accomplishing or blocking, the signs of m inds being still will gradually occur.Then, through searching for the m ind2676 as found in the guiding m an­uals, the resolve that its nature is primordially free from reference points arises. Since there is nothing to meditate on apart from solely recogniz­ing this basic nature free from reference points, rely on the mindfulness of [simply] not being separate [from this recognition]. This is also taught as being uncontrived, being fresh, and whatever is emerging being the natural state. Therefore, no matter how your own lucid and empty m ind without grasping may appear, be it still, moving, joyful, or sad, sustain just that in an uncontrived manner. Other than that, without becoming fettered by any efforts in terms of factors to be relinquished and their remedies, let the basic awareness (rigpa) that is without foundation and on which one can­not meditate rest.2677 Through that, the ultimate [union] of calm abiding and superior insight of the mahayana takes place. No matter how [certain] avenues of experiences and [certain] qualities of the path may arise during the phases of these [steps of calm abiding and superior insight], you should recognize their own essence without being attached or clinging [to them]. This is the profound essential point. {187}Verbally, you should recite the following and remember its mean­ing: “The basis is emptiness. The path is signlessness. The fruition is wishlessness.”2.1.2.2.3.

But if you do not have that, at least the reading transmission of [Dolpopa’s] M ountain D harm a— The Ocean o f the Definitive M eaning should be given [to you], and [based on that text] you should realize the view as well as you can. Through that, you will comprehend that though mind’s essence is taught through m any synonyms (such as “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects,” “natural luminosity,” “the tathagata heart,” “suchness,” “emptiness,” “M ahamudra,” and “AHAM”), [doing so] is untouched by any flaw of contradiction. Thus, you will be free from flaws as expressed [by the following words]:Emptiness and identitylessness are taught in all the discourses of the Buddha. Foolish people who do not understand the meaning of empti­ness and identitylessness will be ruined.Then, through relying on the two realities and the four reliances,2678 the ultimate definitive meanings of the discourses of the victor and the wisdom to be experienced by you will communicate and thereby your cultivation of the path will become meaningful.Thus, all phenomena that consist of the imaginary adventitious m ind are empty, just like a gathering of clouds. However, the nature of phenomena (the sugata heart that is an uninterrupted stream of lucid awareness) is to be made a living experience through recognizing it as self-arising wisdom. [To do so, start by taking] refuge and [generating bodhi]citta as above. As found in the discourses of Jetsiin Taranatha, cultivate the recollection of the guru’s being a buddha for one session, and at the end [recite]:The Tathagata is indemonstrable. He cannot be seen with the eyes. The dharma is inexpressible. {188} It cannot be heard with the ears. The samgha is unconditioned. It cannot be worshipped with body, speech, or mind.2679And:Since the nature of the Buddha is unconditioned, it is called “perma­nent.” What is called “space” is the nature of the Buddha. The nature of the Buddha is the Tathagata. The Tathagata is unconditioned. What is unconditioned is permanent. Permanent is the dharma. The dharma is the samgha. The samgha is unconditioned. What is unconditioned is permanent."},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"840 TranslationsReciting this again and again, always recollect the ultimate three jewels. Then, [contemplate the following verses] from the Lankâvatàrasütra:By relying on mere mind,One does not imagine outer objects.By relying on nonappearance,One should go beyond mere mind.By relying on the focal object of actual reality,One must go beyond nonappearance.If yogins rest in nonappearance,They do not see the mahâyâna.2680[Thus,] the realization that the mistakenness of the seeming is mere mind is scrutinized by the Madhyamaka without appearances. Going beyond even that, you must engage in the unmistaken way of being of true reality through the Madhyamaka with appearances. Here, you may wonder, “W hat is the focal object of actual reality?” Just as there are no four elements that are not pervaded by space, there are no knowable objects that are not pervaded by the dharmakàya of buddhas. {189} Also, in the suchness of buddhas, oneself, and all sentient beings, there are no distinctions of good and bad, big and small, high and low, and so on. Furthermore, the naturally abiding disposition or the basic element that is able to produce the buddha attributes and has been obtained through the nature of phenomena since beginningless time2681 exists in all living beings who consist of the life-force breath. Therefore, all sentient beings possess the tathàgata heart. In order to bring that to mind clearly, recite [Uttaratantra 1.28]:Since the perfect buddhakâya radiates,Since suchness is undifferentiable,And since the disposition exists,All beings always possess the buddha heart.The dharmakàya of those who are pure, the suchness of those who are [both] impure and pure, and the disposition of those who are impure exist in the following manner:A buddha in a decaying lotus, honey amid bees,Kernels in their husks, gold in filth,"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 841A treasure in the earth, a sprout and so on [from] a small fruit,A statue of the victor in a rotten garment,The lord of humans in the belly of a lowly woman,And a precious image in clay—just as these exist,This basic element dwells in sentient beings,Obscured by the adventitious stains of the afflictions.2682{190} Recite this and reflect on its meaning.Everything that is separable, such as karma, causes and results, [kar­mic] maturations, afflictions, skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, and dependent origination, has not only never existed ultimately but even on the level of the seeming, [the tathagata heart] abides such that it is [merely] associated [with these phenomena] but is never tainted [by any of them]. [By con­trast,] the inseparable buddha attributes that exceed the sand grains in the river Gariga in number, such as the self-arisen major and m inor marks, the powers, the fearlessnesses, the threefold foundation of mindfulness,2683 great love and compassion, and immeasurable samadhis (such as the vajra-like one) and wisdoms (such as dharmadhatu [wisdom]), are present in an intrinsic and primordial manner. Therefore, [the tathagata heart] is not empty [of them]. W ith trust in the ground that is suitable to be freed from the stains and is suitable for the qualities to arise, bring the following clearly to mind:The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.It possesses all the buddha attributes,Which are luminous, unproduced,Manifesting in an inseparable manner,And beyond the sands of the river Gariga [in number].2684Furthermore, sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and others view bliss as suffering; what is permanent, as impermanent; what is a self, as the lack of a self; and what is pure, as impure. They do not understand the meaning to be understood from the words spoken by the victor. {191} The meaning of this as follows. W hat lacks a self is called “samsara.” W hat is called"},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":"842 Translations“self’ is the Tathagata. W hat is impermanent refers to the ¿ravakas and pratyekabuddhas. W hat is permanent is the dharmakaya of the Tathagata. Suffering refers to all tlrthikas. Bliss refers to parinirvana. Impurity refers to conditioned dharmas. Purity refers to the perfect dharmas of buddhas and bodhisattvas. Your own mind as such—the sugata heart—is endowed with these four perfect dharmas that are beyond mistakenness. Thinking this, bring the following clearly to mind:Because the [dharmakaya] is naturally pureAnd because it is free from latent tendencies, it is pure.It is the supreme self because the reference points Of self and no-self are at peace.It is bliss because the skandha of a mental nature And its causes have come to an end.It is permanent because it is realized As the equality of samsara and nirvana.2685At present, the sugata heart (the basis of such distinctive features) that is endowed with the many qualities of freedom of a buddha (the distinctive features) is the self-aware wisdom that is lucid and unceasing, is the innate natural state, and is experienced through the triad of studying, reflecting, and meditating. Precisely this is what abides as the basis of purification. After what is to be purified—the adventitious stains—has become pure, the result of purification—nothing but this basic nature that abides within you—becomes manifest.2686 This {192} is labeled as “the dharmakaya free from stains.” Though it arises as all aspects of the entirety of samsara and nirvana, from the very moment of the arising [of these aspects], they do not move away from that ground, just as various kinds of reflections appear in a stainless crystal ball, but from the very mom ent of their appearing, the crystal and the reflections [in it] do not blend. Likewise, no matter how the appearances of the triad of samsara, nirvana, and the path may dawn within the lucid and empty self-awareness that is stripped bare, they are self-arising and self-liberated, never tainting the essence [of this awareness]. Therefore, with there being no latent tendencies of views and flaws to be removed and there being no need to newly add any distinctive features that did not exist before, the wisdom of the noble ones rests in meditative equipoise in emptiness. Making this your main practice, cultivate it during as many"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 843sessions as is suitable, and sometimes bring it clearly to mind through the following vajra words:There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is viewed as it really is—If actual reality is seen, one is liberated.2687Recite this or reflect on its meaning. These [words] are also what venerable Jetsiin Taranatha has given as an instruction on the profound essential point:If the pair of familiarizing with the sugata heart (the nature)And reflecting on the qualities of a victor (its distinctive features)Are brought together by a mind free from thoughts,This is the supreme path of the sugata—the definitive meaning.{193} Having rested in meditative equipoise in this way, at the end [contemplate] the following statement:Its true nature of being changeless Is the same before as after.2688Accordingly, when this naturally luminous sugata hearts own face that abides in you primordially and intrinsically has become manifest after the adventitious stains have been overcome through the correct view and meditation, it is labeled with the name of the result—“fully perfect awakening.” Thus, develop the certainty of trusting in the cause that is the path endowed with that [result]:Spoken of as luminous by nature [but] having been obscured by the thick cloud banks Of adventitious afflictive and cognitive [obscurations], just as the sun and the sky,Buddhahood is endowed with all the stainless buddha qualities and is permanent, everlasting, and eternal.It is attained based on the two wisdoms that are nonconceptual about [all] phenomena and discriminate them."},{"pageNumber":860,"pageContent":"844 TranslationsWithout beginning, middle, and end, undifferentiable,Nondual, freed [in] three [ways], stainless, and nonconceptual—This is the nature of the dharmadhátu, which is seen By yogins in the meditative equipoise of realizing it.2689Having developed such certainty, rise from your meditative equipoise.2.I.2.3. Subsequent attainm entW hen you engage in the activities of the periods between sessions, have dharmakáya devotion to the guru,2690 who excellently teaches the pith in­structions on the heart of the matter. Also, have the universal pure out­look of knowing that since all sentient beings possess the tathágata heart, apart from temporarily not recognizing or recognizing their own essence, {194} they ultimately have the character of the sixty-four qualities [of free­dom and maturation]. Have unbearable compassion for all those sentient beings who do not realize this—there is not even one who has not been your father and mother, and they keep circling only in the [vicious] cycle of suffering due to wandering around in an endless loop of appearances of mistakenness. Thus, in order that all sentient beings attain the dhar­makaya (the result of freedom that abides in their own ground), through being endowed with the generation of the maháyána [bodhi]citta of as­piration and application, relinquish your nonvirtues and those of others in [all] their parts through realizing that they are emptiness from the very start. Through being free from pride and a pretentious mind, accomplish as much virtue included in the páramitás (such as generosity) as you can. Through not clinging to yourself and sentient beings, practice benefiting sentient beings direcdy and indirectly as much as you can. Understand that all inner and outer dependently originating phenomena, which consist of the imaginary [nature], appear but are empty of any real essence, just like dreams and illusions.In particular, it is taught that, in those who have not gathered merit, many shortcomings such as wrong views arise, while one needs to gather the accumulations in order to realize the correct view. Therefore, dedicate the general virtuous actions that are free from wrongdoing and embraced by the generation of the maháyána [bodhi]citta up through [all particular virtues such as] prostrating, circumambulating, and offering clay images and butter lamps as the causes for seeing the tathágata heart. Through hav­ing trust in the permanent three jewels, generally accomplish what pleases them (such as making their representations, venerating them, and praising"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 845them) and, in particular, offer the seven-branch [prayer] without counting it but as much as you can.Sometimes, the reading transmission of the twenty sutras of the heart of the definitive meaning should be given to you. Also, recite them, reflect on their meaning, and explain them to others. {195} Think about authentic commentaries on the intention [of the final wheel of dharma], such as the Uttaratantra and M ountain D harm a— The Ocean o f the Definitive Meaning. W ithout letting study and reflection take away your meditation and with­out letting meditation overwhelm your study and reflection, you should unify the accumulation of wisdom during meditative equipoise in order to manifest the naturally abiding disposition and the accumulation of merit during subsequent attainment in order to make the unfolding disposition flourish further. Even if a little bit of the prajna of unmistakenly realizing the profound basic nature has arisen, since it covers so much more ground than inconceivable [amounts of] conditioned virtues, prioritize meditative equipoise. [On the other hand,] the greatness of the ultimate welfare of others if there is the study and reflection on the pure discourses of the vic­tor exceeds the arising of some semblance of samadhi hundreds or thou­sands of times. Therefore, you should not block the one by the other. In all your conduct, without being separated from mindfulness and alertness, you should be embraced by the two kinds of bodhicitta.W hen you die, you need to practice the manner of consciousness’s en­tering into ground luminosity according to the Omniscient Dolpopa’s very special pith instructions on the transference [of consciousness]. Therefore, you should [already] familiarize yourself with this from now on. In that way, through the awareness of the yogin’s becoming absorbed into the luminous emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects, the primordially present dharmakaya is liberated from the cocoon of the adventitious stains. Its character of very amazing, wonderful, consummate, immeasurable, and unfathomable kayas, wisdoms, and activities is as vast as space, and it serves as the source of [fulfilling] all desires of sentient beings, just like a wish-ful­filling tree of jewels. Thus, its permanent, all-pervasive, and effortless ac­tivity will arise in an uninterrupted manner for as long as samsara lasts. In order to accomplish such swiftly, during the breaks of your sessions, [make] the general mahayana dedications and aspirations, such as the [As­piration Prayer of] Excellent Conduct, and also make this following [aspira­tion prayer]: {196}"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"846 TranslationsFrom the Buddha [comes] the dharma and from the dharma, the noble samgha.From the samgha, the [tathagata] heart—the basic element of wisdom—is attained.Finally, the attainment of that wisdom is the attainment2691 of supreme awakening and so onThat is endowed with the attributes that promote the welfare of all sentient beings—may [I attain this].One’s own welfare and the welfare of others consist of the ultimate kayaAnd the seeming kaya that is based on it, respectively.May I swiftly attain the sixty-four qualitiesThat are the results of freedom and maturation.May I always engage without effort in an all-pervasive mannerIn the constitutions of those to be guided, the means to guide them,The activities of guidance that [suit] the constitutions of those to be guided,And in arriving at the [proper] place and time for this [activity].Through the virtue I obtained from having properly studied, reflected, and meditated on the seven topical points(The [three] jewels, the pure basic element, stainless awakening, the qualities, and activity),May [all] these beings behold the seer Amitayus endowed with infinite lightAnd, having seen him, attain supreme awakening by virtue of the stainless eye of dharma arising [in them].2692Thus, you should seal [your practice] through aspiration prayers without hope and fear, as well as dedications without thinking of the three spheres.2.2. The m anner in which this is connected to the profound system of m antraAt the time of making this very view a living experience through connect­ing it to the mantra [system], there are also two parts:1. W hat is to be understood2. Main practice"},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 8472.2.1. W hat is to be understoodThese appearances of the three existences (the container that is the outer world and the [inner] content [of sentient beings]), {197} just as a faces being transferred [as a reflection] into a mirror, appear as the magical dis­play of inner nadls, vayus, and tilakas, and these three abide as the aspects of “the other”—the circle of the supreme mandala with its support and supported.2693 All of these are true reality’s—the sugata hearts—own light and own radiance, the dharmakaya itself appearing as all aspects, and ut­terly changeless wisdom. This ultimate dharmadhatu, the union of bliss and emptiness, is unchanging in nature yet uninterrupted. Therefore, it is taught as having the meaning of “tantra.” Being the stained suchness during the phase of the ground, it is [called] “the causal tantra.” Since this actuality of the nature of phenomena appears gradually during the time of the path, it is [also called] “the path [or] method tantra.” W hen it has manifested as being endowed with twofold purity, it is called “the tantra of the completely pure fruition.” Let alone that those who cling to the m anner of the seeming’s being empty as being supreme do not even see a fraction of this uncommon view, it takes a long time [to realize this view] even through the above-mentioned path of the sutra system as it stands on its own feet. Therefore, when you rest in meditative equipoise in the six-branch vajra yoga that is more eminent than all [other] paths of mantra specified by empowerments and samayas, [this view] will be realized conveniently in a short time and with little hardships.2.2.2. M ain practice—making this a living experience The great commentary2694 says:Just as fire is always present in woodBut is not seen through the methods of cutting and splitting it,Through one’s hands rubbing a rubbing stick and a [wooden] support to rub it against,What is present in it will be seen,So mind’s luminosity is not seen {198}Through conceptual methods of meditation.It will be seen as such through joining The Lalana and Rasana as one."},{"pageNumber":864,"pageContent":"848 TranslationsAccordingly, this naturally luminous and utterly changeless wisdom is present in terms of its essence as the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects and [in terms of its] nature as utterly changeless great bliss. You do not see it through all kinds of meditations that entail thoughts. Rather, through the special methods of nonconceptual samádhi and control through [particular] activities, you will see it like a reflection in [mirror] divination. Therefore, in the beginning, through the [two] yogas of striving that are based on withdrawal and dhyána, [through the nocturnal yoga,] you will see the signs of smoke, mirages, fireflies, and lamps. Through the daytime yoga with a cloud-free sky, you will see [the signs] of a blazing [flame], the moon, the sun, Vajraráhu, and the highest elements [among these signs]— lightning up through the [great blue] sphere. Through resting in meditative equipoise day and night by taking the empty forms that are these fully complete ten signs as objects, there is an experience of the emptiness of all aspects appearing as entailing all aspects of the three realms. Then, based on the branches of prána dexterity (pranayam a) and retention, the bliss of melting is induced. Through [the branches of] recollection and samádhi, the ultimate utterly changeless bliss is accomplished. Through stopping the breath of the latent tendencies of transference, the mistaken appearances of the seeming are forcefully brought to an end, and thus unassailable pure appearances unfold without any limit or end. That is, this very dharmakáya free from stains, which is [endowed with] the páramitás of purity, self, bliss, and permanence, pervades [all of] space, and is the primal buddha present in oneself since the very start, {199} becomes manifest.2695 During these stages, the aids of samaya and pure conduct are necessary. Having understood the way of [practicing] this according to the discourses of the dharma lord and his successors as well as the pith instructions of the guru, you should familiarize with it in a one-pointed fashion.3. The benefitAt the end of [the age of] strife, since the five degenerations are rampant, the twenty-eight degenerations of the view arise. Since sentient beings have little merit, they have no respect for the sutra collection of the heart of the definitive meaning. Not only do they remain idle without familiarizing themselves with the meanings discussed in these [siitras], but some have wrong views due to lacking trust in the sutra collection of the heart [of the definitive meaning], which causes them to fall into the great abyss of the lower realms, which is taught as “the life-line of liberation being severed.”"},{"pageNumber":865,"pageContent":"Light Rays of the Stainless Vajra Moon 849The opposite of [all] this is the benefit [of these teachings]. The Ut­taratantra says that, compared to practicing eminent [forms of] generosity, discipline, and dhyana for many eons, the benefit of hearing this profound dharma is greater.2696 In general, the sutras say the following on the benefit of having faith in the mahayana:Whoever will give rise to faith in the mahayana will not wander into the lower realms for one thousand eons. For five thousand eons, they will not be born as animals and hungry ghosts. For twenty-five eons, they will be born in the worlds of the gods and the worlds of Brahma.2697[The sutras of] M other [Prajnaparamita] say that whoever has heard the prajnaparamita [teachings], upon dying and transiting, will go to the buddha realms and, for as long as living [there], will serve and honor all sentient beings with all [kinds of] pleasant items. Also, compared to hear­ing [the prajnaparamita teachings] for eons, to meditate on prajnaparamita even for the mere duration of a finger snap is of greater merit.2698In particular, the Samdhinirmocanasutra2699 says that if [the num ber of] particles on a finger nail and [the amount of] water in the hoofprint of an ox were proclaimed, [in comparison with the number of] particles on the great earth and {200} [the amount of] water in all four oceans, they would not even stand up to a hundredth, a thousandth, or a hundred thousandth part [of the latter], or to [any descriptions of] examples or causes [for them]. Likewise, as for what are explained as the aspects of the merit that [results from] having faith in the sutra collection of expedient meaning up through applying oneself to their forms of meditation, they do not even come close to a fraction of the merit that [results from] having faith in, and meditating on, the sutra collection of definitive meaning, nor do they stand up to [any descriptions of] examples or causes [for them]. Furthermore, the sutras say:After I have passed into nirvana,If some among the human beings Are able to give rise to pure faith That the sugata heart exists In all kinds of sentient beings,They are representatives of the Buddha’s kindness.The Ahgulimallyasutra says:"},{"pageNumber":866,"pageContent":"850 TranslationsThose who teach the tathagata heart are called “perfect buddhas,” no matter who they are, whether they have afflictions, or whether they are without afflictions.2700And:By virtue of the cause that consists of understanding that the perma­nent tathagata heart exists in all sentient beings, one will find all the many supreme forms of bliss and all excellencies that there are in the world.

Line 8b “since the welfare of sentient beings depends on the victor” corre­sponds to the first reason (“since buddha wisdom enters into the multitudes of beings” in I.27a and “because the perfect buddhakaya radiates” in I.28a). It highlights the intrinsic affinity between the buddha natures of buddhas and sentient beings, which enables the former to benefit and awaken the lat­ter. In this vein, an interlinear gloss on verse 11 explicidy relates the twofold dharmakaya—“the utterly stainless dharmadhatu and its natural outflow (teaching the principles of profundity and diversity)” in Uttaratantra 1.145 (explained by R G W as “consisting of the arising of [individually] corre­sponding [forms of] cognizance in other sentient beings to be guided”) to “the perfect buddhakaya radiates...” Line 8c “because suchness operates in accordance with the welfare [of beings]” corresponds to the second reason (“since its stainlessness is nondual by nature” in I.27b and “because such­ness is undifferentiable” in I.28b). This line emphasizes the active nature of suchness when it is understood as buddha nature, which always engages in the welfare of sentient beings, be it in the form of external buddha activity or as the internal driving force for the path of ordinary beings and bodhi- sattvas to attain buddhahood.The second chapter of Ratnakaraiantis Sutrasamuccayabhasya estab­lishes that the teaching of there being only a single yana ultimately is of855"},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"856 Appendix 1definitive meaning. In this context, he says that the tathagata heart is only temporarily obscured by adventitious stains and quotes a verse by the Bud­dha also found in RGW , Nâgàrjuna’s Dharmadhâtustava, and Uttaratantra1.28. Ratnàkarasànti concludes that the tathagata heart is the single disposi­tion that serves as the basis for there being just a single yàna.Since the dharmadhâtu has the meaning of gotra, they are inseparable. Therefore, since all [beings] possess tathdgatagarbha, its fruition is just a single yàna. However, since it was taught as various yânas in the form of progressive means of realization and [since] this gotra does not ap­pear due to [being obscured by] afflictions and so on, temporarily, [the Buddha] spoke of five gotras. For, he said:Just as within stony debris Pure gold does not appear,And then appears through being purified,The sugata is said [to appear] in the world.2717Also noble Nàgàrjuna says [in his Dharmadhâtustava]:In a pregnant woman’s womb,A child exists but is not seen.Just so, dharmadhâtu is not seen,When it’s covered by afflictions.2718Likewise, noble Maitreya states [in his Uttaratantra]:Because the illuminating dharmadhâtu radiates,There is no difference in suchness,And the actuality of the disposition appears,All [sentient beings] possess the sugata heart.2719Therefore, just as [described in] the Tathàgatagarbhasütra, though [tathdgatagarbha] is ensnared by afflictions, when the conditions for [its] awakening have formed, all [yânas] are simply a single yàna.2720Note that Ratnàkarasànti’s version of Uttaratantra 1.28 contains inter­esting variant readings, especially in lines a and c. Either Ratnàkarasànti"},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 857paraphrased 1.28 in this way himself (or quoted it so from memory) or he used a different manuscript of the Uttaratantra.2721Tibetan Com m entariesThe following presents a selection of Tibetan commentaries on Uttaratan­tra 1.27-28 that shows the wide range of explaining and justifying the three “proofs” in these verses.Ngog LotsáwaNgog Lotsáwa’s Synopsis o f the <eUttaratantra>i2722 first elaborates on the ex­ample of the huge scroll the size of an entire trichiliocosm that is encapsu­lated in a single minute particle. Here, the buddha wisdom that exists in the mind streams of sentient beings is the dharmadhátu. This dharmadhátu is wisdom in the sense that the prajñá of buddhas knows, in a single moment, all phenomena to lack characteristics. Therefore, this prajñá is inseparable from what it knows. Thus, the ultimate, this very dharmadhátu, is the wis­dom that is aware of this dharmadhátu. Since said dharmadhátu abides in all sentient beings in a complete manner, the example and its meaning are very much justified. W hen the obscurations have subsided, no charac­teristics whatsoever are seen, and this very nonseeing is the seeing of true reality. The wisdom of nothing to be seen is nothing but suchness itself. Therefore, it is in this sense justified (that dharmadhátu and wisdom are one).As for the intention of lines I.28ac, Ngog says that sentient beings pos­sess the tathágata heart because they (a) possess the fruitional, (b) the nat­ural, and (c) the causal tathágata heart, (a) The perfect buddhakáya is pure suchness, and its radiating refers to sentient beings being pervaded by it. It pervades them because it is suitable to be attained by all sentient beings. From this perspective, the “tathágata” (in “tathágata heart”) refers to the actual tathágata, while it is only in a nominal sense that sentient beings possess the heart of this tathágata. For those who have the fortune to at­tain this tathágatahood are labeled as being pervaded by it. (b) In terms of suchness, both “tathágata” and sentient beings who possess the tathágata heart are taken to be the actual suchness. For even when suchness, which is naturally devoid of stains, is associated with adventitious obscurations, it is the nature of a buddha and it definitely abides in the mind streams of sentient beings, (c) In terms of the disposition, “tathágata” is understood in a nominal sense because the causes for attaining the state of pure such­ness—the latent tendencies of virtue that consist of the seeds of prajñá"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"858 Appendix 1and compassion—are the causes of a tathagata, whereas it is precisely the disposition that is “the heart of sentient beings.”Marpa Dopa and Parahitabhadra (as represented in CMW)CM W s2723 explanation of 1.28 starts by saying that the Uttaratantra is the treatise that determines the meaning of the sutras of definitive mean­ing. Therefore, in order to determine the intended meaning of the state­ment in the Tathagatagarbhasutra that “All sentient beings possess the tathagata heart,” first, the comments on the intention of the scriptures of the Tathagata about the basic element are explained in 1.28. Next, CMW indicates that its comments on this verse are based on the purport of verses 1.144/147-52/155, which match the dharmakaya, suchness, and the dispo­sition with the nine examples. This is followed by the explanation of the actual words of 1.28:The basic element has three phases—the phase of its being pure, the phase of its being both pure and impure, and the phase of its being im­pure. The phrase “Since the perfect buddhakaya radiates” refers to the phase of its being pure. [In it,] “kaya” [means] the dharmakaya, which [actually] refers to all three kayas. “Through what does one know that?” Maitreya himself says [below]:The dharmakaya is to be known as twofold—The utterly stainless dharmadhatuAnd its natural outflow (teachingThe principles of profundity and diversity).2724“Radiates” [means] that these three kayas pervade all sentient beings. “How do they pervade them?” In order to purify the basic element of sentient beings for as long as samsara is not empty, with the dhar- makayas functioning as the support, the sambhogakaya promotes the welfare [of sentient beings] through pervading the pure retinues who dwell on the bhumis, and the three [kinds of] nirmanakaya per­form the welfare [of sentient beings] through pervading the impure retinues. Therefore, the basis to be purified—the [tathagata] heart or basic element—exists in [all] sentient beings. “Why?” If the basis to be purified—the basic element—did not exist [in sentient beings], their being pervaded by the three kayas would be pointless. Having that in mind, [Maitreya] says, “All beings always possess the buddha"},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 859heart.”2725 Such is not only explained in the Uttaratantra alone, but the Mahdydnasutralamkdra states:Just as space is asserted to be always omnipresent,This is held to be always omnipresent.Just as space is omnipresent in the hosts of forms,It is omnipresent in the hosts of sentient beings.2726The phrase, “since suchness is undifferentiable” refers to the phase of the basic elements being both pure and impure—the naturally pure suchness of buddhas and sentient beings is without any difference. This is declared in the Mahdydnasutralamkdra [as follows]:Though it is without difference in everything,Suchness having become pure Is the Tathagata. Therefore,All beings possess its heart.2727[The phrase] “since the disposition exists” refers to the phase of the basic elements being impure—since the disposition of a tathagata ex­ists in all sentient beings, it abides as what is suitable to give rise to the dharmakaya. Exactly this is explained [in the Uttaratantra] below:It is held that the three buddhakayas Are obtained from these two dispositions—The first kaya, by virtue of the first one,And the latter two, by virtue of the second one.2728The following paragraph represents CMW’s comments on the nature of the basic element as explained in Uttaratantra 1.30-31. However, since this paragraph again takes up the three reasons in 1.28 and further elaborates on them through connecting them with 1.30-31, it is presented here too.In terms of the particular [characteristics of the nature of the basic element], during the phase of the basic elements being pure, the dhar­makaya radiates into all sentient beings, thus possessing the power to accomplish the goals that sentient beings think about. Therefore, it is similar to a precious gem. During the phase of the basic element’s being both pure and impure, the suchness of buddhas and sentient beings is"},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"86o Appendix 1undifferentiable. Therefore, it is similar to space. During the phase of the basic element’s being impure, the maháyána disposition exists in all sentient beings. Therefore, it is similar to water since it moistens the mind streams [of beings] by way of compassion. In terms of its general characteristic, in analogy with these three examples [of a jewel, space, and water] being pure by nature, their meaning refers to the basic ele­ment’s being pure by nature.2729Later,2730 CMW’s comments on 1.144/147-52/155 explicitly correlate verses 1.145/148-147/150 with line I.28a; verse 1.148/151, with I.28b; and verses 1.149/152-152/155, with I.28c. In particular, the dharmakáya consists of the actual stainless dharmakáya (suchness endowed with twofold purity) and its natural outflow—the two rüpakáyas. Due to explaining the maháyána dharma, the rüpakáyas serve as the concordant cause for others attain­ing the dharmakáya through studying, reflecting, and meditating on this dharma. Furthermore, since the rüpakáyas represent the result that is con­cordant with the cause that is the dharmakáya, the dharmakáya itself is also their concordant cause. In terms of ultimate reality, the rüpakáyas teach the profundity of emptiness to bodhisattvas (ultimately, this represents the sambhogakáya). In terms of seeming reality, they explain the diversity of the three yánas (ultimately, this represents the nirmánakáya).Suchness is compared to three attributes of gold—its being pure by na­ture, its color being changeless, and its being suitable to be made into orna­ments (suggesting that, though suchness is undifferentiable in buddhas and sentient beings, it can eventually manifest as all kinds of precious qualities of realization and relinquishment).As for the disposition, verse 1.149/152 is said to describe its essence in terms of the naturally abiding and the unfolding disposition. Just as a trea­sure exists since the beginning of the world and is not created by humans, the naturally abiding disposition exists since beginningless time and is not created by the efforts of people. Just as a tree grows through water, manure, and so on, the unfolding disposition represents the arising of proper mental engagement such as studying. Verses 1.150/153-152/155 present the power or capacity of the disposition. Just as a precious statue is not produced now and all kinds of desired things arise if it is supplicated, the dharmakáya is unproduced by causes and conditions and is a treasure of qualities such as the powers. Just like a prince, the sambhogakáya enjoys the maháyána dharma like a kingdom. Just as a golden statue is not an actual body but an image of a body, the nirmánakáya arises as an image in samádhi."},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 861This is followed by a discussion of the àlaya and its relation to the dis­position,2731 which is primarily based on the first chapter of the M ahâyàna- samgraha and its commentary Vivrtagûdhàrthapindavyàkhyà. Being phrased throughout in classical Yogàcàra diction, this section is a clear ex­ample of an early Tibetan commentary that based on the position of the Indian master Parahitabhadra, explicitly combines the Yogàcàra teachings with those on buddha nature, which is exactly what later Tibetans such as the Third Karmapa and virtually all Shentongpas did in great detail. In par­ticular, CMW quotes Parahitabhadra as saying that the àlaya and the dis­position are the same—the naturally abiding àlaya’s being the same as the naturally abiding disposition and the adventitious àlayas being the same as the unfolding disposition. The àlaya is the foundation of both contam­inated seeds and the uncontaminated seeds of the supramundane mind, which coexist like a mix of water and milk. However, the uncontaminated seeds do not exist substantially, are not able to produce manifest uncon­taminated results yet, and are not the primary seeds in the àlaya, while the seeds of afflicted phenomena have the opposite characteristics. Therefore, the Mahâyànasamgraha refers to the àlaya as the support of afflicted phe­nomena alone. As for the coexistence of both uncontaminated and contam­inated seeds in the naturally abiding disposition or àlaya, until one focuses on this àlaya through the remedial path, the seeds of afflicted phenomena exist in it as adventitious stains. However, once one focuses on this àlaya through the path, the adventitious stains become purified.Furthermore, CMW s introduction2732 elaborates on “the three natures” that are used in the three reasons in 1.28: (1) the stainless dharmakàya, (2) changeless suchness, and (3) the disposition endowed with qualities. The text also provides instructions on how to work with these three in medita­tion. First, CMW describes the stainless dharmakàya as follows:The stainless dharmadhàtu of ones own mind, by its very essence be­yond [ordinary states of] mind and inconceivable by thoughts, is the instruction beyond expression on the definitive meaning, that is, the profound that is of one taste.

There are three guiding instructions about this dharmakàya. First, the mind appearing as all kinds of thoughts is the means. This being free from identification is prajnà. Minds appearing but being without nature, lucid yet without"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"862 Appendix 1clinging, is the nondual path. This is [how to] rest in the dharmakaya first. In between, if thoughts arise, their being examined by prajna is the indication of profundity. In the end, letting them be as lucid wis­dom in an uncontrived manner is the indication of guidance through means.Next, the text explains suchness’s not changing through thoughts three parts:(a) With regard to guidance through examples, as the example for [suchness’s] being changeless, consider the sky—no matter how much dust and smoke may arise [in it], the sky is not tainted. Thoughts are like this example. As the example for [suchness’s] being untainted, consider gold—gold is not tainted by a film and stains [on it], which are like thoughts. As the example for [suchness’s] being pure, consider water—if water is not muddied, [this resembles suchness’s] not being muddied by thoughts.(b) Guidance through the meaning is sixfold. (1) At the time of being a sentient being, the true nature of the mind—suchness—does not change into the stains in its essence, no matter which afflictions and thoughts may arise. If suchness became the stains of thoughts, one would not become a buddha. (2) At the time of being a buddha, [suchness] does not change into qualities—there is no enhancement in the essence of the dharmakaya, which is self-arisen wisdom. If there were, one would not become a buddha through the path. (3)-(4) The stainless true nature of the mind is not tainted by flaws at the time of being a sentient being, nor is it tainted by qualities at the time of being a buddha. [As the Uttaratantra says:]There is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.2733[And:]Similarly, with the treasure of jewels lodged within the mind, Whose true nature is stainless and without anything to be added or to be removed,Not being realized, all these beings continuously experience The suffering of being destitute in many ways.2734"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 863(5) Sentient beings are the adventitious flaws of thoughts.

[Thus,] one familiarizes with this luminosity of ones own mind.(c) You may wonder, “How does one familiarize [with this]?” [One does so through] the three inconceivable [ways of] taking these very [guiding instructions] as the path. (1) At the time of being a sentient being, suchness is naturally pure and the essence of the mind is real as self-arisen wisdom. Through [minds] not recognizing its own face, the stains of thoughts arise, which is inconceivable. What one makes a living experience is thoughts being pointed out to be unidentifiable.(2) At the time of being a buddha, naturally stainless mind is real as self-arisen wi'sdom. Through [mind’s] recognizing its own face, it is free from the adventitious stains of thoughts, which is inconceivable purity. One makes this certainty about natural luminosity a living experience.(3) The [tathágata] heart—the dharmakáya, self-arisen wisdom—is without distinction in buddhas and sentient beings. Its essence—al­pha-pure ultimate luminosity—is the inconceivable nature. The tem­porary lack of realizing the true nature of the mind is its inconceivable appearance as all kinds of thoughts and flaws for sentient beings. The realization of the true nature of the mind is its inconceivable appear­ance as the kàyas and wisdoms for buddhas. [Thus,] natural luminos­ity is to be resolved through the view, temporarily to be made a living experience through familiarization, and thereafter one should train in compassion and bodhicitta.Finally, the disposition endowed with qualities is discussed in five parts:(a) The luminosity of one’s own mind is the disposition for the dhar­makáya. Since it abides primordially and by nature as buddhahood, it is not that something nonexistent is accomplished. There is not the slightest buddhahood to be added apart from the realization of one’s own mind, (b) To realize thoughts as being adventitious is the samb­hogakáya. (c) The arising of compassion for those who do not realize this is the nirmánakáya. (d) By virtue of the wisdom of realizing the two rüpakáyas, which is the supreme accomplished disposition, [lumi­nosity] is free from the stains of thoughts—the buddhahood that is the dawn of realization is unceasing.

Since ones own minds being unidentifiable (the expanse) and its being lucid and unceasing (wisdom) are inseparable, the characteristics [of mind’s nature] are beyond [ordinary states of] mind. Therefore, without thoughts and clinging, [all] that appears and exists dawns as the essence of the three kâyas. This has three parts. (1) The nature of the mind is the dharmakàya—the essence of the minds of all sentient beings in the three realms is real as luminosity. (2) The arising of one’s own realization of this actuality through instructions and familiarization is the sambhogakàya. Through that, though [this luminosity] itself may arise as all kinds of thoughts, one realizes that their essence lacks a root.

(1) The first reason is that the dharmakàya—emptiness—pervades all sentient beings, which means that buddhahood is the dharmakàya, the dharmakàya is emptiness, and emptiness pervades all sentient beings. (2) The second reason is that the nature of phenomena—suchness—is undifferentiable, that is, the suchness of buddhas and the suchness of sentient beings cannot be differentiated in terms of being better and worse, bigger and smaller, or higher and lower,"},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 865respectively. (3) The third reason is that the disposition exists in all sentient beings, that is, beings have five kinds of buddha disposition: (a) the cut-off disposition, (b) the uncertain disposition, (c) the šrávaka disposition, (d) the pratyekabuddha disposition, and (e) the mahàyàna disposition.(a) According to Asanga, those with the cut-off disposition are those who have the six characteristics of not feeling the slightest weariness even when seeing the flaws of samsara, not feeling the slightest faith even when hear­ing about the qualities of the Buddha, not feeling the slightest regret about excessively engaging in wrongdoings, and not having the slightest shame, embarrassment, and compassion. Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra III. 11 says:Some are solely devoted to wrongdoing,Some have completely destroyed the immaculate dharmas,Some lack the virtue conducive to liberation,Some have inferior immaculate [dharmas], and [some] lack the cause.2737When the Buddha spoke about beings with the “cut-off disposition,” he had in mind that they remain in samsara for a very long time but not that they will absolutely never attain buddhahood—if they make efforts, they too will attain it. Thus, the M ahàkarunàpundarïkasütra says:Ananda, even if a sentient being who has no karmic fortune to pass into nirvana does as little as tossing up a flower into space by focusing on the Buddha, the result of this root of virtue will be the result that is nirvana. I say that [this being] will reach the culmination of nirvana and the end of nirvana.2738(b) The uncertain disposition depends on conditions. For example, it turns into the šrávaka disposition upon relying on a spiritual friend who is a šrávaka, associating with companions who are šrávakas, or seeing the scriptures of the šravakas. The same goes for the conditions that make the uncertain disposition turn into the pratyekabuddha disposition or the mahàyàna disposition.(c) The characteristics of the šrávaka disposition consist of being afraid of samsàra after having seen its flaws, having confidence in nirvána, and possessing little compassion (that is, not being very interested in the welfare of beings)."},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"866 Appendix 1(d) The characteristics of the pratyekabuddha disposition consist of the three of the srâvaka disposition as well as being very proud, keeping ones master secret, and liking to be in solitude.(e) The mahàyàna disposition is classified as twofold—the naturally abiding disposition and the accomplished disposition. The nature of the naturally abiding disposition is the capacity of generating the buddha qual­ities that is of beginningless time and obtained by virtue of the nature of phenomena. The nature of the accomplished disposition is the capacity of generating the buddha qualities that is obtained by having familiarized with roots of virtue before. The synonyms for the mahàyàna disposition are “seed,” “basic element,” and “nature.” It is superior to the dispositions of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas because the latter reach their level of com­plete purity through having purified just the afflictive obscurations, whereas the mahàyàna disposition reaches its level of complete purity through hav­ing purified both obscurations.The mahàyàna disposition can be either awakened (that is, its signs being observable) or unawakened. The four adverse conditions for its awakening are being born in states lacking leisure (such as in the lower realms or as long-living gods), being heedless, engaging in wrong ways, and possessing the flaws of the obscurations. The favorable conditions for its awakening are the outer condition of being taught the genuine dharma by others and the inner condition that consists of proper mental engagement, striving for roots of virtue, and so on. According to the Dasadharmakasütra, the signs of the bodhisattva disposition are that, without relying on a remedy, ones body and speech are naturally gentle, ones mind has little deceit and hypocrisy, and one is loving and open toward all sentient beings. According to M ahâyânasütràlamkâra III.5, the signs are that whatever bodhisattvas do is preceded by their compassion for sentient beings, they have faith in the mahàyàna dharma, they endure all hardships without second thought, and they engage in the roots of virtue that have the nature of the pàramitàs.Among these five dispositions, the existence of the mahàyàna disposi­tion is the proximate cause of buddhahood. Since the dispositions of srà- vakas and pratyekabuddhas also lead to the attainment of buddhahood in the end, they are the distant causes of buddhahood. Within the uncertain disposition, there are some that are a proximate cause and some that are a distant cause. Since the cut-off disposition only refers to a long time before attaining buddhahood but not to absolutely never attaining buddhahood, it is the very distant cause of buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 867The examples for the existence of the disposition for buddhahood in all sentient beings include being like silver in silver ore, sesame oil in sesame seeds, and butter in milk. Thus, just as silver can be manifested in silver ore, oil in seeds, and butter in milk, buddhahood can be manifested in sentient beings.Rinchen YeshéRinchen Yeshé’s commentary on the Uttaratantra2739 begins by repeating what R G W says on 1.28 and then elaborates on the meaning of the first three lines of this verse. As for the meaning of the dharmakaya of a tathagata pervading all sentient beings, the naturally pure dharmakaya pervades all sentient beings. The dharmakaya that is also pure of all adventitious stains pervades all sentient beings as being suitable to be attained. Or, the phrase, “the perfect’buddhakäya” refers to being pervaded by all three kâyas. To support this, Rinchen Yeshé first quotes Uttaratantra 1.144 and R G W on 1.146-47. As for the manner of the three kâyas’ pervading sentient beings, he says that they exist in beings as being suitable to be attained as the m an­ifest three kâyas. Or, in order to purify the basic element of sentient be­ings for as long as samsára is not empty, the dharmakàya functions as the support for that, while the sambhogakâya promotes the welfare of pure retinues by pervading them, and the nirmänakäya promotes the welfare of impure retinues by pervading them. Therefore, the basis to be purified by these three kâyas—the basic element that is the tathàgata heart—exists in sentient beings. If this basis to be purified did not exist in beings, the promotion of their welfare through the three kâyas would be pointless.2740As for the meaning of suchness’s being undifferentiable, since its nature never changes into anything else, it is suchness. It exists in all sentient beings and buddhas in an undifferentiable manner. As Mahäyänasüträlamkära IX.37 says:Though it is without difference in everything,Suchness’s having become pure Is the Tathàgata. Therefore,All beings possess its heart.Also the prajfiàpâramitâ sùtras say:The suchness of the world, the suchness of arhats,The suchness of pratyekabuddhas, and the suchness of the victors—"},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"868 Appendix 1As just a single suchness, free from being and never other,Has prajnàpàramità been realized by the Tathagata.2741And:The element of space in the eastern direction, in the southern direction,Likewise in the western direction and the northern direction is boundless.Existing above, below, in the ten directions, and in as many as there are,There is no difference and there is no distinction.The suchness of the past, the suchness of the future,Likewise the suchness of the present, the suchness of arhats,The suchness of all phenomena, and the suchness of the victors—All this is the suchness of dharma, and there is no distinction.2742As for the meaning of the dispositions existing in sentient beings, the disposition of the manifest three kâyas being suitable to be attained, if this disposition is purified, exists in all sentient beings. Therefore, one should understand that all beings possess the buddha heart.2743Butôn Rinchen DrubIn his Ornament That Illuminates and Beautifies the Tathagata Heart,2744 Butôn says that the teachings on tathâgatagarbha are of expedient mean­ing. He supports this by lengthy quotes from the Ghanavyühasütra, the Lankâvatârasütra, the Srïmâlàdevïsütra, and the Angulimàlïyasütra. Butôn also adduces the typical three criteria that are considered to determine a teaching as being of expedient meaning: (1) its basis of intention (dgongs gzhi)y (2) its purpose (dgos p a )y and (3) the logical invalidation of the ex­plicit statement (dngos lagnod byed).(1) The general basis of intention of the teachings on buddha nature is the àlaya-consciousness, which refers to the sheer cause of buddhahood. In particular, Maitreya in his Uttaratantra had a threefold basis of intention in mind: (a) the dharmakàya, (b) suchness, and (c) the disposition.(2) The purpose of teaching tathâgatagarbha lies in the indirect intention (Idem por dgongs pa) of its being the remedy that eliminates the five flaws de­scribed in Uttaratantra 1.157-67.2745 In addition, Butôn adduces Uttaratantra"},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 8691.28, showing that the statement “all beings contain the buddha heart” was taught for three reasons. Following RGW , Butön matches these three reasons with the nine examples in Uttaratantra 1.144-52. However, his explanation of these three consists mainly of extensive quotes from the Mahäparinir­vänasütra, the Avatamsakasütra, and the Mahäyänasüträlamkära.(a) As for the dharmakàya, Butön cites the Avatamsakasütra as saying that the dharmakàya pervades all sentient beings, all phenomena, and all realms, just as formless space does. According to Butön, this was said with the intention that the dharmakàya is not attained right now, but will be attained later. Citing the Mahäparinirvänasütra, he also refutes the notion that buddhahood dwells within due to the dharmakäya’s pervading every­thing and thus dwelling within sentient beings.(b) As for suchness’s being undifferentiable, Butön says that the basic na­ture of all sentient beings—natural luminosity, which does not change into anything else—is the suchness of mind. It exists in buddhas and sentient beings without difference. Once that suchness—natural luminosity—has become pure of all adventitious stains without exception, it is buddha­hood. Since this suchness also exists in sentient beings without difference, its complete purification of all stains will be attained later if they have cul­tivated the path. Therefore, the statement that suchness is undifferentiable is also made with the intention of referring to another time.(c) As for all sentient beings’ possessing the disposition, the disposition is what gives rise to the three kàyas of a buddha. Since the tathägatadhätu exists in all sentient beings, it is taught that they possess the tathàgata heart. Quoting Uttaratantra 1.27, Butön says that since the teaching on the dis­position is a case of labeling the cause with the name of the result, it like­wise bears the intention of referring to another time. Also the example of the big scroll in the Avatamsakasütra was given with such an intention. Butön quotes that sûtra as saying that, due to being uninterrupted from the birth of all buddhas up through their entering parinirväna, the bud­dhas fill up the entire dharmadhâtu, and the seeing of all the diverse births of buddhas represents the eighth expertise in explanations with an inten­tion. According to Butön, this passage refers again to the above threefold basis of intention (dharmakàya, suchness, and disposition), because it bears the intention of the seeds of all dharmas (chos) that are the buddha qualities existing in a complete manner and their true nature (chos nyid)— suchness—existing without difference before and after. According to the Mahäparinirvänasütra, the nature of a buddha exists in all sentient beings because the seeds of buddhahood exist in them."},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"870 Appendix 1(3) Finally, Butón says that all this also establishes the invalidation of what the teachings on buddha nature say explicitly. In addition, he quotes the well-known passage from the ŠrimáládevisUtra:The tathágata heart is empty of all cocoons of afflictions that are sep­arable [from it] and [can] be known to be divisible [from it]. It is not empty of the inconceivable buddha qualities that are inseparable [from it], [can]not be known to be divisible [from it], and far surpass the sand grains in the river Gaňgá [in number].2746However, Buton gives a very peculiar interpretation of the phrase “empty of . . . [can] be known” (shes pa m a m s kyis stong pa), taking it to mean “empty of knowing” (shes pas stong pa) and concluding that this phrase explains the tathágata heart as lacking wisdom. Therefore, he says, it also lacks all the qualities that are contained in this wisdom, because these two (wisdom and qualities) must be produced by the two immeasurable accumulations of wisdom and merit, respectively.Dolpopa Sherab GyaltsenDólpopas commentary on the Uttaratantra2747 explains 1.28 as the m an­ner in which the dharmadhátu pervades everything. Since the dharmakáya of the perfect buddhas radiates toward and pervades all phenomena, since suchness—the nature of all phenomena of samsára and nirvana—is un­differentiable, and because the disposition of the tathágatas—the naturally pure dharmadhátu—exists in all sentient beings as being suitable to be pu­rified from its obscurations, all beings always possess the ultimate buddha heart since the very beginning in an uninterrupted manner.2748Gyaltsab Darma RinchenIn his commentary on the Uttaratantra,2749 the Gelugpa scholar Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen says that the tathágata heart is explained by way of the result that is a tathágata, the nature of a tathágata, and the cause of a tathágata. However, it is not that mere suchness and the dharmakáya of perfect buddhas are taken as instances of the tathágata heart because the Uttaratantra and Asaňgas commentary explain the latter as pertaining solely to the phase of sentient beings and the phase of the cause. As for identifying the three instances of the tathágata heart in Uttaratantra 1.28, the result of having cultivated the path that purifies the basic element— the enlightened activity of the dharmakáya of perfect buddhas—radiates"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 871toward and pervades all sentient beings.2750 Beings are explained to possess the tathagata heart because they have this very factor of being suitable for enlightened activity to engage them, which is associated with them as the special phenomenon that exists solely in the mind streams of sentient be­ings. This is similar to Abhisamayálamkára VIII. 1 lab:By virtue of the vastness of activity like that,Buddhahood is described as “all-pervading.”Though suchness naturally devoid of stains is the nature of both sentient beings and buddhas, by taking its being the nature of buddhas as a reason, it refers to the tathagata heart at the time when it is associated with the stains of the mind streams of sentient beings. It is said that all sentient beings possess the tathagata heart with the intention that suchness with stains—the very suchness that is naturally devoid of the stains of the mind streams of sentient beings—exists in all beings. The same is also said with the intention that all beings possess the buddha disposition during the phase of the cause that makes them attain the three kayas. Though there is also the naturally abiding disposition, when it is explained that beings possess the tathagata heart through taking the existence of the disposition as a reason, this must be explained from the perspective of the cause of a tathagata. When the same is explained through taking the existence of suchness as a reason, it must be explained from the perspective of the nature of a tathagata.Therefore, one should understand that the Tathágatagarbhasütra, the Uttaratantra, and Asañga’s commentary (R G W ) excellently determine the tathagata heart as being all of the following three—the capacity in sentient beings mind streams of their being suitable for enlightened activity to en­gage them, the suchness with stains in the mind streams of sentient beings, and the buddha disposition in the mind streams of beings that is suitable to change state into the three kayas. W ithout realizing these meanings, to as­sert even the ultimate dharmakaya as the tathagata heart through dividing the latter into the triad of the resultant, the natural, and the causal tathagata heart is a presentation that may amaze the ignorant, but it is not the m ean­ing of the Uttaratantra and Asañga’s commentary.Rongton Shéja GünsiAccording to Rongton Shéja Günsis commentary on the Uttaratantray2751 all sentient beings are said to possess the tathagata heart because the"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"872 Appendix 1dharmakàya of perfect buddhas radiates, because they possess the such­ness that is undifferentiable from the aspect of the natural purity of the suchness of the dharmakàya, and because they have the disposition for the dharmakàya—the capacity of the basic element.After briefly reporting Ngog Lotsàwas above explanation of 1.28 and quoting 1.27, Rongton presents the manner in which Uttaratantra 1.144-52 and R G W match the dharmakàya, suchness, and the disposition with the nine examples for buddha nature. He says that the meaning of the tathàga- ta-dharmakàya’s radiating in all sentient beings is that the dharmakàya of realization pervades all sentient beings, quoting R G W :These three examples of a buddha image, honey, and a kernel explain that all sentient beings possess the heart of a tathágata in the sense of the tathàgata-dharmakàyas pervading the entire realm of sentient be­ings without exception.2752The citation of Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra IX. 15 in R G W is taken as being the reason for this. According to Rongton, this means that the factor of natural purity—the cause for attaining the fundamental change of both the dharmakàya of realization and the dharmakàya of the teachings—pervades all sentient beings.As for the meaning of suchnesss being undifferentiable, it is explained as “undifferentiable” because its being empty of any real nature pervades everything in terms of the ground and the fruition and everything internal and external. As for being pervaded by the disposition, this refers to the capacity of the mind that is to be awakened by conditions—the substantial cause of buddha wisdom. As Uttaratantra 1.104c says:So the uncontaminated wisdom in beings is like honey...This explains the basic element to be purified, whose function is the function of the disposition—seeing the qualities of happiness and the flaws of suffering. Here, the assertion that the meaning of “the dharmakàya’s radiating” as being pervaded by enlightened activity is not justified because this contradicts the meaning of Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra IX. 15, which is adduced as the reason for this. Therefore, there is no flaw of repetition either since natural purity is used in terms of its being contained within the mind stream, while suchness pervades everything internal and external."},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 873Suchness and natural purity exist in the manner of a quality and the bearer of this quality, respectively. As Uttaratantra 1.164c says:... the qualities, whose nature is pure.The meaning of the suchness of a tathagata’s being undifferentiable from all sentient beings is that the suchness of buddhas exists in all sentient beings in an undifferentiable manner. For R G W says:Thus, in the sense of suchnesss being undifferentiable, this one exam­ple of gold explains that the tathagata—suchness—is the heart of all these sentient beings.2753The citation of Maháydnasütralarnkdra IX.37 is taken as being the rea­son for this. Thus, the nature of phenomena—being empty of a nature—is without difference.The meaning of the tathagata dispositions existing in all beings is that the disposition for giving rise to the three buddhakáyas exists in sentient beings. For R G W says:The remaining five examples of a treasure, a tree, a precious statue, a cakravartin, and a golden image explain that the tathagata element is the heart of all these sentient beings in the sense that the disposition for the arising of the three kinds of buddhakáyas exists [in all beings].2754The citation from the Abhidharmamahayánasütra is taken as being the reason for this.Go LotsáwaGo Lotsáwas commentary2755 says that the explanation of the three points of the buddhakáya s radiating and so on is based on the passage from the Anünatvápürnatvanirdesaparivarta that is quoted at the beginning of R G W ’ as the source of the fourth vajra point. GCs actual comments on 1.27-28 state that the buddha wisdom that enters all sentient beings is ex­pressed as “the tathagata heart.”2756 Though this buddha wisdom is the ac­tual tathagata, it is only the nominal heart of sentient beings because it is not contained in the mind streams of sentient beings. Also, the nature of the mind (suchness without adventitious stains) that exists in both buddhas and sentient beings without any difference is called “tathagata heart.” The"},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"874 Appendix 1suchness that exists in buddhas is the actual suchness and the suchness of sentient beings is buddhahood in a nominal sense. As for the buddha dis­position, it is the factor in all sentient beings that represents the manner in which their skandhas and so on are similar to buddhahood. This dis­position is also called “tathagata heart” by metaphorically referring to it as its fruition, tathàgatahood. Among the Sanskrit synonyms of garbha, sàra represents a basis from which many dharmas radiate or emanate, thus re­ferring to the dharmakaya. Hrdaya has the sense of being crucial or some­thing to be cherished, like the heart of a person. Thus, it refers to suchness because those who wish for liberation need to regard it as crucial or cherish it. Garbha itself means “seed” or “womb.” Since it stands for something that is present in an enclosing sheath, it refers to the disposition. M anda means “something very firm” or “quintessence,” as in calling the vajra seat in Bodhgàya bodhimanda or speaking of “the essence of butter.”Thus, sentient beings possess the tathagata heart because they are per­vaded by the perfect buddhakaya, because their suchness exists as being undifferentiable from buddhas, and because they have the buddha dispo­sition. This can be proven by either one of these three reasons—that there are three is only for the sake of guiding different sentient beings. However, all they prove is only a convention (and not a fact), that is, they just explain the meaning of the statement, “All beings possess the tathagata heart” in different words, but they do not prove the fact that all sentient beings pos­sess it.Furthermore, GC describes Ngog s above division into resultant, natural, and causal tathagata heart as being “very excellent” and further divides each one of these into their seeming and ultimate aspects.2757 The dharmakàya is twofold in terms of its. qualities of freedom and maturation. The disposi­tion is twofold as the naturally abiding and the accomplished dispositions. Suchness is not said to be divided in the Uttaratantra, but the teachings of the Buddha in general speak of the suchness of the ultimate and the such­ness of the seeming. The division into three (dharmakàya, suchness, and disposition) is nothing but a division of the nature of the single suchness that is unchanging throughout all three phases. Thus, the three consist of nothing but suchness.At the end of its comments on the fourth vajra point, GC says that the entire chapter on the basic element is an explanation of nothing but the meaning of Uttaratantra I.28.2758 This meaning is comprehensively sum­marized in the ten points (such as nature and cause) through which the"},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 875basic element is presented, while the verses on the nine examples are simply an elaboration on it.Šákya ChogdenŠákya Chogden’s explanation of the Uttaratantra2759 criticizes Ngog Lotsàwa’s position on buddha nature, saying that it is not good that Ngog takes the emptiness of the mind with stains as the tathágata heart because this tathágata heart must be identified from the point of view of its qualities whereas its identification as sheer emptiness is not suitable. The identifica­tion of the tathágata heart by later Tibetans as the naturally abiding dispo­sition is not tenable either because the disposition has to be identified from the point of view of its being associated with stains, whereas the tathágata heart needs to be identified from the point of view of there being no stains to be eliminated any more. Therefore, the actual tathágata heart that is to be identified as what is taught by the Uttaratantra is the suchness that is naturally pure of all flaws and in which all the many qualities such as the ten powers are naturally and spontaneously present. Thus, the lines “since suchness is undifferentiable ... all beings always contain the buddha heart” in Uttaratantra 1.28 including their commentary and related sütras are to be taken literally. However, the lines “since the perfect buddhakàya radiates ... all beings always contain the buddha heart” are not to be taken literally. The line “because of the disposition” teaches the basis of intention; 1.157 on the five flaws such as faintheartedness, the purpose; and I.84c “There is no nirvána apart from buddhahood,” the invalidation of the explicit state­ment. One may think then that it is strange that one and the same treatise gives the two contradictory explanations of the tathágata hearts pervading and not pervading sentient beings. However, Maitreya, by differentiating the identification of the tathágata heart in terms of the two realities, has excellently explained the intention of the two ways in which the Buddha stated in distinct teachings that the tathágata heart pervades and does not pervade all beings.Thus, Šákya Chogden explicitly distinguishes the tathâgatagarbha as the resultant suchness free from all obscurations and endowed with all qualities from the disposition, which refers to obscured suchness as the cause. This is also what Tàranàthas outline of twenty-one differences between Šákya Chogden and Dôlpopa says about Šákya Chogden s position:The tathágata heart does not exist in the mind streams of sentient be­ings. The natural luminosity of the minds of sentient beings is merely"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"876 Appendix 1the cause and the basic element of the tathagata heart. Therefore, though the causal tathagata heart or the tathagata heart that is the basic element exists in all sentient beings, this is not like the [actual tathagata heart] that fulfills this definition. [Rather,] the tathagata heartis buddha wisdom [Šákya Chogden] holds that [statements about]the [tathagata] hearts having the nature of its essence and its qualities being inseparable refer to the phase of the fruition alone. During the phase of the cause, there exists only the seed that is the capacity for the qualities being suitable to arise He holds that only a seed of the fru­ition exists inherently in the natural luminosity of the mind. Through cultivating the path, the increase [of this seed] is attained. Finally, the fruition arises in its manifest form.2760Later in his text,2761 Šakya Chogden says that the tathagata heart does not pervade all sentient beings. For Asañga explains that “inseparable qualities” belong only to the last phase among the three phases of impure sentient beings, pardy pure bodhisattvas, and utterly pure buddhas. Also, the Uttaratantras example of a kings portrait (1.88-92) clearly says that the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects does not exist in srâvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and so on. The example of the sun and its rays (1.93-94) states how the tathagata heart inseparable from all its qualities does not exist until perfect buddhahood is made manifest. Let alone the tathagata hearts being realized by those with great desire, srâvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas, they are not even explained as supports for this tathagata heart.When the Uttaratantra explains the intention behind the statement that all sentient beings possess the buddha heart, it first distinguishes three bases of intention—the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition. The first one is the pure dharmadhâtu without any adventitious stains, which is classified as twofold in terms of its natural outflow—the profound and vast teach­ings. Suchness is said to be nothing but the presentation of its nature. The disposition is twofold, being classified as the naturally abiding disposition and the unfolding disposition, with the latter consisting of the threefold capacity of giving rise to the three kâyas. Among these three bases of in­tention, the dharmakaya is the actual tathàgata heart, suchness is twofold in being and not being the tathàgata heart, and the disposition is a case of labeling the cause with the name of the result. The dharmakàya of per­fect buddhahood entails pervading or radiating toward all sentient beings. Suchness pertains to all phenomena, but the disposition is a phenomena solely in sentient beings. Suchness is threefold in terms of existing in the"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 877four kinds of persons—buddhas, noble bodhisattvas, those of great desire, and tlrthikas. In buddhas, it is the perfect dharmakàya; in noble bodhi­sattvas, a mere fraction of the dharmakàya; and in the others, not even a fraction of the dharmakàya. Therefore, it is not suitable as the disposition. In other words, all noble ones of the mahàyàna (buddhas and bodhisattvas) possess the tathágata heart, but all sentient beings other than those are only labeled as possessing the tathágata heart because suchness and the disposi­tion exist in them.This means that the statement “all beings possess the buddha heart” is made in terms of a basis of intention, a purpose, and an invalidation of the explicit statement. The basis of intention is suchness with stains; the purpose, to relinquish the five flaws; and the invalidation of the explicit statement according to the Uttaratantra itself is as follows. The dharma­dhátu of those of great desire, tlrthikas, árávakas, and pratyekabuddhas is not the tathágata heart because they fall into the views about a real per­sonality and because their minds are distracted from emptiness. Also, the four obscurations that obscure the tathágata heart (hostility toward the mahàyàna dharma, views about a self, fear of samsàras suffering, and in­difference about the welfare of sentient beings) are relinquished by their four remedies (confidence in the mahàyàna dharma and cultivation of prajfiàpàramità, samàdhis, and great compassion). Therefore, it is once the four remedies have arisen that the persons who are the supports of these remedies are said to possess the tathágata heart.Furthermore, the dharmadhátu of those four persons is not the tathágata heart because it lacks the five points of nature, cause, fruition, function, and endowment explained in Uttaratantra 1.30-44. The dharmadhátu of those persons lacks the point of being the nature of the tathágata heart because it is not moistened by power and compassion. Also, the point of its being the cause of the tathágata heart is incomplete because it lacks the four causes that purify the above four obscurations. It lacks the point of fruition be­cause it lacks the remedies that are the opposites of the four kinds of mis­takenness. The point of function is also incomplete because it is uncertain that the dharmadhátu of those persons possesses the functions that arise from the awakening of the power of the disposition through the conditions of the four wheels (relying on wise persons and so on). Otherwise, these functions (weariness of suffering and striving for nirvána) would arise even in those with wrong craving. Likewise, the point of endowment is incomplete because the dharmadhátu of those persons is not endowed with the triad of the dharmakàya, the cause of buddha wisdom, and great"},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"878 Appendix 1compassion. Also, let alone the dharmadhátu of those four persons being inseparable from the qualities that consist of the five supernatural knowl­edges, wisdom, and the termination of contamination, not even a fraction of these qualities exists in that dharmadhátu. In brief, let alone saying that the tathagata heart that is adorned with all the major and minor marks ex­ists in all sentient beings, the Uttaratantra does not even state that the mere tathagata heart exists in them because the basis of intention, the purpose, and the invalidation of the explicit statement “all sentient beings possess the buddha heart” are contained in the words of the Uttaratantra itself.Though some Tibetans say that the Uttaratantra is a commentary in terms of the expedient meaning, there are no earlier commentaries that ex­plain this treatise to be of expedient meaning. Among the two great system founders of the maháyána, Nágárjuna says in his Dharmadhátustava that suchness exists in all sentient beings. He also explains through the example of the waxing moon s gradually increasing that the dharmakaya exists and increases from the first bhümi up through buddhahood.In Asañga s tradition, there is his actual system and the one that entails an intention. As for the first one, in his commentary on the Uttaratantra, he describes the manner of seeing the boundary lines of the tathagata heart from the first bhümi up through buddhahood through the example of the sun s shining in a clouded and a cloud-free sky.2762 If suchness with stains were the actual tathagata heart, this would contradict Uttaratantra 1.154-55 (“There is nothing to be removed from this .. .”) because these two verses teach the tathagata heart that is the dharmakaya pure of all adventitious stains. When one sees a part of ones own true nature pure of stains, one sees that all sentient beings are like that too. This seeing is called “seeing that all sentient beings possess the buddha heart,” “realizing that the dhar­madhatu is omnipresent,” and “realizing variety” (ji snyed rtogspa).In the explanation of the system that entails an intended meaning, the sugata heart refers to sugatahood, which has the two aspects of (1) relin­quishment and (2) realization. (1) Relinquishment is of two kinds—actual and concordant. The latter is twofold—the purification of the stains of the basic element through the four causes such as confidence in the maháyána dharma and the relinquishment of the afflictive stains through the prajñá of the lower yánas. The first one of these is the actual tathagata heart while the latter is not even explained as the basis of intention of the tathagata heart. Suchness with stains is said to be the basis of intention of the tathagata heart from the point of view of its being suitable to become free from adventitious stains, but there is no clear explanation that it is the actual"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 879tathagata heart. Once the power of the disposition is awakened through the four conditions’ having come together and certain parts of the stains of the basic element are eliminated through the four causes such as confidence in the maháyána dharma, this is presented as the actual tathagata heart.(2) Realization is also of two kinds—actual and concordant. The latter is divided into being and not being specified through the four causes such as confidence in the maháyána dharma. The first one of these is further classified as being pure of stains as appropriate on the different levels of the path and not being pure of stains at all. Among these two, it is only the for­mer that is explained as representing the dharmakaya and the sugata heart. Therefore, the buddha heart is divided into two aspects—conditioned and unconditioned—which are the seeming and the ultimate, respectively. It is its unconditioned aspect alone that is held to be what exists in all sentient beings. To say that the buddha heart is solely ultimate reality is the system of others but not the scriptural tradition of Maitreya.Diimo Dashi ÓserDümo Dashi Oser (fifteenth/sixteenth century) omits Uttaratantra 1.27. On 1.28, he comments that all beings possess the tathagata heart since the dharmakaya of a perfect buddha radiates in all sentient beings (that is, the dharmakaya becomes manifest in them through their having familiarized with uncontrived mind as such), since the suchness of sentient beings and the suchness of buddhas is undifferentiable, and since the disposition (the seed of uncontaminated mind) exists in all sentient beings.Mikyo DorjeIn his Lamp That Excellently Elucidates the System o f the Proponents ofShen- tong M adhyam aka, the Eighth Karmapa provides lengthy explanations of the three reasons in Uttaratantra I.28.2763 However, in his commentary on the Abhisamayalamkara, the Karmapa also presents a detailed refutation of these very reasons’ being able to prove the existence of buddha nature in sentient beings.2764Padma KarpoPadma Karpo2765 explains that “Since the perfect buddhakáya radiates” re­fers to the dharmakaya of the tathágatas pervading the nonphysical basic elements of sentient beings because M aháyánasütrálamkára IX.15cd says:"},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"88o Appendix 1Just as space is omnipresent in the hosts of form,It is omnipresent in the hosts of sentient beings.“Since suchness is undifferentiable” indicates that, in all, suchness is not different, with tathàgatas having its pure nature too. “Because of the disposition” refers to the existence of the disposition that produces the three buddhakàyas. As for the disposition, it is a seed or a cause. As the Abhidharmamahàyânasütra says:The dhàtu of beginningless time Is the foundation of all phenomena.Since it exists, all beings And also nirvana are obtained.To speak about the definite disposition here is done with the intention that all sentient beings are suitable to eventually become buddhas.The dharmakàya is the power to accomplish what one wishes for, such­ness never changes into anything else, and the disposition means to be moistened through compassion. In this order, these three specific charac­teristics of the nature of the tathágata heart accord with the examples of a jewel, gold, and water.Kongtrul Lodrô TayéLodrô Tayes commentary on the Uttaratantra (which is basically a copy of Dolpopa’s commentary) briefly explains 1.28 as follows:Because the dharmakàya of perfect buddhas radiates toward and per­vades all phenomena, because suchness—the true nature of the en­tirety of samsara and nirvana—is undifferentiable, and because the tathágata disposition—the naturally pure dharmadhátu—exists in all sentient beings as being suitable to be purified from the obscurations, all beings possess the ultimate buddha heart in an uninterrupted man­ner at all times since beginningless [time]. As the Bhagavàn said in the [Tathâgatagarbha Jsütra:Sentient beings always have the tathágata heart.2766Here, in due order, the great Ngog Lotsàwa explains [the first three lines of 1.28] as the fruitional, the natural, and the causal sugata heart. The"},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 881first one—the dharmakaya—is the actual Tathagata but the nominal heart of sentient beings. It pervades sentient beings because it is suit­able to be attained by them.2767The same authors Guiding Instructions on the View o f Great Shentong M adhyamaka comments on this verse in a very similar way under the head­ing of distinguishing well between existence, nonexistence, and so on, and pointing them out in accordance with the third turning of the wheel of dharma and the vajrayâna, once any suitable samâdhi of calm abiding and superior insight has arisen. In this context, the verse is explained in connec­tion with two famous stanzas from the Lankâvatàrasütra as follows:By relying on mere mind,One does not imagine outer objects.By relying on nonappearance,One should go beyond mere mind too.By relying on the focal object of actual reality,One must go beyond nonappearance.If yogins rest in nonappearance,They do not see the mahàyàna.2768[Thus,] the realization that the mistakenness of the seeming is mere mind is scrutinized by the Madhyamaka without appearances. Going beyond even that, through the Madhyamaka with appearances, one must engage in the unmistaken way of being of true reality.Here, you may wonder, “What is the focal object of actual reality?” Just as there are no four elements that are not pervaded by space, there are no knowable objects that are not pervaded by the dharmakàya of buddhas. Also, in the suchness of buddhas, oneself, and all sentient beings, there are no distinctions of good and bad, big and small, high and low, and so on. Furthermore, the naturally abiding disposition or the basic element that is able to produce the buddha attributes and has been obtained through the nature of phenomena since beginningless time exists in all living beings who consist of the life-force breath. Therefore, all sentient beings possess the tathagata heart. In order to bring that to mind clearly, recite [Uttaratantra 1.28]:"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"882 Appendix 1Since the perfect buddhakàya radiates,Since suchness is undifferentiable,And since the disposition exists,All beings always possess the buddha heart.2769Mipham RinpocheMipham Rinpoches commentary on the Uttaratantra and Synopsis o f the Sugata H eart were both compiled by Shechen Gyaltsab, Gyurmé Pema Namgyal, based on the notes of Mipham Rinpoches teachings (these notes were later edited by Mipham himself). The commentary’s explanation of Uttaratantra 1.28 consists exclusively of excerpts from the Synopsis2770 which is by far the most detailed explanation of this verse in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist literature.The Synopsis starts by saying that buddha nature is the quintessence and the most profound intent of all the Buddha’s teachings of sütra and tan­tra.2771 Some of these teachings elucidate the essence (ngo bo) of the dhar- madhàtu that is the tathagata heart by way of teaching emptiness, while some others elucidate the nature (rang bzhin) of this tathàgata heart by way of teaching it as being primordially endowed with qualities such as the ten powers. This essence and nature must be a unity without contra­diction. However, under the sway of lacking trust in the very profound es­sential point of the inseparability of the two realities, some assert that the tathagata heart is something permanent and really established that is not empty of a nature, while others hold that it is nothing but bare emptiness that cannot be posited as being primordially endowed with the inseparable qualities of kâyas and wisdoms, thus getting stuck on the side of denial and views about extinction. Though these people make all kinds of noises of refutation and affirmation in the hope of establishing their respective claims, the fortunate ones who are embraced by the pith instructions of a guru rest in the state of trusting the actuality of the noncontradictory unity of the empty expanse and luminous wisdom through having destroyed any biased clinging to either of the extremes of appearance and emptiness.According to them, in general, the valid words of the Tathagata are the undeceiving and correct scriptures. However, to ascertain their validity, these scriptures are analyzed in a general way in terms of their being pure through the three kinds of analysis.2772 In particular, it is by way of the lack of invalidation through reasoning and the existence of correct means of proof that the literal meaning of certain scriptures must be taken to be their definitive meaning. It is not sufficient to throw out reasoning as the"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 883means of assessing the purity of a scripture and simply believe whatever is said. For it is undeniable that there are both fake and authentic scriptures and that the latter entail the distinction between expedient and definitive meanings. Therefore, irreversible trust arises in those ordinary beings who, having cut through doubts by study and reflection, are able to ascertain the points to be engaged by means of the three kinds of valid cognition.2773 Conversely, if one is neither able to ascertain something through ones own valid cognition nor able to establish it for some other opponents, through just claiming certain things without any proof, one is not able to give rise to trust in oneself or others.W hen the proofs for the ways in which buddha nature is taught are as­sessed by casting away biased clinging and with an honest mind through pure reasonings, both the assertion that the tathágata heart is something permanent and really established that is not empty of a nature as well as the claim that it is a bare emptiness that lacks any qualities can be seen to lack any proof but entail logical invalidations. On the other hand, for the actual tathágata heart, whose essence is empty, whose nature consists of being primordially endowed with qualities, and which exists in the basic element of beings, no invalidations but the existence of correct proofs can be seen. These proofs consist of the three reasons in Uttaratantra 1.28. In order to determine these through reasoning, Mipham Rinpoche (A) reports first what others say and then (B) presents the Nyingma School’s authentic own way of explanation.(A) According to Mipham Rinpoche, the usual brief glosses on the three reasons in Uttaratantra 1.28 by other commentators do not penetrate the essential point of this text’s explanation of buddha nature. A common in­terpretation by others is that the dharmakáya (whether it is regarded as emptiness or wisdom) pervades all objects, that the suchness of buddhas and sentient beings is of the same type in being nothing but emptiness, and that the existence of the disposition refers to nothing but the suitability or potential to become a buddha.However, as for the first reason, the disposition that actually fulfills this definition is not established merely through the dharmakáya s pervading all objects. That buddha wisdom, which appears to be contained in someone else’s mind stream, pervades objects goes for all entities. However, the mere fact that this buddha wisdom pervades all entities is not a sufficient reason for all of these entities’ becoming buddhas. On the other hand, since the dharmakáya in one’s own mind stream has not become manifest at present, the reason “because the buddhakáya radiates” is doubtful."},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"884 Appendix 1As for the second reason, a mere nominal emptiness lacks any mean­ing of “the disposition.” If those who claim such assert that this dispo­sition represents the suitability or potential to newly become a buddha when conjoined with the conditions of the path despite not having any buddha qualities whatsoever at present (just like a seeds being transformed into a sprout), such a feature of potential transformation is not tenable in the emptiness of real existence (an aspect that is an isolate consisting of a nonimplicative negation), which is an unconditioned phenomenon that is empty of the ability to perform a function. This is similar to the aspect of a conditioned seeds conventionally being suitable to transform into a sprout, but it is impossible for the aspect of a seeds lack of real existence to ever transform into a sprout. Furthermore, it is nonsense to claim that the suitability or potential to become a buddha is established through the point of being empty of real existence. It is true that if the mind were really established, it would lack the suitability or potential to become a buddha, but the mere fact of being something that is not really established cannot produce certainty about its becoming a buddha. Though all phenomena such as earth and rocks also lack real existence, who is able to establish that everything that lacks real existence has the suitability or potential to become a buddha? Likewise, to posit the disposition solely due to the ability to relinquish the obscurations by focusing on the lack of real existence is nonsense. According to those who claim such, merely focusing on empti­ness is not a sufficient cause to relinquish the cognitive obscurations, but this focusing must be further adorned by infinite accumulations of merit (see Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen below on Uttaratantra 1.154). Thus, to as­sert that such a nonimplicative negation is “the sugata heart” is meaning­less. It would at most just represent a disposition that is in common with sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, but this nonimplicative negation does not establish the suitability or potential to become a buddha for the following reasons. One cannot justify the occurrence of omniscient wisdom in this mere nonimplicative negation after the cognitive obscurations have been relinquished. Since a nonimplicative negation’s own nature lacks any cog­nitive capacity, it is impossible for it to cognize anything whatsoever even at the time of supposedly being a buddha.Therefore, if one is fond of the dispositions having the character of transforming and being conditioned, rather than asserting a nonimplicative negation as the disposition, it is better to assert it to be a seed of knowledge, loving-kindness, and power that exists in the mind streams of all beings since beginningless time (even wild beasts and so on possess love for their"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra L2 7 -2 8 885offspring, and recognize benefit and harm, and so on) and represents the mere suitability or potential to become a buddha endowed with immeasur­able knowledge, loving-kindness, and power, when it is further developed through being conjoined with the path and thus is freed from obstacles. Once the disposition needs to be a cause that actually produces a result, to disregard its being a productive cause that is a momentary entity and assert an unconditioned and unproductive nonentity as a cause is indeed amazing.Some people think, “Everything that lacks real existence is not the dis­position but only the lack of real existence that is the nature of the mind is tenable as the disposition.” Even if the disposition were the lack of real existence of the mind, it would still not be able to perform the slightest activity of producing. Since only moments of mind are suitable to produce later such moments, an unconditioned disposition is obviously not needed by these people, so they should get rid of it.Some may think, “The disposition is not posited through distinguish­ing the two realities. Rather, the disposition is asserted as the basic nature that is the inseparability of mind’s lucidity (the bearer of the true nature; chos can) and emptiness (the true nature, chos nyid).” If this is also asserted as the unconditioned and unchanging wisdom in the dichotomy of con­sciousness and wisdom, it is indeed correct because it is established as such through scriptures and reasoning. However, to have in mind that the bearer of the true nature of emptiness, which is to be in union with emptiness, is the aspect that is momentary consciousness and then to think that this con­sciousness gradually transforms into buddhahood is meaningless because it would follow that the disposition has both a conditioned and an uncon­ditioned aspect. If that were the case, something unconditioned that has no purpose or capacity would just be the nominal disposition and something conditioned would be the disposition that actually fulfills this definition in that it is capable of producing its result. Consequently, this amounts to nothing but casting out the true intention of all mahàyàna sütras that assert the unconditioned naturally abiding disposition to be the dharmadhâtu. Therefore, without being able to mentally let go of a disposition that is posited by way of a producing cause and produced result, though one may speak of the pure dharmadhâtu as being the naturally abiding disposition, this is simply blatant evidence of one’s own actual opinion and one’s words being contradictory.Hence, once one asserts that the unchanging dharmadhâtu is the buddha disposition, one must first identify the essence of the basis that is designated as “dharmadhâtu,” which is the nonnominal ultimate—the great union of"},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"886 Appendix 1the two realities that is the actuality of the utterly nonabiding Madhyamaka. W ithout identifying this essence, if one asserts just the nominal ultimate as the disposition, one takes what is not the dharmadhátu as being the dharma­dhátu, just as when confusing a group of monkeys in the forest for the gods in a divine realm. Thus, all presentations that assert this nominal ultimate as being the buddha disposition, assert a familiarization with prajñápáramitá through focusing on this kind of ultimate, assert this ultimate to be the cause of the svábhávikakáya, and so on, are established as being the path of fake maháyána, which is also stated in the prajñápáramitá sütras and others.Therefore, what is called “the naturally pure dharmadhátu” and “empti­ness” is the actuality of the expanse of the inseparability of the two realities that is free from the entire web of reference points and is to be personally experienced. All maháyána sütras and all commentaries on their true in­tention say that this is what represents the buddha disposition that actually fulfills this definition and will become the svábhávikakáya endowed with twofold purity. Consequently, this naturally abiding disposition can only be asserted as being unconditioned. Once it is something unconditioned, it is not tenable that it, by virtue of its very own nature, performs the activity of producing a result that is other than it and then ceases. Hence, the qualities of the dharmakáya cannot be asserted as anything but a result of freedom or separation (from adventitious stains). That this is the case is declared by the great tenth-bhümi bodhisattva Maitreya in his Uttaratantra, and it is also clearly stated by the glorious protector Nágárjuna in his Dharmadhátustava. Thus, by following these texts, our own system is to assert the unconditioned dharmadhátu as the disposition. Though this dharmadhátu is the basic na­ture of all phenomena, its essence is that it lacks arising and ceasing and it has the character of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness but is without any bias. Since all conditioned phenomena, which appear to be aris­ing and ceasing, are not established in the way they appear, they never affect the fundamental ground of the dharmadhátu. Consequently, the causes and results of samsára are primordially pure and are beyond meeting with, or parting from, the appearances of uncontaminated spontaneously present luminosity. It is through this essential point that the mode of being of the tathágata heart must be identified in an unmistaken manner.(B) As for presenting our own system, (1) the meaning of Uttaratan­tra 1.28a (“because the perfect buddhakáya radiates”) is that the ultimate káya of a completely perfect buddha—the dharmakáya—whose qualities are equal to the extent of space becomes clearly manifest (gsal), radiates ('phro), or is revealed (mngon du gyur) at a later point from the mind stream"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 887of an ordinary person who previously possessed all fetters. Therefore, it is established that the tathágata heart exists in the mind streams of sentient beings at present.This is justified in two ways—common and uncommon. As for the first one, if there is a sentient being who manifests the wisdom dharmakáya, the disposition of being suitable to become a buddha necessarily exists in the mind of this being because such is untenable in anything that absolutely lacks this disposition. As verse 11 of the Dharmadhàtustava says:If this element exists, through our work,We will see the purest of all gold.Without this element, despite our toil,Nothing but misery we will produce.As for the uncommon justification, one may think, “The above justification establishes that the mind of such a being is the mere cause of being suitable to become a buddha, just as it is suitable for a harvest to arise in a field. However, how does one establish the special disposition that is primordially endowed with the buddha qualities?” This is established as follows. The buddhas possess the wisdom káya that has the character of being unconditioned because it is established through scriptures and reasonings that they do not have the nature of being conditioned and impermanent. As for the scriptures, the Mahâparinirvânasütra says:0 monk Excellent Discipline, it is better to become a tlrthika and die than saying that the unconditioned Tathágata is the conditioned Tathágata.277,1And:O son of good family, now see the Tathágata as the permanent káya, the indestructible káya, the vajrakáya, not a body of flesh, and the dharmakáya.2775And:It is better to touch this blazing pile of wood with your tongue and die than say that the Tathágata is impermanent. You should not listen to these words.2776"},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"888 Appendix 1As for the mere aspect of a nonimplicative negation s not being suitable as nirvana, this scripture also says:Even when searching for what is called “emptiness,” “emptiness,” there is nothing to be found.

This is the Tathagata.2778The Vajracchedika also states:Those who see me by way of form And those who follow me by way of sound Have engaged in the wrong approach—Such persons do not see me.The buddhas are seen by way of the dharma—The guides are dharmakaya indeed.Since the nature of phenomena is not cognizable,One is not able to cognize it.2779As illustrated by these and other passages, this is taught extensively in all sutras of definitive meaning.As for the reasonings that the wisdom dharmakaya is unconditioned, if omniscient wisdom—the ultimate fruition that is of equal taste and not dual with the primordial dharmadhatu—were something impermanent that is newly formed by causes and conditions, this would entail many flaws such as the absurd consequences that it is not self-arisen wisdom, has not relinquished the problem of change, entails the aspects of repeated ceasing and repeated arising, is deceiving due to disintegrating by its own nature, is not the absolute refuge because of ceasing as soon as it arises and because of abiding only as something limited where the collection of its causes is complete, is not of equal taste in all phenomena, has not tran­scended all extremes, does not lack phenomena such as the birth that is of a mental nature, and is a formational dependent phenomenon due to"},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 889lacking independence. Thus, such a claim would entail the enormous flaw of regarding the vajrakaya as being impermanent.Therefore, casting away this bad path, the kaya of nondual wisdom is to be regarded as unconditioned and genuinely permanent. Nevertheless, through evaluating this merely by reasonings that rely on the perspective of ordinary beings, some think, “Unconditioned wisdom is impossible be­cause a common locus of cognition and what is permanent is impossible.” Though the limited cognitions that cognize objects are necessarily imper­manent, the wisdom in which what cognizes and what is cognized are of equal taste—“the vajra of spaces pervading space”—is not like that. For it is established through a reasoning consciousness that analyzes for the ultimate that there is primordially no arising or ceasing in the essence of that wisdom because all phenomena of nirvana and samsara are contained within the state of the unchanging luminosity that is the self-radiance (rang gdangs) of the unconditioned. Consequently, this kind of wisdom is the great unconditioned that does not abide in either of the extremes of being conditioned and unconditioned. It is absolutely not like a sheer nonentity. Since both entities and nonentities are bearers of the nature of phenomena and arise in mutual dependence or are labeled in mutual dependence, if analyzed correctly, they are conditioned, hollow, fake, delusive, and decep­tive. On the other hand, the tathagata heart is the great unconditioned true nature of all phenomena that consist of entities and nonentities, which is perfectly undeceiving. As the M ulam adhyam akakarika says:A nature is not artificialAnd does not depend on anything else.2780And:Entities and nonentities are conditioned.Nirvana is unconditioned.2781Hence, once the ultimate wisdom of the dharmakaya is established through the scriptures that are the sutras of definitive meaning and the reasonings that analyze for the ultimate as pervading all of samsara and nirvana, equality, the unconditioned, and the unchanging nature of the ultimate, the nature of this wisdom dharmakaya abides at present in all mind streams that are suitable for its becoming manifest at some time, and it does so without decrease or increase and in the manner of being the true"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"890 Appendix 1nature of these mind streams. From the perspective of the way in which it appears to be free or not to be free from the adventitious stains, it appears to be manifest or not manifest. However, from the perspective of the way things are, there is not even the slightest difference in terms of before and after or better and worse because it has the nature of being unchanging and unconditioned. The Uttaratantra states:Its true nature of being changeless Is the same before as after.2782And:The luminous nature of the mind Is completely unchanging, just like space.It is not afflicted by adventitious stains,Such as desire, born from false imagination.2783Thus, all samsaric phenomena are changing and not stable. Though they all appear as if transforming within the state of the nature of phenomena, it should be understood that, as is said again and again, that the purity of the mind—the tathagata heart—is without any transformation, just like space. In this way, the unconditioned expanse of luminosity is never tainted by mistakenness but is naturally pure. The spontaneously present fruitional qualities such as the powers abide within this unmistaken self-radiant basic nature without being separable from it, just like the sun and its rays. The Uttaratantra says:The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable dharmas,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.2784All flaws of samsara arise from the mistaken mind that clings to a personal self and an identity of phenomena. Since this mistaken mind from the beginning neither taints nor mixes with the luminosity that is the primordial ground, but is adventitious like clouds in the sky, these flaws can be distinguished from the basic element and are suitable to be removed from it. Therefore, the essence of the basic element is empty of these flaws, that is, it is untainted by them. However, this basic element is not empty"},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 891of the ultimate qualities that cannot be separated from the self-arising wisdom that does not depend on being affected by mistakenness but, all on its own, is luminous and operates as the true reality of all phenomena. In its own essence, it is the fundamental ground from which these qualities are inseparable, just like the sun and its rays.If the naturally abiding disposition is established as the unconditioned essence of the dharmakaya that is primordially endowed with the qualities, since this is suitable to be buddhahood, the wisdom dharmakaya must re­side in the mind streams of all sentient beings without decrease or increase. It is established by the power of entities (dngos stobs) that it is suitable to become a buddha if one has cultivated the path. Since the dharmakaya at the time of buddhahood is unconditioned, it is impossible for it to be newly conditioned by causes and conditions. Therefore, it is established that it abides as buddha nature at present.Regarding this, some people think, “If the dharmakaya abides at pres­ent as buddha nature, why does that omniscient wisdom not dispel the obscurations of the sentient beings in which it abides?” Also, clinging to the theories of the common yana, they think, “Since a buddha is the result and a sentient being is the cause, if the result is present in the cause, this is invalidated by reasonings such as eating food absurdly entailing eating excrement.” Having been guided by merely an understanding of the com­mon scriptures, it is no wonder that such qualms arise in those who have not trained in the meaning of the extremely profound sutras of definitive meaning. Still, what they say is not the case. Though the nature of phe­nomena that is luminous wisdom exists in everything without distinction, when the adventitious mistakenness of ones own mind arises, the basis of designation of samsara is only this mistaken mind together with its objects, but this mistakenness does not know the nature of phenomena that exists in oneself as it is. For example, when sleeping, it is due to the power of con­sciousness alone that infinite appearances such as a body, objects, and an eye-consciousness arise. At that time, the mental consciousness apprehends and observes subject and object separately, but this mental consciousness itself is not able to know its own actual mode of being of apprehender and apprehendeds not being established as different. However, even though it does not know its actual mode of being, there is nothing in it that is other than this actual mode of being. Likewise, though all phenomena abide as emptiness, merely being emptiness does not entail that everyone realizes this because there is the possibility of the mistakenness in which the way things appear and the way they are do not accord. Consequently, since the"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"892 Appendix 1wisdom of buddha nature and mind are the true nature and what bears this nature, respectively, buddhas and sentient beings are taught in terms of the way things are and the way they appear, respectively. Hence, to bring forth invalidations by reasoning such as the results already existing in the cause simply means not to understand the thesis here.Thus, this first reasoning here in Uttaratantra 1.28 establishes through the reason of the clear manifestation of the dharmakaya at the time of the result that the disposition that is primordially endowed with the qualities exists at the time of the cause. From the perspective of how things actually are, there is no earlier cause or later result as far as buddha nature is con­cerned, but from the perspective of how things (mistakenly) appear, one needs to present this process in terms of cause and result. Therefore, the result of the future manifestation of the dharmakaya in a being proves the prior existence of the cause that is the disposition in that being, which is called “the principle of dependence.”2785(2) As for the second reason in Uttaratantra I.28b (“because suchness is undifferentiable”), since all phenomena of samsára and nirvana are undifferentiable and of one taste within emptiness or suchness—great primordial luminosity—buddhas and sentient beings too are ultimately un- differentiable, which is the equality of samsára and nirvana. Therefore, it is established through “the principle of the nature of phenomena” that even what is projected by adventitious mistakenness and looks like a sentient being does not move even an inch from the ultimate nature of phenom­ena. Therefore, it is certain that these sentient beings possess the buddha heart. Having in mind all phenomena, the sutras also speak of their pri­mordially being luminosity, nirvana, and the nature of completely perfect buddhahood.One may think, “But as was explained to others above, if the existence of the disposition is established merely by everything’s being undifferentiable as suchness, it follows that the disposition also exists in earth, rocks, and so on.” If what is called “the disposition” must be presented as the infallible cause of buddhahood, which is the complete relinquishment of the two obscurations under the sway of a mistaken m ind and thus the unfolding of m inds being unmistaken about the nature of what is to be known, any practice of the path to accomplish the result of buddhahood is absent in what is not mind, that is, matter such as earth and rocks. Therefore, even though conventionally matter is undifferentiable from mind as suchness, there is no need to posit that the disposition exists in matter. Also, stones and such equally appear through the power of the m ind—it is not that"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 893mind arises through the power of external stones and such. This is to be understood through the example of the relationship between appearances in a dream and the consciousness during that dream.Through understanding that the nature of phenomena—the sugata heart, which has the nature of ultimate uncontaminated virtue—resides in this mind that is the creator of the three realms, just as wetness is inher­ent in water, the appearances of samsára and nirvana are merely the play of consciousness and wisdom and therefore do not need to be different. We emphatically assert that, in actual reality, all appearances, which do not stray from the natural state of the nature of phenomena that is primordial buddhahood, do not go beyond the mode of being of a tathagata. The Pra- jñápüramitásamcayagathü says:The purity of form should be known as the purity of the fruition.The purity of form and the fruition represents the purity of omniscience.The purity of omniscience and the fruition as well as the purity of form,Similar to the element of space, are inseparable and indivisible.2786Accordingly, the purity of the subject liberated from the obscurations is the purity or the nature of objects, such as form, because apart from the mere manner of seeing the process of progressively becoming free from the obscurations that are ones own appearances, their actual nature abides as being primordially free from obscurations. Therefore, when one has become a buddha through the stains of the basic element that is the disposition (the subject) having been exhausted, no impure entities that are objects remain as leftovers, just as blurred vision is automatically cleared when an eye disorder is cured.Someone may think, “But this means that when one person becomes a buddha, all impure appearances cease.” This is not the case because the seeing of the way things are and the way they appear being contradictory is due to the obscurations that are each person s own individual appearances obscuring these persons themselves (and no one else). One may think, “On the buddhabhümi, on which the way things are and the way they appear ac­cord in all respects, do buddhas then have or not have impure appearances? If they have, all phenomena have not become fully perfect buddhahood. If they do not have impure appearances, it is impossible for buddhas to know the paths that lead everywhere in samsára and nirvána2787 and so forth.” It is from within the state of these phenomena’s being of equal taste with omni­scient wisdom that this omniscient wisdom effortlessly and spontaneously"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"894 Appendix 1knows all possible phenomena of samsara and nirvana. While it, from its own perspective, does not go beyond seeing everything as great purity, it also sees the appearances of the six classes of beings in accordance with the ways in which they individually appear. Due to the power of all ob­scurations of the dualistic appearances of subject and object having been exhausted, all the many bearers of the nature of phenomena are encom­passed in an unmixed and complete way within the expanse of the nature of phenomena. Through this essential point, they are simultaneously seen by the wisdom of equal taste that is free from arising and ceasing. Let alone ordinary beings with their limited perception, this is difficult to fathom even for those who dwell on the bhumis. This principle is explained in the Bodhisattvapitaka:The equality of all phenomena is realized To be equal by self-arisen [wisdom].Therefore, the seeing of the tathagatas,The fully perfect buddhas, is equal.And:By virtue of knowing the natural luminosity of mind as it is, therefore, this is called “fully and completely awakening into unsurpassable truly perfect awakening through the prajna that is a single instant of mind.”Accordingly, master Candraklrti says:Just as there are no divisions in space by virtue of the divisions of vessels, There are no divisions of entities whatsoever in true reality.Therefore, if you fully comprehend their being of equal taste,You with excellent knowledge understand [all] knowable objects in an instant.2788Thus, the great wisdom that is nondual with the expanse pervades all phenomena, and its effortless seeing pervades them in the manner of the moon and stars’ appearing in the ocean. This seeing from within the state of all conceptions being at utter peace is so due to the power of self-arisen luminous wisdom—the nature of phenomena that resides in the ground— having become manifest as it is after all obscurations have become exhausted. Therefore, if one relies on the correct principle of the nature"},{"pageNumber":911,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 895of phenomena in the context of analyzing for the ultimate, irreversible trust is found. Otherwise, when this is evaluated with a narrow mind, we witness the rise of a lot of contradictions and impurities of imagination, such as assertions that wisdom does not exist on the buddhabhümi, or, even if it does, it is established as being just like an ordinary mind that entails change; assertions that buddhas do not see the realms of sentient beings or that buddhahood entails impure appearances; and the inability to establish the natures of the wisdom that knows suchness and the wisdom that knows variety as being of equal taste.(3) As for the third reason in Uttaratantra I.28c (“because of the dispo­sition”), all sentient beings have the disposition of being suitable to become buddhas since the adventitious stains are established to be relinquishable, while the dharmakaya that is primordially endowed with the qualities is established to exist without any difference in all beings. If sentient beings have such a disposition of being suitable to become buddhas, it is certain that they possess the buddha heart because there is a situation of actually becoming buddhas for them and the dharmakaya of a buddha is uncondi­tioned in nature, therefore lacking any differences in its nature in terms of being worse before or better after.Through this third reasoning, one understands that a result is produced from a cause, which is “the principle of performing activity.” Here, this is not just inferring that a result comes forth through the mere existence of the cause, which is due to the following essential points: the disposition that is suchness (the nature of phenomena) is changeless; at the time of the fru­ition, its nature is still without being better or worse; since the adventitious stains are always separable from it, no matter how long they have been as­sociated with it, it is impossible for this disposition to ever lose its capacity or power to become buddhahood.Thus, to briefly summarize these three reasons in Uttaratantra 1.28, (1) the existence of the cause—the disposition—is not distinct in nature from the dharmakaya at the time of the fruition. (2) If the dharmakaya at the time of the fruition exists, it must also exist without increase or decrease at the time of sentient beings. (3) Although there are the imputations of cause and result as well as before and after, in actuality, the dharmadhatu is of one taste as the unchanging essence. Through these three reasons, it is established that all sentient beings possess the tathagata heart, which is the outcome of the path of correct reasoning that operates through the power of entities."},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"896 Appendix 1In this way, through these reasonings that establish that a tathagata ex­ists in all sentient beings, ultimate liberation, the state of a tathagata, and the ultimate basic nature of all phenomena are established as not being dif­ferent. If one understands that this liberation and buddhahood have arisen through the power of the tathagata heart, it is also established that there is only a single yána ultimately. Otherwise, in the systems of those who turn their back on the maháyána (such as those who say that the tathagata heart does not exist in the basic element of sentient beings, that it does not exist at the time of buddhahood, and that it lacks any qualities at the time of the cause, while it newly possesses the qualities at the time of the result), the reasonings to establish a single yána ultimately are just empty verbiage. Hence, those who aspire for the topics of the supreme yána should greatly train their intelligence in this topic.Thus, since the presentation that the basic element that is primordially endowed with the qualities exists at the time of sentient beings is a profound and inconceivable topic, even the Buddha spoke about it to his audiences in a manner so that they should trust what he says and said that though it is undeceiving, it is difficult to understand through ones own power. There­fore, since it is taught as the ultimate of what is profound, small-minded dialecticians continuously dispute it, but no matter how many qualms that rely on conventions they may bring up, such as the consequence that there would be a mind that is a common locus of the mind of a buddha and a sentient being, they are all nonsense. The Samdhinirmocanasütra states:The defining characteristic of the conditioned realms and the ultimate Is their defining characteristic of being free from being one and different. Those who think of them in terms of oneness and difference Have engaged them in an improper manner.2789Accordingly, there is no need to claim that mind’s true nature—the basic element that is the tathágata heart—and the mind that is the bearer of this nature are either the same or different. Not only is it not contradictory that this mind does not go beyond its true nature (the way things are) and that mistakenness (the way things appear) is still possible, but otherwise there would be flaws such as there being no liberation and it being impossible for any being to be mistaken. Because there is the discordance between the way things are and the way they appear, the possibility of mistaken sentient beings as well as the existence of buddhas after these beings"},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 897have relinquished their mistakenness through having entered the path is established.Though all phenomena are established as emptiness through the rea­sonings that analyze for the ultimate, they do not negate the qualities of the tathagata heart because those who follow the teachings on buddha nature also accept that, though these unsurpassable qualities exist, their nature is empty. Therefore, the meaning taught by the middle wheel of dharma that all afflicted and purified phenomena are empty is established in that way because the tathagata heart too is the nature of emptiness. However, the teaching on the tathagata heart that is specified by being inseparable from the appearances of the kàyas and wisdoms whose nature is empty is the true intention of the sütras of definitive meaning of the final wheel of dharma. Therefore, it is merely by virtue of this principle that this teach­ing is superior to the middle wheel of dharma. Consequently, the Samdhi- nirmocanasütras praise of the meaning of the final wheel of dharma does not refer to everything that is included in the final wheel of dharma, but this praise is pronounced in the way it is from the perspective of the defin­itive meaning of the teachings on the tathagata heart. One is able to ascer­tain this in such a way through other sütra passages, such as those that teach the basic element through the example of cleansing a jewel. Therefore, the emptiness taught in the middle wheel of dharma and the kâyas and wis­doms taught in the last wheel of dharma need to be integrated as the unity of appearance and emptiness. Consequently, without dividing or excluding the sections of definitive meaning in the middle and last wheels of dharma, both should be taken as being of definitive meaning, just as this is asserted by the omniscient Longchen Rabjam. If one takes both of them to be of definitive meaning, there is not only no contradiction that one of them must be taken as being of expedient meaning, but, through having unified them as the tathagata heart and thus taking this tathagata heart to have the meaning of the causal tantra, it also comes forth as the essential point of the pith instructions of the vajrayàna.Therefore, one should understand that the teachings of the Buddha come down to this single essential point. The noble ones such as Nàgàrjuna and Asanga are of a single mind with regard to this final meaning because such can be clearly realized through Nàgàrjuna s Dharmadhâtustava, Bodhi- cittavivarana, and so on, as well as Asangas commentary on the Uttaratan­tra and so forth.

Therefore, there are no grounds for engaging in qualms that are based on the ultimate.Dongag Tenpé NyimaDongag Tenpé Nyimas notes on Mipham Rinpoches Synopsis follow the latters matching of the first three lines of Uttaratantra 1.28 with the prin­ciples of dependence, the nature of phenomena, and performing activity, respectively, and refers to them as result, nature, and cause, respectively.2791 He adds that the first reason is a result reason ('bras b u i rtags), while the latter two are nature reasons (rang bzhin gyi rtags). Also, when it is said that “sentient beings are buddhas,” this refers only to buddhahood in the sense of natural purity (but not in the sense of being endowed with twofold purity). Therefore, it speaks about the true nature of the mind but not its result. Hence, there is no flaw of the result s already abiding in the cause (as in the Sámkhya system).Surmang Padma NamgyalThe Kagyü scholar Surmang Padma Namgyals (twentieth century) Full M oon o f Questions and Answers explains Uttaratantra 1.28 through linking it with all four principles and even adding the nine examples for buddha nature in the Uttaratantra.2792 He says that the first line proves the cause by way of the result, applying the principle of performing activity and exam­ples 1-3. As for the second line, the true nature of buddhas and sentient beings is the same and without any distinction of purity and impurity, re­ferring to the principle of the nature of phenomena and example 4. The third line shows that the result of the three kayas depends on both the nat­urally abiding and the unfolding dispositions, thus applying the principle of dependence and examples 5-9 (the principle of demonstrating evidence is said to be contained implicitly in all three lines)."},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.2 7 -2 8 899Ngawang Kunga W angchugThe contemporary Sakya scholar Ngawang Kunga Wangchug’s commen­tary on the Abhisamayàlamkâra says that the Mâdhyamikas explain the nature of the disposition in many ways, such as being the dharmakâya, the dharmadhâtu, or mind.2793 However, its own fully complete nature is stated in Uttaratantra 1.28. Among the first three lines of this verse, “Since the perfect buddhakàya radiates” refers to what is suitable for the condition of the Buddha s enlightened activity engaging it. “Since suchness is undif- ferentiable” indicates what is suitable for relinquishing the adverse condi­tions of the obscurations. “And because of the disposition” teaches what is suitable for the arising of all buddha qualities as the fruition. Thus, these three points are complete in both the sugata heart and the buddha dispo­sition. However, in order to present it as the sugata heart, all three must be complete, while they need not be complete in order to present it as the dis­position because the disposition itself represents one of these three points.In brief, the definition of the sugata heart at the time of its being a cause is “the dharmadhâtu that is suitable for (a) the condition of the Buddhas enlightened activity engaging it, (b) relinquishing the adverse conditions of the obscurations, and (c) all buddha qualities arising as its fruition.

Through the power of the latent tendencies of ignorance, [the dharmadhatu] manifests in the form of the container and its content [the outer world and the beings therein]. Likewise, it [can very well] serve as the basis for ones own welfare and that of others, just as our consciousness in dreams [can manifest in different ways]. As for [the relationship of] the latent tendencies of ig­norance and the nature of the dharmadhatu without beginning and end, the latent tendencies of ignorance are like being impregnated with [some scent,] such as musk.

In order to support this statement, he quotes four works by MzitreyeL— Madhyântavibhâga 1.1-2 and I.8ab (as well as paraphrasing 1.13), M ahâyânasütrâlamkâra XI.15-23 together with its BhâsyayAbhisamayâlamkâra V.20-21, as well as Uttaratantra 1.154 and R G W .

Since there is nothing in the first place, what could be taken away by us? Since what is unreal is removed, what else called “obscuration” is seen? Nor is there anything to be added, which refers to anything that is not manifest­ing lucidly, such as the mental aspects of apprehender and apprehended or a self. The refutation of denial is that actual reality is to be apprehended as this actual reality and not as what is not actual reality. The refutation of superimposition is that one should have confidence in actual reality as being this actual reality and not in what is not actual reality as being ac­tual reality. The perfect distinction between what is actual reality and what is not actual reality is stated in Madhyântavibhâga 1.13, which says that, following the characteristics of what exists and what does not exist, one realizes that duality is not actual reality, while what bears the property of the emptiness of duality (dvayasünyatâdharmin) is true actuality because it is the sole agent. Or, “from it” refers to what is directly perceived, which is actual reality because it is worthy of nothing’s being added to it. Every­thing else is not actual reality because it is merely imaginary (kalpitamdtra). Therefore, the emptiness of that is said to be actual reality. Consequently, whoever directly perceives or apprehends actual reality is liberated. This means that one is liberated through progressive and repeated study and"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"906 Appendix 2reflection. What is free from superimposition and denial is the principle of the middle (madhyama sthitih). There is no actual difference in saying that precisely this is also the view of Yogacara.Next, after identifying the wrong positions of superimposition and de­nial, Jnanasrlmitra cites Uttaratantra 1.154 and R G W and explains that real aspects are mental forms that have the nature of being appearances of lucidity (prakasarupa),2803 which he equates with buddha nature (the tathagatadhatu). Just as this tathagatadhatu, those lucid forms are free from all superimposition and denial.However, some superimpose here [onto the existence of real aspects] a perception without aspects in terms of persons and so on as well as that [this real aspect] is an [actual] apprehended [referent] and so on even while [that real aspect] is lucidly manifest [as such an aspect]. Some [others] deny [a real aspect] either entirely or partly even while [this real aspect] is not lucidly manifest. The basis of these two [kinds of] persons is contradictory. The cause of their mutual contentions [amounts] to meaninglessness. Therefore, the [correct position] is the very principle of emptiness. As the Uttaratantra says:Those who are called “those whose minds are distracted from emptiness” refer to the bodhisattvas who have newly entered the [maha]yana and deviate from the principle of what emptiness means in the case of the tathagata heart. [Among them, there are] those who [wrongly] assert the door to liberation that is emptiness in order to destroy [really existing] entities, [thinking] that parinirvana refers to the extinction and destruction of really existing phenomena at a later time. Or, [there are] also those who resort to emptiness through focusing on emptiness [as some real entity, thinking] that what is called “emptiness” exists, by way of being distinct from form and so on, as some entity that is to be realized and with which one should familiarize.What is it that is called “the principle of what emptiness means in the case of the tathagata heart” here?There is nothing to be removed from this And not the slightest to be added."},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.1 5 4 -5 5 907Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.2804With regard to the meaning of emptiness here, the first disagreement [of denying the existence of a real aspect] is not [tenable] because the extinction of a real aspect at a later time based on its being [considered as] false [in the first place] is not agreeable. Nor is the second [disagree­ment of superimposing anything onto a real aspect tenable] because it would follow that there was [something else that is] different from [and superimposed onto this real aspect], just as in the case of an [assumed] perception without aspects and so on.“However, [RGW ] explains that there is no characteristic of af­fliction to be removed from the tathagatadhatu, nor is the slightest characteristic of purified phenomena to be added to it.” This is true. Nevertheless, since [the word] “property” (dharma) indicates a “bearer of that property” (dharmin), the term “tathagatadhatu” [(which is the dharma here) indicates phenomena] that bear the property that is emp­tiness. The apprehended is nothing but what is apprehended by the transformed mind (cittavivarta) [alone] since there is no doubt that something is projected and so on onto the mere emptiness that is con­fined within the sphere of conception. Therefore, [stating] the pair of the nonexistence of [any characteristic of] afflicted phenomena and the existence of the characteristic of purified phenomena means the ne­gation of the above-mentioned denial and superimposition since the cessation and arising [of a real aspect] are refuted. For [RGW ] says immediately after that:Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist some­where, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accordance with true reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real existent. These [two verses] elucidate the unmistaken de­fining characteristic of emptiness since it [thus] is free from the extremes of superimposition and denial.2805Therefore, this is not a negation of lucid form (prakasarupa). In­deed, this is the meaning of the middle (madhyamartha). Thus, [Madh- yantavibhaga 1.2 says]:"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"908 Appendix 2Therefore, everything is explainedTo be neither empty nor nonemptyBecause of existence, nonexistence, and existence.This is the middle path.2806Near the end of the sixth chapter,2807 Jnanasrlmitra adds that the beings to be guided are twofold—those who engage in superimposition and those who engage in denial. For the former, the Buddha taught the emptiness of all phenomena and spoke of the principle of the middle byway of negation. For the latter, he established the principle of consciousness (vijnananaya) by way of delineating the existence of mere manifold appearances (icitrapratibhasamatra).M aitrlpa’s DohakosapanjikaMaitripa’s comment on the definition of the innate nature of the mind in line 20d of Sarahas Dohakosagiti (“People Doha”) quotes Uttaratantra1.154 and explains that that in which there is nothing to be removed or to be added is innate bliss.The nature of the innate is neither existent nor nonexistent.Here, “existent” refers to any entity as it appears to the eye and so on and as it is imagined mentally. In that case, why [is the innate not ex­istent]?

As for the term “false imagination,” what is false or unreal consists of the duality of apprehender and appre­hended. One speaks of “false imagination” because imaginations about or due to this duality are entertained by subsequently arisen conceptions. In the sutras, this false imagination is explained to be the dependent nature. The word “existence” in M adhyantavibhaga I.la refutes the denial of this dependent nature and also indicates the seed for the future arising of the sambhogakaya. The term “false imagination” illustrates the consciousness at the time of being afflicted that appears as various appearances. Anything that does not appear in these appearances that are called “dependent na­ture” and is superimposed by tlrthikas and some Buddhists is referred to as the imaginary nature. Such superimpositions basically consist of the char­acteristics of apprehender and apprehended. Thus, “duality” in M adhyan- tavibhaga I.lb indicates the imaginary nature. As for I.lc, the emptiness of everything imaginary in terms of this duality exists in said false imag­ination, which indicates the seed of the abiding of the dharmakaya. This is also explained in detail in Mahdydnasutrdlamkdra XI.15ff. In the sutras, the emptiness of duality is explained to be the perfect nature. As for M adh- yantavibhaga I.ld (“In it, this also exists”), it is stated in order to prevent concerns that the effort called “false imagination” (which is the bearer of the property of emptiness) is completely unreal by virtue of its being inval­idated by valid cognition.According to Yamari, the same is expressed in Abhisamaydlamkara V.21 for the sake of showing that imaginary phenomena are by all means identi- tyless, while Uttaratantra 1.154 presents the meaning of emptiness through excluding what is other than it. Therefore, all this eliminates the position"},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"910 Appendix 2of those who assert that aspects are unreal in part or in their entirety. It also eliminates the positions of those who say that everything is unreal and those who claim that consciousness is without aspects.

In general, texts that establish consciousness as possessing aspects explain the dependent nature.Sahajavajra’s TattvadasakatikaSahajavajra comments on Maitrlpas Tattvadasaka 3cd by quoting Ut­taratantra 1.154, which he attributes directly to the Buddha.[Line 3c of the Tattvadasaka says:]Attachment is born from mistakenness.Mistakenness refers to one’s own superimpositions. Attachment is fixation. Mistakenness means what is superimposed as the nature of entities, such as existence or nonexistence. Through such [superim­positions], one fixates again and again, which here means attachment, aversion, and ignorance. “Based on what should this mistakenness be relinquished?” In order to [answer that question, line 3d] says:And mistakenness is held to be without basis.The meaning of this is that since here even the slightest arising has been negated, [removing mistakenness] is not just like extracting a thorn. Rather, it means to fully understand the nature [of mistaken­ness], and this nature is again nothing but its being unarisen. As it is [indicated] through the following words of the Bhagavan:ManjusrI, ignorance has the meaning of nonexistence.And:There is nothing to be removed from it And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Who sees actual reality is released.2816"},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.1 5 4 -5 5 911Rámapála’s Sekanirdesap añjikáRámapála (eleventh century) was another student of Maitripa.

According to the Vijñánavádins, the entity of consciousness exists, which demonstrates just a temporary form of nonconceptuality, being the nonconceptual mind that corresponds to the existence of appearances under the sway of ignorance. They cling to this nonconceptual mind as being self-awareness. But in Madhyamaka there is no eliminating or accomplishing. Even if one thinks that what has the nature of being empty of the superimpositions in terms of knowing and what is to be known is the world, conceptuality is not other than nonconceptuality. Just as this goes for not knowing all appearances as they are, it also goes for knowing true reality.

By virtue of everything’s being nonexistent, where would what be empty of what? Therefore, the emptiness [in the sense] of such [nonexistence] is not reasonable.2819 Hence, such represents a bad grasp of emptiness. So how is emptiness grasped well? Since one sees that something’s not existing somewhere [means that] the latter is empty of the former, one understands, in accordance with true reality, that what remains there really exists there. This is called “engaging emptiness un- mistakenly as it accords with true reality. . . .” Therefore, the entities about which one has notions such as form are empty of the character of the designational terms “form” and so on.What is the remainder here in these entities about which one has notions such as form? It is said to be the bases of the designational terms “form” and so on. As for these two, it is said that one under­stands, in accordance with true reality, the existence of mere entities and the mere designations as mere entities. One does not superim­pose what is not truly real, nor does one deny what is truly real. One does not create any redundancy, nor does one create any deficiency. One does not set up [anything], nor does one reject [anything]. One re­alizes, in accordance with true reality, what is in accordance with true reality—suchness, whose nature is inexpressible.2820 This is said to be a good grasp of emptiness—its being well realized through perfect pra- jna. This [description] is the one that accords with “the principle of demonstrating evidence” through which the inexpressible nature of all phenomena is to be known in an exact manner.2821Later, the text also says that those who cling to superimposing what is not truly real (the specific characteristics of designations) and those who"},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.1 5 4-55 913deny what is ultimately truly real by virtue of being inexpressible (the mere entities that are the bases of designations) have fallen away from the dharma.2822 Also, those who deny both designations and true reality are the chief nihilists, with whom those of pure conduct should not associate and who only bring misery upon themselves and others.2823Tibetan Commentaries Ngog LotsawaNgog’s Synopsis o f the “Uttaratantra” explains 1.154 in terms of the insepa­rability of the two realities, without superimposing any ultimate existence of afflicted phenomena or denying the existence of purified phenomena on the level of seeming reality.As for teaching the defining characteristic of the unmistaken meaning of being empty, [RGW ] says, “What is it that is called ‘the principle of what emptiness means in the case of the tathagata heart’ here?” Since one neither superimposes that the focal objects of afflicted phenomena exist ultimately nor denies that the focal objects of purified minds and mental factors exist on [the level of] seeming [reality], the two realities abide just as they are. This is said to be the unmistaken meaning of emptiness.As for “there is nothing to be removed in this,” in this true reality there is nothing to be removed that is a focal object of afflicted phe­nomena because [such focal objects] are not established right from the beginning. In this true reality there is not the slightest to be added that is a purified characteristic (such as the powers and supernatural knowl­edges) because the existence of the focal objects of purified phenom­ena (such as the [ten] powers) on [the level of] seeming [reality] abides since beginningless [time]. By way of not superimposing ultimate ex­istence and not denying seeming existence in this way, unmistaken ac­tual reality—the nature of the two realities in union—is taught.You may wonder, “But if one neither eliminates afflicted phenom­ena nor accomplishes purified phenomena, what is the point of en­tering the path?” It is said that [the path], through the elimination of superimposition and denial, merely makes one realize the true reality that is incompatible with such [superimposition and denial].

Furthermore, the tathagata heart is said not to be an object of four groups of persons: (1) bodhisattvas who have views about emptiness and are full of pride about that, (2) Sautrantikas, (3) Mere Mentalists, and(4) ¿ravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary beings.You may wonder, “Who is it that superimposes [something] onto the basic element or denies [something about it]?” It is the sravakas who superimpose by saying, “The afflictions exist in the dharmadhatu since the beginning” and deny by saying, “The qualities of the dharmakaya do not exist from the beginning [but] arise later.”You may wonder, “How do these two verses teach that [the basic element] is free from the pair of superimposition and denial?” This [is explained through] the subject, the thesis, and the reason [of two reasonings], as well as the elimination of a disputational flaw. As for “in this,” the subject is “in this basic element that exists at all times, exists in all sentient beings (the objects), and exists in a manner that is without difference.” The thesis is “there is nothing to be removed.” “Why?” The reason is “because the basic element is empty of what is adventitious, which has the characteristic of being separable.” [As for the second reasoning,] the subject applies again in the same way, and the thesis is “there is not the slightest to be added.” “Why?” The reason is “[because] it is not empty of the unsurpassable attributes, which have the characteristic of being inseparable.” It m aybe asked, “In that case, how is it posited that the fruition of liberation is attained through relin­quishing the afflictions and attaining the qualities of the dharmakaya?If there are no afflictions to be relinquished and no qualities of the dharmakaya to be attained at present, it follows that there is no fruition of liberation [later either].” There is no such flaw—this disputational flaw is eliminated by [the lines] “Actual reality is viewed as it really is—if actual reality is seen, one is liberated.”The commentary has three points.

(2a) As for establishing it through rea­soning, it is [first] established that [the basic element] is not an object of persons whose minds are distracted from emptiness, which consists of [R G W ’s] passage “Here, those whose minds are distracted from and stray outside of . . .” [In it, the phrase] “those whose minds are distracted outside” teaches that [the basic element] is not an object of those persons who have views about emptiness and are full of pride [about that]. [The phrase] “those who stray” teaches that [the basic el­ement] is not an object of the Sautrantikas, who assert that the five appropriating skandhas exist from the beginning and become totally nonexistent later, thus denying [something about] the fruition. [The phrase] “those who do not cultivate it in samadhi” teaches that it is not an object of the Mere Mentalists who assert a self-awareness empty of apprehender and apprehended as the ultimate and contrast it to “the wisdom of ultimate emptiness” below. The summary of these three [persons] consists of [the phrase] “those who are not one-pointed [with regard to it].” The instruction that [the basic element] is not an object of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and ordinary beings consists of [the sentence] “Without being introduced to the wisdom of ultimate emptiness...”(2b) Establishing [that the basic element is not an object of the thinking of four kinds of persons] through scripture consist of [the passage] “With this in mind, it is said . . .” Here, it is said that [this passage from] the [Srimdlddevi]sutra explicitly teaches that [the basic element] is not an object of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, with [the word] “any” [in it implicidy] teaching that it is not an object of ordi­nary beings and [bodhisattvas] whose minds are distracted from emp­tiness [either] because this appears in [RGW s] explanation of this sutra [passage].(3) The third point is the explanation of the instruction that the dharmakaya is [only] a bit of an object for bodhisattvas dwelling on the ten bhumis, which is connected [to the previous passage] as follows. You may wonder, “If this basic element that possesses such defining characteristics is not an object of these four [kinds of] persons, the ob­ject of which persons is it?” [In response] to that, in order to teach that bodhisattvas on the ten bhumis do not see it in a complete manner,"},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"916 Appendix 2while buddhas see it in a pure manner, [R G W says,] “Here, to have realized the introduction to the wisdom ..In addition, CMWs introduction comments on I.154ab that the line “there is nothing to be removed in this” refers to thoughts’ not needing to be relinquished and being pure, while the line, “not the slightest to be added” means that self-arisen wisdom dawns without needing to be accom­plished.2827 Quoting 1.155, the introduction explains that the three phases of the tathagata heart’s being impure, both impure and pure, and completely pure have the same single nature. All three of them are nothing but space­like luminosity, which is essentially disconnected from the adventitious stains of thoughts.First, through the ninefold matching of the [tathagata] heart [with its adventitious stains through the nine examples in the Uttaratantra], sentient beings (the cause) and buddhas (the fruition) are joined, that is, the three phases [of the tathagata heart’s being impure, impure and pure, and completely pure] are blended as having a single nature. The three phases are the luminosity of the dharmakaya of sentient beings (which is like the space in a clay vessel), the luminosity of the noble ones (which is like the space in a copper vessel), and the luminosity of buddhas (which is like the space in a golden vessel). As for these three [phases, the Uttaratantra says]:The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.The conditioned element that can be disconnected consists of the stains of thoughts, which are like a vessel.

Therefore, by virtue of certain conditions (such as fog or mist), in the world, one can ob­serve the statements “The sky is not pure” and “It is pure,” [when] it is clear and free [from these conditions]. However, it is not suitable to claim such because of a change of the nature of space. With its own natures being pure, empty, and unconditioned, it is indeed not in or­der for it to either become pure by virtue of itself or become pure by virtue of something else. Nevertheless, mistaken minds that connect mere conventional terms to it cling to space as being pure and impure, [but] this is nothing but an error. Likewise, though it may appear as if the naturally pure nature of phenomena—the perfect [nature]—has become free from the fog and mist of conceptions, it is not asserted that this perfect [nature] changes [in any way] —it is absolutely without any arising or ceasing in terms of itself, others, both, or neither.In the same way, the fact of golds remaining in its state of being immaculate is not changed by any stains, and the fact of waters re­maining clear and moist is not changed in its nature, even if it becomes associated with sullying factors, [such as] silt. Likewise, all that happens to the unmistaken path and the pure dharmas is that they just become associated with stains and sullying factors through the conceptions of ignorance, but it is not asserted that these uncontaminated dharmas [the path and the pure dharmas entailed by cessation] change. Conse­quently, naturally luminous stainlessness is unconditioned and change­less. Therefore, though the nature of phenomena is referred to by the conventional term “fundamental change,” it is also called “permanent.” The words “and so on” refer to its being like a buddha [statues] ex­isting in the shroud of a [decaying] lotus, honey’s existing amid bees, a grain in its husks, gold in filth, a treasure in the earth, a tree’s [sprout­ing] from a fruit, a precious statue in tattered rags, a cakravartin in the belly of a destitute woman, and a golden statue in clay."},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"918 Appendix 2[In due order, the respective obscuring factors in these nine exam­ples correspond to the following mental obscurations.] The four that consist of the three latencies of desire, hatred, and ignorance, as well as the intense rising of all [three] are the factors to be relinquished through cultivating the mundane paths.

Likewise, there are not the slightest previously nonexis­tent qualities of purified phenomena to be added because the nature of this basic element is the true nature of the ultimate qualities (such as the pow­ers) being primordially present in a spontaneous manner and being insep­arable from it. The actual (or perfect) prajna of knowing the ultimate (the subject) directly sees and rests in meditative equipoise in this suchness— the dharmadhatu that is the actual reality free from the two extremes (the object). This results in supreme familiarity with it and, through the gradual arising of the wisdom of directly seeing the actual reality of the nature of phenomena just as it is, one will attain the liberation from the adventitious stains to be relinquished. On the path of seeing, one is liberated from the stains to be relinquished through seeing; on the path of familiarization, from those to be relinquished through familiarization; and on the final path of nonlearning, from the entirety of the two obscurations including their latent tendencies.2833Yeshe DorjeYeshe Dorje s commentary on the Uttaratantra explains 1.154 as the teach­ing on the actual way of being of the basic element by identifying its essence:"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 921In general, among all phenomena, there is no entity whatsoever that withstands analysis. Therefore, just like illusions and dreams, they are without any nature. Consequently, there is not the slightest established phenomenon to be removed or to be added in any phenomena of samsara and nirvana. As the Bodhicaryavatara says:When phenomena are empty in this way,What is there to gain and what to lose?2834In particular, there is no characteristic of afflicted phenomena to be removed from the basic element that is completely pure by nature be­cause being naturally free from adventitious stains is its nature. Nor is there the slightest need for any characteristic of purified phenomena to be newly added (that is, to be set up) because the inseparable attri­butes are its nature. To see this actual reality as it really is, that is, in an unmistaken manner, is the path. Based on that, through directly seeing this actual reality (the object to familiarize with), the fruition is to be liberated temporarily from the factors to be relinquished through see­ing and ultimately from all stains without exception.2835Uttaratantra 1.155 is said to determine the basic element as being free from extremes through eliminating disputes:It may be said, “Isn’t the basic element merely empty [in the sense] of being nothing whatsoever? How is it suitable as something in which there is nothing [to be removed and] to be added?” The basic element (the subject) is not such [an emptiness] because it is empty of the seem­ing adventitious stains, which have the characteristic of being separa­ble (that is, being suitable to be disconnected), but it is not empty of the attributes that are the unsurpassable qualities, which have the char­acteristic (that is, the nature) of being inseparable (that is, not being suitable to be disconnected). The Srimaladevtsutra says:The tathagata heart is empty of all cocoons of afflictions that are separable [from it] and [can] be realized as being divisible [from it]. It is not empty of the inconceivable buddha attributes that are inseparable [from it], [can]not be realized as being divisible [from it], and far surpass the sand grains in the river Ganga [in number].2836"},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"922 Appendix 2One should analyze through ones own ability2837 how this applies to eliminating disputes. This teaches the defining characteristic of emp­tiness in an unmistaken way since it teaches what its manner of being free from the extremes of superimposition and denial is like. As the commentary says:Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist some­where, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accordance with actual reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real existent.2838The Bodhisattvabhumi states:Some sramanas or Brahmans neither assert that of which some­thing is empty nor do they assert what is empty of what. Such is called “a bad grasp of emptiness.” For what reason? Emptiness is reasonable by virtue of that which is empty being really existent and by virtue of that of which it is empty not being really exis­tent. By virtue of everything’s being nonexistent, where would what be empty of what? Therefore, the emptiness [in the sense] of such [nonexistence] is not reasonable. Hence, such represents a bad grasp of emptiness. So how is emptiness grasped well? Since one sees that something’s not existing somewhere [means that] the latter is empty of the former, one understands, in ac­cordance with true reality, that what remains there really exists there. This is called “engaging emptiness unmistakenly as it ac­cords with true reality.”2839This kind of realization of the mode of being of the profound na­ture of phenomena is called “the wisdom of the tathagata heart” or “the wisdom of emptiness.” Without it, the expanse cannot be real­ized, and those who are distracted to [anything] outside of it are those whose minds are distracted from emptiness. Therefore, the tathagata heart is not the object of those who have fallen into the views about a real personality because it is the heart of the dharmakaya.

Nor is it the object of those whose minds are distracted from emptiness because it is the heart of the pure dharmas. [The predicate] entails [the reason] because it has the nature of being empty of adventitious stains. This and so on is the meaning of the commentary.2840Gyaltsab Darma RinchenGyaltsab’s commentary on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 says that (1) the first verse represents the identification of the nature of the basic element, while (2) the second verse provides the proof for that.2841 (1) The explanation of the nature of the basic element is threefold: (a) the ground that is the basic nature of aU entities, (b) the view of realizing that, and (c) the fruition of having become familiar with that view.(la) Gyaltsab s actual glosses of 1.154 are quite similar to Rongton’s (see below), explaining that in this naturally pure basic element there are no pre­viously existing referent objects of the clinging to a personal and phenome­nal identity nor any afflictions established by a nature of their own that are to be newly removed because the referent objects of the twofold clinging to identity and afflictions established by a nature of their own never ex­isted in the first place. This indicates that no matter to which phenomenon one may cling as being really existent, this is a superimposition that strays from the actuality of the basic nature and that the referent objects of such clinging are not established in the first place. The clinging to the afflictions as being established by a nature of their own also is a form of clinging to an identity of phenomena, while this clinging to the afflictions being ex­plained separately from the clinging to an identity of phenomena entails an intention. Nor are there the slightest previously nonexistent two kinds of identitylessness to be added to this basic element because to be devoid of any personal and phenomenal identity is its nature. This indicates that the statement “The two kinds of identitylessness do not exist” is a form of de­nial in terms of wrongly engaging the actuality of the basic nature and that the negation of the referent objects of such wrong engagement is nothing to be newly added. To explain in general that the stains are not to be removed and that their remedies are not to be generated without specifying what is to be negated is a denial of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies.Also, I.154b is adduced for the sake of establishing what 1.154a ex­plains—when it is established that any assumed previously existing real establishment of the afflictions is not to be newly removed, it is established"},{"pageNumber":940,"pageContent":"924 Appendix 2that any previously nonexistent emptiness of a real existence of the afflic­tions is not to be newly added either. This is the explanation in terms of what is taught explicitly here.In terms of connecting this to its instances (mtshan gzhi)y in the per­son or the skandhas, there is nothing really established that is previously existent to be newly removed. Therefore, when the emptiness of real ex­istence—ultimate reality—is established, it is established that there is not the slightest previously nonexistent phenomenon empty of real existence, which is delusive and illusion-like, to be newly added either. Consequently, this also represents the establishment of the seeming reality of all agents and their objects being tenable within the actuality of their being empty of being established by a nature of their own.In brief, I.154ab teaches the union of the two realities, for which it suf­fices to accept in ones own system (a) the ultimate reality that is the emp­tiness of real existence in that there is not the slightest object to which the clinging to real existence could be directed and (b) the seeming reality that consists of all the presentations of agents and their objects.(lb) As for the view of realizing this union of the two realities, the pra- jrià that realizes the lack of nature and sees actual reality—the emptiness of a person and the skandhas being established by a nature of their own—as it really is the view of fully realizing the actuality of the basic nature.(lc) As for the fruition of having become familiar with that view, if one has embraced it with the vast means that represent the aspect of mahàyàna conduct, thus having seen actual reality directly, and then familiarizes one­self with it again and again, one will attain liberation—the state of com­pletely perfect buddhahood.(2) Uttaratantra 1.155 provides the proof for this. In this basic element there are no previously existing afflictions established by a nature of their own that are to be removed because the basic element is empty of adventi­tious stains established by a nature of their own, which have the character­istic of being separable and divisible from it by virtue of having cultivated their remedies. That is, the basic element is empty of these afflictions in the first place. This teaches the basic nature of both realities—the afflictions’ being divisible from the basic element through familiarizing with their remedies and any afflictions established by a nature of their own never hav­ing existed in the first place. Nor is there any previously nonexistent emp­tiness of afflictions established by a nature of their own to be newly added because what exists primordially is the basic elements not being empty of the emptiness of afflictions established by a nature of their own, with this"},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 925emptiness being the focal object due to which it is suitable for the unsur­passable buddhadharmas such as the powers, which have the characteristic of being inseparable from it, to arise. This teaches that the cause for the arising of the buddhadharmas—ultimate reality, which is the focal object of the prajha of directly realizing identitylessness—exists primordially.Thus, these two verses teach the ground (ultimate and seeming reality), the path (the prajha of directly realizing identitylessness), and the fruition (being able to attain completely perfect buddhahood). To assert that the seeming, such as a vases being empty of a vase, is self-empty and that ul­timate reality is a really existent ultimate that is other-empty means to be outside of what Maitreya holds and represents the extremes of denial and superimposition, respectively.In further commenting on R G W on 1.154-155, Gyaltsab says that in this naturally pure basic element of the tathagatas, there are no previously exist­ing characteristics or focal objects of afflicted phenomena and the clinging to a personal and phenomenal identity that are to be newly removed because it is the nature of this basic element to be free from adventitious stains that are established by a nature of their own. This indicates that being empty of being established by a nature of its own, being empty of being estab­lished through its own specific characteristics, and being empty of being established by its own essence are ultimate reality. One should understand that this teaches the presentation of the two realities as being equivalent to Nagarjunas position. Nor is there the slightest previously nonexistent char­acteristic of purified phenomena (identitylessness as the focal object of the prajha of directly realizing identitylessness) to be newly added to this basic element because the emptiness of a nature—the true nature of the pure phe­nomena that are inseparable from it through anything (such as remedies)— is the nature of this basic element. Thus, one clearly sees through the prajha of directly realizing identitylessness that when some phenomenon estab­lished by a nature of its own does not exist in some basis, the latter is empty of the former. During the phase of subsequent attainment, in accordance with true reality, one understands that what remains there—being empty of a nature of its own—always exists there.Rongton Sheja GiinsiRongtons commentary on the Uttaratantra explains 1.154-55 together as presenting the defining characteristics of the basic element that is to be real­ized.2842 He takes the adventitious stains to be nothing but the mistaken no­tions about the two kinds of identity in terms of persons and phenomena,"},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"926 Appendix 2while the unsurpassable dharmas are nothing but the pure nature of phe­nomena that consists of the two kinds of identitylessness.Beginning by referring to Ngog Lotsawas explanation, Rongton says that in this basic element, there are no previously existing two kinds of identity, the focal objects of the stains, to be removed because it is primor­dially empty of these two kinds of identity, the focal objects of the adven­titious stains, that have the characteristic of being separable from it. This teaches that the basic element is free from superimposition. In this basic element, there are also not the slightest two kinds of identitylessness, the focal objects of purified phenomena, to be newly added because it is not empty of these two kinds of identitylessness, the focal objects of the unsur­passable dharmas, that have the characteristic of being inseparable from it. This teaches that the basic element is free from denial.Having stated the characteristics of the basic element free from super­imposition and denial in this way, its perceiving subject—the viewing of actual reality—is taught. That is, actual reality (the two kinds of identity­lessness) should be viewed as it really is. Through viewing it in this way, if the actual reality that is personal identitylessness is seen, one is liberated from the afflictive obscurations, and if the actual reality that is phenomenal identitylessness is seen, one is liberated from the cognitive obscurations.2843Rongton declares that the word “characteristic” in “the characteristics of afflicted phenomena and purified phenomena” in RGVV here refers to “focal object” because RGVV explains the following on the jewel of the dharma:[However,] this [afflictiveness] should be seen in the same manner as a thorough investigator does who does not see any characteristics or focal objects of this [afflictiveness]. When neither characteristics not focal objects are seen, true reality is seen. Thus, these phenomena are completely and perfecdy realized by the Tathagata as being equal by virtue of their equality. In this way, [the Tathagata] does not see char­acteristics and focal objects, which are nonexistent, and sees ultimate reality, which is existent, in just the way it is in true reality. By virtue of [this seeing and nonseeing, the Tathagata] completely and perfectly re­alizes the equality of all phenomena through the wisdom of equality, in which neither of these two [nonexistent characteristics and the existent ultimate reality] is to be removed or to be added.2844"},{"pageNumber":943,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 927In other words, in this basic element, there are no characteristics of af­flicted phenomena—the stains—that exist by a nature of their own to be removed because adventitious stains are empty of any existence by a nature of their own. These stains are separable from the sugata heart because they have the characteristic of being divisible from it. Nor are there the slightest characteristics of purified phenomena—the factor of its natural purity—to be newly added to the basic element because it is not empty of the natu­ral purity that consists of the unsurpassable dharmas. For these have the characteristic of being inseparable from the naturally pure basic element. R G W says:because the pure nature of phenomena is its nature.2845The unsurpassable dharmas are the naturally pure nature of phenom ­ena, such as the powers, because the intention here is that this nature of phenomena exists in all sentient beings in a pervasive manner. As the Ut­taratantra says:Since it has the true nature of completely perfect buddhahood,The basic element of sentient beings is like a treasure.2846And:Awakening takes hold of sentient beings.2847The naturally pure nature of phenomena is referred to as “unsurpassable dharmas” because the qualities such as the powers arise through having familiarized with the true nature of phenomena by focusing on it. The reason for the basic elements not being empty of the unsurpassable qualities is “because the pure nature of phenomena is its nature.”Go LotsawaLike Jnana£rimitra and the Eighth Karmapa (see below), Go Lotsawa’s com­mentary on the Uttaratantra also comments on both Abhisamayalamkara V.21 and Uttaratantra 1.154, taking them to have different meanings in their respective contexts. According to Go Lotsawa,2848 Uttaratantra 1.153 indicates that the tathagata heart is not realized merely through devotion, while 1.154 teaches that it is realized through prajna alone. The comments on 1.154 begin with a question: “It is explained that since naive beings"},{"pageNumber":944,"pageContent":"928 Appendix 2superimpose a self onto the tathagata heart and sravakas superimpose phe­nomena onto it, they do not see it. Therefore, this states implicitly that the tathagata heart is seen through viewing persons and phenomena as identi- tyless. Still, it is taught that even if one wishes to view emptiness, through the mind being’s distracted elsewhere from emptiness, one does not real­ize the tathagata heart. Hence, if the tathagata heart is described through the principle or the word ‘emptiness,’ what is this tathagata heart that rep­resents emptiness?” The answer is given in 1.154-55:There is nothing to be removed from this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.The basic element is empty of what is adventitious,Which has the characteristic of being separable.It is not empty of the unsurpassable dharmas,Which have the characteristic of being inseparable.Since the first verse is in common with the Abhisamaydlamkdra, one should first understand the manner in which master Haribhadra’s Abhisamaydlamkaralokd2849 and Abhisamayalamkdravivrti2850 explain it in the context of the second wheel of dharma:Since it is not tenable to become liberated from clinging to [real] enti­ties [otherwise], without removing or adding anything from any phe­nomenon through what has the nature of denial or superimposition, the very nature of dependently originated form and so on that actually exists on [the level of] the seeming should be examined as [ultimately] having the nature that is the lack of nature and so on. Thus, just as an illusory elephant’s defeating another illusory elephant, if true reality is seen through putting an end to mistakenness, one will be liberated.The verse in the Abhisamaydlamkdra that immediately precedes V.21 says:That phenomena exist and, at the same time,The cognitive obscurations of the teacher Are terminated—this claim by others I consider as amazing."},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 929This states that if an actual nature of entities did exist, it would not be tenable for the buddha to be liberated from the cognitive obscurations. With this in mind, Haribhadra formulates the reason “Since it is not tenable to become liberated from clinging to [real] entities [otherwise]” at the beginning of his above explanation, which comments on the words “from this” in V.21.2851 So through what is one liberated then? One is liberated through seeing that phenomena lack a nature of their own. However, V.21 and its comments teach that this viewing of phenomena as lacking a nature of their own does not eliminate the seeming reality of phenomena nor does it add the ultimate. “Any phenomenon” in Haribhadra’s comments refers to any phenomena such as form or consciousness being suitable to be taken as the bearers of the nature of phenomena. When one looks at these bearers of the nature of phenomena as being phenomena that lack a nature of their own, one should look in a straightforward manner, without removing their mere existence through statements that have the nature of denial (saying that phenomena do not even exist seemingly or conventionally) or adding anything that does not exist through statements that have the nature of superimposition (saying that phenomena exist ultimately). The bearers of the nature of phenomena, such as form, are not eliminated by saying that they do not exist at all— their actual existence on the level of what seems to be is said to be seeming reality because their causal arising in the manner of dependent origination is established through valid cognition. Though the bearers of the nature of phenomena are not apprehended as possessing certain distinct features, what is apprehended as these bearers is what represents seeming reality. Therefore, Haribhadra comments on “actual reality” in V.21c as being “the very nature that actually exists on [the level of] the seeming.”The phrase “should be examined as [ultimately] having the nature that is the lack of nature and so on” comments on “is to be seen as it really is” in V.21c. As for “the nature that is the lack of nature,” since the lack of nature is not fabricated, it is said to be the essence, the nature, the ultimate, and the actual reality. Thus, the predicate to be proven is “the lack of nature.” The phrase “should be examined” is a synonym for “is to be seen,” which means to be seen through inferential valid cognition. “Thus,” with what is dependency arisens lacking a nature, both the factors to be relinquished (clinging to real entities) and their remedy (wisdom) are the seeming. Con­sequently, since both the factors to be relinquished and their remedy do not actually exist, “just as an illusory elephants defeating another illusory elephant,” through the elephant of seeing true reality putting an end to the elephant of mistakenness, one will attain liberation. Though it is stated"},{"pageNumber":946,"pageContent":"930 Appendix 2here that seeing the ultimate is the cause of liberation, it is not said that one is liberated merely through seeing the ultimate and that there is no need for becoming fully familiar with it.As for the manner in which this verse is understood in the context of the final wheel of dharma, “from this” (Skt. atah> Tib. ydi las) means “because of this”—because of this natural purity of the basic element, it is referred to as “emptiness.” It is referred to as “empty” because there is no characteristic of afflicted phenomena that serves as their nature and is to be removed. It is referred to as “-ness” because there are not the slightest qualities that are nonexistent and to be produced or newly added—the basic element pri- mordially has the nature of these qualities. Therefore, the nature of the basic element is empty of the adventitious stains, which have the charac­teristic of being suitable to be relinquished through separating them from the basic element. However, the basic element is not empty of the subtle elements that are the unsurpassable dharmas such as the powers, which have the characteristic of being inseparable from it and being unfabricated. This is what “-ness” means.W hen the Madhyamikas say that all entities are emptiness, there are two ways in which this is to be understood. To understand it as entities’ being emptiness without there being anything that is not emptiness is an exclu­sion of possession by others. To understand it as entities’ being empty of a nature of their own but existing as mere entities is an exclusion of non­possession and therefore an implicative negation.2852 W hen the inferential valid cognition of realizing that a vase lacks a nature of its own arises, what is assessed explicitly is a nonimplicative negation but what this also makes understood implicitly is that this vase is an entity empty of real existence. Therefore, there is no need to search for a second valid cognition to realize that it is like an illusion. In the final wheel of dharma, when examining the nature of adventitious attachment and so on, one does not see any nature of an object to be attached to or its subject—attachment itself. However, the basic ground of attachment is present as sheer naturally pure aware­ness, and its being present in this way means that its qualities (such as the supernatural knowledges) appear without deliberation too. As Uttaratantra I.94ab says:Therefore, without attaining buddhahood,Nirvana is not attained."},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 931It should be understood that this reasoning that is explained as pertaining to the phase of the fruition is also to be adduced during the phase of the path.As for “actual reality is to be seen as it really is,” “actual reality” is the emptiness that is the single mode of being, and “to be seen as it really is” refers to seeing and familiarizing with it on the ten bhumis as it really is. As for “whoever sees actual reality is liberated,” by virtue of the cause that con­sists of the cognitions of seeing actual reality up through the tenth bhumi, the consummate liberation of buddhahood will be attained.This is followed by Go Lotsawa’s quoting R G W ’s entire comments on1.154-55,2853 on which he then elaborates as follows. 1.155 teaches the m ean­ing of 1.154 in summarized form. Because the basic element is naturally pure,2854 it is the subject in question. That there is no cause2855 of afflicted phenomena to be removed from it is the predicate. Since it is explained in the context of teaching this basic element through the nine examples that the tathagata heart is delivered from the cocoons of its stains, one may as­sume that one needs to remove some stains that have a nature of their own, but such a concern is put to rest here. That the tathagata heart is to be de­livered by removing its stains is merely how things seem to be. Ultimately, the (false) imagination that is the cause that produces afflicted phenomena is not something to be removed because it is completely pure in terms of its own nature. For the reason that entails the above predicate is that, by its own nature, the basic element is free from adventitious stains—whatever is a nature of its own is unfabricated and therefore is not adventitious, just as the appearance of clouds in the sky does not change in the slightest any part of the sky into anything else. The outcome of this explanation is that since the stains of (false) imagination lack a nature, they can be removed—if they had a nature, they could not be removed, just like the tathagata heart.Also, to this2856 basic element (the subject) there is not the slightest cause of purified phenomena to be added (predicate) because the true nature of the inseparable pure dharmas is its nature (reason). Purified phenomena consist of cessation and the path, and their cause consists of proper mental engagement. When having familiarized with this mental engagement, the unsurpassable qualities are not to be added as something previously non­existent that is newly observed. Since these qualities and the basic element are primordially inseparable, proper mental engagement simply means to focus on the basic element just as it is. Since it is the true nature of the basic element to be primordially pure of stains, this is its unfabricated nature. One should understand that this teaches that there is no need for two sepa­rate kinds of familiarization—familiarizing with the basic element s natural"},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"932 Appendix 2lack of stains as well as familiarizing with its being the cause for the arising of qualities.In other words, in terms of the nature of the mind, there is no need to remove flaws or to newly add qualities. Therefore, the tathagata heart is empty of the cocoons of the stains, which possess the two features of being separable and being known to be divisible from it, since they do not touch its nature. But it is not empty of the inconceivable buddhadharmas that far surpass the sand grains in the river Gariga in number, which have the two features of being inseparable from the basic element (having the same nature) and not being known to be divisible from it. Therefore, this is called “-ness.” You may wonder, “But if these qualities are said to surpass the number of sand grains in the Gariga, do they have the same nature or a different one?” They are definitely of the same nature—the ten powers are only presented as ten by virtue of being divided in terms of their objects, but they are not ten different qualities by virtue of their own nature (the same goes for the other qualities). Therefore, in terms of the dharmakaya, though the aspects of infinite knowable objects are distinct and not mixed, said qualities are of the same nature. Hence, they are free from the flaw of being many. This nature is free from all reference points, and thus they can­not be characterized by any characteristics whatsoever. Hence, they are also free from being one. Thus, “inconceivable” means that their own nature cannot be demonstrated. Still, their “surpassing the number of sand grains in the Gariga” indicates that, in terms of enumeration, they are different. This is the meaning stated in 1.155.Thus, no matter in which teachings of the Buddha the word “emptiness” is mentioned, the meaning of all these cases is as follows. One clearly sees through valid cognition that when some phenomenon to be negated does not exist in some basis of negation, this basis is empty of that phenome­non. At that point it is said that what has been negated does not exist in this basis. In accordance with true reality, one understands through this single valid cognition that the remainder (both this basis and its attributes) of what has been negated there always (that is, definitely) exists in this basis.This means that no matter what kind of negating reason it may be, there is none whatsoever that does not implicitly indicate an affirmed phenom­enon. If it were possible not to indicate such an affirmed phenomenon, it would be possible that there are persons who, after having rejected merely what is to be rejected, do not wish for anything to be adopted instead. In that case, one would not see any persons anywhere who do not accomplish all their desired objectives. Here, if one realizes the tathagata heart to be"},{"pageNumber":949,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 933pure of adventitious stains, one will definitely and in any case direct one’s mind toward its qualities, just as when one hears that the blurred vision of ones old father has been cured and thus immediately understands that he can see forms clearly now.If emptiness is realized in an unmistaken manner, this will also dem on­strate the qualities of implicitly having put an end to the three kinds of obscurations (such as the views about a real personality) that obscure the tathagata heart. Here, R G W first teaches the general negation of the ex­tremes of superimposition and denial, saying that the two verses 1.154-55 elucidate the unmistaken defining characteristic of emptiness since it thus is free from the extremes of superimposition and denial. The explanation of the meaning of “empty” eliminates the aspect of superimposition within being mistaken about emptiness, and the meaning of “-ness” eliminates the extreme of denial within being mistaken about emptiness. Therefore, “unmistaken” also refers to the defining characteristics that make one un­derstand of which features emptiness is empty.This twofold mode of being of the distinctive features of emptiness— being empty of adventitious stains and not being empty of qualities—is the true actuality of emptiness. Those bodhisattvas whose minds stray from this understanding of emptiness and who mentally engage in many ways in what is not it (regarding it as a kind of extinction or as being the same as, or different from, form and so on) are said to be distracted from it. During the phase of the view, those who hold such wrong views about emptiness do not rest in meditative equipoise in this true actuality and thus do not attain superior insight, nor will they attain one-pointed calm abiding. Therefore, it is said that their minds are distracted from emptiness during the phases of both view and meditation. If one understands the emptiness explained here, one will neither think that the extinction of desire is emptiness, nor that this very desire is emptiness, nor that emptiness exists somewhere else than in that desire. Therefore, through resting free from negation and af­firmation right within however this very desire may appear, one will see its natural luminosity through superior insight. At the same time, no matter which thoughts may arise, they function as aids for samadhi, and thus this resting will also be one-pointed.Here, it is ultimate emptiness that is explained as emptiness, which is the tathagata heart that is also explained to be the ultimate reality that is called “the reality of the noble ones.” W ithout the samadhi during the level of engagement through aspiration that familiarizes with this tathagata heart, one is not able to realize the path of seeing the expanse that is without"},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"934 Appendix 2adventitious conceptions and, through the continuity of that, perceive it directly as the buddhabhümi. On the other hand, it is taught that one is not distracted toward anything else, if one realizes emptiness, just as it is, in the way described.With this perception of emptiness by the buddhas in mind, the Srïmàlàdevïsütra says that once the tathagata heart has become free from its stains, the wisdom of those who dwell on the buddhabhümi is also the tathâgatas wisdom of realizing emptiness. There is no need to search for any other wisdom of realizing emptiness that is not the tathagata heart. Having understood that the tathagata hearts being primordially empty of what is adventitious is the path, it is exactly by virtue of becoming familiar with this that the unsurpassable qualities that exist in this very tathagata heart unfold and thus become the wisdom of realizing emptiness.This tathagata heart is not seen directly by any srâvakas and pratyeka- buddhas, nor is it realized through any certainty that arises from famil­iarization because it is the extinction of afflictions that is seen as nirvana. W ithout there being any other means of realizing this tathagata heart, in­asmuch as it is the dharmakaya heart—the dharmakâyas being the wis­dom of liberation and therefore being the remedy for the views about a real personality—it is therefore said not to be the sphere of those who fall into the views about a real personality. For, though it is the dharmadhatu that gives rise to the view at first, its later purity is the remedy for all views. Inasmuch as the tathagata heart is the dharmakaya, the ultimate heart of all dharmas beyond the mundane seeming, it is said not to be the sphere of srâvakas and pratyekabuddhas, who delight in being mistaken about the dharmakaya in terms of its impermanence and so on. For the supramun- dane ultimate dharmakaya is endowed with qualities such as being per­manent and therefore is taught to be the remedy for mundane dharmas (the four kinds of mistakenness in terms of impermanence and so on). Inasmuch as the tathagata heart is the heart of the naturally pure qualities (such as the powers), it is therefore said not to be the sphere of the above two kinds of bodhisattvas whose minds are distracted from emptiness. For the meaning of the phrase “the dharmas that are the pure qualities of the tathagata heart, which are inseparable from the supramundane ultimate dharmakaya, are more powerfid2857 than other dharmas” is also the mean­ing of the phrase “they are empty because they have the nature of being empty of adventitious stains.”Having taught the meaning of Uttaratantra I.154ab and 1.155, there fol­lows the meaning of I.154cd:"},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 935Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.The gate that serves as the cause of the principle of empty and -ness— the wisdom that is not different from the dharmadhatu in that both are a singularity as the dharmakaya—is the level of engagement through aspiration. Having realized that, by virtue of the above three distinct features of the dharmakaya (its being the wisdom of liberation and therefore being the remedy for the views about a real personality, its being the ultimate heart of all dharmas beyond the mundane seeming, and its being the heart of the naturally pure qualities), the natural purity of the supramundane ultimate dharmakaya serves as the remedy for those who entertain views about a real personality, those who delight in being mistaken, and those whose minds are distracted from emptiness. Here, to see this natural purity is to see actual reality. It is said that the bodhisattvas who dwell on the ten bhumis do not behold the entire vast tathagata heart through that seeing, but they see it a little bit. To see it a little bit is asserted to be the seeing of actual reality, just as it is, through the vision of wisdom. This means that “actual reality” is the tathagata heart endowed with the above three distinct features. “Seeing” is asserted as the wisdom of seeing this tathagata heart a little bit on the ten bhumis. Having seen this actual reality, just as it is, on the first bhumi, this seeing increases further and further up through the tenth bhumi. For Dharmadhatustava 75-76 says:Just as when the waxing moon Is seen more in every moment,Those whove entered on the bhumis,See its increase step by step.On the fifteenth day of waxing,Eventually, the moon is full.Just so, when the bhumis end is reached,The dharmakaya s full and clear.What proves this, Go Lotsawa says, is the verse that concludes R G W s comments on 1.154-55:Just as the sun [seen] in the sky through a gap in the clouds [is not seen in its entirety], you are not seen in your entirety here"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"936 Appendix 2Even by the noble ones who have the pure eye of insight but whose insight is limited.Bhagavan, [only] those whose perceptiveness is infinite see your dharmakàyaIn its entirety, which pervades the infinite firmament of knowable objects.This means that, through the eye of the mind’s being washed by the samadhi of emptiness, the eye of the mind of the noble ones on the ten bhümis is pure of the stains of samsara. But even they, when looking at the sky of the dharmakàya of the Bhagavan have only limited and partial insight. They are similar to a person wishing to look at the vast sky and seeing only a little bit of the orb of the sun through a gap in the clouds that mostly obscure it. Thus, they do not see all aspects of the qualities of the dharmakàya, nor do they see the dharmakàya itself completely. Since the buddhas alone possess infinite perceptiveness, they always see that the dharmakàya pervades all beings and that the light of its qualities pervades the expanse of the firmament of the dharmadhâtu of infinite knowable objects.The meaning of “whoever sees actual reality” in I.154d is that the bud­dhas see actual reality fully, and “is liberated” refers to being free from all obscurations.It may be said, “But master Haribhadra says in his Abhisamayàlamkàrâ- lokà:Through having familiarized themselves with all phenomena’s being identityless, by virtue of the dharmadhâtu’s being without parts, bodhi­sattvas realize it in its entire nature. However, in terms of giving rise to [particular aspects of] certainty [about it], it is discriminated as the ac­tuality of omnipresence [on the first bhümi and so on]. Through this, a very lucid cognition of directly perceiving all phenomena to be without nature arises. At that time, bodhisattvas have correctly engaged what is flawless and therefore attain the path of seeing.2858Thus, he explains that when the path of seeing is attained, the dhar­madhâtu is realized in its entire nature because it does not have any parts. Here, however, it is explained that even those on the tenth bhümi see the dharmakàya only a little bit. Isn’t that very much contradictory?”Since Haribhadra explains the dharmadhâtu as phenomenal identityless- ness, which has the characteristic of a negative phenomenon (or negation), it"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 937is suitable to say that it is seen in its entirety on the path of seeing. However, the case here is different because the dharmakaya of the buddhas has the na­ture of a positive (or affirmative) phenomenon. Thus, these two explanations merely agree in that both use the name “dharmadhatu.” “That is true, but if it is explained here too that even bodhisattvas on the first bhumi see that the dharmadhatu, which is established as naturally luminous mind and pervades all sentient beings, how can it be said that bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi see it only a little bit?” Just as the dharmadhatu of bodhisattvas on the first bhumi is directly seen by them as their own tathagata heart, they see many instances of the dharmadhatu pervading others and also gain certainty that this is the case for all sentient beings. However, it is not that they see such directly with regard to all sentient beings because they do not see all sentient beings in a di­rect manner. For when the Dharantsvararajasutra explains the distinction be­tween appearing and nonappearing sentient beings, it asserts that those below the earth do not appear while those above do appear to bodhisattvas. Here, the meaning of “seeing a little bit” is that when bodhisattvas first see their tathagata heart, its qualities have not unfolded yet. Therefore, they only see these qualities as being small, but they see them increase further on the higher bhumis. However, compared to those of a buddha, even in bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi, the qualities of the tathagata heart are small.Diimo Dashi OserDashi Oser first presents a number of divergent ways that Tibetans identify the nature of the tathagata heart. According to the Gelugpas, the tathagata heart is the emptiness of minds being empty of real existence, which is a non- implicative negation. The Sakyapas assert that the tathagata heart is minds union of being lucid and empty. The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, says:Just this ordinary mindIs called “dharmadhatu” and “heart of the victors.”Neither is it to be improved by the noble ones Nor made worse by sentient beings.Without doubt, it may be expressed through many conventional terms, But its actual reality is not understood through expressions.2859In his actual comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55, Dashi Oser closely follows R G W and the Srimaladevisutra, saying that there are no afflicted phenomena to be removed from this tathagata element that is completely pure by nature because it is its nature to be free from adventitious stains."},{"pageNumber":954,"pageContent":"938 Appendix 2Nor is even the slightest purified phenomenon to be added to it because the inseparable and inconceivable buddha attributes are its true nature and essence. This tathagata heart is empty of all cocoons of the afflictions that are separable and can be realized as being divisible from it, whereas it is not empty of the inconceivable buddha attributes that are inseparable, cannot be realized as being divisible from it, and surpass the sand grains in the river Ganga in number.The Eighth Karmapa, Mikyo DorjeThe Eighth Karmapas Lamp does not explicitly comment on Uttaratantra1.154-55, but the following passage includes all the elements of the first verse:In this system, the ultimate is the object that is seen by the tathagatas— what truly exists, just as it is. The completely pure seeing of the tathaga­tas is the realization of the wisdom of equality that there is nothing to be removed, since, in its nature, ultimate reality is not tainted by obscuring stains, and that there is no wisdom that is other [than] this very [ultimate reality] to be added to it.

The phrase “the ultimate is the object that is seen by the tathagatas—what truly exists, just as it is” corresponds to line 1.154c. The phrases “the completely pure seeing of the tathagatas” and “having become lastingly free from the adventitious stains” correspond to line I.154d.A later passage in the Lamp combines the contents of 1.155-56 and 1.160 as well as RGVVs passage “Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accor­dance with actual reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real existent”:After it was mainly explained [in the second turning of the wheel of dharma] that all phenomena of seeming [reality] are empty (just as illusions, dreams, and clouds), it is taught [here] that the remainder— the tathagata heart, which is not empty of the heart of the unsurpass­able dharmas—exists.2861"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 939For the discussion of Uttaratantra 1.154 in the Eighth Karmapa’s com­mentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra, see appendix 3.Lochen DharmaàrïLochen Dharmašri relates Uttaratantra 1.154 to the three natures, saying that there are two models in the Madhyamaka systems that assert Shentong due to the difference of asserting that all knowable objects are contained in the three natures versus condensing them into the imaginary nature and the perfect nature.2862 In Yogàcàra texts, the basis of emptiness is the de­pendent nature, the object of negation is the imaginary nature, and the de­pendent natures being empty of the imaginary nature is the perfect nature. In texts such as the Uttaratantra, suchness—the perfect nature—is empty of the imaginary nature. Therefore, in the essence of the perfect nature— the ultimate expanse and the suchness of mind—there are no afflictions to be removed nor any previously nonexistent qualities to be newly added because it is primordially pure by nature and possesses qualities that are spontaneously present.Kongtrul Lodrô TayéJamgôn Kongtruls commentary on the Uttaratantra explains 1.154 as teaching the essence of emptiness and 1.155 as describing the manner of being empty and not being empty.2863In the basic element that is completely pure by nature, the sugata heart, there are no previously existent stains that are established as the nature of this basic element (the flaws of afflicted phenomena) to be removed because it is the nature of this [basic element] to be primordially free from all adventitious stains. Likewise, there are not the slightest previ­ously nonexistent qualities of purified phenomena to be added because the nature of this [basic element] is its true nature of the ultimate qual­ities (such as the powers) being spontaneously present [in it] and being inseparable [from it] since the very beginning. Thus, the perfect prajñá of knowing the ultimate (the subject) directly views and rests in med­itative equipoise in the actually real dharmadhâtu free from the two extremes (the object), due to which there is consummate familiarity [with this dharmadhâtu]. Also, through the gradual arising of the wis­dom of directly seeing the actuality of the pure nature of phenomena, just as it is, liberation from the adventitious stains to be relinquished is attained. On the path of seeing, one will be liberated from the stains to"},{"pageNumber":956,"pageContent":"940 Appendix 2be relinquished through seeing. On the path of familiarization, one will be liberated from the stains to be relinquished through familiarization.On the final path, one will be liberated from the entirety of the two obscurations including their latent tendencies.Mind’s basic nature free from anything to be removed or added is free from extremes. Since the basic element is empty of the adventitious stains that have the characteristic of being separable, that is, divisible, from this basic element, it is free from the extreme of superimposing [undue] existence [onto it]. Since that basic element is not empty of the attributes that are the unsurpassable qualities (such as the powers) and have the characteristic of not being divisible from the basic ele­ment through being separable [from it], it is free from the extreme of denying it [by saying that] it does not exist. It is also liberated from the extreme of being both existent and nonexistent because [existence and nonexistence] are mutually exclusive. Precisely because of that, it is lib­erated from the extreme of being neither (the negation of the [third extreme]) too. Therefore, this alone is the principle of unmistaken emptiness liberated from the two extremes or the four possibilities.For the same author’s TOK that quotes and explains these two verses in the context of the view and meditation of sütra Mahâmudrâ,2864 see the introduction. Elsewhere, TOK also briefly explains the contents of these verses without directly referring to them:It is taught that this heart is empty of all adventitious flaws or stains. [However,] it is not empty of the attributes of unsurpassable qualities, but possesses them in a spontaneously present way. Therefore, with regard to its essence, there are no stains to be removed and no qualities to be added. This is not realized through mère one-sided study and reflection, but it is gradually realized through the stainless personally experienced or self-arisen awareness that comes from meditation.2865The same author’s Guiding Instructions on the View o f Great Shentong M adhyam aka describes the essential parts of the main practice of distin­guishing well existence, nonexistence, and so on, in accordance with the third turning of the wheel of dharma and the vajrayâna, once any suit­able samâdhi of calm abiding and superior insight has arisen, as follows.2866 The tathagata heart (the basis of distinctive features) that is endowed with the many qualities of freedom of a buddha (the distinctive features) is at"},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"Comments on Uttaratantra 1.154-55 941present the self-aware wisdom that is lucid and unceasing, is the innate nat­ural state, and is experienced through study, reflection, and meditation. Ex­actly this is what abides as the basis of purification. After the adventitious stains (what is to be purified) have become pure, nothing but this basic nature that abides in oneself (the result of purification) becomes manifest, which is labeled as “the dharmakaya free from stains.” Though it arises as all aspects of samsara and nirvana, from the very moment of their arising, these aspects do not move away from that ground, just as all kinds of re­flections may appear in a stainless crystal ball, but from the very moment of their appearing do not mix with that crystal. In the same way, no matter how the appearances of samsara, nirvana, and the path may appear within this lucid and empty self-awareness that is stripped bare, they are self-aris­ing and self-liberating, without ever tainting the essence of this awareness. Therefore, without there being any latent tendencies of views and flaws to be removed and without there being any need to newly add any distinctive qualities that did not exist before, the wisdom of the noble ones rests in meditative equipoise in emptiness. In order to bring this clearly to mind, the text has one recite and contemplate Uttaratantra 1.154.Likewise, out of ones trust in the ground that is suitable to be freed from the stains and is suitable for the qualities to arise, one contemplates Uttaratantra 1.155 as follows. Everything that is separable, such as karma, causes and results, karmic maturations, afflictions, skandhas, dhatus, ayata- nas, and dependent origination, has not only never existed ultimately, but even on the level of seeming reality, the tathagata heart is merely associated with all these phenomena but is never tainted by any of them. By contrast, the inseparable buddha attributes that outnumber the sand grains in the Ganga, such as the self-arisen major and minor marks, the powers, the fear­lessnesses, the threefold foundation of mindfulness, great love and com­passion, and immeasurable samadhis (such as the vajra-like samadhi) and wisdoms (such as dharmadhatu wisdom), are present in an intrinsic and primordial manner. Therefore, the tathagata heart is not empty of them.Furthermore, lines 91-94 in the Third Karmapa s Pointing O ut the Tathagata Heart are literally Uttaratantra 1.154, on which Kongtrul Lodro Taye s commentary says the following:In this mind as such, the sugata heart, there are no separate stains to be removed that are established as any real entities other than [just] our being fettered through our own discriminating notions of mistaken appearances. Since [this sugata heart] is naturally endowed with its"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"942 Appendix 2qualities, there is not the slightest to be newly added or produced that did not exist before. Therefore, actual reality—mind as such free from something to be removed or added—is to be seen as it really is, that is, in the manner of its being unable to look at itself. Through looking in this way [of not looking], it is seen that mind as such—the inseparabil­ity of dhátu and wisdom—actually is [this inseparability]. Hence, the adventitious stains are [nothing but our] discriminating notions, and these lack any nature of their own, just like mirages. If this lack [of any nature] is actually seen for what it is, one is liberated from being fettered by these discriminating notions.2867M ipham RinpocheMipham Rinpoche’s commentary on the Uttaratantra explains that 1.154 identifies the emptiness that is to be realized.2868 In this naturally pure basic element, there are no previously existing flaws of afflictions to be removed and not the slightest fraction of qualities to be newly added. The ultimate prajñá that is the perceiving subject that accords with actual reality sees and rests in meditative equipoise in actual reality—the basic nature free from superimposition and denial in this way—as it really is. Upon this prajñá’s being utterly familiar with that, when actual reality is seen as it is, one is lib­erated from the two obscurations. W hat is the reason that the basic element is without anything to be removed or added? The basic element is empty of the adventitious stains, which have the characteristic of being separable (that is, divisible) from it in that they are different from the dharmadhátu s own nature, because its nature is primordially without stains. The basic ele­ment is not empty of the unsurpassable qualities such as the powers, which have the characteristic of being inseparable (that is, indivisible) from it by their very own nature. Since it is primordially endowed with them, they do not need to be newly added. Therefore, it is like the sun and its rays.The same authors Synopsis o f the Sugata Heart says that the tathagata heart is free from all reference points such as permanence and extinction and is the inseparability of the two realities, the single sphere (thig le nyag gcig), and equality.2869 Within this basic nature, all possible appearing phe­nomena are of one taste and are true reality. To see that as it is is the see­ing of the actual reality that is without anything to be removed or added. Therefore, to be free of all clinging is the excellent view of realizing the ultimate.2870"},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"Appendix 3: Indian and Tibetan Comments on Abhisamayalamkara V.21Indian CommentariesThere is nothing to be removed in this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.The earliest Indian commentators, Aryavimuktisena and Bhadanta Vi- muktisena (sixth/seventh century), as well as most of the shorter summarizing commentaries do not provide any explanations of this verse. In the other commentaries, the verse is usually presented in the context of how the path of seeing is concordant to its ultimate fruition—buddhahood.Haribhadras (eighth century) Abhisamaydlamkdrdlokd2871 and Abhi- samayalamkdravivrti2872 comment that since it is not tenable to become lib­erated from clinging to real entities in any other way, without removing or adding anything from any phenomenon through what has the nature of denial or superimposition, the very nature of dependently originated form and so on that actually exists on the level of the seeming should be examined as ultimately having the nature that is the lack of nature and so on. Thus, just as an illusory elephants defeating another illusory elephant, if true reality is seen through putting an end to mistakenness, one will be liberated. The Vivrti adds that after the position of (real) existence has been refuted, the position of the lack of nature is the sole one to be accepted by those who wish for liberation.Among the six subcommentaries on Haribhadra’s Vivrti, the Abhisa- maydlamkaravrittipinddrtha by Prajnakaramati (late tenth century) says that the sole function of the path of seeing is to put an end to any additions and removals with regard to form and so on by virtue of the emptiness of943"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"944 Appendix 3a nature of their own.2873 This characteristic of putting an end to all super­impositions due to all phenomena’s being without activity is the meaning of “great awakening.”According to the Durbhodaloka by the Yogacara master Dharmaklrtiirl (tenth/eleventh century) from Sumatra (a teacher of Atisa), Haribhadra’s phrase “the position of (real) existence’s having been refuted” teaches that all philosophical systems about the apprehended and so on are false philo­sophical systems.2874 Having stabilized and ascertained the position of the lack of nature (the philosophical system of all-pervasive identitylessness), this position of all entities being identityless is the sole one to be accepted by those who wish for liberation (perfect awakening) because it is the only reasonable one. As for “there is nothing to be removed in this,” since it is not tenable to become liberated while entertaining them, the views about true reality by Buddhist tirthikas that superimpose ultimate existence and so on are to be removed. As for “not the slightest to be added,” the super­impositions of a self and so on by non-Buddhist tirthikas are not to be added. This refers to the modes of the views about the seeming and the ultimate in terms of existence. The removal of views about nonexistence is expressed by the last two lines of V.21. “Actual reality” is actually real as, or by virtue of, dependent origination, that is, one should see and un­derstand form and so on just as they are according to common consensus. W hat happens through that is that “whoever sees actual reality is liberated.” That is, one becomes a buddha through familiarizing with their own na­ture, which represents the relinquishment of all afflictions including their latent tendencies.In other words, denial consists of thinking that it is not tenable to be­come liberated from clinging to (real) entities and that awakening is im­possible. Claims of any kind of ultimate existence and so on that invalidate identitylessness have the nature of superimpositions. These are removed if concerns about existing by nature are removed and one thus sees true reality by virtue of the valid cognitions of phenomena’s lacking the nature of either being single or multiple and so on. W hen one realizes this with­out damaging any phenomena through any notions of a self and so on either on the level of the seeming or the ultimate, one is delivered from the twelve links of dependent origination (ignorance and so on). Therefore, the nature of the skandhas of form and so on being dependently originated and actually existing on the level of the seeming conventionally is void and lacks a nature, thus having the nature of being like an illusion. This is what one should examine and familiarize with. W hat happens through that is"},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"Comments on Abhisamayalamkara V.21 945that “just as one illusory elephants defeating another illusory elephant,” the unreal mistakenness that arises from the afflictions, which in turn arise from the views about a self, is relinquished by the unreal path. W hen true reality is seen by virtue of that, the seeing of, and the confidence in, all-per­vasive identitylessness is liberation, which is the attainment of perfect wis­dom. Since according to our own position all phenomena are illusion-like, the illusions of afflictions and so on are put to an end through the illusion of the path. Therefore, in the true reality of entities, there are neither an­tagonistic factors nor remedies. As it is said:Non-nirvana and nirvanaTaught by the protector of the worldAre [like] knots made by spaceBeing untied by that very space.According to the Prajhapradipavail by Buddhasrljriana (twelfth/thirteenth century), by virtue of the nature of true reality, from the very start, there is no aspect of previously existing antagonistic factors to be removed in these phenomena that have the character of consisting of the path of seeing and so on, nor is there the slightest remedial factor that is to be newly added to them.2875 However, just as on the path of seeing and so on, the true end (bhutakoti), which has the characteristic of being of a single taste and is the actuality in which no negations or affirmations whatsoever are established, is seen by those with unmistaken insight in accordance with this actuality as it really is. Therefore, just as an illusory kings being defeated by another illusory king, through having put an end to mistakenness, when they finally see in the manner of not even seeing the true end, they will be liberated from all clinging. Thus, by virtue of the emptiness of arising and ceasing, they cognize the lack of a self. By virtue of external referents’ not being established, they cognize them as being mere mind. By virtue of the fact that there is no apprehender if there is nothing apprehended, they realize the nature of nonduality. By virtue of the fact that there is nothing to be observed in true reality, they practice the yoga of signlessness.2876 Through the power of that, they perceive all phenomena, which, just like space, have the characteristic of nonconceptuality and are to be personally experienced, just as they are. By virtue of that, they will attain the fruition of realizing the nature of termination and nonarising, which is primordially without arising and nonarising."},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"946 Appendix 3The Prasphutapada by Dharmamitra (eighth/ninth century) follows Haribhadra s comments but then relates V.21 to the notion of buddha na­ture.2877 According to this text, Haribhadra’s above phrase “the very nature of dependently originated form and so on actually existing on the level of the seeming” teaches that appearances are not removed. As it is said:Therefore, this is not in order to removeThe appearances of those who propound the lack of nature.One may wonder how such a variety of appearance will not fall into the extreme of being (real) entities. Haribhadra answers, “the very nature . . . should be examined as [actually] having the nature that is the lack of nature and so on.” This is taught in the sutras by the example of a vina—if there is no effort of plucking the strings of the vina and so on, there will be no sound, but one will not find any entity of sound even if one dismantles the body and so on of the vina—it simply ceases. Likewise, this very profound tathagata heart that does not fall into either samsara or nirvana is not just this very form and so on, but also their disappearance by being relinquished is simply a relinquishment by virtue of their being this sheer dhatu of peace. Therefore, one should understand that its nature simply cannot be expressed as being other than or being identical to them. Thus, Haribhadra says, “just as an illusory elephants defeating another illusory elephant, if true reality is seen through unmistakenness, one will be liberated.” This point is also stated by the Bhagavan Maitreya in his Mahdydnasutrdlamkara:Just as an illusory kings being defeated By another illusory king,The children of the victors who see All phenomena are without pride.2878The Kirtikala by Ratnaklrti (eleventh century), a student of Dharmakirtisri, seems to lean more toward a Yogacara explanation, saying that “in this” refers to the emptiness of apprehender and apprehended, which are imaginary by virtue of all phenomena’s, which have the character of simply being the continuum of nondual lucid mind, being (mistakenly) divided by way of isolates.2879 Therefore, there is nothing to be removed in this emptiness.

Actual reality is true reality, which has the character of emptiness. So how is this to be understood? To be seen means to be perceived by self- awareness, and as it really is means through valid cognition. Whoever sees actual reality will be liberated from the bondage of samsara.The Suddhamati by Ratnakara^anti (early eleventh century) says that since they have the characteristic of emptiness, the variety of phenomena is nothing but the nature of phenomena.2880 For that reason, there is noth­ing that represents antagonistic factors that are to be eliminated and re­moved. Nor is there the slightest that represents remedial factors that are to be added because they are without arising. So how is this to be understood? Actual reality is to be seen as it really is, that is, the variety of phenomena is to be seen in this way as being nothing but the dharmadhatu. Whoever sees in this way will also be liberated from the cognitive obscurations.According to the same authors Sarottamd, there is nothing to be re­moved because neither persons nor phenomena exist.2881 Nor is there the slightest to be added because personal and phenomenal identitylessness are without beginning and end. However, these two kinds of identitylessness are to be seen as actual reality as it really is because if the actual reality of personal identitylessness is seen, one is liberated from the afflictive obscu­rations, and, if the actual reality of phenomenal identitylessness is seen, one is liberated from the cognitive obscurations.The M arm akaum udi by Abhayakaragupta (eleventh/twelfth century) comments that there is not the slightest to be added because all phenomena do not exist by a nature of their own.2882 There is nothing to be removed be­cause this nature of theirs is without beginning and end. Actual reality, just as it is by virtue of this nature of theirs, is to be seen as it really is. Whoever sees actual reality will be liberated from afflictive and cognitive obscura­tions. Therefore, the seeing of unreal phenomena is the antagonistic factor. To see them as lacking a nature is the remedy. Thus, just as an illusory elephants being victorious over another illusory elephant, one is endowed with the seeing of true reality through having put an end to mistakenness.In addition, Maitrlpas Dohakosapahjikd quotes Abhisamayalamkara V.21 in the context of lines 82-83 of Sarahas Dohakosagiti (“The Peoples Doha”):The nature of connateness Is not an entity nor a nonentity."},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"948 Appendix 3Here, “entity” refers to the entities that appear to the eyes and so on as well as the entities that are conceived by the mind.

Thus, it is said:There is nothing to be removed from this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.2883Maitrlpas Caturmudranišcaya says that among the four mudrás, the dharmamudrá has the nature of the dharmadhatu—it is free from reference points, nonconceptual, uncontrived, free from arising, has the nature of compassion, and serves as the means that is beautified by supreme bliss.2884 By virtue of being permanent in terms of an unbroken continuity, it has the nature of connateness. By virtue of prajñá arising from connateness, it is not different from it. It is also the inseparability of emptiness and compassion. Through being skilled in this, the path is to be understood as the proximate cause that is the aspect of suchness. Due to having familiarized repeatedly with that path, one will directly perceive the cessation that has the nature of connateness. As Abhisamaydlamkara V.21 says:There is nothing to be removed from this And not the slightest to be added.Actual reality is to be seen as it really is—Whoever sees actual reality is liberated.The dharmamudra represents the cause of mahámudrá due to not being different from it.2885Tibetan CommentariesAmong the Tibetan commentaries on the Abhisamaydlamkdra, almost all of them agree that V.21 presents the Madhyamaka view, and they closely follow Haribhadra s above explanation of all phenomena’s being free from complete nonexistence (by virtue of dependent origination) and real exis­tence (by virtue of lacking any nature)."},{"pageNumber":965,"pageContent":"Comments on Abhisamayalamkara V.21 949In particular, Ngog Lotsawas commentary says that verses V. 18-21 dis­cuss the nature of the fruition of the path of seeing, with V.21 teaching that liberation is justified for those with the view of emptiness.2886M iphams (1846-1912) commentary elaborates on V.21 that in the true nature of entities, there are no previously existing two types of obscura­tions that are to be removed and no previously nonexisting qualities (such as being empty) that are to be newly added because the nature of entities, which cannot be produced, cannot be contrived through removal or addi­tion. Therefore, if one rests in meditative equipoise in the actual reality or nature free from superimposition and denial (equality without anything to be removed or added) by way of seeing it as it really is through a state of mind that accords with it in being free from denying and affirming, through the power of having familiarized with that, actual true reality—the basic nature of not abiding in any extreme whatsoever—is seen. Through this, ones mind stream is liberated from the bondage through conceptions about characteristics. This presents the ultimate essential point of the pro­found yoga of prajnaparamita. Thus, it is only in terms of the sheer way of how things appear that putting an end to the conceptions in ones mind stream that are mistaken about the nature of phenomena free from any­thing to be removed or added is called “relinquishing the factors to be relin­quished,” while the arising of a state of mind that accords with the nature of phenomena is referred to as “the arising of realization.” However, in the basic nature, neither relinquishment nor arising are established.2887Commenting on Haribhadras Abhisamayalamkdravivrti, the commen­tary on the Abhisamayalamkara by the Eighth Karmapa, Mikyo Dorje, starts by saying that V.21 ascertains the position of the “lack of nature,” which is the system of Madhyamaka, as the sole position to be accepted by those who wish for liberation.2888 Next, the Karmapa has someone ask why it is not tenable for the nondual wisdom whose nature is dependent origination to exist. If it existed in the manner of being established as an entity through a nature of its own, it is not tenable to become liberated from clinging to it as being such an entity. Therefore, not removing anything from phenom ­ena (mere appearances) by denying that they exist in accordance with de­pendent origination and not adding anything to them by superimposing that they exist as being established through a nature of their own, all these merely appearing phenomena have the conventional nature of existing on the level of seeming reality as correct common worldly consensus that only satisfies as long as it is unexamined. This is to be examined as having the actual nature of being without any nature, nonarising, primordial voidness,"},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"950 Appendix 3and so on. It may be argued that if all phenomena had the illusion-like na­ture of mere dependent origination empty of any nature, all presentations of factors to be relinquished and their remedies would be untenable. They are not untenable—just as an illusory elephant may defeat another illusory elephant, through producing dependently originating remedies that are empty of a nature of their own, dependently originating factors to be re­linquished that are empty of a nature of their own are put to an end. Once true reality is seen by virtue of that, one will be liberated from bondage.Furthermore, the Karmapa contrasts his own comments on V.21 with his comments on Uttaratantra 1.154 in terms of the notion of nondual wis­dom.2889 As for the former, he says that, in this dependent origination that is the basic nature of emptiness free from all reference points, the aspect of the ultimate (nonmistakenness) is not to be removed and not the slightest aspect of the seeming (mistakenness) is to be added. Therefore, through the prajñá of realizing phenomenal identitylessness in accordance with the actual way of being of objects, the basic nature of suchness (actual reality) is to be seen as it really is. Then, to actually see, realize, or penetrate the lack of any nature (such as some identity’s being established by a nature of its own) is what liberates from the clinging to phenomenal identity. As for the words “in this” in V.21 a, the Karmapa says that according to Áryavimuktisena and Haribhadra, in the context of Madhyamaka, there are two kinds of nondual wisdom—nominal and nonnominal. Through their putting forth the first one of these wisdoms as not being really established because it is of the nature of dependent origination, all phenomena are nothing but emptiness. There is a purpose for saying it like that because the reason that the appear­ing aspect of all phenomena is dependent origination is what ascertains the aspect of their actual way of being to be emptiness. To ascertain this also has an outcome. If one relies on the activity of purifying one’s mind stream through the reasonings in the context of studying and reflecting that explain in this way that all phenomena are empty of phenomenal identity, finally the power of meditation reaches perfection because this activity is the supreme means to manifest the path of seeing that phenomena are empty of identity.On Uttaratantra 1.154, the Karmapa comments that this verse identifies the emptiness beyond dependent origination, which is the nonnominal non­dual wisdom to be seen during the path of seeing. Here, the words “from this” in 1.154a identify the nonnominal nondual wisdom that is not suitable as a counterpart connected to the appearing aspect of the seeming or any phenomena that depend on it or are supported by it. As for the meaning of “there being nothing to be removed or added,” in the nature of this nondual"},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"Comments on Abhisamayalamkara V.21 951wisdom, no obscurations are to be removed and no wisdom is to be added. Rather, it is the object to be seen by personally experienced wisdom, but there is no chance ever of its being viewed by something else, that is, conscious­ness. Also, the nondual wisdom that is the object to be viewed is an entity. In sentient beings or adventitious stains (which are like darkness), the nondual all-accomplishing tathagata wisdom in its entirety (which is like light) exists primordially. Within each one of all kinds or realms of sentient beings, there is no being whatsoever into which this wisdom has not always entered in its entirety because this all-accomplishing wisdom, through entering all sen­tient beings, eliminates the adventitious stains (these very sentient beings), just as light eliminates darkness. That this wisdom is able to eliminate sen­tient beings in this way is said in terms of not analyzing it through reasoning. But if one analyzes through reasoning, sentient beings or adventitious stains are not eliminated by buddhahood or nondual wisdom because what is to be eliminated (sentient beings or adventitious consciousness) does not exist from the very beginning. Thus, it is already eliminated in the first place and need not to be eliminated again. Also, buddhahood or nondual wisdom does not enter beings again in order to eliminate stains because it has the nature of always having entered them as that which eliminates the stains right from the start. However, as for ordinary mistaken beings, due to not realizing that sentient beings (or adventitious stains) do not exist from the very start, they think that what existed before is eliminated later. Due to not realizing that any factors to be eliminated have already ceased through the power of how entities are (that is, the factors to be eliminated being phenomena that are unarisen), beings think that these factors have been put to an end through the power of remedies. Due to not realizing that nondual wisdom exists pri­mordially, beings think that this wisdom newly eliminated the adventitious stains through the power of its sudden arising.2890The commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkara by the Fifth Shamarpa, Goncho Yenla (1525-1583),2891 explains V.21 in terms of minds true na­ture—the stainless tathdgatagarbha with its natural qualities: “Since there are no stains in this [buddha] heart—the pure dependent [nature], the alaya-wisdom—there is nothing to be removed and since it is of begin- ningless time, not the slightest wisdom to be newly added. ‘But how does one familiarize with it then?’ One familiarizes in the manner of actual real­ity—ones own mind as such—seeing itself as it really is. At that point, with all dualistic clinging having vanished if actual reality, without the duality of what is looked at and what looks at it, is seen, the path of seeing is attained and one is liberated.”2892"},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"Appendix 4: The Emptiness Endowed with All Supreme AspectsIn the sutra system, the meaning of the term “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects”2893 is that genuine emptiness is not just some blank state of nothingness, but entails many supreme qualities. “All aspects” is usually explained as the six paramitas and further pure qualities that represent the means on the path and reach their “supreme” culmination on the level of buddhahood. As the Ratnacudapariprcchasutra describes this emptiness in detail:These [bodhisattvas] don the armor of great love and dwell in the bless­ing of great compassion, thus turning them into the samadhi of ac­complishing them in the form of the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects.

It is blessed by looking upon all sentient beings. It is exquisitely embellished by the full accomplishment of the buddhakäya, has the fully evolved buddha voice, and is endowed with the equality of buddha samädhi. It is endowed with the miraculous powers and the discriminating awarenesses of a buddha, is perfectly seized by the force of the ten powers, dwells in the four fearlessnesses, and accords with the eighteen unique buddha attributes. It is not mixed with the yänas of srävakas and pratyekabuddhas, has eliminated [all] afflictions connected with latent tendencies, is not separated from the wisdom of the supernatural knowledges, is the teacher of all sentient beings, has attained the four reliances, and has attained the equality of mundane and supramundane phenomena. It is without blame by virtue of maturing all sentient beings, guides them, is skilled, and eliminates the suffering of all sentient beings. It is [the state in which] all afflictions have been purified, has crossed the stream [of samsära], has severed all clinging, is utter natural peace, is the peace of all karma and afflic­tions, is equanimity by virtue of the nature of phenomena, and beholds all buddha attributes. It is inanimate through its own characteristics, is not released in order to grant blessings, is neutral on its own accord, always makes efforts in buddha activity, is composed by virtue of being utterly peaceful, and always blazes in order to mature sentient beings. This is called “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects.” . . .

In agreement with the Ratnacüdapariprcchäsütra, Kamalasllas second Bhavanäkrama emphasizes the need for cultivat­ing this emptiness in meditation, since—unlike a bare emptiness without compassion (the aspect of skill in means)—this is the only path that leads to buddhahood.2895 He says that one should make efforts in meditatively"},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"The Emptiness Endowed with All Supreme Aspects 955accomplishing the emptiness that has a heart of great compassion, that is, all the accumulations of merit (such as generosity) and wisdom. If that hap­pens, such a samadhi accomplishes the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects (this is followed by the above quote from the Ratnacudapari­prcchasutra). Therefore, bodhisattvas must rely on generosity and so on as the means to accomplish all excellent buddha qualities. Otherwise, of what would these qualities be the results? Hence, the omniscient wisdom that is endowed with all supreme aspects is perfected through the means such as generosity. In his third Bhavanakrama, KamalaSlla again refers to the Rat- nacudapariprcchasutray saying that one should familiarize with the emp­tiness endowed with all supreme aspects through being endowed with all virtues such as generosity, which thus does not refer to nothing but sheer emptiness.2896 He provides another quote from the Ratnakuta, stating that, just as a king who is supported by his ministers performs everything that is necessary, the prajna of bodhisattvas that is embraced or supported by skill in means performs all buddha activities. Therefore, the Buddha said that bodhisattvas will enter into the nirvana of arhats if they rely on nothing but emptiness.Sahajavajra’s commentary on Maitrlpas Tattvadasaka 6 uses the term “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects” in its explanation of the union of calm abiding and superior insight in Maitrlpas paramita-based M ahamudra approach:That [engaging bodhicitta] of the [paramita system alone], due to [its approach of] analysis [described above], is not completely pure. But here, [the engaging mind of bodhicitta] is to be cultivated through a nonanalytical mind right from the start. When the center of union is realized through the pith instructions of paramita that are adorned with the words of the guru, just this spontaneously and continuously engaging prajna of the ultimate—the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects—is calm abiding and nothing else.. . . Therefore, this kind of union of calm abiding and superior insight is the path. What is not intended here is an engaging mind [of bodhicitta] that aspires for a fruition different [from that union]. As it is said:What is called “the realization of emptiness”In the thousands of collections of the dharma,This realization is due to analysis.The [realization] of the guru lacks analysis."},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"956 Appendix 4In order to clarify these [quotes], [Maitrlpa] instructs, “Since true re­ality dawns ceaselessly for those who are aware of its ground.” The ground of this engaging mind [of bodhicitta] is what has the nature of the suchness of the union [of appearance and emptiness, or the two realities, or of calm abiding and superior insight]. For those who are aware of [this] through the pith instructions of the genuine guru, true reality—the inseparability of emptiness and compassion, which is the defining characteristic of the ultimate bodhicitta—dawns ceaselessly in each and every moment.2897In that vein, lines VI.24-27 of the Third Karmapa s Profound Inner Re­ality say:To do that, familiarize with day- and nighttime luminosity,Which is lucid yet nonconceptual.Enjoy mahâmudrâ—The emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects.Karma Trinlépas commentary on this explains:Here, my guru, the mighty victor [the Seventh Karmapa] holds the fol­lowing. Since the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects and the sugata heart are equivalent, “being endowed with all supreme aspects” refers to the sugata hearts being actually endowed with the sixty-four qualities of freedom and maturation, and the meaning of “emptiness” is that this is not established as anything identifiable or as any character­istics. Therefore, he asserts that making it a living experience—cultivat­ing this lucid yet nonconceptual [state]—is Mahâmudrâ meditation.2898The Third Karmapas commentary on verse 101 of Nàgàrjunas Dharma- dhâtustava explains “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects” as follows:The fundamental change in dependence on the stainless dharmakaya does not refer to having become nothing whatsoever. Rather, the oceans of the hordes of thoughts have come to rest in the sea of wis­dom, which is the final consummation of the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects.

Through “the supreme” of these [aspects, their] unsurpassable consummation [is expressed]. [These aspects are] “emp­tiness,” since they, in terms of their own essence, are nothing but purity itself and thus inseparable [from emptiness]. This is described in detail in the Uttaratantra through the example of the portrait [of a king].2899The same authors commentary on the Dharmadharmatávibhága says that Uttaratantra 1.154-55 “teaches the defining characteristics of the emp­tiness endowed with all supreme aspects, free from the extremes of super­imposition and denial.”2900The Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkara quotes a verse that he attributes to Mañjusrí2901 and explains it as follows:The emptiness of analyzing all aspects Is without a core, just like a banana tree.The emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects Will never be like that.When the nature of all imaginary and dependent phenomena (such as the skandhas) is analyzed, their own nature is emptiness, just as in the example of a banana tree without pith. As for the perfect nature (the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects), in general, it cannot be analyzed and no matter how it may be analyzed, it does not become like that—empty of a nature of its own. For it never changes into anything else than this supreme kind of wisdom [of the perfect nature].Pawo Rinpoches commentary on the Bodhicaryavatara also quotes this verse, saying that it comes from the tantras.2902 The emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects is the emptiness that is endowed with all the supreme aspects that are remedies (such as generosity). Thus, it is both emptiness and what makes one attain unsurpassable awakening. This emptiness en­dowed with all supreme aspects is nothing but the emptiness that is taught in the prajñápáramitá sütras and commented on by Nágárjuna. The reason is that this emptiness puts an end to all reference points and thus joins one with all the qualities of the paths, the bhümis, and the final fruition. There­fore, to deprecate the Madhyamaka view through clinging to subtle “empty forms” and so on as being this emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects is not good."},{"pageNumber":974,"pageContent":"958 Appendix 4In his introduction to the Seventh Karmapas commentary on the Pramánavárttika and other texts on valid cognition, the contemporary Karma Kagyii master Thrangu Rinpoche extensively quotes the Seventh Karmapa’s student Karma Trinlépa as confirming the Karmapas position that Dignága and Dharmaklrti are Yogácára-Mádhyamikas or “Great Mádh- yamikas” (which are equivalent for the Karmapa). Thrangu Rinpoche adds that “this kind of middle path also accords with the texts of Nágárjuna and his successors, and it is clear that it is not different from the intended mean­ing of the Madhyamaka that was transmitted from venerable Maitreya via Asanga and his brother.” He concludes:As for the meaning taught here, Madhyamaka is not the self-emptiness whose nature is a nonimplicative negation (an emptiness in the sense of extinction), but the ultimate reality that is the other-emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects. This is not [just] labeling the view of Mere Mentalism with the name Shentong. It is clearly nothing but what the sütra collections of definitive meaning teach, what the great chariots comment on, and what the yogins who found siddhis familiar­ize with—the heart of the teachings, the path of the great Madhyamaka free from extremes.2903In the vajrayána teachings and in accordance with the four empow­erments, the term “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects” is explained as indicating the inseparability of appearance and emptiness, lu­minosity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and awareness and emptiness. In particular, the union of the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects and great bliss is explained as representing the secret candall and the mean­ing of EVAM. With regard to the Kálacakratantra, the term Srlkalacakra is explained as follows: kala (time) refers to changeless great bliss; cakra (wheel), to the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects; and sri (glo­rious), to this bliss and emptiness being nondual. This “wheel of time” ap­pears as “the outer” (worldly realms), “the inner” (the vajra body), and “the other” (the phenomena of the mandala circle).

These are called “empty forms”2907 and are regarded as actual manifestations of m inds true nature—naturally luminous and changeless wisdom. The essence of this wisdom is the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects, and its nature is changeless great bliss. This wisdom appears as those ten signs through special methods that are embraced by nonconceptual samadhi. Here, “all aspects” refers to these illusion­like “empty forms,” which are inseparable from emptiness. “Supreme” means that this emptiness does not merely consist of the negation of the real existence of physical matter. These “empty forms” are also often compared to images that appear in mirror divinations. On this, YDC (320 and 273) quotes two passages from the Vimalaprabhd commentary on the Kalacakratantra:This is the phase of being perfected as inner awareness, prajnaparamita, natural luminosity, Mahamudra, and the natural outflow of the dhar- madhatu s having the form of innate joy. Vajrasattva and the mother of the buddhas are not the sphere of dependently arisen faculties but the sphere of the supreme faculty. They have the nature of utterly change­less bliss, are beyond phenomena [made] of subtle particles, and re­semble [images in] mirror divinations and dreams. These are said to be the innate kaya (sahajakaya) of the victors because their nature is utterly changeless.2908And:Mahamudra is the one characterized by all dharmas that lack a nature of their own, is the one endowed with all supreme aspects, is pra­jnaparamita, and the one that gives rise to [all] buddhas.

The dharmas that lack a nature of their own are the eighty-four thousand collections of dharmas such as the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses.2909In the introduction to his commentary on the M adhyamakàvatàra, the Eighth Karmapa says that in the vajrayana, the wisdom without any du­alistic appearances of the latent tendencies of mistakenness entails many aspects (such as joy, “great attachment,” and the prajnà that realizes empti­ness and compassion) and thus cannot be said to be without any aspects.2910 Also, in the vajrayana, a wisdom without aspects is not reasonable as the definitive meaning because the wisdom that is endowed with all supreme aspects is presented as the definitive meaning through greatly praising it. The phrase “being endowed with all aspects” in M anjusnnàm asam gïti X.3a means that this wisdom has the function of seeing through unmistaken and nonconceptual direct (yogic) perception. The phrase “being without aspects” in the same line of text refers to this wisdom s being beyond min­ute particles and being free from any conceptions. Thus, “being endowed with all aspects and being without aspects” refers to great prajnàpàramità— the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme aspects. Also, it is refuted in the vajrayàna that wisdom s own unique object is without aspect, while it is taught that the fruition of omniscience is attained by virtue of familiarizing with the wisdom of realizing the emptiness that is endowed with all aspects. If no aspects appeared for nondual wisdom, the explanations of it as being omniscience or “all-knowing” would not be feasible because it is not suit­able to apply a plural if wisdom is presented as having nothing but itself as its object. Thus, it is through the power of the cognitive obscurations of nondual wisdom having been relinquished that it is the knowledge of all the aspects that can be known. In its knowing all aspects of all phenom­ena, unmistaken nondual wisdom (as well as its samàdhis) is established as self-awareness and not some blank inanimate emptiness or a state without any mental activity at all.In the Mahâmudrâ tradition, we find a similar use of the term. For ex­ample, a short Mahâmudrâ text by Mipham Rinpoche on stillness, move­ment, and awareness says:Through directly looking at the nature of that mind that is still or moves, you will realize that it is empty in that any possible essence of whatever appears in whatever ways is not established.

When you realize this secret pith of the mind, despite there being no looker that is different from something to be looked at, the fundamental state of naturally luminous mind as such is experienced. This is called “recognizing awareness.”2911TOK says that in the context of tantra Mahamudra, mudra (“seal”) re­fers to the notion of “union.”2912 Since the nature of this union pervades all phenomena, it is “great” (maha), that is, there are no phenomena that go beyond it. Such union is threefold. All outer appearances are the union of appearance and emptiness, while all forms of inner awareness that per­ceive these appearances are the union of awareness and emptiness. These two kinds of union are called “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects.” All feelings of those appearances and awareness meeting are the union of bliss and emptiness, which is called “utterly changeless great bliss.” Through taking the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects as the object that is to be perceived and through taking the realization of the entirety of this emptiness as being changeless great bliss as the perceiv­ing subject, subject and object fuse into one.

Refuting that the disposition is mere awareness Some say, “The nature of phenomena with stains and the factor that con­sists of the bearers of this nature are sheer primordially abiding awareness, and both are the naturally abiding disposition. Otherwise, buddha wisdom would lack a substantial cause.” Since mere awareness is a factor that is a bearer of the nature of phenomena, it is not reasonable that it is naturally luminous mind—self-arisen wisdom. Since it is primordially abiding, it is not a newly accomplished clear realization either. Therefore, if analyzed, it does not go beyond being the generality or the particular instances of the eight collections of impure consciousness. In that case, it is not tenable as the naturally abiding disposition because it is an obscuration. “But this mere awareness is luminous mind.” This is not tenable because it contra­dicts what Mahayanasutralamkara XIII. 19cd says:Apart from the mind that is the nature of phenomena, no other mindIs proclaimed to be luminous in nature.963"},{"pageNumber":980,"pageContent":"964 Appendix 5The Madhyântavibhàgatïkâ too says the same.

First, it isluminosity, all-empty, buddha wisdom, vajra wisdom, unsurpassablewisdom ...1.2. Through reasoning, refuting that it is a nonimplicative negation Some explain the mere lack of arising of the mind and the mere lack of real existence of all phenomena as the disposition. The isolate that is the mere negation of arising and real existence is a nonimplicative negation. This is not tenable as the disposition because then it follows that the horn of a rab­bit too would be the disposition. If it is said that the basis of negation is the disposition, the question is what is claimed to be the basis of negation—the nature of phenomena or the bearers of this nature. In the first case, our own assertion is established, and it is a good phrasing of the meaning of the text. In the second case, it would very absurdly follow that all seeming phenomena are the disposition. Furthermore, it is taught that it is a mistake to claim the nature of phenomena to be a nonimplicative negation. Here, YDC quotes the Kâlacakratantra and says that this means that connate wis­dom is taught as the mantrayàna and is asserted as the ultimate definitive meaning. This is followed by three passages from the Mahâbherïsütram5 that, in brief, say that in the future some who are afraid of the mere words “self” and “what is mine” will propound the lack of a self and great emp­tiness and thus will not have faith in sûtras like this one that speak of the tathâgata heart as being permanent and the Buddhas having a permanent self but will doubt them and be mistaken about them. People who are lazy, have corrupt discipline, and do not control their body, speech, and mind will discard such sûtras and instead train in those that speak about empti­ness.

The Hevajratantra says:“O Bhagavan, what is impure?” The Bhagavân said, “[All phenomena] such as form. Why? Because they are the entities of apprehender and apprehended.”2916The Vimalaprabhd commentary on the Kalacakratantra states:That from which blood, urine, and semen arise is not the dharma source.2917And:Sentient beings are not buddhas because they lack the qualities of bud­dhas and dwell in samsara.2918The Hevajrapindârthatïkâ says:The outer skandhas with stains such as feces are not deities here. The faces and hands of deities are not perfect buddhas—they are deliber­ately imagined by thoughts.2919Thus, the tathàgata heart is the sphere of those trained in “the three bodhi- sattva commentaries.”29202. The presentation of what is established through scripture andreasoningThis has two parts:1. The naturally abiding disposition2. The unfolding disposition"},{"pageNumber":982,"pageContent":"966 Appendix 52.1. The naturally abiding dispositionIt is the naturally luminous true nature of the mind that is primordially present in a self-arisen manner free from reference points. This true na­tures own essence is without different phases such as being pure or impure and is of single taste in everything, just like space. However, in dependence on individual sentient beings, it is labeled in many ways, such as pure and impure. By virtue of that, it is presented as the naturally abiding disposition by primarily referring to its phase of being impure.2.2. The unfolding dispositionThe precious omniscient dharma lord of the degenerate time (Dolpopa) and his successors assert that it, just as the naturally abiding disposition, is primordially abiding. It is obvious that the intention behind this is that the unfolding disposition is the factor of awareness and that the expanse and awareness are inseparable. Here, it is difficult to assert that the awareness that is the factor of the bearers of the nature of phenomena is the primor­dially abiding unfolding disposition since this was already refuted above. If it is identified as the disposition that is the factor of the true nature of phe­nomena, it would simply be equivalent to the naturally abiding disposition. Most masters explain it as all the virtues that are newly accomplished and serve as the causes of liberation, which is obvious as the intention of the Mahayanasutralamkara, the BodhisattvabhumU and so on. As explained above and below, the basic nature of these two dispositions, just as it is, is the sphere of buddhas alone. Therefore, how could it be an object of anal­ysis by someone like me?Nevertheless, if it is explained by following the scriptures, this dharma- dhatu is wisdom, is endowed with all kinds of qualities without exception in a self-arisen manner, is naturally liberated from all obscurations, and abides such that it pervades all knowable objects like space. That it is not seen despite its existence is due to the influence of the individual karmas of sentient beings. Since it is explained in that way, that is all one is able to understand.3. Rebutting objections to thatIt may be said, “If the dharmadhatu were wisdom, it would arise and cease.” This is not certain for the following reasons. It is the wisdom that is beyond moments because the Kdlacakratantra says that the wisdom that is free from one or many moments is the true reality of the victors. It also says that this wisdom is without coming and going—even if one puts water in a vase, it is"},{"pageNumber":983,"pageContent":"The Explanation o/Tathâgatagarbha in YDC 967not that space goes away. Just like that is the all-pervading vajra of space in the middle of the body, free from objects. The Hevajrapindârthatïkâ says:Just as space does not perish Through a vases perishing,So wisdom will not perish Through the bodys perishing.2921Furthermore, invalidating statements about what was said above, such as its following that sentient beings have relinquished the two obscurations, that they have completed the two accumulations, that they perform buddha activity, and that cultivating the path is pointless, are nothing but criticisms without having examined this properly. The first two should be answered by distinguishing existing (yodpa) and being something (yin pa). As for the third one, the regent Maitreya himself has rebutted it in the Uttaratantra:So the lord of dharma in sentient beings, whose body is not released from the husks of the afflictions,Will not grant the pleasant flavor of the dharma to the people pained by the hunger of the afflictions.2922The fourth one is not certain either because, despite its existence, the stainless tathàgata heart is not attained without practicing the path.Later, YDC2923 also disagrees with the assertion that the fully qualified sugata heart exists only during the phase of being completely pure (bud- dhahood), while it is only nominal at the time of sentient beings.2924 YDC presents the response of others to this assertion, saying that it would then follow that all passages in the Uttaratantra that teach the tathàgata heart as dwelling within the cocoons of the afflictions (such as the nine examples) are not proper explanations of the actuality of the tathàgata heart, just as it is. If that is accepted, it very absurdly follows that Maitreya was lying when he said in the UttaratantraHaving properly expounded the seven topical points .. ,2925YDC says that this response by others hits the point like lightnings striking ones head."},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"Appendix 6: The Presentation of the Purpose of Teaching Tathagatagarbha in Yeshe Dorjes Commentary on the UttaratantraThe following are YDCs comments (329-37) on Uttaratantra 1.158- 61/161-63. Note that, except for the quotes, this appendix is not a literal translation but a (sometimes abbreviated) paraphrase.1. The general topic This has two parts:1. General presentation of the three wheels of dharma2. Specific identification of the purpose of teaching the basic element1.1. The three wheels of dharm a This has three parts:1. Their individual distinctive features2. Identifying the expedient and the definitive meanings3. The order in which they were taught1.1.1. Their individual distinctive featuresYDC covers this point by simply quoting the Dharanisvararajasutra's ex­ample of the threefold purification of a beryl for the Buddha s three cycles of teaching the dharma.1.1.2. Identifying the expedient and the definitive meaningsYDC first quotes the well-known passage from the Samdhinirmocanasutra about the first dharma wheel on the four realities of the noble ones and the second one on emptiness being of expedient meaning, while the third one of excellent distinction is of definitive meaning.2926 Then, YDC comments on the passage that the first wheel was taught as an expedient meaning in order to introduce those to be guided into the teachings, while both the second and third wheels contain passages of both expedient and definitive969"},{"pageNumber":986,"pageContent":"970 Appendix 6meanings. The second wheel is predominantly of expedient meaning be­cause it teaches primarily the aspect of everything being nonexistent in order to put an end to clinging to real entities. The third wheel is predom­inantly of definitive meaning because it really gets to the bottom of things by excellently distinguishing what is existent and what is nonexistent, what is empty and what is not empty, what is the true nature and what is adven­titious, and so on. Some say that this passage in the Samdhinirmocanasutra is of expedient meaning, but this is not tenable because the Buddha says shortly after it:This is the teaching of the definitive meaning. Hold on to it as the teaching of the definitive meaning.2927It may be said, “This is the system of the Mere Mentalists, and since the Mere Mentalists assert this as the definitive meaning there is no contra­diction.” This is not tenable either because it would very absurdly follow that the Dharanisvararajasutra, the M ahaparinirvanasutra, and others are texts of the Mere Mentalists because the same is taught in them too. The Mahaparinirvanasutra says that the sutra collection arises from the twelve branches of the Buddhas speech; the extensive collection (which includes the bodhisattva sutras), from the sutra collection; the prajnaparamita sutras, from the extensive collection; and the M ahaparinirvanasutra, from the prajnaparamita sutras, just as the pure essence of butter gradually arises from milk.2928 This sutra also says about itself that it is a great collection of merit because it teaches that the tathagata heart is permanent.2929 The Vivrtagudharthapindavyakhya states:Thus, it is in terms of those to be guided that teachings are inferior or superior. For example, [the Buddha] taught something inferior for the sake of the two merchants Trapusa and Bhallika2930 because they were ordinary beings. [He taught] something intermediate for “the group of five”2931 because they were in the state of noble beings. For bodhisat- tvas, he taught the eight kinds of prajnaparamita, which are superiorby virtue of negating [all] aspects of imputation 2932 Teachings suchas the Saddharmapundarika[sutra] are very superior—through a single yanas being taught in them, they guide even those of uncertain dispo­sition into this [yana].

The teaching of the Buddhavatamsakasutra is the most supe­rior of what is very supreme—the Tathagata taught this sutra not long after he had become a fully perfect buddha a single time to the mighty lords of the ten bodhisattvabhumis who dwell in the ten directions.2933Also, the Uttaratantra says:Through his teachings about the true reality of phenomena,Such as in the Saddharmapundarika [sutra] .. ,2934It may be said, “Since these are also texts of the Mere Mentalists, they are of expedient meaning,” but then one must teach the scriptures and reasonings for such a claim. However, master Vasubandhu states in his Abhidharmakosabhasya:With the teacher s having passed into parinirvana, there was no leader of this teaching. Based on many different forms [of canons, people] still deal with words and meanings as they please. Now, what is there to do? For the time being, for those for whom this scripture is a valid one, the intermediate state is established through the scriptures.2935Accordingly, if one takes the scriptures of the victor and his children to be valid, the final dharma wheel is established as being of definitive m ean­ing. In particular, it is not feasible to explain the Uttaratantra as Mere Men- talism because it teaches that all sentient beings possess the buddha heart and it mainly teaches positions that contradict Mere Mentalism, such as the manner in which those who dwell in the nirvana without remainder of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas enter the mahayana.1.1.3. The order in which the three dharm a wheels were taught Some say that the three dharma wheels were taught in a progressive order, while Dharmamitra holds that the Buddha taught all of them simultane­ously, with the division into a second, a third, and so on, being just the way it appears for those to be guided. However, it is not tenable that they were given in a strict progressive order because the Buddha taught the first wheel too from after his awakening up through being about to pass into parinir­vana, that is, he started with teaching “the group of five” and ended with the Parivrajika Subhadra. Nor is there any certainty that the three wheels were taught simultaneously because ultimately the Buddha did not utter"},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"972. Appendix 6any dharma at all, but what appears that way on the level of seeming reality for those to be guided must be presented as being spoken by the Buddha. Also, Uttaratantra 1.160/163 speaks of what was taught “before” and what is taught “later.”1.2. Specific identification of the purpose of teaching the basic element This has three parts:1. Refuting wrong explanations about it2. Explaining what the purpose is3. Rebutting disputes1.2.1. Refuting wrong explanations about itSome say, “It is taught with many examples in the root texts and commen­taries of the final dharma wheel that the sugata heart, in which the qualities are intrinsically complete, pervades all sentient beings. This is a teaching that bears an intention. Its basis of intention is the dharmadhatu2936 or the álaya.2937 Its purpose is to relinquish the five flaws. W hat invalidates the explicit statement is that it would otherwise not be different from the view of the Sámkhyas and that there would be a real entity.” Sherab Sengé says that the teaching on the sugata heart bears an intention because something like a sugata heart is not observable. The refutation of these claims has three parts:1. The bases of intention are not tenable]2. The purpose is not established3. There is no invalidation of the teaching on the tathágata heart1.2.1.1. The bases of intention are not tenableThe dharmadhatu is not suitable as the basis of intention of the sugata heart because these two are not different. It may be said, “The reason does not ap­ply because only buddhas possess the fully qualified sugata heart.” There is no proof for that but there are numerous invalidations because the many above-mentioned sütras and treatises, as well as Nágárjunas Sütrasamuc- caya declare that the dharmadhatu and the sugata heart are synonyms.Nor is the álaya tenable as the basis of intention because the sole present ornament of Jambudvipa, the precious dharma lord, said that there is no purpose in taking it as the basis of intention. “The reason does not apply because it was taught for the sake of gradually introducing the tlrthikas into the teachings.” I think that this purpose is already accomplished by the teaching on the álaya itself. “But since the álaya is labeled with the name"},{"pageNumber":989,"pageContent":"The Purpose o f Teaching Tathágatagarbha in YDC 973‘sugata heart’ in the Lañkávatárasütra, the Ghanavyühasütra, and others, it is the basis of intention of the sugata heart.” Indian scholars explain that this is a case of labeling what obscures with the name of what is obscured. Since this explanation is excellent, it is taught that the álaya is not the basis of intention.1.2.1.2. The purpose is not establishedThe above-mentioned purpose of relinquishing the five flaws is not estab­lished as one of the criteria for the teaching on the sugata hearts bearing an intention. For, if it were, it would follow that the clinging to the sugata hearts being nonexistent in sentient beings is not a deprecation because the sugata heart does in fact not exist in them.2938 If that is accepted, it follows that the purpose of eliminating the deprecation of clinging to its nonexis­tence is not accomplished through teaching that it exists (because it does not in fact exist).1.2.1.3. There is no invalidation of the teaching on the sugata heart This has three parts:1. The sugata heart does not accord with bad views2. It does not represent a real entity3. Its nonexistence is not established through not being observableL2.1.3.1. The sugata heart does not accord with’bad views It may be said, “If the sugata heart in which all qualities are complete ex­isted at the time of the ground, it would not be different from the Sámkhya assertion of the results existing at the time of the cause.” This is not the case. For the Lañkávatárasütra says:Mahámati, my teaching on the tathágata heart is not comparable to the tirthikas speaking of a self. Mahámati, the tathágata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, taught that the meaning of words such as emptiness, true end, nirvána, nonarising, signlessness, and wishless- ness is “tathágata heart.” Thus, they taught the door of the tathágata heart in order to relinquish the object of naive beings fear of the lack of a self. Through this, they taught the matrix of nonconceptuality, the sphere of nonappearance. Mahámati, the great bodhisattvas of the future and the present should not cling to this as a self.2939And:"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"974 Appendix 6Like a potter [making different vessels out of a single lump of clay], they taught this through all kinds of words and phrases. Therefore, Mahamati, the teaching on the tathagata heart is not like the teaching of the tirthikas’ proclaiming a self.2940Also, one should understand this to be like the difference between say­ing that gold exists in a treasure versus saying that a sprout exists in a seed. Some say, “The tathagata heart is of expedient meaning because this very sutra explains that it is taught in order to guide naive beings.” The omni­scient dharma lord has explained the purpose of labeling the expanse with the name “tathagata heart” and, in terms of the meaning of this, my omni­scient gurus also think alike.1.2.1.3.2. It does not represent a real entityIt may be said, “If such a tathagata heart existed ultimately, it would be a real entity.” This is not the case because it is not an entity. Also, at the time of all entities’ being the same, there is no flaw even if it were an entity. “It is not tenable for this tathagata heart to exist ultimately—ultimately, the nature of phenomena is like the horns of a rabbit.” It is not like that—it is explained to be “ultimate reality” because it is real as the object of ultimate wisdom.2941 As it is declared to be indestructible within being self-liberated:Since ultimate reality is what is unmistakenly realized by the noble ones, it is the seeing of the nature of phenomena being the lack of arising. Since this is the ultimate reality for those [noble ones], it is ultimate reality.1.2.1.3.3. Its nonexistence is not established through not being observableIt is not established that nobody can observe the tathagata heart because it is seen by the buddhas. Thus, it is not established as nonexistent through not being observable by those who just see this life. Therefore, this accords with the Pramdnavarttika:It was already explained that nonexistenceIs not established through nonobservability in all [subjects].2942"},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"The Purpose o f Teaching Tathagatagarbha in YDC 9751.2.2. Explaining what the purpose isTherefore, Uttaratantra 1.158-61 represents the explanation of the purpose of teaching the sugata heart, but it is not an explanation of the purpose of this teaching’s being one with an intention behind it.1.2.3. Rebutting disputesThis should be understand as in the above section 1.2.1.3. on there being no invalidation of the teaching on the tathagata heart.2. The meaning of the text2943 This has two parts:1. The intention of all phenomena’s being said to be nonexistent in the middle dharma wheel2. The purpose of teaching in the final dharma wheel that the basic element pervades everybody2.1. The intention of all phenom ena’s being said to be nonexistent in the middle dharma wheelIn terms of the unmistaken meaning, the true end—the basic element—is void or empty of conditioned phenomena in all aspects. W hat it is void of are afflictions, contaminated karma, and the maturations of these two, which resemble clouds, dreams, illusions, and so on. The afflictions resem­ble clouds because they are temporary, pervasive, and do not blend with the true nature. The actions of body and speech are like appearances expe­rienced in a dream because they are produced by mistakenness and are the focal objects of mistaken states of mind. The maturations of the afflictions (the causes) and karma (the conditions) are adventitious results like the magical manifestations in an illusion because they, in dependence on theses causes and conditions, appear and yet do not actually exist. These are the reasons for such a presentation in the second dharma wheel earlier.2.2. The purpose of teaching in the final dharma wheel that the basic element pervades everybodyLater, in this ultimate or later continuum (the final dharma wheel) here, it is taught that the basic element exists in all sentient beings. The purpose of this is, in brief, to relinquish the five flaws. Therefore, the second dharma wheel teaches primarily the way in which the phenomena of which the basis of emptiness is empty do not exist, while the third wheel teaches mainly the basis of emptiness, which is for the sake of that fivefold purpose. Therefore,"},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"976 Appendix 6there is no inner contradiction between these two dharma wheels. This way of being is also stated in the Angulimdliyasutra:Empty phenomena are other and nonempty phenomena are also other. Just like hailstones, the millions of afflictions are empty. Just like hail­stones, the phenomena that are nonvirtuous factors perish swiftly. Just like a beryl gem, the Buddha is permanent, and the end of liberationis like a beryl gem too Manjusri, an empty house built in a town isempty because it is without people. A vase is empty because it is without water. A river is empty because no water flows in it. Is that town’s space where there are no houses called “empty”? Is the house empty in all respects? It is not empty in all respects, but it is called “empty” because it is without people. Is the vase empty in all respects? It is not empty in all respects, but it is called “empty” because it is without water. Is the river empty in all respects? It is not empty in all respects, but it is called “empty” because no water flows in it. Likewise, liberation is not empty in all respects, but liberation is called “empty” because it is free from all flaws. The Buddha Bhagavan is not empty—he is called empty because he is free from all flaws and is without [the mind streams of] humans and gods with their millions of afflictions.2944W hat is intended here by saying “is not empty” is not being empty in the sense of being nothing whatsoever. As Manjusrlklrti says:The emptiness of analyzing all aspects Is without a core, just like a banana tree.The emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects Will never be like that.2945“The emptiness of analyzing all aspects” refers to the sheer emptiness of not finding anything at all if one analyzes through reasons such as the freedom from being a unity or a multiplicity.2946It may be said, “Isn’t this kind of emptiness (as described in the Angulimdliyasutra) taught to be the worst kind?” The gurus say that among the seven emptinesses listed in the Lankavatarasutra, it is the sixth one —the emptiness of one being empty of something other—that is taught to be the worst one, which corresponds to the emptiness of the entities presented above as examples being mutually empty of each other.

Note however that parts of the Ekottarikagama contain mahayana elements and thus seem to have been added later. Modern scholars have suggested that the mahayana evolved from within the Mahasamghika School and that even tathagatagarbha sutras such as the Srhnaladevisutra are mahayana outgrowths of the later Mahasamghika tradition.10. See Takasaki 1974, 67n24 (ayam sa tathagatagarbha dgacchati). This sutra as well as the Samdhininnocanasutra also use the terms “tathagata family” (tathdgatakula) and “buddha family” (buddhakula), though not in the sense of buddha nature.11.

The unrevised and revised sutras are close in content, but there are several passages in the latter that were added, omitted, or trans­posed so as to better conform to the outline of the Abhisamaydlamkara. The Tibetan versions of this chapter are contained in the translations of said revised sutra (D3790), the eighty-third chapter of the Astaddsdsdhasrikdprajndparamitasutra (DIO), and the seventy-second chapter of the Pancavimsatisdhasrikdprajndparamitdsutra (D9). The versions in DIO and D3790 correspond closely to the Sanskrit, while the version in D9 often differs in its use of technical terms and seems to have been based on a different Sanskrit manuscript. The Sanskrit edition has no title, while its versions in D9 and DIO are titled “The Chapter of the Distinctions in a Bodhisattva’s Training (byang chub setns dpai bslabpa la rab tuphye ba’i le'u).” Note that the “Maitreya Chapter” is missing in the Satasdhasrikdprajndparamitdsutra, in the Gilgit manuscript of the Astaddsdsahas- rikaprajhapdramitdsutra, and in all Chinese translations of the prajnaparamita sutras. Certain parts of this chapter differ in their diction from the rest of these sutras (and the prajnaparamita sutras in general) in that all phenomena from form up through the qualities of a buddha are divided into three aspects, such as “imaginary form (parikalpi- tam rupam),” “conceived form (vikalpitam rwpam),” and “dharmata-form (dharmatd- rupam)” Due to all this, most modern and even some traditional Tibetan scholars re­gard this chapter as a later addition to the Astaddsdsdhasrikdprajnaparamitdsutra and the Pahcavimsatisahasrikdprajnapdramitdsutra. In any case, most commentators agree that the three types of phenomena in this chapter and their descriptions correspond to the imaginary nature, the dependent nature, and the perfect nature, respectively. Some later Indian prajnaparamita commentaries (such as the Satasahasrikdprajndpdramita- brhattika, the Satasdhasrikdpancavimiatisdhasrikdstddasasdhasrikdprajndparamitd- brhattikdy and the Bhagavatydmndyanusdrini) adopted the three types of phenomena in the “Maitreya Chapter” as their basic exegetical template and explained the relation­ship between them according to the Shentong model of the relationship between the three natures (that is, the perfect natures being empty of both the imaginary and de­pendent natures). This is obviously the reason why Dolpopa and his followers included the “Maitreya Chapter” under the sutras of definitive meaning (in the sense of Shen­tong). In any case, this chapter does not contain any tathagatagarbha-related discus­sions.

It is not clear what exactly “the complete elaborations on the Mahdparinirvdna- sutra” means, but it probably refers to the parts in the longer version of this sutra that are not found in the shorter one plus the very brief addition that consists of D121. In any case, the Mahdparinirvdnasutra and its “elaborations” in this list cover D119-21.

As for the relationships between Dolpopa’s and Taranatha’s differing lists of sutras of definitive meaning, from the perspective of the usual Tibetan doxographical ranking, Taranatha’s differentiation between the four sutras of the definitive meaning of Mere Mentalism and those of the final definitive meaning suggests that he takes the former to be inferior to the latter. By contrast, Dolpopa includes the former four sutras in his general list of the ten sutras of definitive meaning. Among Taranatha’s seven explicitly mentioned sutras of the final definitive meaning, the first five also appear in Dolpopas list of ten tathdgatagarbha sutras, while the last two are found in his list of ten sutras of definitive meaning.

Needless to say, the topic of buddha nature is quite ubiquitous in the Buddhist tantras (for examples, see Hevajratantra, part 2, IV.69, as well as Hopkins 2006, 121-24 and 195). However, the treatment of tathagatagarbha and related notions in the tantras is not the topic of this study.49. The Tathagatagarbhasutra is preserved in one Tibetan (D258, fifteen folios) and two Chinese translations (Taisho 666 and 667). For a detailed study and translation of this sutra, see Zimmermann 2002 (see also Takasaki 1974, Diana M. Paul 1980, Grosnick 1995, and Zimmermann 1998). Note that, due to the largely general nature of the sketches of the teachings on tathagatagarbha in this and the following sutras, I do not always provide page references.50. In the Chinese version, this is found in the section called *Tathagatotpattisaiiibhava- nirdeia.51. J22-24.52. Taisho 668 (two pages). For a detailed study and translation of this sutra, see Shiu 2006.53. Sanskrit fragments of this sutra (three folios of the final section and two folios related to other sections) were recently discovered as part of a Buddhist manuscript collection in Afghanistan, somewhat ironically in a cave where Taliban forces had sought shelter. This collection was bought by the Norwegian collector Martin Schoyen, and the frag­ments of the Srlmaladevisutra were edited by M. Kazunobu in Buddhist Manuscripts I (Oslo: Hermes Publishing, 2000), 65-76. The sutra also exists in one Tibetan (D45.48, twenty-three folios) and two Chinese translations (Taisho 310 and 353). For English translations and studies, see Wayman and Wayman 1974 as well as Diana M. Paul 1979 and 1980.54. Note that, in Tibetan texts, this term is often understood as, or equated with, “those whose disposition is cut-off” (rigs chad), in the sense of people who do not possess any disposition for nirvana or buddhahood (agotraka) and thus will never attain it. How­ever, if “disposition” (gotra) is understood as an equivalent of buddha nature, many sutras, RGW, and other texts explain that there is nobody who does not possess it. On the other hand, if “disposition” is understood as roots of virtue (as in some other sutras and Yogacara texts such as the Mahayanasutrdlamkara), one speaks of beings who have no disposition for nirvana because they lack any roots of virtue. Still, there are different opinions as to whether this means that these beings will never attain nirvana or are eventually able to attain it through accumulating virtue at some point in the fu­ture. For details on this issue, see the note on the potential verse from the Abhidharma- mahayanasutra in the translation of R G W (J37)."},{"pageNumber":1005,"pageContent":"Notes 98955. As elaborated in a note on R G W ’s explanation of this term (J75), it entails some ambi­guity because it can be understood as being distracted by or from emptiness. To be dis­tracted by emptiness refers to being distracted by a wrong understanding of emptiness (such as taking it to be nihilism or clinging to emptiness as an entity). To be distracted from emptiness means to be distracted from the correct understanding of emptiness, which RG W identifies as the principle of what emptiness means in the case of the tathagata heart.56. According to K. Takao (see Shiu 2006, 79), based on his research on the development of the four characteristics of the dharmakaya as being permanent, blissful, pure, and a self, the Bodhisattvagocaropayavisayavikurvananirdeiasutra was the third-earliest sutra on tathdgatagarbha. However, I could not even find any mention of the dharmakaya, let alone its having these four characteristics, in the Tibetan version of this sutra (D146).57. This sutra is available in one Tibetan (D147, 101 folios) and two Chinese translations (Taisho 398 and part of Taisho 397). Anne Burchardi informed me that she is currently working on an English translation from the Tibetan (available in 2016 in the Reading Room of the 84,000 Project).58. D147, fol. 174b.1-2 and passim.59. J25.60. See Ruegg 1969, 113.61. Still, the description of these thirty-two qualities is by no means uncommon since they are found in several other sutras as well. Note also that the sutra does not mention the thirty-two qualities of the rupakayas listed in the Uttaratantra (in the latter, these qual­ities are explained according to the Ratnadarikasutra).62. Usually, this means to be free from the three notions of agent, object, and action. How­ever, the Dhdranisvararajasutra itself explains this purity of the three spheres as the state in which mind does not engage in the three times. It says that due to the non­abiding of mind, mentation, and consciousness, there is no conceiving of the past, no thinking about the future, and no discursiveness about what occurs at present. In effect, this means that all eight consciousnesses do not operate in this state (in the triad of “mind, mentation, and consciousness,” “mind” refers to the alaya-consciousness; “mentation,” to the afflicted mind; and “consciousness,” to the six remaining con­sciousnesses). Also, mind’s not engaging in the three times as described is reminiscent of similar instructions in the Mahamudra tradition.63. For details on all these passages in the sutra, see R G W (J3-6) and CMW (435-52).64. DJgha Nikaya 16.65. There are several Sanskrit fragments of this sutra, three that were found earlier (see Takasaki 1971, 1024-23) and several others that were edited by M. Allon and R. Salo­mon in Buddhist Manuscripts I (Oslo: Hermes Publishing, 2000), 243-73. Otherwise, this sutra is preserved in two Tibetan (D119,339 folios; D120,151 folios) and four Chi­nese translations (Taisho 374-377; 377 is an addition to the actual sutra). Note that the longer Tibetan version D119 is a combination of Taisho 374 and 377, while the shorter version D120 is a direct translation of the Indian source and corresponds in its contents to Taisho 376. As already mentioned, Dolpopa appears to refer to D119 and D120 as the Mahdparinirvdnasutra and the Parinirvanasutra, respectively. The Kangyur also contains a third very short text called Mahdparinirvdnasutra (D121, two folios), which however consists only of a number of prophecies of the Buddha about what will hap­pen to his teachings after certain numbers of years after his death have passed. There are two English translations of the Mahdparinirvdnasutra from the Chinese by Kosho Yamamoto (3 vols., Karinbunko, 1973-75 and 12 vols., London 1999-2000) as well"},{"pageNumber":1006,"pageContent":"990 Notesas an unpublished translation from the Tibetan by Stephen Hodge. For details on the treatment of tathagatagarbha in the Mahaparinirvdnasutra, see Takasaki 1971, Ming- Wood 1982 and 1984, and Page 2003.66. Note that the assertion that buddha nature and ultimate reality are free from, or be­yond, dependent origination is one of Dolpopa’s key positions.67. Lit. “the five without interval” (often translated as the “five heinous crimes”). They consist of killing one’s father, ones mother, or an arhat, creating a schism in the samgha, and intentionally causing blood to flow from the body of a buddha. They are called “with immediate consequence” or “without interval” because their result is rebirth in a hell realm immediately after death, without the interval of an intermediate state (bardo) before this next rebirth.68. This contrast is even more striking in the longer version of the sutra (D119 and Taisho 374), in which chapters 1 to 5 deny that those with great desire possess buddha na­ture and attain buddhahood. Chapters 6 to 9 are somewhat ambiguous on this issue, continuing to utterly despise those with great desire but also saying that there are two types of them—those who possess roots of virtue at present and those who will have roots of virtue in the future. Finally, chapters 10 to 13 are very emphatic about those with great desire possessing buddha nature and having the definite capacity for future buddhahood once they abandon their evil ways and accumulate the roots of virtue that they lack only temporarily. This section also says that buddha nature cannot be cut off because it is neither past, present, or future.69. D213 (eighty-one folios) and Taisho 527.70. Majjhima Nikaya 86.71.

As already mentioned, the example of a lamp in a vase for buddha natures being ob­scured by adventitious stains is also found in the Mahabherlsutra (D222, fol. 110b. 1) and Nagarjunas Dharmadhatustava (verses 5-7).76. D222 (forty-three folios) and Taisho 270. There exists an anonymous English trans­lation from the Chinese (http://www.sutrasmantras.info/sutral9.html). The Nalanda Translation Committee is currently working on an English translation from the Ti­betan and Chinese (available in 2016 in the Reading Room of the 84,000 Project).77. The Jhanamudrdsamadhisutra also says that there will be some people in the future who do not seek the dharma but material gain, do not control their body and mind, claim to train in awakening, like to talk, and say that everything is empty. They do not understand emptiness as it is. Those who, by focusing on emptiness as being unarisen, not being created by anyone, being invisible, and being without coming and going say that they are training well in emptiness are thieves of the dharma. However, this sutra does not link these statements to what the Mahabherlsutra says here otherwise, but they seem to refer to people for whom emptiness is just lip service or who fixate on empti­ness as being such and such (Mipham Rinpoches Synopsis of the Sugata Heart quotes the Jhanamudrdsamadhisutra in support of not misunderstanding buddha nature as emptiness in a nihilistic sense or as a nonimplicative negation).78. Compare the example in the Samyuktagama (Taisho 1246, 341b-42a) of a goldsmiths washing away layers of gravel, sand, and dirt to reveal gold in gold ore, just as it is, in its perfect color and luster.79.

Vaidya (Darbhanga: Mithila Institute, 1963). The sutra is also preserved in two Tibetan (D107,136 folios and D108, ninety-three folios) and three Chinese translations (Taisho 670-72). D107 corresponds closely to Nanjio’s Sanskrit edition, while D108 is a Tibetan translation of the Chinese one by Gunabhadra (Taisho 670). This translation lacks the first and the last two of the longer version’s ten chapters, which were obviously added later (as was probably the eighth one). The first, eighth, and ninth chapters are not at all related to the other chapters. Though the tenth chapter (entirely in verse) repeats over two hundred verses from the preceding chapters, about 680 verses are new. Many of them appear to be quite random, while some show significant differ­ences in contents from the other chapters. Generally, except for the last chapter, most parts of the sutra are taught in both a prose and a verse portion. As Shiu (2006, 171) reports, according to Fazang, when he assisted Siksananda with the translation of the Lankdvatarasutra, he was faced with a total of five different versions of the work, and they had to carefully collate these different versions while also comparing their colla­tion with the two earlier Chinese translations. The style of a collation or compilation of different sources is likewise obvious in the extant Sanskrit version and the Tibetan translation (naturally, it is very hard to tell what is to be considered “original” and what has been added later). For English translations and studies of this sutra, see Suzuki 1930 and 1979, Sutton 1991, and Red Pine 2012. For a comparison of the Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit versions, see Suzuki 1979,14-37.81. Unless one follows CMW’s equation of the Prakrit verse about tathagatas’ becoming visible like gold in stony debris being purified in RGW (J6) with the similar verse X.751 in the Lankdvatarasutra.82.

A more literal (and more correct) translation of the classical Yogacara term “false imag­ination” (Skt. abhutaparikalpa, Tib. yang dag ma yin pa’i kun rtog), also found in the Uttaratantra and RGW, is “imagination of what is unreal.” That is, what is meant is not that the imagination (parikalpa; which is equivalent to the dependent nature) itself is false or unreal (though it is ultimately so) but what it imagines (parikalpita; the imag­inary nature) is unreal. Nevertheless, I chose “false imagination” since “imagination of what is unreal” appears to be too long and unwieldy a term and because “false” in “false imagination” (instead of “unreal imagination”) can be understood as referring to the essentially mistaken mode of operation of imagination, which implies that what is imagined is false or unreal too. In Yogacara in particular, the terms “imagination” (parikalpa) and “conception” (kalpana, vikalpa, and their cognates) refer to all the lev­els of the continuous, constructive yet deluded activity of the mind that never tires of producing all kinds of dualistic appearances and experiences, thus literally building its own samsaric world.D88. Lankdvatarasutra, Nanjio ed., 77.13-78.1; D107, fols. 85.b.7-86a.3.89. The five dharmas, which are taught in many mahayana scriptures, are names, causal features, imagination, perfect wisdom, and suchness. (1) “Names” are mere designa­tions, such as “book.” (2) “Causal features” (Skt. nimitta can mean both “cause” and"},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"992 Notes“characteristic” and is to be understood in this double sense here) refers to the bases for such designations, that is, dualistically appearing entities that on the level of seeming reality, perform functions and have certain characteristics. (3) Here, “imagination” is a collective term for the eight kinds of consciousness. (4) “Perfect wisdom” bears this name because it is the perceiving subject of suchness. (5) “Suchness” is the ultimate object to be focused on through the path—the dharmadhatu. Among these, (1) corre­sponds to the imaginary nature, (2)—(3) represent the dependent nature, and (4)—(5) are the perfect nature in terms of subject and object (or the unmistaken and unchang­ing perfect nature), respectively.90.

That is, the fruitions of the three Buddhist yanas.97. Lankdvatdrasutra, Nanjio ed., 78.5-79.11; D107, fol. 86a.4-86b.5.98. “Active consciousnesses” refers to the mental consciousness and the five sense consciousnesses.99. Note that this paragraph bears some resemblance with Angulimalas response to Man- jusrl about properly distinguishing what is empty and what is not empty. This is further highlighted by the version of the first sentence in this paragraph that is mentioned in Shiu (2006, 171) and is found only in Bodhirucis Chinese translation of the Lcifikd- vatarasutra (Taisho 671, 559c; maybe a lost version of the sutra), while it is absent in all other Chinese and Tibetan translations as well as the extant Sanskrit version: “Mahamati, the notion of momentariness is known as ‘empty.’ The alaya-conscious­ness, which is known as the tathagata heart, without the latent tendencies of the common active consciousnesses is known as ‘empty.’ Being replete with the latent ten­dencies of uncontaminated phenomena, it is known as ‘nonempty.’”100. These four are as follows. (1) The latent tendencies of expression are such as those that have power over an eye consciousness’s apprehending blue appearing as the basis of the conceptual clinging of apprehending blue in such a way that this basis appears to be established through its own specific characteristics. (2) The latent tendencies of views about a self are those that have power over giving rise to views of clinging to a self through making a split between oneself and others. (3) The latent tendencies of the branches of existence are those of virtuous and nonvirtuous karmas, which have the power to accomplish all kinds of births and deaths in samsaric existence. (4) The latent tendencies of similar class are such as those that have the power over blues appearing as blue for an eye consciousness’s apprehending blue.101.

Note that this re­sembles the presentation of the alaya-consciousness in contrast with the uncontam­inated latent tendencies of listening in the first chapter of the Mahdydnasamgraha. These latent tendencies of listening coexist with the alaya-consciousness like a mix of milk and water, but they are the seeds of the dharmakaya and the remedy for the alaya-consciousness. Since they are the natural outflow of the supramundane utterly pure dharmadhatu, they are the seeds of the supramundane mind."},{"pageNumber":1009,"pageContent":"Notes 993102.

Asahga’s Abhidharmasamuccaya (in general, in the notes, the name of the author of a text will be mentioned only with the first citation of that text) (D4049, fols. 99b.7- 100a.3) lists twenty-four kinds of impregnations of negative tendencies in terms of (1) expressions (which are omnipresent), (2) feelings, (3) afflictions, (4) karma, (5) matu­ration, (6) afflictive obscurations, (7) karmic obscurations, (8) maturational obscura­tions, (9) obscurations, (10) examination, (11) food, (12) sexual union, (13) dreams, (14) illnesses, (15) aging, (16) death, (17) fatigue, (18) being solid, (19) being great, (20) being medium, (21) being small, (22) afflictive obscurations, (23) obscurations of meditative absorption, and (24) cognitive obscurations. Sthiramati’s Abhidharma- samuccayavyakhyd (D4054, fol. 230a.4-230b.7) explains that all of these refer to certain latent tendencies in the alaya-consciousness. (1) refers to the latent tendencies of the omnipresent clinging to the names of all phenomena, which have followed one since beginningless time. They are also called “the latent tendencies of proliferating reference points” because the aspects of such clinging to names arise again and again. (2)-(4) refer to the latent tendencies of contaminated feelings, afflictions, and karma, respec­tively. (5) are the latencies of dysfunctional karmic maturations, (6) the nonexhaustion and the long continuum of the afflictions, (7) obstacles to the path, such as the five actions without interval, (8) the antagonistic factors to the clear realization of reality— obtaining the bodies of hell beings and so on, (9) the obstacles to engaging in virtue- being overpowered by striving for sense pleasures and so on, (10) the obstacles to being ordained—being overwhelmed by examining sense pleasures and so on, (11) not eating moderately (either very little or too much), (12) the physical and mental harm due to intercourse, (13) the seemingly physical body that is experienced by virtue of being asleep, (14) the experiences of unease due to the elements in the body being unbal­anced, (15) being powerless in terms of the change of these elements, (16) all faculties being disturbed when dying, (17) physical exhaustion due to long walks and so on, (18) being joined to all the preceding latent tendencies in their respectively concordant ways and thus not passing into nirvana, (19)—(21) being engaged in the realms of desire, form, and formlessness, respectively, (22) the antagonistic factors to the awakenings of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, (23) the antagonistic factors to accomplishing the nine meditative absorptions of progressive abiding, and (24) the antagonistic factors to omniscience. All of these are fully relinquished on the path of nonlearning, when the liberations of mind and prajna are accomplished. Sthiramati’s Sutrdlamkdravrttibhasya (D4034, fols. 120b.6-121a.l) explains that those two liberations refer to the freedom from the afflictions (nirvana) and the freedom from ignorance (omniscient wisdom), respectively. The first one means to be liberated from the afflictions to be relinquished through the paths of seeing and familiarization, which arises from the lack of attach­ment.

Obviously, this verse could have been a source for Paramartha’s teachings on a ninth consciousness, the *amalavijnana (see the chapter “The Uttaratantra and Its Relation­ship to Yogacara”).113. Similar to the Samdhinirmocanasutra, the Lankdvatarasutra (Nanjio ed., 45.1-9; D107, fol. 72b.3-6) also states that the alaya-consciousness is so subtle that it is very difficult to be realized by anybody (such as ¿ravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and tlrthikas) but buddhas and bodhisattvas on the bhumis.114. Nanjio ed., 222.20-224.1; D107, fols. 143b.6-144a.6.

Here, the second line could mean either “the realms of sentient beings” or “the basic elements of sentient beings” in the sense of tathagatagarbha. With the latter meaning, this verse would be an even clearer parallel to Uttaratantra 1.52-63, which describes the arising and ceasing of the skandhas and so on within the space-like purity of the mind, without the latters ever being affected by this arising and ceasing.117.

O sons of the victors, likewise, to the extent that bodhisattvas make offerings to the buddha bhagavans, make efforts in ma­turing sentient beings, and are in a state of adopting these kinds of dharmas that purify the bhumis, to that extent their roots of virtue that they dedicate to omniscience will become refined, pure, and pliable as they please.”126.

In sum, these sutras use the notion of emptiness not in a mahayana sense but exactly as it is typically understood in the Pali canon: “Emptiness as a quality of dharmas, in the early canons, means simply that one cannot identify them as ones own self or having anything pertaining to one’s own self.... Emptiness as a mental state, in the early can­ons, means a mode of perception in which one neither adds anything to nor takes any­thing away from what is present, noting simply, ‘There is this.’ This mode is achieved through a process of intense concentration, coupled with the insight that notes more and more subtle levels of the presence and absence of disturbance” (Robinson, John­son, and Thanissaro Bhikku 2004, 96).140. There are six quotes or references in the Mahaydnasamgraha (which, accord­ing to its colophon in the three Chinese translations, is a chapter of the Abhidhar- mamahaydnasutra), two in Sthiramati’s Madhydntavibhagatikdy one in the same authors Trimsikabhasya, one in his Pancaskandhaprakaranavaibhdsya, one in Gunaprabha’s Pancaskandhavivarana, one in Asanga’s Abhidharmasamuccaya, one (or possibly two) in RGW, three in the *Vijhaptimatratasiddhi {CWengwei-shih lun; Taisho 1585), and one in K’uei-ki’s Wei-shih erh-shih lun shu-chi (Taisho 1834).

As for sutras of definitive meaning in general, the Gelug and Sakya schools assert the second wheel of dharma to be of definitive meaning. In addition, the Gelugpas hold the third wheel to be of expedient meaning, while the Sakyapas, as exemplified by Gorampa, assert at least some tathagatagarbha sutras too to be of definitive meaning (though not in the same manner in which others regard them as being of definitive meaning). However, when speaking of sutras that teach the ultimate definitive meaning as understood from the point of view of taking the teachings on tathagatagarbha (or the Shentong view in general) as that ultimate definitive meaning, the prajnaparamita sutras are clearly not of definitive meaning.163. Note that the Chinese tradition chose the meaning “womb” or “enclosure” of garbha to render tathagatagarbha and developed the notion that buddha nature pervades all phenomena, both animate and inanimate. The first occurrence of the position that in­animate things such as grasses and trees also have buddha nature is found in Chi-tsangs (549-623) Ta-ch'enghsiian-lun (Taisho 45,40b; see Koseki 1980).164.

Tib. ’Gos lo tsa ba gzhon nu dpal.166. GC, 262.24-263.4.167. 14.168. Sutton (1991,53) refers to the Fo xing lun {*Buddhadhatuiastra\\ Taisho 1610), which is attributed to Vasubandhu, as saying that garbha has three meanings: (1) the garbha that is enveloped, (2) the garbha that is hidden, and (3) the garbha that is envelop­ing. Therefore, all beings are said to have or to be tathagatagarbha because (1) they are included in suchness (the nature of buddhas), (2) a tathagata is not manifest in beings but is concealed in them, and (3) all buddha qualities are present in all sen­tient beings in a potential form. In the Fo xing lun, tathagatagarbha is explained to be of five kinds (following the Srimaladevisutra): (1) having the meaning of the nature (svabhdva) that includes all phenomena (tathagatadhatu), (2) the saddharmagarbha as the cause of all virtuous dharmas, corresponding to the nature of all tathagatas, (3) the dharmakayagarbha, which has the sense of attainment or mastery, (4) the supramun- dane garbha (lokottaragarbha), in which garbha means true reality (tattva), and (5) the naturally pure garbha (prakrtisuddhagarbha), which implies that the naturally pure true nature of all phenomena is concealed as the inner nature of all tathagatas.169. For a detailed analysis of the term taf/iagatagarbha, see Zimmermann 2002, 39-46.170. 5.1-7.24.171. The introduction of JKC (12-13) includes an abbreviated version of the discussion of these eight meanings of the tathagata heart in GC and adds a few points. Here, JKC says that these eight ways of explaining the tathagata heart represent different ways of describing it in terms of its three phases of being impure, impure and pure, and completely pure and also in terms of having the expedient meaning or the definitive meaning in mind.172. Skt. antarvyaparapurusa, Tib. nanggi byed pai skyes bu rtagpa thams cad du khyab pa.173. D3856, fol. 169a. 1-3. Bhaviveka obviously refers in this context to the passages already mentioned from the Lankdvatarasutra about tathagatagarbha and emptiness. Note that the Tarkajvdla (ibid., fol. 50b.3-4) also speaks of tathagatagarbha in its function of en­couraging sentient beings—bodhisattvas having respect even for beings with no quali­ties since they think that these beings will come to possess all qualities in the future due to being endowed with the tathagata heart.174. D3862, fol. 261b.7.175. Since the Madhyamakavatarabhasya explicitly refers to the Lankdvatarasutra in the context of saying that the alaya-consciousness has the meaning of emptiness, one may well assume that Candraklrti also knew about that sutras equation of the tathagata heart with the alaya-consciousness and thus implicitly also asserted the tathagata heart as emptiness.176. D3862, fols. 281a.6-282a.4. This passage consists primarily of Candraklrti’s quotes of the passages from the Lankdvatarasutra about the teachings on the tathagata heart be­ing a means to prevent fear of emptiness and to attract non-Buddhists, concluding that these sutra passages make it clear that all sutras (such as the Samdhinirmocanasutra) that are taken to be of definitive meaning by the Vijnanavadins are of expedient meaning.177. Note that, just as Bhaviveka and Candraklrti, Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra do not explicitly identify the tathagata heart as a nonimplicative negation but speak only of the disposition—the foundation of practice—in Maitreyas Abhisamaydlamkdra"},{"pageNumber":1014,"pageContent":"998 Notes1.37-39 as being the nature of phenomena, suchness, or the dharmadhâtu (which they elsewhere do equate with emptiness, to be realized through Madhyamaka reasoning). Âryavimuktisenas Abhisamayàlamkàravrtti first quotes the Ratnaküta as saying that the disposition of the noble ones is the space-like, unconditioned, and permanent such­ness that is the single taste of all phenomena. Then it explains that the disposition is the nature of phenomena (dharmatà), which may be called “disposition” in the sense of its serving as the cause of the qualities of the noble ones through focusing on it on the path. Haribhadras Abhisamayâlamkârâlokâ says that the notion of disposition only pertains to the level of seeming reality but that there is no disposition ultimately. The actual foundation of practice is nothing but the dharmadhâtu, which may only conven­tionally be said to serve as the cause or bearer of the qualities of the noble ones by vir­tue of being taken as the object of their progressive practice. There is no realization for bodhisattvas unless they train in realizing the buddhadharmas like illusory persons by not clinging to anything as being real. On the level of seeming reality, the dharmadhâtu is glossed as this illusory bodhisattva who is the foundation of the buddhadharmas’ being realized on the various stages of the path. Also, all distinctions of the disposition, such as naturally abiding, unfolding, certain, and uncertain dispositions, or the disposi­tions of éràvakas and pratyekabuddhas, are not tenable ultimately. For it is nothing but the dharmadhâtu’s being taken as the focal object by all practitioners in the three yànas that serves as the cause or foundation for realizing and manifesting the distinct qualities of the noble ones, all of which are expressions of this single ultimate dharmadhâtu. For more details, see Brunnhôlzl 2010, 284 and 790n823.178. Jnânagarbha’s Satyadvayavibhâgavrtti (D3882, fol. 14b.4) explains the dharmakàya (which is equated with emptiness in the sense of cognition, what is cognized, a self, and characteristics being unobservable in verse 39 and its autocommentary) as the body of all dharmas because all beings do not go beyond having the nature of a tathàgata. Eckel (1987, 147) also says about this passage that “the terminology suggests the element of Buddhahood (gotra) that pervades all living beings.” JKC adds here that it is taught that the emptiness that is arrived at through inferential valid cognition is the great disease of bodhisattvas because it represents a great conceptual bondage. Therefore, the third dharma wheel is also more eminent in the sense of entering into nonconceptuality.179. JKC adds that most Indian *Pràsangikas and *Svàtantrikas as well as all Tibetan Rang- tongpas assert emptiness as the nonimplicative negation that is explained in Nàgàrju- na’s “collection of reasoning” and is arrived at through reasoning.180. D3887, fol. 242b.4-7. This text is the first one to incorporate the teaching on tathaga­tagarbha into the Madhyamaka tradition with a more positive meaning. Later, the same is done in Dharmamitra’s (eighth/ninth century) commentary on the Abhisa- mayâlamkàra (quoting the phrase that all beings possess the tathàgata heart from the Adhyardhasatikâprajhâpâramitâsütra).181.

Jayànanda several times equates the tathàgata heart with emptiness and considers the tathàgata heart to be of expedient meaning. Still, he quotes the Uttaratantra as authoritative in establishing that there is only a single yâna. For details, see Kano 2006, 75-79.183. For example, D3903, fol. 150a.6-7.

This sutra does not mention the term “alaya-consciousness,” but its meaning is con­veyed by using the term “the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance.”219.

However, the quote is not found in any of them. Note also that it may be that Tib. degshegs snyingpo yin in this sentence is simply a case of rendering Skt. tathagatagarbhah in the sense of a bahuvrihi compound instead of using the more common de gshegs snying po can, thus meaning, “All sentient beings possess the tathagata heart.” However, it is unlikely that Go Lotsawa, as a Sanskrit expert, would have missed that. Also, as YDC (see appendix 5) attests, there obviously were some people who due to an overly literal reading of certain passages in the tantras, held the five skandhas of sentient beings to be a buddha or the buddha disposition.225.1.48. Uttaratantra 1.47 is even more explicit:Its being impure, its being both impure and pure,And its being completely pure, in due order,Are expressed as “sentient being,”“Bodhisattva,” and “tathagata.”226. Part 2, IV.69.227. This refers to GC s (33.21-25) saying that in the teaching on the factors that unfold the basic element (the ten paramitas) in Dharmadhdtustava 66-68, the disposition is the similarity of a given person s skandhas, faculties, and so on, being made similar to the Buddha himself. Therefore, at that time, those skandhas and so on are the causes of this disposition. When, by virtue of this similarity, that person naturally or auto­matically engages in virtue, this is the sign of that disposition. Thus, the cause is illus­trated by the result. This is said, among others, in the Bodhisattvabhiimi (D4037, fol. 3bl—2): “The sign of the disposition for a bodhisattvas paramita of generosity is that that bodhisattva naturally delights in generosity.”228. 349.

The triad of “basis of intention,” “purpose,” and “invalidation of the explicit state­ment” represents the typical three criteria that the Madhyamaka tradition considers as determining a teaching as being of expedient meaning. See Ruegg 1985, 309-11 and Ruegg 1988.240. Sgra tshad pa rin chen mam rgyal 1971, fol. 23b.2-3.241. For details, see appendix 1 and Brunnholzl 2010, 454-57. Even in China there is an example of someone’s saying that emptiness is the definitive meaning and that the tathagata heart is of expedient meaning since the tathagata heart ultimately is a syn­onym of “emptiness.” The contemporary master Yin Shun (1906-2005) “continually asserts the doctrine of emptiness as the definitive expression of Buddhist truth andrelegates the tathagatagarbha to the category of expedient means For Yinshun, toregard the tathagatagarbha as the ultimate truth rather than as an expedient means can only result in misguided practice and confusion about how to attain enlightenment” (Hurley 2001,11). Otherwise, in China, and in fact in all of East Asia, at least since the eight century the reverse position is generally held (Madhyamaka was eventually sub­sumed under, and reinterpreted by means of, the notion of tathagatagarbha).242. For details, see Hookham 1991a, especially 135ff.; Hopkins 2006 and 2007; Sheehy 2007; Mathes 2008a, 75-91; and Stearns 2010.243.

GC, 14.22-16.17.245. GC supports this by quoting Uttaratantra 1.106b in its Ut (DP) version: “Having seen this honey-like basic element of awareness ...” (rigkhams sbrang rtsi dang ’dra ’di gzigs nas). However, this corresponds neither to the version of this line in RGVV (DP) nor to the Sanskrit of 1.103. Karma Trintepa’s commentary on The Profound Inner Reality also quotes this line as a support for there being a connection between awareness and the basic element, furthermore adding Uttaratantra 1.107c “So the uncontaminated wisdom in living beings is like honey” (see Brunnholzl 2009, 320).246.

Note that the position that both the Madhyamakavatara and the Uttaratantra are Madhyamaka texts goes back at least to the twelfth century to Maja Jangchub Dsondrii (died 1185; Rma bya ba byang chub brtson grus 1975, fol. 4b.6). The contemporary Nyingma and Kagyii master Dzo- gchen Ponlop Rinpoche (born 1965) explains (oral communication, July 24, 2013) that Mipham Rinpoche speaks of two ways in which the two realities are presented: (1) in terms of appearance and emptiness and (2) in terms of the mode of appearance (snang tshul) and the actual mode of being (gnas tshul). In approach (2), seeming reality is defined as “all subjects and objects in which the mode of appearance and the actual mode of being are not in accord” and ultimate reality as “all subjects and objects in which the mode of appearance and the actual mode of being are in accord.” According to the Nyingma tradition, this corresponds to the way in which the two realities are dis­tinguished in the third turning of the wheel of dharma and in the Shentong approach. Specifically, the definition above of ultimate reality refers to the minds of bodhisattvas on the bhumis while being in meditative equipoise and to the minds of buddhas. This means that the qualities of the tathagata heart (such as the four paramitas of supreme purity, bliss, self, and permanence) exist only when the mode of appearance and the actual mode of being are in accord. Therefore, they are established only through “the valid cognition of the pure vision of the noble ones” {’phagspa daggzigs gi tshad ma) but never through “the valid cognition of seeing just this life” (tshur mthong tshad ma).

This seems to be in line with a passage in Rendawa’s latest and most substantial work on the Kalacakratantra that Stearns (2010, 59) points out. After having severely criti­cized the Jonang position on the Kalacakratantra, the Uttaratantra, and the Dharma- dhatustava repeatedly and in detail, Rendawa’s text (Red mda’ ba gzhon nu bio gros 2007, 340-41) describes the difference between self-empty and other-empty as follows: “The presentation of the two realities by the system of this tantra is as follows. All the many phenomena that are the adventitious stains and arise from the condition of mis­takenness due to ignorance represent seeming reality because they obscure the seeing"},{"pageNumber":1019,"pageContent":"Notes 1003of true reality and are the focal objects of what is afflicted. Since they are not established as objects of perfect wisdom they are self-empty, are empty in the sense of extinction, and represent a dead emptiness {hem stong). All the many phenomena of native mind’s luminous nature are ultimate reality. This is not the case by virtue of their being estab­lished as something that withstands analysis through reasoning They are the ulti­mate because they are the sphere of nonconceptuality. They are other-empty because they are devoid of adventitious stains. They are not empty in the sense of extinction, nor do they represent a dead emptiness because they are experienced in the manner ofbeing experienced personally Here, since what is self-empty falls into the extreme ofextinction, its realization is not the correct path to liberation. Rather, what is asserted as the correct path is solely the changeless inner awareness that is experienced in the man­ner of being personally experienced through the power of familiarizing with the oth­er-empty—the luminous true nature of the mind.” For details, see Steams 2010, 55-60.272.

Sakya mchog ldan.278. The following summary is largely based on Komarovski 2006 and 2010.279. For example, Sakya Chogden says that the Mahdparinirvdnasutras presentation of tathdgatagarbha is not of definitive meaning but of expedient meaning. That the Uttaratantra explains the teaching of the tathagata hearts pervading all sentient be­ings as being interpretive and as having a veiled intent (mind’s natural luminosity) is regarded by him as an authoritative view of Alikakaravada (“False Aspectarian”). At least in his later works after 1477, Sakya Chogden classifies Allkakara Yogacara as a subcategory of Madhyamaka, while he treats Satyakara (“Real Aspectarian”) Yogacara as Mere Mentalism. Therefore, it seems safe to argue that whenever a sutra states that tathdgatagarbha pervades all beings, that sutra (or at least that passage in it) should be taken as interpretive or expedient according to Sakya Chogden’s interpretation of Alikakaravada. Note though that his writings do not provide any lists of sutras of de­finitive meaning and expedient meaning in general or within the third dharma wheel (personal communication from Yaroslav Komarovski, October 20,2013).280.

For the position of YDC on the tathagata heart, see appendices 5 and 6.284. This text is now lost, but is quoted in some other preserved Yogacara works, such as in Asanga, Mahaydnasamgraha III. 17.285. According to H. Shiu (Robertson 2008,447), the earliest Chinese work to mention the term “the five texts of Maitreya” and to identify them with these five works seems to be Dunlun’s Yujia lunji (Compendium of the Yogacara Treatises; Taisho vol. 42, 311b). As for the Vajracchedikavyakhya, the Chinese canon contains two commentaries on the Vajracchedikdprajhaparamitasutra (Taisho 1510 and 1511). However, neither of them is ascribed to Maitreya, but they are attributed to Asanga and Vasubandhu, respectively.286.

Tib. Dkarpo mam par ’char ba.298. A similar statement about Dharmapala is found in Sakya mchog ldan 1988b, 220, which is probably the source for TOK here. However, neither the Tengyur nor the Chi­nese canon contain such a text by Dharmapala. In the Chinese canon, there is a com­mentary by him on Aryadevas CatuhSataka (Taisho 1571) that explains that text from a Yogacara perspective.299. This probably means panditas other than Asaiiga (to whom the Tibetan tradi­tion attributes R G W as a separate text) and Vasubandhu (who wrote the Dharma- dharmatavibhagavrtti). By extension, the unavailability of the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatavibhaga in India for some time must have included R G W and the Dharmadharmatavibhagavrtti.300. Maitrlpas dates are quite unclear. BA (842-43) says that he was born in a sheep year or a dog year (identified as 1007 and 1010, respectively, by the translator Roerich) and passed away at seventy-eight (however, Tibetans count the time in the womb as one year, so Maitripa only lived seventy-seven years according to Western counting). The research in Tatz 1987 leads to the similar dating c. 1007-c. 1085, which has been generally repeated. However, based on the biographies of Maitrlpas disciples, Roberts (2011,11) suggests that he died before 1066 when Vajrapani went to Nepal and chooses the dates 986-1063. Maitripa thus would have been born in the dog year that is two twelve-year cycles earlier than the dog year 1010. However, following BA, the sheep year 983-1060 would also be possible. For the implications of these dates for Maitrlpas having met Ati^a and Marpa Lotsawa Chokyi Lodro, see the discussion of Atisa s rela­tionship to Maitripa in the chapter “The Uttaratantra and Mahamudra.” For detailed biographical information about Maitripa, see Tatz 1987 and 1988 as well as Brunnholzl 2007, 125-31.301. ]han2L&T\\m\\\\x&y]hdnasrimitranibandhdvaIiy 432.10-13.302.

For a more detailed list of quotations from the Uttaratantra and R G W in Indian texts, see Kano 2006, 85-86.304. The colophon of IM says that the Uttaratantra was transmitted from Maitripa’s stu­dent *AnandakIrti to both Ratnakarasanti and Sajjana, and Taranatha (1982-1987, 4:485) gives the Shentong lineage as going from *AnandakIrti to Ratnakarasanti and then Sajjana. The colophon of Skyo ston smon lam tshul khrims 2007d presents the lineage of the Dharmadharmatavibhdga as coming from Maitreya to RatnakaraSanti and then Sajjana. Another possibility would be that Maitripa received those two texts from his two teachers.305. Maitreyanatha is not necessarily a name but (as a bahuvrihi compound) can also be an epithet, meaning “the one who has Maitreya as his protector.” Also, the concluding part of IM about the history of its instructions makes it clear that “Maitreyanatha” re­fers to Maitripa. Obviously, this was not uncommon since, as Mathes (2011b, 203n57) points out, the Sekanirdefapanjika by Ramapala, one of Maitripa s main students, also refers to Maitripa (the author of the Sekanirdesa) as Maitreyanatha. See two Sanskrit manuscripts of the text from Cambridge University Library (MS Or. 149, fol. lb.3-4) and St. Petersburg, Gosvdarstvennaja Publicnaja Biblioteka im. M.E. Saltykova-Scced- rina (MS. 283, fol. lb3-4), both saying: ihayam mahdpanditavadhutasrimanmaitreya- nathah... sekanirdeiam kartukdmah.306. Among the fifteen gsan yigs in Kano 2006, 600-606, from the Gelug, Sakya, Kagyii, and Jonang schools, the eleven that treat the transmission of the Uttaratantra and the Dharmadharmatavibhdga separately from the other Maitreya texts (among them the gsan yig of the Fifth Dalai Lama) all agree on this.307. JnanaSri is known to have been active in western Tibet as a teacher-translator, playing an important role in spreading the teachings on valid cognition (pramdna) and the Abhisamayalamkdra. He also composed several texts preserved in the Tengyur (such as commentaries on the Lankdvatarasutra and the Heart Sutra as well as a Pramdnavi n ikayatika).308. ’Ju mi pham rgya mtsho 1984d, 615, and Ngag dbang bio bzang rgya mtsho (Dalai Lama V), Zab pa dang rgya che ba'i dam pai chos kyi thob yig gang ga’i chu rgyun, Col­lected Works (Gangtok, Sikkim: Research Institute of Tibetology, 1991-95), vol. 1, fol. 28a.2.309.

BA (243) also mentions a Mahajana as one of the teachers of Atisa. It is clear that the Putralekha (D4187) was addressed to Sajjana’s son Mahajana (not to another son called Suksmajana). As a letter to a son, PutralekhaIV.18c addresses and admonishes Mahajana by name, advising him to abstain from alcohol.

To make a teaching one’s “death dharma” means that one takes it as the basis for ones practice when dying in order to attain buddhahood, become liberated from samsara, or at least obtain another favorable rebirth.326.

In Fa-tsang’s commentary on this work (Taisho 1838, 63cl4-21), there is a brief account of *Saramati’s life, which Fa-tsang heard from Devaprajna, a monk from Khotan who was the reported translator of the *Dharmadhatvavisesasastra. This ac­count says that *Saramati was a bodhisattva on the first bhumi who was born in India seven hundred years after the passing of the Buddha. He mastered all the teachings of hlnayana and mahayana, but concentrated on teaching the undifferentiated dharma- dhatu. Therefore, he composed texts such as the Ratnagotravibhdga and the *Dharma- dhatvavisesasastra. His works do not deal with provisional dharmas but clarify only the substantial ultimate dharmas (see also Takasaki 1966a, 6-9). Modern scholars consider *Saramati to be someone different than Maitreya or consider “*Saramati” to be one of his epithets.410. For an overview, see Kano 2006, 21.411. CH 0047 in the Stein collection at the India Office (edited in Bailey and Johnston 1935).412. As Shiu (2006, 186) reports, the contemporary scholar Tam Shek-wing believes that the root verses of the Uttaratantra were composed by Maitreya, while additional verses were added by *Saramati. The commentary (RGW), he says, was authored by Asanga, and a final thorough editing of the entire text was done by Maitripa after his rediscov­ery of the work.413. For details, see Inui 1998 and 2000 as well as Matsunaga 1980,187ff.414.

Sutrdlamkaravrttibhasya, D4034, fols. 41b.6-43a.2.426. As for the Sanskrit term srutavasana, sruta can mean “heard,” “listened to,” “taught,” “orally transmitted (knowledge),” and “instruction.” Thus, the term can be understood as “the latent tendencies of or through hearing/listening/studying” or “the latent ten­dencies/or hearing/listening/studying.” The Tibetan rendering thospai bag chags and some of the glosses in the commentaries on the Mahdyanasamgraha seem to suggest the rendering “the latent tendencies of listening,” which can also be understood as covering both options. Therefore, the term may refer to the latent tendencies of having listened to the dharma (which have been planted through having listened) or the latent tenden­cies of being prone to listen to the dharma again at any time in the future. In that way, these latent tendencies are both a result of having listened to the dharma and a cause for further such listening. In addition, the latent tendencies for listening to the dharma in general can also be said to be an innate quality of the dharmadhatu in all sentient beings. Indeed, the Mahdyanasamgraha describes the latent tendencies of listening as having all these meanings. On the one hand, they are said to be a “remedy,” “mundane,” and to increase “by virtue of being associated with listening, reflection, and meditation that are performed many times.” On the other hand, the term refers to “the seeds of the supramundane mind,” “the natural outflow of the pure dharmadhatu,” “the seeds of the dharmakaya,” and they are said to be “included in the dharmakaya.” Therefore, the latent tendencies of listening spring from studying the teachings and make one study them again, thus serving as the causes for eventually attaining the dharmakaya (thus being acquired “latent tendencies of or through listening”). However, since those ten­dencies are also said to be primordially present in the mind stream through the nature of phenomena, they are the natural outflow of the dharmadhatu and are merely re­vived through listening but are not newly created (thus being inherent “latent tenden­cies/or listening”). The Buddhist teachings are seen as the natural outflow or activity of the dharmadhatu upon its being fully realized by a buddha. When these teachings meet with the latent tendencies of listening in the minds of other beings, those tendencies are activated and thus are also called the natural outflow of the dharmadhatu—the na­ture of the mind—of those beings. The comments on these different ways of describing the latent tendencies of listening in the Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisa- mayalamkara (Brunnholzl 2010, 431-33) account for the latent tendencies of listening being said to be both mundane and supramundane, but clearly treat them primarily from an ultimate perspective. The Karmapa says that they are “not something that must be input newly under the influence of conditions” but are “what allows one to listen to all the twelve branches of a buddha’s speech,” “the capacity of uncontaminated cogni­tion that is active through the power of the nature of phenomena,” and they allow “the enlightened activity of the dharmakaya to engage the mind streams of sentient beings.” Also, they do not really increase, but “it is only the power of the decline of the factors to be relinquished that appears as if the latent tendencies of listening, which are the natural outflow of the completely pure dharmadhatu, increase from small to medium and so on.” The meaning of their being “mundane” is explained as referring only to their being the remedy for what is mundane, but in being the natural outflow of the supramundane dharmadhatu, they are not contained in mundane mind streams. The gist of their being a “natural outflow of the dharmadhatu” is said to lie in this terms ad­dressing the need for some factor that is other than the completely pure dharmadhatu itself yet outside of all impure phenomena. Thus, from the perspective of this factor of the natural outflows being associated with a mind stream on the path, it is presented as a bodhisattva and yet also as being included in the dharmakaya. In this way, “in the"},{"pageNumber":1028,"pageContent":"1012 Notessingle body of a yogin that appears as the dependent nature, there are two modes of engagement—the mode of engagement of the continuum of consciousness, and the mode of engagement of the power of wisdom.” Thus, depending on whether the latent tendencies of listening are regarded from the perspective of seeming reality, the path, and ordinary consciousness or from the perspective of ultimate reality, the ground/ fruition, and nonconceptual supramundane wisdom (both perspectives are found in the Mahaydnasamgraha and the Karmapa’s commentary), these tendencies can be described as either mundane, conditioned, and acquired (being a remedy, increasing, and associated with listening, reflection, and meditation) or as supramundane, uncon­ditioned, and innate (being the capacity of uncontaminated cognition that is active through the power of the nature of phenomena, an outflow of the dharmadhatu, and belonging to the dharmakaya). According to the Eighth Karmapa, these tendencies are the spontaneous impulses and habits of listening to, and engaging in, the dharma that are the natural expression of one’s own buddha nature as the causal condition. Thus, the dharma, teachers, and texts’ appearing for oneself as well as one’s being attracted to and engaging them come about through the main cause that consists of the revival of these internal tendencies appearing as if external, with the compassion and the enlight­ened activities of buddhas and bodhisattvas aiding as the dominant or contributing conditions. Fundamentally, all of this happens nowhere else than in the minds of the disciples and as nothing other than appearances in their minds, which in these cases, are increasingly less stained by obscurations.427.

One of the meanings of kula is the residence of a family, that is, as much ground as can be ploughed by two ploughs, each drawn by six bulls.432. The original meaning of this term is bamboo or any other type of cane. Due to the resemblance to the succession of joints in a bamboo cane, the term came to be used in the sense of a pedigree or genealogy, dynasty, lineage race, and family.433. Fol. 14rl-2.434.

As for the meanings of “continuum” that are relevant here, Webster’s Third New In­ternational Dictionary gives the following explanations (which accord quite well with some of the meanings of tantra): “1 : something that is absolutely continuous and selfsame: a : something of which no distinction of content can be affirmed except by reference to something else . . . something of which the only assertable variation is variation in time or space 2 a : something in which a fundamental common character is discernible amidst a series of insensible or indefinite variations < a sensation ~ > b : an identity of substance uniting discrete parts; broadly: CONTINUITY.. 4 a : an ideal substance or medium containing no vacant spaces and devoid of discrete structure b : a continuous portion of a spectrum.” Under “continuity,” we find: “1 ... b : the quality or state of continuing without essential change : uninterrupted persistence of a particular quality or essential with reference to conjoint changing qualities ... c : continuousness in time ... 2: something that shows continuity... 3 : an individual feature, element, or unit of a connected series ...”449. According to GC (8.6-18), the meaning of “treatise” (Skt. sastra, Tib. bstan bcos) should be understood as explained in Sthiramatis Madhyantavibhagatika (Pandeya ed., 1999, 4.7-15; D4032, fol. 190a.4-190b.l): “A treatise consists of the cognizances that appear as the collections of names, words, and letters. Or a treatise consists of the cognizances that appear as the special sounds (or terms) that cause one to attain supra­mundane wisdom. How do cognizances guide one or express [something]? Since the cognizances of the listener arise due to the cognizance of the guide and explainer, there is no flaw. It is a treatise by virtue of correcting [ms] disciples. Since correcting them gives rise to distinct forms of discipline, samadhi, and prajha, they turn away from inappropriate actions and engage in appropriate actions. Or, it is a treatise because it exhibits the characteristics of a treatise. The characteristics of a sastra are that through which one will relinquish the afflictions including their latent tendencies through hav­ing familiarized with all received instructions and that protects [trdya] one from the lower realms and [samsaric] existence, which are frightening due to all kinds of intense, incessant, and long-lasting sufferings. Therefore, it possesses the characteristics of a treatise because it corrects the enemies that are the afflictions and protects one from the lower realms and [samsaric] existence” (for variant readings of this passage in D4032 and Pandeya 1999, see note 1875. This explanation of “treatise” through the two qual­ities of correcting (or mending) and protecting is the one that is generally adopted in Tibetan texts too.450. For example, Maitreya, Madhyantavibhaga I.la, I.4a, and 1.8a.451. For example, Maitreya, Mahdydnasutralamkara IX. 12, IX. 14, IX.43-48 and Maitreya, Dharmadharmatavibhdga (lines 114-15, 288, and 299). Though the precise under­standing of the term “fundamental change” (such as what the “foundation” [asraya] in this term refers to) varies in Yogacara texts, the outcome or result of the fundamen­tal change is frequently identified as the perfect nature, the dharmakaya, buddhahood, or its equivalents being freed from the adventitious stains of dualistic appearances (for a survey, see Brunnholzl 2012b, 52-110). In particular, works such as the Dhar- madharmatavibhaga and its commentary clearly take the “foundation” in “funda­mental change” as nonconceptual wisdom, suchness, or the nature of phenomena, which is freed from adventitious stains. In Uttaratantra V.7, “the foundation” refers"},{"pageNumber":1030,"pageContent":"1014 Notesto the obscured tathagata heart and “its change” to awakening, which is nothing but the tathagata hearts having become unobscured. R G W on I.23ab equates stainless suchness with the final fundamental change of buddhahood, that is, the dharmakáya. R G W on Uttaratantra 1.44 comments that the termination of contaminations or ad­ventitious stains has the characteristic of the completely stainless and pure luminosity of this fundamental change. R G W ’s introduction to the UttaratantraJs second chapter and its comments on II. 1 say that the nature of that fundamental change is the purity of the tathagata heart, while the cause of the fundamental change consists of the two­fold wisdom of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. In addition, R G W s introduction to II.18ff. says that the fundamental change is called “a result of freedom” (from all adventitious stains).452.

In the discussion of the fifth vajra point (awakening) in the Uttaratantra, (1) the na­ture of awakening is said to consist of the purity that is the nature of the fundamental change, which is endowed with all inseparable and stainless buddha qualities and is permanent. The nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise and the wisdom of subsequent attainment are presented as (2) the cause of awakening. The freedom from all afflictive and cognitive obscurations is discussed as a part of (3) fruition.465. Sütrálamkáravrttibhásya (D4034, vol. mi, fol. 134b. 1-5).466.

Furthermore, Grosnick 1979 (91-92) argues that the Uttaratantra's understanding of buddhadhatu as the nonduality of subject and object can be traced back to the Mahay anasutrdlamkara.494. D4061, fol. 30b.3.495. That 1.3 teaches the connection between the seven vajra points is also stated by TOK, 1:461.496. Of course, as R G W on 1.1 explains, there is also the more general purpose of the Uttaratantra’s seven vajra points, which is to elucidate the actuality of realization that is like a vajra because it is to be realized through personally experienced wisdom, has an inexpressible nature, and is difficult to penetrate by studying and reflecting. Having"},{"pageNumber":1032,"pageContent":"ioi6 Noteselucidated this actuality of realization, the ultimate purpose is then to attain the direct realization of this actuality.497. As already mentioned, Mädhyamikas adduce the basis of intention, the purpose, and the invalidation of the explicit statement as the three criteria for a statement’s being of expedient meaning.498. For example, to think of emptiness as referring to the utter nonexistence of everything can lead to depression and faintheartedness in terms of ever attaining buddhahood. Thinking that one has understood emptiness can lead to pride and contempt for those who are perceived as inferior. Due to such pride, true realization will not arise and one will thus continue to cling to what is unreal. To regard even the tathägata heart as completely empty and unreal, just like the adventitious stains, means to misperceive ultimate reality, which is obviously not very conducive for one’s path. Finally, merely through thinking of the tathägata heart and everything else as being nothing but empty, compassion will not arise, which as its reverse only enhances self-cherishing.499. The minor exceptions are the two quotes from the Abhidharmamahäyänasütra.500. Abhisamayälamkära 1.37-39 speaks of “the disposition,” but no Indian commentary relates this to tathägatagarbha. Rather, the disposition is usually taken to be the dhar­madhàtu or the nature of phenomena in the sense of emptiness.501. Limaye 1992,122; D4026, fols. 156b.7-157a.l.502. D4050, fol. 151a.l-2.503. D4051, fols. 230b.7-231a.l.504. Ibid., fol. 246b.4.505. Süträlamkäravrttibhäsya, D4034, fol. 124a.5-124b.2. In its comments on Madhyänta- vibhäga 1.19a (“in order to purify the disposition”), Sthiramati’s Madhyäntavibhägatikä (Pandeya ed., 1999, 45.5-10; D4032, fol. 216a.7-216b.3) explains the meaning of “dis­position” as “primordial nature” (prakrti), which is always like that without beginning and does not arise suddenly, since 1.19a refers to “the emptiness of the primordial na­ture” (one of the sixteen emptinesses). Then, Sthiramati lists some other positions as to what “disposition” means here without commenting on them. Some say that the six (in­ner) äyatanas are the buddha disposition, while others take them to be the disposition of ¿râvakas and so on. Yet others state that “disposition” here means that all sentient beings have the tathägata disposition.506. Obviously, when R G W quotes Mahäyänasüträlamkära IX.37, it understands the terms “suchness” and tathägatagarbha in it in a different way than do Vasubandhu and Sthiramati, that is, as the natural pure luminosity of mind that is only obscured by adventitious stains.507. Keenan 2002, 48, 101, and 103.508. For details on the meaning of “lacking the disposition,” see R G W ’s discussion of the statement in the Mahâparinirvânasütra and others about “those who have the nature of absolutely not attaining parinirväna” (J37).509.

The Chinese canon attributes the text to Vasubandhu (which is highly unlikely) and gives Paramärtha as the translator.513. Further interpreting and expanding on Paramärtha’s approach, the later Chinese schools of Sui and T ang also greatly emphasized the fusion of Yogäcära and tathäga­tagarbha teachings.514. The following overview is based on Diana Y. Paul 1984 and Radich 2008."},{"pageNumber":1033,"pageContent":"Notes 1017515. Note that this is one of the earliest Indian precedents of how Tibetan Shentongpas usually describe the relationship between the three natures. Whereas classic Yogàcàra always says that the perfect nature is the dependent nature empty of the imaginary nature, Shentongpas and several Indian authors state that the perfect nature is empty of both the imaginary and dependent natures. For details on these texts and how they exhibit typical traits of Shentong in terms of their discussions of the three natures and so on, see the section “Indian Forerunners of Shentong, Early Tibetan Shentongpas, and Their Connection to the Uttaratantra” and Brunnholzl 2011a.516. In contrast to Paramàrtha, Hsüan-tsangs (602-664) Yogàcàra approach was primarily based on the teachings by Dharmapàlas (530-561) student Silabhadra (529-645) and the Vijnaptimàtratâsiddhi (attributed to Dharmapàla), which compiles the commentar­ies by ten Indian Yogàcàras on Vasubandhus Vimsatikà and Trimsikà. This approach, which became the predominant Yogàcàra school in China and eclipsed Paramàrtha’s earlier translations and interpretations, does not refer to the notion of tathâgatagarbha at all. In China, unlike India, the teachings on tathâgatagarbha eventually became a school of its own, distinct from both Yogàcàra and Madhyamaka.517. See the chapter “Different Ways of Explaining the Meaning of Tathâgatagarbha” and appendix 2.518. There are some controversies about the authorship of the Satasàhasrikâprajnàpàra- mitâbrhattïkâ (D3807), the Brhattïkâ (D3808), and the Bhagavatyàmnâyânusârinï (D3811). Most Tibetan scholars agree that they are by Damstràsena (eighth century), Vasubandhu, and *Jagaddalanivàsin (twelfth century), respectively. However, D3807 and D3808 were often conflated or both considered to be authored by Damstràsena or other authors, or even to be of Tibetan origin (for details, see Brunnholzl 2010, 692n99 and 2011a, 7-15). If D3807 and D3808 are indeed by Damstràsena and Vasubandhu, they would represent two exceptions before the eleventh century to Yogàcàras usually not combining the teachings on tathâgatagarbha with mainstream Yogàcàra topics and to their not explaining tathâgatagarbha in positive terms.519. D3808, fol. 151a.6. The sentence “all sentient beings possess the tathàgata heart” is also found on fol. 40a. 1.520. Ibid., fol. 63a.5-7.521. Ibid., fol. 187b.4-5. An almost identical passage is found in the Satasâhasrikâprajnà- pàramitâbrhattîkà (D3807, vol. pa, fol. 4a.7-4b.l).522. D3808, fols. 40a. 1-4 and 52a.3-6.523.

For example, Tàranàtha s Essence of Shentong (Tàranàtha 1982-87, 4:501-2) says that the one who elucidated the sütras of the final definitive meaning was Maitreya in his five works, with the Uttaratantra in particular determining the subtle philosophical system of the extraordinary meaning of the sütras on the tathàgata heart. Further­more, Asanga commented on the intention of the Uttaratantra, clearly explaining this extraordinary system in detail. In general, Tàranàtha says, Shentong Madhyamaka is described clearly in all treatises of Asanga and Vasubandhu, but it is extremely lucid and detailed in Vasubandhus Brhattïkâ and Dharmadharmatâvibhàgavrtti."},{"pageNumber":1034,"pageContent":"ioi8 Notes529. In Tibet, almost everybody criticized the Jonang presentation of buddha nature as be­ing like the Hindu view of an àtman, and nowadays some Japanese scholars claim that the notion of tathâgatagarbha is altogether not Buddhist (for overviews, see S. King 1992, R. King 1995, and Swanson 1997).530. These are Mahàyànasütrâlamkàra VI.4, IX.37, XI. 12-13, and XIII.18-19, Madhyàn- tavibhàga 1.1,1.21-22, and III.3, two verses from the Abhidharmamahàyânasütra, and four passages from the Samdhinirmocanasütra.531. This refers to the authors of the Mahàyànasütrâlamkàra, Madhyântavibhàga, Abhidharmamahàyânasütra, and Samdhinirmocanasütra.532. There is no monolithic Shentong School but a great variety of ways in which differ­ent Tibetan masters understand this term and how they formulate the associated view. A text by the twentieth-century Kagyii scholar Surmang Padma Namgyal (Zur mang pad ma rnam rgyal n.d., 60.3-61.6) lists seven different kinds of views held by various Jonang, Sakya, Kagyii, and Nyingma masters on the distinction between rangtong and shentong (I am indebted to Anne Burchardi for drawing my attention to this text and providing me with a copy of it). According to this text, (1) Dolpopa and his follow­ers hold consciousness to be rangtong and wisdom to be shentong. (2) Sâkya Chogden considers phenomena—appearances—as rangtong and the nature of phenomena—lu­minosity—as shentong. (3) Sabsang Mati Panchen maintains subject and object to be rangtong and expanse (dbyings) and wisdom to be shentong. (4) The Thirteenth Kar- mapa considers samsara to be rangtong and nirvana to be shentong. (5) The Eighth Karmapa and his followers take the pure kàyas and wisdom to be rangtong in terms of their actual mode of being and to be shentong in terms of the way they appear. (6) The Eighth Situpa considers the side of negation as rangtong and the side of affirmation as shentong. (7) The Nyingma master Gédsé Panchen from Gahto Monastery (Tib. Kah thog dge rtse pan chen; 1761-1829) regards the phase of conclusive resolve during meditative equipoise to be rangtong and the phase of clearly distinguishing during subsequent attainment to be shentong. Among these seven views, Padma Namgyal ex­plicitly considers views (4), (6), and (7) to be good positions. Summarizing the seven into three, Padma Namgyal says that Dolpopa asserts wisdom to be shentong, Sàkya Chogden holds the expanse to be shentong, and all others take both wisdom and the expanse to be shentong. When summarized into two, the first five are said to present rangtong and shentong mainly by way of what is to be determined, while the latter two do so primarily by way of the means to determine that. Note though (and this complicates matters further) that these seven distinctions are obviously based on three very different categories of comparison in terms of what rangtong and shentong mean. The first—and most common—category takes rangtong and shentong to refer to phe­nomena as belonging to two different levels of reality (seeming and ultimate), which underlies views (l)-(5). The second category refers to rangtong and shentong as two approaches to conceptually determine the subject in question (6). The third category considers rangtong and shentong as distinct (nonconceptual) experiences or phases in the process of attaining realization (7).533. 7.25-8.1534. In this context, this expression could also mean “the actuality of the [tathâgata] heart.”535. Sàkya mchog Idan 1988b, 239-240.536. 1:460-62.537. Tib. Smin gling gter chen ’gyur med rdo rje.538. For example, Lo chen DharmasrI n.d. (373.5-374.5) says: “As for cutting through ref­erence points, there are two [ways]—rangtong and shentong. Rangtong means to assert"},{"pageNumber":1035,"pageContent":"Notes 1019the emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation as the ultimate since [all] subjects in question—no matter how they appear—are empty of a nature of their own right from the point of their mere appearance. As for the Mädhyamikas that determine shentong, due to the difference of asserting all knowable objects as the three characteristics [the imaginary, dependent, and perfect natures] or summarizing them into two—the imagi­nary and the perfect [natures]—there are two dissimilar ways of identifying the subject in question. In the Yogäcära scriptures, the perfect [nature] is explained as the depen­dent (the basis of emptiness) being empty of the imaginary (the object of negation). In the Uttaratantra and so on, it is said that the nature of phenomena—the perfect [nature]—is empty of the imaginary (the object of negation). Therefore, in the essence of this perfect [nature]—the true nature of mind, the ultimate basic element—there are no stains to be eliminated and no previously nonexistent qualities to be newly ac­complished since it is primordially pure by nature and the qualities are spontaneously present.” For further details on Lo chen’s Shentong view and additional excerpts from his text, see Duckworth 2011, 211-12, 307-8, and 315-16.539. GISM (180 and 202) adds the Seventh and Thirteenth Karmapas, the Ninth Situpa, Säkya Chogden, and Täranätha (as well as several Jonang masters after the latter) as proponents of Shentong. Chos grags bstan ’phel (1990, 8) also adds the Ninth ]6 Khenpo of Bhutan, Säkya Rinchen (1710-1759), who is considered to be a reincarna­tion of Säkya Chogden. Säkya Rinchen’s views are mainly presented in a three-volume biography of Säkya Chogden, his poems, and an encyclopedic work on the philosophi­cal systems of Buddhists and non-Buddhists (Rang dang gzhan gyi grub pai mtha’ rgya mtsho Ita bu’ignad bsdus pa legs par bshad pa’i sgo brgya pa in 2:587-830 of his collected works; TBRC W8684).540.14-20.541.

Besides being attributed to Gampopa here in JKC, this statement is attributed to Gam- popa in many texts of later Kagyii masters, such as BA (724), GC (5.10-11), the Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Madhyamakävatära (Mi bskyod rdo rje 1996, 11), and TOK. However, it is not found in the presently available works of Gampopa.546. Tib. ’Bri gung ’jig rten gsum mgon.547.1.158ab/161ab.548.11.38.549. See GISM for the details of Jamgön Kongtrul’s approach of preliminary “Shentong reasoning” and the ensuing cultivation of meditative equipoise in accordance with both the second and third turnings of the wheel of dharma, with the latter’s being based on the essential verses of the Uttaratantra.550. This probably refers to Sakya Pandita. Obviously, JKC attempts here to harmonize the Shentong and Mahämudrä approach (he explicitly equated the two in one passage) even with the essence of the correct view according to one of the most severe Tibetan critics of Shentong-like approaches and Kagyii Mahämudrä.551. Tib. Yu mo ba mi bskyod rdo rje.552. Tib. Gsal sgron skor bzhi. There is little information about Yumowa, but the Jonang School considers him as its founder. Jonang histories of the Kälacakratantra say that"},{"pageNumber":1036,"pageContent":"1020 Noteshe was a student of a certain Candranàtha and a pandita from Kashmir. Yumowa was a master of the Kâlacakratantra and his teachings were initially passed on through his family line and several other masters, with Dolpopa already being about the tenth lineage holder (this tradition only became known as Jonang after the founding of the monastery with that name by Künpang Tugjé Dsôndrü [Tib. Kun spang thugs rje brtson grus; 1243-1313]). Yumowa’s only preserved works are his “Four Lucid Lamps”—“The Lucid Lamp of Union” (Zung ’jug gsal sgron), “The Lucid Lamp of Mahâmudrâ” (Phyag rgya chen po’i gsal sgron), “The Lucid Lamp of Luminosity” (’Od gsal gsal sgron), and “The Lucid Lamp of Emptiness” (Stong nyid gsal ba’i sgron me). These texts deal with the correct practice of the six-branch yoga of the Kâlacakratantra and treat some of the topics on which Dolpopa elaborated later (without, however, using his specific terminologies, such as rangtong, shentong, and âlaya-wisdom; for more details, see Stearns 2010,43-45). Thus, Târanàtha s History of the Kâlacakratantra says that Yumowa is “the founder of the philosophical system of mantric Shentong” (Târanàtha 1982-87, 2:16). It is obviously due to Jamgon Kongtruls general great reli­ance on Târanàtha that he also mentions Yumowa here in connection with Shentong.553. The term dbyings (“expanse”) is one of the two Tibetan words for the Sanskrit term dhâtu in the sense of dharmadhâtu. It emphasizes the unlimited and all-pervasive space-like quality of the dharmadhâtu (here not understood as mere emptiness but as the union of emptiness and clarity or nondual nonconceptual wisdom), while the word khams (“basic element”) emphasizes that this dharmadhâtu is the innate true nature of the minds of all sentient beings.554. Shes rab phun tshogs 2007, 9.555. Note also that Rongtôn’s very brief and rather generic Stages of Meditation on the “Uttaratantra” (Rong ston shes bya kun gzigs 1999, 529) explicitly states that there is a meditative tradition of practicing the contents of the Uttaratantra, saying that he pres­ents the manner of making the Uttaratantra a living experience by summarizing the meaning that is explained in Nàropa’s pith instructions (though Rongton s text contains no details on this).556. When I refer to the Third Karmapas view as “Shentong,” I do so because of certain features of that view. The Karmapa’s own texts never use the terms shentong or rang­tong and labeling his view as Shentong by no means implies that it is the same as Dôlpo- pa’s (for the major differences between them, see Brunnhôlzl 2009, 114-17).557. See Brunnhôlzl 2007b, 159-93, and 2009.558. Karma phrin las pa phyogs las rnam rgyal 2006, 396-97.559. Karma phrin las pa phyogs las rnam rgyal 1975, vol. cha, 90-92.560. Karma phrin las pa phyogs las rnam rgyal (2006,46-47) explains this further: “Others say, ‘If this heart had the sixty-four qualities from the very beginning, the qualities of perfect buddhahood would exist in the mind streams of sentient beings, and in that case, does the buddha wisdom in the mind stream of a hell being experience the suffer­ings of hell?’ Such is indeed said, but it is precisely for this reason that we speak about [wisdom or luminous mind] by making the distinction that it is stained during the phase of sentient beings and stainless in the state of a buddha. In other words, perfect buddhahood and its powers and so on do not exist in the mind streams of sentient beings. This is definitely how it is, but it will be understood through saying again and again, ‘Stained buddhahood and its powers and so on exist [in their mind streams].’”561.

For 250 years (mid-fifteenth to late seventeenth centuries) before the ban of the Jonang School in Central Tibet, the Jonang School had already flourished in Amdo and continues to do so to the present day—groups of monasteries in Dzamtang, Golog, Gyalrong, and Ngawa in far eastern Tibet are the only places where the Jonang tradition survived in Tibet to the present day. According to Ngawang Lodrô Tragpa, Ngawang Trinlé’s disciple Ngawang Tendzin Namgyal (Tib. Ngag dbang bstan ’dzin rnam rgyal; 1691-1738) was the first native person from Amdo to be the throne holder of Tsangwa Monastery. Following him, there were six successors before Bamda Tubten Gele Gyatso (Tib. ’Bam da* thub bstan dge legs rgya mtsho; 1844-1904), the primary student of"},{"pageNumber":1038,"pageContent":"1022 NotesNgawang Chöpel Gyatso (Tib.

He also held the Dzogchen lineage of Dzogchen Monastery, studied closely with Jamgön Kongtrul and Patrul Rinpoche (Tib. Rdza dpal sprul rin po ehe; 1808-1887), and even had mu­tual teacher-student relationships with several Gelugpa teachers—the fourth Jamyang Shéba (Tib. ’Jam dbyang bzhed pa; 1856-1916), Kesang Goshri (Tib.

As its title says, this text is an overview of all Buddhist teachings but in particular elucidates the intention of the Eighth Karmapa (the main teacher of Balkang Lotsàwa). It appears that TOK (not the root text but the commentary) incorporates almost this entire text in more or less literal form. It will be one of my future projects to translate this work and compare it with TOK. Given that it is already well known that TOK incorporates a substantial number of passages from Täranätha s and Šákya Chogden’s works, its com­parison with Karma Trinlépa’s text will shed even more light on the process through which TOK was compiled.601. Note that the Shangpa Kagyii tradition, despite its name and certain similarities in its teachings, is an independent school and not a subschool of the Kagyii School. This is clear from the Shangpa School’s having a completely different lineage and its own set of"},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"Notes 1023transmitted teachings. Its status as a distinct tradition is also outlined in the presenta­tion of “the eight great chariots of practice lineages” (Tib. sgrub brgyud shing rta chen po brgyad) in Tibet.602.

For these connections, see appendix 2 and the descriptions and translations of IM, RW, and HML in this volume.604. Compare RGW (J26.9) on Uttaratantra 1.28.605. Interestingly, prasâdhana is glossed as “having the nature of direct perception” (pratyaksarüpam), which accords with GC’s and JKC’s above-mentioned approach to the Uttaratantra through the path of direct perception.606. This refers to the parts of the following syllogism: “The afflictiveness of afflictions, karma, and birth (subject) is empty (predicate of the probandum) because it is condi­tioned (reason), just like clouds, dreams, and illusions (example).”607. This refers to the following passage in R G W (J33.10-11): “For as long as they do not perceive the tathâgata element, which becomes apparent due to the cessation of all afflictiveness in terms of afflictions, karma, and birth without exception ...”608.

Note that this last sentence distinguishes between prajnà and wisdom, obviously in the sense of the formers referring to the analytical insight into the utter emptiness of the adventitious stains, while the latter means the direct and nonconceptual realization of the tathâgata heart with its inseparable qualities. Evidently, these two are comple­mentary, but nonconceptual wisdom can arise only once the adventitious stains are seen through.615.81.616. Kun dga’ grol mchog 1981, 170-71.

For example, Mahâyânasamgraha III.8 says that the imaginary nature corresponds to the snake; the dependent nature, to the rope; and the perfect nature, to just the charac­teristics of color, smell, taste, and what can be touched that make up a rope. By contrast, the Third Karmapa’s commentary on the Dharmadharmatâvibhâga (Rang byung rdo rje 2006b, 497) explains that the imaginary nature is like the snake for which the rope is mistaken, that is, a nonexistent that nevertheless seems to appear. Just as the rope, the dependent nature appears, but is not really existent in the way it appears as a rope, since all that appears is a mere collection of threads with a certain color and shape. The perfect nature is the snake’s and the ropes very own nature of lacking any real existence as well as unmistaken self-awareness, since it is without being mistaken about what appears.618.

As already mentioned, in the “Maitreya Chapter” in the prajfiäpäramitä sütras in eigh­teen thousand and twenty-five thousand lines, all phenomena are divided into three kinds—“imaginary form,” “conceived form,” and “dharmatä-form” and so on—which correspond to the three natures.620. 29.621.464.622. 29.623. 150-51.624. 194.625. 348.626.

Note that, beginning with this sentence, this passage incorporates most of what Gö Lotsäwa’s BA (724-25) says at the end of its presenta­tion of the Kagyü lineage. In general, this section of TOK incorporates parts of BA, GC, and the Eighth Situpa’s commentary on the Third Karmapa’s Aspiration Prayer of Mahämudrä.635. Tib. lhan cigskyes sbyor. This expression seems not to be attested in Indian texts, while terms such as sahajänanda, sahajasukha, sahajakäya, sahajacitta, and sahajajnäna are frequently used, particularly in the dohäs. The Sanskrit sahaja (lit. “born together”) means “innate,” “connate,” “original,” “natural” but also “always the same as at the very beginning.” It appears that the particular term “connate union” was coined by Gampopa. On its meaning, Jamgön Kongtrul (Kong sprul bio gros mtha* yas 1979-81, 18:431) quotes Gampopa as saying:The three of mind, thoughts, and dharmakâya Are [already] connate in the first place.Since they are united into one through the instructions,Isn’t that called connate union?Gampopas Pith Instructions on the Two Armors (Tib. Go cha gnyis kyi man ngag; Mi pham chos kyi bio gros 1997, 4:509) explains, “As for connate union, what arises and is unified? It is awareness and emptiness that are connate. In themselves, they are not like something that is different. Since awareness, lucidity, and bliss are unified with emptiness they are connate union.” A virtually identical version of the above verse is attributed to Pamo Trupa in the Ninth Karmapas Ocean of Definitive Meaning (Wangchuk Dorje 2001, 278). The same author (ibid., 273-77 and 279) quotes several explanations of the term “connate union.” Following Gampopas above explanation, the Second Shamarpa, Kachö Wangpo (Tib. Mkha’ spyod dbang po; 1350-1405) is re­ported to say that “con-” in “connate” refers to arising or occurring together, while “-nate” means that everything arises from what is unarisen and that it, from the very"},{"pageNumber":1041,"pageContent":"Notes 1025moment of its arising, lacks any nature of its own. “Union” (sbyor ba) means yoga (Tib. mal ’byor, lit. “being in union with the natural state”). Yoga is not just means or prajna alone, but the Buddha taught that it is the union of means and prajna. Barawa Gyaltsen Balsang (Tib. ’Ba’ ra ba rgyal mtshan dpal bzang; 1310-1391) is quoted as saying that “connate” does not mean that two things come together but that an entity with a single nature has three qualities or aspects that always exist or arise together. For example, the single nature of gold entails the three properties of having a golden color, being heavy, and not being affected by melting or cutting. In gold, each of these qualities is not something separate from the other two. As long as there is gold, those three are always present or arise together. Likewise (and similar to what Gampopa explained above), the triad of the essence of awareness, the nature of emptiness, and the characteristic of lucidity is connate with the ultimate bodhicitta of the ground (the true nature of the mind). There is no awareness and lucidity apart from emptiness, no emptiness and lucidity apart from awareness, and no emptiness and awareness apart from lucidity. The mind is of a single nature with three aspects or isolates: emptiness, awareness, and lucidity. Experientially, those three do arise, but they are inseparable. Thus, they are connate—emptiness arises as awareness and lucidity, awareness arises as emptiness and lucidity, and lucidity arises as emptiness and awareness. Within each one of them, all three arise or are present in a complete manner. Therefore, they are connate. To unite this connateness with ones mind stream is called “connate union.” This connateness is present within buddhas down to the tiniest insects, without being better or worse, big­ger or smaller. When its own face is recognized, it is called “connate wisdom.” When it is not recognized, it is called “âlaya-consciousness” or “connate ignorance.” There is no distinction between this wisdom and ignorance in terms of ones coming first and the other later, nor in terms of being good or bad because both are of the same nature. As for the difference between Mahâmudrâ and Connate Union, Wangchuk Dorje says that Gampopa told Pamo Trupa, “Mahâmudrâ means that all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are spontaneously present primordially. It is the space-like nature of phenom­ena, nondual wisdom present at all times. Connate union refers to unifying whatever thoughts that arise with the four kàyas. Therefore, it is not held to be present at all times, but its flow becomes interrupted sometimes.” Lama Shang says:The wisdom of connate unionBreaks down thoughts and brings them back into the dharmakàya.The pith instructions of MahâmudrâRelax thoughts and bring them back into the dharmakàya.For Padma Karpo s explanation of “connate union” by greatly relying on the Uttaratan­tra, see the section “Padma Karpo.” For Tagpo Dashi Namgyals explanation of “con­nateness,” see Takpo Tashi Namgyal 1986, 220-25.636.

There is no known text by Atisa called Pith Instructions on the Two Armors of Con­nate Union Mahâmudrâ (TOK “second armor” [Tib. go cha gnyis pa] is emended in light of the Tibetan text names below), but it could have been lost. Also, it is not clear here whether this is the name of an actual text or just a subsequent name for certain pith instructions originating with Atisa (such as on his Bodhipathapradipa; see the next paragraph in TOK). The latter may be suggested by the fact that there are texts with similar names by Gampopa and Pamo Trupa. The collected works of the latter contain a work titled The Two Armors of Connate Union Mahâmudrâ (Tib. Lhan cig skyes sbyor go cha gnyis ma; Phag mo gru pa rdo rje rgyal po 2003, 4:294-304). The text contains no reference to Atisa but says that its instructions are about taking thoughts as the path (rnam rtog lam khyer) and realizing them to be without arising. These instructions are not tainted by the yâna of characteristics (sütrayàna) and require no efforts in training in the stages of the paths of the three kinds of individuals (of lesser, intermediate, and supreme scopes). Thoughts are also said to be very kind, but there is no discussion of the four yogas of Mahâmudrâ. Elsewhere, Pamo Trupa (ibid., 4:570f.) says that the two armors are the armor of prajnà and the armor of the view and that the practice of “tak­ing thoughts as the path” is a part of the armor of prajnà since this practice enhances prajnà. Gampopa s Pith Instructions on the Two Armors (Tib. Go cha gnyis kyi man ngag in Mi pham chos kyi bio gros 1997,4:502-67) is also a text on Mahâmudrâ (for details, see the section on Gampopa in this volume). The same author’s The Two Armors of Mahâmudrâ (Tib. Phyag rgya chen po’i go cha gnyis; A mgon rin po che 2004,11:95-98) does not discuss Mahâmudrâ but is a general text on prerequisites for retreat.648. Mi bskyod rdo rje 1976, fol. 279a.2-5. The text continues, “which are known as Geshé [Dromjtonpa’s and Geshé Gônpapa’s ‘Connate Union.’”649. TOK, 3:378-79. The primary reason why this Mahâmudrâ approach accords with the mantra system lies in the role and significance of the guru, as it is reflected in the crucial importance of guru devotion and guru yoga, as well as in the necessity of di­rect pointing-out instructions of the nature of the mind by the guru (whose ultimate manifestation consists of the formless “empowerment of vajra wisdom” for the most suitable students).650. Among these three features in due order, Sahajavajra mentions the first two at the be­ginning of his commentary and the third one later (P3099, fols. 176a.5, 189a.3,190a.5, and 192b.l; see Brunnhôlzl 2007a, 142, 174, 177, and 183). Thus, this passage is not an actual quote from Sahajavajras commentary. The sentence here is almost literally found in the Tibetan of Gô Lotsàwa’s BA (’Gos lo tsà ba gzhon nu dpal 2003a, 2:847-48, which is followed by “Therefore, the prajnàpàramità Mahâmudrâ of lord Gampopa was explained by lord Gôtsangpa as being the position of the mighty lord Maitrlpa”). How­ever, in the English translation of this text (BA, 725), this sentence is misrepresented as a direct quote in slightly different form. GC also repeats this sentence several times, relating it to both Sahajavajra (17.7-9, 137.15-23) and Padampa Sangye’s Pacification of Suffering (5.18-9; 53.2-4)."},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"Notes 102 7651.

These are two lines from a famous verse, which (according to TOK and Dpal Idan rang byung phrin las kun khyab bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan n.d., 19) stems from The Tantra of Inconceivable Connateness:Connate mind as such is the dharmakaya.Connate thoughts are the display of the dharmakaya.Connate appearances are the light of the dharmakaya.The inseparability of appearances and mind is connateness.More or less literal versions or lines of this verse are found in a number of Gampopa’s own works and those by others.

In due order, these refer to the four common preliminaries of Mahamudra (reflect­ing on the precious human existence, impermanence, karma, and the shortcomings of samsara) and the four uncommon preliminaries (refuge and bodhicitta, Vajrasattva meditation, mandala offering, and guru yoga).656. These are the first two of the four dharmas of Gampopa, with the other two (the path’s dispelling delusion and delusion dawning as wisdom) following under (2).657. To my knowledge, no tantra of this name is preserved in the Kangyur or otherwise.658.1 add this line as it appears in the quote from The Tantra of Inconceivable Connatenesssince TOK comments on this line under 2b.659. In the context of explaining “the means of purification, the great vajra yoga of Mahamudra,” Dpal Idan rang byung phrin las kun khyab bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan (n.d., 18-20) gives a similar (but more detailed) presentation, agreeing that the common and uncommon preliminaries of Mahamudra correspond to “the mind’s turning into the dharma” and “the dharmas turning into the path,” respectively. The next two dharmas of “the path’s dispelling delusion” and “delusion’s dawning as wisdom” are then dis­cussed through explaining the four lines from The Tantra of Inconceivable Connateness as follows, (a) The line “Connate mind as such is the dharmakaya” refers to the basic nature of mind as such, which is the union of being empty and lucid. To realize this just as it is, one needs to first train in calm abiding with support, without support, and so on, until one finally arrives at natural calm abiding. Having gone through the progressive training in calm abiding, one needs to train in superior insight, which has three parts— identifying, pointing out, and enhancement. Finally, one needs to practice calm abid­ing and superior insight simultaneously without separating them. Through practicing this progression well, the path is able to dispel delusion, (b) Thereafter, the distinctive feature of the path of not relinquishing delusion but its fundamentally changing into"},{"pageNumber":1044,"pageContent":"1028 Noteswisdom through special methods is indicated by the line “connate thoughts are the display of the dharmakaya.” At present, all kinds of good and bad thoughts appear in our mind stream. Their essence is the union of being empty and lucid, and through realizing that, all these various thoughts are nothing but the display or play of the lumi­nous dharmakaya or wisdom. Other than that, this display is not established as having any characteristics of being something to be adopted or something to be discarded by distinguishing its parts that are good and those that are bad. Through considering good thoughts within this basic nature as qualities, one wishes to adopt them. Through considering bad thoughts as flaws, one wishes to discard them. However, no matter which thoughts come up, they are all flaws. For all good and bad thoughts do not exist as something other than the mind of dharmatá and they do not go beyond the expanse of this mind. No matter how one wanders around in samsáric states under the extrin­sic influence of karma and afflictions, if one realizes the way things are through the power of the path of yoga, thoughts will be self-liberated without needing to search for a remedy. Yogins who possess such supreme realization recognize all thoughts that appear as the display of dharmatá. Through that, all thoughts that appear dawn as the dharmakaya or serve as aids for the yogic path. Just as a small fire can be extinguished by even a little bit of wind, in ordinary persons who have not mastered the basic na­ture, even small thoughts obscure the path. When a powerful fire has broken out in a forest, the stronger the wind blows, the more it becomes a special aid for that forest fire. Likewise, in yogins who have mastered experience and realization or who have cut through doubts in their minds, the more thoughts there are, the more they become an enhancement of their practice. Therefore, if one knows the nature of thoughts with­out error, whatever appears becomes an embellishment of the path. For example, no matter how far a crow may circle away from a ship on the ocean, there is no place for it to land other than that ship. Likewise, no matter how much thoughts may proliferate, if one knows how they are the display and play of the nature of phenomena, those thoughts are recognized and thus liberated as the nature of phenomena. In the same way, though water may become ice due to outer conditions such as its being cold, once it becomes free from those conditions, it melts again into water because that very ice has primordially never gone beyond having the nature of water. Likewise, no matter how much one is deluded due to being distracted, by virtue of perfectly realizing the nature of thoughts, it is said that thoughts are liberated as the nature of phenomena because they have primordially never gone beyond the nature of phenomena, (c) As for the line “Connate appearances are the light of the dharmakaya,” no matter how the various appearances of samsara and nirvana may arise, the nature of what arises is being empty and lucid without meeting and parting. Therefore, the various appearances that arise as such are not established as something distinct from that nature of phenomena. When they arise, they arise from the expanse of the nature of phenomena, and when they dissolve, they dissolve into the expanse of the nature of phenomena. Therefore, they are the light of the dharmakaya. (d) As for the line “The inseparability of appearances and mind is the connate,” it needs to be understood that the inseparability of mind’s self-appearances and mind as such entails the key point of self-arising and self-liberat­ing. This is explained as the quality of their being connate without meeting and parting from the very time of arising. This explains the manner of delusion’s dawning as, or fundamentally changing into, wisdom. Without relinquishing delusion but through de­termining its very way of being, it is recognized for what it is and one rests right within that. Thus, delusion’s not being relinquished is liberated as the nature of phenomena."},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"Notes 1029All this explains the meaning of the line “the means of purification, the great vajra yoga of Mahâmudrâ.”660. In other words, these four pitfalls to be avoided in Mahâmudrâ meditation are as follows. (1) One can deviate from emptiness through grasping at it as being the fun­damental nature of all knowable objects. Though all phenomena are naturally empty, when one fixates on the notion of everything’s being empty, one deviates from empti­ness as the fundamental ground that is beyond all grasping and fixation. (2) One can deviate from emptiness through considering meditating on emptiness as the sole path that leads to the attainment of buddhahood. To familiarize with emptiness is a crucial part of the path, but this does not mean to discard the accumulation of merit and the purification of obscurations on the path. (3) One can deviate from emptiness through taking it as the remedy that annihilates the afflictions. Ultimately, to fixate on what is to be abandoned and to fixate on the remedy are equally mistaken. If one fixates on emp­tiness as a remedy, it is no better than fixating on whatever it is that one is trying to get rid of by applying that remedy of emptiness. For one then reifies emptiness into some kind of thing, for which one would need yet another remedy. (4) One can deviate from emptiness through conceptually labeling all things and experiences as being empty. This means to lack a full understanding of emptiness and merely think in a vague and general way, “All phenomena are empty.”661. That is, through clinging to bliss, clarity, and nonthought, one will be reborn in the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm, respectively.662. This refers to the four joys in the practice of karmamudrâ—joy, supreme joy, special joy (or joy beyond joy), and connate joy.663. Compare to Maitripa’s student Ràmapàla, who writes in his Sekanirdesapanjikâ that Mahâmudrâ is beyond the four joys.664. “The three great ones” refers to the three primary afflictions—ignorance, desire, and hatred.665.

This samàdhi is described in detail in Abhisamayâlamkâra V.24-25 and its commen­taries (see Brunnhôlzl 201 lb, 93, 246-65, and 298-302 and 2012a, 337-39 and 512-13).667. This samàdhi is described in the Mâyopamâsamâdhisütra (D130).668. This samàdhi is described in the Süratngamasamàdhisütra (D132; translated as Süramgamasamâdhisütra: The Concentration of Heroic Progress, translated by S. Boin-Webb (London: Curzon Press, 1998).669. This samàdhi is described in the Abhisamayâlamkâra (particularly in chapter 7), its commentaries, and other sources (see Brunnhôlzl 2011b, 105-8 and 272-76 and 2012a, 358-60 and 522-24).670. According to the Ninth Karmapa (Wangchuk Dorje 2001, 226-45), there are many ways in which different masters correlate the four yogas of Mahâmudrâ with the five paths and the ten bhümis. However, the most common one is that in due order, the four yogas correspond to the paths of accumulation and preparation, the path of seeing (the first bhümi), the path of familiarization (the remaining nine bhümis), and the path of nonlearning (the buddhabhümi).671. See GC’s presentation of this below.672. Tib. Spyan Inga chos kyi grags pa. This is the Fourth Shamarpa (1453-1524).673. Pawo Rinpoche’s History of the Dharma (Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phreng ba 2003, 1:790- 91) says on this dream that Gampopa was beating a great drum in the sky and then a woman with a bowl of milk appeared, who said to him, “Beat the drum for these people, and give the milk to these deer.” Gampopa answered, “But the milk will not be enough"},{"pageNumber":1046,"pageContent":"1030 Notesfor that many deer.” The woman said, “First drink from it yourself, and then it will be enough for all sentient beings. I will go the west.” Later, Gampopa said, “The people listening to the sound of the drum are those to be nourished by the Kadampa dharma, while the deer are the great meditators of the Kagyii lineage [of Milarepa]. Thus, the Kadam [lineage] also has great kindness.”674. These are the five degenerations in terms of (1) life span (the human life spans be­coming increasingly shorter down to being only ten years), (2) afflictions (their increase in strength and number), (3) sentient beings (deterioration of their physical forms, minds, and health), (4) the time (being tormented by diseases, weapons, and famines), and (5) the view (clinging to views about extremes and falling away from the correct view). (2) is also explained as the decrease of virtuous states of mind in lay people, paired with a strong increase of their desire, hatred, jealousy, miserliness, and so on, while (4) refers to clinging to the extremes of permanence and extinction in renunci- ates, paired with a general decline of their proper views and virtues.675. These are individuals of lesser scope who engage in the Buddhist teachings only for the sake of attaining a better rebirth within samsara as humans or gods, individuals of intermediate scope who do so for the sake of attaining their own liberation from samsara (sravaka or pratyekabuddha arhathood), and individuals of supreme scope who do so for the sake of attaining buddhahood for the welfare of others.676. The Ninth Karmapas Ocean of Definitive Meaning (Wangchuk Dorje 2001, 4-5) agrees with this, saying that dull faculties can change into sharp ones; low potentials, into supreme ones; and unworthy recipients, into worthy ones. Therefore, all of these types should engage in the preliminary practices for the gradual instructions, through which they will become fortunate persons in whose mind streams the actual practice will develop. The preliminaries are either long and indirect or short and direct. Accord­ing to AtiSa, the Karmapa says, the former consists of the paths of individuals with lesser and intermediate scopes, while the latter is the path of individuals with supreme scope. In accordance with that, Gampopa taught his famous four dharmas, each of which must precede the following one.677. This refers to Taranatha.678. TOK, 3:381-88. According to Khenpo Tsiiltrim Gyatso Rinpoche, the three appear­ances of the Sakya tradition of The Path with the Result (Tib. lam ’bras) refer to impure appearances (without any analysis, appearances are taken to be real), the appearances of yogic experience (due to some analysis of ultimate reality, appearances are experi­enced as illusory), and the pure appearances of a buddha (due to thorough analysis of ultimate reality, appearances are realized as having the nature of space). These teach­ings represent the connection between the sutra system and the Hevajra system in the Sakya School.679. Usually, the last of the four tantra classes is called “Anuttarayogatantra” in modern writings, but this term is not attested in any Sanskrit texts and is based on a (mistaken) back-translation of the Tibetan term rnal ’byor bla med kyi rgyud. In Sanskrit texts, only the corresponding terms Yogdnuttara or Yoganiruttara (“higher than yoga[tan- tra]”) appear.680. 3:388-89.681. On these “empty forms,” see the note on the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects in the translation of RG W on 1.92 and GISM (198).682. TOK has “view of’ instead of “clinging to.”683.

Dpal Idan rang byung phrin las kun khyab bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan (n.d., 21) says that in our uncommon tradition of Gampopa, what is known as “the empowerment of transferring blessings” is sufficient for those of very sharp faculties, even if they have not trained in the stages of the four empowerments, the two stages of creation and completion, and so on. It is said that the swift path is to meditate on the guru, which is more powerful than cultivating the creation stage of secret mantra. The completion stage means that through sustaining the luminous basic nature of the mind throughout the day and night, one is able to blend all coarse and subtle ordinary activities with that basic nature. “The empowerment of transferring blessings” is known as “the em­powerment of the display of basic awareness (rig pa)” in the Dzogchen tradition and is equivalent to it. Based on the four empowerments in the Yogânuttaratantra class, in due order, the inseparabilities of appearance and emptiness, lucidity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and awareness and emptiness are pointed out. This is identified as what is taught in terms of those whose faculties are of the gradualist kind. However, for the simultaneists on the path of Mahâmudrâ, it is not necessarily the case that this path must be preceded by these progressive stages. To speak directly, when a guru with all the defining characteristics and a disciple who is a suitable vessel meet, the way of being of mind is introduced in an unerring manner just as it is. If it is recognized in the proper manner, the disciple does not need to train in a multitude of methods in this physical support but can be liberated right upon this very seat.687. Tib.

For a"},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"1032 Notesdetailed chart of the Tibetan and Sanskrit versions, see Mikkyô-seiten kenkyükai 1988,228. For a classification in terms of contents, see Padma dkar po 2005, 37-42; see also Broido 1987, 55-57. Most of these texts give Advayavajra as their author (a few have Metri), but it is well known from many sources that Maitrlpa was also called Adva- yavajra(pàda), Avadhüta, and Acinta(pàda), and Butôn explicitly ascribes all of these works to Maitrlpa. However, the topic of these works is not only “mental nonengage­ment,” but they also treat a great variety of subjects pertaining to the mahâyàna and vajrayàna, in particular Madhyamaka. However, in Tibet, that whole set of Maitripa’s works received the name “the cycle on mental nonengagement” since traditionally the notion of mental nonengagement is the one that is primarily associated with his teach­ings (for details on that term, see below in this section). For a biographical sketch of Maitrlpa, see Tatz 1987 and Brunnholzl 2007a, 125-31.700. This is why the later threefold Tibetan division of Mahâmudrâ into sütra Mahâmudrâ, tantra Mahâmudrâ, and essence Mahâmudrâ classifies Maitrlpa’s system as sütra Mahâmudrâ. The same goes for Gampopa’s Mahâmudrâ, whose similar approach is based on Maitripa’s.701. These are his Tattvavimsikâ, Upadeiaparama, Sekanirdesa (verses 26,27,29,36,38,39), Samksiptasekaprakriyà (P3089, fol. 142b.3), and Caturmudràniécaya (Mikkyô-seiten kenkyükai 1989, 253, 249, 243, 239), with the latter three treating specifically tantric topics. Verse 11 of the Tattvavimsikâ says, “Again, yogins who see true reality merge with Mahâmudrâ in an unmatched way. Through the nature of all entities, they abide as those with supreme faculties.” Verses 4-5 of the Upadesaparama read, “Since cause and result are inseparable, I have no stages of meditation. Through experiencing the flavor of emptiness, meditation is realization. Through the cultivation of prajnà, ev­erything is Mahâmudrâ. Therefore, even in adverse factors, true reality is Mahâmudrâ, the relaxed unthinkable nature.” Sekanirdeêa 29 and 38 state that not abiding anywhere is known as “Mahâmudrâ” and that Mahâmudrâ is freedom from characteristics. As for explanations on Mahâmudrâ in the three commentaries on Saraha’s Dohakosagïti (tlPeople Doha”) that are ascribed to Advayavajra/Advaya Avadhüti (D2256, D2257, D2268), further detailed study is needed. At least D2268 largely follows Saraha’s pre­sentation of Mahâmudrâ in his Kâyakosâmrtavajragïti (D2269) through the four key terms “mindfulness” (dran pa), “nonmindfulness” (dran med), “unborn” (skye med), and “beyond mind” (bio ’das). Unlike Maitrlpa, Sarahas songs often bitingly reject all other views and practices—Buddhist as well as non-Buddhist—including Madhyamaka and elaborate vajrayàna practices (see the opening verses of his “People Doha”). In that vein, Saraha’s Kâyakoûâmrtavajragïti (P3115, fol. 78a) says that the Vaibhàsikas, the Sautràntikas, the Yogàcâras, and the Màdhyamikas just criticize and debate each other. Not knowing the space-like true reality of appearance and emptiness, they turn their back on connateness.702. Maitripa’s Amanasikârâdhâra (Mikkyô-seiten kenkyükai 1989, 209) ascribes this quote to the Sarvabuddhavisayâvatârajnânâlokâlamkârasütra, but it is not found there. However, the prajnàpàramità sütras repeatedly say that actual virtue is mental nonen­gagement, while nonvirtue is mental engagement.703. D100,fol. 299b.6-7.704. Mikkyô-seiten kenkyükai 1989, 243 (D2225, fois. 78b.5-79a.l; the words in paren­theses are only found in the Tibetan).

D2259, fols. 305a.5-307a.3."},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"Notes 1033706. It seems noteworthy to point out that the term “mahâmudrâ” in Buddhist tantric texts does not only refer to (1) the highest one among the four mudràs. In the Bud­dhist tantras, “mahâmudrâ” is also found as (2) an equivalent of all terms that denote ultimate reality (such as emptiness, tathâgatagarbha, buddhahood, and dharmakâya), (3) a term for symbolic hand-gestures in tantric rituals, (4) the main female consort of the central male deity in a given mandala of tantric deities, (5) a consort in sexual yoga practices, (6) a meditation approach of directly focusing on the nature of the mind, (7) the wisdom of realizing the union of bliss and emptiness, (8) the supreme siddhi that consists of perfect buddhahood as the final culmination of tantric practice, (9) a lineage of teachings through a series of Indian masters including Saraha, Nâgârjuna, Tilopa, Nàropa, and Maitripa, and (10) even an alternate name for Madhyamaka. Also, in its meanings (3)-(5), the term “mahâmudrâ” is not even unique to Buddhist texts. As Sanderson (2009, 133-34, n. 311) shows, it also appears, for example, in Saivaite scrip­tures, such as the Picumata, a Vidyàpïtha Saiva text, in which the term “Mahâmudrâ” refers to the primary female consort of the chief male deity (in this case Bhairava).707. Compare Gampopa’s Pith Instructions on the Two Armors (Mi pham chos kyi bio gros 1997,4:504) saying that minds being without arising is the dharmakâya. Its being without ceasing is the sambhogakàya. Its being without abiding is the nirmànakàya. In a mind that realizes the three kàyas, they are inexpressible as being diverse, their essence is free from identification, and they are beyond being objects of mind—this is the svàbhàvikakàya. Pamo Trupa’s Two Armors of Connate Union (Phag mo gru pa rdo rje rgyal po 2003, 4:301) literally says the same on the first two kâyas. It continues that mind’s being unidentifiable is the nirmànakàya and that the svàbhàvikakàya refers to the three kàyas’ being without difference.708. Note that this explanation of Mahâmudrâ as the basis of both samsàra and nirvâna greatly resembles Gô Lotsàwa’s description of buddha nature (see the section “Go Lotsàwa’s Unique Mahâmudrâ Interpretation of the Uttaratantra”).709. Ibid., fols. 296a.5 and 297a. 1-2.710. The term rarely occurs in Saraha’s famous trilogy of dohàs for the people, the queen, and the king but it is a central theme in his vajraglti quartet consisting of the Kâya- ko sa ) n rta vaj ragïti, Vâkkosarucirasvarajagïti, Ci ttakosâjavajragïti, and Kâyavâccittâma- nasikâra, as well as in his Mahâmudropadesa. As for Tilopa, the term occurs in his DohâkoSa, Acintyamahâmudrâ, and Mahâmudropadesa.711. P3094, fols. 151b.7-153a.8.712. Matsuda 1996, 95; D142, fol. 3a.6-7 (Amanasikârâdhâra: “Once bodhisattva mahàsat- tvas have relinquished all characteristics of conceptions that consist of aspects through not mentally engaging [in them] ...”).713.1.5.1.714.1.8.44ab.715. Technically speaking, self-blessing (Skt. svâdhisthâna, Tib. bdag byin rlabs), lumi­nosity (Skt. prabhâsvaratâ, Tib. ’od gsal), and union (Skt. yuganaddha, Tib. zung ’jug) are the third, fourth, and fifth of the five levels of completion stage practice in the Guhyasamdjatantra. This is a typical example of Maitripa’s freely using vajrayàna terms and notions even in nontantric contexts.716. This is precisely what TOK, 3:375, says above about “sütra Mahâmudrâ”: “one rests in meditative equipoise through being instructed that the subject does not mentally engage in the object—luminosity free from reference points.”717. The forty-three letters and their order (beginning with “A”) that the prajnàpàramità sütra in twenty-five thousand lines lists correspond to the early Arapacana alphabet of"},{"pageNumber":1050,"pageContent":"1034 Notesthe Karosthi language of the northwestern Indian region of Gândhâra, which was later widely used as a mnemonic device to symbolize Buddhist key terms (with each letter’s representing the first letter of a certain Sanskrit word). As in this case, these letters and the terms they stand for were often taken as the bases for contemplating their mean­ings. For example, with regard to all phenomena, the first five letters of the Arapacana alphabet symbolize the following: “A”—being unborn (anutpannatva); “RA”—being free from pollution (mjas, lit. “dust”); “PA”—the ultimate’s (paramdrtha) being empty; “CA”—dying (çyavana) being unobservable; and “NA”—being without name (nâma).718. Compare GCs explanation in the section “Gô Lotsàwa’s Unique Mahâmudrâ In­terpretation of the Uttaratantra” that all five levels of the completion stage of the Guhyasamàjatantra are also found in a passage of the Lahkâvatârasûtra. Sahajavajra’s Tattvadasakatïkâ on 7cd (P3099, fols. 190b. 1-19la.2) explains that mental nonengage­ment does not refer to a complete absence of mental engagement, such as closing ones eyes and then not seeing anything like a vase or a blanket at all. Rather, mental non­engagement refers to the very nonobservation of a nature of entities, be it through analysis or the guru s pith instructions. Therefore, mental nonengagement with regard to characteristics means nothing but fully penetrating the very lack of characteristics. To think, “This is unthinkable and nonconceptual,” is just thinking, but mental non­engagement does not mean that there is absolutely no cognition of the lack of nature. Padma dkar po (2005, 38-42) gives three meanings of amanasikâra, supporting them with the Samvarodayatantra, the Hevajratantra, and the Mahjuérïnâmasamgïti, respec­tively. (1) The letter i in that term represents a locative case (referring to a place or a basis), with a location or basis being what is negated by the first letter a. Thus, the term refers to there being no location, basis, or support on which to focus. Hence, to hold ones mind firmly on its focal object through the mode of apprehension of the mental factor of mental engagement is necessary during the practice of ordinary forms of calm abiding, but here this is to be stopped. (2) Without considering the locative what is negated through the first letter a is mental engagement, that is, mental activity. This refers to eagerly engaging in the mode of apprehension of the mental factor, impulse, or intention (cetanâ), which is the mental activity of mental formation—mind’s en­gaging in virtue, nonvirtue, and what is neutral. The eight formations or applications are needed in order to remove the five flaws in ordinary calm abiding, but Mahâmudrâ meditation is free from doing and does not arise from accumulating. All mental activ­ities are presented here as entailing reference points or focal objects, so what is taught by this is the utter peace of all reference points or focal objects. Therefore, it is said:To the one who does not think through imagination,Whose mind does not abide at all,Who is without mindfulness, is without mental engagement,And is without focus, I pay homage.(3) The initial a in amanasikâra stands for prajnàpàramitâ and all expressions for nondual­ity, such as nonarising (anutpanna) and nonceasing (anirodha). Thus, the term means to mentally engage in a proper manner in this meaning of the letter a. In terms of the vajrayàna, nonduality refers to the union of prajnâ and means, which has the nature of great bliss since this bliss arises from that union. In terms of the pàramitàyàna, duality refers to apprehender and apprehended, me and what is mine, or cognition and what is to be cognized, which will always be dual for as long as there is mental flux. The identi­tylessness of all phenomena that is free from all flux and without any reference points arises as the kàya whose character is the nature of phenomena, which is nondual in es­sence. This arising of nonduality is specified by the aspect of nonarising and therefore"},{"pageNumber":1051,"pageContent":"Notes 1035is called “the dharma of nonarising.” Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phreng ba (n.d., 325) explains mental nonengagement as follows: “Its meaning is to rest one-pointedly on the focal object [of meditation], without being distracted by other thoughts. If this [one-pointed resting] were stopped, all samâdhis would stop. Therefore, in general, ‘mental nonen­gagement* has the meaning of not mentally engaging in any object other than the very focus of the [respective] samadhi. In particular, when focusing on the ultimate, [mental nonengagement] has the meaning of letting [the mind] be without even apprehending this ‘ultimate.* However, this should not be understood as being similar to having fallen asleep.” In brief, amanasikàra can be understood as either (1) no engagement in the mind, (2) no engagement of or by the mind, or (3) proper mental engagement in the meaning of prajnàpàramità. In his Ri chos kyi mal *byor bzhi pa phyag rgya chen po snying po’i don gyi gter mdzod (Rgyal ba yang dgon pa 1984, 1:247-48), the early Drugpa Kagyii master, Gyalwa Yanggônpa (Tib. Rgyal ba yang dgon pa; 1213-1258), interprets mental nonengagement (Tib. yid la mi byed pa) as an absence of mental engagement in the sense of not dwelling in mentation (yid), being liberated from men­tation, or transcending mentation. More specifically, he explains the term through its component “mentation,” which he, following classical Yogàcàra teachings, presents as twofold—being afflicted and being what triggers the other six active consciousnesses. He says that with thoughts and imagination functioning as the cognizing subjects of bases of mistakenness, “mental nonengagement” means that these engagers do not en­gage in such a way. With this understanding of the term, even when there is mental nonengagement in this sense, there is still engagement in ones own mind. This means that however the àlaya-consciousness and the five sense consciousnesses may arise, their being self-lucid in a nonconceptual state is Mahàmudrà’s very own basic ground. When the afflicted mind (nyon yid) looks inward at the àlaya-consciousness, it takes it to be a self. When the mental consciousness (yid shes) looks outward through the five sense gates, it breaks up the àlaya-consciousness into distinct objects. Thus, all the subjects and objects of this twofold mentation (yid) are the phenomena of samsàra, and all clinging to good and bad are just this mentation. To go beyond this and not dwell in it is Mahâmudrâ in the sense of mental nonengagement. In other words, he says that “mental nonengagement” does not imply a complete stop of all mental ac­tivity but only of the dualistic mental engagements that appear as dealing with our assumed self and its separate objects. The same authors Ri chos yon tan kun ’byung gi lhan thabs chen mo (ibid., 2:76) adds that if the term “mental nonengagement” had been translated as “not dwelling in mentation,” it would have been straightforward, but since it was translated as it is (lit. “not doing [anything] in mentation”), some people went a bit wrong. When they speak of “mental nonengagement in the past, present, and future,” they take “mentation” as the subject and the three times as the objects and then say that not engaging in them is “mental nonengagement.” However, the past, the future, the present, existence, nonexistence, samsàra, and nirvâna are all nothing but superimpositions by mentation anyway. Here, the point of mental nonengagement in the context of Mahâmudrâ—be it understood as “not engaging in mentation” or “not dwelling in mentation”—is, in brief, not to dwell in either existence, nonexistence, past, future, samsàra, or nirvana. Thus, the terms “beyond mind” (bio ’das), “free from ref­erence points,” “union” (zung ’jug), and “Mahâmudrâ” are all equivalent. Compare also the two meanings of amanasikàra explained in the section on the Eighth Situpa, and see the discussion of mental nonengagement in Sahajavajras Tattvadasakatïkâ (Brunn­hôlzl 2007a, 177-81 and Brunnhôlzl 2004, 52-57 and 310-20) for the significance and scope of this often misinterpreted term and its relation to Mahâmudrâ."},{"pageNumber":1052,"pageContent":"1036 Notes719.

Compare Vajrapâni’s Guruparamparakramopadeéa (D3716, fol. 179a.3-6), which also says that Mahämudrä does not involve the moments of the four joys because it is the stainless fruition in which there is nothing to be established or to be blocked. Speak­ing of instantaneous perfect awakening, Vajrapäni says that when not realized, it is samsara, and when it is realized, the very same is Mahämudrä.722. For example, the Käyaväkcittämanasikära (D2272, fol. 118b7) and Doha- kosanämamahämudropadesa (D2273, fol. 123a.7) attributed to Saraha, a quote at­tributed to Kotäli (see the Vajragitibhävanopadesatilakakanakamälä [D2449, fol. 84a.3-4] and the Caturaéitisiddhasambodhihrdaya [D2292, fol. 156a.4-5]), as well as three quotes from three siddhas in Räjaputranrsimhas Sarvayogatattvälokanämasaka- lasiddhavajragîti (D2453, fois. lOOb.2, lllb.5, and 113b.6).723.

In the Pancatathägatamudrävivarana (Mikkyô-seiten kenkyükai 1988, 189), Mai­trlpa equates the dharmakaya with “wisdom without appearances” and the rüpakäyas with “illusion that arises during subsequent attainment.” It is in order to clarify the relationship between these two käyas that he quotes Uttaratantra II.61b. In his Catur- mudränikaya (Mikkyô-seiten kenkyükai 1989,243), Maitrlpa quotes what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 to support his statement that cessation is the direct perception of the nature of connateness. I am indebted to Mr. Kazuo Kano for having drawn my attention to these two references.738. D2256, fol. 187b.2-5.739. Some Tibetan renderings of what corresponds to Uttaratantra 1.154 and Abhisa­mayälamkära V.21b (such as in Sahajavajras Tattvadasakatikä) read bsnan par bya ba versus bzhag par bya ba, but that is not consistent and therefore is, in itself, not suffi­cient evidence for such a quotes being from one of these two texts rather than the other.

On the other hand, some Tibetan authors such as Tàranàtha (see Templeman 1983, 11) report that Atisa expelled Maitripa from Vikramaéîla for having engaged in vaj- rayàna practices that involved women and alcohol. However, this account is not found in non-Tibetan sources, and it is unclear that the one who was expelled was indeed Maitripa, given that the name “Maitri” served as a rather common epithet for many persons. In any case, there are some chronological problems surrounding Maitripas having taught Atisa. The dates of Atiéa are well established as 982-1054, and it is clearly documented that he left India in 1040, arrived in Tibet in 1042, and stayed there until his death. As already mentioned, Maitripas dates are more problematic (they range from 983-1060 to c. 1010-c. 1087). It is clear from Maitripas biography that he only met Savaripa, from whom he received the dohâ tradition of Mahâmudrâ, when he was fifty-three (which would be 1039 according to Roberts earlier dates of Maitripa) and thus only returned to the academic environment after 1040. Consequently, even with Roberts’ earlier dates, it is quite unlikely for him to have met Atisa before the latter went to Tibet. There is a little bit better chance, if one chooses 983 as Maitripa s birth year, but then there is a potential conflict with his having taught Marpa Chôkyi Lodrd. BA and many other sources have Marpa s dates as 1012-1097 (though other sources have ear­lier dates). Chos kyi 'byung gnas (Situpa VIII) and ’Be lo tshe dbang kun khyab (2005, 1:73-75), giving Marpa’s birth year as 1000, and BA agree that Marpa met Maitripa"},{"pageNumber":1054,"pageContent":"1038 Notesduring his last journey to India. According to BA, he returned from his second journey when he was forty-two, then married his wife and obviously stayed in Tibet for some years. Thus, his last journey to India could have begun only in his late forties or early fifties, that is, around 1060. Furthermore, if Maitrlpa’s later dates as per BA and Tatz (c. 1010-c. 1087) are correct, it would be unlikely in the context of Indo-Tibetan teach- er-student relationships for Maitripa as the far younger one to teach the older Atiéa. Still, if one accepts that Maitripa rediscovered the Uttaratantra and received teachings on it by Maitreya, Maitripa would have been in a position to teach it to others such as Atiéa despite his being their junior. The problem with Maitripa s teaching the dohâs to Atisa is more substantial though because Maitripa would have to have received them from someone else long before he received them from Savaripa, of which there is no indication in Maitrlpa’s biographies and that seems very unlikely. In any case, what is undisputed about Attéa is that he translated the Uttaratantra and R G W with Nagtso Lotsâwa and obviously also taught these texts.760. 261 and 844.761.455.762.

According to Padma dkar po (2005, 7-37), “the seven Siddhi works” (Tib. grub pa sde bdun) are (1) Padmavajra’s Sakalatantrasambhavasamcodanïsrïguhyasiddhi, (2) Anangavajra’s Prajnopâyavinikayasiddhi, (3) Indrabhüti’s Jnânasiddhinâmasâdhana,(4) Laksmï s Advayasiddhisâdhana, (5) Dàrika’s Sri uddiyânavinirgataguhyamahâguh- yatattvopadesa andSahajayoginï Cintâ’s Vyaktabhâvânugatatattvasiddhi (Padma Karpo says that these two are counted as one due to their similar names), (6) Camari’s Prajnopàyaviniscayasamudaya, and (7) Laksmï Bhattàrikà’s Sahajasiddhipaddhati (D2117-2222, D2381, and D2261, respectively). Mi pham chos kyi bio gros (1997, 1:31-216) omits Camaris text and replaces Laksmï s commentary by Dombi Heruka’s SrJsahajasiddhi (D2223). “The sixfold cycle of the essence” (Tib. snying po skor drug) consists of (1) Saraha s Dohakosa (D2224), (2) the Tattvopadeéasikharadohagïti (D2276; attributed by Padma Karpo to Saraha), Aryadeva’s (3) Cittâvaranavisodhananàmapra- karana (D1804) and (4) Svâdhisthânakramaprabheda (D1805), (5) Nâgàrjunagarbha’s CaturmudrâniScaya (D2225), and (6) Kuddàlï’s Acintyakramopadesa (D2228). Besides these she, Padma Karpo here also includes the remaining dohà works of Saraha (such as his “Dohà for the Queen,” “Dohà for the King,” and Kakhasyadohà with its autocom­mentary), as well as “the three bodhisattva commentaries” (Vajrapàni’s commentary on the Cakrasamvaratantra, the Vimalaprabhâ commentary on the Kâlacakratantra by Kalkin Pundarika, and Vajragarbha’s Hevajrapindârthatïkà), Nàgàrjuna’s Cittavaj- rastava, and so on. Mi pham chos kyi bio gros (1997,1:284-392) omits (4) and (5) and replaces them by Devacandra’s Prajnàjnànaprakàsa (D2226) and Sahajavajra’s Sthiti- samuccaya (D2227). Padma Karpo also says that the four transmission lineages of all these works came together in Kuddàlï and then were transmitted through Lavapa,.Ti- lopa, and Nàropa. Another lineage went from Kuddàlï to Savaripa and then Maitripa.787. Sgam po pa bsod nams rin chen 1982, Phag mogrupa’i zhu lan, vol. kha, 74.788. Sometimes Gampopa even criticizes ordinary vajrayàna for descending to the level of conceptualization (see D. Jackson 1994, 34).789.

Tib. sems tsam mam rdzun gyi dbu ma.823. BA’s chapter on the transmission of Mahamudra (841-86) consists of the transmis­sion of the Indian dohá lineage (whose primary topic is of course Mahamudra). From Maitrlpa, this lineage went to his four main students Sahajavajra, Devákaracandra, Rámapála, and Vajrapáni, but it was only the latter who actually transmitted it to Tibet. In that regard, BA describes “the upper tradition of Mahamudra ’ (Vajrapáni) and “the lower tradition” (transmitted by the Nepalese master Asu, who spent most of his life in central Tibet). The followers of the first tradition speak of “the upper translation” transmitted by Vajrapáni; “the lower translation,” by Asu; and “the later translation,” by Nagpo Sherdé (Tib. Nag po sher dad), who studied with Vajrapáni in India when the lat­ter was already very old. Marpa’s tradition of the Mahámudrá dohás is referred to here as “additional translation” (zur gyur). Among many other students, Vajrapáni taught"},{"pageNumber":1057,"pageContent":"Notes 1041Mahâmudrâ also to Nagtso Lotsâwa. Vajrapâni s student, the Kashmiri Dharmaárl, who accompanied him, also taught Mahâmudrâ. One of Asu s main disciples was Barpuwa Lodrô Sengé (Tib. Par phu ba bio gros seng ge; twelfth century), the author of eight commentaries on Sarahas dohàs, which are to this day regarded as the primary early Tibetan commentaries on the dohâ tradition. Among Barpuwa’s many students, there was Rimibabpa Sonarn Rinchen (Tib. Ri mi ’babs pa bsod nams rin chen; 1362-1453), who transmitted the dohàs and Mahâmudrâ to Gô Lotsâwa.824. Tib. dkar po gcig thub. This term is found in the writings of Gampopa, Lama Shang, and some other early Kagyü masters. As a physician, Gampopa was of course familiar with this medical term for certain powerful remedies (plants and minerals) that are said to cure all diseases. However, the term occurs only three times in his preserved teach­ings. For example, in his Answers to Pamo Truba (Phaggru’i zhus lan; Collected Works, 1:472), he says that once the realization of the inconceivable nature of phenomena has arisen, it “becomes the single white panacea—knowing one, all is liberated” (dkar po chig thub gcig shes kun grol song ba). A more substantial source for this term’s being linked specifically with Mahâmudrâ is the twelfth chapter (dkar po chig thub tu bstan pa’i leu) of Lama Shangs Ultimate Profound Path of Mahâmudrâ (see Martin 1992, 290-92; the term is also mentioned at the end of chap. 9, p., 285). Just as the white panacea, Mahâmudrâ is considered to be the single sufficient remedy for all diseases of mental affliction and obscuration, allowing mind to regain its own natures fundamen­tal sanity. The notion of any spiritual practices being a single self-sufficient cause for awakening was criticized by Sakya Pandita and others and even unjustly equated with the “view of Hvashang” (who, in one of his\" writings, also used the example of a single panacea). The latter view became a Tibetan stereotype for the exclusive cultivation of a thought-free mental state—as representing realization of the ultimate—along with a complete rejection of the aspect of means, such as the accumulation of merit and proper ethical conduct. However, the teachings on Mahâmudrâ are far from merely advocating nonthinking or some type of mental blankness. This is also what Lama Shang explains, and the last verse of his above-mentioned chapter explicitly says that, as long as there is clinging to a self, karma and its maturation exist and it is essential to relinquish negative actions and accumulate merit. Later, Padma Karpos Treasure Vault of the Victors (Padma dkar po 2005) gave a highly detailed account of all the main sources of the Mahâmudrâ system and its relation to Madhyamaka, the sûtras, and the tantras, invalidating claims that Mahâmudrâ is not found in the sutras or that it is sim­ply equivalent to the doctrine of Hvashang (for more details, see Broido 1987, D. Jack­son 1990a, and Takpo Tashi Namgyal 1986, 97-108). “The view of Hvashang” refers to the approach ascribed by Tibetans to the Chinese Chan master Hvashang Mahàyàna from Dunhuang, as it is reported to have been refuted in the debate at Samyé by Ka- malaálla. This led to Tibetans henceforth, by decree of the king, largely adopting the Indian approach of the gradual path versus what was perceived as the “Chinese” model of instantaneous awakening. From that time onward in Tibet, Hvashangs name and view became a pejorative cliché freely applied to what certain people considered flawed Buddhist approaches in the above sense. However, there are a number of different Ti­betan versions of the debate at Samyé, with the more verifiable one giving a different account of what Hvashang actually said. In addition, the Tibetan and Chinese docu­ments on the debate found at Dunhuang differ greatly from the “official” Tibetan story. For example, Tibetan fragments of Hvashangs own teachings and Wang Hsis Tun-wu ta-tch’eng cheng-li chiieh (which presents Hvashang and not Kamalaáíla as the winner in the debate) show Hvashangs view and meditation instructions to be much more refined"},{"pageNumber":1058,"pageContent":"1042 Notesand detailed than the usual indigenous Tibetan accounts. The Dunhuang documents also provide clear evidence that Ch’an teachings had been translated into Tibetan and continued to be transmitted in Tibet even after their supposed prohibition as one of the outcomes of the debate at Samye. In any case, it was mostly due to subsequent intra-Ti­betan disputes that this encounter and its issues gained such importance in Tibet. For the complexity of the events surrounding the debate at Samy£, see also Gomez 1983, Broido 1987, Karmay 1988, and D. Jackson 1990a.825. BA, 724.826. Tib. Khro phu lo tsa ba byams pa dpal. BA (709-11) describes Tropu Lotsawa’s studies in India and Nepal with Mitrayogin, then BuddhaSri, and finally SakyaSribhadra, as well as his invitations of these three (one after the other) to Tibet, where he further studied with them. He also received instructions on Mahamudra from his two uncles Gyaltsa Rinchen Gon (Tib. Rgyal tsha rin chen mgon; 1118-1195) and Klinden Repa (both direct disciples of Pamo Truba), as well as from a direct student of Gampopa named Longdsewa (Tib. Klong rtse ba).

Though Târanàtha (1980,196-97,210-11, and 277) men­tions Paramasena as a student of Âryavimuktisena and as a teacher of Vinitasena and says that Vairocanabhadra was the prajnàpàramità teacher of Haribhadra, no further information about any of these masters is available. The same goes for the two Kusu- lipas.

In a general mahàyâna sense, the term “poised readiness” (Skt. ksànti, Tib. bzodpa; lit. “patience,” “endurance”) means to be mentally open and ready for the direct realization of emptiness, aka “the dharma of nonarising” (Skt. anutpattidharma, Tib. mi skye ba’i chos). Thus, it does not mean passively enduring or bearing something, but rather in­dicates an active willingness and receptiveness to integrate the experience of emptiness into ones mind stream and to be able to live within its utter groundlessness. In a more specific sense, “poised readiness” refers to the third of the four levels of the path of preparation, on which the practitioner newly attains some degree of openness and calm in the sense of not being afraid of profound emptiness. However, the actual poised readiness of directly realizing this emptiness is attained only on the path of seeing. For the most part, the path of familiarization then consists of increasing and stabilizing ones familiarity with this realization in all situations. On the eighth bhümi, “the poised readiness for the dharma of nonarising” reaches its culmination.901. GC, 465.4-12.902. Ibid., 465.12-16. See also Mathes 2008a, 381-86.903. Though Go Lotsawa does not do so, in this context of connecting the four yogic prac­tices with Mahâmudrâ, one could very well point to Jnànakirti’s Tattvâvatàra (P4532, fois. 70b.l-72a.6) as an Indian predecessor of linking these four with Mahâmudrâ in a more general way through his explanation of Lahkàvatàrasütra X.256-57.904. 74.7-14 (Mathes 2008a, 302-3).905. The commentaries on the Abhisamayàlamkâra explain that among the three stages of the levels of heat, the focal object of the greater stage consists of the conventional phenomena that are imputed as designations—the phenomena that are specified by the mere names of form up through the knowledge of all aspects. The cognitive aspect of this stage is that, ultimately, said phenomena are inexpressible as being either virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral.906. The focal object of great peak consists of form and so on being free from characteris­tics—ultimately, the characteristics of form and so on (such as blue or yellow) are not seen. Its cognitive aspect is the realization that when all phenomena are investigated by the prajna of realizing the nature of phenomena, all entities are unobservable as being real.907. The focal object of lesser poised readiness consists of form and so on being without a real nature. Its cognitive aspect is the realization that from the perspective of those who possess clinging, the very nonbeing of a nature in true reality appears as a real nature.908. The focal object of great poised readiness consists of form and so on being with­out difference, that is, having the common nature of the three that consist of samàdhi (the familiarization), bodhisattvas (the ones who familiarize), and the actuality of pra- jnâpàramità (the object of familiarization). Its cognitive aspect is the realization that the path of seeing—the supreme means for accomplishing buddhahood—is the path of nonconceptuality even within the samàdhi that is the cognizing subject of realizing that all phenomena to be examined in it as focal objects do not exist ultimately.909. For details, see the introduction in Brunnholzl 2010.910. 271.15-272.10.911. XIII. 18. This is followed by:It is held that mind, which is always naturally luminous,Is [only] blemished by adventitious flaws.Apart from the mind that is the nature of phenomena, no other mind Is proclaimed to be luminous in nature.912. 430.24-431.13 and 433.6-12."},{"pageNumber":1062,"pageContent":"1046 Notes913. 59.1-11 (Mathes 2008a, 274-75).914. The common Yogàcâra term “mental discourse” (Skt. manojalpa, Tib. yid kyi brjod pa) is usually employed in two ways. It is either an expression for all appearances in terms of apprehender and apprehended being nothing but expressions of minds con­tinuous discursive play (or, put less politely, being just our incessant mental chatter). Or it refers to a bodhisattva’s analytical meditation as a form of systematical inner dialogue with oneself. Here, it means the latter.915. XIV.7. According to Sthiramati’s Sütrâlamkâravrttibhâsya (D4034, fols. 265b.5- 266a.3), “investigate” refers to meditations that entail both coarse examination and subtle analysis, thus corresponding to the effective preparatory stage of the first dhyàna and the first dhyàna itself. “Discriminate” refers to meditations that entail only sub­tle analysis, thus corresponding to the intermediate dhyàna and the second dhyàna. “Without [mental] discourse and of one taste” refers to meditations through the men­tal engagement that entails neither examination nor analysis, thus corresponding to the third and fourth dhyànas. For, at that time, one meditates solely internally, free from any mental discourse of examination or analysis. Thus, one continuously engages in the nonconceptual one taste that is free from examination and analysis.916. 16.17-17.23 and 141.23-24.917. D45.48, fol. 271a.4-5.918. J14-15.919. 142.23-24.920. 144.13-22.921. On this section on the first two Mahâmudrâ yogas, see also Mathes 2008a, 386-89.922. 149.16-20.923. IV.99cd.924. 166.13-19.925. GC matches these five steps with a passage from the Lahkavatarasutra (saying that he follows Àryadevas statement that this sütra teaches those five steps) and also with Uttaratantra IV.3-4 (59.24-61.18; Mathes 2008a, 276-79).926. 113.6-114.8927. Lines 216-20. These five are that (1) nonconceptual wisdom is not the total absence of mental engagement. Though the cognitions of small children or someone who is just spaced out do not engage in the reference points of worldly conventions, these beings are not liberated through that. In nonconceptual wisdom s direct seeing of the nature of phenomena, all reference points have vanished. Without any reference point on the object side to engage in anymore, on the subject side any mental engagement in such reference points naturally subsides. However, this does not mean that this wisdom lacks wakefulness and one-pointed sharp mindfulness. It is also not without any cognitive capacity and clarity since it directly realizes the nature of phenomena without any du­alistic split into apprehender and apprehended. (2) Nonconceptual wisdom is also not a mere transcendence of conceptions in the sense of lacking any coarse or subtle concep­tual analysis. Therefore, though all mundane meditative states from the second dhyàna of the form realm onward are without such analysis, they lack the qualities of noncon­ceptual wisdom. (3) Nonconceptual wisdom is not the complete subsiding of concep­tions either. Otherwise, being asleep, intoxicated, having fainted, and the meditative absorption of cessation would also qualify as nonconceptual wisdom. (4) Nor is non­conceptual wisdom something like inert and unconscious matter, which simply lacks conceptions by its very nature. (5) Nonconceptual wisdom is also not the picturing of nonconceptuality. This means that the actual defining characteristic of nonconceptual"},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"Notes 1047wisdom is that which observes true reality. Unlike in a visual consciousness and so on, the nature of that realization does not involve any variety or multiplicity. Thus, non­conceptuality means completely letting go of all discursiveness and reference points, in particular with regard to true reality, such as trying to pinpoint a certain meditative ex­perience, thinking, “This is nonconceptuality.” Naturally, nonconceptual wisdom does not just mean a state of trying not to think or imagine anything either, or just trying to think, “I shall not think.” For all such cases are simply subtle thoughts or grasping.928. 114.8-12.929. This expression can refer to both the paths of accumulation and preparation or the latter alone.930. 114.12-15.931. “The principle of the nature of phenomena” (Skt. dharmatâyuktih, Tib. chos nyid kyi rigs pa) is the last one of “the four principles” (Skt. yukti, Tib. rigs pa), with the other three being the principles of (1) dependence (Skt. apeksâyuktih, Tib. Itospai rigs pa), (2) performing activity (Skt. kâryakâranayuktih, Tib. bya ba byed pa’i rigs pa), and (3) demonstrating evidence (Skt. upapattisâdhanayuktih, Tib. ’thad pas grub pai rigs pa). Though these four principles are often rendered as “the four reason(ing)s” (par­ticularly in translations from Tibetan), as RGW and the discussions of these four in the Sràvakabhümi, the Abhidharmasamuccaya, and the Samdhinirmocanasütra clarify, yukti is equivalent to yoga and upâya, any of which can mean “application,” “means,” and “expedient.” For details on these four principles, see the note in Mipham Rin- poches discussion of Uttaratantra 1.28 in appendix 1.932.

Compare BA (839-41), which says that Mahâmudrâ is what seals all practices of the Buddhas teachings, from the pràtimoksa up through the glorious Guhyasamâjatantra. There is no liberation without realizing identitylessness, which is twofold—personal identitylessness and phenomenal identitylessness. In particular, in order to relinquish the cognitive obscurations, the view about any phenomenal identity must be relin­quished. BA continues: “Through the view of realizing emptiness, the view about [real] phenomena is relinquished—it is relinquished by way of [these two views] being con­tradictory in their modes of apprehension. In order to give rise to the view of empti­ness, one enters the ocean of scriptures and reasonings.

In ancient Indian cosmology, solar and lunar eclipses are regarded as the sun or moon being swallowed by the demon Ràhu, since he envies them for their light. However, he is not able to retain them in his body and thus has to release them very quickly.962. Interestingly, the Anguttaranikdya (1.253-54 and 1.275; III. 16) also speaks about mind’s needing to be freed from the same five obscuring stains in order to regain its natural state. Also, Vasubandhus Madhyântavibhàgabhàsya (Nagao ed., 18.43-44) says that mind is similar to the sky by virtue of its luminosity, since all manifold phenomena are as adventitious with regard to the mind as are dust, smoke, clouds, and mist with regard to the sky.963. 47.18-48.10.964.215.22-216.2.965.46.17-47.3.966.

The last two lines of this verse in the Tengyur read:"},{"pageNumber":1065,"pageContent":"Notes 1049Its the very lack of nature of phenomena That you should cultivate as dharmadhâtu.970. Compare the Third Karmapa’s commentary on these verses (Rang byung rdo rje 2006c, 51-53, 55-56, and 59), which explicitly links them to Mahâmudrâ meditation and fur­ther explains how the nature of the mind is found within dualistic consciousness. The Karmapa says that those who understand the dharmadhâtu, which is naturally lumi­nous, and the teaching of the unsurpassable yàna immerse themselves in meditation by beginning with the preliminaries according to the common yâna. Thereafter, they manifest the samàdhi whose nature is superior insight and that focuses on suchness, the characteristic of the dharmadhâtu that is expressed by the terms “prajnàpàramità” and “Mahâmudrâ.” At the point of resting in meditative equipoise in this way, they should meditate in a way of withdrawing all thoughts. During the time of subsequent realization, they should meditate with mindfulness by examining phenomena as fol­lows. The eye sense faculty serves as the dominant condition of the eye-consciousness. Minds appearing as the aspects of color and shape, which appear as if external, serves as the object condition. The momentary stirring of mentation that dwells in the mind serves as the immediate condition. Thus, an eye-consciousness appears to arise. From these three conditions, appearances without a stain occur, which means that unmis­taken perception free from thoughts takes place. What appears as form unaffected by superimposing conceptions is, in its own essence, both appearing and empty, unborn and unceasing, and mere cognizance. This is also called “perceptual valid cognition based on the eye sense faculty.” This actuality appears for ordinary beings, but since they do not realize it, mentation immediately makes them superimpose something and has them conceive of, and cling to, shapes, colors, the internal, and the external, such as, “This is a pillar” or “This is white.” This leads to grasping, which in turn causes arising and ceasing. Based on that, the production of the conventionalities of causes, the con­ventionalities of results, and the conventionalities of the three times and so on is taken up since beginningless time and then serves as the basis for what follows. Through causing these mirage-like processes and more, mentation renders us mistaken. The no­ble ones who possess the eye of prajnà see just what is unmistaken and do not raise the web of thoughts. Therefore, theirs is a perception that is based on the sense faculties of yogins. As for those who are not noble ones but emulate their kind of perception, their unmistaken cognizance that observes what appears as if external is valid cognition be­cause it is similar to yogic perception. Exactly that which resembles the true actuality of the nature of phenomena is the valid cognition of this true actuality. Here, “true actu­ality” refers to the factor of self-lucid consciousness. Apart from consciousness merely appearing as if it were something external, there are no other external referents that are real as minute particles and so on. Therefore, one will realize that self-lucid appearances lack arising and ceasing and become certain that they are just the dharmadhâtu. In gen­eral, the actual causal condition of the three conditions for each sense consciousness is the ultimate mind as such. However, in terms of seeming reality, through the power of dependent origination, objects, sense faculties, and the immediate mind (Tib. de ma thagyid) appear as if they were causes and conditions. Ultimately, however, there is no arising or ceasing caused by anybody in all of this. It may appear that a magician causes many illusory beings to be born, some to die, some to go, and some to come. But there is no real being born, ceasing, coming, or going in this way, since these very beings are not established in the first place. Just like other causes, such as mantras for produc­ing illusory beings, the conditions of mere thoughts that do not realize their nature indeed appear. But through realizing their luminous nature as being without arising"},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"1050 Notesand ceasing, they become what they truly are—the dharmadhàtu. Mind is also the prin­cipal of all phenomena because, in its nature, it is just dependent origination without conception. Hence, having realized it in this way, conceptions and what they concep­tualize due to characteristics—all conceptions about the external and the internal—are relinquished and mind is found not to exist by a nature of its own. Therefore, it is to be realized as the dharmadhàtu, which means that all phenomena lack a nature. On the paths of accumulation and preparation, one should cultivate this through aspiring for it. In terms of direct perception from the path of seeing onward, this is the samâdhi of the appearance of nonconceptual wisdom, which is prajfiäpäramitä. As for cultivating ultimate reality on the path of preparation, the Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhisamayälamkära (Brunnholzl 2010, 418-19) says that the point when the freedom from all characteristics of apprehender and apprehended is directly realized is the path of seeing, which has the character of yogic direct valid cognition. These meditative equipoises of the path of preparation are unmistaken, self-aware, direct, valid cogni­tions that are concordant with the unmistaken wisdom that lacks the duality of appre­hender and apprehended. During the path of preparation, these meditative equipoises are not something other than self-aware, direct, valid cognitions because both what is aware and what it is aware of arise as the nature of a single clear and aware experience. The Third Karmapas autocommentary on his Profound Inner Reality (Rang byung rdo rje n.d., fol. 163b) states that when embraced by the correct yoga, sense perception, mental direct perception, and self-aware direct perception are all yogic direct percep­tion, connate wisdom’s own nature (for further details, see Brunnholzl 2007b, 245-51).971. 121.14-122.5.972. Note that this example is also found in the Mahâbherïsûtra (D222, fois, llla.2-4) and the Angulimällyasütra (D213, fols. 157b.7-158a.2).973. For GCs relating the Uttaratantra to Mahämudrä, see also “Zhönu Pal’s Mahämudrä Interpretation” in Mathes 2008a, 367-410.974. 471.24-472.2. Elsewhere, GC (208.6-209.2) elaborates further on the notion of “fun­damental change.” As for why awakening and its qualities (the fifth and sixth vajra points in the Uttaratantra) are called “fundamental change,” GC says that “the foun­dation” in this term is like a guesthouse, while “change” refers to the guests’ having left and thus not being benefited anymore by that guesthouse. Then, GC quotes Jnänacan- dra’s Käyatrayavrtti, Vinltadeva’s Trimiikätikä, and Ratnäkarasänti’s Prajnäpäramito- padeia as examples of the learned explaining the term “fundamental change” as having the meaning of “ceasing” or “coming to an end.” Therefore, RGVV’s quote from the Abhidharmamahäyänasütra “The dhätu of beginningless time is the foundation of all phenomena” refers to this notion of “fundamental change” in that the tathägata heart has ceased, or changed from, being what functions as the basis, support, and founda­tion of all samsäric phenomena before and later functions as the support of purified phenomena. Furthermore, GC (453.11-18) explains that stainless suchness is presented as the fundamental change of buddhas. Here, “the foundation” is the uncontaminated dhätu and the meaning of “change” is “coming to an end” because all stains or obscu­rations in this dhätu have become separated from it and come to an end. Referring to the same lines from the Abhidharmamahäyänasütra, GC says that because suchness has functioned as the foundation or support of afflicted phenomena since beginningless time, it is also to be described as “host” (gnas po) and quotes line 80a of Nägamitras Käyatrayävatäramukha (“The host’s having changed into something else”) in support. Accordingly, suchness is called “fundamental change” because having changed into another nature later, it functions as the support of the pure qualities. Also, as Mathes"},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"Notes 1051(2008a, 420) reports, Gô Lotsàwa’s biographer (the Fourth Shamarpa) says that Go crit­icized Dôlpopa’s stance that karmic appearances and the appearances of wisdom are two separate entities that have been mixed (Dôlpopa is well known for his strict sepa­ration of the two realities or the tathagata heart and its adventitious stains). Rather, Go Lotsawa is said to prefer the description of the relationship between these two using the example of water and ice as being only different states of the same substance).975.

This transmission is called “Ganden ear-whispered lineage” or “Wensa ear-whispered lineage.” Note though that the Panchen Lamas text does not mention Tsongkhapa as the origin of these Mahâmudrâ teachings but says that they are the system of Chôkyi Dorje. In fact, the members and contents of the short and long lineages of this transmission as presented here appear to have been established only at the time of Yeshé Gyaltsen (Tib. Ye shes rgyal mtshan; 1713-1797).983. Tib. Bio bzang chos kyi rgyal mtshan.984. The First Panchen Lama passed on these teachings to two of his main disciples— Drubchen Gendiin Gyaltsen (Tib. Grub chen dge ’dun rgyal mtshan) and Lobsang Dsôndrü Gyaltsen (Tib. Bio bzang brtson ’grus rgyal mtshan; 1567-1650). From them two lineages originated, which were eventually reunited in Papongka Rinpoche (Tib. Pha bong kha rin po che; 1871-1941).985. Dalai Lama and Berzin 1997, 230: “When the First Panchen Lama discusses the Ge- lug/Kagyii tradition of mahamudra, he is referring to a tradition that takes as its basis the oral guidelines of the great Kagyü masters of the past and supplements it with the profound methods for gaining a decisive understanding of voidness that Tsongkhapa has uniquely presented in his great texts concerning the madhyamaka view. Thus this tradition seems, I believe, to be a synthesis of Kagyü and Gelug approaches. Although at various points in his autocommentary, the Panchen Lama quotes several texts from the Sakya tradition, he specifically mentions here a list of Kagyü masters of old, not Sakya ones, who have concurred on this anuttarayoga tantra level of mahamudra. Fur­thermore, the Sakya tradition asserts only a tantra level of mahamudra, whereas both the Kagyü and the Gelug-Kagyü traditions assert both sütra and tantra levels. Therefore I think that the First Panchen Lama had something specific in mind when he used the term ‘Gelug/Kagyü tradition of mahamudra.’”986. Ibid., 256.987. Takpo Tashi Namgyal 1986,146-74.988.

Note that my numbering of the verses of the Uttaratantra follows the widely accepted one in Johnston’s Sanskrit edition (though there are some unresolved issues with it; see Takasaki 1989 and Kano 2006, 18). The numbering according to the Tibetan versions differs at times. Thus, throughout this book, if a verse number of the Uttaratantra is followed by a “/” with a second number, the latter refers to the number in the Tibetan. The Tibetan versions of the Uttaratantra and R G W reverse 1.27 and L28 (the versions in some commentaries omit 1.27). They also have two extra verses between 1.83 and 1.84 and count the verse in R GW between 1.87 and 1.88 as a root verse. All other verses in the remaining four chapters are the same as in the Sanskrit except for some verses with long Sanskrit meters in chapter 4 being split into two in the Tibetan. The exact variations in chapters 1 and 4 are as follows: 1.27/28, 28/27 ... 83/83, -/84, -/85, 84/86 .. . 87/89, —/90, 88/91 .. . 167/170; IV.33/33, 34 (sàrdülavikrïdita meter)/34+35, 35/36 . . . 40/41, 41 (sikharinl meter)/42+43, 42/44 . . . 45/47, 46 (sragdharà meter)/48+49, 47/50 ... 98/101.996. R G W quotes about one third of this sütra.997. These two quotes are the only known word-for-word citations of this sütra in any In­dian text. As Zimmermann (2002,86) remarks, though the contents of the verses of the Uttaratantra on the nine examples in the Tathàgatagarbhasütra differ quite significantly from it in some cases, many passages in these verses do use the sütra’s vocabulary, faith­fully render its basic themes, and show similar grammatical and syntactical structures. For further similarities between some passages in the Tathàgatagarbhasütra and RGW, see the translation of the latter in this volume.998. CMW (453) says that the Dharanisvararajasutra is the sole primary source of the Uttaratantra, while all other sûtras mentioned in the Uttaratantra and RGW are only secondary sources. For the sometimes differing identifications of the main sütra sources of the Uttaratantra by other Tibetan commentaries, see the descriptions of these commentaries in this volume.999. Also, many scholars hold that the Lahkavatarasutra (and probably the Ghana- vyühasütra) appeared after the Uttaratantra and RGW, but the Ahgulimâlïyasütra, the Mahàparinirvànasütra, and the Mahâbherïsütra are all assumed to have been in existence before.1000. 432-35.1001.423.1002. 2.1003. 236.1004.

Note that V.26-28 are clearly not dedicatory verses but summarize the preceding ten verses of chapter 5.1014. See Kano 2006, 519-35. Kano does not explicitly correlate his topical headings with the verses of the Uttaratantra but the verses in parentheses are compiled here based on Kano’s general agreement with Takasakis outline, the verses of the Uttaratantra mentioned in the interlinear notes of SM (not considered by Takasaki), and Kanos annotations to his translation of the text.1015. According to Uttaratantra 1.133-42, afflictions (l)-(4) are those of ordinary be­ings; (6)-(7), those of learners; and (8)—(9), those of bodhisattvas. Affliction (5)—the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance—is the obscuration of arhats. One reason for its not being mentioned here could be that the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance is also present in learners and in bodhisattvas on the bhümis, thus being implicitly included in (or being the general ground of) afflictions (6)-(9).1016. According to the correlations between the nine topics and the eight afflictions above, one would have to omit topic (6)—manifestation—as well as example (5)—a treasure below the earth (corresponding to the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance) here too. However, verse 24 speaks of “the familiarization that has the character of purification,” which is obviously the remedy for the nine kinds of afflictions in verses 20-22. Thus, the correlations between the ten topics and the nine examples only refer to the elements in the nine examples that illustrate buddha nature and its purification but not to the elements that illustrate the obscuring afflictions. Consequently, one may include topic (6) and example (5) here. For, “manifestation” is the unchanging suchness of ordinary beings, noble ones, and buddhas as it seems to manifest differently during the different phases of the path, which fits well with an unchanging treasure’s being unknown at first, being pointed out and unearthed gradually, and being enjoyed in all its splendor at the end (see Uttaratantra 1.45-46 and 1.112-14).1017. RGW (J26) says: “These three topical points [of the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition] will be taught [in detail] below [through nine examples] according to the Tathâgatagarbhasütra. Prior to that, however, the topic [consisting of these three points] is pointed out in all its aspects in the sense in which it is invariably taught in all the words [of the Buddha].” The latter sentence introduces the following presentation of the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition through the ten topics.1018. Note that RGW on 1.31 explicitly relates all three natures—the dharmakaya, such­ness, and the disposition—to the nature of the tathágata heart in terms of both its specific and general characteristics. The specific characteristic of the dharmakaya is its power to fulfill what one wishes for, thus resembling a wish-fulfilling jewel. Suchness has the specific characteristic of being unchanging, thus resembling space. The disposi­tion has the specific characteristic of moistening sentient beings through compassion,"},{"pageNumber":1070,"pageContent":"1054 Notesthus resembling water. In terms of its general characteristic of being naturally pure and always free from afflictions, the tathàgata heart resembles the natural purity of a wish-fulfilling jewel, space, and water.1019. Again, “manifestation” is included here since it refers to the unchanging suchness of ordinary beings, noble ones, and buddhas and since it corresponds to the example of a treasure.1020. In analogy with SM’s presentation of the nine topics except for “manifestation” (due to suchness’s not being a basis for afflictions) that make one understand eight kinds of affliction, affliction (5)—the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance—is omitted here too.1021. Matching SM’s “disposition that is suchness” with the svàbhàvikakàya is not found explicitly in SM, but it seems appropriate since, among the other three kàyas, the dhar­makaya is said in Uttaratantra 1.150 to arise from the naturally abiding disposition and the two rüpakàyas from the accomplished disposition. Also, suchness appears to be the suitable cause for the svàbhàvikakàya in terms of its primary feature of being endowed with twofold purity—its natural purity and its purity of adventitious stains correspond to the Uttaratantra’s speaking of the tathàgata heart and awakening as being suchness with stains and suchness free from stains, respectively.1022. This is based on RGVV’s (J3—4) matching the last three bhümis with a passage in the Dhâranîsvararâjasütra that is associated with the three jewels (D147, fol. 142a.4-5).1023. The Uttaratantra teaches two different models of the causal relationship between the seven vajra points. The first model in 1.3 identifies the three jewels and the basic element as causes (or as three conditions and one cause, respectively) and the last three vajra points, as results. The second model in 1.23 and 1.26 as well as RGVV on 1.2 describes the basic element as the cause, the last three vajra points as conditions, and the three jewels as results. Ngog Lotsàwa refers to these two models as “the cycle of the nonabid­ing nirvana” and “the cycle of the three jewels,” which he describes extensively at the beginning of his commentary (Rngog lo tsà ba bio Idan shes rab 1993b, fols. 2a.2-6a.5).

It is probably because of this statement that CMW is mistakenly included in a recent publication as a work of Marpa Chôkyi Lodrô (Anonymous 2011). However, while BA reports that Marpa Chôkyi Wangchug translated the Uttaratantra, there is no evidence that Marpa Chôkyi Lodrô ever translated the Uttaratantra or wrote a commentary on it, nor is such asserted in the Kagyü tradition. CMW is not found in two other contem­porary publications of Marpa Chôkyi Lodrô s works (A mgon rin po che 2004, vols. 5-6 and Lho brag mar pa lo tsa’i gsung ’bum [Beijing: Krung go’i bod rig pa dpe skrun khang, 2011]).

A comparison of the two congruent outlines of the Uttaratantra by Ngog Lotsâwa (see Kano 2006, 267-76 and 502-4 as well as 2008a, 150-57) and the outlines in CMW and HLS shows that the latter two differ significantly from the former two as well as be­tween each other. The outlines in CMW and HLS are both of similar length and much more detailed than those by Ngog.1030. Therefore, it is helpful to read CMW in close conjunction with RGW, which enables one to easily match the abbreviated passages from RGW that CMW refers to with their source (due to the consecutive order of these passages in CMW, my translation usually does not indicate the page numbers on which they are found in RGW).1031. Throughout, unless noted otherwise, “the three natures” refers to the dharmakâya, suchness, and the disposition, as listed in Uttaratantra I.143cd-144/146cd-147.1032. That sentient beings are simply equated here with the adventitious obscurations and nonentities may sound unusual and somewhat shocking (the same is repeated later in CMW, saying, “through realizing ones own mind, there is not the slightest to be removed because there is no sentient being to be relinquished apart from [mind’s] play­ing as thoughts without a basis”). However, similar remarks are likewise found in GC (12.25: “sentient beings are [just] a continuous flow of afflictions and suffering”), as well as in the Eighth Karmapa s and the Fifth Shamarpa’s commentaries on the Abhisa­mayâlamkâra. Referring to the Third Karmapa, the Eighth Karmapa (Brunnhôlzl 2010, 439) says, “In his autocommentary on The Profound Inner Reality, he makes a twofold classification [of mind as such], saying, ‘what is pure is expressed as mind, and what is impure is [also] expressed as mind.’ By explaining that those who possess impure mental impulses are sentient beings, he elucidates that the dharmadhâtu does not exist in such sentient beings. He presents these very sentient beings as being the adventitious stains that are produced by false imagination, which mistakenly strays from the dhar- madhàtu. By giving the pure mind names such as ‘ordinary mind,’ ‘original protector,’ and ‘original buddha,’ he says that it is exactly this [mind] that possesses the mode of being inseparable from the buddha qualities. This kind of [pure mind] is also the [buddha] heart that actually fulfills this function.” Based on Uttaratantra 1.35-38, a similar distinction is found in the Eighth Karmapa’s Lamp (31-32): “Unsurpassable completely perfect buddhas, through knowing the entirety of how all phenomena with­out exception actually are and how they appear, clearly realize the basic nature, ultimate reality, as being the páramitás of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self. On the other hand, they clearly realize the ways in which [phenomena] appear—the adventi­tious elements of seeming sentient beings—as being impermanent, suffering, without self, and impure.” Likewise, the Lamp (34) says: “‘What is the meaning of the regent Maitreya’s “distinguishing between phenomena and their true nature” within the mind streams of ordinary beings?’ After having explained phenomena just in general as being the adventitious stains that consist of cognitions and knowable objects [of ordinary beings], he explains their true nature as the sugata heart.” Following the Eighth Kar­mapa’s commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra (Brunnhôlzl 2012, 274-75), the Fifth Shamarpa equates sentient beings with the àlaya-consciousness, the impure dependent nature, nonafflicted ignorance, false imagination, and the consciousness that entails the dualistic appearances of apprehender and apprehended. This accords with what both these authors say on the dharmadhâtu as the disposition for buddhahood (the tathâgata heart). Again relying on the Karmapa, the Shamarpa (ibid., 285) explains: “The statement ‘Sentient beings have the [buddha] heart that fully qualifies as such* is not suitable ultimately, because sentient beings must be presented as the àlaya-con­sciousness, which is the aspect of being mistaken and has never been established right"},{"pageNumber":1072,"pageContent":"1056 Notesfrom the start. You may wonder, ‘So are sentient beings buddhas then?* That is not the case either because adventitious [stains] are certain to perish—it is impossible for them to be permanent. Nevertheless, from the perspective of convention, at the time of the ground, it is suitable to present merely the existence of one part of this Heart—its aspect of natural purity—in sentient beings, without it, however, being contained in, being mixed with, or being connected to the mind streams of these sentient beings. Uttaratantra [1.129] says:... the beginningless cocoonsOf the afflictions that are not connected toThe basic element of sentient beings ...In this context, the following statement applies: ‘Sentient beings are not the cause of buddhahood, but it is buddhahood itself that has become buddhahood.’” Conse­quently, the Eighth Karmapa declares that it is impossible for sentient beings to become buddhas because they are the adventitious stains and thus have to disappear in order for the tathagata heart to clearly manifest as buddhahood. The Shamarpa also states that “cloud-like adventitious stains obscure space-like suchness” (Brunnholzl 2010, 275). This is in accord with Uttaratantra 1.52-63 saying that all the factors that make up a sentient being—improper mental engagement, afflictions, karma, skandhas, dhätus, and äyatanas (which resemble the material elements)—rest on the nature of the mind, which resembles space. Likewise, Uttaratantra II.4-6 describes buddhahood as being like the sunlit sky, while all obscurations are like clouds in that sky. In sum, despite the many more conventional statements and examples in the Uttaratantra and elsewhere that buddha nature exists within sentient beings or the obscurations, as the above ex­planations show, in actual fact the obscurations or sentient beings exist within buddha nature. This is only logical since buddha nature is not something with physical or spa­tial dimensions and is certainly not limited to some place within the five skandhas. In other words, in being equivalent to the adventitious stains, sentient beings are nothing but the insubstantial clouds that float in and obscure the infinite sky of the dharma- dhätu. Clinging to a personal self and the resultant notion of a sentient being is just like being stuck on the claustrophobic and gloomy outlook of fixating on the configuration of one of these clouds (which moreover keeps changing all the time) from within that cloud, while being aware of the cloudless and sunlit expanse of the sky without any ref­erence points resembles the nonconceptual wisdom of the dharmadhätu of a buddha.

Later, the use of bsdus don in this sense was commonly replaced by the term sa bead.

Tib. Bkra shis seng ge.1064. In the Lahkavatarasutra, the Buddha lists seven kinds of emptiness, among which the last one is called “the emptiness of one being empty of something other” (itaretarasùnyata). This emptiness is described in terms very similar to those in the Cülasuññatasutta. The Buddha says (Nanjio ed., 75.10-19; D107, fol. 85a.2-5) that something is empty of what does not exist in it. The place where he and his samgha are residing at present is only empty of elephants, cattle, goats, and so on, but is not empty of the assembly of monks. It is not the case that this place itself or the monks in it do not exist. Nor is it the case that elephants, cattle, goats, and so on, do not exist as entities in other places. Though the Buddha portrays this emptiness as the most inferior kind of emptiness that is to be abandoned, as Mathes (201 lb, 195-96) points out, what is empty and what remains within emptiness in terms of this emptiness and the emptiness as described in texts such as the Madhyàntavibhâga, the Uttaratantra, and R G W differ considerably. Though the wording may appear to be similar in both cases, Mathes says, “there is after all a difference between negating the existence of elephants in a certain place and categorically negating duality. Otherwise, one could also claim that the absence of an inherently existing vase in a dependently arisen vase is inferior emptiness. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Lahkavatarasutra which largely endorses Yogàcâra philosophy intends to dismiss the emptiness of the three nature theory as itaretaraéünyatà.” That is, the negation that elephants exist in a certain place is a very limited negation because it refers to only one particular phenomenon in one particular place, while the general existence of elephants in other places or the exis­tence of other phenomena is not negated. By contrast, the categorical negation of any dualistic phenomena that appear anywhere as a subject or an object or the negation of the totality of adventitious stains in the tathâgata heart are as encompassing forms of negation as can be. The negation of an inherently existing or really established vase in a dependently arising vase is the typical Gelugpa presentation of what is and what is not to be negated, respectively, in Madhyamaka. However, as some Tibetan masters point out, this can also be considered as a case of the inferior emptiness of one being empty of something other or as an inferior form of shentong (“empty of other”), which only pertains to the level of seeming reality since the dependently arising vase is said to exist on that level while being empty of inherent existence. As for emptiness with regard to the three natures, it would be self-contradictory for the Lahkavatarasutra, as a Yogàcâra text, to implicitly refer to the Yogàcâra hallmark of the perfect natures being the dependent nature’s being empty of the imaginary nature as being the worst kind of emptiness that is to be discarded. It is also important in this context to note that the Lahkâvatàrasütms introductory passage to its list of seven emptinesses (Nanjio ed., 74.1-5; D107, fol. 84b.l-2) explicitly says that “emptiness” is a word for the imaginary nature, and that it is because people cling to the imaginary nature that there is a need to speak about emptiness, nonarising, the lack of existence, nonduality, and the lack of nature. By contrast, “the great ultimate emptiness of the wisdom of the noble ones” (paramârthayajhânamahâsünyata) in the Lahkavatarasutra (Nanjio ed., 75.7-9; D107, fol. 85a. 1-2.) is said to be the realization of the personally experienced wisdom of the noble ones and is empty of all latent tendencies of views and flaws. Taking all of this into account, it should be obvious that “the great ultimate emptiness of the wisdom of the noble ones” accords much better with emptiness as presented in the Uttaratantra and R G W than “the emptiness of one being empty of something other.” See also the conclusion of appendix 6."},{"pageNumber":1075,"pageContent":"Notes 10591065.

I generally render vajrapada—lit “vajra foot(ing)”—as “vajra point.” Among the many meanings of pada, those that are relevant here are “footing” (or “basis”) and “word.”1108. Compare the explanation of “vajra” in the Eighth Karmapa’s Lamp (15-16): “The means to generate the actual type of realization of the vajra-like samàdhi are as fol­lows. In the beginning, the minds and mental factors of ordinary beings are made pure through the power of the triad of study, reflection, and meditation. Thereafter, without having to rely on the power of any [element] among the triad of study, reflection, and meditation, but in a self-arisen manner, the vajra-like wisdom of realization is able to overcome the hosts of ignorance right upon the light of wisdom’s meeting them for a single moment at the same time. This is just as the orb of the sun, in a single instant of its shining, roots out completely the darkness of the latent tendencies of ignorance. This is the meaning of ‘vajra,’ and therefore it is [also] the meaning of ‘the seven vajra points’ in the Uttaratantra.” JKC (10-12) explains the following on what the Uttaratan­tra teaches and the meaning of “vajra.” The basis of explanation of the Uttaratantra is the heart of the matter taught by the Buddha, which is that “all sentient beings always possess the tathâgata heart.” Though there are infinite different approaches of explain­ing this by following distinct scriptures, reasonings, and meditations in both India and Tibet, the masters of the Madhyamaka of definitive meaning assert the following. The entirety of the definitive meanings of all three dharma wheels is included in the two kinds of identitylessness. The ultimate meaning of these is the emptiness of the duality of apprehender and apprehended in terms of persons and in terms of phenomena. However, the manner of being empty is not just a nonimplicative negation. Madhyân- tavibhàga 1.20 says:Emptiness here is the nonbeing Of persons and phenomena.The real being of this nonbeing In it is another emptiness.Accordingly, it is the manner of being empty that is an implicative negation—the es­sence of self-lucid self-awareness—that is taught as the tathâgata heart in the context of the Uttaratantra. This is the vajra of the definitive meaning, which becomes threefold through being divided by its phases, as in Uttaratantra 1.47:Its being impure, its being both impure and pure,And its being completely pure, in due order,Are expressed as “sentient being,”“Bodhisattva,” and “tathâgata.”Its phase of not being pure of adventitious stains is described as “sentient being,” and this expanse is also called “disposition” or “the basic element that is the tathâgata heart.” Its phase of possessing both impurity and purity is described as the persons who have entered the path, and from the perspective of isolates, the expanse represents the dharma and the samgha. That is, from the perspective of the isolate that is the mere wisdom of the path of seeing, it is the samgha. From the perspective of the un­interrupted path, it is the path. From the perspective of the path of liberation and its distinctive features, it is cessation. Its phase of being completely pure is described as the Tathâgata and so on, and the expanse is called “dharmakâya.” If this is divided in terms of isolates, it is threefold—awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity. Therefore, through these internal subdivisions, that vajra is also taught as the seven"},{"pageNumber":1078,"pageContent":"io62 Notesvajra points. It is easy to understand that the entire definitive meaning of the two latter dharma wheels is included in it, but you may wonder how the definitive meaning of the first wheel—personal identitylessness—is included in it. The basis of purification, the means of purification, and the result of purification of the inferior paths are all included in the suchness with stains. Therefore, the main topic of this treatise is the tathagata heart, and one should understand that the entirety of the definitive meanings of all three dharma wheels is included in it.1109. Skt. artha can also mean “topic” or “meaning,” as in a meaning and the words that express it. However, as made clear in the preceding sentence, here the term refers to the actual true nature of all phenomena, which is not a semantic, conceptual, or abstract meaning or topic, but something to be perceived directly. GC (20.25-21.6) also makes this very clear, saying that the seven vajra points are very difficult to be understood through study and reflection because these two are conceptual and the actuality of the vajra points cannot be made a direct object of conceptions. Rather, this actuality is the object of what has the nature of the personally experienced direct perception that arises from meditation. Since this actuality is to be personally experienced and thus is inexpressible, it cannot arise right away on the basis of words. However, it still serves as the subject matter of this treatise because this text teaches the cognitions of study and reflection that represent the causes that accord with, and are the path to, attaining what is to be personally experienced. This is similar to expressing the city Pataliputra when saying, “This is the way leading to Pataliputra.” The same is said in Uttaratantra V.16.1110. Sthiradhyasayaparivartasutra, D224, fol. 172b.2-3. VT (fol. 9v.2-3) glosses this pas­sage as the Tathagata s being “unarisen and characterized by unconditioned wisdom.”1111. The Kangyur has the title of this text as Sthiradhyasayaparivartasutra.1112. VT (fol. 9v.3) glosses “this actuality” as “the actuality of the dhatu,” with “dhatu” referring to natural purity and “awakening,” to the purity of being free from stains.1113. This is inserted in accordance with DP.1114. Though Edgerton 1953 and Takasaki 1966a take the term sattvadhatu to mean “mass of beings,” this makes no sense in the context of RGW . Rather, as clearly explained throughout RGW (particularly on 1.48), the AnunatvapurnatvanirdeSaparivarta (see the next sentence in this quote as well as other passages from that sutra on J40 and J41), and the Dharanisvararajasutra (J6), sattvadhatu is an equivalent of tathagatagarbha.1115. Taisho 668, 467a. YDC (243) comments on this quote as follows. “Object” and “sphere” refer to meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, respectively. As for “known, seen, or discriminated,” according to Ngog Lotsawa, this refers to the knowing during preparation, main practice, and conclusion or the knowing during the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization. According to Shang Chokyi Lama, this refers to the knowing through study, reflection, and meditation.1116. D45.48, fol. 269a.l-2.1117.

Schmithausen 1971 suggests to understand the compound avinirmuktajhdna° as vinirmuktatvena jhanam yesam na bhavati (“with which knowing them to be divisible [from the dharmakaya] never happens”). The corresponding passage grol bas shes pa in the SrJmaladevisutra (D45.48, fol. 272b. 1) seems to support that (though it should read ma grol bas shes pa, which is instead found for the afflictions, which are actually realized as being divisible). Schmithausen also suggests a second possibility of reading this compound as vinirmuk- tam jhanam yesam na bhavati (“whose realization is not divisible [from the realization"},{"pageNumber":1079,"pageContent":"Notes 1063of the dharmakâya]”). I follow Schmithausen 1971 and Mathes 2008a in translating “qualities that cannot be realized as being divisible” (which corresponds to how the Srïmàlàdevisütra uses this phrase). However, guna is here in the singular, which seems also how GC (24.15-17) understands it (though taking avinirmuktajhàna to mean “in­separable wisdom”). GC comments that the dharmakaya is endowed with inseparable attributes because they are of the same nature as buddha wisdom. Even at the time of being obscured by the afflictions, it possesses the quality of inseparable wisdom (or the feature of wisdoms being inseparable from it). In brief since the tathâgata heart and its qualities have a connection of identity, the term “kàya” refers to “nature.”1118. Taishô 668, 467a.1119. D185, fol. 187b.4-5.1120. The actual title of this sütra is Tathàgatamahàkarunànirdesasasütra.1121. The actual first chapter of this sütra is called “Array of Ornaments” (rgyan bkod pa zhes bya ba ’dus pa’i le’u; D147, fols. 154a.l—179a.7). However, as we will see, what RG W calls “introductory section” extends into the next section of the sütra, which contains the discussion of the various attributes of bodhisattvas and buddhas, but is not marked as a separate chapter. According to GC (25.10-11) and RYC (6), the fourth vajra point (the basic element) is discussed in the section on the attributes of bodhi­sattvas, while the last three vajra points are found in the section on the attributes of a buddha.1122. D147, fol. 142a.4-5. The last phrase is translated in accordance with the sütra and RG W (DP), while the Sanskrit of R G W has the compound anantasisyaganasuvi- nitah, which is to be read as a bahuvrïhi with the different meaning “[the Bhagavan by whom] limitless assemblies of disciples were superbly guided.” The same phrase is quoted again in R G W and is adapted in accordance with the sütra. However, right thereafter, RGW clearly explains the above compound to mean “[the Buddha] is the one who has superbly guided [disciples] in a progressive manner to the awakening of ¿râvakas and the awakening of buddhas.” Thus, the author of RGW either had a dif­ferent manuscript of the sütra or interpreted this phrase differently.1123. This phrase is missing in MA, MB, and GC, but J adds the compound anuttara- dharmabhânakatvasampannah in accordance with DP and C (which is further con­firmed by the same phrase appearing in CMW, 437).1124. As attributes of the Buddha, this list is also found in the Dhâranïsvararâjasütra, D147, fol. 142a.5.1125. As already mentioned, different from what the sütra says, R G W ’s Sanskrit com­pound anantasisyaganasuvinïtatàm here is to be read as “the fact that limitless as­semblies of disciples were superbly guided [by the Bhagavan].” This is also clear from R G W ’s explanation as to where the Buddha guided his disciples (“the awakening of ¿râvakas and the awakening of buddhas”).1126.

For the identification of these passages in the sütra, see also CMW and Kano 2006, 605-8.1135. C, CMW (447-48), GC (30.9-14), and Ngog Lotsâwa’s commentary (Rngog lo tsà ba bio Idan shes rab 1993b, fol. 16b.2) all confirm that this example comes from the Daiabhùmikasütra. The corresponding passage says: “O sons of the victors, it is as fol­lows. For example, to whichever extent pure gold is heated in a fire by a skilled gold­smith, to that extent it becomes refined, pure, and pliable as he pleases. O sons of the victors, likewise, to the extent that bodhisattvas make offerings to the buddha bhaga- vàns, make efforts in maturing sentient beings, and are in a state of adopting these kinds of dharmas that purify the bhümis, to that extent their roots of virtue that they dedicate to omniscience will become refined, pure, and pliable as they please” (for the Sanskrit, see Mathes 2008a, 505).1136. Skt. vaidürya. Though this term is often rendered as “lapis lazuli” in translations, this is wrong. The Western name “beryl,” chemical formula Be3Al2(Si03)6, derives from Latin beryllus and Greek beryllos, which come from the Prakrit veruliya and the San­skrit vaidürya, which is of Dravidian origin and means “to become pale” (interestingly, the word “brilliance” also derives from beryllus). Originally, this term referred to “a precious blue-green color-of-sea-water stone” (usually some kind of aquamarine) but later became used for the mineral beryl in general. Pure beryl is colorless (which is very rare), but there are many varieties of different colors due to its being mixed with other minerals. Beryl crystals range from very small to several meters in size and many tons in weight. The main varieties are aquamarine (blue), emerald (green), golden beryl (pale yellow to brilliant gold), heliodor (green-yellow), Morganite (pink or rose-colored), and red beryl.1137. VT (fol. 9v5-6) glosses this as kâhjikâdi (kânjika means “sour gruel” or “water of boiled rice in a state of spontaneous fermentation”).1138. VT (fol. 9v6) reads gandikâ (“piece of wood”), which fits with the Dharanisvara­rajasutra and C saying “a piece of wood covered with a cloth.” However, VT gives tiksnarajah (“acid dust”) as its synonym.1139. Skt. mahâbhaisajyarasa, which here seems to refer to mercury (in itself, rasa can also mean mercury, which is used as one of the most potent ingredients in Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicine). As for the three cleansing liquids, Dharanisvararajasutra and DP agree with J on the last one. As for the first two, Dharanisvararajasutra has “alkali” and “caustic mercury,” while DP say “caustic salty water” and “caustic food liquid” (D mistakenly has zangs instead of zas). YDC (330) says that according to Ngog Lotsâwa and Chaba Chôkyi Sengé, the three are “rock salt,” “fish broth,” and “mercury,” while Patsab Lotsâwa speaks of “alkali,” “the three fruits (chebulic, beleric, and emblic my- robalans),” and “sulfur.” Glosses in RYC (17) say “alkali,” “fish broth,” and “mercury or a toxic liquid.” Thus, this cleansing process here begins with an alkaline solution, continues with an acidic one, and ends with quicksilver.1140. These are the three doors to liberation taught extensively in the prajnàpàramità sûtras—the nature of phenomena is emptiness, causes lack any signs or defining char­acteristics, and the appearance of results is not bound to expectations or wishes.1141. VT (fol. 9v6) glosses this as “the discourses of the mahàyàna.”1142. Usually, this means to be free from the three notions of agent, object, and action. However, the Dharanisvararajasutra (D147, fol. 177a.6-7) itself explains this purity of the three spheres as follows: “What is the termination of the three spheres? It is that [state] in which mind does not engage in the past, consciousness does not run after the future, and there is no mental engagement in what occurs at present. Since this is the"},{"pageNumber":1081,"pageContent":"Notes 1065nonabiding of mind, mentation, and consciousness, there is no conceiving of the past, no thinking about the future, and no discursiveness about what occurs at present.” In effect, this means that all eight consciousnesses do not operate in this state (“mind” re­fers to the àlaya-consciousness, “mentation” to the afflicted mind, and “consciousness” to the six remaining consciousnesses). Naturally, mind’s not engaging in the three times as described is reminiscent of similar instructions in the Mahâmudrâ tradition. GC (41.7-11) explains the purity of the three spheres according to Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra XH.llab and its Bhâsya, which comments that this purity is threefold in terms of that through which buddhas teach (speech and words), how they teach (in the form of in­structions and so on), and those who are taught (those who understand through con­cise or through elaborate statements). Thus, GC says that this refers to the pure speech of those who explain the dharma (such as those who are renowned at Nàlandà), the pure dharma to be explained, and the pure mind streams of the disciples.1143. Dhàranîsvararàjasütra, D147, fol. 215b. 1-7. GC (41.11-24) explains “the dharma wheel of irreversibility” as follows. Since wisdom is irreversible on the eighth bhümi, it is called “the bhümi of irreversibility.” This means that before that, some people be­come tired of sitting on a cushion and meditating, thus rising from their cushion as well as from their meditative equipoise. Thus, they do not have poised readiness for med­itative equipoise. On the eighth bhümi, bodhisattvas do not rise from their resting in meditative equipoise in the nature of nonarising. Therefore, it is referred to as “poised readiness for nonarising.” Since it also means being irreversible from unarisen wisdom, the teachings that are primarily given on this bhümi are called “irreversible.” Since they are transferred into the mind streams of disciples, they are called a “wheel,” which con­sists of the Dhàranîsvararàjasütra and the other sütras belonging to this dharma wheel of irreversibility. Those to be guided directly by this dharma wheel are “sentient beings with various causal natures,” with “natures” referring to their dispositions. These sen­tient beings are the results arisen from different dispositions and thus possess them as their causes. This corresponds to the Samdhinirmocanasütra speaking of “those who have entered all yànas.” The fruition of this dharma wheel is “to enter the domain of the tathàgatas”—suchness or the nature of phenomena. Thus, such bodhisattvas realize the true nature of a tathàgata, such as knowing the minds of sentient beings in terms of the true nature of these minds, and, upon having become buddhas, attain the arhat- hood of the unsurpassable yàna. Therefore, they are called “unsurpassable venerable ones” (see also n. 1183 on “irreversible bodhisattvas”). As for the three dharma wheels with respect to the example of cleansing a beryl, GC (42.25-43.2) says that the first one washes away the afflictions that arise from views about a self. The second one purifies coarse and subde thoughts of clinging to (real) entities. The third one purifies what are called “the appearances of objects in the mind” because these are obstructions to seeing the tathàgata heart well. Note that GC (44.20-74.26; Mathes 2008a, 243-304) goes into great detail in establishing the superiority of the third dharma wheel in all respects. The Eighth Situpa, in his introduction to the table of contents of the Derge Kangyur (Chos kyi ’byung gnas 1988, 52-53), says that the three wheels of turning the dharma as presented in the Dhàramsvararâjapariprcchàsütra are the wheel that speaks of revul­sion toward samsàra, the wheel about the three doors to liberation, and the irreversible wheel. As for the rationale behind this division, according to the Uttaratantra (11.41 and 11.57-59), those to be guided enter the path of peace (of sràvakas and pratyeka­buddhas) through first being exhorted by way of the teaching on developing revulsion toward their attachment to samsàra. Then, through speaking about emptiness, they are matured in the mahàyàna. Finally, through the contents of the irreversible wheel, they"},{"pageNumber":1082,"pageContent":"io66 Notesengage in the object of all tathagatas and receive the great prophecy about their own awakening (on the eighth bhümi). The Seventh Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisa­mayälamkära (Chos grags rgya mtsho n.d., 74-84) compares the three turnings in the Samdhinirmocanasütra and the three stages in the Dhâranîévararâjapariprcchâsütra, concluding that the first and second stages match perfectly in terms of both their topics and recipients, while the third ones are not the same. For the wheel of irreversibility in the Dhâranïévararâjapariprcchâsütra corresponds to the teachings on the tathagata heart in general and the third phase explained in the Uttaratantra. The Eighth Karma- pa’s commentary on the Abhisamayälamkära (Mi bskyod rdo rje 2003,1:32-35) agrees with this and elaborates as follows. “The wheel of prophecy” in the Uttaratantra is the dharma wheel that teaches that all sentient beings are endowed with the tathagata heart. It is obvious that Maitreya coined this conventional terminology as a comment on the presentation in the Dhâraniévararâjasütra. As for Maitreya’s third “wheel of proph­ecy” and Nägärjuna’s third “wheel that puts an end to all views,” Karmapa Rangjung Dorje said that these two come down to the same essential point in a general way, in the sense that whatever is the final wheel must necessarily be the wheel that teaches freedom from reference points. However, more specifically, Nägärjunas final “wheel that puts an end to all views” states nothing but sheer freedom from reference points, while Maitreyas final “wheel of prophecy” explains that wisdom free from reference points is the distinctive feature of what is to be experienced by personally experienced wisdom. This is the only difference in terms of these two wheels not representing the same essential point. As for what is of expedient and definitive meaning in the three wheels in the Uttaratantra, the Eighth Karmapa quotes the great Kashmiri pandita Rat- navajra as follows: “The wheel that introduces to the path of peace is the expedient meaning. The wheel of maturation is the wheel that is predominantly of definitive meaning and contains some parts of expedient meaning. The wheel of prophecy is the wheel of nothing but the definitive meaning.” According to the Seventh Karmapa (Chos grags rgya mtsho n.d., 85), in themselves, the Dhâranîévararâjapariprcchâsütra and the Uttaratantra do not explicitly make a distinction in terms of expedient and definitive meaning. However, Asanga’s R G W (J76; D4025, fols. 113b.7-114a.4) states that Uttaratantra 1.155, through saying that the buddha heart is empty of adventitious stains but not empty of being the buddha heart, teaches the unmistaken emptiness by virtue of its being free from the extremes of superimposition and denial. Thus, implic­itly, these texts hold that statements about the buddha hearts being empty (of itself) are of expedient meaning. Ngog Lotsäwas commentary on the Uttaratantra (Rngog lo tsä ba bio Idan shes rab 1993b, fols. lb.2-2a.l) also connects the dharma wheel of irreversibility with the Uttaratantra, saying that the latter explains the true reality of the meaning of the mahäyäna—the intention of the sütras of definitive meaning (the irreversible dharma wheel), which teach the dharmadhàtu as the single principle. The other four Maitreya works, through explaining the meanings of the sütras of expedi­ent meaning, make beings into suitable vessels for this perfect dharma because they present seeming reality as well as the ultimate that is based on the thinking of others. For further details on the three turnings of the wheel of dharma, see Bu ston rin chen grub 1931,2:45-56; Brunnholzl 2004,527-49; Brunnholzl 2010,23-28 and 213-15; and Brunnholzl 2012a, 48-49).1144. CMW (448) says that this verse is from the Lankâvatârasütra. However, this sütra contains only a partly similar verse (X.751; translated from the Sanskrit):The color of gold and the pure gold In gravel become visible"},{"pageNumber":1083,"pageContent":"Notes 10 67Through cleansing it—so it is with the âlaya In the skandhas of sentient beings.The Tibetan version ends with “so it is with sentient beings in the skandhas.” Note also that RGVV’s verse is in Prakrit, while there is no known Prakrit version of the Lahkavatarasutra. The Ghanavyühasùtra (D110, fol. 7b.l-3) also contains averse that corresponds closely to the first three lines of the verse in question:In pulverized stone,Gold does not appear to exist.Through specific cleansing activities,The gold will appear.GC (44.18-19) quotes this verse from the Ghanavyühasùtra and identifies it as the basis of RGVV’s citation. The lines that follow this verse in that sütra say that if one cleanses entities such as the skandhas, dhàtus, and àyatanas, buddha does not exist as an entity. However, that does not mean that buddha is nonexistent—those endowed with yoga see the buddha possessing the thirty-two major marks. Another verse in the same sütra (D110, fol. 13a.5) says:The tathâgata heart Abides like gold in stone.Mentation arises from the âlaya,And so does the mental consciousness.1145. These are discipline, samàdhi, prajnà, and dhâranï (.Dhâranîsvararâjasütra, D147, fols. 159a.6-167b.l). In due order, VT (fol. 9v6-7) glosses them as not harming sen­tient beings, loving-kindness, inquisitiveness, and not lacking recollection. According to GC (75.18-19), these four are called “ornaments” because, just as people delight in ornaments adorning the body, ones retinue takes delight when one possesses these four factors.1146. According to VT (fols. 9v7-10r2), these are the illuminations that consist of (1) mindfulness (not letting previously accomplished virtue be lost and striving for virtue not yet accomplished), (2) insight (into the meaning, not just letters), (3) realization (of all phenomena and the intentions of all sentient beings), (4) dharmas (mundane and supramundane dharmas), (5) wisdom (the characteristics of the wisdom of stream-en- terers up through buddhas), (6) reality (through being in accordance with reality, being disciplined, and attaining all the fruitions such as stream-enterer), (7) the supernatural knowledges (the illumination of seeing due to beholding all forms through the divine eye and so on), and (8) practice (the illuminations of wisdom and prajnà through prac­tice). The Dhâranîsvararâjasütra (D147, fois. 167b.l-171a.l) explains the first seven of the eight illuminations as being eightfold and the eighth one as being ninefold. Accord­ing to GC (76.10), they are called “illuminations” because the entire mahàyàna path is seen through them.1147. These are the ways in which bodhisattvas aspire to teach the dharma in order to eliminate sixteen sets of flaws of sentient beings, beginning with thinking, (1) “I will teach the dharma to sentient beings who are bound by the views about a real personality and are mixed up with various views, in order that they relinquish all their views.” Fur­thermore, bodhisattvas aspire to teach the dharma to sentient beings who (2) entertain the fourfold mistakenness of taking what is impermanent to be permanent, suffering to be happiness, what is without a self to be a self, and what is repulsive to be beautiful, in order that these beings relinquish all these mistakennesses, (3) cling to “me” and what is mine and take nonentities to be entities, in order that these beings relinquish their clinging to “me” and what is mine, (4) are obscured by the five obscurations of"},{"pageNumber":1084,"pageContent":"io68 Notesbeing tormented by desire, having a lot of anger, being attached to dullness and sleep, having regrets about what is not genuine, and not having gained certainty about the profound dharma, in order that these beings relinquish all these obscurations, (5) are attached byway of the six áyatanas, that is, cling to the characteristics of forms, sounds, scents, tastes, tangible objects, and phenomena that they perceive through their six con­sciousnesses, in order that these beings relinquish such attachment, (6) entertain pride (feeling superior to inferior beings), excessive pride (feeling superior to ones peers), overbearing pride (feeling superior to those who are superior to oneself), self-centered pride (claiming everything from form to consciousness as being the self—thinking, “I am all that makes up my existence”), showing-off pride (pride in qualities that one does not actually have), pride of thinking less of oneself (saying, “I am so insignificant com­pared to those great beings” with the implication that one can never reach the greatness of one’s teachers but that one is quite important due to having such teachers), and per­verted pride (pride about a wrong view’s being the correct view or pride about having something that is actually not a positive quality), in order that these beings relinquish all aspects of pride, (7) have entered bad paths and lack the path of the noble ones, in order that these beings relinquish bad paths and make them attain the path of the noble ones, (8) are the slaves of their craving, cling to wives and children, and, due to lacking self-control, cannot judge themselves, in order that these beings have self-control, are able to judge themselves, and are enabled to go where they like to, (9) are in discord with each other and have a lot of anger, hatred, and malice for each other, in order that these beings relinquish their anger, hatred, and malice, (10) are under the sway of evil companions, lack spiritual friends, and commit evil actions, in order that these being are taken care of by spiritual friends and abandon their evil companions, (11) are over­whelmed by attachment, are not content, and lack the prajňá of the noble ones, in order that these beings relinquish attachment and give rise to the prajňá of the noble ones, (12) regard any maturation of karma as nonexistent and dwell in views about perma­nence or extinction, in order to introduce these beings to profound dependent origi­nation and the law of karma, (13) are blinded by ignorance and dullness and cling to a self, a sentient being, a life-force, a life-sustainer, an individual, and a person, in order that these beings purify the eye of the prajňá of the noble ones and relinquish all views, (14) delight in samsara and are in the grip of the executioners of the five skandhas, in order to help them emerge from all three realms, (15) are bound by the fetters that are the nooses of the maras and who dwell in deceit and conceit, in order to liberate these beings from all these fetters and have them relinquish their deceit and conceit, and to (16) those for whom the door to nirvana is closed while the door to the lower realms is open, in order to open the door to nirvana and close the door to the lower realms.

(19) Seeing that sentient beings are under the sway of having fallen into the four rivers and desiring nonvirtue, while they are beyond all these rivers, they establish them in being beyond all these rivers (the four rivers are ignorance, views, becoming, and craving or birth, aging, sickness, and death). The first half of VT (10v2) “[establishing] those who have come through striking with weapons in going beyond all reference points” is strange and probably corrupt (hetyd praharanenagatan sarvopalatnbhasam- atikrame; Nakamura 1992 wants to read hetv-apraharandgatdn sarvopalambham abhi- krame and translates this as “those who are going to give up the cause overcome all thoughts (which are) construed in their mind,” which is not very helpful either).

(28) Seeing that sentient be­ings are separated from the three jewels, while they abide in not interrupting the con­tinuum of the disposition of the three jewels, they introduce them to not interrupting the continuum of the disposition of the three jewels. (29) Seeing that sentient beings deviate from the genuine dharma, while they fully embrace that dharma, they establish them in fully embracing the dharma. (30) Seeing that sentient beings are distant from the precious teacher and lack the six recollections, while they never let go of these rec­ollections, they establish them in cultivating the six recollections (recollecting the Bud­dha, the dharma, the samgha, discipline, giving, and deities; for details, see Brunnhôlzl 2011b, 104 and 270-72).

YDC (295) explains that improper mental engagement, in its coarse form, refers to wrong notions, such as clinging to what is impermanent as being permanent. In its sub­tle form, it consists of all conceptions of dualistic appearances. This improper mental engagement dwells within the luminous nature of the mind, the dharmadhàtu, just like clouds in the sky (see Uttaratantra 1.52-63).1177. In the Yogàcâra system, the typical triad of “mind (citta/sems),” “mentation (manas/ yid)” and “consciousness (vijnàna/rnam shes)” refers to the àlaya-consciousness, the afflicted mind, and the remaining six consciousnesses.1178.

Throughout, both the Uttaratantra and R GW use the terms “afflictions” and “prox­imate afflictions” (upaklesa) as synonyms. This differs from the standard abhidharma use of these terms as specifically referring to the six primary afflictions versus the twenty secondary afflictions. Here, however, the use of upaklesa (lit. “close afflictions”) might indicate the close association of the obscuring cocoon of the afflictions with the tathâgata heart. CMW (481-82) remarks that in the specific context of the change­lessness of the tathâgata heart during the phases of sentient beings and bodhisattvas, R G W on 1.51 speaks of both afflictions and proximate afflictions. According to CMW, “afflictions” in this context refers to the dense afflictions of sentient beings while “prox­imate afflictions” indicates the subtle afflictions of the latent tendencies of ignorance in bodhisattvas.1181. Among the twelve links of dependent origination, the afflictiveness of afflictions cor­responds to ignorance, craving, and grasping, the aftlictiveness of karma to formations and becoming, and the afflictiveness of birth to the remaining seven links. Mipham Rinpoches commentary on the Madhyântavibhàga (’ju mi pham rgya mtsho 1984e, 769.5-770.2) explains that the afflictiveness of afflictions consists of (a) the causes of wrong views, (b) the causes of the three poisons (passion, aggression, and ignorance), and (c) the striving for rebirth. The remedies for (a)-(c) are the realizations of the three doors to liberation—emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, respectively. The afflictiveness of karma consists of the formation of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions. Its remedy is the realization of the door to liberation that is nonformation. The afflic­tiveness of birth consists of (a) being born in a new existence, (b) the minds and mental factors that occur in each moment after having born in that existence up through dying, and (c) the continuum of rebirth (the state of dying, the state of birth, and the interme­diate state). The remedies for (a)-(c) are the realizations of the lack of birth, the lack of occurrence, and the lack of nature, respectively.1182.1 follow MB prajnâyate against J pravartate.1183. In general, “irreversible bodhisattvas” consist of those bodhisattvas on the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization who exhibit specific signs of irreversibility ac­cording to their faculties (those who show signs of irreversibility already on their path of preparation are of highest faculties, those who show such signs on the path of seeing are of medium faculties, and those who show these signs on the eighth bhümi are of lowest faculties). These faculties and their respective signs are discussed in detail in the eighth point (“the signs of irreversible learners”) of the fourth topic (“the complete training in all aspects”) of the Abhisamayâlamkâra (IV.38-59).

However, many Tibetan commentaries count six qualities in Uttaratantra 1.13-18, which are subsumed under the two categories of the qualities of awareness and liberation (just as with the eight qualities of the Buddha and the dharma, these two categories are then counted as two additional qualities of the samgha). The qualities of awareness are (1) the wisdom of suchness, (2) the wisdom of variety, and (3) wisdom’s being internal. The qualities of liberation are (4)-(5) being pure of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations and (6) being endowed with unsurpassable qualities.1196. As Takasaki (1966a, 177n35) points out, C inserts here a verse on the bodhisattva samghas being superior to the éràvaka samgha in ten points (this verse is not contained in DP either, but it may have been present in a different Sanskrit manuscript). Accord­ingly, bodhisattvas are superior in terms of their (1) perception of objects, (2) qualities, (3) attainment, (4) nirvana that is attained after having liberated all beings, (5) bhümis, (6) purity, (7) perfect compassion regarding all beings as equal, (8) birth in the family of tathagatas due to that births being ultimately unborn, (9) perfect masteries, super­natural knowledges, and so on, and (10) unsurpassable fruition of supreme awakening.1197.

In other words, the dharma is nothing but the “body” of the Buddha in that it em­bodies everything that the Buddha realized and taught. This accords with one of the interpretations of what dharmakaya means.1209. Instead of “ultimately,” DP read “ultimate refuge” (don dam pai skyabs) after “ever­lasting refuge” in the text below.1210.

What this means here is that the three jewels possess all these qualities.1214.1 follow Schmithausens reading of MB °sambhavo against J °sargako.1215. As Takasaki 1966a (49-53) points out, chapters 2-5 of the *Anuttaràsrayasütra (only available in Chinese) bear the titles Tathâgatadhâtuparivarta, Tathâgatabodhipari- varta, Tathàgatagunaparivarta, and Tathâgatakriyâparivarta, thus corresponding to the last four vajra points. At the end of each chapter, the sütra discusses the inconceiv­ability of these four topics, with its descriptions being literally the same as in RG W on 1.24-25 (J 21.17-18,22.5,22.8-9, and 24.9-25.3 correspond, respectively, to *Anuttarâ- srayasütra, Taishô 16,470c, 473c, 475c, and 476b-c). Takasaki presents evidence for this sütras having been composed after the RGW, being modeled upon the latter, probably by Paramàrtha.1216. Due to the many different ways in which the term âsrayaparivrtti is used and under­stood in different texts, it is very difficult to translate it in a way that covers all its many applications. In different presentations, the term âsraya (“foundation” or “basis”) can refer to the body, the entirety of ones psychophysical existence (àtmabhàva), the five"},{"pageNumber":1091,"pageContent":"Notes 1075skandhas, the physical or mental impregnations of negative tendencies, the six inner àyatanas, the impure or afflicted dependent nature, the âlaya-consciousness, all eight consciousnesses, adventitious stains, suchness, emptiness, the nature of phenomena, the dharmadhatu, nonconceptual wisdom, the nature of the mind, or tathâgatagar­bha. Parivrtti (“change”) may refer to the removal of something (either the removal of something in something or the removal of this very something) and its being explic­itly or implicitly replaced by something else, the purification of something, the change of something into something else, or the revealing of something without any change within this something through merely eliminating what obscured it (or the very founda­tion within which any of the above “changes” take place, but which remains changeless itself). Thus, the outcome of this process may be something entirely new, a new form of something preexisting, or the unobscured manifestation of what existed primordially. Though some texts do not explicitly specify the result of the fundamental change, others identify it in many different ways, such as the purified dependent nature, the pure ele­ments of the mind stream, stainless suchness, purified emptiness, the uncontaminated dharmadhatu, the dharmakaya, all kinds of masteries (over phenomena, wisdom, and so on), or the tathâgatagarbha endowed with twofold purity (naturally pure and pure of adventitious stains). According to Paramàrthas translations and works (preserved only in Chinese), the fundamental change refers to the change of the âlaya-consciousness into “the pure consciousness” (amalavijñána). In sum, when the àsraya in âsrayaparivrtti is the psychophysical continuum of an ordinary being or the âlaya-consciousness, it is to be removed and replaced by something else, but when it refers to the nature of phe­nomena or buddha nature, it is merely to be revealed just as it is. Thus, more common renderings of âsrayaparivrtti, such as “transformation of the basis” or “revolution of the basis” may be appropriate in certain of the above cases, but when the term applies to the mere revelation of suchness or the tathàgata heart (which is the way in which the term is used in this text), there is no transformation of anything into anything. The only way in which one can speak of a change here is that the state of the tathàgata heart (the foundation) changes from its being obscured to its being unobscured, while there is no change whatsoever in that tathàgata heart itself (similar to space being with and without clouds). Likewise, one cannot really say that, for example, “the alaya-consciousness has transformed,” because the texts usually explain either that the àlaya-consciousness is purified or that it ceases to exist altogether, but not that it is actually transformed into something else. For more details, see the section on “fundamental change” in the intro­duction in Brunnholzl 2012b.1217.

The term samàyukta, fol­lowing the Tibetan translated as “having,” can also mean “encountered,” “joined,” “pre­pared,” and “ready.” Accordingly, this supreme prajňá is a bodhisattva s insight in the last moment of the tenth bhumi that is in fact ready to join with or encounter minds natural luminosity in a single instant, which is equivalent to realizing buddhahood. This kind of prajňá is discussed in more detail in the seventh topic (“the instanta­neous clear realization”) of the Abhisamayàlamkâra (see Brunnholzl 2011b, 105-8 and 272-76 as well as Brunnholzl 2012a, 358-60 and 522-24).1219.

As R G W says just below in the text (follow­ing 1.28), it is precisely according to that sùtra that the three meanings of this phrase will be explained.1236. In the Tibetan editions of the Uttaratantra, this verse follows 1.28, and some editions omit it altogether. JKC (50) notes this fact and says that it does belong to the text since Dolpopa, Karma Kônshôn (a student of the Third Karmapa), Rongtôn, Gô Lotsâwa, and others quote and comment on it extensively.1237. DP and C reverse the order of verses 1.27-28 and insert this sentence between them. For the sake of conforming with the pattern of the respective initial two verses on each one of the three jewels in the text above and the following topics below, Takasaki suggests to insert “What is taught by this?” (anena kim darsitam /) between these two verses.1238. This follows Schmithausen’s suggestion of sadbhâvàrthena for sambhâvârthena. Schmithausen points out that the virtually identical term gotrasadbhâvârtham appears in the text below (J72.8; see the comments on I.149ff.).1239. There are many volumes in Tibet as well as by Japanese and Western scholars on how Uttaratantra 1.28 in general and its compound buddhagarbhâh in particular can be interpreted, so I will highlight just a few points here. As for the somewhat differing San­skrit and Tibetan versions, spharana in 1.28a literally means “quivering,” “throbbing,” “vibrating,” or “penetrating” (the Tibetan here is ’phro ba but khyab pa in the text below in the comments on 1.146). Also, Uttaratantra 11.13, 11.93, and IV.61 use spharana in connection with light rays, and the version of I.28a in Ratnâkarasânti s Sütrasamuccaya- bhâsya (D3935, fol. 297a. 1) says “the illuminating dharmadhâtu radiates” (chos dbyings snang byed ’od ’byung). SM 8b “since the welfare of sentient beings depends on the victor,” which is a reformulation of Uttaratantra I.27a and 1.28a, suggests an interaction"},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"Notes io 77between the dharmakàya of a buddha and the buddha natures of sentient beings. In this vein, an interlinear gloss on verse 11 explicitly relates the twofold dharmakàya—“the utterly stainless dharmadhàtu and its natural outflow (teaching the principles of pro­fundity and diversity)” in Uttaratantra 1.145 (explained by RGVV as “consisting of the arising of [individually] corresponding [forms of] cognizance in other sentient beings to be guided”)—to “the perfect buddhakàya radiates.” Compare also the even more explicit explanation on such an interaction between the dharmakàya of a buddha and the tathàgata hearts of beings in CMW on I.28a (473), which says the following. In order to purify the basic element of sentient beings, with the dharmakàya function­ing as the support, the sambhogakàya and the nirmànakàya perform the welfare of beings through pervading pure and impure retinues, respectively. Therefore, the basis to be purified—the tathàgata heart—exists in all sentient beings. For, if this basis to be purified did not exist in them, their being pervaded by the activity of the three kàyas would be pointless. CMW (480) also says that even those with wrong craving thrive through virtue (the cause for meeting a buddha in the future) because they have the naturally pure disposition. Without this naturally pure disposition, they would not thrive through the light rays of the wisdom of the tathàgatas and virtue. Similarly, YDC (374) answers some objections to enlightened activity by explaining it as the interaction between the dharmakàya of a buddha and the basic element of sentient beings: “‘There is no object for the enlightened activity of awakening to engage because sentient beings are by nature afflicted, similar to the activity of digging for gold’s not engaging anything if there is no gold.’ This is not true—since awakening exists in sentient beings too with­out any difference, it is that in which enlightened activity engages. ‘But if awakening exists in them without difference, enlightened activity does not need to engage it.’ Since it is obscured by adventitious afflictions, just as the sky is by clouds, these must be dis­pelled. ‘Enlightened activity does not have the power to do so.’ It does have that power because it entails great compassion.” In addition, compare Padma Karpo’s explanation of I.28a in appendix 1. See also Ruegg (1969, 273) and Ruegg (1973, 97), who translates spharana in I.28a as “irradiation.” For these reasons, I chose “radiating” for spharana since that English word covers both the meaning of “penetrating” and the sense of the tathàgata heart’s being vibrant with the energy of its natural luminosity (see the example below in this note of violins vibrating). As for vyatibheda in I.28b, rendered as “undifferentiable” above in the text (which corresponds more to Tib. dbyer med), it literally means “pervading.” In the Tibetan, I.28c says “because the disposition exists (yod),” and I.28d ends in can, which literally means “to possess.” However, can is also a common way to indicate a bahuvrihi compound in Tibetan translations from Sanskrit, as is the case here. The two most basic renderings of the Sanskrit of the fourth line with its compound buddhagarbhâh are “all beings are always such that they contain a bud­dha/have a buddha as their core.” Interestingly, in the early Tibetan translations, this line ended in yin (“are”), which was only replaced by can at a rather late point. The most obvious reason for this is to avoid the reading “all beings are the buddha heart,” which is immediately suggested to readers of Tibetan unfamiliar with the underlying Sanskrit. Though I use the word “possess” in I.28d, it is not meant in the sense of sentient beings’ actually owning buddha nature. Nevertheless, especially some later Tibetan (and West­ern) commentators greatly emphasize that beings actually possess the buddha heart or even full-fledged buddhahood. This is denied at length by the Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisamayàlamkâra (see Brunnholzl 2010,438-43). It is also con­tradicted by Uttaratantra 1.27, which explicitly says that the disposition is not the actual buddhahood or dharmakàya—the fruition—but a case of labeling the cause with the"},{"pageNumber":1094,"pageContent":"1078 Notesname of its result. So, one way to look at these two verses is in terms of cause, fruition, and their fundamental equality. In this way, the disposition is the cause for the fruition of the buddhakàya, with suchness indicating that this “cause” is not different from the result (the nature of the mind being always the same in sentient beings and buddhas, or, throughout ground, path, and fruition). This is underlined by Uttaratantra I.142ab: Its nature is buddhakàya,Suchness, and the disposition.As the Eighth Karmapa demonstrates in detail, it is impossible to establish verses 1.27- 28 as strict logical proofs for buddha natures actually existing in all beings or their possessing it (these verses may only serve as indications or metaphors from the per­spective of convenient parlance). This is also highlighted by the fact that in the Tibetan tradition, buddha nature is typically considered as a “very hidden phenomenon,” which by definition does not lie within the reach of inferential valid cognition, but can be ap­proached only through valid Buddhist scriptures. For a selection of Indian and Tibetan that offer more affirmative explanations of the three “proofs” in Uttaratantra 1.27-28, see appendix 1.Without going into further details, I would like to present another more path-ori­ented example that adds to the perspective on the three “proofs,” especially “the bud­dhakàya radiating.” As we saw, the first lines in the three verses 1.27, 1.28, and 1.142 of the Uttaratantra equate buddhakàya, buddha wisdom, and dharmakâya, respec­tively, clearly indicating that the dharmakâya is not just mere emptiness but—as bud­dha wisdom—it actively engages and communicates with sentient beings. This is also clearly suggested by Uttaratantra 1.145, which describes the dharmakâya as twofold: (a) the completely unstained dharmadhàtu and (b) its natural outflow that consists of the teachings of the principles of profundity and diversity—which is used by SM as a gloss of the first line of 1.28. RGW explains that the dharmakaya of buddhas con­sists not only of (a), which is the dharma that represents the sphere of nonconceptual wisdom and is to be personally experienced by these buddhas. The natural outflow of the pure dharmadhàtu (b), which is the cause for attaining (a), consists of the arising of individually corresponding forms of cognizance in the beings to be guided, which is the dharma that is the teaching. This fits with the explanation of line 1.28a in the Eighth Karmapas Lamp (14-15): “At the point when the wisdom of realization—the awareness that exists primordially as not being different from the sugata heart as the expanse—rises from the expanse that is the profound matrix of the sugata heart, all seeds of obscuration are relinquished. The self-awareness of this wisdom of realization is accomplished through the wisdom of the fundamental change of [having gathered] immeasurable accumulations [of merit and wisdom]. You may wonder, ‘How is it ac­complished?’ The cognition that frees from stains [and exists] in the cognizance of sen­tient beings that is associated with obscurations is blessed by the inconceivable power of the wisdom [of a buddha]. In addition, there [also] exists the element of wisdom in the element that is the cognition [of sentient beings] free from stains. It is by virtue of the power of both [the cognition that frees from stains and is blessed by buddha wis­dom and the intrinsic wisdom of sentient beings] that their cognizance fundamentally changes into being without stains, and thus the wisdom of realization becomes of one taste with the dharmakâya.” Later, the Lamp (30-31) says: “That certain [beings] to be guided see these miracles of the body, speech, and mind of the [buddhas] is by virtue of the power of both the tathàgatas’ compassion of blessing, emanating, and transform­ing adventitious seeming [reality] through their having gained mastery over powerful ultimate reality and the tathágata hearts of those to be guided, whose mind streams"},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"Notes 1079are endowed with the tathâgata heart. [Through this,] even ordinary beings are able to realize the miracles of the bhagavàns, the indestructible vajra points.” In addition, as mentioned above, the Sanskrit term spharana for “radiates” literally means “vibrates.” So, as far as the “awakening” of buddha nature in sentient beings is concerned, one may think of both buddhas and sentient beings as violins, with the “buddha violins” being in perfect tunc and playing loudly, clearly, and all the time (teaching the dharma in var­ious ways), while the strings of the “sentient being violins” are covered by a very light cloth. In that situation, the strings of the latter violins will not resound when the former play, but all the strings with the same tuning will at least start to vibrate, even if they are covered by such a light cloth. The less they are covered and the louder the strings of the “buddha violins” play, the stronger they will vibrate, so that the cloth starts moving and gradually slips off the strings, resulting in the strings of the “sentient being violins” gradually resounding louder and clearer too. Likewise, on the path, the more the qual­ities of buddha nature in beings are stimulated and thus “shake off,” so to speak, their adventitious obscurations, the more these qualities manifest fully. In brief, the first line of Uttaratantra 1.28 refers to the “buddha violins” vibrating and the third line to the “sentient being violins.” The fact that the former can actually make the latter vibrate too is shown by the second line, which states (in effect) that their “strings” are indeed of the same nature. For further discussions of Uttaratantra 1.27-28, see appendix 1 as well as Ruegg 1969, 272-86, Mipham Rinpoches Lamp of Certainty (Pettit 1999, 384-87), and Kano 2006.1240. RGW provides an explanation of 1.27-28 in the context of matching the nine ex­amples for buddha nature with its threefold nature of dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition (see 1.143-52).1241. DP have this sentence in a slightly different form (“This topic in all its aspects should be explained through the sense in which it is invariably taught in all the words [of the BuddhaJ”) immediately after verse 1.27 and preceding the above sentence “That is, [he spoke of this] in the sense. . As for “the sense in which it is invariably taught in all the words [of the Buddha],” it seems difficult to ascertain that buddha nature is always ex­plained by way of the following ten topics in the scriptures. However, as mentioned in the introduction, the first six seem to be a rather common template, at least in Yogàcâra texts, in particular in their descriptions of ultimate reality, and RGW (J40) says at the end of the sixth topic that the remaining four topics are simply extensions of the sixth one. GC (330) also states that this template of six topics is found in many texts besides the Uttaratantra (such as the Abhidharmasamuccaya) and explains that the first topic “nature” is the main point to be understood, while the remaining five topics represent the means to understand this first topic. In addition, the Uttaratantra also uses the very same six topics in its second chapter to describe awakening, with the seventh and eighth topics in this chapter being again extensions of the sixth one.1242. Due to the above-mentioned differences in PD, the section after “By virtue of which purport is that [said]?” reads: “1.28.

These three topical points will be taught [in detail] below according to the Tathâgatagarbhasûtra. [Here, I begin with] a synopsis.”1243. Despite the plural “qualities” (sadâvikâritvagunesv) here, the comments in the text below make it clear that this point does not so much refer to the qualities of the tathâgata heart’s being changeless (which is also true), but to its very quality of being changeless. Almost all Tibetan commentaries take “qualities” in DP rtag tu mi gyuryon tan dbyer med ni as relating to the next point, thus speaking of “ever-changelessness, and the inseparability of the qualities.”1244. The compound paramatattvajnânavisayasya (“the object of the ultimate wisdom of true reality”) is a gloss of paramârtha (“the ultimate”) in I.29d. Bhàvivekas Tarkajvâlâ (D3856, fol. 59a.7-59b.2) lists three different ways in which the compound paramârtha can be read in Sanskrit. Artha (“object,” “purpose,” or “actuality”) refers to what is to be understood, realized, or examined, while parama means “supreme.” Thus, (1) since paramârtha is an object and ultimate (or supreme), it is the ultimate object (technically, a karmadhàraya compound). (2) Or it may be read as “the object of the ultimate.” Since it is the object of ultimate nonconceptual wisdom, it is the object of the ultimate (a tat- purusa compound). (3) Or it can be understood as “that which is in accordance with the ultimate object” (a bahuvrihi compound). Since the ultimate object exists in the prajnà that is in approximate accordance with the realization of this ultimate object, it is what is in accordance with the ultimate object. In other words, in (1), both parama and artha refer only to the object as opposed to the subject that realizes it. (2) means that parama refers to the subject (wisdom) and artha to the object (emptiness). (3) indicates a rea­soning consciousness that cognizes ultimate reality not directly but inferentially. Fol­lowing Bhàviveka, the majority of Indian *Svàtantrikas seem to favor the second way of reading paramârtha, while not denying the first. Candraklrti’s Prasannapadâ (D3860, fol. 163b.5-6) explicitly sides with (1). Yogàcàras typically explain the ultimate along the lines of (1) and (2) as being twofold in terms of subject and object. For example, Sthiramatis commentary on Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra VI. 1 (D4034, fols. 74a.3-75b.l) says that the ultimate consists of suchness (the pure dharmadhâtu) and nondual non­conceptual wisdom. Suchness is called the ultimate since it is the fruition of having cultivated the path of the noble ones and represents all phenomena. Or, in terms of its being an object, it is the ultimate because it is the object of ultimate nonconceptual wisdom. Obviously, RGW here explains the term according to (2).1245. J anvaya (lit. “descendant” or “the logical connection between cause and effect”), DP “arises” (byung ba).1246. Respectively, the three points of power, being unchanging, and being moist in 1.31 refer back to the three aspects of the tathâgata heart that were taught in 1.27-28—the dharmakàya’s radiating, the suchness of sentient beings and buddhas being undifferen­tiated, and the disposition existing in all beings.1247. J icchantika, DP ’dod chen. VT (fol. 12r4) glosses this term as “those who desire samsàra.” This term is also used to describe those beings who, according to some, have absolutely no disposition or potential for ever achieving nirvàna or buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":1097,"pageContent":"Notes 1081However, texts such as RGVV take this term to mean that though these beings possess buddha nature just like all other beings, it is so densely obscured that it will take them a very long time to enter the dharma and attain nirvana.1248. VT (fol. 12r4) glosses these people as the Vátsiputriyas. Being a subsect of the Sammitiyas, the followers of Vatslputra (a disciple of Šáriputra) asserted an ultimately real person that is inexpressible as being either the same as or different from the five skandhas. However, it seems quite clear that RGVV refers to the Vátsiputriyas more specifically under (2ab) in the text below, while the persons referred to here seem to be any non-maháyána Buddhists who are averse toward the mahayana (usually denying it to be an authentic teaching of the Buddha). This is confirmed by CMW (456) that identifies the persons in question here as “the Sendhapas [Theravádins] who have fallen into the hinayána” (referring to sectarian non-maháyána Buddhists who oppose the mahayana, with the Theravádins traditionally being the most outspoken such oppo­nents), while explicidy referring to the persons under (2ab) as the Vátsiputriyas. In ad­dition, the hinayána persons in question here are clearly contrasted with šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas by RGVV under (2b), which says that šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas are those “who have entered the means [for liberation]... [and] proceed on the set way of what is rightful.” Thus, contrary to the hinayána followers mentioned here, šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas are obviously seen as those who properly follow the path of the hinayána without denigrating the maháyána.1249.

The second sentence in DP reads: “Šáriputra, they proceed to the great darkness that is even greater than darkness and possesses great darkness.” YDC (280) comments on the Tibetan version of this quote as follows. “Nor are they my šrávakas” corresponds to the statement “How could there be liberation for those whose mind is hostile toward the dharma?” Accordingly, since such people temporarily are not persons to be guided, it is just their being inferior in that way that is expressed through a negative. The darkness that is even greater than ordinary darkness is igno­rance. “Proceeding into great darkness” refers to wandering from suffering into suf­fering. “Possessing great darkness” means possessing both ignorance (the cause) and suffering (its result).1250. Lit. “wanderers.” This term refers to an inhomogeneous group of roaming Yajurveda adepts and performers of Vedic rituals. They may also have had contacts with the early Ayurveda school founded on the Carakasamhita by the famous Indian physician Caraka (born c. 300 bce). VT (fol. 12r4) glosses them as Vaidyas, which here can mean only “those who are experts in medical science.”1251. This is the general name for wandering mendicants of Brahmanic origin, following orthodox Vedic teachings or heterodox paths (the name for mendicants from other castes on heterodox paths, such as the Buddha, was šramaná). Some of these mendi­cants were mere sophists, some Ajlvikas (the followers of Maskarl Gošallputra), but most of them experimented with a wide range of gurus and spiritual methods.

In general, “superior intention” (Skt. adhyaiaya, Tib. lhagpa’i bsam pa) is a term for the superior altruistic attitude of bodhisattvas that has solely the welfare of others in mind. They care about others with the same spontaneous intensity with which ordinary beings usually strive for their own well-being. This attitude is said to be the immediate prerequisite or cause for the arising of uncontrived genuine bodhicitta even in ordinary beings.1259. This group of sentient beings as well as the two following ones were already men­tioned above (J10).1260. J andvaranagdminah.

These ten are mastery over (1) life span (being able to live for infinite eons), (2) mind (firmly dwelling in samadhi through infinite wisdom), (3) necessities (displaying all worldly realms by blessing them with many embellishments), (4) karma (displaying karmic maturations just at the time when they can be blessed), (5) birth (displaying births everywhere in the worldly realms), (6) creative will power (displaying all worldly realms as being completely filled with buddhas), (7) aspiration prayers (displaying awakening in any buddha realm and at any time one pleases), (8) miraculous pow­ers (displaying all kinds of miraculous feats, such as going to all buddha realms), (9) dharma (displaying the light of the dharma doors without center and periphery), (10) wisdom (displaying a buddha’s powers, fearlessnesses, unique qualities, major and mi­nor marks, and becoming completely perfecdy awakened). Usually, it is said that these ten masteries are attained on the eighth bhumi. However, even bodhisattvas on the lower bhumis possess certain degrees of such masteries.1269. RYC (70) explains that “the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance” refers to the latencies of being ignorant in terms of a phenomenal identity.

DP and C have “body” for Sanskrit dtmabhava, which is one of its meanings. The term (lit. “becoming or existing of one’s self’ or “produced by one’s self’) can also refer to the entirety of one’s psychophysical existence as related to a self. The three kinds of mental bodies mentioned here are those assumed by ¿ravaka arhats, pratyekabuddha arhats, and bodhisattvas, respectively.1271. These are usually listed as desire, (wrong) views, holding (wrong) discipline and spiritual disciplines as paramount, and proclaiming a self (atmavada). VT (fol. 12r7) lists them as extreme views (drstanta), the appropriating factor of conception (kalpopadana), the appropriating factor of (wrong) discipline and spiritual disciplines (,iilavratopadana), and the appropriating factor of existence (bhavopdddna).

The other three wheels are the accumulation of merit, a favorable dwelling place, and proper vows and aspirations. Note that this a case of R G W ’s using the term “dis­position” (gotra) not in its usual sense of unconditioned buddha nature but with its other meaning of conditioned virtue. This latter meaning of the term is found fre­quently in other mahäyäna texts in general and Yogäcära works in particular (such as the Mahäyänasüträlamkära).1300.1 follow MB °jnänarasmayah and DP ye shes kyi ’od zer against J °rasmayah.1301.

That is, these persons are actually able to attain nirvana at some point in the distant future. This represents a typical case of “the intention with regard to another time,” one of “the four intentions” (Skt. abhisamdhi, Tib. dgongs pa) of the words of the Buddha (these four are explained in Mahäyänasüträlamkära XII.16fF. and its commentaries). Among them, (1) the intention in terms of equality means to take the three equalities between all buddhas in terms of the accumulations of merit and wisdom, the dhar­makaya, and the welfare of beings accomplished by them as the reason for the Buddha’s saying something like “At that time, I was the Tathagata VipaSyi.” (2) The intention in terms of another meaning means to take the threefold lack of nature of the imaginary, dependent, and perfect natures in terms of characteristics, arising, and the ultimate, respectively, as the reason for the Buddha’s saying something like “All phenomena lack a nature.” (3) The intention in terms of another time means to take the time in the far future when a certain person will actually be born in Sukhävatl as the reason for the Buddha’s saying something like “If you make the aspiration prayer to be born in Sukhavati, you will be born there.” (4) The intention in terms of the thinking of a per­son refers to something like the Buddha’s disparaging discipline and praising generosity by intending to make persons who content themselves with discipline alone engage in other means, such as generosity, too. In addition, there are “the four indirect inten­tions” (Skt. abhipräya, Tib. Idem dgongs). Just like the Sanskrit and Tibetan words, the English term “intention” can be understood in many ways (see Ruegg 1985), which has led to different (mis)interpretations. Also, the Tibetan terms are often used in different"},{"pageNumber":1101,"pageContent":"Notes 1085ways than the Sanskrit ones. As the examples for the different kinds of intention and indirect intention show, there is no consistency in what they refer to—it is not always just another meaning (as the content of an intention) or an intention per se, and there also are overlaps. In a general sense, “having something particular in mind” when mak­ing a statement often seems more correct. For details, see Broido 1984, Ruegg 1985, and Brunnholzl 2010, 289-91.1304. As already mentioned, according to Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye’s commentary on the Third Karmapas Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart (Kong sprul bio gros mtha’ yas 1990, 133), this verse is from the Abhidharmamahàyànasütra. As for the question whether the Yogàcàra School teaches that some beings have no disposition to attain awakening at all (and what exactly “disposition” means in this context), there have been long-standing and intricate debates in Tibet. The Gelugpa School in particular answers this question in the affirmative and many modern scholars do so too. As mentioned before, unlike the primary meaning of the term gotra in the Uttaratantra, in Yogàcàra texts it is not synonymous with buddha nature. Like the Lahkàvatàrasütra, the Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra speaks about five categories of gotra (those of bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, sravakas, those with uncertain gotra, and those without gotra). The Lankâvatàrasùtra identifies the last category with those who just follow their great de­sire (icchantika) and reject the dharma, thus having eliminated all their roots of virtue and not attaining parinirvâna. The Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra follows this very common definition of gotra in general, which is “roots of virtue” (see also Sthiramatis Madhyàn- tavibhâgatïkà, Yamaguchi 1934, 188). Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra III.4cd and its Bhâsyâ explain that gotra is that from which qualities arise and increase. Also the distinction between the naturally abiding (prakrtistha) and the accomplished (samudânïta) or un­folding dispositions in this verse differs from how these terms are understood in the Uttaratantra, with the formers being defined as what has the nature of being a support for further virtue (prakrti can also mean “cause”) and the latter as what is thus sup­ported. On Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra III.9 and III.ll, the Bhdsya comments that accu­mulating roots of virtue is indispensable for acquiring a disposition, but once the bodhisattva disposition is acquired, it serves as the source of an infinite number of further roots of virtue. Thus, gotra in this sense refers to conditioned and multiple phenomena, whereas gotra in the sense of buddha nature is clearly unconditioned and single. The former sense is also evident from Sthiramatis commentary (D4034, fols. 41b.6-43a.2), which says that beings have infinite gotras, all of which refer to some (conventional) nature of theirs, such as being an angry or passionate person, or liking sweet versus other tastes. Just as the possession of the gotra of desire functions as the cause for giving rise to desire but not for hatred, the three different gotras of the three yànas are indispensable for there being three yanas. As for Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra III. 11, the Bhasya explains that to be without disposition means to possess the nature of not attaining parinirvâna—either for a certain time (the first four kinds of beings in the verse) or forever (the last one). According to Sthiramatis commentary (D4034, fols. 48a.4-49b. 1 ), this refers to those who have the nature of not attaining parinirvâna (that is, buddhahood) for a certain time and those who have the nature of not attaining any kind of nirvana for a certain time. He says that the first four pertain to those who do possess the bodhisattva disposition, but, by virtue of certain conditions, will temporar­ily (for many eons) not attain parinirvâna (that is, buddhahood). Among these, “those who are solely devoted to wrongdoing” are engaged in the five negative actions without interval. “Those who have completely destroyed the immaculate dharmas” are those who, under the influence of wrong spiritual teachers, have fallen into the wrong view"},{"pageNumber":1102,"pageContent":"io86 Notesof nihilism, thus denying karma, the three jewels, and so on. “Those who lack the virtue conducive to liberation” have not gathered the complete accumulations of merit and virtue necessary to attain parinirvâna, but only the virtues for higher rebirths as gods and humans within samsara. “Those who have inferior immaculate dharmas” have only gathered a fraction of the merit and wisdom necessary to attain parinirvâna. Thus, as long as these four do not fully remove their negative actions and wrong views and accu­mulate the complete accumulations of merit and virtue necessary to attain parinirvâna, they will not attain this state. As for those who will not attain any nirvâna, “lacking the cause” refers to lacking the roots of virtue and the disposition for any of the nirvânas of the three yànas because without such a disposition, they do not attain any of these three nirvânas. They do lack the nature of attaining nirvâna, just as the natures of stones and trees do not turn into something that has the nature of consciousness, such as minds and mental factors. Thus, in the first four cases, Sthiramati says, “lack of dis­position” has only a pejorative sense, while “lacking the cause” means utter nonexis­tence because they absolutely do not attain nirvâna. However, considering the texts (and the commentators’) understanding of “disposition” (roots of virtue), its explicit stance that all beings possess tathâgatagarbha (IX.37), and its statement that mind is natural luminosity, which is merely obscured by adventitious stains (XIII. 18-19), being without gotra (agotraka; the text does not use icchantika) forever is not equivalent to saying that some beings have no buddha nature or absolutely can never attain awaken­ing. Rather, there are some beings who simply never acquire a “disposition” for actually entering any of the yànas in the sense of never acquiring any—or at least a significant— amount of virtue that qualifies as such a disposition (on the Sanskrit atyantam being used here in the temporal sense of “forever” rather than in its meaning “absolutely” and the consequences, see also d’Amato 2003, 126-27 and 132-35). In other words, all be­ings have the potential for buddhahood, but some just never actualize this potential even remotely, which is exactly why samsàra in general is said to be endless. This is basically also what RG W on 1.40-41 explains, using the term gotra in both the above way and also for buddha nature. Sthiramati’s Madhyântavibhâgatïkâ (Yamaguchi 1934, 55.19-56.6) on 1.19a (“the emptiness of the primordial nature” among the sixteen emp­tinesses) juxtaposes the positions on there being three versus a single gotra, but takes all of them to be primordial: “As for [I.19a] ‘In order to purify the disposition,’ its empti­ness is the emptiness of the primordial nature. The reason for this is that, [according to the Bhâsya,] ‘disposition is the primordial nature.’ How so? ‘Because of having a nature of its own,’ which means to have a nature of its own from beginningless time that is not adventitious. Just as some [phenomena] in beginningless samsàra are sentient and some are insentient, here too, some [sets of] the six àyatanas represent the buddha disposition, some the àràvaka disposition, and so on. The disposition is not accidental because it has been continuing since beginningless time [up through the present], just as the distinction between what is sentient and insentient. Others say that since all sen­tient beings are endowed with the tathâgata disposition, the disposition should be un­derstood here in this way” (depending on how the Sanskrit here is reconstructed, “in this way” could also be read as “as suchness,” which would conform to the above-men­tioned comments by Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, and Asvabhâva on Mahàyàtiasùtràlam- kâra IX.37). Compare also CMW (480-81) that says that even those with great desire thrive through virtue (the cause for meeting a buddha in the future) because they have the naturally pure disposition. Without this pure disposition, they would not thrive through the light rays of the wisdom of the tathâgatas and virtue. This is not contradic­tory to some sutras’ explaining that seeing samsàra as a flaw and nirvâna as a quality"},{"pageNumber":1103,"pageContent":"Notes 1087does not occur in those with great desire, who have the disposition of absolutely not passing into nirvana. For that explanation pertains to the time of those with great de­sire not being endowed with the four wheels, whereas at the time of their being struck by the light rays of the wisdom of the Tathagata, their time of being endowed with the four wheels has come. GC (33.17-21) explains that “being without gotra” refers to being without the unfolding disposition, which is not made explicitly clear in the Lahkä- vatärasütra. However, it is not just the sheer lack of the unfolding disposition that is called “disposition.” Rather, the mere fact that everybody has the naturally abiding dis­position does not mean that no one lacks the unfolding disposition. Since everybody who possesses a mind also possesses the naturally abiding disposition, they are said to possess the disposition. However, some Yogäcäras take the statement that some beings have no disposition literally.1305. The translation follows Schmithausen’s suggestion to understand °gunayuktasva- bhävatah as a predicative ablative that qualifies “disposition of the victors” (jinagar- bhah) in I.45c. Takasaki 1966a. (400fF.) already pointed out that verses 1.30, 35, 42, and 45, though interrupted by several commentarial verses, are to be considered as a unit, with jinagarbhah in I.45c being the subject that is common to all four verses. As mentioned above, the six topics of nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment, and manifestation in these four verses are described in a similar way in verses IX.56-59 of the Mahäyänasüträlamkära (which are also found as concluding verses in the Bud- dhabhümisütra), where they pertain to the purity of the dharmadhätu as the common subject. As for Takasaki’s different rendering of I.42cd (“because of its nature of being endowed with properties indivisible [from it]”), it seems to correspond exactly to DP dbyer med yon tan dang Idan pa’i / ngo bo nyid phyir.1306. This is how DP mthu bsam gyis mi khyab pa’i yon tan dang Idan pa unravels the compound acintyaprabhävagunayoga (other possible readings are Takasaki s “endowed with inconceivable and powerful virtues” or “endowed with inconceivable power and qualities”).1307.

However, as Schmithausen remarks, RGW interprets vrtti as pravrtti in the sense of the more or less unmistaken ways in which ordinary beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas engage the tathagata heart. Besides “man­ifestation” and “engagement,” both terms can also mean “behavior,” “activity,” and “function.” Further meanings of vrtti include “mode of being,” “nature,” “state,” and “condition,” while pravrtti can also mean “advancing” and “cognition.”1319.

The references to the number of verses about the changelessness of buddha nature in each one of its three phases are rather confusing here since the twelve verses 1.52-63 on the phase of its being impure are followed by two further verses (1.64-65) that elaborate on them. The one verse about its phase of being both impure and pure is then 1.66, which is followed by twelve more explanatory verses (1.67-78). Finally, the one verse about its phase of being completely pure is 1.79, again followed by four commentarial verses (1.80-83).1330. This refers to the ancient Indian cosmological model of worlds arising in space due to the four elemental spheres of wind, fire, water, and earth being stacked up in that order and thus supporting the upper spheres. As VT (fol. 13rl) confirms, the element of fire is not mentioned among the four elements in this text because fire is used to illustrate sickness, aging, and death, which destroy one’s prior state of existence.1331.

Though the reading of Takasaki and DP is less likely, it could refer to the explanation just below in the Sagara- matipariprcchasutra that bodhisattvas on the bhumis deliberately retain weak forms of the afflictions, in particular, desire, (the causes of birth and so on) in order to be able to be reborn in samsara to help sentient beings. However, these retained latencies of desire do not have the power to afflict the mind streams of such bodhisattvas, nor can they cause involuntary rebirth in samsara. Still, they retain a connection to the beings in samsara. Another way to say this is that the most refined form of passion is the passion to free sentient beings, which is nothing other than the great compassion of bodhisattvas."},{"pageNumber":1106,"pageContent":"1090 Notes1352. For lines I.67cd, I follow Schmithausen. However, the commentary interprets jâtih as “birth” and takes suffering to be a result of birth, which is in turn caused by karma and afflictions (thus taking these lines to mean “They lack this [suffering] because they lack being born through the power of karma and afflictions”).

Overwhelmed by his fatherly love for him and the worry about his well-being, the man does not enter the city, but returns to fetch his son in order to provide its pleasures for him too. What follows in our text here is the explanation of the meaning of this example. VT also mentions this example here and says that the father stands for bodhi­sattvas, while his only son exemplifies all sentient beings.1375. Ibid., fol. 242a.5-7. The passage in “[ ]” is from this sutra (de snying rje chen po’i sems skyes nas sems can thams cad yongs su bskyab pai phyir zagpa zad pa’i ye shes ’dris par byas pa las sems can mams la Ita bas phyir phyogs te / slar log nas so so’i skye bo’i sa na yang kun du snang ngo /). It seems that both the Sanskrit and DP are missing something here since the first part of this paragraph up through “in order to protect all sentient beings” is clearly an (unfinished) quotation, while the remainder is a further explana­tion of this quotation.1376. DP “unattached” (chags pa med pa) instead of “unobstructed” (thogs pa med pa).1377.

Rather, it is to be connected with the fact that bodhisattvas do not enter this wisdom fully, but return to samsara in order to help sentient beings.1378.

The minds of bodhisattvas"},{"pageNumber":1108,"pageContent":"1092 Noteson the eighth bhümi effortlessly engage in accomplishing the welfare of beings, just like a fire naturally burns up dry firewood. They also rest continuously in a meditative equipoise in which all characteristics have subsided because they have gained mastery over nonconceptual wisdom by virtue of the fundamental change of the afflicted mind. Bodhisattvas on the tenth bhümi effortlessly and spontaneously accomplish the mat­uration of sentient beings. The distant cause of this is the power of their previous aspiration prayers up through the ninth bhümi that they may be able to effortlessly accomplish the welfare of others. The close condition is that they are free from all con­ceptions of characteristics. From the perspective of the world, the manner in which bodhisattvas during the subsequent attainment of the tenth bhümi mature sentient beings is equal to that of buddhas in terms of liberating beings from samsara. However, in terms of their own welfare, they are not equal to buddhas—their realization and re­linquishment compared to those of buddhas is like the amount of water in a hoofprint versus the amount in the ocean because they still have certain obscurations and seeds of latent tendencies. Also, in their accomplishing the welfare of others, they are equal to buddhas in terms of their enlightened activity’s being effortless, being uninterrupted, and manifesting in all kinds of ways. However, they are not equal to buddhas in ac­complishing the welfare of others in all respects because they are not able to confer the empowerment of great light rays that only buddhas can bestow.1388. Takasaki translates “because it is endowed with inexhaustible properties” (Skt. aksyadharmayogatahy DP mi zad chos Idan phyir)y which is also how Tibetan commen­taries usually interpret this phrase. However, the parallel construction of lines a, c, and d in the quote from the Anünatvàpürnatvanirdesa]sütra in the text below that teaches the same meaning as 1.79 (as well as line d in the additional verse in DP) shows that dharma is to be understood as “nature” here too. Moreover, it makes more sense to say that the tathâgata element is permanent and unchanging because it has the nature of being inexhaustible rather than because its qualities are inexhaustible (which is also true but seems not to be the point here).1389.

According to C, this quote is from a Sadâyatanasütra or Sadindriyarâiisütra (nei­ther the Pâli, nor the Tibetan, nor the Chinese canons contain sütras of that name). Both the Pâli and the Chinese canons contain the Salâyatanavibhangasutta (Majjhima Nikâya 137), Mahàsalâyatanikasutta (Majjhima Nikâya 149), and Safâyatanasamyutta (Samyutta Nikâya 35), but none of them contains this passage. It is however found in the Bodhisattvabhümi (Wogihara ed., 3.4-6; D4037, fol. 2b.4) and, almost identically, in the Sràvakabhümi (D4036, fol. 2a.2-3).1400. There is a partly similar passage in the Érîmâlâdevîsütra (D45.48, fols. 272b.7-273a.l).1401. D100, fol. 283a.3.1402. Taishó 668,467a.1403. D45.48, fol. 269a.2-3.1404. Ibid., fol. 272a.2-5.1405.

Modern scholars usually do not consider this verse as part of the Uttaratantra but as part of RGW . That this verse is not part of the Uttaratantra but a quote from some other text is suggested by the fact that it is followed by iti in the Sanskrit of R G W and by the corresponding zhes bya ba in DP. By contrast, such is never the case for any of the verses of the Uttaratantra in RGW ”. Still, RGW provides some comments on this verse (as it does with certain other verses not from the Uttaratantra) and in its explanation of 1.88-92. Maybe due to that or based on a different manuscript, Ut (DP) and all Tibetan commentaries consider this verse to be part of the Uttaratantra. For further comments on it, see CMW (491-92). According to C, this verse is from the Mahâparinirvânasütra, but, as Takasaki already remarks, it is not found there. Maybe C was referring to a partly similar passage in that sütra: “This [nirvàna] is liberation. Liberation is the experience that is most everlasting, immovable, blissful, and perma­nent. What is this liberation is the Tathâgata” (D120, fol. 78a.l). The Angulimâlïyasütra (D213, fol. 189a.2) also contains two similar lines: “What is nirvàna is liberation. What is liberation is the Tathâgata.”1408. D45.48, fol. 264a.5.1409. Ibid., fol. 264a.5-264b.2.

As Takasaki does, this could also be read as “have inseparable qualities” (which is also true), but, as already explained at length, the point here is that buddhahood and nirvána are inseparable.1411. This example is from the Ratnacüdapariprcchâsütra (D45.47, fol. 221a.6-221b.4).1412. Skt. pratišrutya can also mean “to hear” or “to promise.”1413. VT (fol. 13vl) glosses tadâkârâ as sunyatâkàrâ, which relates to the other pàramitàs, thus reading “the painters are said to be generosity... and so on, which have the aspect of that [emptiness].” DP de mams is obviously a misprint of de mam as the equivalent of tadâkârâ.1414. DP add a fifth line de la mngon par sbyin mams kyis between 1.92c and I.92d, but Tibetan commentaries usually omit it too.1415. I follow MA/MB anutpattikadharmatà0 (confirmed by DP mi skye ba’i chos nyid) against J anutpattikadharma0 (“the dharma of nonarising”), though the latter is more common as a synonym for emptiness.1416. DP “hundreds of thousands” (brgya stong).1417. Beyond R G W ’s own brief comments on “the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects,” see appendix 4 for more details. GC (386.22-388.26) explains that, in the ex­ample of the painters, the canvas symbolizes the tathàgata heart, which has the char­acteristic of emptiness; the king, all buddhas; the kings order, the twelve branches of the words of the buddhas; the painters, generosity and so on; the image of the king, the emptiness that is endowed with all supreme phenomena that are the fruitions of the means in their fully complete forms; and the painters receiving the canvas, the realiza­tion of the tathàgata heart due to the words of the buddhas. Since all phenomena that are the means are included in the six pàramitàs, the coarse elements of this form of emptiness are complete in them. Prajňá is like the head because all knowable objects are viewed through the eye of superior insight. Vigor is like the hands because it collects all virtuous phenomena. Dhyàna and discipline are like the feet because one proceeds on the path with these two. Generosity is like the rich flesh of the body because it creates wealth. Patience is like the hue of the body because it beautifies. Here, the actual image of the king stands for the dharmakàya because it is inseparable from the canvas of the tathàgata heart. The reflection of this image on the canvas in a mirror represents the two rüpakàyas, which thus are only the nominal forms of a buddha. The factors of the means during the phase of the path (which resemble the painters) are the causes for making the image of the dharmakàya clearly manifest. Therefore, they are the coop­erative conditions, while the substantial cause is nothing but the suchness with stains. What is to be made clearly manifest through these means are the qualities that abide in the basic element with stains and surpass the sand grains in the Gafigà in number. Thus, RGW says that the four features of these qualities—being of all kinds, being innumerable, being inconceivable, and being stainless—are, in due order, attained on the eight bhûmi up through the buddhabhümi. However, this is only said in terms of what is primary, but all these four features of the qualities exist already on the eighth bhümi. This is similar to matching the ten pàramitàs with the ten bhümis by saying that generosity is the primary pàramità on the first bhùmi and so on, while in fact all ten pàramitàs exist on each bhùmi. According to GC, RGVV’s phrase “the samàdhi of the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects” refers to the wisdom of the pure bhumis that is endowed with all aspects of qualities. “The door of that” consists of hav­ing terminated flaws through prajňá and having collected all factors of means through"},{"pageNumber":1111,"pageContent":"Notes 1095compassion. Through having cultivated these, on the eighth bhümi, bodhisattvas attain the dharma of nonarising. Therefore, the effortless operation of nonconceptual wis­dom from the eighth bhümi onward is attained through the preceding cultivation of the path that entails effort up through the seventh bhümi.1418. Based on DP mam pa, I follow Takasaki’s emendation of kâranena to âkàrena.1419. DP omit “prajñá.”1420. With DP (chags pa med pa thogs pa med pdi ye shes kyi gzigs pa mnga ba’i de bzhin gshegspa), I take asañgápratihataprajñájñanadarsanam as a bahuvrihi compound qual­ifying tathâgatatvam.1421. DP replaces “phenomena” with “prajñá.” D45.48 omits this sentence.1422. D45.48, fol. 267a.2-4. The words in “[ ]” are added from D45.48.1423. These nine examples stem from the Tathàgatagarbhasütra (D258, fols. 248a.3-254b.3).1424.1 follow MA tusesu sârâny against J tusesu sârâny.1425. DP “lowly” (ngan ma).1426. Skt. prnni (lit. “living beings” or “animals”).1427. With Schmithausen, I follow MA °strtrüpa° against J °striduhkha° and take °jva- lanâbhitaptaprthivïdhâtu0 as a unit, which is also confirmed by VT (fol. 13v2) that relates jvalanâbhitaptam to prthivïdhâtuh, saying that jvalanâbhitaptam refers to heated gold and prthivïdhâtuh to the earth that covers that gold. However, DP read “a lowly woman tormented by the blaze of suffering, and the element of earth” (sdug bsngal ’bar bos mngon pargdungs pdi bud med sayi khams).1428. I follow Schmithausen in linking °vimalaprakhyah with sa dhàtuh parah and not with °ratnabimba° (“precious statue” in VI.98d). DP read “the stainless supreme basic element resembles ...” (dang dri med khams mchog mtshungs pa nyid).1429. In the Tathàgatagarbhasütra, this example occurs twice. The introduction of the sütra describes in detail how the Buddha miraculously manifests in the sky thousands of fragrant opened lotus flowers with buddhas sitting upon them, emitting light. These lotuses blossom and fade at the same time, exuding a foul smell, but the buddhas still remain within them without a stain. In the sütra’s section of the nine examples proper, this example is presented as it is here in the Uttaratantra. For details of the differ­ences between the nine examples as presented in the Tathàgatagarbhasütra and the Ut­taratantra, see Zimmermann 2002,105-44.1430. With Schmithausen, I follow MA suvarnam asminn idam agraratnam (supported by DP ’di na yod pdi gser / rin chen mchog ’di) against suvarnam asmin navam agraratnam in J and MB.1431. DP read “virtuous” (dge ba) for subha, which can also mean “beautiful,” “pleasant,” “good,” “auspicious,” “prosperous,” “pure,” and “eminent.”1432. DP ’thon.1433. It may seem that this example suggests a growing process of the tathâgata heart, just as a germ or a sprout gradually grows into a tree, which entails the need for supporting conditions such as water and sunlight. However, as Zimmermann (2002,62-64) shows, the explanation of this example in the Tathàgatagarbhasütra does not understand this to be the primary thrust of the example but rather emphasizes the imperishable nature of the seed and the fact that the result (the tree) is already contained in the seed, both being of the same nature. Also, conditions such as virtue do not produce buddhahood but only serve as conducive factors for its revelation. The same goes for the simile of a cakravartin in the womb of a poor woman. The emphasis is on the nature of a cakra- vartin s being unchanging, whether still being in the womb or being a grown-up person, while the growth process of the embryo is not discussed. The stress lies on the stark"},{"pageNumber":1112,"pageContent":"1096 Notescontrast between the destitute and ugly woman and the glory of the cakravartin king inside her. In addition, the terminology (such as sugatakaya, tathagata, tathagatadhdtu, and dharmata) used in the explanation of these two examples is the same as in all the other examples and does not suggest any kind of growing or ripening process. That is, the Tathdgatagarbhasutra throughout presents the model of the tathagata heart with its qualities being revealed as opposed to any kind of gradual development. As Zimmer- mann (2002, 86-87) suggests, the reformulation of the example of the germ growing into a tree in the Uttaratantra could have been due to the concern that the original ex­amples statement that the result (the tree) is already present in the seed comes too close to the position of satkaryavada as espoused by the Samkhya School, which is usually rejected by Buddhists as a form of eternalism. That such a concern was definitely present among at least some readers and commentators of the Uttaratantra is evident from the long-lasting and sometimes vicious debates in Tibet about whether a literal understand­ing of the teachings on buddha nature means falling into a Hinduist view.1434. In the Tathdgatagarbhasutra, a man traveling on a dangerous path would wrap his golden buddha statue in a tattered garment to hide it from the sight of robbers, but then the statue in that garment would fall by the roadside until someone with the divine eye picked it up and paid homage to it.1435. Skt. atmabhdvam, DP dngos po nyid. As mentioned above, in the Tathdgatagar­bhasutra (D258, fol. 253a. 1-2), the Buddha says that a tathagata s body like his own dwells in all sentient beings, even in animals.1436.

Against Takasaki and DP (rnam par smin pa bzhin) understanding °vat in vipäkavat as “like,” I follow de Jong’s suggestion of taking vipäkavat as a possessive adjective re­lating to jnänam Thus, the nonconceptual wisdom mentioned here seems to refer to the wisdom on the last three bhümis that emerges from the stains of the preceding seven bhümis, just as an embryo emerges from the womb.1452.

This means that the Buddhas words or scriptures are not regarded as outer matter, but as nothing but mental appearances, that is, the aspects of a being’s mind that ap­pear—under the influence of a buddha’s dharmakaya—as the objects of the subjective cognitive aspect of that mind. This notion is commonly found in Yogäcära texts and, in particular, many commentaries on the Abhisamayälamkära. For example, Sthiramati s Madhyäntavibhägatikä (Pandeya ed., 1999, 4.7-10; D4032, fol. 190a.4-5) explains the nature of a treatise (Skt. sästra) as follows: “A treatise consists of the cognizances that appear as the collections of names, words, and letters. Or a treatise consists of the cog­nizances that appear as the special sounds (or terms) that cause one to attain supramun­dane wisdom. How do cognizances guide one or express [something]? The cognizances of the listener arise due to the cognizance of the guide and explainer” (for variant read­ings of this passage in D4032 and Pandeya 1999, see note 1875). Haribhadra’s Abhisa- mayälamkärälokä (Wogihara ed., 7) states about the scriptural prajfiäpäramitä, “This teaching [of prajfiäpäramitä], on the level of the seeming, has the character of cogni­tion’s appearing as words and letters.” Compare also the Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisamayälamkära (Brunnholzl 2010, 23 and 33), which defines the dharma wheel of scriptures as “the cognizance of a disciple that appears either in the form of a buddha’s speech, whose main topics are either the causes, the results, or the nature of nirväna, or, the cognizance that appears as the collections of names, words, and letters that serve as the support for such speech” and the scriptural prajfiäpäramitä as “the cognizance that appears as assemblies of names, words, and letters, and is suitable to be observed in the disciples’ consciousnesses that entail dualistic appearances.”1455.

The Sanskrit anda (“egg”) is hard to make sense of here (it is probably used in anal­ogy to andakosa in I.136d, but the result would still be a mixed metaphor of a kernel in an eggshell). Therefore, I follow the Tibetan sbubs (corresponding to kosa). However, given the previous example of one taste, C’s reading “kernels of different tastes” also makes good sense.1457. It could be argued that dhâtu here takes up that term as it is used in 1.146c and else­where, where it clearly refers to the basic element of sentient beings. See however the next sentence in which dhâtu means “realm.”1458. IX. 15 (the translation follows the Sanskrit of the Mahâyânasütràlamkàra\\ RG W has a few slight variations). This verse is the fourth of six verses in the Mahàyânasûtrâlamkàra (IX. 12-17) that explain buddhahood as being “the fundamental change.” According to Sthiramati’s Sütrâlamkàravrttibhâsya (D4034, fol. 113b.5-117a.6), IX.12 states that this fundamental change is endowed with the supreme qualities of the pure dharmas (mirrorlike wisdom, the wisdom of equality, discriminating wisdom, all-accomplish­ing wisdom, the pure dharmadhâtu, and all the buddha qualities such as the ten pow­ers). This fundamental change is obtained through the supramundane nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise seeing all phenomena as being empty and the pure mundane wisdom of subsequent attainment seeing all phenomena as illusions and mi­rages. IX. 13 speaks of the superiority of the fundamental change of buddhahood even over the fundamental changes of sràvakas and pratyekabuddhas since they do not have compassion for all beings and do not relinquish all cognitive obscurations. Therefore, buddhas feel compassion even for sràvakas and pratyekabuddhas. IX. 14 plays on the word “fundamental change” by adding ten different prefixes to the Sanskrit word vrtti in àsrayaparivrtti, most of which highlight the dynamic character of this fundamental change called “buddhahood.” Thus, it is a “pro-change” because it is always engaged in the welfare of all sentient beings. It is a “superchange” since it is the best of all phenom­ena, superior to any mundane phenomena and even to supramundane Sràvakas and pratyekabuddhas. It is a “nonchange” because it is the changeless result that consists of the three causes of afflictions (the presence of objects, improper mental engagement, and not having relinquished the latencies of both) not being active anymore. It is a “counterchange” since it does not engage in afflictions or nonvirtue, and counteracts selfish actions. It is an “ongoing change” since it functions all the time (once this funda­mental change has occurred, its operation will never decline until the end of samsàra) and engages in all the remedies for afflicted phenomena. It is a “dual change” because it first engages in demonstrating full awakening and finally engages in demonstrating nirvâna. It is a “nondual change” because, ultimately, it neither engages in samsàra nor in nirvâna. For by virtue of being endowed with prajnà and compassion, it has relin­quished what is conditioned and what is unconditioned, respectively. It is an “equal change” because as far as merely being liberated from all afflictions goes, it is equal in sràvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas. It is a “special change” because it is superior to the fundamental changes of sràvakas and pratyekabuddhas by virtue of having relin­quished the cognitive obscurations and possessing the qualities such as the ten powers. It is an “omnipresent change” because it engages all sentient beings through the three yànas in an omnipresent way. Also, since it is endowed with all these supreme quali­ties (the uncontaminated dharmas that are the remedies for all afflictions), it operates in a very vast manner. In particular, Sthiramati comments on IX. 15 say that just as space is omnipresent in all kinds of phenomena in the three times, the uncontaminated"},{"pageNumber":1115,"pageContent":"Notes 1099dharmadhàtu exists in and pervades the mind streams of all sentient beings. This is to be understood here in terms of buddhas’ experiencing and accepting all beings as not being different from themselves in a perfect manner—“experiencing” here means realizing the equality of themselves and all beings. Buddhahood has the nature of the dharmadhàtu, and once the characteristic of the omnipresence of the dharmadhàtu is realized on the first bhümi, a state of mind of perceiving oneself and all beings as equal is attained. Through progressively cultivating the realization of this equality through­out the remaining bhümis, at the time of buddhahood, this realization is completely perfected in an all-encompassing manner. This is what is called “being omnipresent in the hosts of beings.” IX. 16 answers the qualm why sentient beings do not realize the dharmadhàtu and do not see buddhas despite the dharmadhâtu’s always existing and being omnipresent in them. Just as the moon is not seen in vessels that are without water or broken, the mind streams of beings are either like an empty vessel (due to not being filled with the accumulations of merit and wisdom) or their mind streams are impaired (due to being full of afflictions and evil deeds). Despite such beings having the nature of a buddha, they do not see it. Naturally, the reverse applies for beings whose mind streams are endowed with merit and wisdom. Thus, IX. 17 says that just as fire burns in places with sufficient fuel but does not burn in places without, buddhas appear and teach when and wherever there are beings to be guided who have gathered sufficient degrees of the fuel that consists of the accumulations of merit and wisdom, but they pass into nirvana when and wherever such beings are not present.1459. As Schmithausen remarks, the aksaras between vikâra0 and atah are for the most part illegible. I follow his suggestion of a possible reading vikâran na bhajate (which would require Tib. bsten instead of DP ston).1460. As mentioned above, “having arrived at [pure] suchness” or “suchness’ having be­come pure” (lit. “having arrived at purity”) is one of the meanings of “tathagata” (as a shortened compound of tathatâ and àgata).1461. As for this partly corrupt sentence (sa ca sarvesâm api... prakrtinirvisistânàm sarvâ- gantukamalavišuddhim âgatas tathâgata . . .), I follow Schmithausens emendation (sâ [MB] ca sarvesâm api . . . prakftinirvisistâpi sarvâgantukamalavisuddhim âgatà tathâgata ...) based on DP (deyang... sems can thams cad la yang rang bzhin khyad par med du zin kyang/ ... rnam par dagpa la [text: las] gyurpa de bzhin gshegspa ...), whose structure moreover accords with a part of Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra IX.37 (sarvesâm avišistápi tathatâ suddhim âgatà tathâgatatvam ...) quoted in the text below.1462. As already implied here, at the beginning of the second chapter (awakening), it will be explained that the tathagata heart is an equivalent of suchness with stains, while buddhahood or tathâgatahood is equivalent to suchness without stains.1463. D100, fol. 297a.5-6. In D100, the first sentence reads: “The Tathagata knows that the grasping at propounding a self is the root.” Right before this, the sütra speaks of four types of grasping, with the grasping at propounding a self being the most fundamental one.1464. IX.37. Besides pointing to the changelessness of suchness, the three elements in this verse (suchness without difference, tathâgata, and heart)—can also be seen as parallel­ing the three elements in Uttaratantra 1.28 (suchness, dharmakaya, and disposition).1465.1 follow DP mdzes pa as the meaning of šubha here, which seems to fit best with the two reasons in lines 1.15led.1466.

D258, fol. 253b.5-6. The canonical versions of the sutra literally say, “Now, the tathagata disposition has entered sentient beings and exists within them, but these sentient beings do not realize this.” As Zimmermann (2002, 137) notes, a paracanon- ical translation of the sutra from Bathang (which is closer to the Sanskrit as quoted in RGVV here) and the Chinese translation by Amoghavajra read “element” (cihdtu) instead of “disposition” (gotra). As for “has entered,” in accordance with what the sutra says a few lines down, bzhugs (“abides”) needs to be emended to zhugs. According to Zimmermann, the expression that the tathagata element has “arisen” in or “entered” sentient beings is probably influenced by this passages being found in the context of the example of a cakravartin in the belly of a destitute woman, which says that life has entered (zhugs) the womb of that woman. The phrases, “exists ... in the form of their heart (or in the form of an embryo)” (RGVV) and “exists within them” (DP: khong na yod; Bathang: snying po la gnas pa) render the same compound garbhagata. As Zim­mermann (ibid., 58-60) points out, both meanings are possible from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, though the latter is the more reasonable one for an unbiased reader (as confirmed by the Tibetan versions of the sutra). This is also indicated by the corresponding verse 1.123 in the Uttaratantra, which speaks of the cakravartins abid­ing within the womb (garbhantarasthe) and the tathagata hearts abiding within sentient beings themselves (svdtmdntarasthesu) as their protector. However, RGVV’s point here is to identify tathdgatagarbha with dhatu, which is then said to be the cause for attaining buddhahood. Therefore, garbha can here mean only “heart” (or embryo), and it is in support of this meaning that RGVV quotes the passage from the Tathdgatagarbhasutra.1468. D45.48, fol. 275a.3-4. D45.48 reads: “Bhagavan, this tathagata heart is the heart of the supreme dharmadhatu. It is the heart of the dharmakaya. It is the heart of the su- pramundane dharmas. It is the heart of the naturally pure dharmas.”1469. Ibid., fol. 274b.2-4. D45.48 reads: “Therefore, Bhagavan, the tathagata heart is the abode, support, and foundation of the [qualities] that do not abide as being different [from it], are connected [to it], and are known to be liberated from their cocoon (sbubs nasgrol ba’i shespa can). Bhagavan, thus, the tathagata heart is also the abode, support, and foundation of the external conditioned phenomena that are not connected [to it], do not abide as being different [from it], and are not known to be liberated (shespa grol ba ma lags pa).”1470. Ibid., fol. 274a.6-7. D45.48 reads: “Bhagavan, if the tathagata heart exists, the word samsara’ is reasonable” (’khor ba zhes mchis na ni tshig de rigs pa lags so). DP has “Bhagavan, if the tathagata heart exists, it is labeled with the word samsara’” (de la ’khor ba zhes tshiggis btags pa lags so).1471.

As Ruegg (1969, 330-31) points out, the same statement is found in several other sutras with regard to impermanence (Ahguttara Nikaya 1.286), de­pendent origination (Samyutta Nikaya 11.25, 60, and 124; Digha Nikdya 1.190; and the Sdlistambasutra [Sanskrit reconstruction in N.

The text of D120 has several variant readings, but none is of significant difference.1485. This could also be read as “the principle of the tathâgata heart’s being the [actual] meaning of emptiness.” DP has “the tathâgata heart as the principle of emptiness” (stong pa nyid kyi tshul du de bzhin gshegs pai snying po).1486. “Whose minds are distracted from emptiness” translates the Sanskrit compound sünyatâviksiptacitta, which contains an intriguing ambiguity since it can be under­stood as a mind distracted by emptiness, toward emptiness, or from emptiness. The primary reading “distracted from emptiness” is supported by the occurrence of sünyatârthanayâd bahis cittam viksipyate in the text below and the consistent rendering stong pa nyid las sems rnam parg.yengs pa in DP (P once has stong pa nyid la). However, the comments here show that this compound also contains the meaning “distracted by or toward emptiness.” For the point is that beginner bodhisattvas are distracted by a wrong understanding of emptiness toward a wrong notion of emptiness (either mis­conceiving it as something that destroys phenomena or as some separate reified entity to be focused on deliberately) and thus are distracted from the correct understanding of emptiness, which is explicitly identified here as the principle of what emptiness means in the case of the tathâgata heart (explained in detail in the comments on 1.154-155 in the text below). This ambiguity is reflected in the quotations of the passages from RG W that contain this Sanskrit compound in other Tibetan texts and translations, which (in a rather inconsistent manner) take this compound to have either one of the"},{"pageNumber":1118,"pageContent":"1102 Notesabove meanings (respectively using la, las, or kyis after stong pa nyid\\ as mentioned already, the Laňkávatárasůtra has kyis). GC (438.26-439.20) comments on RGVVs paragraph on “those who are distracted from emptiness” as follows. In general, among the four kinds of bodhisattvas mentioned above (those who have generated bodhi- citta for the first time, those who have entered bodhisattva conduct, irreversible bodhi­sattvas, and those obstructed from buddhahood by only a single lifetime), it is impossible for the latter three to be distracted from emptiness. However, since such is possible for those who have generated bodhicitta for the first time, they are called “those who have newly entered the [mahá]yána.” Still, only some of them are distracted from emptiness because there are also those beginner bodhisattvas who first ascertain the ultimate and then generate bodhicitta through the power of the compassion that arises from that ascertainment. Therefore, the Niyatániyatagatimudrávatárasutra explains that there are “the bodhisattvas proceeding as if by ox-cart” who, after having generated bodhi­citta, rely on the árávakayána for their practice. The ones who have that disposition are the first kind of those who are distracted from emptiness. Through not directing their minds toward phenomenal identitylessness, when they attain nirvana, they apprehend the impermanence in terms of the previously existing reality of the origin of suffering having discontinued and perished to be nirvana. They also assert the state that is char­acterized by sufferings not arising henceforth to be nirvana and emptiness. The second kind of those who are distracted from emptiness are described by the Samdhinirmo- canasútras speaking of bodhisattvas on the level of engagement through aspiration who hold that the characteristics of formational phenomena and the characteristics of the ultimate are different or the same (as for the term “engagement through aspiration,” in its more general sense, as is the case here, it refers to both the paths of accumulation and preparation, while its more narrow sense refers to the path of preparation alone). Thus, to assert that what is called “emptiness”—the object that is to be directly realized and with which one should familiarize in a deliberate way —exists as an entity that is different from form and so on means to assert that the characteristics of formational phenomena and the ultimate are different. Since those who hold the characteristics of formational phenomena and the ultimate to be the same apprehend what is not emptiness as emptiness, they too are implicitly included in those who are distracted from emptiness. As for the phrase, “through focusing on emptiness” in RGVV, it is through focusing on emptiness as a (real) entity that the second kind of those who are distracted from emptiness assert emptiness as the door of emptiness and resort to that emptiness. By contrast, Chaba Chókyi Sengés commentary on the Uttaratantra (Phyva pa chos kyi seng ge 2006, fol. 63b.5-8) says, “The principle of emptiness—the tathagata heart—refers to being merely empty of an object to be negated that is something to be eliminated (mam par bead pa). Those who deviate from this regard it as something that is positively delimited (yongs gcod).” Thus, he continues to identify bodhisattvas of the first type who have newly entered the mahayana as being the Mere Mentalists. He elab­orates that “‘the destruction of [previously] really existing phenomena at a later time refers to emptiness [in the sense of] the ultimately existent impure dependent [natures] having been destroyed later through having been eliminated and thus having become nonexistent. As for this being asserted as nirvana, it is claimed to be the stainless purity [that is the perfect nature]. To assert this as the door to liberation [that is emptiness] means that it is claimed to be the ultimate.” Then, Chaba identifies bodhisattvas of the second type who have newly entered the mahayana as those who assert emptiness as the emptiness of one things not existing in another one. Regarding this as “what is to be realized and with which one should familiarize” refers to the time of the result and"},{"pageNumber":1119,"pageContent":"Notes 1103the path, respectively. “Form” consists of the duality of apprehender and apprehended. “An entity that is distinct from form” refers to the self-aware mind that is empty of that duality, which is an implicative negation—the emptiness that is the ultimate dependent nature. “Those who resort to emptiness” are those who claim this limited emptiness.1487. DP read “What is the tathâgata that is expressed as the principle of emptiness here?” (de la stong pa nyid kyi tshul du brjod pa de bzhin gshegs pa’i snying po gang zhe na).1488. This verse represents one of the most famous and often-cited stanzas in the literature of the mahàyàna, being essential in both the Uttaratantra and the Abhisamayâlamkâra (V.21). As for its origin, Gampopas Ornament of Liberation (Lha rje bsod nams rin chen 1990, 289) says that it is found in the Gaganaganjapariprcchâsütra (D148), but I could not locate it there. Instead, except for the third line, this verse is found in the érîmahâbalatantra (P36, fol. 34a.6-7). To provide a bit more of the context of these three lines in that tantra, the lines immediately preceding and following them are as follows:Once identitylessness in phenomena is realized,Mind will be realized.Everything is filled with the flavor of being empty—This is called “mahàsukhakàya.”It is prajnàpàramità—In this, there is nothing to be removed And not the slightest to add on.Who sees true reality is liberated.Be it a single disposition, three dispositions,Five dispositions, a hundred dispositions, and so on,In this true reality, there is no difference.Once you have found an ox,You don’t search for the traces of that ox.Likewise, if you have found the true reality of mind,You don’t search for any thoughts at all.Note that the last four lines also represent a very common example in the Mahâmudrâ tradition.

The Chinese translation of this passage (Taisho 353, 221c) uses the terms “the empty tathagata heart” and “the nonempty tathagata heart.”1492. As already mentioned, these two sentences (with minor variations) originally come from the Culasuhhatasutta (Majjhima Nikaya 121). They are also found in the Abhidharmasamuccaya (D4049, fol. 76b.3), Vasubandhus Madhydntavibhagabhasya on 1.1, Sthiramatis Madhyantavibhagatika on 1.1, the Satasdhasrikdpahcavimsatisa- hasrikastddasasdhasrikdprajndpdramitdbrhattikd (D3808, fol. 63a.2-3), Jagaddala- nivasin’s Bhagavatydmndydnusdrinmamavydkhya (D3811, fol. 293a.5), and the Bodhi­sattvabhumi (Dutt ed., 32.12-13; D4037, fol. 26b.5-6). The larger context in which this passage appears in the Bodhisattvabhumi (Dutt ed., 32.6-23; D4037, fols. 26b.4-27a.3) is the justification of the correct understanding of emptiness: “Some sramanas or Brahmans neither assert that of which something is empty nor do they assert what is empty of what. Such is called a bad grasp of emptiness.’ For what reason? Emptiness is reasonable by virtue of that which is empty’s being really existent and by virtue of that of which it is empty not being really existent. By virtue of everything’s being non­existent, where would what be empty of what? Therefore, the emptiness [in the sense] of such [nonexistence] is not reasonable [though the Tibetan supports this reading, the sentence could also be understood as ‘the emptiness of somethings being empty of something is not reasonable’]. Hence, such represents a bad grasp of emptiness. So how is emptiness grasped well? Since one sees that something’s not existing somewhere [means that] the latter is empty of the former, one understands, in accordance with true reality, that what remains there really exists there. This is called ‘engaging emptiness unmistakenly as it accords with true reality.’... Therefore, the entities about which one has notions such as form are empty of the character of the designational terms ‘form’ and so on. What is the remainder here in these entities about which one has notions such as form? It is said to be the bases of the designational terms ‘form’ and so on. As for these two, it is said that one understands, in accordance with true reality, the exis­tence of mere entities and the mere designations as mere entities. One does not super­impose what is not truly real, nor does one deny what is truly real. One does not create any redundancy, nor does one create any deficiency. One does not set up [anything], nor does one reject [anything]. One realizes, in accordance with true reality, what is in accordance with true reality—suchness, whose nature is inexpressible. This is said to be a good grasp of emptiness— its being well realized through perfect prajna. This [de­scription] is the one that accords with reasoning that establishes tenability and the one through which the inexpressible nature of all phenomena is to be known in an exact manner.” The Bodhisattvabhumi (Dutt ed., 30.27-31.4; D4037, fol. 25b.3-5) also says that those who cling through superimposing existence onto what is not truly real (the specific characteristics of the designations for entities such as forms) and those who absolutely deny the true reality of what is ultimately truly real as having an inexpress­ible nature (the mere entities that are the bases of designations) have fallen away from"},{"pageNumber":1121,"pageContent":"Notes 1105the dharma. In addition (Dutt ed., 31.17-19; D4037, fol. 26a.5-6), those who deny both designations and true reality are the chief nihilists, with whom those with pure conduct should not associate and who bring only misery upon themselves and others. The text (Dutt ed., 146.9-14; D4037, fol. 113b.2-4) also lists the distinctive features of the pra­jna of bodhisattvas with regard to truly realizing phenomenal identitylessness, which include being utterly peaceful, nonconceptual, free from reference points, and without the two extremes of superimposition and denial (as indicated above). Due to these features, this prajna should be understood as the one that follows the middle path and realizes true reality. For the original context and the vast range of interpretations of the quote from the Culasunhatasutta in the above and other texts, see Dargyay 1990 and Nagao 1991, 51-60. The Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisamayalamkara (Brunnholzl 2010,510) explains it as follows: “With nondual wisdom (ultimate reality) not existing during any phase of nondual consciousness (seeming reality), one sees or realizes clearly or in a supreme way (that is, in the manner of according with the actual way of being through the prajna of identitylessness that is a natural outflow of the dharmadhatu) that this wisdom is empty of nondual consciousness (seeming reality). In this nondual wisdom, there always exists the remainder that remains primordially and is primordially empty of the adventitious stains of nondual consciousness—the nondual wisdom that is not enshrouded in these adventitious stains.”1493.1 follow MA/MB viparitam and DP phyin ci ma log pa against J aparyantam.1494. As the citation of the passage from the Culasunhatasutta in Sthiramati’s Madhyan- tavibhdgatika shows, what is said here is reminiscent of the explanation in Madhyan- tavibhdga 1.1 about duality’s not existing in false imagination, while emptiness exists in false imagination. Also, Madhyantavibhaga 1.13 declares the two defining charac­teristics of emptiness as the nonbeing (or nonexistence) of duality and the being (or existence) of said nonbeing (or nonexistence). That is, emptiness is neither existent as duality nor is it nonexistent altogether because it exists as the very being of the lack of duality. The same meaning is found in 1.20 saying that the nonexistence of persons and phenomena is emptiness, while the real existence of the nonexistence of persons and phenomena in it is another emptiness. The Bhdsya on this comments that emptiness is defined as twofold in this way as the emptiness of what does not exist (persons and phenomena) and the emptiness that is the nature of what does not exist in order to avoid the two extremes of wrongly superimposing actually nonexistent persons and phenomena and wrongly denying the existence of the emptiness of these persons and phenomena. Note that this represents the typical Yogacara approach to the middle way of avoiding extremes that usually hinges primarily on avoiding the two extremes of wrongly superimposing what does not exist and denying what actually does exist. By contrast, the Madhyamaka approach to the middle way beyond extremes aims at avoid­ing any notions of existence or nonexistence altogether.1495.

This passage follows the passage already mentioned from the Srïmâlâdevïsütra (D45.48, fol. 275a.2-3) that says that the tathâgata heart is the heart of the dharma- dhàtu, the heart of the dharmakàya, the heart of the supramundane dharmas, and the heart of the naturally pure dharmas.1502.

Schmithausen parallels “here and there” (tatra tatra) with “in each sentient being” (sattve sattve) in the last line. Thus, one would have to translate “Having said that, [in sentient beings] here and there, . . .” However, the more likely meaning is “here and there in the mahàyàna sûtras,” which is confirmed by VT (fol. 14rl) that glosses “here and there” as “in the sûtras.” This also corresponds to C’s rendering sütra[koti]su (“sütra” in transcription!) instead of bhütakotisu in 1.158b.1505. With Takasaki, the Sanskrit of this line could also be read as “everything is to be understood as being empty in all respects,” but I read it following DP shes bya thams cad rnam kun stong pa zhes.1506.1 follow Schmithausen in taking bhütakotisu to mean “in myriads of beings” (though bhüta for “sentient beings” is not so common in mahàyàna texts) rather than DP s ren­dering yang dag mtha} ni, which ignores the plural and locative ending of the San­skrit (thus reading “the true end is devoid of conditioned phenomena in all aspects”). Interestingly, the translations by Takasaki, de Jong, and Ui (as referenced in de Jong 1968, 48) all agree with DPs reading of bhütakoti in the singular. Since 1.158 is an explanation of I.156ab, with “void” corresponding to “empty,” “conditioned phenom­ena” to “all (knowable objects),” and “in all aspects” to “in every respect,” bhütakotisu most likely corresponds to “here and there.” However, this is where the problem lies, since Schmithausen takes “here and there” to be related to “in each sentient being” in I.156d. Though not impossible, this is not only somewhat strange in this context but, more importantly, contradicted by VTs above gloss and virtually all Tibetan commentaries, which take “here and there” to mean “in the (prajnàpàramità) sûtras.” If one still accepts that bhütakotisu takes up “here and there” (which is likely, given the other correspondences between I.156ab and 1.158), C’s rendering “in [myriads of] sûtras” (sütra[koti]su, with “sütra” in transcription!) instead of bhütakotisu seems to make much more sense. Also, if bhütakotisu referred back to “in each sentient being,” it would pick up a phrase in I.156d, whereas all other correspondences with 1.158 are only to I.156ab. Thus, I would prefer to read I.158ab as “It has been stated in myriads of sûtras that conditioned phenomena are void in all aspects.” However, since the San­skrit and DP as well as all Tibetan commentaries agree on bhüta°, while C is the only exception, I reluctantly follow the former in reading bhüta°.1507.

The general Buddhist abhidharma lists five types of results: (1) matured results, (2) dominated results, (3) results that accord with their cause, (4) results caused by persons, and (5) results of freedom (or separation). The latter is defined as “the exhaustion or relinquishment of the specific factors to be relinquished through the force of the rem­edy that is prajna.” Thus, in the general abhidharma, a result of freedom is defined as an absence of factors to be relinquished and thus is an unconditioned nonentity (while the other four results are conditioned entities). A nonentity is defined as “what is not able to perform a function,” but here as well as elsewhere in the Uttaratantra and RGVV, it is made clear many times that buddhahood, despite being unconditioned and a result of freedom, is able to perform the functions of accomplishing the welfare of all sentient beings and so on. The entire fourth chapter is ample testimony to that, representing the detailed answer to the question in RGVV s introduction to IV.13ff (J99), “It has been de­clared that buddhahood is characterized by being without arising and without ceasing. How is it then that from this unconditioned buddhahood, which has the characteristic of lacking functionality, effortless, uninterrupted, and nonconceptual buddha activity manifests functionality for as long as the world lasts?” In addition, Uttaratantra 11.18- 20 describes enlightened activity in terms of eternal space-like buddhahoods being the cause for others experiencing pure objects of their six sense faculties. 11.38-41 on the topic “manifestation” speaks about the undifferentiable space-like dharmadhatu’s mak­ing efforts in accomplishing the liberation of beings through all kinds of appearances, thus being the cause for introducing beings to the path and maturing them. When introducing this topic, RGVV (J85) says, “Now, this tathagatahood manifests as being inseparable from its unconditioned qualities, just like space. Nevertheless, since it is en­dowed with unique attributes, one should see that it, through its particular applications of inconceivable great means, compassion, and prajna and by way of the three stainless"},{"pageNumber":1124,"pageContent":"n o 8 Noteskâyas (svâbhàvika[kâya], sâmbhogika[kâya], and nairmânika[kâya]), manifests as the cause that brings about the benefit and happiness of beings in an uninterrupted, end­less, and effortless manner for as long as [samsäric] existence lasts.” RGW on 1.7 (J8) explicitly affirms that unconditioned buddhahood entails enlightened activity: “Even though it is unconditioned and has the characteristic of being inactive, from tathägata- hood all activities of the perfect Buddha unfold without effort in an unimpeded and un­interrupted manner until the end of samsâra.” In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Tathâgatagarbhasütra repeatedly emphasizes that the full revelation or manifestation of the tathägata heart as buddhahood automatically entails the performance of buddha activity as its main characteristic, thus “describing a tathägata primarily in terms of dynamic activity” (Zimmermann 2002, 65). Furthermore, SM 8c says that “suchness operates in accordance (anuvrtti) with the welfare [of beings].” Yamabe (1997, n. 32) also refers to “the Hsien-yangsheng-chiao lun (Taishö 31,581c5-8), which states that all the actions of the buddhas arise on the basis of the *asamskrta-dharmakaya.”1524. VT (fol. 14r4) glosses “just as space” as representing the function of one’s own welfare and the remainder of lines II. 18cd as representing the function of the welfare of others, with “the wise” being bodhisattvas on the ten bhümis and wise persons (satpurusa).1525. VT (fol. 14r4-5) glosses “powerful form” (vibhütirüpam) as “the excellence or accom­plishment of his own form” (svarüpasampattï) and “objects” (artha) as “buddha realms and so on.” DP dbang ’byor gzugs don corresponds to the Sanskrit vibhütirüpârtha but Ut (D) has ’byung med gzugs don (“nonelemental forms and objects”), which is also found in the versions in most Tibetan commentaries (such as GC, HLS, and JKC) and commented on accordingly. Rongtön’s commentary (Rong ston shes bya kun gzigs 1997, 160) says that vibhüti can mean either “powerful” or “nonelemental,” but that it here means the former.1526. VT (fol. 14r5) glosses this as “the stainless speech of the victor.”1527. According to VT (fol. 14r5), discipline is described as fragrance because it is the cause of a buddha s fragrance.1528.

For the last two lines, C has “It is the matrix because it has the nature of stainless wis­dom and pure attributes” (corresponding to amalajhana£ukla°), which is the preferred reading of Schmithausen. However, my translation follows MB padain tad amalajnä- nam (MA amalam jnänam) sukla°, which is confirmed by DP dri med shes de dkarpoyi / chos kyi rten yin phyir na gnas /. In the Yogäcära system in general, as exemplified by Mahâyânasamgraha 1.48, the usual distinction between the vimuktikâya and the dhar­makâya is that the former designates the removal of only the afflictive obscurations as attained by ¿rävaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, while the latter represents the removal of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations as well as the possession of all buddha qualities. Thus, when speaking about the dharmakâya as the actual state of buddha­hood in a general sense, it is understood that both types of obscurations have been relinquished in it, and it is in this sense that it can be said that the dharmakâya includes the vimuktikâya. Here, the Uttaratantra describes these two kâyas as the two aspects of relinquishment (purity) and realization (wisdom), respectively, of unconditioned"},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"Notes 1109perfect buddhahood, without relating them to any distinction between buddhas and arhats (more commonly, it is the svàbhàvikakâya that is said to represent the aspect of the purity or the relinquishment of all obscurations). Note, however, that VT (fol. 14r5-6) glosses the vimuktikàya as “the sambhogakàya and the nirmànakàya free from the latent tendencies of the afflictions and so on” and its “perfection” (11.21 c) as “the production of the accumulation of generosity and so on.” Likewise, the vimuktikàya’s being “understood in two ways” (II.22b) is glossed as “as the difference between sam­bhogakâya and nirmànakàya.” As for 11.21-26, most Tibetan commentaries agree that the nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise (familiarizing with the wisdom of knowing suchness) perfects the vimuktikàya (the ultimate relinquishment), while the wisdom of subsequent attainment (training in the wisdom of knowing variety) puri­fies the stains of the dharmakáya (the ultimate realization). As for “the vimuktikàya and the dharmakáya being understood in two ways and in one way,” RYC (148-49) relates the two ways to the vimuktikàya (its being liberated from both afflictive and cognitive obscurations), while the one way pertains to the dharmakáya and consists of consummate wisdom. GC (479-80) agrees with describing the vimuktikàya in two ways and the dharmakáya in one way, saying that the former is uncontaminated (because of being free from the afflictive obscurations and their latent tendencies) and all-perva­sive (because of lacking the obscurations of attachment and obstruction with regard to all knowable objects). The dharmakáya is unconditioned because it has the nature of being absolutely indestructible. YDC (344-45) explains that the vimuktikàya refers to buddhahood in terms of its aspect of relinquishment, while the dharmakáya refers to it in terms of the aspect of its qualities. Therefore, though ¿ràvakas and pratyekabuddhas make efforts in familiarizing with the lack of a self, they do not train in the entire variety of knowable objects and therefore only attain the vimuktikàya but not the dharmakáya. As for “being understood in two ways,” the vimuktikàya is to be understood in one of these two ways—being uncontaminated because afflictive and cognitive obscurations including their latent tendencies have ceased. The dharmakáya is to be understood in the other one of these two ways—being the wisdom that pervades all knowable objects because it engages them through lacking the obscurations of attachment that obscure suchness and the obscurations of obstruction that obscure variety. Both the vimuk­tikàya and the dharmakáya are to be understood furthermore in the one way that is common to them both—being unconditioned because they have the nature of being absolutely indestructible. Therefore, YDC says, through the Uttaratantras verses on the nature and the function of awakening, it is clearly taught that buddhas have the wisdom of self-appearance and that this existent wisdom is unconditioned, which is to be understood well by the intelligent. JKC (137-40) agrees with YDC on the vi­muktikàya’s being uncontaminated because it is endowed with the relinquishment of lacking any contaminations. The dharmakáya is all-pervasive because it is endowed with the realization of pervading all knowable objects (Rong ston shes bya kun gzigs 1997, 161 and ’Ju mi pham rgya mtsho 1984b, 448.4 also show the same pattern). Both kàyas are unconditioned because they have the nature of not being produced by causes and conditions. Rongtôn, GC, YDC, and JKC agree that these three characteristics of the vimuktikàya and the dharmakáya represent ones own welfare, while both kàyas are also the foundation of all pure attributes, which represents the welfare of others (RYC speaks only of the dharmakáya as being that foundation). Still, lines II.30ab “one’s own welfare and that of others is taught through the vimuktikàya and the dharmakáya” are taken by all commentaries to mean that the vimuktikàya represents ones own wel­fare and the dharmakáya the welfare of others (which is basically just another way of"},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"m o Noteslooking at this).

Against MB and DP, Schmithausen gives preference to C and suggests vicitrabhdso for vicitrabhdvo because 11.51 c has atatsvabhdvdkhyane. However, bhdva can also mean “appearance” and the contrast bhdva! nihsvabhava is rather common in mahayana texts.1548. VT (fol. 14vl) says that 11.40 describes the sambhogakaya and 11.41 the nirmánakáya.1549. VT (fol. 14vl) glosses nirvrtih!nirvana (lit. “extinction”) as “the extinction of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations.”1550.1 follow MB paramdeintyaprdptih pratyatmam arhatdm (confirmed by VT, fol. 14vl- 2) against J paramdeintyapraptih pratydtmaveditd (DP mchog tu mya ngan ’das bsam med/dgra bcom so so’i bdaggyurpa Í). Schmithausen s suggested readingparamdeintyd praptih (orpraptd) due to DPs connecting acintya with nirvrtih not only contradicts both MB and VT but it is also inconclusive as far as DP goes. For it is not definite that “inconceivable” in DP has to go with “nirvana,” which is clearly shown by JKC and GC taking “inconceivable” as a characteristic of its own (as does C). VT relates both “highest” and “inconceivable” to attainment, speaking of “the arhats attainment of the highest inconceivable dharma,” which is then glossed as “buddhahood.”1551. Schmithausen suggests dharmadhdtusvabhavatah instead of MB dharmadhdtoh svabhdvatah. DP “it is luminous because it is pure by virtue of having the nature of the dharmadhatu” (chos dbyings ngo bo nyid kyis / dag pa’i phyir ni ’od gsal ba f).

VT (fol. 14v2-3) divides the compound vicitradharmasambhogarupadharmavabha- satah into vicitrasambhogadharmavabhasah (glossing it as “teaching the dharma”) and rupadharmavabhasah (glossing it as “the display of form”). However, DP read rang bzhin for °rupa°, and the Tibetan commentaries usually take this compound to mean “By way of enjoying all kinds of dharma and by way of appearing through its natural attributes.” Both interpretations come down to the same meaning, referring to the first two characteristics of the sambhogakaya—dharma instructions and the display of a sambhogakaya form with its major and minor marks (as briefly repeated in II.51a). The remaining three characteristics of the sambhogakaya are listed in II.49cd-50c, and all five are briefly repeated in 11.51.1553. VT (fol. 14v3) glosses “nothaving their nature” (atatsvabhdva°) as“thedharmadhatus lack of nature” (dharmadhatvasvabhavata).1554. With DP mag.yos par, aviralam is to be read as avicalan.1555.

Skt. sartha can also mean “(travel) company” (see Takasaki) or “assembly,” but DP don mthun pa confirms the more likely meaning here.1559. VT (fol. 14v3-4) glosses “for them” (esu) as “for sentient beings.”1560. As mentioned before, the first six topics that explain the fourth and the fifth vajra points have the same names (nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment, and mani­festation). In terms of their contents, the fourth vajra point refers to the tathagata heart with stains (the cause) and the fifth one to the very same tathagata heart without stains (the fruition). Therefore, the six topics in each of these two vajra points are naturally related in terms of cause and fruition or in terms of what buddha nature is like while it is still obscured by adventitious stains versus what it is like when it is completely un­obscured. For a detailed comparison of the contents of the first six topics of the fourth and fifth vajra points, see appendix 7.1561. As will be seen in the text below, in verses 11.63-68, two lines each correspond to the ten reasons in 11.62 for buddhahoods being permanent, with “protector of the world” in II.62d (VT fol. 14v6: lokanathatvdt) being considered the tenth reason.1562.1 follow MB °padapranetus ca against J padaprakasac ca.1563.

Takasaki remarks that vyanumeya (DP dpag bya min) here and in the next line should read vyupameya since the latter fits better with its referent upamanivrttitah in 11.69. VT (fol. 14v7) confirms the reading (vi)anumeya while glossing it as (vy)upama."},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"1112 Notes1568. This refers to bodhisattvas on the tenth bhümi who receive an empowerment through light rays from all buddhas.1569. As also explicitly stated in RGW in its introductory remarks on II.18ff, usually, the ultimate kâya and the fulfillment of ones own welfare are equated with the dhar­makaya, while the welfare of others and the conventional kàyas of seeming reality are equated with the two rüpakàyas. However, VT (fol. 15rl) glosses “ones own welfare” as “the sambhogakàya, which is the ultimate kâya.” “The welfare of others” is “the nirmànakàya, which is the seeming kâya based on the sambhoga[kàya].” VT further comments: “The fruition that is the freedom from the afflictions consists of the powers and so on. The maturational fruition consists of the [thirty-two] marks of a great being, which is the fruition that is in common [with others, such as cakravartins].”1570. VT (fol. 15vl-2) again glosses “the first body” as the sambhogakàya and “the second one” as the nirmànakàya.1571.1 follow MB tathâ tàn adhikrtya against J tathatàm adhikrtya. After this sentence, DP and C add “[First, there is] a synopsis” (uddànam).1572. According to VT (fol. 15r7), “the two kinds of display” refers to the Buddha’s appear­ance through his unique or uncommon qualities and through his common qualities (the thirty-two marks of a great being), which are explained in detail in verses III. 11-26 (see in particular III. 15 and 111.26).1573. VT (fol. 15v2-3) glosses “what is the case” as “[karmic] causes”; “maturation of kar­mas,” as “the maturation of these karmic [causes]”; “faculties,” as the five mental fac­ulties “such as confidence”; “constitutions,” as “having the nature of desire and so on”; “inclinations,” as “the inclinations of those who have such natures”; “the path that leads everywhere,” as “going to hell due to hateful behavior and to heaven, due to virtuous behavior”; “[afflicted] dhyànas,” as “obscurations of dhyàna”; and “peace,” as “the ter­mination of contamination.” For the individual causes of the ten powers according to the Ratnadàrikâsütra, see the note on III.5-6 in CMW.1574. VT (fol. 15v3) glosses “the collection of faculties” as “[the above faculties] being pure and so on, through which the obscurations of dhyàna are relinquished.”1575. VT (fol. 15v3-4) comments that line III.8b means to realize the reality of suffering, while line III.8c represents the reality of the origin of suffering, with “obstacles” refer­ring to desire and so on.1576. MB is rather illegible here, and Schmithausen suggests that, parallel to pràpteh para- prâpanâd in III.9c, J jnànàt svayat]ijnàpanàd (svayam has no correspondence in DP) could well be jnânât parajnàpanàd (there is no correspondence for para° in DP in either line), which is doubtlessly what is meant here.1577. Given the parallels in the first and third lines, I follow Schmithausen s emendation hànihàpanakrteh of J hânihàranakrteh (MA/MB hànikaranakrteh, which is metrically impossible).

DP legs gnas (corresponding to susthita).1581. DP “firm power” (brtan pdi rtsal), but according to 111.34, “firm” and “powerful” are two separate qualities.

For the individual causes of the eighteen unique qualities according to the Rat- nadârikàsütra, see the note on III.l 1—15 in CMW.1589.1 follow Schmithausen s emendation cdnv api of J cdsv api.1590. Given that 111.36 is the commentarial verse on III.16cd, I follow VT (fol. 15v5-6) saying that earth, water, fire, and wind in III.36c exemplify the common qualities of worldly people, sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, respectively, which are to be enjoyed by all. On the other hand, the unique buddha qualities are completely beyond even the supramundane qualities of Sravakas and so on and therefore resemble space. However, Schmithausen understands III.16cd as referring to just the unique bud­dha qualities being on the one hand common to the world (similar to earth, water, fire, and wind) and on the other hand uncommon to the world (similar to space). Though Schmithausen supports his reading by referring to the commentarial verse III.36, VT’s explanation contradicts Schmithausen s reading of both III.16cd and III.36. Also, the Tibetan commentaries usually explain III. 16cd to mean that all five elements including space are common to the world, whereas the unique buddha qualities are not. Thus, ultimately, these qualities cannot even be illustrated by the example of space. In fact, as III.36cd explicitly states, they are even beyond what is supramundane (the qualities of sravakas and so on). Besides being listed in the Dhdranisvarardjasutra (D147, fois. 175b.l-185a.6), as indicated below by Uttaratantra 111.27, the ten powers, four fearless­nesses, and eighteen unique qualities are also found in the Ratnaddrikasutra. This sütra is available only in two Chinese translations—as chapter 3 of the Mahdsamnipdtasutra (Taishô 397) and on its own as Taishô 399 (vol. XIII, 452-72). In Taishô 397, the ten powers and so on are found on pp. 34a if. They are also contained in the Anuttara- srayasütra (Taishô 669, 475b) and other sütras.1591. VT (fol. 15vl) adds that the hands are likewise marked with wheels.1592. Skt. anguli means both fingers and toes, and the following phrase “hands and feet” indicates both.1593. According to VT (fol. 15vl), “shoulders” refers to both arms and legs, thus obviously to shoulders and hips.1594. Skt. anunndma, DP mtho dman med pa.1595. According to VT (fol. 15v2), the throat has lines like a conch.1596. According to VT (fol. 15v2), there are twenty teeth each in the upper and lower jaws.1597. According to VT (fol. 15v2), none are longer or shorter (lit. “high and low”).1598. Ordinarily, kalavinka is a name of the red-green Indian sparrow and the Indian cuckoo alike.

It is often said to live in Amitabhas pure land Sukhàvatï.1599. In Hindu cosmology, this is the son of Mahàpurusa, the latter being the prime­val man as the soul and original source of the universe. Also, Nârâyana is variously identified as Brahma, Visnu, or Krsna.1600. Obviously, the numerical breakdown of the marks into thirty-two in these verses is far from being clear, so different commentaries give different numberings and combine certain features into one (for the list of thirty-two and their causes in GC and RYC, which is based on the Ratnadàrikâsütra, see the note on III. 17-25 in CMW). Note also that this list here is just one from among a considerable number of more or less dif­fering lists of the thirty-two marks that are found in various sûtras and treatises (for comprehensive lists, see Xing 2002, 27 and Tan 2011, 146-62). Also, the comments on them and their causes vary in different texts. Despite claims to the contrary, there is no evidence that the major marks (or the minor marks) are of Brahmanic origin or even of early Buddhist origin (all Buddhist sources are quite late; see Tan 2011). As indicated below in the Uttaratantra, its list of the thirty-two major marks (which includes some marks that the Abhisamayâlamkâra presents as minor marks) is based on the Ratnadàrikâpariprcchàsütra (Taishô 397, 37b-c) and is also contained in the Anuttarâirayasütra (Taishô 669, 474a-b). Except for minor differences in counting, this list is also found in TOK (see Brunnhôlzl 2011b, 457-58). For the different list of these marks and their causes in Abhisamayâlamkâra VIII. 13-17, which is based on the prajnàpàramità sûtras, see Brunnhôlzl 2011b, 117-21 (for the eighty minor marks, see 121-25) and Brunnhôlzl 2012a, 378-84 and 531-33 (for the minor marks, see 384-88 and 533-37). Except for a few minor changes in the order and some additional features, the Abhisamayâlamkàras list is basically repeated in Nàgàrjunas Ratnàvalï 11.77-96, and 11.98 adds that cakravartins also possess these marks but that their purity, beauty, and clarity matches not even a fraction of those of buddhas. Except for differences in the numbering, chapter 8 of the *Prajnâpàramitâsâstra (Taisho 1509, 90a-91a) as­cribed to Nàgàrjuna also follows the list in the Abhisamayâlamkâra. For a comparison of the list in the Uttaratantra with the lists in Haribhadras Abhisamayàlamkàrâlokà and the Mahàvyutpatti, see the notes in Takasaki 1966a on the translation of Uttaratan­tra III. 17-25. For the most detailed presentations of the major marks apart from the prajnàpàramità sûtras, see the Lakkhanasutta (Dïgha Nikàya III. 142-79; translated in Walshe 1995, 441-60 and Tan 2011, 180-213; the latter also provides an overview of mainly Pâli sources of both the major and minor marks and discusses the potential Babylonian origin of the former) and the Arthaviniscayasütra (Samtani 2002, 205-16), which however lists thirty-three marks. See also the Lalitavistarasütra ([Berkeley: Dharma Publishing, 1983], 1:155-56), the Mahàvyutpatti (section 17, nos. 236-67; translated in Thurman 1976, 156), and Pawo Tsugla Trengwas commentary on the Bodhicaryàvatàra (Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phreng ba n.d., 720-23).1601. In III.26b, MB reads “ponds” in plural (hradesu ca\\ though ca is hypermetrical), which corresponds to “surfaces” (talesu) in III.26d (MB is illegible here, but VT confirms °tala). DP have no plural for “pond,” nor any equivalents of “great” and said ca. For “splen­dor” (vibhüta, which can also mean “power,” “glory,” “abundance,” and “greatness”), DP have “form” (gzugs). “Circles” (mandala) is here to be understood as the retinues of the Buddha, which is confirmed by VTs (fol. 15v3) gloss of sambuddhamandalatala as “the nature of the retinue of the perfect Buddha” (sambuddhaparsatsvarüpam).1602.

For RYC’s quotes from the Ratnadarikasutra that list the individual causes of these sixty-four qualities, see the notes on the corresponding verses in CMW.1605. I follow Schmithausens suggestion of linking baladisu at the beginning of 111.29 with 111.28.1606. Skt. nirvedhikatva. Though DP mistakenly has “impenetrable” (mi phyed pa), as con­firmed by VT (fol. 15v3) nairvedhikatvena and C, the point here is that a vajra pene­trates other materials, not that it is itself impenetrable.1607. Since this verse obviously refers back to and comments on III.16ab, with Schmithau­sen, I follow C pancadhatu versus J pahcadha tu. Thus, the qualities of worldly peo­ple, sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas (“the intelligent”) are compared with earth, water, fire, and wind, respectively, while the buddhas (“the self-arisen”) with their unique qualities are like space.1608. As mentioned above, 111.36 is the commentarial verse on III.16cd. VT (fol. 15v5- 6) explains here that earth, water, fire, and wind in III.36c exemplify the qualities of worldly people, sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, respectively, which are to be enjoyed by all. On the other hand, the unique buddha qualities are completely be­yond even the supramundane—the qualities of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhi­sattvas—and therefore resemble space. Note that Schmithausen refers to the following two passages in RG W to support his reading that the subject of the entire verse III.36 is nothing but the unique buddha qualities: (a) A verse in RGW (J17.10f) says:Those who gave rise to supreme compassion for others And adopted discipline support the livelihood of others,Just like fire, wind, water, and earth.They [truly] possess discipline, [but] others are [only] a likeness of that.(b) RG W ’s quote from the Avatamsakasutra (J23.14 ad 24.8) says, “tathagata wisdom, the immeasurable wisdom that is the wisdom that sustains all sentient beings, pervades the mind streams of all sentient beings in its entirety ... this immeasurable tathagata wisdom becomes what sustains the entire world.” However, it is clear from the context that (a) refers to bodhisattvas and not buddhas. Also, (b) does not refer specifically to the unique buddha qualities as they are discussed in III. 16 and 111.36 but to buddha wisdom in a very general way.1609.1 follow Schmithausens emendation °laksanakhyd ye or laksandhvaye (supported by DP gang/sum cu rtsa gnyis zhes bya ba) of J laksanah kaye.1610. MB dvidha tu darsanam, J dvidha taddarsanam (following DP de mthong ba ni rnam pa gnyis). However, DP mthong ba for darsanam means “seeing” instead of “display,” as the term was used so far in relation to the rupakayas. Thus, in DP, III.39ab reads, “For those who dwell far from and close to purity, the seeing of these [kayas occurs] in two ways.”1611.1 follow Schmithausens emendation £uddhavari° of J suddham vari°, which accords with C and °svacchadakacandra° in III.28d. Also, DP chu dang means “clear/pure wa­ter” and not “water and . . .” The most straightforward reading of this verse is that the nirmanakaya appears to those distant from purity (ordinary beings, ¿ravakas, and pratyekabuddhas), which is just like the reflection of the moon in water, while the sam­bhogakaya appears to those close to purity (bodhisattvas on the bhumis), which is just like the actual moon in the sky. However, VT (fol. 15v7) seems to relate III.39d only to “in the mandala of the victor,” saying that “the manifestation in the mandala of the"},{"pageNumber":1132,"pageContent":"iii6 Notesvictor for those who are far from purity [occurs] in the form of the nirmana[kaya], which is like [the reflection of] the moon in water, while the manifestation for those who are close to purity is the sambhoga[kaya], which is like the moon in the sky.” On this reading, the nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya appear only to those in the retinue of a buddha. By contrast, the ways in which a buddha appears “in the world” (that is, outside of his retinue) could implicitly be understood as the appearances of the other two types of nirmanakayas beyond the actual form of a nirmanakaya buddha such as Buddha Sakyamuni—artistic nirmanakaya forms (such as great artists, healers, and musicians) and incarnate nirmanakaya forms (appearing as anything that is beneficial for beings, be it animate or inanimate, such as ordinary beings, animals, or medicine).1612.

Skt. sattvadhatu is taken by most commentaries as “constitutions of sentient beings” (C also has “constitution” in IV.4a). However, as GC (528.4-5) points out, “the actual object of buddha activity is the stained tathagata heart of those to be guided.” See also lV.lOcd, which comments on IV.2c, saying that the basic element in all sentient beings is like a treasure seen by the buddhas.1614.1 follow MB and VT (fol. 15v7) nirmathya against J nispadya (referring to niryanam in IV.5; Schmithausen suggests nirydya).

Likewise, the rain of the wisdom of knowing what is subtle (emptiness) and the compassion of what is vast (generosity and so on) pours down equally on the fortunate who have faith in the mahàyàna, purifying their afflictions, and the unfortunate who have strong habitual tendencies of views about a self.1653.1 follow Takasakis emendation of MA/MB klesagatân drstyanusayân to klesagatàt- madrstyanusayân (supported by DP nyon mongs dag 'gyur bdag Ita’i bag chags and C).

Accord­ing to VT (fol. 17r4), “explaining the dharma” (dharmanuvada) refers to “engaging in commenting on the seven points such as the Buddha.” The first (temporary) result of this is the attainment of poised readiness (for profound true reality) on the bhumis of the noble ones in the mandala of the retinue of the tathagata Amitabha, with these bodhisattvas being the chief persons among those who have entered Amitabha’s retinue because they are noble ones. The second (ultimate) result of explaining the dharma is great awakening. In line V.28c, I follow J s reading of MA as dvidha (“twofold”), which is confirmed by VT (fol. 17r3) and DP rnam gnyis. Schmithausen suggests taking MA here (which is difficult to read) as “threefold” (tridha; as in C and Taisho 1595, 270b6) instead of “twofold.” For, he says, lines V.25cd enumerate three kinds of result: (1) see­ing Amitayus (“[attaining] the mandala of the retinue”), (2) the arising of the stainless eye of dharma (“[attaining] poised readiness”), and (3) attaining awakening. There­fore, Schmithausen also suggests reading MA “poised readiness in the mandala of the retinue” (parsanmandalaksantir) as “the mandala of the retinue, poised readiness . . . ” [parisanmandalam ksantir). However, it is difficult to take the phrase “by virtue of the arising of the stainless eye of dharma” (amaladharmacaksur udayat) in V.25d as a sep­arate result rather than as that through which awakening (the second result) is attained. In addition, the existence of three results is contradicted by VT s explicit comments on only two results, which are also found in all Tibetan commentaries.1717. DP add the following verse of dedication (as the entire RGW is traditionally at­tributed to Asanga) and a colophon indicating the translators:Through whatever inconceivable merit I attainedDue to explaining the precious genuine dharma of the supreme yana,May all beings become stainless vesselsFor the precious genuine dharma of the supreme yana.This completes the exposition of the Mahayanottaratantrasastra authored by the noble protector Maitreya, which was composed by master Asanga. It was translated by the great scholar, pandita Sajjana (the grandson of the great scholar, the Brahman Ratnavajra of glorious great Anupamapura), in that very [city] Anupamapura. Anupamapura is iden­tified by some as present-day Srinagar in Kashmir.1718. All topical headings are inserted by the translator (corresponding to my outline above). Though my translation sometimes differs from Kanos, I am indebted to both his translation and his Sanskrit edition of the text with critical apparatus (Kano 2006, 513-35), which in turn owe much to Profs. Schmithausen and Isaacson as well as Dr. Diwakar Acharya. Still, as Kano says, there remain unsolved problems in his edition. For this reason and also because of the sometimes very terse phrasing of the Sanskrit, both Kano s translation as well as mine are tentative in certain parts.1719. “The three methods” are the three yanas (see Uttaratantra 1.19).1720. “Common” probably means common to the three yanas, thus also alluding to the principle of a single ultimate yana as found in Uttaratantra 11.57-59."},{"pageNumber":1138,"pageContent":"1122 Notes1721. According to RGW on 1.19, the jewel of the Buddha is taught primarily for bodhi­sattvas, the dharma for pratyekabuddhas, and the samgha for sràvakas.1722. For the sake of correspondence, the line numbering of the interlinear glosses fol­lows the lines of verse in the English translation (due to the different syntax, the actual glosses in the Sanskrit are sometimes found in different lines, see Kano 2006, 513-18).1723. Skt. nihsreyasa means the truly best that consists of final liberation or ultimate bliss, that is, nirvâna.1724. That is, the purpose of teaching the ultimate refuge that is the Buddha is to cause the generation of bodhicitta through showing the ultimate goal or fruition of this bodhicitta.1725. “Those to be taken refuge in” refers to all three jewels.1726. According to RGW on 1.2 (J3.21—4.9), the jewel of the Buddha is attained on the eighth bhümi, the jewel of the dharma on the ninth bhümi, and the jewel of the samgha on the tenth bhümi.1727. See also verses 12-13 and the interlinear gloss on verse 15.1728. The meaning of adhikàraih here is not very clear (adhikâra can also mean “tide,” “rank,” “topic,” and “section”), but in the sense of authoritative properties, it seems to refer to the qualities of the samgha described in Uttaratantra 1.13-18.1729. Except for pravrtti, the first line of this gloss is illegible in the manuscript.1730. Read bhava for bhàva.1731. Given the interlinear gloss of this verse, “dharmas” most probably refers to the bud­dha qualities (vajra point 5).1732. Thus, verse 6 refers to the purification of the basic element (the cause) through the three conditions of awakening, its qualities, and its activity. “What is conducive to lib­eration” and “what is conducive to penetration” are names for the paths of accumu­lation and preparation, respectively. “The uninterrupted path” is defined as “the path that serves as the direct (or actual) remedy that relinquishes the obscurations of a given path and on which the arising of the subsequent wisdom that is the specific result of this path is not interrupted by anything other.” Thus, in general, each path (such as the path of seeing) has several uninterrupted paths, which alternate with the “paths of liberation” that represent the degrees of accomplished relinquishment subsequent to each uninterrupted path. Typically, uninterrupted paths and paths of liberation are only presented in the contexts of the path of seeing and the various levels of the path of familiarization. Thus, here, “uninterrupted path” seems to be a shorthand for these two paths.1733. The particle iti in bodhirgunàh karma ceti sâksâtpratyayam seems to suggest that the conditions consist of awakening and so on. However, Kano translates sâksât pratyayam as “directly and indirectly,” which is not impossible. Still, this could be understood in at least two ways. (1) In accordance with verse 12 and its interlinear gloss, the basic elements focal objects are the remaining six vajra points, with awakening, its qualities, and its activity being conditions. Thus, the three jewels could be considered as being directly perceptible to sentient beings, while the awakening of a buddha and so on would represent the (mostly not directly perceptible) conditions through which the three jewels become visible (on the other hand, verse 3 considers the three jewels also as conditions). (2) The awakening and the qualities of a buddha are the more indirect conditions for sentient beings’ entering and progressing on the path, while his enlight­ened activity is the more direct condition.1734. See also verses 25-26, which say that Uttaratantra 1.27-28 is the basis for engaging in reflection, while the ten topics (Uttaratantra 1.29-94) are the objects of meditation."},{"pageNumber":1139,"pageContent":"Notes 11231735. Skt. jinâèraya. Âêraya does not only mean “basis” or “ground,” but also “source,” “origin,” and “to depend on.” Thus, the welfare of sentient beings is contingent on a buddha whose enlightened activity is the source or origin of their attaining well-being, liberation, and buddhahood.1736. Skt. anuvrtti can also mean “to comply,” “to continue,” and “to follow.” As men­tioned above, this verse is an interesting reformulation or gloss of the first two reasons for all sentient beings’ possessing buddha nature in Uttaratantra 1.27 and 1.28. Line 8b corresponds to the first reason (“since buddha wisdom enters into the multitudes of beings” in I.27a and “because the perfect buddhakáya radiates” in 1.28a) and high­lights the intrinsic affinity between the buddha natures of buddhas and sentient be­ings, which enables the former to benefit the latter. Line 8c corresponds to the second reason (“since its stainlessness is nondual by nature” in I.27b and “because suchness is undifferentiable” in I.28b) and emphasizes the active nature of suchness when it is understood as buddha nature, which always engages in the welfare of sentient beings, be it in the form of external buddha activity or as the internal driving force for the path of ordinary beings and bodhisattvas to attaining buddhahood.1737. The first half of this note is corrupt (tad evam udghâtârtham ca sarïre navadhâtviyât /).1738. This is followed by illegible phrases and ends in nava . . . dhodâharanesu catus- tikâcâryâni dharmakàyâdïti, possibly related to Uttaratantra 1.85.1739. The term gotrasambhava is also found in RG W on Uttaratantra 1.28 (J26.9) and 1.41 (J37.3-4).1740. Lines 9cd can be understood as a further gloss on “because suchness is undifferentia­ble” in Uttaratantra I.28b. For, in its own nature, suchness is always free from any ad­ventitious stains, even in ordinary beings. These adventitious stains represent the dependent nature, whereas suchness is not dependent. Naturally, this strongly suggests an implicit equation of suchness with the perfect nature. Thus, the tathagata heart (suchness, the dharmadhàtu) is explicitly said here to be empty of the dependent nature (that is, mere conditioned appearances). Since it is even empty of the dependent na­ture, there is no question of its being empty of the imaginary nature (the seeming du­ality of apprehender and apprehended within mere conditioned appearances) too. In this context, it is significant what RGW ’ on 1.154-55 says about the relationship be­tween the tathagata heart and its adventitious stains, that is, “one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accor­dance with actual reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real exis­tent. These two verses elucidate the unmistaken defining characteristic of emptiness [in terms of the tathagata heart] since it [thus] is free from the extremes of superimposi­tion and denial.” This description of what is empty of what and what remains is remi­niscent of the Madhyântavibhâga’s treatment of the relationship between the dependent nature and the perfect nature. Madhyântavibhâga 1.1 says that duality does not exist in false imagination, while emptiness exists in false imagination as its fundamental nature. Generally, the text equates “false imagination” with the dependent nature and “empti­ness,” with the perfect nature. III.9 declares that the dependent nature is to be relin­quished, while the perfect nature is to be attained. According to the interlinear gloss on SM 9, the tathâgata heart is obscured by both afflictive and cognitive obscurations, which implies that both these obscurations are included in the dependent nature. As for the relationship between what is afflicted, all obscurations, and the dependent nature, the Uttaratantra often just uses “afflictions” for all obscurations in general. However, both the Uttaratantra and R G W also say that the tathâgata heart becomes free from"},{"pageNumber":1140,"pageContent":"1124 Notesboth afflictive and cognitive obscurations, with both being clearly defined and distin­guished (see II.3, II.6, 11.35-36, 11.45, IV.2, IV.6, and V.14). Though neither the Ut­taratantra nor RGW use the term “dependent (nature),” both texts employ many terms for the obscurations that can be considered as equivalents of the dependent na­ture, such as “false imagination” (1.63), “improper mental engagement” (1.56-57,1.60), “the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance” (1.138; a synonym of the alaya-con­sciousness, which is in turn often equated with the dependent nature in Yogacara texts). Uttaratantra 1.56-64 equates improper mental engagement with false imagination and says that it as well as the skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, karma, and afflictions produced by it (all being constituents of the conditioned dependent nature) rest on the purity of the mind, while the space-like luminous nature of the mind, which lacks causes and condi­tions, does not rest on any of these phenomena, nor is it produced or destroyed by them. On this, RGVV quotes the Gaganaganjapariprcchasutra, which says that all these phenomena are created by causes and conditions and cease once they are separated from these causes and conditions. In addition, it says, the afflictions are imagination (parikalpa), while the nature of the mind lacks imagination. Therefore, all phenomena are said to be completely devoid of any foundation. As for “the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance,” the Uttaratantra (1.37, 1.82, 1.87, and 11.34) says repeatedly that the tathagata heart is free from all latent tendencies and explicitly identifies the obscurations of awakening as the afflictions and their latent tendencies (IVY). RGVV on 1.82 and 1.130 comments on these latent tendencies as being “the ground of the la­tent tendencies of ignorance” (see also RGVV on 1.36). Also, the description of the obscurations as being adventitious, conditioned, like clouds, illusions, and so on, fits with the characterization of the dependent nature in other texts. For example, Ut­taratantra II.4 and II.6 say that buddhahood is like the sun and space, while the afflic­tive and cognitive obscurations, which are not established by any nature and are adventitious, are similar to clouds. On this, compare the interlinear note on SM verse 28 below, which explains that the examples of clouds, dreams, and illusions refer to the threefold afflictiveness of afflictions, karma, and birth, thus matching the deceptive na­ture of this threefold afflictiveness. Therefore, these examples refer to the afflictions’ not being established independently. By contrast, Uttaratantra I.86c states that buddha­hood is the ultimate reality whose “true nature is without falsity and deception.” Like­wise, 1.164 says that the stains are unreal (abhuta) because they are fabricated and adventitious, while the qualities are real (bhuta) because their nature is pure due to the identitylessness of these stains. As for the tathagata hearts being equivalent to the per­fect nature, many of the characteristics of the tathagata heart in the Uttaratantra are also found in other texts as describing the perfect nature, such as being changeless such­ness, unconditioned, unmistaken, nondual, unafflicted, stainless, space-like, and so on. Furthermore, the Indian texts (such as the two Brhattikds on the prajnaparamita sutras, the Bhagavatyamndydnusarini, and some works by Ratnakara^anti) that assert the Shentong model of the relationship between the three natures (the perfect nature’s be­ing empty of both the imaginary and dependent natures) not only identify the perfect nature with prajnaparamita but also repeatedly equate it with changeless and naturally pure suchness, minds natural luminosity, the tathagata heart, and so on, only obscured by adventitious stains and to be personally experienced by or as nonconceptual wis­dom. Some of these texts add that it is precisely the manner of the perfect natures being empty of the other two natures that is the reason for the perfect natures being referred to as being the true emptiness (in the sense of a truly existent remainder that is empty of something else), which corresponds well to RGVV’s explanation of what true"},{"pageNumber":1141,"pageContent":"Notes 1125emptiness means in the case of the tathâgata heart. Both these texts and R G W say that this true emptiness avoids the extremes of superimposition and denial. Naturally, R G W and some of these texts share the quote from the Cülasuññatasutta (see J76 and Brunnhôlzl 2011a, 35). In sum, SM 9 corresponds well to the classical Shentong posi­tion that the perfect nature is empty of both the imaginary and dependent natures. As mentioned above, the same can of course be said of the contents of Uttaratantra 1.155 in particular and many other passages in the Uttaratantra and RGW, which is further indicated by the equivalent terminologies and their relationships in the Uttaratantra and RG W as already indicated. Finally, note that klistaparatantra in SM 9d could also be read as “the afflicted dependent.” This could either mean that the dependent is af­flicted in nature (thus being identical in meaning to the above translation of this line) or that there is also a nonafflicted or pure dependent, as for example found in the ninth and tenth chapters of the Mahâyânasamgraha, which is basically an equivalent of the perfect nature. Some Tibetan shentong teachings indeed equate the pure dependent na­ture with the tathâgata heart and the impure dependent nature with its obscurations, but a correspondence to that in the Uttaratantra with its consistent description of the tathâgata heart and its obscurations being fundamentally different and disconnected is not something that is obvious.1741. Skt. visvatra can also mean “everywhere.” However, given the contrast to the accom­plished disposition’s not existing always in the next lines and the close connection of this verse with Uttaratantra 1.149, “always” seems preferable.1742. Thus, unlike most other texts, SM defines the accomplished or unfolding disposition rather narrowly as existing only from the path of seeing onward (that is, once the natu­rally abiding disposition is seen directly for the first time on the first bhùmi) but not on the paths of accumulation and preparation.1743. Since this threefold classification of the disposition is also found in verse 15 (tathatàprakrtâvasthasamânïtatrigotrakah), it is probably Sajjana’s own. Though SM does not explain the differences between the disposition that is suchness and the other two, one may assume that the former refers to the disposition as such, that is, just as it is on its own (suchness) and without any classificatory divisions.1744. Kano takes anatirekin as a synonym of avyatireka (“do not contradict” or “do not exclude”), which may be suitable in terms of the meaning here. However, he relates it to J °avyatirekatah in Uttaratantra I.45b, while (as already pointed out) J s reading is to be replaced by MB °bhinnavrttitah.1745. See Uttaratantra 1.3.1746. See Uttaratantra 1.26.1747. See the interlinear glosses on verse 3.1748. There follows an illegible passage in the manuscript.1749. This could also be read as “is the goal in which awakening, the qualities, and activity are in their natural order” or “means that awakening, the qualities, and activity are in their natural order.”1750. The double occurrence of kva after both trikâyïm and dharmakâyatrayïm indicates a strong contrast between the two.1751. See the interlinear glosses on 3b as well as verses 4 and 14.1752. See Uttaratantra I.30ab and 1.31.1753. See Uttaratantra I.30cd and 1.32-34. The naturally abiding disposition comes to life through four causes—faith in the dharma, supreme prajñá, the bliss of samadhi, and great compassion.1754.

As RG W on 1.36 explains, the fruitions that consist of the four paramitas of purity, self, bliss, and permanence are the respective opposites of, or remedies for, being hostile toward the mahayana dharma (those with great desire), lacking the supreme prajñá (tirthikas), being afraid of samsáric suffering (¿rávakas), and lacking compassion (pratyekabuddhas).1756. See Uttaratantra I.35cd and 40-41. One engages in the path by virtue of the function of the tathagata heart, that is, weariness of suffering and striving for nirvana.1757. The phrase sdstyasya is ambiguous. It could also be read as “is related to those to be instructed.”1758. See Uttaratantra 1.45-46. See also the interlinear gloss after 20ab.1759. According to RGW on Uttaratantra 1.42-44, “endowment” consists of being en­dowed with three causal qualities (the causes of the purity of the dharmakaya, the at­tainment of buddha wisdom, and a tathagata’s great compassion engaging all beings) and three resultant qualities (the supernatural knowledges, the wisdom of the termina­tion of contaminations, and the termination of contaminations).1760. See Uttaratantra 1.47-50.1761. See Uttaratantra 1.51-83 (in particular 1.66-78 on the changelessness of the tathagata heart in bodhisattvas).1762. See Uttaratantra 1.84-94, which teaches that the tathagata heart is inseparable from all the qualities of a perfect buddha and thus is identical to the result of the path (the dharmakaya or ultimate nirvana).1763. Compare the long note on verse 28, which says that everything conditioned is neces­sarily empty but luminous mind is not conditioned (and thus not empty).1764. See verse 11.1765. For the correlations of the nine examples of a buddha in a decaying lotus and so on with nine kinds of obscurations, see Uttaratantra I.130-43ab and R GW on Uttaratan­tra 1.130-31. However, neither the Uttaratantra nor R G W spell out the relationship of these nine obscurations with the ten topics as they are correlated here in verses 20-22 and their interlinear notes.1766. See 17d.1767. See the interlinear gloss on verse 17.1768. See the interlinear glosses on verses 3 and 13.1769. For the detailed correlations between the ten topics and the nine kinds of afflictions, see the introductory discussion of SM s soteriological approach.1770. Skt. auddhatya can also mean “insolence” and “disdain.”1771. Skt. nirveda can also mean “disregard of worldly objects” or “disgust.”1772. Uttaratantra I.143cd-52 presents the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition (“the threefold nature”) in relation to the nine examples. See also Uttaratantra 1.28.1773. According to the interlinear gloss, bháva is used in the sense of svablmva (the scribeof the manuscript deleted sva- probably for reasons of meter).1774. The term apavádadrstánta means that the nine examples of a buddha in a decaying lotus and so on in Uttaratantra I.96-143ab teach the tathagata heart by way of refut­ing or denying (apaváda) the real existence of its various obscurations, which can be removed.1775. Again, the Uttaratantra does not spell out any correlations between the ten topics and the nine examples. However, in analogy to the correlation between the ten topics and the nine kinds of afflictions (which correspond to the nine examples) as outlined in verses 20-22, the ten topics and the nine examples can be correlated as they were in the introductory discussion."},{"pageNumber":1143,"pageContent":"Notes 11271776. Thereafter, the manuscript is illegible but for the phrase vidharmatâ yukti.1777. That is, “the threefold nature” of dharmakàya, suchness, and the disposition.1778. According to the interlinear gloss on verse 26, “the summarized meaning” refers to Uttaratantra 1.27.1779. Skt. vyakti can also mean “distinctness.”1780. This is followed by esa (phalyâm vâdanesu?) nâsti/ and a (mostly illegible) reference to Uttaratantra 1.28: kâyaspharanâdi... sa bahu ...1781. That is, in Uttaratantra 1.144-52.1782. Note that this verse from the Abhidharmamahàyànasütra still belongs to the expla­nation of the disposition in Uttaratantra 1.149-52. The last section in the first chapter (Uttaratantra 153-67) begins right after RGVV’s comments on this verse (J73.9-78.20).1783. See the interlinear note on verse 19, which explicitly says that the dharmadhatu is changeless because it is nonempty, unbound, inexhaustible, and unceasing, which is its intrinsic nature of nonconceptuality.1784. Unlike ordinary states of mind—primary minds and mental factors (citta and caitta)—which are usually described as being contingent on four conditions (object condition, dominant condition, immediate condition, and causal condition), luminous mind is not conditioned by anything other; the sole factor for its continuous arising is nothing but a previous instance of that very luminous mind. Accordingly, by virtue of its being unconditioned, luminous mind is not empty, unlike conditioned phenomena, which do not exist 011 their own but are only adventitious stains that are just as unreal as clouds, dreams, and illusions. Thus, buddha nature does not arise from anything nor is it produced by anything. Rather, it is merely revealed by realizing that the stains are illusory and never really existed in the first place.1785. See Uttaratantra 1.158-59.1786. This refers to the parts of the following syllogism: “The afflictiveness of afflictions, karma, and birth (subject of the probandum) is empty (probandum), because it is con­ditioned (reason), just like clouds, dreams, and illusions (examples).”1787. This refers to the following passage in RGVV (J33.10-11): “For as long as they do not perceive the tathàgata element, which becomes apparent due to the cessation of all afflictiveness in terms of affliction, karma, and birth without exception, they are not free from the death that is an inconceivable transformation.” As mentioned before, Skt. samudbhüta can mean “becoming visible,” “arising,” and “being produced.”1788. Skt. pratyâyana can also mean “to console.”1789. This is the answer to the objection in RGVV (J77.9-10) preceding Uttaratantra I.156ff.: “If this basic element so difficult to behold is not an object in its entirety even for the supreme noble ones who dwell on the bhümi that is completely free from attach­ment, what is the point of this instruction [on the basic element] for [anybody below these bodhisattvas,] beginning with naive beings?”1790. See RGW (J4.21-5.7), verses 3 and 13, and the interlinear glosses on verses 3 and 15.1791. As the next two verses will explain, among the eight topics of awakening in Ut­taratantra II. 1-2, (1) nature (purity), (3) fruition (freedom), (4) function (one’s own welfare and that of others), and (6) manifestation (profundity, vastness, and magna­nimity) refer to the qualities of awakening, while (2) cause (attainment), (5) endow­ment (the foundation of the function), (7) permanence (for as long as time lasts), and (8) inconceivability (in accordance with beings) serve to eliminate superimpositions onto awakening.1792. This seems to refer to the two kinds of wisdom of meditative equipoise and subse­quent attainment that are mentioned as the causes of awakening in II.7 and in R G W"},{"pageNumber":1144,"pageContent":"1128 Noteson “attainment” in II.l. Since these two wisdoms are causes, they must cease before their result (awakening) manifests.1793. According to Uttaratantra III.1-3, the dharmakaya possesses the thirty-two quali­ties of freedom, which serve as the foundation of one’s own welfare. The rüpakäya is endowed with the thirty-two qualities of maturation, which serve as the foundation of the welfare of others.1794. See RGW on 1.24: “The activity of the victors consists of the distinct unsurpassable activities of these very buddha attributes (such as the ten powers), continuing to give prophesying speeches about bodhisattvas in an endless, uninterrupted, and unceasing manner” (J21.11-13) and on 1.26: “It is these very branches of awakening that cause the awakening of others—the fourth point of what causes awakening” (J25.13—15).1795. See RGW on Uttaratantra 1.14-16.1796. The six topics of (1) deliverance, (2) the support of that deliverance, (3) the result of that support, (4) taking hold of that result, (5) the obscurations of such taking hold, and(6) the condition for eliminating these obscurations in Uttaratantra IV.5 are discussed in Uttaratantra IV.1-12. These six correspond to the aspect of “knowing variety.” The nine examples of Sakra and so on for buddha activity in Uttaratantra IV. 13 are then explained in detail in IV. 14-98 and correspond to the aspect of “knowing suchness.”1797. Skt. sailanirdesa. According to Takasaki (1989, ii), this term refers to the main body of the Uttaratantra or Ratnagotravibhäga, with saila standing for gotra in the sense of a mountain that is a “mine” of jewels (ratna). Also, the term is reminiscent of the Ti­betan “mountain dharma” (ri chos) genre, which consists of pithy instruction manuals on doing meditation retreats in remote mountain areas without performing elaborate rituals. Given its pithy contemplative approach, SM could certainly be considered as such a retreat manual. In addition, this characterization accords with Dsen Kawochd’s having requested a “death dharma” when he met Sajjana, upon which Sajjana taught him the Uttaratantra and the other four texts of Maitreya, possibly providing SM as the quintessence of what to contemplate in retreat or at death.1798. Uttaratantra V. 1-19.1799. Uttaratantra V.20-24.1800. Kano translates these two lines as “Followers [of the RGV] keep enjoying the blessing without interruption,” taking drstvä... vartante to mean “keep doing.” Another option he gives is “After reading the [verses of] blessing, reciters [of the verses] continuously stand by [the blessing].”1801. In Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, ädinava can also mean “evil,” “misery,” “danger,” and “wretchedness.”1802. Skt. svakriyä could also be read as “means/expedient for oneself.”1803. Uttaratantra V.25. For the first three lines of verse 37, compare Uttaratantra V.16.1804. CMW sei emended to gsal1805. In SM, as already mentioned, and also in CMW, these are the three natures of the dhar­makaya, suchness, and the disposition, as listed in Uttaratantra I.143cd-144/146cd-147.1806. Thus, the first pith instruction refers to the first three vajra points (the three jewels), the second one to the fourth vajra point (the basic element), and the third one to the last three vajra points (awakening, the qualities, and activity). As for the term “concep­tion” (Skt. vikalpa, Tib. rnam rtog) in the third instruction, it is obviously used here in the vaster Buddhist sense of referring to the entirety of the dualistic constructions, appearances, and experiences of the deluded minds of ordinary beings (the same goes for “thought”). This wider sense of the term is particularly common in the Yogäcära system, as for example in the Dharmadharmatävibhäga, which presents the entirety of"},{"pageNumber":1145,"pageContent":"Notes 1129phenomena as being nothing but the multiple expressions of “false imagination,” all of which are equivalent to adventitious stains. In that vein, Uttaratantra I.63cd says that all adventitious stains arise from false imagination. Also, RG W (J12) explains: “‘Conception’ refers to improper mental engagement, the cause of the arising of karma and the afflictions. By virtue of realizing the natural cessation of this [improper mental engagement], there is no manifestation of the duo [of karma and the afflictions] or conception. Consequently, there is absolutely no arising of suffering. This is called ‘the reality of the cessation of suffering.’ However, it is not that the reality of the cessation of suffering is explained by virtue of the destruction of any phenomenon.” On the other hand, Uttaratantra V.14 differentiates between afflictive obscurations and cognitive ob­scurations, saying that the latter are “conceptions in terms of the three spheres.” The Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkdra (Brunnholzl 2010,589-90) further comments on the meaning of “conception,” explaining that the obscurations to be relinquished by bodhisattvas are nothing but conceptions in the widest sense, and also resolves what V.14 says: “Bodhisattvas do not cultivate the remedy for the latencies of the afflictions in a deliberate way because they do not strive for the peace of having relinquished these [latencies]. You may wonder, ‘What do they relinquish then?’ They only relinquish the conceptions that represent cognitive obscurations. For this reason, it is said that the vinaya of bodhisattvas is what tames nothing but conceptions. You may ask, ‘Do they not relinquish the latencies of the afflictions at all?’ This is not the case. For when they deliberately relinquish the antagonistic factors of the bodhisattva path [of familiarization] (the 108 conceptions that are cognitive obscurations), they simultaneously relinquish the 108 latencies of the afflictions [too]. Thus, at this time, they do not have to cultivate an uncontaminated remedy for the latencies of the afflic­tions apart from [their path of familiarization]. For, in terms of general isolates, con­ceptions are cognitive obscurations, but they also represent the afflictive obscurations of bodhisattvas. Therefore, through primarily relinquishing conceptions, as a matter of course, [bodhisattvas] also relinquish the afflictive obscurations. With this in mind, venerable Vasubandhu declared [in his Mahdyanasutrdlamkarabhdsya on 1.5; D4026, fol. 132a.3]: ‘The afflictions of bodhisattvas are conceptions.’” Note that the last sen­tence is also found in Asvabhava’s Mahdydnasutrdlamkaratika on VIII.la (D4029, fol. 63a.7-63b.l). On this, see also CMW’s saying that all factors to be relinquished on the five paths are conceptions (418), that the two obscurations are conceptions (420), and that the three main afflictions desire, hatred, and ignorance (and thus by implication all afflictions) consist of nothing but latent and manifest conceptions (495). The Fifth Shamarpa s commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkdra (Brunnholzl 2011b, 274-75) ex­plains conception as follows: “[Conception] is what obscures the disposition for nir­vana (the alaya-wisdom). It has the nature of being the consciousness that entails the dualistic appearances of apprehender and apprehended. This possesses [many] names, such as alaya-consciousness, impure dependent [nature], nonafflicted ignorance, sen­tient being, and false imagination. Just as dreams arise from being asleep, certain coarse [forms of] apprehender and apprehended [arise] from this [conception or false imagi­nation and] are seized as a self by the afflicted mind. Through this, afflictions (such as attachment) [arise], which in turn lead to accumulating various karmas. Thus, we ex­perience suffering. [The conceptions that] apprehend by conflating terms and their ref­erents cling to certain more subtle [forms of apprehender and apprehended] as being different in substance, same in substance, and so on. By virtue of that, the conceptions in terms of the three spheres arise and one falls into [the nirvana of personal] peace. In this way, cloud-like adventitious stains obscure space-like suchness.” As for sentient"},{"pageNumber":1146,"pageContent":"1130 Notesbeings’ being equated here by the Fifth Shamarpa with the obscurations, ignorance, and so on, see also CMW (416) and the related note.1807.

The Uttaratantra speaks of a wish-fulfilling jewel instead of gold, using it to illustrate the power of the basic element, while water symbolizes the moisture of compassion. However, the examples of space, gold, and water appear with the same or similar meanings as in CMW in many other Yogacara texts, such as the conclud­ing lines of the Dharmadharmatavibhdga (299-300), Mahdyanasutrdlamkara XI. 13, Madhyantavibhaga 1.16, Asanga’s ViniscayasamgrahanI (D4038, vol. zi, fols. 14b.5- 15a.l and 123b.5-124a.l), Vasubandhus Dharmadharmatavibhagavrtti (D4028, fol. 38a.3-38b.5), Mahdydnasutrdlamkarabhasya (D4026, fol. 168a.3-6), and Madhyan- tavibhagabhasya (D4027, fol. 4b.4-6), as well as Sthiramati’s Sutralamkdravrttibhasya (D4034, vol. mi, fols. 75a.3-5 and 174a.l-174b.l) and Madhyantavibhagatika (Pandeya ed., 1999, 40.5-41.15; D4032, fols. 214a.6-215a.2). For details, see Brunnholzl 2012b, 440n781.1818.1.154/157.1819. CMWs version of this line reads: “With the treasure of jewels lodged within the mind of sentient beings . . . ” Throughout CMW, all quotations from the Uttaratantra are translated by following the Tibetan canonical version.1820.1.113/116.1821.

As is clear from the preceding paragraph, the third main point (C) of CMWs intro­duction refers to the fifth, sixth, and seventh vajra points in the Uttaratantra. However, CMW’s explanation of the subpoints Cl and C2 discusses awakening (vajra point 5) in combination with the basic element (vajra point 4), saying that the cause and the fruition are not different. Subpoints Cl and C2 are explained together in eight parts (essence, cause, fruition, function, qualities/purpose, resolving its manifestation, re­solving its being everlasting, and resolving its inconceivability), which correspond to the eight topics through which awakening is explained in the second chapter of the Uttaratantra. However, explicitly or implicitly, this explanation also includes all ten topics through which the basic element is presented in Uttaratantra I.29-95ab. As al­ready mentioned, the ten topics of the basic element and the eight topics of awakening share the six topics of nature, cause, fruition, function, endowment (with qualities), and manifestation, with the remaining four and two, respectively, being elaborations of the sixth one. Among the remaining four topics that discuss the basic element, the three topics “phases,” “all-pervasiveness,” and “inseparability” are included in this section of CMW at the beginning of Cl-2, while the topic “changeless qualities” is included in Cl-2b and Cl-2e. The topic “inseparability” is also discussed under C3. The combined approach to both the basic element and awakening in this section of CMW is further highlighted by its use of citations from the first chapter of the Uttaratantra that are related to the basic element.1829. CMW byang chub (which would be exactly the same as the next point) is emended to rigs (it could also be khams—“basic element”—but then “basic element” would appear twice in this heading).1830.1.155ab/158ab.1831.

However, these two cases are spelled bshig pa and gshig pa, respectively, with bshigpa meaning “to destroy” or “to annihilate.” Though in Mahâmudrâ meditation the scru­tinizing of thoughts through nonconceptual wisdom in the sense of directly looking at their nature does not mean to “destroy” thoughts, through looking at their nature, thoughts dissolve naturally on their own. Thus, “scrutinizing” and “dissolving” are very closely related here. Still, for the sake of consistency, all three cases are translated as “scrutinizing.” Furthermore, as CMW says in the text below, during the process of thoughts’ being scrutinized by nonconceptual wisdom, there is still some effort, whereas here, once they have been scrutinized and thus have dissolved, there is no more effort.1836. In accordance with the passage in the text above, CMW bshig is emended to gzhig.1837. As mentioned already, “separating the pure essence (Tib. dvangs ma) from the dross (Tib. snyigs ma)” is a typical vajrayana presentation, referring to distinguishing be­tween wisdom and ordinary dualistic consciousness. Also, CMW’s passage here is very similar to Dzogchen instructions about distinguishing between mind (sems) and basic awareness (rigpa).1838.

Given that CMW’s introduction accords so much with teachings on Mahâmudrâ, it is quite peculiar that CMW here uses the term tha mal gyi shes pa not in its classical sense as the key term of Mahâmudrâ (referring to mind’s nature in its natural uncontrived state, and then usually translated as “ordinary mind”) but in the sense of the truly ordi­nary states of mind that obscure minds nature.1844.

Mahäyänasüträlamkära 11.10 speaks about the four characteristics of the virtue of bodhisattvas due to which they outshine srävakas, with the last characteristics be­ing that their virtue is “masterful.” According to the commentaries by Vasubandhu (Mahäyänasüträlamkärabhäsya, D4026, fol. 136b2) and Asvabhäva (Mahäyänasamgra- hopanibandhana, D4029, fol. 50a5), this virtue is masterful because it does not even become exhausted in the nirvàna without any remainder of the skandhas. Sthiramati’s commentary Süträlamkäravrttibhäsya (D4034, fois. 38b.7-39a.l) says that on the bud- dhabhümi, bodhisattvas attain all consummate qualities such as the powers, fearless­nesses, and unique buddha qualities, while the skandhas subside. Even though buddhas have entered the nirvàna in which all remainders of the skandhas without exception have been relinquished, these qualities never become exhausted or reach an end.1862. This paragraph refers to Uttaratantra IV.1-11.1863. This refers to Uttaratantra IV. 12.1864. An unknown amount of text is missing here at the beginning of CMW’s actual com­ments on the Uttaratantra since p. 423 in the hard copy of CMW starts in the middle of an unknown argument (probably about seemingly real entities being empty, while buddha nature is ultimately existent). This argument is phrased in terms of the triad of “basis of intention,” “purpose,” and “invalidation of the explicit statement” (the typical"},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"Notes 1133three criteria that are considered to determine a teaching as being of expedient mean­ing). The first two points of this triad are obviously missing in the text, but the extent of the entire missing passage is not clear. I tried to gain access to a copy of the original manuscript in the possession of the head of the Drikung Kagyü School, Chetsang Rin­poche, in order to see whether the passage in question as well as two more are missing in the original too, but this proved to be impossible.1865.

As already mentioned, this verse is not found in the Lahkâvatârasütra. It is a slightly varied rendering of the Tibetan version of an anonymous verse quoted in RGVV (J37). As stated before, Jamgôn Kongtrul Lodro Tayé’s commentary on the Third Karmapas Pointing Out the Tathagata Heart (Kong sprul bio gros mtha yas 1990, 133) says that this verse is from the Abhidharmamahàyànasütra.1867.

This is a slightly paraphrased version of Sthiramati, Madhyântavibhâgatïkâ, Pandeya ed., 1999, 5.5-6 and 250.9 (D4032, fols. 192b.3-4 and 288a.5). The seven greatnesses of the mahayana are described in the same text (Pandeya ed., 1999, 250.10-16; D4032, fols. 288a.5-288b.2) as follows: (1) Greatness of focus means that bodhisattvas focus on the vast collection of mahayana scriptures, such as the prajnâpâramitâsütra in one hundred thousand lines. (2) Greatness of accomplishment is the accomplishment of ones own welfare and that of others. (3) Greatness of wisdom is the realization of both personal and phenomenal identitylessness. (4) Greatness of vigor is to make efforts in many difficult tasks on the path for three incalculable eons. (5) Greatness of skill in means refers to bodhisattvas’ not abiding in either samsara or nirvana. (6) Greatness of attainment means to attain countless infinite qualities, such as the powers, fearless­nesses, and unique buddha qualities. (7) Greatness of enlightened activity means to accomplish the deeds of a buddha through displaying awakening for as long as samsara lasts. The same seven are also found in Mahâyânasütrâlamkâra XIX.59-60, which var­ies in explaining (4) as bodhisattvas from the first bhümi onward being permitted to commit the seven negative actions of body and speech, because they, due to their stain­less bodhicitta, never forsake any sentient being and are not subject to afflictions. (5) is called “perfect accomplishment” and means to attain the thirty-two qualities of the dharmakaya. (7) refers to the effortless, spontaneous, and ceaseless activity for the sake of all beings. GC (11.13-19) says that these seven greatnesses are also taught in the Ut­taratantra: (1) in V.15cd, (2) in I.39ab, (3) in 1.13b, (4)-(5) in II.62ab, (6) in the chapter on the qualities, and (7) in the chapter on enlightened activity. Likewise, the threefold greatness that is the aim of the path in Abhisamayâlamkâra I.43ab is also explained in the Uttaratantra. (1) Great mind is found in IV.2c, (2) great relinquishment in IV.2d, and (3) great realization in 1.26a.1871. 1.7. The Mahâyânasütrâlamkârabhàsya (D4026, fol. 132b. 1-2) comments that sentient beings are matured through the vastness of the power (of a buddhas) be­ing demonstrated because beings then make efforts due to their faith in this power. Teaching the profound develops nonconceptual (wisdom). Therefore, this mahayana, in which these two features are taught, is the means for unsurpassable wisdom. For, through these two features, it respectively matures sentient beings and matures one’s own buddha attributes."},{"pageNumber":1150,"pageContent":"1134 Notes1872. These three are (1) being a definiendum, (2) being established based on its own in­stances, and (3) not functioning as a definiendum for something other than its own definition.1873. Given the context, CMW btags pa ba mayin te mtshan nyid pa yin na is emended to btags pa bayin te mtshan nyid pa mayin na.1874. Note that CMW does not answer the third question in the text above: “If it is a nom­inal [tantra] and does not actually fulfill the definition [of tantra], what valid cognition is there that invalidates the explicit [expression ‘tantra’]?”1875. Among the two syllables of the Sanskrit word sastra for treatise, éás means “teach­ing,” “correcting,” “punishing,” or “ordering,” while tra means “protecting” or “rescu­ing.” As for its Tibetan equivalent bstan bcos, bstan means “teaching” and bcos means “restoring,” “mending,” “curing,” and “correcting.” All of these meanings are used in the explanations of this term in CMW in the text below and in Sthiramati’s Madhyánta- vibhñgatiká (Pandeya ed., 1999,4.7-20; D4032, fol. 190a.3-190b.2), which says, “Nowit is to be explained what the nature of a treatise is and why it is called ‘treatise.’ A treatise consists of the cognizances that appear as the collections of names, words, and letters. Or a treatise consists of the cognizances that appear as the special sounds (or terms) that cause one to attain supramundane wisdom. How do cognizances guide one or express [something]? The cognizances of the listener arise due to the cognizance of the guide and explainer. Therefore, there is no flaw here. [By virtue of a treatise,] learning dharma practitioners give rise to specific [forms of] discipline, samadhi, and prajñá, therefore refraining from unfavorable actions of body, speech, and mind and engaging in favorable actions. Or it is a treatise because it is tenable as [fulfilling] the [etymologi­cal] defining characteristic of a treatise. The defining characteristic of a treatise is being a pith instruction (upadeéa) that, through repeatedly bringing it to mind, relinquishes all afflictions including their latent tendencies and rescues one from the lower realms that are frightful due to all kinds of intense, uninterrupted, and long-lasting suffering as well as from [samsáric] existence [in general]. Therefore, because it corrects the ene­mies of the afflictions and rescues (samtara) one from the lower realms and [samsáric] existence, it has the defining characteristic of a treatise. These [two features of correct­ing afflictions and rescuing from samsara] exist in the entire maháyána and everything that explains it but not elsewhere. Thus, this [text] is a treatise. On this, it is said:What corrects the enemies of the afflictions without exceptionAnd rescues from existences in lower realmsIs a treatise by virtue of the qualities of correcting and protecting.These two [qualities] do not exist in other systems.”The variant readings in this passage are as follows. “Guide” (D4032 mdzad); “cog­nizances of the listener” (D nyan pdi rnam par rig pa mams Pandeya “instructions” [prajñaptínám]); “the guide” (D mdzad pa po); “correcting [tás] learning dharma prac­titioners” (Pandeya éisya dharmiko D slob ma ’chos pdi phyir); “through having famil­iarized” (Pandeya omits this phrase); “there is no flaw here” (D adds “It is a treatise because it sustains learners” [slob ma ’chos pdi phyir bstan bcos te /]); “it is a treatise because it is tenable as [fulfilling] the [etymological] defining characteristic of a trea­tise” (Pandeya sásanác chdstram / D bstan bcos kyi mtshan nyid du ’thadpdi phyir bstan bcos te f); “a pith instruction that, through repeatedly bringing it to mind, relinquishes all afflictions including their latent tendencies” (Pandeya yad upadeso bhasamdna sar- vaklesaprahánáya0 D lung mnos pa goms par byas pas bag changs dang bcas pdi nyon mongs); “it corrects” (Pandeya sdsana D ’chos pa).

According to the comments on Abhisamayälamkära IV.39-59 by Äryavimuktisena and Haribhadra (whom virtually all Tibetan commentators follow), bodhisattvas who are of sharpest faculties and ex­hibit the corresponding signs of irreversibility are irreversible with regard to achieving buddhahood already from the path of preparation onward. Those who are of medium faculties and exhibit the corresponding signs are irreversible from the paths of see­ing and familiarization onward. Those who are of dull faculties and exhibit the corre­sponding signs are irreversible only from the eighth bhümi onward. See also CMW in the text below (462).1882. “Five aspects” refers to the five aspects of the constitutions of those to be guided and so on in the last three lines of Uttaratantra IV. 1, which is quoted right below in the text.1883. CMW dang emended to kyi.1884. These are (1) the five skandhas, (2) the eighteen dhätus, (3) the twelve äyatanas, (4) the four realities of the noble ones, (5) dependent origination, and (6) what is and what is not the case.1885. In addition to CMWs speaking of the ultimate and the seeming aspects of the three jewels, YDC (242) says that according to the former mighty lords of supreme knowledge (interlinear note: Chaba [Chökyi Sengé]), all seven vajra points are twofold in terms of ultimate and seeming. The ultimate Buddha consists of the expanse and wisdom that are free from all stains, while the seeming consists of the two rüpakäyas. The ultimate dharma consists of cessation and the path, while the seeming consists of the words of the Buddha. The ultimate samgha consists of the noble learners who are endowed with the qualities of awareness and liberation, while the seeming consists of ordinary beings who have properly entered the teachings. The ultimate basic element consists of the naturally abiding disposition, while the seeming consists of the unfolding disposition. The division of awakening corresponds to what was said about the Buddha; or the ulti­mate awakening consists of the wisdom of knowing the suchness of the expanse, while the seeming consists of the wisdom of knowing the variety of the ten powers and so on. The ultimate qualities consist of the qualities of freedom, while the seeming consist of the qualities of maturation. The ultimate enlightened activity consists of all-accom­plishing wisdom, while the seeming consists of the three kinds of emanation that arise from it. However, though these divisions are the case in general, the meaning that is found in the commentaries on the intention of the Uttaratantra is not clearly stated in such a way. GC (14.13-22) also speaks of the ultimate and seeming aspects of the vajra points. The ultimate three jewels are taught in Uttaratantra 1.21. The seeming Buddha is taught through the seeming kâyas for the welfare of others (the rüpakäyas), while the seeming dharma and samgha are found in 1.20. Through teaching the tathägata heart that is explained as the principle of emptiness, the ultimate suchness with stains is explained. The seeming suchness with stains or tathägata heart is explained through the unfolding disposition, such as in I.40ab. In the sixth topic of awakening (manifesta­tion), the sväbhävikakäya is taught as ultimate awakening, while the two rüpakäyas are"},{"pageNumber":1152,"pageContent":"1136 Notesthe seeming one. The ultimate qualities are the thirty-two qualities of freedom, while the seeming qualities are the thirty-two of maturation. The ultimate enlightened activ­ity is the dharmakaya as the sovereign of such activity, while the seeming one consists of the two rüpakàyas. GC (19.17-20.9) also identifies the seven vajra points in general as follows. The Buddha refers to the svàbhàvikakâya, sambhogakàya, and nirmanakaya, with the latter two being labeled “buddha” due to their similarity with a buddha in order to give rise to respect for masters and physical representations of buddhas. Fur­thermore, the name “buddha” is applied to buddhas on the path of nonlearning and bodhisattvas on the tenth bhümi, and R G W also refers to bodhisattvas from the eighth bhùmi onward as buddhas. Among the ten meanings of the term “dharma,” here three apply: the path, nirvana, and the discourses of the Buddha. The samgha refers to the ultimate samgha that consists of liberation and cessation. The psychophysical supports for that—noble bodhisattvas, šrávakas, and pratyekabuddhas—are also referred to as samgha. The meaning of the term “basic element” is the source that is the substantial cause of the final result. Here, it is explained as the disposition for the pure appearances of the three jewels and the impure appearances of samsara, respectively. “Awakening” applies to flaws having been purified and phenomena’s having been realized. Thus, like the term “buddha,” it applies to everybody from the eighth bhùmi onward. The qual­ities refer to those such as the ten powers that clearly distinguish a buddha from other teachers. They also apply to everybody from the eighth bhùmi onward. Enlightened activity means that everything from worldly virtue up through achieving buddhahood is to be accomplished through the assistance of others who are buddhas. As a case of labeling the cause with the name of the result, the causes of this activity—wisdom and compassion—are also called “enlightened activity.”1886. CMW gzhir emended to bzhir.1887. Compared to this phrase at the beginning of R G W ’s comments on 1.26, CMW omits “topical points” but adds “they are definite as four.” The Tibetan of citations from R G W in CMW usually follow RGW (D). However, for reasons of consistency and easy identification of such citations in my translation of RGW, all citations in CMW are rendered in accordance with my translation of R G W from the Sanskrit (as in this case, significant variants are noted). Also, when CMW provides only the beginning and the ending words of a quote, the English rendering and the Tibetan often do not match since the word order is different in English.1888. As mentioned before, the Uttaratantra teaches two different models of the causal relationship between the seven vajra points. Model (1) in 1.3 identifies the three jewels and the basic element as causes (or as three conditions and one cause, respectively) and the last three vajra points as results. Model (2) in 1.23 and 1.26 as well as RGW on 1.2 describes the basic element as the cause, the last three vajra points as conditions, and the three jewels as results. The beginning of Ngog Lotsàwa’s commentary (Rngog lo tsâ ba bio ldan shes rab 1993b, fols. 2a.2-6a.5) elaborates on these two models and calls them (1) “the cycle of the nonabiding nirvana” and (2) “the cycle of the three jewels” (for details, see Kano 2006, 136-47 and 370-82). YDC (244-45) uses almost identical terms for these two cycles (“the cycle of nirvana” and “the cycle of the three jewels”) in terms of the relationship between the seven vajra points and their definite number but otherwise differs in several points from Ngog. (1) In terms of the cycle of the three jew­els, the vajra points are definite as seven—the three that are results and the four that are the cause and the conditions. The three jewels are definite as the three results because they are the objects of refuge that are the results of those who wish for liberation, who are definite as having three dispositions (šrávakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas)."},{"pageNumber":1153,"pageContent":"Notes 1137Or, the three jewels are gradually accomplished on the last three bhümis (see RGW ; J3-4), while all three are perfectly accomplished on the buddhabhümi. As for the cause and the conditions being definite as four, the basic element is the substantial cause, while the remaining three vajra points are the cooperating conditions. Here, there are two modes in which this happens: (a) the close causes included in a single mind stream and (b) the distant causes included in different mind streams, (la) The basic element from the path of accumulation up through the seventh bhümi is the cause. The triad of profound awakening on the eighth bhümi, the qualities of wisdom on the ninth bhümi, and consummate enlightened activity on the tenth bhümi represents the three condi­tions. Through these four that are the cause and the conditions coming together at the end of the continuum of the ten bhümis, the three jewels are directly accomplished, (lb) The basic element in one’s own mind stream during the time of its not having awakened is the cause. The triad of awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity that has already manifested in the mind stream of someone else represents the condi­tions. This is so for the following reasons. By virtue of profound awakening, that other awakened person teaches one the profound and by virtue of the qualities, the vast. By virtue of enlightened activity, one is made to directly engage in these two. In that way, the three jewels are accomplished progressively by virtue of the awakening of the basic element in ones own mind stream. There is no flaw in three results arising from a single cause because this single cause accomplishes those three results through the power of the three conditions—by virtue of the condition of awakening, the Buddha is accomplished; by virtue of the qualities, the dharma is accomplished; and by virtue of enlightened activity, the samgha is accomplished. This is what the former masters say. Nevertheless, the three jewels that are the ultimate results are one and only labeled as three. Also, the meaning of attainment here refers only to what has been present pri­mordially in a self-arisen manner finally becoming manifest. (2) According to the cycle of nirvana, the three of awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity represent the results. Among them, awakening is ones own welfare, while the sambhogakàya and nirmànakàya promote the welfare of those to be guided who are close and distant, re­spectively. Thus, in terms of the two welfares, the results are definite as three. The basic element is the cause, and the three jewels are the conditions. For, by virtue of the Bud­dha, the dharma, and the samgha performing the activities of the teacher, the path, and the companions, the basic element awakens and thus is accomplished as the results that consist of awakening and so on. It may be objected that the basic element is not tenable as a cause because it is the expanse—emptiness. Though it is not tenable as a cause that produces something, it is suitable as a cause of becoming free because the three jewels are nothing but the stained basic element’s having become stainless. Nor is it the case that the three jewels and the three of awakening, the qualities, and enlightened activity are repetitious because there is the difference of their being either causes or results in the context of these two cycles. See also the presentation of these two cycles in a text by Sherab Jungné (Tib. Shes rab ’byung gnas; 1187-1241), the nephew and successor of Jigden Surngon (Roberts 2011, 398-400).1889.

See CMW (449-52).1928. This represents the traditional Indo-Tibetan hermeneutical etymology of the term bhagavan, literally meaning “fortunate,” “prosperous,” “happy,” “glorious,” “illustri­ous,” “divine,” “adorable,” “venerable,” or “holy.” Bhaga usually means good fortune, happiness, welfare, prosperity, dignity, majesty, distinction, excellence, beauty, or love, but Buddhist commentaries interpret the term as having the two meanings of (1) “de­stroying” and (2) “being fortunate or rich.” The meaning (3) “transcending” derives from a peculiar interpretation of the ending -ván. In detail, (1) the Bhagavan has de­stroyed or overcome the four rnaras—the mára of the skandhas, the mára of the afflic­tions, the mára of death, and the devaputramára (clinging to meditative experiences). (2) Among his six fortunes, richnesses, or qualities, (a) sovereignty or mastery refers to having overpowered all afflictive and cognitive obscurations and being the sole sover­eign or master of the awakened mind, (b) He is endowed with “the dharmas,” that is, the qualities of a buddha (such as the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique qualities). From among the five buddha wisdoms, this represents dharmadhátu wisdom, (c) “Fame” refers to the two rúpakáyas of a buddha since it is through these two (and not the invisible dharmakáya) that buddhas are known in the world. Among the five wisdoms, this quality corresponds to mirrorlike wisdom, (d) “Glory” refers to the wisdom of equality, (e) “Wisdom” specifically indicates discriminating wisdom, (f) “Effort” stands for all-accomplishing wisdom. (3) The syllable -ván in bhagavan here is interpreted as representing the -ván in “nirvána.” Thus, the Bhagaván has the quality of having attained the “nonabiding nirvána” of dwelling neither in samsára nor in the one-sided nirvána of arhats. Those three meanings of bhagaván—overcoming all ob­scurations, being endowed with the fortunes of all qualities, and going beyond samsára and nirvána—also make up the three syllables of the Tibetan translation (bcom Idan ’das) of this term. In brief, to overcome the two obscurations is the quality of relin­quishment. To be endowed with the wisdom dharmakáya is the quality of realization. The quality of transcendence means to be beyond samsára and nirvána and yet be able to appear anywhere in them without being affected by them.1929.

Though the Sanskrit kuta can mean both “peak” and “flock” (or “heap”), it is usually explained to mean the latter (which corresponds to the Tibetan phung po instead of rtse mo or the like). According to the ¿atasahasrikavivarana (D3802, fols. 3b.7-4a.l), Prasastrasenas commentary on the Heart Sutra (P5220, 292.3.7-8), and other sources, the mountain received its name from the shape of its rock formations that resemble a flock of vultures huddling together. Jnanamitra’s commentary on the Heart Sutra (P5217, 285.5.1-2) says that the name comes from flocks of vultures gathering on its top. Ngag dbang bstan dar lha ram pa’s (1759-1831) commentary on the Heart Sutra (trans. in Lopez 1988, 141) lists five ways of explaining this name by referring to Sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho’s (1653-1705) Bai durya g.ya sel: (1) the mountain’s being shaped like a vulture; (2) being shaped like a flock of vultures; (3) vultures protecting the mountain on which many such birds feed on corpses; (4) being a heap or flock due to the brilliance of the birds that are beings who understand emptiness; and (5) the Buddha’s robe’s being snatched by a demon in the form of a vulture and dropped on the mountain (which is shaped like a vulture’s head), where it turned to stone in four layers, which are known as “the great vulture heap.”1939. In accordance with the Dharanisvararajasutra, CMW spyodyul rnam par ’phrul pa zhes is emended to yul rnam par 'phrul pa.1940. Dharanisvararajasutra, D147, fol. 143b.2.1941. That is, in the space between the highest class of gods in the desire realm and the lowest class of gods in the form realm. This and the next paragraph are paraphrases of Dharanisvararajasutra, D147, fols. 143b.2-144b.7.1942. A yojana is an ancient Indian measure of distance, corresponding to about eight miles (according to other calculations, about four or sixteen miles).1943.

Both indranila and mahanila (mthon kha chen po) mean “sapphire.”1944. CMW ri las emended to ri la.1945. Nagas are mythical beings with human faces and serpent-like bodies, who live in the oceans and other bodies of water. They are said to be fond of hoarding great riches and are also considered to have been the caretakers of the prajnaparamita sutras until Nagarjuna retrieved these scriptures from them. Yaksas are a class of normally benevolent and helpful but somewhat fickle spirits who live on the earth (often in forests), in the air, and in the lower divine realms. Exceptions to their benevolence are that they may cause epidemics or possess humans, and some of them even eat human flesh. Gandharvas are the celestial musicians of Indra, who sustain themselves only through smells and live in the air and the heavenly waters. Asuras are the opponents of the gods with whom they constantly wage war because they envy the superior fortunes of the gods. Garudas are mythical birds with eagle wings and lion heads that are the natural enemies of the nagas (the garuda is also the mount of Visnu). Kimnaras are beings with a human body and the head of a horse or with a horse’s body and a human head. They live at the court of Kubera (the god of wealth) and, like the gandharvas, are celestial musicians. Uragas or mahoragas are large-bellied serpent demons living on the earth and below. “Nonhumans” often refers to ghosts and malignant spirits.1946.

RGVVs reasoning says, “The buddha element (subject) is explained through a description of the sixty kinds of factors that purify its [natural] purity (probandum) because it is [only] if the object to be purified is endowed with qualities that purifications of its purity are justified (reason).” CMW’s reasoning goes, “As for the buddha element, it is explained that this naturally pure [buddha element] exists in all sentient beings because the sixty conditions for purifying the basic element are taught in the main part of the sutra following the introduction.” Thus, RGVV and CMW share the same subject, but differ in probandum and reason (in fact, CMW’s reason is a paraphrase of the long qualifier “a description of the sixty kinds of factors that purify its [natural] purity” in RGVV’s probandum). In effect, both reasonings are complementary in establishing through the scriptural passage about the sixty factors that purify the buddha element that this buddha element exists in all sentient beings because any purification of this buddha element (the object to be purified) is only tenable if that element is already en­dowed with intrinsic qualities that clearly manifest as the result of purification once the"},{"pageNumber":1159,"pageContent":"Notes 1143purification process is finished. In that vein, R G W ’s reasoning can be understood as an answer to someone challenging the validity of the subject property (the reason’s indeed applying to the subject) in CMWs reasoning. For the details of the subject property, the positive concomitance, and the negative concomitance of CMW’s reasonings being established, see right below in the text.2000. CMW yongs su dag shes par bya ba’i don zhes pa sbyar bar bya’i gzhi emended to yongs su dag par bya ba’i don zhes pa sbyang bar bya ba’i gzhi.2001. CMW yod na zhes emended to yod ces.2002.

This refers to RG W s Prakrit verse about gold’s being covered by stony debris (J6). As already mentioned, the Lahkavatarasutra is not in Prakrit and contains only a partly similar verse (X.751), while the Ghanavyuhasutra (D110, fol. 7b.l-3) contains a verse that corresponds closely to the first three lines of the verse in question.2007.

CMW omits this entry.2013. CMW bzhugspa emended to zhugspa.2014. CMW dkon mchog dang bral ba dkon mchog gi rigs mi gcod par de dag mchodpa la sbyor ba is corrupt and is emended according to the Dharanisvararajasutra.2015. The following (partly abbreviated) explanations of the sixteen compassions of great awakening are found in the Dharanisvararajasutra (D147, fols. 175b.l-182a.3). Here, awakening is without root and basis. “Root” refers to “the views about a real personal­ity” and “basis” to “false imagination.”2016. Awakening is peaceful and quiescent. “Peace” refers to the internal (the six sense fac­ulties being empty of a self and what is mine) and “quiescence” to the external (through understanding that the sense faculties are empty, one does not chase after their objects).2017. Since the mind is naturally luminous, awakening is naturally luminous. However, since ordinary beings do not realize this natural luminosity, they are afflicted by adven­titious afflictions.2018. This refers to awakenings not seizing or rejecting any phenomena and thus realizing that all phenomena and suchness are without “beyond” and “not beyond.”2019. Awakening is without characteristics and focal objects. “Without characteristics” re­fers to the six consciousnesses being unobservable and “without focal objects” to not seeing their objects. What is without characteristics and focal objects is the sphere of the noble ones, that is, what is not contained in the three realms of samsara."},{"pageNumber":1160,"pageContent":"1144 Notes2020. Awakening is neither what is past, nor what is in the future, nor what occurs in the present. This is the equality of the three times, in which the three spheres are extinct. The three spheres refer to minds engaging in what is past, consciousness's coursing in what is in the future, and mental engagements engaging in what occurs at pres­ent. Since mind, mentation, and consciousness do not abide in awakening, there is no thinking about what is past, no reflecting about what is in the future, and no entertain­ing of reference points about the present.2021. CMW mistakenly counts these as two separate entries. Awakening is without body and unconditioned. “Without body” refers to what cannot be cognized by the six con­sciousnesses and “being unconditioned” to what lacks arising, abiding, and ceasing.2022. Awakening is without foundation and inseparable. “Foundation” refers to suchness, the dharmadhatu, the true end, emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, no sentient be­ings, space, being without arising, being unconditioned, awakening, and nirvana. “In­separable” refers to being without foundation, not different, immovable, unobservable, nonconceptual, there being no aspiration prayers to be made, no essence of sentient beings, being nonreferential, without ceasing, without movement, quiescent, and there being nothing to be accomplished.2023. One will not become completely awakened through body or mind because the body is matter and the mind is like an illusion. Awakening cannot be expressed through any phenomenon, be it the body, the mind, the dharma, what is not the dharma, what is real, what is unreal, what is true, or what is false. Just like space, it is shapeless and inexpressible. All phenomena are inexpressible—words do not exist in phenomena and phenomena do not exist in words.2024. Awakening is ungraspable and without basis. “Ungraspable” refers to understand­ing the six sense faculties. “Without basis” refers to the six objects’ being unobserv­able. Through consciousness’s being without foundation, buddhas understand the four foundations of the minds of all sentient beings—forms, feelings, discriminations, and formations—to be without foundation.2025. Awakening is a synonym of emptiness, and all phenomena are empty too. It is not that emptiness is realized through emptiness, but emptiness and awakening are not two. All phenomena are nondual, without characteristics, without arising, and so on. “Empty” is a synonym for the lack of clinging and grasping. Though no phenomena are observable ultimately, they are still called “empty.” Just as space is called “space” despite not being something that can be expressed, empty is called “empty” despite not being something that can be expressed. The fact that what has no name is labeled by names applies conventionally to all phenomena, but neither names nor the phenomena labeled by them abide in any location or direction. The tathagatas realize all phenomena to be without arising, ceasing, characteristics, mind, mentation, consciousness, letters, and terms. Just as they realize that, they are liberated—there is no bondage and no release.2026. Just as space, awakening is neither equal nor not equal. All phenomena are not really established and thus cannot be expressed as being equal or not equal. This is realized by perfect wisdom. All phenomena are without root, without arising, without ceasing, and originate from the unoriginated. They originate without any owner and separate with­out any owner. Though they operate in dependence on such originating and perishing, there is no operation whatsoever here. It is in order to cut through the path (of such seeming arising and ceasing) that the tathagatas teach the dharma.2027. Awakening is the ground of how things are. The skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas are like awakening—they do not go beyond suchness and the tathagatas realize them just as they are. They are the same before, the same later, and the same in between. They do"},{"pageNumber":1161,"pageContent":"Notes 1145not arise in the beginning, do not vanish in the end, and are devoid in between. Thus, they are all the ground of how things are.2028. The two instances of gnaspa in this phrase in CMW are emended to mam pa. Awak­ening is to engage what is without aspects through engaging aspects. “Aspects” refers to making efforts in all virtuous phenomena, reflecting on, assessing, counting, and dis­criminating phenomena, and discriminating what is conditioned. “What is without as­pects” refers to the ground that is the mind without ground, the door to liberation that is the samadhi of signlessness, what is utterly beyond assessment (that in which there is no activity of consciousness), and the direct perception of what is unconditioned.2029. Awakening is uncontaminated and without appropriation. “Uncontaminated” refers to being free from the four contaminations—desire, becoming, ignorance, and views. “Without appropriation” refers to being free from the four appropriations—desire, views, propounding a self, and holding discipline and spiritual discipline as paramount. These appropriations are all appropriations by virtue of being darkened by ignorance, approached through craving, and appropriated through clinging by thinking “me.” Since the Buddha knows the root of appropriating a self, he realizes that sentient beings are pure because the self is pure. The self’s purity and the purity of sentient beings do not exist as two and cannot be divided into two. The meaning of not existing as two is being without arising. Since there is neither arising nor ceasing, mind, mentation, and consciousness do not operate. Where mind, mentation, and consciousness do not oper­ate, there is no false imagination that becomes improper mental engagement. Through being endowed with proper mental engagement here, there is nothing triggered by ig­norance, thus nothing triggered by the twelve links of samsaric existence, and thus nothing that arises. What does not arise is certain, is of definitive meaning, and thus the ultimate, the lack of a person, the inexpressible actuality, dependent origination, the actuality of the dharma, suchness, and the Tathagata. Thus, it is said, “Whoever sees dependent origination, sees the dharma. Whoever sees the dharma, sees the Tathagata.” This is seeing in the sense of not seeing anything whatsoever, that is, at the time of see­ing without any characteristics, focal objects, and mind, true reality is seen.2030. Awakening is pure, stainless, and without afflictions. “Pure” refers to emptiness, lack of arising, nature, lack of reference points, suchness, and so on. “Stainlessness” refers to signlessness, nonformation, purity, nonreferentiality, dharmadhatu, and so on. “With­out afflictions” refers to wishlessness, nonorigination, luminosity, peace of reference points, the true end, and so on. Awakening and all other phenomena are just like space. Therefore, it is said that all phenomena are equal to nirvana—since they have reached their end, there are no remedies. Since there are no remedies, all phenomena are pri- mordially pure, stainless, and without afflictions. It is interesting to note that most of these explanations in the Dhdranisvarardjasutra on the sixteen kinds of compassion of great awakening greatly resemble the prajnaparamita sutras in both style and contents, sometimes even being literally the same.2031. Dhdranisvarardjasutra, D147, fols. 175b.l-185a.6.2032. Here, CMW mistakenly repeats the entire above section on the sixteen kinds of com­passion of great awakening.2033.

Here and in the next instance of this term, CMW has 0 ta ya.2052. This is what appears in the Sanskrit of Uttaratantra 1.7b and thus seems to be what CMW pa ra pra ti ya na 0 ta ya (which makes no sense) refers to.2053. CMW ’bi tsa o taya.2054. These six phrases are found in RG W s third quotation from the Sarvabuddhavišayá- vatárajňá naloká la m ká rasu tra (J9-10).2055. CMW has nges pa dang ma nges pa, but ma nges pa is repeated in the next sentence.2056. CMW gnas ma ’os pa emended to gnas ma bu pa.2057. CMW sen ’da’ ba. This is a Tibetan term used for the Theravádins (particularly those from Šri Laňka), traditionally the fiercest opponents of the maháyána, who usually deny that it was ever taught by the Buddha but rather concocted by later persons or even by demons. The term seems to be a corrupt form of “Sin(g)hala” (meaning “of or related to Srí Laňka”). According to Chandra Dass Tibetan-English dictionary (1276), sendhapa is probably a Tibetanized form of siddha (which is very unlikely). Das further mistakenly equates siddha with Tib. bsod snyoms pa (“alms-goer”). The Sanskrit for bsod snyoms pa is pindapátika or paindilika, but it is rather unlikely that sendhapa is a corrupted form of these terms.2058. This refers to RG W s comments on 1.32-33 (J27-29). CMW strictly follows RGVV’s presentation but explicitly specifies the three kinds of persons that are described in more general ways by RGW . Thus, the two kinds of persons that make up (1) those with great desire who crave for samsáric existence are identified as the Lokáyatas and the Sendhapas who have fallen into the hlnayana. Among the three types of persons under (2a) those who crave to be free from samsáric existence and have not entered the means for liberation, the second type (Buddhists who still entertain views about the person and lack faith in the ultimate) is identified as the Vátsíputriyas.2059. XIV.43. Sthiramatis Sútrálamkáravrttibhásya (D4034, vol. mi, fol. 279b.4-7) ex­plains that the nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise, by virtue of realizing everything as having the nature of space, purifies the buddha attributes (such as the"},{"pageNumber":1163,"pageContent":"Notes 1147powers and fearlessnesses) in one’s own mind stream. Therefore, it is what matures oneself. The pure mundane wisdom that is attained subsequent to the supramundane nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise is what establishes the individual char­acteristics, qualities, and so on, of each one of the ten bhumis in a distinct manner. It matures sentient beings through teaching them the dharma, displaying awakening, and so on.2060. In accordance with the same passage that is repeated below, CMW gyis is emended to du.2061. CMW lam gyis ’bras bu bsdus emended to lam gyi *bras bus bsdus.2062. CMW chos emended to rnam.2063. Uttaratantra 1.87/89.2064. CMW bar chad byed emended to bar chad med.2065. This presentation is based on the first three of “the four remedies.” The first two represent the process of preparing for and actually eradicating the factors to be relin­quished, with (1) “the invalidating remedy” referring to the preparatory phase, that is, focusing on the four realities of the noble ones and invalidating the obscurations in terms of their sixteen aspects (for example, the supreme dharma of the path of preparation). (2) “The relinquishing remedy” refers to the uninterrupted path, that is, actually eradicating even the seeds of the respective factors to be relinquished (for ex­ample, the first moment of the path of seeing—“the dharma readiness of suffering”). The remaining two remedies describe what happens once the factors to be relinquished have been eradicated. (3) “The sustaining remedy” is the path of liberation, that is, experiencing and sustaining the attained freedom from the factors that have been relin­quished through the preceding uninterrupted path (for example, the second moment of the path of seeing—“the dharma cognition of suffering”). (4) “The distancing rem­edy” represents “the special path,” that is, various samadhis that enhance ones real­izations attained through the preceding path of liberation (such as “the Lion’s Sport Samadhi”) or that are needed as aids for benefiting sentient beings (such as “the Sky Treasure Samadhi”).2066. CMW has byams pa twice.2067. As before with verses 1.5-8, in commenting on 1.9, CMW already matches the el­ements of this verse with the qualities explained in 1.10-12. Verses 1.10-12 are only briefly referred to in the text below as representing the detailed and distinct explana­tions of 1.9, but all comments on them are included in this “brief introduction” here.2068. YDC (253) elaborates that the reality of cessation is not nonexistent because it exists as having the character of the perfect nature (yongs su grub pai bdag nyid du yod pa), that is, as the sphere that is to be personally experienced by the noble ones. Nor can it be scrutinized one-sidedly as being existent because it does not exist as any phenomenon that is a reference point, that is, it is beyond everything that is seeming. This corre­sponds to “neither existent nor nonexistent” in Mahdydnasutralamkdra IV.la and “the basic element is empty of what is adventitious but not empty of unsurpassable quali­ties” in Uttaratantra 1.155/158. Consequendy, the reality of cessation is also not both existent and nonexistent because existence and nonexistence are mutually exclusive. Nor can it be scrutinized as being anything other than existent or nonexistent because it is not an object of those who cling to extremes.2069. RGVV (P) 'phags lam mkhyen.2070.

This accords with Dharmaklrti’s Pramanavdrttika II.206c: “Consciousness is the phe­nomenon that apprehends objects.”2073. This is the typical Yogacara explanation of matching the meanings of “mind” (citta), “mentation” (mams), and “consciousness” (vijhana) with the eight kinds of consciousness.2074. CMW spong emended to yong.2075. This refers to the path resembling the sun in its three characteristics of being pure, luminous, and a remedial factor.2076. CMW bzhi emended to gzhi.2077. This seems to say that if the irreversible samgha consisted only of bodhisattvas on the eighth bhumi and above, the defining characteristics of irreversibility—the wis­doms of knowing suchness and variety—would mistakenly not cover many of the in­stances to which they actually apply, that is, all bodhisattvas on the first seven bhumis.2078. As before, CMW provides no separate comments on 1.14 but includes parts of that verse in its comments on 1.13.2079. As already mentioned, this corresponds to the explanation in Abhisamaydlamkdra IV.39-59 and its commentaries.2080. RYC (40) says that the seeing of suchness and variety of bodhisattvas arises on the first bhumi because they realize on this bhumi that the dharmadhatu is omnipresent.2081. In English, this is the second line of 1.13, while CMW refers to the different order of the lines in the Tibetan version.2082. CMW zhespas emended to zhes nas.2083. Skt. gati means “going,” “movement,” “state,” “mode of existence,” “the course of be­ings through numerous forms of life,” and “the condition of a person undergoing this migration.” Likewise, the corresponding Tibetan word gro ba literally means “going” but is also used with the meanings “state of existence” or “being.”2084.

Referring back to “inner wisdom vision” in I.14ab, YDC (258) adds that the two wisdoms of suchness and variety that realize minds true nature—identitylessness—and that pervade all sentient beings are also self-awareness because they are the vision of personally experienced wisdom without depending on anything else.2088.

As it stands, this paragraph about the mahàyàna samgha on the bhümis is quite con­fusing. For it was already said that the four reasons in 1.20 for not being an ultimate refuge—summarized in the three reasons of not being free from fear, not being able to liberate others from fear, and not having an utterly stable essence—do not apply to the mahàyàna dharma and samgha. In the preceding paragraph, the actual dharma was identified as the reality of cessation, for which it seems tenable to say that none of these reasons apply. However, the two sentences here about bodhisattvas on the first seven bhümis lacking the ability to liberate others from fear and bodhisattvas on the last three bhümis lacking permanence mean that the last two among the above three reasons do apply to these bodhisattvas. Thus, only the first reason of “being fearful” does not apply to bodhisattvas on the bhümis (maybe this is regarded as sufficient here for them being a genuine object of refuge).2102.

Rngog lo tsà ba bio Idan shes rab 1993b, fols. 27b.6-28a.4.2106. GC (241.6-14) comments on I.24cd-25 that the main subject of the Uttaratantra is the awakening (byang chub) of a buddha (sangs rgyas). Since the first two reasons in 1.25 teach the progression of the stains becoming pure, they teach the two aspects of being cleansed (byang) and being purified (sangs). Since the latter two reasons teach the qualities and their functions, they teach the two aspects of final realization (chub) and unfolding (rgyas). In terms of the ground, the first two reasons mainly teach the basic elements aspect of being free from reference points because they teach that due to suffering and its origin being adventitious, they are primordially empty (and the basic element is empty of them). The latter two reasons mainly teach the aspect that the basic element abides as the phenomenon of basic awareness because they teach its qualities and activity. This is also the case because it is due to the basic elements aspect of being free from reference points that it represents the nirvanas of the three yànas by virtue of this aspects being realized partially or in its entirety. It is due to the aspect of the basic elements being awareness that it represents the phenomena of samsara because the entirety of samsara arises from the alaya-consciousness that represents a mere reflection of this phenomenon of awareness appearing. The Third Karmapa s au­tocommentary on his Profound Inner Reality (Rang byung rdo rje n.d., 21) explains the four inconceivable points as follows: “The [inconceivable] point of the ‘basic element’ is that the buddha heart is [primordially] not tainted by any stains, but does not become buddhahood until all afflictive and cognitive stains have been relinquished. The [incon­ceivable] point of awakening is that [the basic element] is associated with these stains since beginningless time, but because these stains are adventitious, they are not estab­lished as any real substance. The [inconceivable] point of the qualities [of awakening] is that the sixty-four qualities of buddhahood exist in all sentient beings right now in a complete way, but if they are not triggered through the condition of the immaculate dharmas (the natural outflow of the utterly stainless dharmadhatu), their power does not come forth. [The inconceivable point of enlightened activity is that] there is no"},{"pageNumber":1166,"pageContent":"1150 Notesdifference in enlightened activity’s [effortless, spontaneous, and nonconceptual] oper­ation in terms of all sentient beings and buddhas being either the same or different. Thus, its inconceivability is its being free from all expressions, yet serving as the basis for all expressions.” For more details, see Brunnholzl 2009, 129-31.2107. CMW kyi emended to kyis.2108. For YDC’s general presentation of the basic element, see appendix 4.2109. CMW lacks any comments on 1.27, thus obviously referring to a version of the Ut­taratantra /RGW that did not include this verse. Nevertheless, I retain the numbering of the following verses for the sake of concordance.2110. This refers to verses 1.144/147-152/155 matching the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition with the nine examples.2111. Uttaratantra 1.145/148.2112. Compare CMW’s (480-81) comments in the text below on a passage from the Jhandlokalamkarasutra, which say that even those with great desire (equivalent to “those without the disposition”) thrive through virtuous dharmas because they have the naturally pure disposition. If they did not have the naturally pure disposition, they would not thrive through the light rays of the wisdom of the tathagatas. But at the time of being struck by the light rays of this wisdom, their time of being endowed with the four wheels (such as relying on wise persons) has come.2113. IX.15.2114. IX.37.2115.1.150/153. In line d, CMW gnyis pai sa ni is emended to gnyis payis ni.2116. Respectively, the three points of power, being unchanging, and being moist in Ut­taratantra 1.31 refer back to the three aspects of the tathagata heart that were taught in 1.27-28—the dharmakaya’s radiating, the suchness of sentient beings and buddhas being undifferentiated, and the disposition s existing in all being.2117. Note that CMW does not refer to Uttaratantra 1.27.2118. CMW already includes parts of 1.30-31 in its comments on the nature here, while no separate explanation of these two verses is offered in the text below.2119. CMW already includes most of the elements of 1.32-34 in its comments on the cause here. Some additional explanation of verses 1.32-33 is offered in the text below, but it refers only to a few of their elements.2120. CMW gang dag emended to gang zag.2121.

YDC (279-80) says that, if the nature of the naturally pure basic element is divided by way of isolates, it is threefold—the dharmakaya (which primarily represents wis­dom), suchness (which primarily represents the expanse), and the disposition (which primarily represents means and prajna). In addition, YDC quotes Madhyantavibhaga I.16cd on the examples of water, gold, and space for emptiness’s always being natu­rally pure but only being afflicted by adventitious stains. It also cites Dharmadhatustava 9-10 and 23 on the dharmadhatu free of stain not radiating while obscured by the afflictions, just as a beryl inside its ore, and wisdom within the afflictions remaining stainless, just as water within the earth.2135. In Tibetan, this verse has only three lines.2136. Obviously, these two sentences in RGVV still refer to the persons who possess the obscurations. The actual beginning of RGVV’s explanation of the obscurations is its following sentence, “What are these four [obscurations]?”2137. RYC (64) says that it is not definite that these four obscurations in that order exist exclusively in the corresponding kinds of persons but they are presented as the kinds of obscurations that exist predominantly in these four types of persons.2138. To make sense in the context of what CMW says here, ’di Itar should be ’dir.2139. CMWs remark on the position of the sentence, “These are the four kinds of obscu­rations . . . ” seems to be based on using a Sanskrit manuscript of RGVV in which this sentence appears right after the sentence that ends in “not perceiving the tathagata ele­ment” rather than further below (as it does in the present Sanskrit version of RGVV). Thus, according to CMWs Sanskrit version, the passage in question in RGVV should read, “Now, apart from those sentient beings who are firmly grounded in the mahayana ... and not perceiving the tathagata element. These are the four kinds of obscurations of the four kinds of sentient beings. ‘What are these four?’ . ..” As a consequence of the different position of the sentence “These are the four kinds of obscurations . . .,” CMW obviously takes RGVV’s question “What are these four?” as referring to the four remedies and not to the four obscurations. However, even if the sentence in question is shifted as in CMW’s version, the resultant passage “Now, apart from those sentient beings who are firmly grounded in the mahayana... These are the four kinds of obscu­rations of the four kinds of sentient beings” only speaks about the persons who possess the four obscurations. Though that passage simply mentions “the four obscurations,” it does not name or describe them, which is only done in the passage that follows the question, “What are these four?” Moreover, no matter whether the sentence in question is shifted or not, the context and syntax of the Sanskrit clearly indicate that the passage that follows the question “What are these four?” primarily describes the four obscura­tions, with each one’s being followed by its remedy. CMW’s suggested rearrangement of Ngog’s translation of the four sentences that speak about the four obscurations and their remedies precisely follows the syntactical order of the Sanskrit (thus support­ing rather than contradicting its primarily being a description of the obscurations), whereas each of Ngog’s four sentences start with the phrases about the corresponding remedies (this is obviously a translation issue that is exclusively rooted in the Tibetan since both Ngog’s and CMW’s Tibetan version can be rendered into English in another"},{"pageNumber":1168,"pageContent":"1152 Notesorder than the one of the Sanskrit). Still, apart from Ngog’s translation thus not follow­ing the exact order of the Sanskrit (though it cannot be ruled out entirely that he had a different Sanskrit version of these sentences) and being more unwieldy in Tibetan, the meaning does not change at all. In brief, either way it is clear that RG W speaks here about the obscurations together with their remedies, especially since this is the texts only description of these four obscurations.2140. CMW pu ra te ka makes no sense, thus it is tentatively emended to pratika (meaning “the first part or word of a verse” or “a line of verse”) since CMW seems to refer here to the reverse order of the phrases in each of the first three lines of the Sanskrit and Tibetan of this verse (for example, the first line in Sanskrit starts with “those whose seed,” followed by “is the faith in the supreme yana,” while the Tibetan reverses the order of these two phrases).2141. CMW sang ba emended to tsang ba.2142. YDC (283) says that the instructions on the four causes, such as faith in the mahayana, and their four results (the four paramitas) also implicitly teach these two sets of four as being the causes and results of awakening the basic element.2143. CMW mdo’i emended to mdos.2144. CMW zhe na emended to zhes pa. This is an abbreviated paraphrase of RG W s (J34) brief quote from the ¿nmaladevisutra (fol. 273b.7).2145. Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche (oral communication, July 25, 2013) explains the four paramitas and their close connection to the presentation of ultimate reality in the vaj- rayana as follows. (1) As for the paramita of supreme purity, ultimately, the tathagata heart is primordially unobscured by, and primordially liberated from, any adventitious stains. This represents its “natural purity.” On the level of seeming reality, the tathagata heart appears to be obscured by the adventitious stains together with their latent ten­dencies. Once all of these have been relinquished through the path, the tathagata heart also possesses “the purity of having been freed from adventitious stains.” This twofold purity of the tathagata heart represents the paramita of supreme purity. This descrip­tion is very close to the vajrayanas speaking of “the inseparability of the two realities that is the great purity and equality” (Tib. dag mnyam chen po bden gnyis dbyer med), “apparitional existences being primordial buddhahood” (Tib. snang srid ye nas sangs rgyas) and “the kaya of complete purity” (suvisuddhikaya). (2) As for the paramita of the supreme self, ordinary beings assume the existence of a self and cling to it, while sravakas and pratyekabuddhas hold on to the view of there being no self. Just as ordi­nary beings are afraid of the nonexistence of a self, so sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are afraid of the existence of a self. However, in the paramita of the supreme self, both of these views and attitudes are completely transcended. For, ultimately, any reference points about a self as well as any reference points about the lack of a self are equally nothing but wrong views. The basic nature that is beyond all reference points of self and no-self represents the primordially present buddha wisdom that pervades and dwells in everything. This is the paramita of the supreme self, which is also called “wisdom dharmakaya” (jnanadharmakaya; as explained in the Abhisamaydlamkdra). In the vaj- rayana, this corresponds to the teachings on “vajra pride” and so on. (3) The paramita of supreme bliss means that the tathagata heart is completely free from all elements of clinging. Also, on the level of seeming reality, all kinds of manifestations of the reality of suffering and the reality of the origin of suffering are experienced. That is, there are many phenomena that move and change, and whatever has the nature of moving and changing has the nature of suffering. Ultimately, the basic nature is without any move­ment and change, and to abide in that basic nature entails the experience of bliss. In"},{"pageNumber":1169,"pageContent":"Notes 1153the vajrayana, this is expressed as “the wisdom of great bliss” and “immutable wisdom” (Tib. ’pho med ye shes). In other words, if there is no movement or transference (Tib.1pho ba), there is bliss, which is also called “the kaya of great bliss” (mahasukhakdya). (4) The paramita of supreme permanence refers to buddha wisdom s never changing into anything other than this very wisdom. In the fruitional buddha wisdom, there is no clinging to samsara and nirvana being different. Rather, the complete equality of samsara and nirvana is realized as the great unconditioned state, which is free from any extremes of clinging to entities or nonentities. In the vajrayana, this corresponds to “the vajrakaya,” which cannot be changed through anything whatsoever, just like a vajra or a diamond. A diamond cuts all other gems, but it cannot be cut by anything. Likewise, the nature of the mind cannot be altered by anything, and it is solely from this perspective that it is called “permanent.” It is not referred to as permanent because there is some permanent entity called “the nature of the mind” or “tathagata heart.” Thus, the notion of permanence here is not like the one in elementary texts such as The Collected Topics (Tib. Bsdus grva) or in the Vaibhasika and Sautrantika schools. Rather, according to Sakya Pandita, even Dharmaklrti in his teachings on valid cognition used “permanent” only in the sense of being the reverse of “impermanent” but not in the sense of a permanently existent entity. In other words, when the equality of samsara and nirvana is realized, there is no clinging to any extremes such as permanence and impermanence. This is what is understood by the paramita of supreme permanence.2146. In accordance with the context and the parallel phrase in the next paragraph, CMW rjes su byed par Idogpa’i sgo nas is emended to rjes su byed par rjes su ’gro Idoggi sgo nas. The positive concomitance here reads, “If the buddha element exists, there is weariness of suffering and the wish for nirvana.” The negative concomitance says, “If the buddha element did not exist, there would be neither weariness of suffering nor the wish for nirvana.”2147. RYC (75) explains that through 1.40-41 explicitly teaching the function of the un­folding disposition, one implicitly understands the function of the naturally abiding disposition too. For, without the support (the naturally abiding disposition), the sup­ported (the unfolding disposition) does not arise.2148. In accordance with the parallel phrase in the immediately preceding sentence, CMW ’dod pa is emended to *byung ba.2149. Here, there is a note in CMW saying that the original copy is spoiled and that text is supplied by taking Asangas autocommentary as the basis because there is no way to be able to see what the original copy says (though there is no explicit indication up to where the text is illegible, given the nature of the supplied text, this probably refers only to parts or all of the quote from RGVV but not the text of CMW itself).2150. CMW sdig to sel ba’i tshul emended to sdigpa mi zadpa’i tshul.2151. CMW mistakenly has der ’gyur na twice.2152. CMW rang emended to yang.2153. Given the context and the question by someone in the next paragraph, the original subject of the above concomitances and the consequence is “those with great desire” (which is taken as an equivalent of “those without the disposition”).2154. Throughout this section, CMW replaces “those with great desire” with “those with wrong craving,” which follows the reading of RGW (DP).2155. CMW rten emended to gtan.2156. CMW la ’ong ba emended to ma ’ong ba.2157. CMW rten emended to gtan.2158. CMW tshad ma dgod emended to tshad ma ma dgod."},{"pageNumber":1170,"pageContent":"1154 Notes2159. YDC (287) agrees that the statement in the Mahdparinirvdnasutra is a statement with an intention behind it. Its purpose is that it was made for the sake of turning those with great desire away from their hostility toward the mahayana dharma since that is the cause for their having great desire. Its basis of intention is that the Buddha had another time in mind. The rest of R G W ’s passage (“Since the naturally pure disposition exists . ..”) represents the invalidation of the explicit statement.2160. RGVV (P) yis ’di, RGVV (D) and Ut (D) yis ni2161. In due order, the topics of endowment, manifestation, phases, and all-pervasiveness correspond to verses 1.42-44,45-46,47-48, and 49-50.2162. As mentioned before, after the introductory verse 1.51, the fourteen verses in ques­tion are 1.52-63 on the changelessness of the basic element in the phase of its being impure (followed by explanatory verses 1.64-65), 1.66 on its phase of being both impure and pure (followed by explanatory verses 1.67-78), and 1.79 on its phase of being com­pletely pure (followed by explanatory verses 1.80-83).2163. This refers to RGVV’s commenting on 1.51.2164. CMW kyis emended to kyi.2165. RYC (92) says that the phase of bodhisattvas is called “impure and pure” because this phase entails engaging in minds and mental factors that are a blend of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena.2166.1 follow RGVV (P) tshogs against RGVV (D) and Ut (DP) sogs.2167. CMW tshul bzhin emended to tshul bzhin mayin pai.2168. CMW me emended to sa.2169. CMW follows RGVV (DP) “great seers” (drang srong chen po).2170. CMW bshad emended to med.2171. CMW follows RGVV (DP) “man” (mi).2172. D45.47, fols. 241b.7-242a.5.2173. CMW mig Ita bu bu gcigpu emended to mig Ita bu gcigpu.2174. For more details on this topic of bodhisattvas deliberately retaining a certain degree of affliction in order to take rebirth in samsara for the benefit of all beings, while not being affected by these afflictions or samsara, see Brunnholzl (2010, 549-59, 589-90, and 596) and Brunnholzl (2011b, 135-36).2175. This refers to Uttaratantra 1.77-78.2176. Mahdydnasutralamkara IX.82-85.2177. The Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkdra (Brunnholzl 2010, 520) provides yet another explanation for the enlightened activity of buddhas and bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi being said to be equal: “In terms of the enlightened activity that exists for its recipients (its objects), there is no difference between someone on the tenth bhumi and a buddha, but there is a difference in terms of the enlightened activity that exists for the agents [of this activity]. By virtue of this explanation that there is no difference in terms of the enlightened activity for the recipients (the objects), one should not think that there is no difference between buddhas and bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi in terms of the extent of the power of their qualities, such as promot­ing the welfare of sentient beings. Rather, it is explained that their difference is like the one between the [amounts of] water in the ocean and in the hoof print of an ox. Nev­ertheless, the intention behind the explanation that there is no difference between their enlightened activities in terms of the recipients (the objects) is to realize that, from the perspective of the objects of enlightened activity (that is, worldly beings), there is no difference between the enlightened activities of buddhas and bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi. It is in this sense that [Uttaratantra I.77b] says, ‘for the worlds, bodhisattvas are"},{"pageNumber":1171,"pageContent":"Notes 1155equal/ The outcome of this statement is that merely appearing as equal in the world does not fulfill the function of actually being equal.”2178. Technically speaking, the thesis here is “the dharmakáya is permanent.” This is also what the Tibetan word datn bca usually indicates, but here it is obviously used for just the predicate of the reasoning.2179. CMW nyon mongs pas emended to nyon mongs pa.2180. CMW bshad pa de’i emended to bshad pa des.2181. CMW *bad pa nyid emended to bdag nyid.2182.

The Tibetan of 1.8lad has “it” (de ni) whereas that pronoun is missing in 1.82 (by con­trast, in the English syntax, the subject “it” has to appear in every sentence in 1.82-83.)2184. CMW has an isolated rtag par after this paragraph, which is linked with “the dhar- makáya” here in analogy with what the parallel sentences in the preceding and the next paragraphs say.2185. CMW brtan pa emended to rtag pa.2186. CMW dang emended to yang.2187. These two verses, which basically reiterate and match 1.79 and 80ab, are not con­tained in the presently available Sanskrit version of the Uttaratantra in R G W but are found in Ut (DP) and RG W (DP).2188. Apart from this being a general reference to the tathdgatagarbha siitras, CMW could also be read as specifically referring to the Tathagatagarbhasutra, but I could not locate any passage in this sutra that uses the words of the verses in question.2189. While the Sanskrit dryasatyam paramarthanirvrtih of 1.84b is very clear as “the real­ity of the noble ones and the ultimate nirvana,” the Tibetan ’phagspa’i bden pa don dam mya ngan ’das is ambiguous. Therefore, some Tibetan commentaries (such as CMW and RYC) connect “the ultimate” to “the reality of the noble ones,” while others con­nect it to “nirvana.”2190. In accordance with 1.86c, CMW de las ma rtogs is emended to the more likely de las ma gtogs.

When they are complete, the body of the nirvana that possesses the four qualities as in 1.90 is accomplished. Thus, the six páramitás are the causes of this nonabiding nirvana, which is the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects. According to YDC, the Third Karmapa says that the meaning of the empti­ness endowed with all supreme aspects should be understood from establishing utterly changeless wisdom in the Kálacakratantra."},{"pageNumber":1172,"pageContent":"1156 Notes2200. Compare the comments in the Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisa- maydlamkdra (Brunnholzl 2011b, 175-79) on the four qualities in Uttaratantra 1.90: “‘All aspects’ of the knowledge of all aspects [a term for a buddha’s omniscience] do not exist as conventional numbers. Or they are ‘innumerable’ because the aspects of the ultimate knowledge of all aspects are limitless. Since the knowledge of all aspects does not concord in type with the nature of consciousness, it is ‘inconceivable.’ It is stainless’ because the inseparable aspects or nature of this knowledge of all aspects rep­resent supreme purity. It is ‘inseparable from’ all consummate ‘qualities.’ ‘Liberation’ is what possesses these characteristics.* ‘What is liberation is the Tathagata’ because the single nature that is labeled with various names from the perspective of isolates (such as ‘tathagata,’ ‘awakening endowed with these four qualities,’ and ‘the seven vajra points, such as the basic element’) is unconditioned and permanent. This nature of phenom­ena is not something unconditioned and permanent in the sense of merely negating its being conditioned and impermanent, though it is distinguished through negating these two. It is unconditioned in the sense of not being conditioned through specifically characterized conditional formations, and it is permanent in the sense of not being something like an impermanent phenomenon that represents an entity which appears for (ordinary) mental states.. . . As for the manner in which the nature of phenomena and the Tathagata are permanent entities, ultimately, as the object of self-aware wisdom, liberation—the Tathagata endowed with the four qualities—abides as an entity that is able to perform functions. It is permanent because a situation of it becoming interrupted is impossible, that is, liberation and the Tathagata can never be reversed and change into something else. Also, the intention of glorious Dignaga and Dharmaklrti is nothing but this—the opening lines of the Pramanasamuccaya say:To the one who embodies valid cognition and wishes to benefit beings,The teacher, the Sugata and protector, I pay homage.Thus, the fruition that arises from the cooperative cause which consists of the consum­mate motivation and application of this motivation—the teacher who has the character of being the Sugata in terms of his own welfare and performing the activity of protec­tion in terms of the welfare of others—is clearly described as an entity. In accordance with this, the opening verse of the Pramdnavdrttika says:To the embodiment of profundity and vastness In which the web of conceptions is eliminated,The ever-excellent one, whose light Radiates everywhere, I pay homage.Thus, it teaches on the entity that performs the function of the light rays of the pro­found and vast kayas radiating, and the phrase, ‘radiates everywhere’ indicates that thisradiating is not something intermittent, but is displayed permanently___‘But how does permanent liberation—the dharmadhatu, emptiness—produce the entity that performs the function of promoting the welfare of others?’ In the above example in the Uttaratantra, when the one painter who is the expert in painting heads is missing ... the painted form of the king will not be complete in that it lacks the head. Likewise, on the path of learning, the stains that obscure permanent liberation are removed and liberation is excellently accomplished through the means (such as the ten paramitas) that produce the appearance of the two genuine kayas. Therefore, the genuine perma­nent emptiness that has been accomplished through its being endowed with all aspects of the means is described as the entity that is able to perform functions and serves as the kaya or the form of the nature of phenomena. For, without each and every aspect of"},{"pageNumber":1173,"pageContent":"Notes 1157said means being complete, the two kayas of perfect buddhahood will not clearly mani­fest. Thus, with the pure mirrors of the mind streams of the beings to be guided serving as the remedial factors and through the power of the dependent origination within the facet of their minds that is the lucid and aware cognition which is close to the nature of genuine liberation and accords in its realization with the nature of phenomena, the obscurations of sentient beings are relinquished in dependence on the aspects of the rupakayas appearing in said facet of their minds by virtue of permanent liberation— the Tathagata—functioning as the dominant condition for such appearance. Since the functions such as generating the remedies arise or are accomplished naturally, despite the Tathagata s being permanent, by way of profound dependent origination, the triad of agent, object, and action is justified. The example to illuminate that this is justified is as follows. Though all seeming and ultimate phenomena are permanent emptiness, it is seen that, through the principle of dependent origination, the triad of agent, object, and action operates in a conventional manner on the level of the seeming. This is the way in which the Yogacara masters present this justification and its example to the Nihsvabhavavadins.”2201. CMW mchog tu hden emended to mchog dang Idan.2202. Rngog lo tsa ba bio Idan shes rab 1993b, fols. 39b.5-40a.4.2203. CMW mistakenly has sho lo ka gnyis.2204. The Uttaratantra’s section on the nine examples starts with 1.99/102 and ends with 1.152/155, thus there are fifty-four verses on the nine examples. That CMW speaks of fifty-three seems to be due to having mistakenly correlated two verses (instead of one) with the previous heading.2205.1 follow GC and JKC bdag can against all versions in DP and HLS bdag cag.2206.1 follow Ut (D) and HLS tshogs against RGW (DP) sogs.2207.

Ut (D) mistakenly has dri med instead of dri ma.2213. CMW gnyis pai emended to gnyis pas.2214. Due to the different syntax of the English of 1.132, this refers to the phrase “within the beginningless cocoons of the afflictions that are not connected to the basic element of sentient beings.”2215. This refers to the phrase “The beginningless stainlessness of the nature of the mind ... is declared to be.”2216. CMW bstan pa’i emended to bstan pas.2217. CMW phyed po emended to phyed dangpo.2218. This whole explanation is based on the ambiguousness of the Tibetan term rgyu mthun pa for Skt. nisyanda (“natural outflow” or “necessary consequence or result”). Its meaning in Uttaratantra 1.145/148 and RG W is obviously that teaching the principles of profundity and diversity to others is the natural outflow or result of the dharmakaya of a buddha, which in turn leads to others attaining the dharmakaya too. However, the Tibetan rgyu mthun pa can mean either “what is concordant with its cause” or “con­cordant cause” (used in both ways in Tibetan texts), thus referring to either the result that is concordant in type with its cause or the cause that is concordant in type with its result. The first meaning corresponds to the Sanskrit nisyanda, while the second one"},{"pageNumber":1174,"pageContent":"1158 Notesrepresents the understanding of this term here in CMW. Thus, CMW refers first to the fact that the rupakayas are the cause for other beings’ attaining the dharmakaya, with that cause that is concordant with that dharmakaya of others as its result. Secondly, the dharmakaya of a buddha is also a concordant cause, that is, the cause for the result that consists of the dharma’s being taught by the rupakayas of that buddha.2219. CMW de'i emended to des.2220. As other commentaries show, dge ba for Skt. kalyanatva in all Tibetan versions of the Uttaratantra is to be understood here as “excellent.”2221. The seven jewels of royalty are ruby, sapphire, beryl, emerald, diamond, pearl, and coral. An alternative list consists of beryl, gold, silver, crystal, white coral (musdragalva), red pearl, and emerald.2222. For example, Mahdyanasamgraha 1.1 (D4048, fol. 3a.7).2223. The Tibetan term kun gzhi for alaya means “basis of all.”2224. CMW zagpa am emended to zagpa med padm.2225. Differing from this quote in the three texts mentioned, CMW omits “consciousness” both here and in the following instance.2226. As a literal quote, this is found only in Mahdyanasamgraha 1.3 (D4048, fol. 3b. 1-2). Sthiramati’s Madhyantavibhagatika (Pandeya ed., 1999, 26.29-30; D4032, fol. 205a.6) has the same passage without the initial question and “all afflicted phenomena” is re­placed by “all contaminated phenomena.” Sthiramatis Pancaskandhaprakaranavai- bhasya (D4066, fol. 232b. 1-4) contains a passage with different wording but to the same effect. Another passage in it (fol. 238a.6-7) says, “‘Why is it called “alaya-con- sciousness”?’ This alaya-consciousness is the very basis of all seeds.”2227. CMW mkhan po’i emended to mkhanpos.2228. The fragmentary Vivrtagudharthapindavyakhya (a commentary on about three-quar­ters of the first chapter of the Mahdyanasamgraha) is sometimes attributed to Vasu- bandhu. CMW obviously refers here to the following passage in that text (D4052, fol. 31 lb. 1-5): “[The phrase] ‘all afflicted phenomena, which entail arising, adhere to it as being its results.. .* is stated in this way because [afflicted phenomena] are the majority [in the alaya-consciousness]—the realms of sentient beings are mosdy afflicted. Some [beings] who are not afflicted are nonlearners, bodhisattvas who dwell on the eighth bhumi [and above], and so on. It is not that what represents the alaya-consciousnesses of these [beings] does not serve as the support of purified phenomena. During the phase of being afflicted, it is the naturally abiding disposition and the accomplished [disposition] that represent the cause of purified phenomena. However, they are not asserted as the alaya because they are not the primary factors [in the alaya] during the phase [of being afflicted] and because they do not exist substantially [in it]. Therefore, when the conventional term ‘alaya’ appears to designate merely being a cause with­out [further] specification, it also refers to the fundamental change, as it is found in the Mahdparinirvdnasutras statement ‘The sambhogakaya consists of the alaya-con­sciousness and the active consciousnesses.’ Here, no matter whether it is said that other [phenomena] adhere to it or that it adheres to other [phenomena], in both cases, the alaya has solely the nature of a cause.”2229. The preserved portion of the Vivrtagudhdrthapindavyakhya (or any other Indian commentary on the Mahdyanasamgraha) does not mention a metal bowl when refer­ring to the example of a mixture of water and milk. This example for the coexistence of the alaya-consciousness and the latent tendencies of listening (with the latter s being the remedies for the former) is found in Mahdyanasamgraha 1.46 (D4048, fol. 10b.5)."},{"pageNumber":1175,"pageContent":"Notes 11592230. Again, this example is not found in the preserved portion of the Vivrta- güdhàrthapindavyâkhyâ but in Mahâyânasamgraha 1.49 (D4048, fol. lla.5). It also ap­pears in verses 62-63 of Nàgârjuna’s Dharmadhâtustava, illustrating the process of yogins extracting buddha wisdom from the body and leaving ignorance behind. To provide the context of this discussion in the Mahâyânasamgraha and the Vivrtagûdhârthapindavyâkhyâ, the following is a translation of the relevant passages in these two texts. Mahâyânasamgraha 1.45-49 (D4049, fols. 10b.2-lla.6) says: “[1.45] ‘If the maturational consciousness that contains all seeds is the cause of afflicted phenom­ena, how could it be acceptable as the seed of its remedy—the supramundane mind?’ Since the supramundane mind is not mixed [with the âlaya-consciousness], the latent tendencies of this [supramundane mind] do not exist [in it]. ‘But if these latent tenden­cies do not exist [in it], it must be stated from which seeds they arise.’ The [supramun­dane mind] arises from the seeds that are the latent tendencies of listening, which are the natural outflow of the completely pure dharmadhâtu. [1.46] ‘So are these latent tendencies of listening then of the nature of the âlaya-consciousness [or are they not]? If they are of the nature of the âlaya-consciousness, how could they be acceptable as the seeds of its remedy? But if they are not of its nature, what is consequently regarded as the matrix of these seeds that are the latent tendencies of listening?’ As for the matrix within which the latent tendencies of listening [that operate] in dependence on the awakening of buddhas operate, they operate within the maturational consciousness in a manner of coexisting with it, just like [a mixture of] milk and water. They are not the âlaya-consciousness because they are the very seeds of its remedy. [1.47] Here, based on small latent tendencies, they become medium latent tendencies, and based on medium latent tendencies, they become great latent tendencies. For they entail listening, reflec­tion, and meditation being performed many times. [1.48] Now, the small, medium, and great latent tendencies of listening are regarded as the seeds of the dharmakáya. Since they are the remedy of the âlaya-consciousness, they are not of the nature of the âlaya-consciousness. They are something mundane, but since they are the natural out­flow of the supramundane completely pure dharmadhâtu, they serve as the seeds of the supramundane mind. Even when the supramundane mind has not yet arisen, these [latent tendencies] are the remedy for being ensnared by the afflictions, the remedy for migrating in the miserable realms, and the remedy that makes all wrongdoing vanish. They are [also] conducive to meeting buddhas and bodhisattvas. Though [the latent tendencies of listening] of beginner bodhisattvas are mundane, [these latent tenden­cies] are regarded as being included in the dharmakáya and those of ¿ràvakas and pratyekabuddhas as being included in the vimuktikàya. They are not the âlaya-con­sciousness but are included in the dharmakáya and vimuktikàya, respectively. To the extent that they gradually increase from being small to being medium to being great, to that same extent the maturational consciousness wanes and also undergoes the funda­mental change. If it has undergone this fundamental change in all respects, the matura­tional consciousness that contained all seeds is then without [any] seeds and is also relinquished in all aspects. [1.49] ‘How can the âlaya-consciousness, which coexists with what is not the âlaya-consciousness like water and milk, wane in all aspects?’ This is like wild geese drinking [by separating] milk from water. It is also similar to the following: as one becomes free from mundane desire, the latent tendencies of the level of not be­ing in meditative equipoise wane, while the latent tendencies of the level of being in meditative equipoise increase until [finally there occurs] the fundamental change.” The Vivrtagüdliàrthapindavyâkhyâ (D4052, fol. 357b.6-361a.6) comments on this as fol­lows: “ [1.45] ‘How could the âlaya-consciousness, which is the cause of afflicted"},{"pageNumber":1176,"pageContent":"ii6 o Notesphenomena, be acceptable as the seed of its own remedy? Poison is not suitable as the seed of nectar.’ ... In order to relinquish both of these qualms, [the text] says, ‘[The supramundane mind] arises from the seeds.’ Here, the dharmadhàtu is suchness. Since it is also perfectly pure by nature, it is in terms of its temporary purity [in bodhisattvas] that [the text] says ‘completely pure.’ In this regard, [the dharmadhàtu] of šrávakas and pratyekabuddhas is [said to be just] pure. Since [the dharmadhàtu] of tathàgatas is freefrom both obscurations, it is completely pure [1.46] The passage ‘As for the matrix. . teaches that that support is nothing but the àlaya-consciousness The phrase ‘thematrix within which [they operate]’ [means that they operate] in the mind streams of sentient beings. That [the text] says ‘they operate within the maturational conscious­ness in a manner of coexisting with it’ is because to say ‘àlaya-consciousness’ is not in­clusive [enough]. That is, the [àlaya-consciousness] does not exist in the mind streams of bodhisattvas who dwell on the eighth bhümi and so on, nor in the mind streams of arhats and pratyekabuddhas, but the maturational consciousness does exist [in those mind streams]. Also, it is not the case that the latent tendencies for listening become one with the seeds of afflicted phenomena [just] because they are contained in the same support. For, just like [in a mixture of] milk and water, their own specific characteristics are different. ‘If the seeds that are conducive to merit and the seeds of desire and so on have different characteristics in that way and therefore abide like [a mixture of] milk and water, what preeminence do these [former seeds] have?’ Therefore, [the text] says, ‘They are not the àlaya-consciousness.’ This means that the intention [behind this] is that [the two kinds of seeds] have different characteristics by virtue of [the formers] having the nature of being the remedy [of the latter] and not just by virtue of [their having] different results. [Thus, the seeds] that are conducive to merit are also the rem­edy of the àlaya-consciousness. Just as a poison and a medicine that eliminates poison can exist in a single support, this too should be understood like that. One is also not able to say that these latent tendencies are not suitable as the remedy of afflicted phenomena because they cannot be expressed as being the same as or other than the àlaya-consciousness. For this is not certain by virtue of suchness [1.48] According to theview of others, the dharmakâya has the characteristics of the uncontaminated skand- has of discipline and so on, and these [latent tendencies] are the seeds that produce the [dharmakâya]. According to our own view, the dharmakâya has the characteristic of suchness, and these [latent tendencies] should be understood as the seeds that make one attain the [dharmakâya]. ‘Why should they be understood in that way?’ The sen­tence ‘Since they are the remedy of the àlaya-consciousness, they are not of the nature of the àlaya-consciousness’ teaches the reason for what was said. ‘If it is explained that they are not of the nature of the àlaya-consciousness since they are the seeds that are its remedy, how are they its remedial seeds?* Therefore, [the text] says, ‘They are some­thing mundane, but since they are the natural outflow of the supramundane completely pure dharmadhàtu...’ For these mundane [remedial seeds] engage during the phase of seeing true reality. When these seeds are specified in terms of their qualities, they are what induces the remedy. Therefore, [the text] continues, ‘Even when the supramun­dane mind has not yet arisen, these [latent tendencies]...’ This teaches that they are the aids that are the remedy for the [three] afflictivenesses of afflictions, birth, and karma . . . . [1.49] ‘As for its having been explained above that they are the seeds of the dhar- makàya, which ones are the seeds of the dharmakâya?’ Therefore, [the text] says, ‘Though [the latent tendencies of listening] of beginner bodhisattvas are mundane.. .* This explains that they are included in the dharmakâya because they are the cause of the dharmakâya. Here, since the suchness that is liberated from [all] afflictive and"},{"pageNumber":1177,"pageContent":"Notes 1161cognitive obscurations including their latent tendencies is the support of [all buddha] dharmas (such as the powers and fearlessnesses), it is called ‘dharmakaya.* ‘In which kàya are the [latent tendencies for listening] of beginners who have the dispositions of ¿râvakas and pratyekabuddhas included?* [The text] says that those ‘are included in the vimuktikâya... .* It is called ‘vimuktikâya* because it has the nature of being liberated from the afflictive obscurations. As for [the phrase] ‘to that same extent the matura­tional consciousness wanes,’ [this happens] in the phase of the vajra-like samâdhi. That it ‘also undergoes the fundamental change’ means that it becomes the dharmakaya that is characterized by being suchness. The phrase ‘the maturational consciousness wanes’ refers to [such waning happening] during the state of the vajra-like samâdhi. The phrase ‘also undergoes the fundamental change means that it becomes the dharmakaya that has the characteristic of suchness. This is explained with regard to the tathagatas. ‘If it has undergone this fundamental change in all respects’ means ‘if the foundation that is suchness has changed into the vimuktikâya.’ ‘The maturational consciousness that contained all seeds is then without [any] seeds’ means that all seeds of afflicted phenomena have been relinquished. This is explained with regard to the nirvana with the remainder of the skandhas of ¿rávaka and pratyekabuddha nonlearners because in that [nirvana, karmic] maturation is impossible in all respects. [Some] raise discussions such as, ‘It was explained [above] that [the latent tendencies of listening] operate within [the maturational consciousness] in a manner of coexisting with it. [But] at the end here it is also explained that the maturational consciousness wanes. Therefore, how is it?’ It is well known that ‘this is like wild geese drinking [by separating] milk from wa­ter.’ This means that though [both contaminated and uncontaminated seeds] operate [within the àlaya-consciousness] as having the nature of [existing] together [in it], some become exhausted in their entirety, while some [others—the uncontaminated seeds—] consist of those that do not deteriorate. The passage ‘as one becomes free from mundane desire . ..’ teaches the following. It should be understood that for those who do not present the àlaya-consciousness, there is a fundamental change in a single sup­port due to the latent tendencies of the afflicted phenomena of the sphere of desire deteriorating through being overcome by the mundane path that operates as having the nature of [existing] together with the latent tendencies of the level of not being in meditative equipoise, while the latent tendencies of the level of being in meditative equipoise are caused to increase. Likewise, it should be understood that for those who present the àlaya-consciousness, the supramundane [seeds] increase in all aspects and the seeds of afflicted phenomena are relinquished without exception. I think that the phrase ‘It is also similar to ... the fundamental change’ refers to the fundamental change of suchness.” Note that, as above, the Yogàcàra system in general distinguishes the vi- muktikàya and the dharmakâya such that the former designates the removal of only the afflictive obscurations as attained by ¿rávaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, while the lat­ter refers to the removal of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations (thus including the vimuktikâya) and also represents the realization of the nonconceptual wisdom of a buddha. By contrast, Uttaratantra 11.21-26 describes these two kàyas as the two aspects of the function of awakening that represent one’s own welfare, without relating them to the distinction between arhats and buddhas. The vimuktikâya is said to represent bud- dhahood’s quality of being uncontaminated (because the afflictions together with their latent tendencies have ceased) and its quality of being all-pervasive (because its wisdom is without attachment and obstruction). The dharmakâya is the unconditioned matrix of buddhahood, which is due to its absolutely indestructible nature."},{"pageNumber":1178,"pageContent":"ii6 2 Notes2231.

For an interesting alternative answer to this question, see the Eighth Situpa’s com­mentary on the Third Karmapa’s Aspiration Prayer of Mahâmudrâ (41-43) presented in chapter “The Uttaratantra and Mahâmudrâ.”2241. According to GC (446.25-449.16), 1.159 contains two qualms—“If this basic element so difficult to see is not even an object for the noble ones on the bhümi free from attach­ment, what is the point of teaching the third dharma wheel to ordinary beings?” and “Since the second and third dharma wheels are contradictory in meaning, isn’t one of them to be rejected?” The first qualm is answered by stating the purpose of eliminating the five flaws. The second one is answered by saying that the teaching on the exis­tence of the tathâgata heart does not contradict the explanation of the lack of nature in the prajnàpàramità sûtras because that teaching is an explanation of what was not explained clearly before. When the prajnàpàramità sûtras speak of being cloud-like and so on, this is not a statement that all knowable objects are like clouds and so on. Rather, among the two realities, the prajnàpàramità sûtras take ultimate reality—the true end— as the basis of emptiness and then say that it is void of all aspects of conditioned phe­nomena. Through thus negating that conditioned phenomena are the ultimate, they teach that the ultimate is empty of conditioned phenomena, but that does not mean that separately from conditioned phenomena, there exists an ultimate that is different in nature from them. For these sûtras say, “Subhüti, there is neither a worldly seeming reality that is other nor an ultimate that is other. It is the very suchness of the seeming that is ultimate reality.” Nor is it the case that through negating that seeming phenom­ena are the ultimate, the basis of negation (the ultimate) becomes nonexistent—the ultimate is explicitly and clearly asserted in these sûtras. In the last dharma wheel too, it is taught that the ultimate is empty of what is adventitious because phenomena such as desire are not the ultimate since they are adventitious. However, since these adventi­tious stains do not occupy the slightest location other than the ultimate basic element,"},{"pageNumber":1179,"pageContent":"Notes 1163it is also taught that this element is the foundation of all afflicted phenomena. Likewise, the svabhavikakaya of a buddha is explained to be unfabricated, while it is taught that what exists in sentient beings is merely something that is similar in kind to it. Since it is realized by the direct seeing of the noble ones alone, it is also expressed as “the ulti­mate” because it is the object of ultimate cognition. The instruction that the tathagata heart exists in all sentient beings, which was not taught clearly in the second dharma wheel, clearly teaches the substantial cause of buddhahood because the stains are obvi­ously not the substantial cause of buddhahood. If this cause is accepted to be empty of everything that has the nature of an entity, there is not the slightest invalidation of this through prajnaparamita scriptures or reasonings. Also, the statement that emptiness does definitely not exist is not a negation of the emptiness that is ultimate reality, but it is a negation of an emptiness that is deliberately imagined by thoughts. This is also taught by Midamadhyamakakarika XIII.7cd:If there is not the slightest being nonempty,How could being empty exist?The meanings of afflictions, karma, and their maturations are illustrated by the exam­ples of clouds and so on in the third dharma wheel too. Afflictions are like clouds be­cause they arise in an adventitious manner and cover the basic element. Karmic actions are like dream experiences because though they are formed as nothing but something delusive, their results are seen. The skandhas that are the maturations accomplished by afflictions and karma are like illusions and magical creations because while they do not exist when examined, they display as something like sentient beings. Just as it was taught before in the second dharma wheel that afflictions and so on are like clouds and so on, the same is taught later in the third wheel too, but thereafter this wheel also teaches that the basic element that is liberated from afflictions, karma, and their maturations exists. This is done in order to eliminate the five flaws in ordinary beings because these five are obstacles to the mahayana path. As for GCs explanation of ulti­mate reality as “the object of ultimate cognition,” Bhaviveka’s Tarkajvdld (D3856, fol. 59a.7-59b.2) lists three different ways in which the Sanskrit compound paramdrtha can be read. He says that artha (“object,” “purpose,” or “actuality”) refers to what is to be understood, realized, or examined. Parama means “supreme.” Thus, (1) since paramdrtha is an object and ultimate (or supreme), it is the ultimate object (technically, a karmadharaya compound). (2) Or it may be read as “the object of the ultimate.” Since it is the object of ultimate nonconceptual wisdom, it is the object of the ultimate (a tat- purusa compound). (3) Or it can be understood as “that which is in accordance with the ultimate object” (a bahuvrihi compound). Since the ultimate object exists in the prajna that is in approximate accordance with the realization of this ultimate object, it is what is in accordance with the ultimate object. In other words, in (1), both parama and artha refer only to the object as opposed to the subject that realizes it. (2) means that parama refers to the subject (wisdom) and artha to the object (emptiness). (3) indicates a rea­soning consciousness that cognizes ultimate reality not directly but inferentially. Fol­lowing Bhaviveka, the majority of Indian *Svatantrikas seem to favor the second way of reading paramdrtha, while not denying the first. Candraklrtis Prasannapadd (D3860, fol. 163b.5-6) explicitly sides with (1). Yogacaras typically explain the ultimate along the lines of (1) and (2) as being twofold in terms of subject and object. For example, Sthiramatis commentary on Mahdydnasutralamkara VI. 1 (D4034, fols. 74a.3-75b.l) says that the ultimate consists of suchness (the pure dharmadhatu) and nondual non­conceptual wisdom. Suchness is called the ultimate since it is the fruition of having cultivated the path of the noble ones and represents all phenomena. Or, in terms of its"},{"pageNumber":1180,"pageContent":"ii64 Notesbeing an object, it is the ultimate because it is the object of ultimate nonconceptual wis­dom. Obviously, GC’s explanation here corresponds to (2). Mipham’s commentary (’Ju mi pham rgya mtsho 1984b, 434.3-435.3) presents the same two qualms with regard to 1.159 as GC and answers the first one as above. The answer to the second qualm is that the earlier statement that all phenomena from form up through omniscience lack real existence is a teaching from the perspective of the essence of the expanse’s being empty. The statement here that the sugata heart exists is not saying that its nature is really exis­tent, but it is a teaching from the perspective of the nature of awareness-wisdom’s being lucid. Therefore, these two are not only not contradictory but they are a unity because they are aids for each other. For YDCs general presentation of the purpose of teaching the tathagata heart and its comments on 1.161-63, see appendix 6.2242. CMW thob emended to thos.2243. CMW nyon mongs... mthongyangzhe na is odd and, given the context, interpreted as this question. The same goes for the next question in the text below.2244. CMW Itos te emended to nyes de.2245. CMW bdag cag emended to bdag chags.2246. GC (449.16-451.6) explains that (1) the flaw of faintheartedness is an obstacle to giv­ing rise to bodhicitta. (3)—(4) In those who, due to having generated bodhicitta, think of themselves as being superior to those who did not generate it, perfect wisdom—the opposite of the views about a real personality—will not arise. Therefore, since they cling to unreal afflictions and do not realize the tathagata heart, they fall away from both prajna and compassion. The flaws of sentient beings are unreal and mistaken be­cause they are eagerly fabricated by conceptions and because a self and phenomena are adventitious stains that are eagerly superimposed while actually being nonexistent. The qualities of the tathagata heart are naturally pure because they are without any owner since the afflictions of sentient beings, when examined, lack any nature of their own. Through views about a self, real existence is superimposed onto unreal flaws and the existence of what has the nature of real qualities is denied. (5) Due to that, one will not develop the love for sentient beings that arises by virtue of seeing that oneself and sen­tient beings are equal in that the tathagata heart, which is free from reference points and lacks the characteristics of the skandhas, is the disposition of both oneself and others. In the scriptures, there are three ways in which bodhisattvas see themselves and sen­tient beings as equal—being equal in wishing to attain happiness and to avoid suffering, being equal in lacking any essence ultimately, and being equal in the basic ground of the mind, natural luminosity. Without hearing and knowing that the tathagata heart is the heart within all views about a real personality, one does not disdain views about a self. Therefore, excessive attachment to oneself is the root of the other four flaws here because one is fainthearted about oneself, is proud about oneself, clings to ones own particular features as being real, and sees the lack of a self as a mistake. The opposites of these five flaws—the five qualities of ardor and so on—are nothing but the four causes for purifying the tathagata heart in 1.34 (faith in the mahayana, prajna, samadhi, and compassion). Ardor for accomplishing the buddha qualities is the result of faith. To respect all beings like the teacher is the faith that the teacher and beings are equal in terms of the naturally pure dharmakaya. Prajna obviously corresponds to prajna, wisdom means to cultivate the samadhis that serve as treasures of qualities, and love is what leads to compassion. Likewise, the five flaws correspond to the four obscurations to those four causes. Though being fainthearted about accomplishing buddhahood is not actual anger, it resembles anger or hostility toward the dharma and turning one’s back to it. Pride about oneself and clinging to what is unreal represent views about a"},{"pageNumber":1181,"pageContent":"Notes 1165self. Not understanding that the tathâgata heart with its qualities abides within oneself corresponds to fear of samsàra’s suffering. Lacking love and compassion corresponds to indifference about the welfare of sentient beings.2247. In accordance with the context and the next section, CMW btags is emended to rtogs.2248. RYC (139-41) comments that according to the Abhidharmasamuccaya, “the true end” refers to the unmistaken focal object. Thus, it is the ultimate of what is unmis­taken—the tathâgata heart that serves as the focal object of unmistaken nonconceptual wisdom and is void of delusive, deceiving, and conditioned phenomena in all aspects. Conditioned phenomena are what the statements in the prajnàpàramitàsütra in one hundred thousand lines and so on have in mind when they say that all phenomena are like clouds and so on. The afflictions are like clouds because they are not the nature of the mind and are pervasive and adventitious. The karmas motivated by them resem­ble experiences in a dream because they arise from mistaken conditions and appear as certain experiences despite not existing as entities. The skandhas and so on (the maturational results of afflictions and karma) are like the magical manifestations in an illusion because they arise from conditions and lack real existence. After conditioned phenomena were presented like this in the middle cycle of the Buddhas teachings, in this ultimate continuum here, which means “in later sûtras,” that is, in the sûtras and treatises of the last turning that ascertains the ultimate, it is said that the basic element exists because buddhahood is swiftly attained by relinquishing the five flaws and giving rise to the five qualities instead. Therefore, what the statements in the middle cycle of the Buddha s teaching about all phenomena’s lacking real existence have in mind are seeming conditioned phenomena, whereas the statements in the final cycle about the sugata hearts being real and changeless have the ultimate unconditioned dharmadhâtu in mind. As for the third and fourth among the five flaws, since the stains of sentient beings are adventitious, they are not real, but those who have not heard the teachings on the tathâgata heart cling to them as being real and not adventitious. On the other hand, ultimately, since the stains do not exist as the nature of the mind and are adventitious, the qualities exist by nature. Still, those who have not heard about the tathâgata heart do not realize the existence of these qualities and even deny their existence. Therefore, they cling to the adventitious stains as being the nature of the mind and deny the exis­tence of the naturally existent real qualities. Through hearing about the tathâgata heart, they then develop the prajnà of realizing the stains to be adventitious and the wisdom of realizing the naturally existent qualities. All of this is the answer to the question, “If the tathâgata heart is not even realized by bodhisattvas on the final bhümi, what is the point of teaching it to ordinary beings?” For, through teaching that the tathâgata heart exists in all sentient beings, though ordinary beings do not realize it as it is, based on trustworthy scriptures, they do realize a mere fraction of it through trusting faith. Thus, when trust in the existence of the tathâgata heart arises, this serves as the remedy for the five flaws and the five qualities will arise in them.2249. Ut (D) and R G W (DP) rang bzhin don emended to rang gzhan don.2250. CMW de rtogs pa gcig is more probably de rtogs byed.2251. The words in “[ ]” are added in CMW in “{}.”2252. GC (472.8-14) explains that the supramundane wisdom of meditative equipoise en­gages knowable objects properly and lacks conceptions and obscurations since these are mundane. When rising from this meditative equipoise, the pure mundane wisdom that is attained subsequent to this meditative equipoise through its power consists of venerating buddhas, purifying buddha realms, and maturing sentient beings through all kinds of phenomena of seeming reality appearing at that time. Since this wisdom"},{"pageNumber":1182,"pageContent":"n66 Notesdoes not directly see ultimate reality, it does not engage properly in knowable objects and is the subject that cognizes seeming reality. Therefore, it is itself a phenomenon that is an obscuration. For both this reason and because its own nature is conceptual, it is mundane. Though it lacks the conceptions that blend terms and their referents, it is described as conceptual by virtue of the dualistic phenomena that appear to it. Also, below the seventh bhumi, it entails subtle conceptions that blend terms and their referents.2253. CMW stongpa emended to ston pa.2254. CMW kyis emended to kyi.2255.

CMW ’grel pai emended to ’grel pas.2267. GC (484) says that the first characteristic refers to the dharmakaya or svabhavika­kaya being without arising, remaining, and ceasing. The second one means that it is inseparable from the qualities such as the ten powers. The third one means that it lacks the two extremes and is not a middle either. The fourth one means that it is free from the three kinds of obscurations—afflictive, cognitive, and those of meditative absorp­tion. The fifth one means that it is uncommon because it cannot be made an object by conceptions and is only seen by yogins who are endowed with the wisdom of the med­itative equipoise of a buddha. JKC (146) agrees with GCs descriptions of the first and the fourth characteristics, but calls the latter “the characteristic of purity.” The second characteristic of being undifferentiable means that the dhatu and awareness cannot be separated as being different. The third characteristic of being unmistaken means that the dharmakaya does not exist in the two extremes of superimposition and denial. The fifth characteristic of luminosity means that it is naturally stainless and does not exist as an object of the conceptions of dialecticians.2268. CMW khams emended to lam.2269. In accordance with two of the meanings of the Sanskrit verb budh, the Tibetan sangs rgyas for buddhahood consists of the two words “awakening” and “unfolding.”2270.

RYC (165-67) quotes the section of the Ratnadarikasutra on the ten powers, which also includes their individual causes. Accordingly, in due order, these causes are (1) its never being the case for bodhisattvas that they desire the hlnayana and do what should not be done, (2) bodhisattvas teaching the karmic maturations that come from"},{"pageNumber":1183,"pageContent":"Notes il 67one’s own actions, (3) their teaching the dharma by examining the faculties of beings, (4) their knowing the different constitutions of beings and then acting according to these constitutions, (5) their searching for the wisdom of liberation in accordance with the different inclinations of beings and not putting down any such inclinations, (6) their directing their wisdom toward conditioned and uncontaminated phenomena, the ¿ravakayana, the pratyekabuddhayana, and the mahayana in their entirety, (7) their emphasizing dhyanas and samadhis and thus realizing the mind and being free from afflictions, that is, being tamed and knowing everything, (8) their not wasting the roots of virtue that arise from previous causes and thus being heedful and not breaking the vows they took, (9) their never discouraging any beings, not faking what they did not learn, and illuminating all sentient beings, and (10) their not being present in order to increase contaminations but teaching the path of the dharma in order to terminate the contaminations. GC (511-14) also lists these causes without referring to the sutra.2275. The four maras are not mentioned as such in the Mahdydnasutralamkdra but its Bhasya on XXI.51 (Limaye 1992, 526-27; D4026, fol. 258a. 1-5) says: “Here, the maras who deceive sentient beings with regard to four points are vanquished [by the Buddha]. This teaches the function of the ten powers of the Bhagavan. [The maras deceive in four ways] as follows: (1) they deceive [beings] about the means for progressing to happy realms and miserable realms, (2) they deceive them about those who are not refuges (such as gods) as being refuges, (3) they deceive them about [actual] purity through contaminated [forms of] purity, and (4) they deceive them about the final deliverance through the mahayana. One should understand that through the power of knowing what is the case and what is not the case, the Bhagavan vanquishes the maras with regard to the first point. Through the power of knowing the maturation of karma, [he vanquishes the maras] with regard to the second [point]. Through the power of know­ing dhyanas, liberations, samadhis, and meditative absorptions, [he vanquishes the maras] with regard to the third [point]. Through the [remaining] powers of knowing higher faculties and those that are not higher and so on, [he vanquishes the maras] with regard to the fourth [point] because after relinquishing the inferior faculties, he joins [those to be guided] with the higher ones.” Asvabhava’s Mahdydnasutrdlamkdratlka (D4029, fol. 172a.l-172b.2) adds on point (1) that the maras make one engage in things such as sacrificing cattle or entering a fire, which are not means to progress to happy realms. Through the power of knowing what is and what is not the case, the Buddha knows that killing leads to rebirth in the hells and so on but not in happy existences. Thus, he not only correctly knows a cause for something as being this cause and a result of something as being this result but also annihilates the wrong views of ¿ramanas and Brahmans who propound causelessness and discordant causes. As for (2), the gods are not a refuge because they do not know the path to final deliverance. Since they do not know the means for liberation, they are not able to protect sentient beings from all fears in samsara in general and the lower realms in particular. However, the maras present the gods as mundane refuges, who deceive worldly beings through their miraculous powers and so on. As for (4), maras denigrate the mahayana in front of beginner bodhi­sattvas, thus turning them away from bodhisattva conduct and joining them with the ¿ravakayana. Through his remaining seven powers, the Buddha vanquishes such maras, teaching bodhisattva conduct to bodhisattvas and joining them with it. Differing from this explanation, the more common use of the term “the four maras” refers to the mara of the skandhas, the mara of the afflictions, the mara of death, and the devaputramara (attachment to sense pleasures or meditation experiences)."},{"pageNumber":1184,"pageContent":"n68 Notes2276. RYC (169-70) quotes the section of the Ratnadarikdsutra on the four fearlessnesses, which also includes their individual causes. According to this sutra, the four fearless­nesses are expressed in the following statements by a buddha in the middle of those who surround him, which he proclaims as fearlessly as a lion roars among other an­imals and that cannot be disputed by anyone in accordance with the dharma: (1) “I am a completely perfect buddha,” (2) “I teach all phenomena that are obstructions to that,” (3) “I teach all pure phenomena,” and (4) “I have terminated all contaminations.” In due order, these four are the expressions of a buddhas complete realization of all phenomena that can be known, teaching that all obstacles to that are to be put to an end, teaching that one needs to rely on the path that leads to buddhahood, and stating that he himself has attained the cessation in which all contaminations and their latent tendencies have come to an end. The causes of these four are that bodhisattvas (1) as teachers never hide any dharmas from others but have an unbiased mind toward all sentient beings, give all material goods, and see all phenomena as equality, thus being free from any notions of difference, (2) know all obstructions to buddhahood as being such obstructions, just as they are, do not engage in them but relinquish them, and do not teach them to others as anything other than being such obstructions, (3) through always aspiring for pure dharmas, enter the path of purified phenomena and also teach these pure phenomena to all sentient beings so that the true nature of the qualities becomes manifest, engage in the branches that enhance this path, and teach them to others, and (4) never pride themselves that they know and see while others do not know and see, but always are without pride and train their minds in discriminating wrongdoing. GC (515-16) also lists these cause in abbreviated form. In general, Tibetan commentaries say that among the four fearlessnesses, (1) and (4) represent ones own welfare in terms of realization and relinquishment, respectively, while (2) and (3) rep­resent the welfare of others in terms of teaching the factors to be relinquished and the path that is their remedy, respectively.2277. RYC (171-73) refers to the section of the Ratnadarikdsutra on the eighteen unique qualities, which also includes their individual causes. The causes of the six unique qualities of conduct are that bodhisattvas (I) build roads and bridges, offer lamps, and so on, (2) relinquish all flaws of words, (3) cultivate the six recollections (of Buddha, dharma, samgha, discipline, giving, and deities) and make others cultivate them too, (4) always guard the minds of others, do not create any obstacles to virtue, aspire for all phenomena as being illusion-like, and so on, (5) lack mistaken discriminating notions, and (6) always have continuous equanimity. The causes of the six unique qualities of realization are that bodhisattvas (7) always have the strong aspiration to seek for all kinds of virtue, (8) are insatiable in terms of never abandoning effort and accomplish­ing virtue, and so on, (9) always have consummate mindfulness, possess supreme mind­fulness and alertness, and cultivate the special foundations of mindfulness, (10) always engage in prajna and thus make efforts in seeking for the genuine dharma through being insatiable in terms of studying it and delighting in such study, and so on, (11) always delight in going into homelessness, stay in solitude, cultivate the three doors to liberation, and so on, and (12) always emphasize wisdom and thus are endowed with the power of wisdom and so on. The causes of the three unique qualities in terms of enlightened activity are that (13) the physical actions of bodhisattvas lack hostility, deception, hypocrisy, corrupt discipline, and so on, and always represent efforts for the welfare of sentient beings, (14) the verbal actions of bodhisattvas lack hostility and so on, are words of truth, and relinquish all flaws of speech, and (15) the mental actions of bodhisattvas lack hostility, are free from greed and so on, and are immersed in love and"},{"pageNumber":1185,"pageContent":"Notes 1169compassion, through which they have an unbiased mind toward all beings and do not forget their bodhicitta. Through these three sets of causes, the enlightened activities of a buddha’s body, speech, and mind are always preceded and followed by wisdom. The causes of the three unique qualities in terms of wisdom are as follows. (16) The wis­doms without attachment and obstruction, the qualities, and the enlightened activities of all buddhas of the three times are accomplished through aspiring for them and not having doubts about them. That is, through hearing about the qualities of the past bud­dhas, such as their wisdoms without attachment and obstruction, bodhisattvas aspire for these qualities and also make others aspire for them. Through that, as buddhas, they attain the wisdom vision that is without attachment and obstruction toward all past knowable objects. The same applies to (17)—(18) the unobscured wisdoms of the future and the present. RYC concludes by saying that these causes are the primary ones listed in the Ratnaddrikasutra, which also lists further causes—certain samadhis to be culti­vated and certain dharanls to be skilled in. These samadhis are listed in GC (518-19), which presents the following causes. Bodhisattvas (1) benefit sentient beings, seize the genuine dharma, and cultivate the All-Illuminating Samadhi, (2) speak the truth and cultivate the Samadhi of the King of Emanations, (3) cultivate the six recollections and the Samadhi of Mastering All Dharmas, (4) have an equal mind toward all sen­tient beings and cultivate the Samadhi of Manifesting the Equality That Is the Nature of All Phenomena, (5) lack mistaken discriminating notions and views and cultivate the Samadhi of Signlessness, (6) have equanimity toward the eight worldly dharmas and cultivate the Samadhi of Liberation from Attachment to Duality, (7) seek for the dharma through great aspiration and cultivate the Samadhi of the Mental Formation of Aspiration, (8) approach spiritual friends through making efforts in the dharma and so on and cultivate the Samadhi of Vigor, (9) cultivate the foundations of mindfulness and the Samadhi of Being Endowed with the Mental Formation of Mind Relinquishment, (10) frequently familiarize with prajna and cultivate the Samadhi of Being Endowed with the Mental Formation of Analysis, (11) after having gone into homelessness, cul­tivate the three doors to liberation, liberate other beings from stains, and cultivate the Samadhi of the Stainless Heart, (12) train in the wisdom of knowing reality, dependent origination, and so on, and cultivate the Samadhi of Establishing Power, (13) engage in all physical actions without afflictions and cultivate the Samadhi of Displaying All Forms, (14) engage in all verbal actions without afflictions and cultivate the Samadhi of the Jewel Mine, (15) engage in all mental actions without afflictions and cultivate the Samadhi of the Direct Presence of All Presently Living Buddhas, (16) aspire for all past buddhas infinite bodies, speeches, minds, pure realms, and promotions of the welfare of beings and cultivate the Samadhi of Heroic Stride, (17) aspire for the same features of all future buddhas and cultivate the Samadhi of the Rise of the Power and Aspira­tion Prayers of Great Compassion, and (18) aspire for the same features of all present buddhas and cultivate the Samadhi of the Very Pure and Stainless Mudra. Both RYC (173-74) and GC (518) list thirty-four more unique buddha qualities that are presented in the Ratnaddrikasutra, such as the body’s being without measure and being able to pacify the flaws of sentient beings right upon being seen.2278.

RYC (176-78) quotes the section of the Ratnaddrikasutra on the thirty-two major marks, which also includes their individual causes: bodhisattvas (1) being firm in their vows, (2) accumulating all kinds of generosity, (3) not putting down sentient beings,"},{"pageNumber":1186,"pageContent":"1170 Notes(4) protecting beings through the dharma, (5) not creating schisms among the servants and retinues of others, (6) giving all kinds of clothes, (7) giving lavish foods and drinks, (8) fully embracing the buddhadharma, (9) keeping secret words secret and relinquish­ing sexual intercourse, (10) progressively engaging in vast virtuous actions, (11) per­fectly accomplishing virtuous dharmas, (12) comforting others due to being fearless, (13) being enthusiastic about everything to be done for others, (14) insatiably practic­ing the path of the ten virtuous actions, (15) giving all kinds of medicine to the sick, (16) training in virtue in a pure manner, (17) training in having an equal mind toward all beings, (18) reconciling people who have disharmonies, (19) giving pleasing jewels, (20) greatly guarding their physical, verbal, and mental actions, (21) guarding words of truth, being firm in limitless merit, and giving supreme tastes, (22) speaking gentle words to beings, controlling their own words, and proclaiming words that delight all, (23) being endowed with love and guarding everyone, (24) having a motivation that is without deception, (25) praising those worthy of praise, (26) respecting and bowing to the gurus, (27) having a workable mind that perfectly courses in the dharma, (28) giving pleasing clothes, beddings, and seats, (29) completely avoiding hustle and busde and accepting the words of preceptors, masters, and spiritual friends as they spoke them, (30) possessing loving-kindness for all that lives and abandoning stones, sticks, and weapons, (31) training themselves and others in samadhi, and (32) making buddha statues, repairing dilapidated stupas, comforting others who are afraid, and reconciling those who are in disharmony. As mentioned before, the numerical breakdown of the marks into thirty-two in verses 111.17-25 is far from being obvious, and RYCs quote from the Ratnaddrikasutra actually lists thirty-four marks and their causes, taking “the tongues being long and tasting the supreme of tastes” as two marks and “his body hairs’ being subtle and soft, each one pointing upward from the body and curling to the right” also as two marks. The number thirty-two as inserted in the verses above is arrived at by following GC’s presentation of these marks and their causes, which is identical to the one in RYC except for counting each of the above two passages as one mark. Other commentaries, such as JKC (174-78), show different numberings and also sometimes varying causes. JKC says that in the list of the Uttaratantra, mark (8) “the body’s being tall and straight” in the list of the Abhisamaydlamkdra is implicitly taken as the general support of the actual thirty-two marks, while each of the following three pairs of marks in the Abhisamaydlamkdra are counted as a single mark—“the feet being well placed” and “being marked with wheels,” “having broad heels” and “having nonprotruding ankles,” and “the body hairs’ being subtle and soft” and “each one pointing upward from the body and curling to the right” (in addition, JKC subsumes the Uttaratantrds “possessing the strength of Narayana and being firm,” which is absent in the Abhisa­maydlamkdra, under “ being well proportioned like a perfect nyagrodha tree”). It may be asked then what the point is in summarizing these marks into thirty-two. JKC an­swers that not only these thirty-six marks but also the eighty minor marks are qualities of maturation. In addition, the entirety of all the maturational results of having gath­ered the accumulations on the paths of training are qualities of maturation. Here, it is from the perspective of summarizing them into their main categories that they are counted as the thirty-two qualities of freedom in terms of the results of meditative equipoise (the accumulation of wisdom) and the thirty-two qualities of maturation in terms of the results of subsequent attainment (the accumulation of merit). Thus, the definite number of sixty-four qualities is only given as a rough count.2282. In accordance with the above, RGW speaks of four sets of qualities (powers, fear­lessnesses, unique qualities, and major marks)."},{"pageNumber":1187,"pageContent":"Notes 11712283.

It may be said, “There is no object for the enlightened activity of awakening to engage because sentient beings are by nature afflicted, similar to the activity of digging for gold not engaging anything if there is no gold.” This is not the case—since awakening exists in sentient beings too without any difference, it is what enlightened activity engages. “But if awakening exists in them without difference, en­lightened activity does not need to engage it.” This is not the case either—since it is obscured by adventitious afflictions, just as the sky is by clouds, these must be dispelled. “Enlightened activity does not have the power to dispel them.” It does have that power because it entails great compassion.2289.1 follow Ut (D) and R G W (D) mdzad mi chad against RGW (P).2290.

In addition, the phrase phan tshun Itos pa med pa’i rgyur bsgrub pa appears in CMW in reverse order with phrase (3) (the same reverse order is found in CMW’s correlation of these two phrases with the verses in the text below). However, as will be seen, the order as presented here accords with the top­ics of the verses of the Uttaratantra and CMW’s reference to RGW in the text below.2307.

Despite speaking of “two disputes,” CMW only describes the first one among the two disputes and the answer to the second one (they are the same two disputes that were already mentioned two times above). Thus, two passages in “[ ]” about the second dis­pute and the answer to the first one are inserted here and right below in the text in ac­cordance with how the second dispute was already described in CMW and how CMW presents the answer to the second dispute below in the text (however, any additional comments on IV.92-93 that CMW may have contained are lost). This reconstruction also accords with RGVVs presenting the answer to its corresponding question “Why are the buddha bhagavans ... ?” as the three verses IV.89-91/92-94.2319.

These three verses or a passage something similar to them are not found in the Kangyur version of the Aksayamatinirdesasutra. The sutra contains a passage about the accumulation of merit of bodhisattvas being inexhaustible (D175, fol. 151a.6-153a.l), which starts with the merits arising from generosity, discipline, and meditation, and sometimes seems to echo some parts of these verses, but does not contain a comparison of generosity, discipline, and dhyana with “having faith in this dharma.”2328.

YDC (406) adds that the prajnaparamita sutras speak of four such causes—being obscured by maras, lacking faith in the profound dharma, clinging to the skandhas and so on, and associating with evil friends. According to Mahdydnasutralamkara 1.8 and its commentaries, the four causes of being afraid of the mahayana are lacking the bodhisattva disposition, asso­ciating with bad spiritual friends of the sravakayana and the pratyekabuddhayana, not having accumulated virtue in former lifetimes that leads to the understanding of the mahayana, and not having trained ones mind through studying and reflecting on the mahayana in both former lifetimes and this one."},{"pageNumber":1189,"pageContent":"Notes 11732334. Ajatasatru ruled the kingdom of Magadha in northern India c. 491-c. 461 bce. He was the son of King Bimbisara, a great patron of the Buddha.

Their mother is said to have made aspiration prayers to give birth to sons who would uphold the Buddhist teachings. However, contrary to common Tibetan tradition, Taranatha ex­plicitly says that she was not a nun who had relinquished her vows to give birth to these sons. Paramartha’s (499-569) Chinese biography of Vasubandhu says that the mothers name was Virinci and that both Asanga’s and Vasubandhu’s father was a Brahman, with whom she also had a third son, called Virincivatsa.2346. According to Taranatha (1980, 158-59), there are different accounts on how much time Asanga spent in Tusita—six months, fifteen years, twenty-five years, or fifty years.2347.

There is no known commentary on that text by Vasubandhu, but HLS probably refers to theSatasahasrikdpancavimfatisdhasrikdstddasasdhasrikdprajndpdramitdbrhattlkd (a commentary on the three longest prajhaparamita sutras), which is often attributed to Vasubandhu.

According to Dpa’ bo gtsug lag phreng ba (2003, 972) and Chos kyi ’byung gnas (Situpa VIII) and ’Be lo tshe dbang kun khyab (2005, 1:580), Karma Gonshon just met the Third Karmapa (without receiving teachings) and was primarily a disciple of the Fourth Karmapa, Rolpe Dorje (1340-1383). He studied the yana of characteristics at Sangpu and became renowned as a great scholar. It was primarily with him that the Sakya scholars Yagton (1350-1414) and Rongton (1367-1449) studied the last two Maitreya works (Dharma- dharmatavibhdga and Uttaratantra). Stearns (2010, 58) also mentions a debate between Karma Gonshon and Rendawa Shonnu Lodro (1348-1412) on the question of internal contradictions in the Kdlacakratantra.2355. That is, Dolpopa.2356. This refers to ’Bri gung chos kyi rgyal po (1335-1407), a student of the Fourth Kar­mapa, who served as the eleventh abbot of the major Drikung Kagyii monastery Dri- kung Til (Tib. ’Bri gung mthil) from 1351-1395.2357. The translation of the verses of the Uttaratantra in HLS is the same as in CMW, following Ut (D) and RGW (DP). Therefore, the numerous misspellings and slight variants in HLS, which usually follow the version of the verses in RGW (P) are not listed. Also, for reasons of space, I mostly do not retain the verses to which HLS assigns only headings but does not comment on. In such cases, I list only the numbers of these verses in the Tibetan versions of the Uttaratantra (for their contents, refer to CMW).2358. Dhdranisvarardjasutra, D147, fol. 142a.4-5.2359.

As mentioned before, these two sets of qualities represent the two categories under which many Tibetan commentaries subsume what they count as the six qualities of the jewel of the samgha in Uttaratantra 1.13-18. The qualities of awareness are (1) the wisdom of suchness, (2) the wisdom of variety, and (3) wisdom’s being internal. The qualities of liberation are (4)—(5) being pure of both afflictive and cognitive obscura­tions and (6) being unsurpassable. HLS clearly follows this model up through identify­ing (4)-(5) as the qualities of liberation, while it seems that (6) being unsurpassable is not included in either category.2371. HLS omits this verse.2372. An interlinear note here says that this refers to the twelve branches of the Buddha’s speech, such as the sutra collection and proclamations in song.2373.

Given the context, the translation of the second clause beginning with “because” (which on its own is difficult to construe in both RGVV (DP) and HLS) follows the Sanskrit of RGVV.2377. Like some other Tibetan commentaries, HLS omits Uttaratantra 1.27, but I retain the numbering of the following verses for the sake of concordance.2378.

This group of sentient beings as well as the two following ones are described in RGVV (J10).2382. HLS omits this phrase.2383.

That is, the purity of the dharmakaya, the attainment of buddha wisdom, and great compassion engaging all beings.2386. HLS gro/ ba emended to drod.2387. In HLS, the entire passage from here up through the sentence that ends “because they have relinquished such mistakenness” in the comments on 1.46 is mistakenly placed on 167-68.

Though there is a similar passage in the Anunatvapurnatvanirdesasutra (Taisho 668, 467a), as it stands, this quote is from the ¿rimalddevisutra (D45.48, fol. 272a.7-272b.l).2401.

Madhyantavibhagabhasya, D4027, fols. 9b.2-10a.2. According to Mipham Rin- poches commentary on the Madhyantavibhaga (’Jii mi pham rgya mtsho 1984e, 693- 97), in the nature of the dharmadhatu (the object to be realized), there are no different types. Still, in the subject that realizes this dharmadhatu (the meditative equipoises of the ten bhumis), there are differences in terms of its increasingly pure seeing of the dharmadhatu, though there is no difference in these meditative equipoises in terms of the manner in which dualistic appearances vanish within the dharmadhatu free from reference points. Therefore, just as one is not able to distinguish the traces of a bird in space, one cannot distinguish the bhumis from the perspective of meditative equi­poise. When bodhisattvas progress from bhumi to bhumi, the corresponding factors"},{"pageNumber":1193,"pageContent":"Notes il 77to be relinquished are relinquished through the particular wisdoms of the meditative equipoises of the respective bhümis. Through the power of that, particular kinds of certainty about the dharmadhâtu arise during subsequent attainment. Thus, the man­ner in which the factors to be relinquished are relinquished is explained here from the point of view of the aspects of those certainties. (1) When the dharmadhâtu has been seen directly in the meditative equipoise of the first bhümi, during its subsequent attainment, there arises the realization that the dharmadhâtu has the nature of being all-pervading and omnipresent. In this way, the meditative equipoise of the first bhùmi is that which induces this subsequent certainty because the latter is attained based on the former. Or one could say that bodhisattvas realize that the dharmadhâtu entails the actuality of omnipresence. Consequently, the obstacle for not realizing this actuality of the omnipresence of the dharmadhâtu is the obscuration of this bhúmi. Since this ob­scuration is relinquished through the arising of the wisdom of the first bhûmi, that cer­tainty during subsequent attainment arises automatically. This is also the case because all phenomena have become of the nature of the dharmadhâtu when the dharmadhâtu is seen directly, and therefore the nature of phenomena that is the equality of oneself and others is attained. The same goes for the remaining bhümis. (2) The wisdom of the second bhùmi consists of the actuality of the further eminence, or the supreme in­crease, of the realization of the dharmadhâtu. This means that bodhisattvas who have attained this wisdom practice purification through even greater efforts than before. (3) On the third bhùmi, bodhisattvas realize that studying the words of the Buddha—the natural outflow of the dharmadhâtu—is the supreme purpose to be striven for. Thus, for the sake of a single verse of dharma, they even cross a pit that is filled by a fire the size of a trichiliocosm. They do so because they see that the dharmadhâtu is the most significant and supremely undeceiving one among all objects to be realized, and that there is no superior cause for its realization than to study the words of Buddha. (4) On the fourth bhümi, bodhisattvas realize the actuality of nonclinging (such as clinging to any phenomena as being what is “mine”)—they even put an end to craving for the dharma, let alone any clinging to what is not the dharma. (5) On the fifth bhümi, they realize the actuality that the phenomena included in their own mind streams and those of others are not different. They also see that their own mind streams are not different from the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times. Furthermore, the sutras describe this as the ten equalities of completely pure mind and intention: (a)-(c) the equality of past, present, and future buddhas in their intentions with respect to the completely pure dharma, (d) the equality of intention with respect to completely pure discipline, (e) completely pure sentient beings, (f) completely pure elimination of views, doubts, and regrets, (g) completely pure knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path, (h) completely pure knowledge of the path, (i) completely pure increasing application of the dharmas concordant with awakening, and (j) completely pure maturation of sentient beings. Through these equalities, bodhisattvas realize that the dharmakáya of all buddhas is not different from their own mind stream (note that, according to the Dasabhümikasütra, the ten equalities are the equality of all phenomena in (1) their lack of defining characteristics, (2) their lack of characteristics, (3) their nonarising from the four extremes, (4) their nonarising, (5) their being void, (6) their primordial purity, (7) their lack of reference points, (8) their lack of being adopted or rejected, (9) phenomena’s being like dreams, optical illusions, water moons, reflections, and mag­ical creations, and (10) their being entities or nonentities). (6) On the sixth bhùmi, bodhisattvas see the actuality of profound dependent origination. Therefore, this is the realization that there is no phenomenon that is first afflicted and later becomes pure."},{"pageNumber":1194,"pageContent":"1178 Notes(7) On the seventh bhümi, through realizing signlessness, they realize the actuality of all phenomena’s having the single taste of not being different. (8) On the eighth bhümi, through attaining the poised readiness for nonarising, they realize the actuality of all phenomena’s existing as equality, in which there is neither decrease nor increase. In general, through the wisdoms of the three pure bhümis, bodhisattvas realize the dhar­madhàtu as the matrix of the fourfold mastery over the nonconceptual dharmadhàtu, pure realms, wisdom, and enlightened activity. On the eighth bhümi, they attain mas­tery over nonconceptuality because they lack any reference points and characteristics by virtue of resting in meditative equipoise in the dharmadhàtu in the manner of one taste. They also attain mastery over pure realms because there appear, and they display, limitless appearances of buddha realms and mandalas of retinues. (9) On the ninth bhümi, they attain mastery over the wisdom of teaching the dharma through the four types of discriminating awareness. (10) During the subsequent attainment of the tenth bhümi, bodhisattvas attain mastery over enlightened activity happening in exactly the way they wish. In this manner, the wisdoms of the meditative equipoises of the last three bhümis are the cause or matrix of those masteries. Since this is the case through the power of bodhisattvas focusing on the dharmadhàtu, the dharmadhàtu should be understood as the actual matrix in which those qualities arise. Bodhisattvas are able to ascertain this through seeing it directly, whereas ordinary beings should understand it through inference. It is true that there is some degree of simply inducing certainty about the dharmadhàtu’s being omnipresent, without decrease and increase, and so on, even on the level of engagement through aspiration. However, during the subse­quent attainments of having directly encountered the pure dharmadhàtu through the wisdoms of the respective bhümis, bodhisattvas attain the effortless certainty that cuts through superimpositions through the power of their experience. This is to be under­stood as the increasingly pure special seeing of the nature of the dharmadhàtu that consists of the phases of progressing from bhümi to bhümi. Thus, the ignorance that obscures seeing the nature of the dharmadhàtu as it is bears the names “great dullness” or “cognitive obscurations.” For its nature consists of the ten obscurations that are not afflictions, while the ten bhümis represent the remedies for the antagonistic factors of the wisdoms of these ten bhümis. That is, through attaining the respective bhümis, these obscurations are relinquished for good. See also Brunnholzl 2010, 519-21 on “the distinctive features of realization.”2424.

This refers to the ongoing Tibetan debate about the order of the five Maitreya texts and which one of them is the final one. YDC (409) presents the standard argument that among these five, the Abhisamaydlamkdra is the first one since it is the only one that starts with verses of paying homage and committing to compose the treatise, while the Uttaratantra is the last one because it is the only one that ends with a verse of dedica­tion (the remaining three texts have no such verses)."},{"pageNumber":1195,"pageContent":"Notes 11792432.

Compare Uttaratantra 1.55-63 on the way in which the universe is formed in space through the elements as an example for how mistakenness and its results arise within the purity of the mind. In this example, improper mental engagement is like the wind element, which gives rise to afflictions and karma as well as the skandhas (which re­semble the elements of water and earth, respectively). Just as the elements in space, improper mental engagement, afflictions, karma, and the skandhas arise and cease within the purity of mind, which is unchanging and never afflicted by these adventi­tious stains.2448.

However, the nature of thoughts is mistakenness in terms of both having and not having a basis—thoughts are mistaken through taking the self- arisen wisdom that is beyond thought and expression as their object.2536.

This example is found in the Dasabhumikasutra. A newborn prince is already supe­rior to all the king’s ministers inasmuch as he is born into a royal family. However, in terms of his own mental power while still a child, he is not superior to the ministers. Finally, when he has grown up and received the best possible education, he surpasses the king’s ministers in all respects. Likewise, once bodhisattvas have truly generated bodhicitta, they are superior to sravakas and pratyekabuddhas in terms of their mo­tivation but not their mental power. On the seventh bhumi, by virtue of their great wisdom, they surpass sravakas and pratyekabuddhas in all respects.2540. RW mnyam emended to snyam.2541.

They should familiarize with the notion of nonreferentiality since all phenomena are naturally lu­minous. They should familiarize with the notion of not being attached to anything since all entities are impermanent. If the mind is realized, it is wisdom. They should familiarize with the notion of not searching buddhahood elsewhere since the mind, if realized, is wisdom.’”2566. This paragraph as well as all headings in the text are inserted by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, the editor of the Lamp in the Rumtek book edition.2567. Note that most of the comments in the notes are based on Khenchen Tsiiltrim Gyatso Rinpoches explanations on the Lamp. Here, “the expanse” refers to the inseparability of mind’s infinite expanse and awareness (Tib. dbyings rig dbyer med). Just as in classical Madhyamaka, Shentong accepts the emptiness of all phenomena of seeming reality. As for ultimate reality, its basic nature is also emptiness free from all reference points, but the final ultimate is that inseparability of expanse and awareness. In Shentong, the ultimate reality realized by yogic practitioners can only be this unity of minds ex­panse and awareness. For, if it were nothing but emptiness, it would be the extreme of extinction or nihilism. The sheer freedom from reference points of, for example, the *Prasangika School, is not considered to be ultimate reality, but just the ultimate nonstatement (see more below). As for “the secret of the secret,” “the secret” is Great Madhyamaka, which is secret in the sense of being difficult to realize by ordinary dual- istic minds. “The secret of the secret” is its being realized through the inner experience of yogic practitioners. Thus, “the secret of the secret” is the final ultimate reality as experienced in an incontrovertible manner by nonconceptual and nondual personally experienced wisdom. The meaning of the expanse’s being “unmixed with any specific or general characteristics” is that all phenomena of seeming reality arise from clinging to specific and general characteristics, but ultimate reality neither arises in this way nor is it tainted by such clinging. “The adventitious mind” is the mind of ordinary beings, which works in a dualistic fashion, creates concepts, and works by way of reasoning. Thus, the awareness of minds true expanse cannot be any dualistic form of cognition, but refers to the direct realization that arises from yogic practice, that is, resting in non- dualistic and nonconceptual meditative equipoise. This is “the vajra of the wisdom of yoga.” Dpal Idan rang byung phrin las kun khyab bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan (n.d., 37-38) comments on these lines that the basic nature of inseparable emptiness and lucidity, which is not connected to any specific or general characteristics, is greatly more secret than secret and cannot be realized as it is by Rangtongpas who cling to mere emptiness in the sense of a nonimplicative negation. This nature is secret in general because it cannot be fathomed by dualistic clinging. It is greatly secret because it is not the sphere of dialecticians who cling to just the aspect of an emptiness in the sense of a nonim­plicative negation. Those who realize it properly as it is are the yogins who cut through all doubts through making one-pointed efforts in the pith instructions on minds true actuality and do so by connecting with the pith instructions of a genuine guru. Though the progressive stages of emptiness that are related to the way of being of identity­lessness are profound objects, given that the inconceivable secret basic nature that is the very final definitive meaning exists, they cannot be realized clearly through merely clinging to a path that is a limited emptiness."},{"pageNumber":1201,"pageContent":"Notes 11852568. The imagery here is based on the Indian epithets for the moon. The Buddha is like the clear moon and his teachings are like its cooling light rays (cooling the torment­ing heat of the mental afflictions, which is like the unbearable heat of Indian summer days). In India, what we usually call “the man in the moon” appears like the shape of a rabbit or an antelope, whose fine lines stand for Maitreya (aka Ajita, “the invincible one”) as the illuminator of the true meaning of the Buddha’s teachings. Asafiga, as the primary recipient of Maitreya’s teachings, is compared to the ocean in which the moon (with the image of the antelope in it) is reflected. Just as moonlight dances on the waves of the vast ocean, producing all kinds of light displays, the mahäyäna teachings mani­fest in many wonderful ways through Asafiga’s vast expositions.2569. Traditionally, the children of the Buddhas mind are said to be the bodhisattvas. The children of his speech are the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, and the child of his body is his physical son Rähula.2570. The seemingly most obvious referent of mal ’byor spyod pa’i sa (yogäcärabhümi) here is the text by this name that is attributed to Asafiga but the Lamp does not specif­ically rely on teachings in that text. Rather, according to Äcärya Sherab Gyaltsen Negi, here, this expression refers to the realization during the meditative equipoise of bodhi­sattvas from the first bhümi onward, which indicates that the Eighth Karmapa wrote this text from the perspective of the direct realization of ultimate reality.2571. These three headings represent the three reasons for all sentient beings’ possessing buddha nature as given in Uttaratantra 1.28.2572. Parts of the Tibetan tradition, such as Sakya Pandita in his Tshad ma rigsgter (Sa skya pandita kun dga’ rgyal mtshan 1992a, 328) and Gorampa’s commentary on it (Go bo rab ’byams pa bsod nams seng ge 1979a, 3:281), sometimes present a threefold division of awareness (rigpa): (1) awareness of something other (gzhan rig), (2) self-awareness (rang rig), and (3) awareness of the lack of nature (rang bzhin med par rig pa). The first means that mind is aware of something that seems to be other than itself, such as outer material objects (sense perception and mental perception). The second refers to mind’s being aware of itself in a nondual way, that is, without any identifiable dif­ference between mind as the perceiving subject and mind as the perceived object. The third is the direct realization of the true nature of all phenomena, that is, that they are without any nature. Obviously, (1) pertains only to ordinary beings. Awareness (2) is found in both ordinary beings and noble ones (those who directly perceive the nature of phenomena) in a general sense, though the profundity of nondual experience differs. Awareness (3) occurs only in noble beings from the path of seeing onward. It is also called “the wisdom that realizes identitylessness,” “yogic valid perception,” or “person­ally experienced wisdom” (Skt. pratyätmavcdaniyajnäna, Tib. so so rang rig pa’i ye shes). The latter term emphasizes that this wisdom is one’s own unique, immediate, and vivid experience, not just some imagined idea of something one has heard or read of. Mind’s realizing the nature of all phenomena includes mind’s being aware of its own ultimate nature, which is the unity of awareness and emptiness. The nature of such a realization is to be free from the triad of something that is aware, something of which it is aware, and the act of being aware, while at the same time being an incontrovertible transfor­mative experience in the noble ones’ own minds (Skt. pratyätmäryajnäna, Tib. ‘phags pa’i so so ranggi ye shes). The difference between (2) and (3) is reflected in the rather specific Buddhist use of the Sanskrit words svasamvid, svasamvedana, and svasamvitti (all translated into Tibetan as rang rig) for (2), while pratyätmagati, pratyätmädhigama, pratyätmavid, and the latter’s derivatives, such as pratyätmavedya and pratyätmave- daniya (all translated into Tibetan as so so rang rig) are used for (3). More literally,"},{"pageNumber":1202,"pageContent":"ii86 Notespratyatmavedaniyajndna means “the wisdom of what is to be experienced or realized personally or by oneself (that is, the nature of phenomena).” Of course, there is some overlap in the semantic range of these two groups of words, and, as the examples of Jnanasrlmitra and two of the Karmapas in the text below show, the words in the first one may also sometimes be used in the second sense. However, the emphasis in the latter group is clearly on one’s own firsthand knowledge or experience of something, be it identitylessness, emptiness, or the union of dharmadhatu and awareness (the nature of one’s mind). As for the corresponding Tibetan expressions rang rig and so so rang rig, in themselves, they do not mirror this distinction and are often taken to mean just the same. If the Tibetan tradition gives a distinct explanation of the meaning of so so in so so rang rig pa’i ye shes, this is usually done in two ways. First, in the explanation usually preferred by adherents of Shentong, so so refers to the fact that the final un­mediated realization of the nature of our mind can be accomplished only by this very mind’s wisdom and not by anything extrinsic to it, such as a teacher’s instructions or blessings. In other words, the only way to really personally know what the wisdom of a buddha or bodhisattva is like is to experience it in our own mind. In this sense, such wisdom is truly inconceivable and incommunicable, which is part of what the term “personally experienced wisdom” indicates, since it is one’s very own “private” experi­ence unshared with others. Of course, in this context, it should be clear that “personal” or “private” does not refer to an individual person in the usual sense, since the wisdom of the noble ones encompasses the very realization that there is no such person or self. Nevertheless, it is an experience that occurs only in distinct mind streams that have been trained in certain ways, while it does not happen in others. The second explana­tion of so so, usually given by adherents of Rangtong, is that, just like a mirror, this wisdom clearly sees all phenomena in a distinct way without mixing them up. Certain Indian and Tibetan masters, such as JnanaSrimitra (one of Maitrlpa’s teachers), the Sev­enth Karmapa, and the Eighth Karmapa, use self-awareness and personally experienced awareness/wisdom as equivalents in the sense of this wisdom’s representing the most sublime expression of the principle that mind is able to be aware of itself in a nondual way, that is, free from any aspects of subject and object. Jnanasrlmitra’s Sakarasiddhi (in Jnanasrlmitra, Jndnasrimitranibandhavali, 478.10-13) says: “In Uttaratantra [1.9, we find] the words ‘the dharma is to be personally experienced.’ Since it has been said that false imagination exists, there is no refuge other than self-awareness (uttaratantre ca! pratyatmavedyo dharmah/ ity evdksaram/ na cabhutaparikalpo stiti bruvatah svasamvedanad anyac charanam).” Obviously, this kind of self-awareness that is a ref­uge is to be clearly distinguished from the ordinary notion of self-awareness (2), which basically means that all beings are aware of their own direct experiences, such as being happy or sad. The Seventh Karmapas Ocean of Texts on Reasoning (Chos grags rgya mtsho 1985, 2:163) first equates self-awareness and personal experience in a general way: “Perception (the subject [in question]) is established to be free from conception through self-aware perception itself, because it is experienced through self-awareness as a cognition that does not appear as being suitable or not being suitable to conflate terms and referents. For, every person’s conceptions that are based on apprehending names and referents as being suitable to be conflated are to be experienced personally by the experiencer that is self-awareness.” Later, the Karmapa (ibid., 2:338) also iden­tifies the personally experienced wisdom of a buddha’s omniscience as an instance of self-awareness: “It is not contradictory for awareness to be what it is aware of. For, when this awareness knows the minds of others, it must be aware of knowing itself, and the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects is [also] a personal experience of itself.” In this"},{"pageNumber":1203,"pageContent":"Notes 1187vein, the Eighth Karmapas Lamp says (19-20, 21, and 41): “The [cognizing] subject that is the type of realization that realizes this very [dharmakáya] does not depend on any other hosts of reference points, but is self-awareness by nature. Therefore, by virtue of this self-awarenesss being pure through its very [own] purity, it is not dependent on anything else,” and “the great Mâdhyamika, venerable Asañga, holds that [during the vajra-like samadhi] at the end of the path of familiarization, in this very mind stream that will become a buddha and in which tathàgatahood abides, remedial self-awareness dawns and thus everything to be relinquished [at this point] is relinquished without exception,” and “liberation is to have attained the mastery of self-aware wisdom over the sugata heart of one’s own mind stream.” In addition, the Lamp repeatedly identifies the realization of buddhahood as being self-awareness and self-arisen.2573. The phrase “wisdom rising from the expanse” is to be understood in the sense of luminosity’s power becoming manifest, which is due to the fact of this wisdom’s exist­ing primordially as not being different from the sugata heart. Thus, this wisdom does not newly arise, but in the same way that gold “arises” from gold ore—it is already present, but just becomes manifest and its excellent qualities become apparent. In this vein, “fundamental change” does not mean that one thing changes or transforms into another, but what is previously existent yet obscured becomes clearly manifest. In other words, mind’s basic nature is the inseparable unity of expanse and awareness free from reference points, but, within sentient beings, its aspect of awareness or luminosity is not manifest. Once the actuality of expanse and awareness being inseparable is realized, the aspect of mind’s intrinsic luminosity is clearly experienced. In the Mahâmudrâ tra­dition, this is described as letting the mind rest in its own nature in a naturally relaxed and uncontrived manner (rang babs su gnas pa). This is “the wisdom of realization” free from subject-object duality, in which there is neither anything to be realized nor any realizer. Thus, the Shentong tradition always emphasizes the fact that ultimate re­ality or the unity of expanse and awareness is realized only through the personally experienced wisdom in meditation. “The cognition that frees the minds of sentient beings from stains” refers to the prajñá arising from study, reflection, and meditation on the dharma. This prajñá influences the obscured mind just as knowing in a dream that one is dreaming influences the dreaming mind. “The element of wisdom” is the wisdom that abides as the primordial ground of the mind of all beings, which is like the mind that is the basis for having a dream. It is this wisdom that, blessed by the dhar­makáya or sugata heart of buddhas (compare section 2.1.3.4.), eventually becomes the wisdom that is endowed with both of the two purities (natural purity and the purity of its being free from all adventitious stains). This “wisdom of realization” is personally experienced wisdom. In other words, this prajñá and wisdom refer to “the unfolding disposition” and “the naturally abiding disposition,” respectively. In the Shentong view, these two are essentially identical in being mind’s luminous nature or the ultimate unity of expanse and awareness, with the unfolding disposition referring simply to this lu­minous mind’s being in the process of fully manifesting as it is. “The cognizance free from stains” refers to this stainless luminosity, just as pure gold within gold ore. If stainless gold were not present in the ore from the beginning, once all impurities are re­moved, there would be nothing left. In the same way, mind, which is stainless by nature, can go through a process of purification and thus “fundamentally change” from being obscured to being unobscured. This is the meaning of “the wisdom of realization’s becoming of one taste with the dharmakáya.” Compare the following passage in the Eighth Karmapas commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra (Brunnhôlzl 2011b, 179), which reads like a reformulation in slightly different terms of what his Lamp says here:"},{"pageNumber":1204,"pageContent":"ii88 Notes“Thus, with the pure mirrors of the mind streams of the beings to be guided serving as the remedial factors and through the power of the dependent origination within the facet of their minds that is the lucid and aware cognition which is close to the nature of genuine liberation and accords in its realization with the nature of phenomena, the obscurations of sentient beings are relinquished in dependence on the aspects of the rupakayas appearing in said facet of their minds by virtue of permanent liberation— the Tathagata—functioning as the dominant condition for such appearance.”2574. “Correct aspiration” for “the expanse of all tathágatas” refers to purifying the mind stream through studying, reflecting, and meditating. This is brought about by the pri­mary mind that is the sixth consciousness and its associated mental factors. Through this, beings remove many of the cloud-like obscurations from the tathagata heart, but such efforts can never create or bring in the sun of buddha nature. Nor does it need to be created or imported because it has always been there since beginningless time. This resembles the sun’s being right there once enough clouds have vanished. If the tathagata expanse did not exist primordially, beings on the path would have the tire­some task to newly produce it, which would make it a conditioned phenomenon that is impermanent—arising and also ceasing. Thus, aspiring for it as the incontrovertible state of buddhahood would be pointless. Finally, at the very end of the path of familiar­ization, during the last moment of the tenth bhümi, the vajra-like samadhi overcomes the last (and most deeply ingrained) traces of obscurations, which means that the lumi­nous wisdom aspect of mind overcomes the final vestige of beginningless ignorance in a single instant, just as sunlight overcomes the darkness in a cave under the earth right upon its shining into this cave, no matter how long that darkness existed in it. That this final realization does not even rely on the power of meditation means that it is not con­trived and is free from any notions of meditator, object of meditation, and meditating.2575. This can either refer to the three states of ordinary beings, bodhisattvas on the path, and buddhas (aka ground, path, and fruition) or, as explained in the text below, the states of the three jewels of buddha, dharma, and samgha.2576. The first two sentences in this section resemble Uttaratantra I.84ab, which equates the dharmakaya with the Tathagata, the reality of the noble ones, and ultimate nirvana. The all-pervasiveness of the dharmakaya is found in Uttaratantra I.49ff. as the space­like all-pervasiveness of “the stainless basic element that is the nature of the mind” and also in several other verses (such as 11.22-23 and 29). For example, in a dream, the mind pervades all the appearances in that dream, including empty space. Without this under­lying mind, there would not be any dream appearances simply appearing on their own. It is in this way that the dharmakaya is said to pervade all phenomena and manifest the rupakayas. Uttaratantra 1.45-83 discusses the changelessness of the dhátu throughout the three states of ordinary beings, bodhisattvas on the path, and buddhas. In the state of sentient beings, in itself, the sugata heart is pure by nature, but not purified of the adventitious stains. Thus, it is not yet the dharmakaya with twofold purity, but the wis­dom that abides as the ground. In other words, buddhahood is not just a state or quality of awakened beings, but is, in itself, the primordially and perfectly pure nature of the mind that is either hidden or manifest. It is in this sense that buddhas can be said to be awakened primordially. In this vein, since the tathagata heart is essentially the same as a tathagata, just as the latter, it embodies not only all buddha qualities and enlight­ened activities but also all three jewels (as described in Uttaratantra 1.4-22). Thus, the tathagata heart is also the actual source and the reliable basis of the blessings of taking refuge in the three jewels because these jewels are already present right now within us. Thus, ultimately, one’s own buddha nature is the sole genuine and inner refuge—to"},{"pageNumber":1205,"pageContent":"Notes 1189take refuge in external buddhas, their dharma teachings, and their samghas represents merely outer conditions that serve to reflect and point back to the buddhahood within. Likewise, it is only the progressively more obvious manifesting of the tathâgata heart on the path (aka “unfolding disposition”) through the elimination of the adventitious stains that appears as the seemingly new accumulations of merit and wisdom, while its full manifestation as the dharmakàya or self-arisen wisdom makes all its intrinsic qual­ities apparent (which are described in detail in the third chapter of the Uttaratantra).2577. From the Shentong point of view, all phenomena of samsâra and nirvâna are the mind’s own radiance or light (sems kyi rang 'od), just as the rays of the sun radiate from and are not possible without the sun or just as the appearances in a dream manifest in and are not possible without a mind that dreams. However, they are neither this very mind itself, nor anything else that really exists. “The actualization of the state of per­sonally experienced wisdom within the unsurpassable expanse of the tathâgata heart” refers again to mind resting in meditative equipoise in its own nature in an uncontrived manner. In other words, one does not really go anywhere in order to become a buddha, but rediscovers what the true nature of one’s mind has always been.2578. The intrinsic qualities of the sugata heart, such as omniscience, compassion, and the power to guide sentient beings, exist primordially. Therefore, for these qualities to become apparent, it is sufficient to remove the adventitious stains that obscure them. Once these are removed, the qualities shine forth and, within the experiential sphere of a tathâgata, the enlightened activity that is the natural outflow of these qualities manifests in a spontaneous, uninterrupted, and completely nonreferential manner for those who are to be guided to their own sugata hearts. As the Uttaratantra and its commentaries say, the true nature of the sugata heart in its entire inconceivability can be fathomed only by buddhas—even bodhisattvas on the tenth bhümi perceive only a resemblance of it.2579. As quoted in RG W (J5-6), the Dhâranïévararâjapariprcchâsütra (D147, fol. 215b.l- 7) matches the three turnings of the wheel of dharma with the example of the gradually refined cleansing of a precious stone and refers to the third wheel as “the wheel of irreversibility.”2580. That the sugata heart, its qualities, and its activities are permanent and enduring are recurring themes throughout the Uttaratantra and RGW . By contrast, scholars of the Gelugpa School and others usually assert buddha nature as being just another name for sheer emptiness and consider the buddha qualities and activities as belonging to seeming reality.2581. Here, an interlinear note (mchan bu) in the Tibetan editions says, “It is not the object of those Màdhyamikas who behave like Vaibhàéikas.” This refers to those Màdhyami- kas who, on the conventional level, assert outer objects different from mind, which is usually held by Tibetans to be the position of *Sautràntika-Svàtantrikas such as Bhâ- viveka. Tsongkhapa and his followers claim that even *Prâsangikas assert outer objects in this way, which is one among Tsongkhapas “eight difficult points of Madhyamaka.”2582. This section largely follows R G W on Uttaratantra 1.5-8 (J8; D4025, fol. 78a. 1-6). The three qualities mentioned in the heading of this section are being unconditioned, being effortless or spontaneously present, and not being realized through any other conditions (which are discussed in this and the next section). These three represent the first three of the six (or eight) qualities that make up buddhahood as described in Uttaratantra 1.4-8. The last sentence of this section presents the next three of these qualities—omniscient wisdom (knowing both one’s own welfare and that of oth­ers), compassion or loving-kindness, and power (skillfully guiding sentient beings in"},{"pageNumber":1206,"pageContent":"1190 Notespurifying their stains and realizing their sugata heart). As for unconditioned buddha- hood’s being realized by self-aware wisdom, though the former seems to be presented like the ultimate object and the latter like the ultimate subject, this is just a pedagogic manner of speaking. In actual fact, it is mind’s innate purity that purifies itself through realizing, and resting in, its true nature in a completely nondual and nonreferential way.2583. This is a slightly paraphrased and abbreviated quote from R G W on Uttaratantra 1.7 (J8; D4025, fol. 78a.4-5).2584. I could not locate this sentence in Vasubandhu’s Maháyanasütrdlamkárabhñsya. It seems to refer to the fact that, in the end, both pratyekabuddhas and perfect buddhas realize their respective state of awakening through the power of their very own insight and not through any external conditions. “What is to be mentally formed first by a buddha” refers to the realization that all contaminations (suffering and its causes) are terminated. The realization that they will never arise again follows suit.2585. In the vajrayána, it is said that it is impossible to attain full buddhahood without receiving empowerment and thereby entering the mind’s inseparable unity of expanse and awareness, which is the indestructible and immutable vajra of mind’s luminous nature. It is also said that this is what the sütras mean by saying that all buddhas bestow the empowerment of great light rays upon bodhisattvas at the end of the tenth bhümi. However, as the Lamp says, such empowerments are only means or contributing con­ditions, which simply serve to remove obscurations but do not produce the tathagata heart, just as removing dross from gold does not newly produce gold but only makes it apparent. In other words, buddhahood is not produced by anything or anybody, but, in essence, only becomes manifest through recognizing its primordially existent very nature, which is one and the same in all beings and buddhas alike.2586. This corresponds to Uttaratantra I.4cd and R G W on 1.4-8 (J8-9; D4025, fol. 78a.6-78b.2).2587. Just as other Shentongpas (such as Dolpopa and Jamgon Kongtrul Lodró Tayé), Mikyó Dorje does not consider the teachings of Maitreya as the sole source of the Shentong view, but adds Nágárjuna s collection of praises (such as the Dharmadhatu- stava) and tantric sources such as the Kdlacakrat antra. This is a crucial element in the Shentong view’s being regarded by many as the one that links the sütras to the tantras. However, there are also many Tibetan masters who favor the Rangtong view from the point of view of the sütras or philosophical analysis through study and reflection, while preferring the Shentong view from the point of view of the tantras or making mind’s nature a living experience through meditation.2588. These two qualities represent the first two of the six (or eight) qualities of the jewel of the dharma as described in Uttaratantra 1.9-12 and R G W ’s comments on it. The next four are the dharma’s being nonconceptual, pure, lucid, and a remedy (which are also taught in this and the following four sections).2589. This section is based on Uttaratantra 1.9. The phrase “tathágatahood is awareness in the manner of being aware of itself and abides as the nature of [utter mental] peace” is equivalent to “the inseparable unity of expanse and awareness resting in itself in a naturally relaxed and uncontrived manner (dbyings rig dbyer med rang babs su gnas pa).” “Utter mental peace” means freedom from all reference points, as indicated here by the four extremes of existence, nonexistence, and so on. Ultimately speaking, the realization of a buddha—yogic valid perception or personally experienced wisdom— is the only truly valid cognition. Compared with this, all nonconceptual perceptions and inferential cognitions of ordinary beings (including those based on Madhyamaka"},{"pageNumber":1207,"pageContent":"Notes 1191reasonings) cannot be valid, since they are always essentially dualistic and mistaken by virtue of their latent tendencies of ignorance. By contrast, Tsongkhapa and his follow­ers claim that it is nothing other than ultimate reality (which they take to be emptiness as a nonimplicative negation) that is realized through even an ordinary being’s correct inferential cognition based on Madhyamaka reasoning. Compare the Eighth Karmapa s commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkara that repeatedly says that the tathagata heart and the nondual nonconceptual wisdom in the meditative equipoise of buddhas and bodhisattvas on the bhumis are beyond being conceivable or analyzable as anything (such as the four extremes) by beings with dualistic minds (on this, see also the next section of the Lamp). For example, the Karmapa (Brunnholzl 2011b, 219) says that all seeming cognitions and their objects are magical creations by nothing but the states of mind that cling to characteristics. Since these states of mind obstruct the arising of the wisdom without characteristics, in all respects they are factors to be relinquished. Though these states of mind are relinquished, it is solely in the nondual wisdom that is the nature of ultimate reality that there is no clinging to extremes. For it is this very wis­dom that completely eradicates said extremes, but this wisdom has the nature of its be­ing impossible for it to entertain any views about extremes about itself, such as its being existent or nonexistent. On the other hand, it is equally impossible for any cognitions of those who possess a mind stream of clinging to extremes to cling to any extremes (such as existence and nonexistence) with regard to this wisdom. For if this wisdom is not even suitable to appear in the form of a mere object generality as an object of any cognitions that cling to extremes, it is certainly impossible for any cognitions of those who possess a mind stream of clinging to extremes to take this wisdom as their basis of analysis and then cling to it as existent, nonexistent, or anything else. For this reason, the reasoning of this really established nondual wisdom s lacking or being empty of a nature is not something that can be conceived. Thus, this is the manner in which both true reality and what appears as if it is false reality are free from extremes. If one rests in meditative equipoise in accordance with this manner of being just as it is, the seeds of all obscurations are eradicated. Furthermore, the Karmapa (Brunnholzl 2010, 493) says that when the nature of all imaginary and dependent phenomena is analyzed, their own nature is emptiness, just as in the example of a banana tree without pith. As for the perfect nature (the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects), in general, it cannot be analyzed, and no matter how it may be analyzed, it does not become empty of a nature of its own. For it never changes into anything else than this supreme kind of wisdom. In that vein, Mikyo Dorje (ibid., 505) continues that, in the final turning of the wheel, when something like the tathagata heart—which is introduced subsequent to having eliminated all reference points—is taught as the basis of emptiness, the minds of bodhisattvas are perfectly ready for such a teaching, without misunderstanding or reifying it. For, at this point, all reference points with regard to all phenomena and their true nature have already been cut through. Therefore, the Karmapa (Brunnholzl 2011b, 172-73) states that the position of the true proponents of Shentong is that the ultimate perfect nature, which has a nature, is the nature that actually fulfills this function. But when such is said, this nature is not nonempty either and the existence of this nature is not something that consists of, or is included in, reference points and characteristics. Therefore, it does not fall into any extremes of reference points. Since said existence abides ultimately, it is free from all extremes of permanence and extinction. To explain this nature as the nature of the nonexistence of entities entails an intention because it is taught as such from the perspective of people who entertain reference points and out of the concern that these people may become afraid of emptiness. From the perspective"},{"pageNumber":1208,"pageContent":"1192 Notesof the noble ones without reference points, the very same nature is explained as the nature that is the existence of an entity (which is the true intention behind the former explanation). Therefore, the explanation of the ultimate perfect nature as the nature of the nonexistence of entities is the expedient meaning and its explanation as the nature that is the existence of an entity is the definitive meaning.2590. The following is a paraphrase of the beginning of the comments of RG W on Ut­taratantra 1.12.2591. In this combination, “attachment and obstruction” are equivalents of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations, respectively (see also the last section on the jewel of the samgha below).2592. Here, Mikyo Dorje openly criticizes both *Prasangika and *Svatantrika Madhyamikas (represented by Candraklrti and Haribhadra, respectively) for claiming that ultimate re­ality is nothing but the emptiness that is the mere nonfinding of any phenomenon un­der analysis through Madhyamaka reasoning, which can be arrived at even by ordinary beings. Though it is true that Madhyamikas like Bhaviveka, Candraklrti, Haribhadra, and others take said nonfinding to be the ultimate, they do not say that this ultimate, just as it is, can be realized by ordinary beings or reasoning alone (as mentioned above, this is only the position of Tsongkhapa and his followers). Rather, they also agree that the ultimate is only an object of the personally experienced wisdom of the noble ones. In order to distinguish the conceptual ultimate arrived at through reasoning from the actual ultimate directly realized by nonconceptual wisdom, *Svatantrika Madhyamikas like Bhaviveka use the terms “nominal ultimate” (Skt. paryayaparamdrtha, Tib. rnam grangspa’i don dam) and “nonnominal ultimate” (Skt. aparyayaparamartha, Tib. rnam grangs mayin pa’i don dam), respectively. Also, Bhavivekas Prajnapradipamfdamadh- yamakavrtti (D3853, fol. 190a.5-190b.l) says, “Since [true reality] is without concep­tions, it is not discursive through reference points. Since it is not discursive through reference points, it is peace. Since it is peace, it is the sphere of nonconceptual wisdom. Since it is the sphere of nonconceptual wisdom, it is not known through anything else. Since words do not apply to what is not known through anything else [than this wis­dom], the very nature of true reality is completely beyond the superimpositions of words. Though it undoubtedly cannot be expressed, [Midamadhyamakakarika XVIII.9 on the above characteristics of true reality] is explained in order to teach the negation of any nature and any features of all entities. The ability to realize the nature of true reality will [eventually] arise from the superimpositions of those words that accord with the arising of nonconceptual wisdom in the manner of nonarising. Thus, true reality, which is to be experienced personally, is taught by way of such means.” Can- draklrtis Prasannapada (D3860, fol. 163b.4-6) states, “In the ultimate, these [phenom­ena of seeming reality] do not exist, because what can be expressed has been put to an end and what is the sphere of mind (citta) has been put to an end. Since the unarisen and unceasing nature of phenomena accords with nirvana, how could words or cog­nitions operate within the ultimate? The ultimate is not known by virtue of anything else—it is peace, what is to be personally experienced by the noble ones, and beyond all reference points” and (ibid., fol. 184a.3-4), “Once, through the power of personal realization ... stainless nondual wisdom has been manifested ... one will be liberated.” His Madhyamakavatarabhasya (D3862, fol. 255a.5-6) explains, “What is the ultimate of ordinary beings is merely the seeming of those noble ones whose experiential sphere entails appearances, [that is, during subsequent attainment]. What is the nature of this (emptiness) is the ultimate of these [noble ones]. The ultimate of the buddhas is this very nature. It is ultimate reality by virtue of its very undeceptiveness. Still, all"},{"pageNumber":1209,"pageContent":"Notes 1193of them have to personally experience it on their own.” All of this is very much in accord with what was explained by Asafiga and Mikyö Dorje so far. Also, Haribhadra states that, in terms of the subject, the only ultimate is a buddha’s wisdom—even the paths of seeing and familiarization are not the actual ultimate, let alone what ordinary beings cognize. His Abhisamayälamkärälokä (Wogihara ed., 23) declares: “The illu- sion-like nondual wisdom of a buddha bhagavan is the actual [prajfiäpäramitä]. By virtue of being concordant with attaining this, the scriptures (collections of words and sentences) and the paths that have the characteristics of seeing and so forth are also called “prajfiäpäramitä,” [but] this is nominal.” Compare the Eighth Karmapas above­quoted passages in his commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkdra on the tathägata heart and nondual nonconceptual wisdom s not being conceivable or analyzable as anything by beings with dualistic minds. Note that whenever Mikyö Dorje criticizes the use of reasoning in his Lamp, this does not mean that he suggests the complete abandonment of Madhyamaka reasoning and instead advocates a simplistic approach of philosoph­ical irrationalism or the rejection of one’s intelligence. Rather, he just points out the limited scope of reasoning (be it Madhyamaka or other), which will never suffice to realize mind’s true nature as it is. Nevertheless, for any Mädhyamika (including the Great Mädhyamikas), such reasoning is a necessary preliminary step toward direct re­alization. For it dismantles any clinging to reference points and characteristics, thus leading to the point at which one is able to let go of any grasping at anything and relax the mind in itself in a nondual and nonconceptual manner. At that point, all intrinsic awakened qualities of mind’s ultimate nature—the tathägata heart—manifest. In brief, the point is that Madhyamaka reasoning can serve as a preparation for mind’s true nature eventually manifesting clearly on its own but that such reasoning itself cannot make this nature manifest. More generally speaking, all Buddhist teachings (such as about the four realities of the noble ones, no self, all phenomena’s being nothing but appearances in the mind, and emptiness) that precede the teachings on buddha nature are just means to remove the dross-like adventitious stains from the pure gold of the tathägata heart, while the Shentong teachings essentially come down to announcing that there is indeed gold within the dross.2593. This refers to the typical Yogäcära triad of “mind (citta/sems),” “mentation (manas/ yid),” and “consciousness (vijndna/rnam shes)” as indicating the älaya-conscious- ness, the afflicted mind, and the remaining six consciousnesses. Shentongpas (such as Dölpopa, Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé, and Mikyö Dorje in his commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkdra) often speak of the “älaya-consciousness” versus the “älaya” or “älaya-wisdom” in the sense of the sugata heart. According to Khenchen Tsliltrim Gyatso Rinpoche, from a Shentong point of view, the problem with the position that Tibetans call “Mere Mentalism” (taking smallest moments of self-aware consciousness free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended to be ultimately existent) is that it fails to realize that, ultimately, the älaya and self-awareness are nothing but the lumi­nous nature of the mind. Naturally, any attempt to establish the älaya and self-aware­ness as really existing phenomena on the level of seeming reality cannot withstand Madhyamaka reasoning. In Mere Mentalism, self-awareness is the inward-facing aspect in each moment of consciousness (be it a sense consciousness, a thought, or an emo­tion) that experiences itself without being differentiable into an experiencer and what is experienced. Once the illusion of external objects is seen through, it is this self-aware­ness that realizes the absence of any subject-object duality and is itself free from such duality. This is called “the ultimate dependent,” which is equivalent to the perfect na­ture when understood as the dependent nature’s being empty of the imaginary nature."},{"pageNumber":1210,"pageContent":"1194 NotesThe self-awareness (in the sense of the personally experienced wisdom of the sugata heart) that is discussed in the Lamp and other Shentong texts operates on the level of ultimate reality alone and is never connected with afflictions or any states of mind of seeming reality, but is empty of both the imaginary and the dependent natures. Just as all phenomena depend on space for their existence and interactions, while space nei­ther depends on, nor is connected to, them, all seeming phenomena—the adventitious stains—operate within the infinite space of the inseparability of minds expanse and awareness, but this nature of the mind neither depends on, nor has any connection with, these stains. This is explained at length in Uttaratantra 1.52-63. Without excep­tion, the afflictions and the resulting karma and suffering of ordinary beings arise from “improper mental engagement,” that is, their fourfold mistakenness of taking what is impermanent to be permanent, what is suffering to be happiness, what is impure to be pure, and what lacks a self or identity to have a self or identity. From the perspective of the Uttaratantra and RGVV, even the opposites of these four (as realized by érâ- vakas and pratyekabuddhas) are not “proper mental engagement.” For, such proper mental engagement consists of “the power of yoga”—the nondual and nonconceptual meditative equipoise of realizing the four pàramitàs of supreme permanence, bliss, purity, and self, which are beyond any clinging to the above four mistakennesses and their opposites (for details on these four pàramitàs, see section 2.2.1. in the text below). Since such yoga entails the freedom from the duality of apprehender and apprehended, it lacks the fundamental ignorance of “improper mental engagement,” which is also known as “false imagination.”2594. Here, an interlinear note in the Tibetan editions says, “[However,] some present Mahâmudrâ followers in the [Land] of Snows assert that this profound actuality ap­pears even in ordinary beings.” As mentioned in the introduction, in many of his texts, Mikyo Dorje cautions against a simplistic understanding of Mahâmudrâ in general and Gampopa s approach to it in particular.2595. The Lamp emphasizes the point that the adventitious stains—as primordially not really existent illusions—do not arise in the first place and thus are free from ceasing. Thus, it is enough to fully realize just this nonexistence of what appears as adventitious stains in order to manifest the underlying true actuality—the sugata heart—that seems to be obscured by them. For example, a fire in a dream does not ever really arise and thus there is no question of its ceasing either. One may dream that it is produced by firewood and matches, that it burns all day, and finally is extinguished through water. In actual fact, it does not matter how long it seems to have lasted, nor is there any need to extinguish it, since there never really was a fire in the first place. It is in this sense that the adventitious stains are said to be without nature and without arising and ceasing. Thus, from the point of view of the adventitious stains themselves (as an object), there is nothing to be relinquished. However, while understanding this, what is to be relin­quished is the subjective taking of these unreal adventitious stains to be real.2596. Mikyo Dorje obviously considers it absolutely untenable to take the mere nonseeing of seeming reality as being the seeing of ultimate reality. Strictly speaking, Màdhyam- ikas do not assert this either, since that would just be putting forth another reference point. Nevertheless, the Karmapa here refuses to take the *Prâsangikas> stance of not asserting anything whatsoever as reflecting the assumed profundity of their approach, but merely as a means to avoid the issue of what the ultimate is altogether. In this vein, there are many who accuse the Màdhyamikas, and in particular the *Pràsangikas, of being dishonest in just refuting everybody elses position while never putting forth any position of their own that their opponents could address. On this point, Pawo Tsugla"},{"pageNumber":1211,"pageContent":"Notes 1195Trengwa’s commentary on the Bodhicaryâvatâra (Dpa* bo gtsug lag phreng ba n.d., 888) says, “[Some] consider merely not giving an answer as the ultimate actuality. This is certainly a case of giving those who understand the meaning of Madhyamaka a goodchance for a laugh Therefore, it is explained that when Mañjuárl asked Vimalakirtiabout the meaning of the actual, the genuine answer [in this case] was not to give an answer. However, when one naive being does not give an answer to the question of another one, how could these two cases ever be comparable? You should know the difference between a bodhisattva in his last existence who dwells under the bodhi tree and [someone like] Devadatta sitting under a nimba tree. If you think that these [cases] are comparable, then ask about ultimate [reality] in front of an ox and you will get the final answer that you wish for.” Thus, ultimately, from the point of view of the true nature of phenomena itself and for such highly realized beings as Mañjuári and Vima­lakirti who directly experience it in meditative equipoise, there is nothing that could be said about it, since its very essence is that all discursiveness and reference points have dissolved. Conventionally and from the perspective of beings who have not yet realized this ultimate nature, however, this does not mean that nothing can be said about the view and the methods that gradually lead to the direct realization of this nature as an incontrovertible experience. As Nàgàrjuna’s Mûlamadhyamakakàrikâ XXV.24 and the already-quoted passage from Bhàvivekas Prajnâpradîpa say, without relying on con­ventions, the ultimate cannot be taught and thus cannot be realized. Thus, the Madhya­maka message is to use fingers to point to the moon, but not to mistake the former for the latter. In his commentary on the Madhyamakâvatâra, Mikyô Dorje agrees with this (for details on his discussion of how, ultimately, Madhyamikas do not and cannot have a position, see Brunnhôlzl 2004, 218-30 and 346-51).2597. Though this passage up through here is not an explicit comment on Uttaratantra 1.154, it includes all the elements of this verse. The correspondences to lines I.154ab in terms of there being nothing to be removed nor anything to be added are obvious. The phrase “the ultimate is the object that is seen by the tathagatas—that which [truly] exists in just the way it is in actual reality” corresponds to line 1.154c. The phrases “the completely pure seeing of the tathagatas” and “having become lastingly free from the adventitious stains” correspond to line I.154d.2598. This passage corresponds greatly (often literally) to some parts of R G W on Ut­taratantra 1.12 (J12-13; D4025, fol. 81a.2 and 81b.4-6) on the last three of the six qual­ities of the jewel of the dharma.2599. Shentongpas agree with other Madhyamikas that all phenomena of seeming reality lack any nature of their own, thus being empty of themselves and free from all ref­erence points. However, they do not say that this being empty of all phenomena of seeming reality, in itself, is ultimate reality. Rather, the mind’s becoming free from all reference points is only the setting within which it can then rest in its very own lumi­nous nature in a nondualistic, nonreferential, and uncontrived manner. For example, one can establish through analysis and reasoning that the reflections in a mirror have no intrinsic nature of their own, do not have the nature of the mirror, and do not really exist in it. Thus, these reflections are empty of themselves, while the mirror is empty of these reflections, but does exist. To simplify, an exclusive Rangtong approach, as it is criticized here by Mikyô Dorje, would be limited to the one-sided realization that the reflections do not really exist and are empty but would not go on to acknowledge the existence of the mirror (the basis in which all these temporary reflections have ap­peared). In addition, instead of relaxing into the tathâgata heart, in this approach, one would be trapped by continuing to use reasoning even at the point of having realized"},{"pageNumber":1212,"pageContent":"1196 Notesthat all adventitious stains are completely unreal (which is an obscuration in itself). In the Shentong approach, it is the “mirror” of the nondual luminous nature of the mind free from all obscuring reference points that is “seen” by buddhas, and it is solely from this perspective of nonconceptual realization in the meditative equipoise of a bud­dha that it can (conventionally and subsequently) be said to be an “existent.” However, this is a completely different level of “existence” than the existence that is refuted by Madhyamaka reasoning (which is always a more or less subtle imputation or reference point). This is also the reason why many Shentongpas say that the sugata heart is be­yond, or cannot be attacked by, Madhyamaka reasoning and transcends the four ex­tremes of existence, nonexistence, and so on. Just as in other passages in the Lamp and the Eighth Karmapa’s explanations in his commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkdra, this emphasizes the experiential thrust of what shentong refers to, which is the most crucial distinction in any meaningful discussion of rangtong and shentong—that these notions apply to two different realms of experience and discussion. This is also one of the major points in Dólpopas original presentation of rangtong and shentong (often overlooked by later Shentongpas as well as their opponents), which uses this distinction in an epis- temological sense and not in an ontological or reifying manner. In one of his main works, The Ocean of Definitive Meaning (Tib. Nges don rgya mtsho), he makes the clear distinction between a “philosophical system” (Skt. siddhdnta, Tib. grub mtha/), which is based on certain explanations and arguments, and a “point of view” (Skt. darsana, Tib. Ita ba) in the sense of a more encompassing and experiential outlook. He understands the latter as not being primarily focused on, or limited to, what can be determined through scholarly analyses. Rather, all such intellectual approaches represent only a preliminary part of a worldview that is primarily grounded in direct meditative expe­riences and realizations (often in the context of advanced vajrayána practices). It is the entirety of this that Dolpopa calls “Great Madhyamaka” and Shentong—the outlook of noble beings who have directly realized how their minds and phenomena really are. In this sense, he clearly contrasts Shentong with ordinary Madhyamaka or Rangtong as a mere system of conceptual philosophical analysis. Consequently, on these two levels, the entire perspective of what ultimate reality or the nature of phenomena is, how it is perceived, and any style of discourse about this must be very different. As for the Lamps saying above that cause and result always abide inseparably in the sugata heart, it is just from the perspective of conventional expressions that the sugata heart is referred to as a “cause” and the dharmakaya as its “result.” For, the dharmakaya is nothing other than the very same sugata hearts finally being without adventitious stains. Consequently, Madhyamaka reasonings about its being impossible for the result to either exist or not exist at the time of the cause do not apply here, since these reasonings are always based on the principle of cause and result having to be two different entities at two different times. Thus, contrary to what many of its critics say, the Shentong view is not compara­ble to the view of the non-Buddhist Sámkhya School that the result—which is different from its cause—exists already at the time of that cause. As for the analogies of water, gold, and space, the Lamp uses them here in the same way as many Yogacara texts do, indicating the changelessness of the ultimate versus the adventitiousness of its stains (as mentioned before, Uttaratantra 1.30-31 speaks of a wish-fulfilling jewel instead of gold, which illustrates the power of the basic element, while water symbolizes the mois­ture of compassion).2600. As mentioned above, these two qualities represent the two categories under which many Tibetan commentaries subsume what they count as the six qualities of the jewel of the samgha in Uttaratantra 1.13-18. In the Lamps four sections on the jewel of"},{"pageNumber":1213,"pageContent":"Notes 1197the samgha, four among these six qualities (the wisdoms of suchness and variety as well as being pure of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations) are explained explicitly in accordance with RGVV. The remaining two qualities are included implicitly—wis­dom’s being internal is reflected in phrases such as “the noble ones’ realization of the tathagata heart in their own mind streams” and (according to Uttaratantra 1.14) the unsurpassable qualities of the bodhisattva samgha consist of the purity of the wisdoms of suchness and variety.2601. The phrase “the naturally luminous mind of ordinary beings will touch the tathagata heart” corresponds to the classical vajrayána expression of “mother and child luminos­ity meeting,” meaning that the experiences of mind’s luminosity through practicing the path finally merge with—or are realized to be one with—mind’s primordial and natural luminosity. The second sentence above corresponds not only to the famous passage “The mind is no-mind. The nature of the mind is luminosity” in the prajñápáramitá sütra in eight thousand lines (Vaidya ed., 3.18; D12, fol. 3a.3), but also to equating sen­tient beings with the obscurations or adventitious stains, which eventually dissolve within the vast expanse of mind’s true nature (see CMW and the quotations to that ef­fect from the commentaries on the Abhisamayálamkára by the Fifth Shamarpa and the Eighth Karmapa). As for nothing in samsara and nirvana being possible without mind’s luminous nature, this is illustrated by its being one and the same mind that has a dream and then awakens from that dream. The appearances in a dream are empty and have no nature of their own, but if their underlying nature—the dreaming mind—did not exist, there would be neither a dream nor any awakening from it. The term “adventitious” is explained here as not being produced by really existing causes and conditions and thus not being real in any way either, just as a fire in a dream.2602. Mikyo Dorje says here (as do many others) that the ultimate’s having no nature amounts to saying that it does not exist, which is the worst case of falling into the ex­treme of extinction that all Buddhist schools, including the *Prásañgikas, desperately attempt to avoid. Of course, the Mádhyamikas would reply that having no nature is not at all equivalent to being nonexistent, because having no nature means to be neither existent, nor nonexistent, nor both, nor neither. In fact, Rangtongpas counteraccuse the Shentongpa position that the sugata heart exists ultimately as representing the ex­treme of permanence. As explained before, the real problem here is that both sides are trying to explain, through words, concepts, reasonings, and examples, something that lies completely beyond words, concepts, reasonings, and examples. If one wonders why both spend so much time and effort on such explanations, for those who do not realize what lies beyond words, there is a great difference between simply saying or thinking nothing and using words and reasoning in order to arrive at what lies beyond them. Also, though such explanations may differ, or even appear to be contradictory, individ­ually, they may prove to be the most helpful approach for different people to point to, eventually making them realize what lies beyond these explanations.2603. Both the Rumtek book edition and the xylographic block print have rtogs instead of btags.2604. The “selfless self’ refers to the páramitá of the supreme self (which is beyond self and lack of self) in Uttaratantra 1.35 and 1.37 (see also in the text below under 2.2.1.).2605. This paragraph corresponds to the quote from the Srimdládevisütra (D45.48, fol. 275a.5-7) in RGW (J15; D4025, fol. 82a.6-82b.2) on the wisdoms of suchness and variety. The Uttaratantra presents its well-known nine examples of buddha nature and adventitious stains coexisting, such as a buddha statue in a decaying lotus and bees around honey. Nágárjuna’s Dharmadhatustava uses thirteen examples for the"},{"pageNumber":1214,"pageContent":"1198 Notesdharmadhâtu and adventitious stains coexisting, such as butter within milk and a lamp within a vase (for all these examples, see note 2639). According to Mahâyânasamgraha 1.45-46 (D4048, fol. 10b.3-5), the âlaya-consciousness and “the latent tendencies of lis­tening” (as the natural outflow of the dharmadhâtu) coexist like a mixture of milk and water. What is common to all these examples is that the dharmadhâtu and adventitious stains never contact or even mix. Just as clouds in the sky may obscure the sun, but never come even close to it (or golds pure nature is never altered by the surrounding dross in gold ore), the sugata heart and adventitious stains have not the slightest con­nection or interaction. Thus, ultimately, minds luminous nature is not realized or “pu­rified” through any activities within the realm of adventitious stains, such as reasoning, but only through naturally resting in its own nature. On the level of seeming reality, “purification” occurs through increasingly more subtle adventitious stains (aka the pra- jnàs of study, reflection, and meditation) counteracting coarser ones. Also, though the adventitious stains operate within the expanse of mind’s luminosity, they are neither created by it nor can they afflict it. This is the reason why the Eighth Karmapa’s discus­sion of the disposition in his commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra (see Brunnhôlzl 2010, 438-46) refutes at length that the three reasons in Uttaratantra 1.28 can prove that there is any connection between sentient beings and buddha nature in terms of the former having or being the latter.2606. For Shentongpas, the realization of one’s own sugata heart, just as it is, and the reali­zation that all other beings are also endowed with such a sugata heart are just two facets of the single inner wisdom of realizing mind’s luminous nature. This self-aware and personally experienced realization—mind resting in its own nature in a nondualistic manner—means to be aware of this very nature and its likewise being the nature of the minds of all other beings. As for “omniscience,” Buddhists have various descriptions of its extent, ranging from a buddhas literally knowing everything to knowing just what is necessary to liberate all kinds of sentient beings (for which knowing facts such as the total number of certain insects in the world would not be required) to the above more limited description. In a less radical way, the latter is sometimes also explained in terms of the full realization of mind’s true nature in both one’s own mind and those of others being what represents a buddhas own sphere of experience. Any aspect of seeming reality or the adventitious stains cannot be something that appears in, or is perceived by, a buddhas awakened mind. For, otherwise it would still be experiencing seeming re­ality or adventitious stains and thus not be fully awakened. Thus, all aspects of seeming reality or the adventitious stains are solely the sphere of experience of others. In order to address the obvious question how, in this case, a buddha can skillfully relate to the distinct patterns of ignorance in various sentient beings, it is said that a buddha sees everything that happens within the expanse of the minds of these beings, but whatever is seen in these minds is not that buddha’s own sphere of experience. This may be compared to seeing a war in another country on a TV screen and thus being able to, for example, donate food and medical treatment to the victims of this war, but whatever one sees on the screen is not something that is one’s own experience or one’s own suffer­ing. Compare the following excerpts from the Eighth Karmapa’s detailed discussion of this issue in his commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra (Brunnhôlzl 201 lb, 289-93): “Asanga, Dignâga, and others hold that all consciousnesses of dualistic appearances ap­pear under the sway of ignorance and thus do not appear to buddha wisdom—wisdomonly perceives the ultimate Also, if dualistic appearances still emerge after the latenttendencies of the mistakenness of dualistic appearances have been eradicated, it fol­lows that the minds of buddhas are not stable in terms of relinquishment. For example,"},{"pageNumber":1215,"pageContent":"Notes 1199if strands of falling hair continue to appear after the disease of blurred vision has been cured, it is very difficult to speak of this disease having been removed.... Also, deceiving referents do not appear to valid perception. If they did, it would follow that the cognition of a buddha is just seeming valid perception___In brief, though seeming reality does not appear for buddhas, this is not contradic­tory to their cognizing all cognizable objects. Their cognition is one that truly fulfills this function because it distinctly cognizes, without mixing them, both the mistaken and unmistaken manners of the actual way of being and the way of appearing of the seeming. Still, what is assessed through a buddha’s cognizing the way of appearing ofthe seeming is nothing other than this buddha s very own self-awareness [Buddhas]solely cognize the nature of ultimate reality, that is, the perfect nature—the true end free from meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment___... In general, since all aspects of the seeming are unreal, from the perspective of the yoga of yogins who are engaged in what is truly real there is absolutely no seeing of anything as being mistaken and, in particular, there are absolutely no external enti­ties. Therefore, if what does not exist at the time of being a sentient being appears as existent at the time of being a buddha, what could be more unreasonable than that? ... In brief, within the scope of what appears to others, a buddhas mere cognizing the appearances of the seeming is justified, but it is not the case that these appearances are cognized by way of appearing as direct objects for buddha wisdom.... For this wisdom cognizes object generalities and so on in the manner of their being appearances for others, just as a wakening consciousness, at its own time, realizes the way of appearing of objects in a dream.”2607. See RGW (J22; D4025, fols. 86a.5-87a.6).2608. The sugata heart exists as the very foundation (the disposition) for the path to lib­eration, that path itself (nonconceptual personally experienced wisdom), and the fruition of that path (the dharmakâya). “To exist ultimately” means again not in the usual sense of existence within the tetralemma of existence, nonexistence, both, and neither, but to exist from the perspective of a buddhas valid cognition, that is, in a manner that is free from all reference points. If there were no buddha nature that can be realized as buddhahood, the teachings of the Buddha in general would be pointless and, in particular, his teachings in the final turning of the wheel of dharma would be untrustworthy. They would not resemble watering seeds in a fertile field, but would be like trying to water empty space. In the sense of existing in all sentient beings, the sugata heart also represents the foundation of the paths of sravakas and pratyekabud­dhas. However, their paths engage it only partially, and they do not attain the fruition of its full manifestation as buddhahood. This is similar to the repeated statements in the prajnàpàramitâ sütras that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are distant from mother prajnâpâramità by virtue of lacking skill in means and clinging to characteristics, while bodhisattvas are close for the opposite reasons (see also Abhisamayâlamkàra I.lOcd and III.2). The dharmadhàtu as “the disposition” is said to be indivisible, but, through focusing on it in three different ways, there are the three yànas (Abhisamayâlamkàra 1.39). The terms “permanent,” “enduring,” and “immutable” (to which “peaceful” is usually added) for the sugata heart and the dharmakaya are found in several places in the sütras on buddha nature and the Uttaratantra (I.80ff., II.3, and 11.29). As for the meanings of these terms, see Uttaratantra I.80ff. and RGW on it. In equating the adventitious stains (what is to be rejected) with both the imaginary and the dependent natures, the Lamp advances the classical Shentong model of the relationship between the three natures. In Shentong, the sugata heart (what is to be adopted) is usually said to"},{"pageNumber":1216,"pageContent":"1200 Notesbe equivalent to the perfect nature, which is not mentioned explicitly here in the Lamp but is clearly implied. Thus, in effect, the perfect nature is said to be empty of both the imaginary and the dependent natures. This differs from the usual model in Yogâcàra texts, which says that the perfect nature is the dependent nature empty of the imaginary nature. For details on these two models and the Indian sources in which the Shentong model already appears, see Brunnholzl 201 la.2609. For Rangtongpas, the naturally abiding disposition is emptiness (as the “cause” of the dharmakaya), and the unfolding disposition consists of the conditioned accumu­lations of merit and wisdom (as the causes of the rupakayas). For Shentongpas, both dispositions are just two sides of the same coin—the unfolding disposition is nothing but the naturally abiding disposition s becoming gradually manifest (“the dharmakaya that is in the process of fundamentally changing”). In this vein, Nàgàrjuna’s Dharma- dhâtustava (verses 5-7) gives the famous example of a lamp within a vase—the more holes that are punched into this vase, the more the lamp’s light can shine everywhere in an unimpeded manner.2610. Here, the Lamp makes the point that buddhahood is not only the freedom from clinging to the reference points of existence and nonexistence, but the actual freedom from reference points is necessarily free from any subtle clinging to a freedom from reference points too. Certain Shentongpas accuse the Rangtongpas of still entertain­ing a subtle habitual fixation onto the freedom from reference points after having re­futed the four possibilities of existence, nonexistence, both, and neither (though such a fixation is clearly and repeatedly denied and warned against in Madhyamaka texts). According to the Shentongpas, the actual freedom from clinging even to the freedom from reference points is the realization of the sugata heart. However, the sugata heart is not yet another “super-reference point” beyond the freedom from reference points, since it is clearly said here not to be observable either. Also, as Sakya Pandita says, it is impossible to go beyond the freedom from reference points, and even if one tried to go beyond, one would only end up again in a reference point. This also means that the sugata heart cannot be perceived by any referential state of mind, but only by person­ally experienced wisdom, which, by definition, is completely nonreferential and non­dual. However, this does not mean that the sugata heart is fundamentally difficult to realize, because, in itself, it is completely lacking any of the agitation and confusion of the dualistic mind. The sugata heart is unmoving, never stirring from its own nature, and ready to be disclosed at any time, once its adventitious stains are seen through. This accords with the Mahâmudrâ teachings saying that the nature of our mind is always present as the closest thing possible, but it is precisely because of its being too close and also its being too simple for our complex dualistic mind that we fail to recognize it. As for “the sugata hearts not conceiving of the element of the proximate afflictions,” “conceiving” means that the sugata heart neither created nor invented the stains, nor do they arise from it, rest on it, or share anything with it. Therefore, the sugata heart and the adventitious stains are not connected in any way, and thus the former is never defiled by the latter. The only two types of connection that Buddhist logicians accept are that two phenomena are either connected in terms of sharing the same nature or through depending on each other (either in the form of being cause and result or in the form of being support and supported). However, neither is the case for the sugata heart and the adventitious stains. From the perspective of seeming reality, they are mutually exclusive, and from the perspective of ultimate reality, the question of any possible connection or their being mutually exclusive is moot, because the adventitious stains never existed in the first place. Once the actual nonexistence of the adventitious stains"},{"pageNumber":1217,"pageContent":"Notes 1201is realized, it is conventionally said that they have been relinquished, but by virtue of their primordial nonexistence, they cannot be relinquished and thus they cannot come back either. Rather, to realize buddhahood is a matter of realizing what does not exist and seeing what actually does exist. This is similar to realizing that a mottled rope is not a snake—there is no need to remove the “snake” in order to see the rope, but clearly per­ceiving the rope as the only thing that is actually there is sufficient, and, once certainty about this is gained, the “snake” will never come back. Thus, from the very beginning, the sugata heart exists absolutely independently of the adventitious stains, and their disappearance does not represent a removal of something existent that might come back or arise again, but is simply realizing the fact that they never existed in the first place. For these reasons, once such realization happens, the sugata heart simply dwells in its natural irreversible state, in which there is no way for intrinsically nonexistent stains to reappear.2611. This passage is almost literally found at the end of R G W ’s above-mentioned quote from the A vatamsakasutra about the canvases with a trichiliocosm drawn on them (J24; D4025, fol. 87a.4-5). As mentioned before, the Sanskrit pratyabhijna (Tib. so sor mngon par shes pa) for “recognizing” can also mean “to remember” and “to come to ones self or to recover consciousness,” which is quite fitting here in the sense of (re)awakening to ones true nature of being a buddha.2612. As already briefly mentioned in section 2.1.1.1., the uncovering of beings’ own sugata heart depends not only on their own sugata heart, but also on its being blessed through the sugata heart of buddhas. Beyond the superficial level of buddhas and sentient be­ings interacting, such as the buddhas, from the perspective of those to be guided, ap­parently teaching, performing miracles, and so on, the actual interaction (“the miracle of the mind”) occurs on the most fundamental level of one buddha natures influencing or “blessing” the other (this corresponds to RGVV’s explaining that the dharmakaya of buddhas consists not only of the pure dharmadhatu but also of its natural outflow, which manifests as teaching sentient beings). It is not that there is some real exchange between two buddha natures or a “friendly invasion” of the buddha nature of sen­tient beings by the one of buddhas, but the process of blessing is comparable to the above-mentioned example of the strings on a violin vibrating and resounding when the strings of another one are played. This analogy fits with the literal meaning of the Tibetan word byin gyis rlobs pa for “blessing,” which is explained as “to change something into being powerful through radiance or brilliance, or, to instill power and bring it forth.” That the power over ultimate reality is able to influence seeming re­ality can be illustrated by the example of the influence that a mind that recognizes a dream to be a dream can have on the appearances in that dream. Upon not only rec­ognizing, but gaining mastery over these appearances, this mind can control and even change them into anything at will. This is comparable to a buddha’s emanating and transforming certain appearances in order to teach beings. Such miracles of a buddha include the display of attaining awakening, its qualities, and its activities (the last three vajra points). In general, the occurrence of enlightened activity is said to depend on three factors—the blessings of a buddhas dharmakaya, that buddhas former aspiration prayers as a bodhisattva to be able to promote the welfare of all beings, and the (at least somewhat) purified minds of sentient beings. Among these, the aspiration prayers are like the great amount of initial fuel and energy that is needed to launch a rocket, which, once in outer space, keeps flying forever without further fuel or energy supplies. The last paragraph in the text above on the sugata heart’s specific and general characteris­tics corresponds closely to RGVV’s description of the sugata hearts representing the"},{"pageNumber":1218,"pageContent":"1202 Notesparamita of supreme purity, that is, being both naturally pure and pure of adventitious stains (J34; D4025, fol. 93a.3-4; see section 2.2.1.3. in the text below). It is also echoed in the description of the dharmadhatu’s specific and general characteristics in Madh- yantavibhaga V.18-19.2613. These paramitas are described in the Srimdladevisutra (D45.48, fols. 273b.3-274a.l) and Uttaratantra 1.35-38. See also section 2.2.1.3. in the text below.2614. The ways ordinary beings, sravakas, and pratyekabuddhas cling versus a buddha’s complete lack of clinging to anything may again be illustrated by the dream example. Within a dream, an object may be taken to be permanent, while, from the perspective of the waking state, it is impermanent. In actual fact, however, it is not even imperma­nent, since it never really existed in the first place (a nonexistent cannot be either per­manent or impermanent). The same goes for happiness and suffering in a dream—both as well as their seeming causes are nothing but appearances in the dreamers mind. Their true nature is minds natural luminosity, and to realize and dwell in it is the true bliss beyond all fabrications of happiness and suffering. The way in which Shentong­pas avoid the two extremes of permanence and extinction, respectively, is to say that the phenomena of seeming reality are impermanent, without self, and so on, while the ultimate sugata heart exists beyond all reference points of existence and nonexis­tence. Or, relative tathagatas do not exist, while ultimate tathagatas do exist. In general, “seeming tathagatas” refers to what appears physically and verbally as tathagatas and their activities. In particular, saying that seeming tathagatas do not exist represents a rejection of the position of certain Rangtongpas (such as the Gelugpas) who claim that a tathagatas wisdom, qualities, and rupakayas belong to seeming reality. As for “the tathagata hearts not falling into extremes or confines,” this expression is reminiscent of the Third Karmapas opening lines of the first chapter of his Profound Inner Reality (“The cause is beginningless mind as such. Though it is neither confined nor biased . ..”). Its autocommentary (Rang byung rdo rje n.d., 37) explains not “confined” as the very nature of the minds being inexpressible as being either the same or different in all buddhas and sentient beings. It is “not biased” because it does not fall into any biases such as permanence or extinction.2615. This is a critique of the Rangtong assertion that the sugata heart is nothing but the sheer emptiness that is the object of meditative equipoise, while the illusion-like mere appearances of subsequent attainment are nothing but dependent origination, which also lacks any nature of its own. To say that, even in this context of illusion-like ap­pearances, the sugata heart is neither existent nor nonexistent comes down to avoiding the issue of what is the ground, the nature, and the fruition of the path even on a conventional level (see also section 2.5. on the purpose of teaching buddha nature). In other words, in mere emptiness, there would simply be no basis for carrying over any realization during meditative equipoise into subsequent attainment, nor any basis for accumulating merit during such subsequent attainment. Thus, to still speak about a subsequent attainment and accumulating merit during it is dishonest. As for such a position “being mixed with dialectics,” it is not a genuine way of experientially going beyond reference points, but a self-deception fabricated through reasoning with re­gard to how things actually are within the sphere of personally experienced wisdom (see also the comments in RG W on Uttaratantra 1.12). Compare Mahayanasamgraha X.3 (D4048, fol. 38a. 1-2) on the last one of the five characteristics of the dharmakaya, which says, “It has the characteristic of being inconceivable, because pure suchness is to be experienced personally, lacks any example in the world, and is not the sphere of dialectics.”"},{"pageNumber":1219,"pageContent":"Notes 12032616. The point here seems to be that, let alone the four mistaken notions of purity, perma­nence, bliss, and self of ordinary beings with regard to afflicted phenomena applying to the sugata heart, any notions of supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self about a Brahman, dtman, or creator god as found in various non-Buddhist Indian traditions do not apply to buddha nature either. For, it is beyond all reference points and spec­ulations and yet pervades all appearances and experiences. In this, it is like the mind that pervades all the illusory appearances in a dream, but is beyond these mere ap­pearances. However, it has to be acknowledged that the descriptions of the ultimate in many Buddhist and non-Buddhist Indian texts are often exactly the same (which is also recognized by a number of Tibetan scholars, such as Mipham Rinpoche in his commentary on the Madhyamakalamkara and Mikyo Dorje in his commentary on the Abhisamaydlarnkdra) and that Buddhist texts adopted many of these descriptions from non-Buddhist ones (supreme purity, permanence, bliss, and self being just a few exam­ples) and vice versa. It is noteworthy that even a Madhyamika like Bhaviveka (Madhya- makahrdaya, D3855, fols. 30b.5-31a.l) uses “self,” “permanent,” and “purity” as terms for the ultimate (the fact that all phenomena are unborn), because it is the unfabricated nature, does not deteriorate, and is without afflictions, respectively. In this context, the senior contemporary Kagyii master Thrangu Rinpoche said that if one does not prac­tice and realize the teaching on buddha nature in meditation, its mere descriptions are in fact just like the Samkhya position.2617. For example, this is said in Santidevas Bodhicaryavatara IX.2c: “The ultimate is not the sphere of cognition.” Pawo Rinpoches commentary on this (Brunnholzl 2004, 622-24; here abbreviated and slightly rephrased), which accords with Mikyo Dorje’s point that the ultimate is not accessible through reasoning but only through person­ally experienced wisdom in meditative equipoise, says: “[Ultimate reality] is that for which it does not matter whether buddhas have arrived or not; it is what could not be contrived even by the Buddha. . .. Thus, the native nature of all phenomena was not, is not, and cannot become the sphere of the consciousnesses of any ordinary beings, noble ones, learners, or nonlearners whatsoever, be they conceptual or nonconceptual [consciousnesses], perceptions, or inferential cognitions. For this dharmadhatu just as it is, the conventional term ‘ultimate reality’ is used... For example, when one [mentally] analyzes the Brahma world, [such an inves­tigation] is nothing but an analysis through imagining [this world within] one’s owncognition [Thus,] this [cognition] possesses the aspect of an object generality in theform of the Brahma world. However, through that, the Brahma world does not come here, and neither does the analyst go to the Brahma world. Hence, this [type of analysis] mistakes the analysis of one’s own mind through one’s own mind for [an actual analysis when one directly faces the Brahma world].... Consequently, [even] focusing on the ultimate is also nothing but this kind of [mistakenness]. Therefore, the ultimate is defi­nitely not the sphere of cognition.. .. ‘Why is the ultimate not the sphere of cognition?’ Because it is asserted that cognition, or consciousness, is the very seeming and it is impossible for the seeming to take the ultimate as its object.... ‘Through what is it certain that the ultimate is not an object of cognition?’ This is certain through the principle of the inconceivable nature of phenomena. When the great noble ones settle in meditative equipoise within the dharmadhatu, then this be­comes all the more subtle and inconceivable the more they settle [within it]. This is so for the following reasons: That very something that is settled in meditative equipoise"},{"pageNumber":1220,"pageContent":"1204 Notesand the one who settles it will subside, while one is not able to realize a limit of the dharmadhâtu. Even the tathàgatas do not state any extent of the dharmadhâtu.Thus, it is seen that the dharmadhâtu is not an object of speech, reflection, or ex­pression. It is for just this [type of seeing] that the conventional terms ‘penetrating the nature of phenomena’ and ‘beholding ultimate reality’ are used. The conventional term ‘personally experienced wisdom’ is then used for the very knowledge that does not observe the characteristics of reference points in terms of subject and object. Thus, the nature of phenomena is not seen through apprehending a subject and an object. Rather, if one knows that subject and object are not observable, one engages in the nature of phenomena. Therefore, [the expression] ‘personally experienced wisdom realizes the nature of phenomena’ is a conventional term that is used based on something else. However, in no way does this abide in the mode of subject, object, something to be realized, and a realizer in the way that these are imputed by cognition.”2618. The other two bodhisattvas indicated by this expression are Maňjušri and Vajrapâni, all three being considered as the protectors of the kriyàtantras. More likely though, this is a reference to the so-called trilogy of bodhisattva commentaries that is often given as a source of the Shentong view (Vajrapàni’s commentary on the Cakrasamvaratan- tra, the Vimalaprabhà commentary on the Kâlacakratantra by Kalkin Pundarika, an emanation of Avalokitešvara, and Vajragarbha’s Hevajrapindârthatïkâ). The reference to Maňjušri is probably to the Maňjušrmámasamgíti (also often used by Dôlpopa and other Shentongpas), which the Tibetan tradition accepts as perhaps the most authori­tative Buddhist text of definitive meaning, with its terminology being used to describe the ultimate not being open to interpretation. The Tengyur also contains a related Maň- jušrmámasamgítyabhisamaya (D1400), which is attributed to Avalokitešvara himself.2619. The emptiness of all phenomena of seeming reality can be established and under­stood through words and reasons by any ordinary being who is able to follow logic and reasoning. This is evidenced by modern physics arriving at the conclusion of the utter insubstantiality of all phenomena. Thus, the Buddha and Sàntideva must have had something more in mind when they taught that ultimate reality is beyond the range of an ordinary being’s mind. That this refers to mind’s luminous nature or the sugata heart is clear from many passages in the sûtras, tantras, and also from the songs of realization of the great siddhas. Mikyô Dorje contrasts the limited understanding of masters who are ordinary beings (that is, below the first bodhisattvabhümi) with what the two supreme masters of Indian mahàyàna—Nàgàrjuna (mainly in his collection of praises) and Asafiga—say on this topic (these two are considered to be bodhisattvas on the first and third bhümis, respectively). Following the Buddha’s prophecies in certain sûtras and tantras, the Tibetan tradition unanimously agrees that Asaňga is the one who distinguishes between the expedient and the definitive meanings in the Buddha’s teach­ings. By contrast, certain ordinary masters mistake the sûtras of definitive meaning as being of expedient meaning (that is, entailing an intention). Also, they wrongly think that everything that is not to be taken literally is necessarily of expedient meaning. As the Lamp says, the four páramitás of the sugata heart are not to be taken literally, but the teachings that they contain are to be taken as the definitive meaning. For example, the pàramità of supreme self in no way refers to an actual ultimate self or atman be­yond self and the lack of self. Rather, it represents one of the many conventional terms (many of which are also used by Rangtongpas) that point to what is beyond the scope of terms and can be realized only through the power of personally experienced wisdom in meditative equipoise."},{"pageNumber":1221,"pageContent":"Notes 12052620. Both the Rumtek book edition and the xylographie block print have chos nyid. How­ever, in line with what was said repeatedly before (that luminosity or the sugata heart does not conceive of, or cling to, the adventitious stains), chos (phenomena) seems to make more sense. Translated as it stands, the above phrase would be “without conceiv­ing of, or forming, anything of the entire nature of phenomena, but operating as the nature of all of samsâra and nirvàna.”2621. The Tibetan khams here could also be understood as “the realms.”2622. This section of the text begins by contrasting the subject-object pairs of ordinary be­ings and noble ones. “Knowable objects” (Tib. shes bya) and the “cognitions” (Tib. shes pa) that cognize them only refer to the sphere of seeming reality. The ultimate subject and object, respectively, are nonconceptual wisdom (“the nature of phenomena”) and the dharmadhàtu, which are summarized in the term “dharmadhàtu wisdom,” the fifth and most fundamental among the five wisdoms (such as mirrorlike wisdom). Needless to say, to speak of the ultimate subject and object is just on the conventional level, since personally experienced, self-aware wisdom is completely nonconceptual and nondual. Thus, to speak of wisdom (the nature of all phenomena) “perceiving” the dharmadhàtu is just another way of saying that minds luminous nature rests in itself in a completely uncontrived, nondual, nonconceptual, and nonreferential manner. Unlike Shentong­pas who equate the nature of phenomena with wisdom as the cognizing subject, Rang- tongpas usually take the nature of phenomena to be nothing but emptiness (the object), while nonconceptual wisdom is a part of seeming reality. Emptiness is said to pervade all seeming and ultimate subjects and objects alike, which is considered as the equality of samsâra and nirvàna. In the Shentong system, to say that the dharmadhàtu pervades the knowable objects and cognitions of ordinary beings, but has absolutely no connec­tion to them is the same as the repeated statement above that the sugata heart, just as space, is the foundation of the adventitious stains, but is not connected to them. Next, there is a reference to Maitreyas Dharmadharmatâvibhàga, in which “phenomena” refer to all subjects and their objects within the sphere of the dualistic mind, which are none other than the sum of the adventitious stains (or samsâra). “The nature of phenomena” is discussed in this text in great detail under the topic of “fundamental change.” The nature of this fundamental change is explained as suchness’s having be­come free from all adventitious stains, which means that these stains no longer appear, while only suchness itself appears. The basis or foundation of this fundamental change is described in detail as nonconceptual wisdom. Though the Dharmadharmatâvibhàga does not call this nonconceptual wisdom “sugata heart” and does not explicitly say that it is not empty of itself, it describes four flaws that would occur if said fundamental change (and thus nonconceptual wisdom) did not exist, as well as four advantages that its existence entails. Also, as mentioned before, the text uses the examples of water, gold, and space in the same way as many other Yogàcàra works do, such as the Madh- yântavibhâga, the Mahàyânasütràlamkâra, and the Viniscayasamgraham (for details, see Brunnholzl 2012b, 184-95, 250-98, and 305-28). As for the explanation in the last paragraph of the Lamp in the text above, it corresponds to RGVVs comments on Ut­taratantra 1.39 and describes how the realization of the noble ones resting in mind’s luminous nature is nothing other than what is called “nonabiding nirvàna.” To speak of the sugata heart as the nature of samsâra and nirvàna being inseparable is like say­ing that the appearances in a dream are actually nothing but the mind of the waking state, because it is the very same mind that is the basis for both dreams and the waking state. On the notions of “the nonabiding nirvàna” and “the inseparability of samsâra"},{"pageNumber":1222,"pageContent":"1206 Notesand nirvana” from the perspective of the tathagata heart, see also the first paragraph of section 2.3.4. and the last paragraph of section 2.4.3. in the text below.2623. This is stated in the Srlmaladevisutra (D45.48, fol. 274b.5) and Uttaratantra 1.40-41.2624. From a Rangtong point of view of taking the sugata heart as being mere emptiness, it is particularly hard to explain how emptiness could trigger weariness with suffering and striving for nirvana (just as it is hard to explain how mental qualities such as a buddha s omniscience, loving-kindness, and compassion could be parts of mere emptiness). Usually, in Buddhism, what is conditioned is defined as “what arises from causes and conditions.” The explanation here that what is conditioned lacks causes and conditions and is nonexistent is obviously from the perspective of ultimate reality (as is pointed out in the next section’s answer to the objection that conditioned phenomena without causes and conditions are not tenable). The point here is that as long as the path oper­ates on the level of seeming reality or conditioned phenomena, the overall category of adventitious stains (what is ultimately nonexistent, but seemingly appears to be condi­tioned) has two facets—what appears as the factors to be relinquished (such as the flaws of samsara) and their remedies (such as becoming weary of it and striving for nirvana). Though the latter appear to relinquish the former, in essence and from the perspective of buddha nature, they are both extrinsic to the sugata heart and thus are both nothing but impermanent adventitious stains. For, what appear as remedies make the factors to be relinquished cease, and once they have done so, they themselves cease too (thus the Lamp’s above phrase “what is adventitious, conditioned, and lacks causes and con­ditions being mutually impermanent”). Eventually, once the path operates on the level of ultimate reality (from the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing onward), it is the nonconceptual wisdom that directly experiences the sugata heart that overcomes both factors to be relinquished and remedies (the classical example for this is a fire that is produced by rubbing two sticks eventually consuming these sticks). Thus, it is not that the sugata heart itself could become weary because it never experiences any im­perfection or suffering in the first place. Rather, it is the power of the sugata heart that seemingly triggers or manifests as an initial stir—weariness—within the realm of the adventitious stains (and actually sustains this stir), though the two are not intrinsically connected. This stir manifests as remedial states of mind counteracting those that are to be relinquished in order to realize the sugata heart. However, up to the first bhumi, this process happens entirely within the sphere of the dualistic mind, that is, within the adventitious stains themselves. Once the natural wisdom radiance of the sugata heart shines forth fully, even the most subtle remedies dissolve back into mind’s luminous nature, having been nothing but its (misperceived) natural play all along. To use the dream example, even when one has a nightmare, the mind, as it is in its waking state, is never really affected by it. When the dreaming mind recognizes the dream as a dream, in a sense, it returns to its waking state, but also influences the dream experience, such as thinking, “This is an awful nightmare, I must transform it or wake up.” Though effec­tive, such thoughts are still dualistic thoughts within a dream. Once one is completely awake, in order to recognize that one is awake, one no longer needs such thoughts that one had in the dream, such as “It is only a dream.” For, conventionally, the waking state is, in and by itself, self-evident.2625. In brief, on the level of seeming reality, all illusory appearances of both the wak­ing state and dreams have equally illusory causes and conditions. Ultimately and upon analysis, neither these appearance nor their causes can be experienced or found. As for the example of the rope and the snake, there are varying interpretations in terms of the three natures. However, the Shentong understanding is that the ropes being mistaken"},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"Notes 120 7for, and labeled as, a snake represents the imaginary nature, the mere appearance of what is called “a rope” and is mistaken as a snake the dependent nature, and the funda­mental space of mind’s luminosity in which both appear the perfect nature.2626. It seems to be contradictory to attain buddhahood through accumulating more causes and conditions if there are no causes and conditions in the first place, but this is only so if one does not clearly distinguish between the two levels of reality—seeming and ultimate. On the level of seeming reality, one can speak of the sugata heart’s being obscured and its becoming unobscured, which is brought about by seeming remedial causes and conditions that counteract the seeming factors to be relinquished. On this level, and this level only, the principle of dependently originating causes and results works. Ultimately, however, the nature of the sugata heart never changes into any­thing else, no matter whether it, from the perspective of sentient beings or adventitious stains, seems to be “obscured” first and “purified” later. As mentioned before, “purifi­cation” takes place only on the level of seeming reality or the adventitious stains, but it is precisely on this level that it is necessary because it is only on this level (never on the level of ultimate reality) that the sugata heart appears to be stained. As was said in the above passages on the sugata heart’s blessing, in actual fact, the ground or fun­damental cause (the sugata heart), the path as its natural outflow, and the result (the full manifestation of the sugata heart as the dharmakaya) are inseparable in nature. In other words, to speak of the path as a natural outflow of the sugata heart means that the actual driving force of the path is buddha natures natural radiance shining through more and more. The full culmination of this is called “dharmakaya,” which means that the path accords with the sugata heart in that the latter, conventionally speaking, is both the “cause” and the “result” of this path. The changelessness of the sugata heart throughout its being adventitiously obscured and purified during the three phases of ordinary beings, bodhisattvas on the path, and buddhas is referred to throughout the Uttaratantra (for example, I.45ÍF.). After this paragraph in the Lamp, an interlinear note in the Tibetan editions says, “Furthermore, in this Land of Snows, some who hate noble Asafiga and have bad fortunes proclaim, ‘This great master accepts the existence of the disposition that is the cut-off disposition’ and ‘He does not assert that, ultimately, there is a single yana.’” No doubt, R G W asserts the single yàna several times and, through following the Uttaratantra’s central theme of all beings’ being endowed with buddha nature, does not assert a “cut-off disposition” in the sense of its being impossible for certain beings to ever become buddhas. For the details of issues around the “cut-off disposition” and the single yana, as well as the positions of Asafiga and other Yogàcàras on them, see Brunnholzl 2010, 447-48, and in particular, 879nl301.2627. Both the Rumtek book edition and the xylographie block print have rgyu (“cause”). Given the phrase “the continuum of the perfect path that makes . . . perceptible” in the preceding sentence, it would also make sense to read rgyu as rgyud (“continuum”).2628. This paragraph is based on RG W on Uttaratantra 1.42-44 (J37-39; D4025, fols. 94b.5-95b.2).2629. In general, the dharmakaya is often referred to as “dharmatâkàya” (“the kàya of the nature of phenomena”) or “svàbhàvika-dharmatàkàya,” with “dharmakaya” being explained as an abbreviation of these two terms. See, for example, Aryavimuktisena’s Abhisamayàlamkàravrtti (D3787, fol. 192a.7-8), Vasubandhu’s Mahàyànasamgra- habhásya on X.l, the Buddhabhümyupadesa (Taishó 1530, 325c5-7), Sllabhadra’s Bud- dhabhûmivyâkhyâna (D3997, fol. 272b.5), and Jfiânacandra’s Kâyatrayavrtti (D3891, fol. 8b.2). In his commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra (Brunnholzl 2010, 753n611), the Eighth Karmapa says that, in his opinion, the dharmakaya and the svàbhâvikakâya"},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"1208 Notesare not different in both being the dharmatákáya, but that this dharmatákáya has two aspects—the aspect of its own nature’s being natural luminosity and the aspect of never abandoning that which is its own nature. The former is taught as the dharmakaya and the latter as the svábhávikakáya. By virtue of this meaning, the dominant condition of primarily the svábhávikakáya makes this dharmatákáya appear as the sambhoga- káya within the stainless dharmadhátu, while the dominant condition of primarily the dharmakaya makes it appear as the nirmánakáya, together with its enlightened activity, for those who are endowed with the pure appearances that are a natural outflow of the dharmadhátu. In this context of the Lamp, this means that, in themselves, the appear­ances of the rüpakáyas do not constitute buddhahood, but the dharmakáya’s power to manifest them is an intrinsic capacity of the sugata heart. As for “mastery over all phenomena,” in the Shentong view, this means to have realized mind’s luminous nature and thus to have full control over all phenomena, which are nothing but luminosity’s radiant display.2630. This quote is from the Anünatvdpürnatvanirdeiaparivarta (Taishó 668, 467b) and is also found in RGW on Uttaratantra 1.50 (J41; D4025, fol. 97a.l-2). The first sentence in the Lamp slightly differs: “Therefore, Sáriputra, the dharmakáya is not other than the basic element of sentient beings.”2631. This may refer to some who explain the álaya-consciousness (which in fact is nothing other than the adventitious stains) as being the same as buddha nature, which a superfi­cial reading of certain passages in the Lankavatarasutra seems to suggest.2632. Uttaratantra I.51cd.2633. This refers to the example of the four elements’ arising and ceasing in ordinary space in Uttaratantra I.52ff, which illustrates the process of the skandhas and so on arising and ceasing within the basic space of the sugata heart without altering it.2634. Compare RGW on. 1.26 saying that the tathágata heart “due to its being the seed of the supramundane attributes, should be understood as the cause for the arising of the three jewels.” RGW^ also speaks of the tathágata heart as being the cause for the puri­fication of the mind (J69) and the cause for attaining the three káyas, glossing “dhátu” to mean “cause” (J72).2635. The Eighth Karmapa’s commentary on the Abhisamaydlamkára (Brunnholzl 2011b, 248-49) quotes the Dasabhümikasütra and the Madhyamakávatára, saying that bodhi­sattvas on the sixth bhümi are able to enter the meditative absorption of cessation of bodhisattvas, while on the seventh bhümi they are able to enter and rise from this med­itative absorption in a single instant. According to the Karmapa, these statements are made with the intention of such bodhisattvas not being able or being able, respectively, to enter this meditative absorption in the manner of being without any characteristics. However, in general, he says, according to the prajñápáramitá sütras, bodhisattvas are able to enter the meditative absorption of cessation from the path of seeing onward.2636. Compare section 2.2.2.1. in the text above.2637. From the perspective of buddha nature, nirvána is nothing but one’s own mind in its natural state, which is present in all sentient beings primordially and without ever being altered by adventitious stains. Therefore, in terms of their ultimate true nature, sentient beings are already in nirvána. As was explained before, to realize mind’s lumi­nous nature means that dualistic mind dissolves within the expanse of this primordial nirvána without any abiding, that is, without any ground to hold on to and without any reference points. When this luminous nature, after the relinquishment of adventitious stains, appears to others as persons like Buddha £ákyamuni, it is called “nirmánakáya.” When this luminosity (ultimate reality, the svábhávikakáya, or buddhahood) manifests"},{"pageNumber":1225,"pageContent":"Notes 1209as pure appearances in all buddha realms, it is called “sambhogakaya.” Thus, though the ultimate reality of all buddhas is single and undifferentiable, it appears in diverse pure forms (such as the lords of the five buddha families) for the minds of greatly pu­rified bodhisattvas. The dharmakaya is nothing but the sugata heart itself—the ultimate nature of both samsara and nirvana. In this way, the primordial nirvana of the sugata heart is explained as manifesting as the three buddhakayas. Again, the point is made that an emptiness that is understood as the mere absence of a self cannot qualify as true liberation with all its buddha qualities, but that minds own luminous wisdom nature must gain full power over itself.2638. See Uttaratantra I.95cd-152.2639. These examples are found in verses 5-7 and 74-76 of the Dharmadhatustava. The remaining eleven examples for the dharmadhatu s remaining unaltered within adventi­tious stains are butter within milk, an encrusted beryl, gold in its ore, rice grains in their husks, sun and moon covered by five obscurations, a soiled fireproof garment, water deep in the earth, a baby in the womb, the same waters being cold or warm, milk mixed with water, and a banana tree and its fruit.2640. This refers to the “empty forms” that are the ten signs of accomplishment when practicing the six-branch yoga of the Kalacakratantra (for details, see GISM, 197-98).2641. These two sentences correspond to Uttaratantra 1.153. Speaking of faith here does not mean to simply believe that there is a buddha nature, without realizing the unreality of all the adventitious phenomena that obscure it. This may be temporarily appro­priate and beneficial for beginners, but it is important to keep in mind that, even in the Shentong approach, during the stages of developing the correct view, the use of reasoning is necessary to dispel all wrong views and all reference points. However, once that has been accomplished, the mind needs to turn inward and directly face its own true nature, not continue to negate. Thus, ultimately, it is in order to stop the tendency to keep negating at this point that faith in, aspiration for, and openness toward the inconceivable reality of the tathagata heart are needed. Hence, this does not mean faith in the sense of believing in something impossible, irrational, contrary to reason, or unreachable but being open to finally recognizing that one has been a buddha all along.2642. As for “aspects of seeming reality,” in addition to realizing that the five skandhas lack a personal self, both ¿ravakas and pratyekabuddhas realize that coarse collections of matter and continua of mind do not exist ultimately. As for “the mere emptiness of a real existence that is other in substance,” according to the Eighth Karmapas commen­tary on the Abhisamayalamkara (Brunnholzl 2011b, 138-39 and 221-22), Vaibhasikas cling to appearances as being outer objects, while Sautrantikas and Real Aspectarian Mere Mentalists cling to appearances as being aspects of mind (though the former still claim that there are imperceptible material entities independent of mind that cast these aspects into the mind). According to the Eighth Karmapa, pratyekabuddhas hold the view of Real Aspectarian Mere Mentalists and thus realize that apprehender and apprehended are empty of being other in substance, which is equivalent to realizing the lack of an independent nature of the apprehended. However, they lack the mahayana realization that both apprehender and apprehended are completely empty of a nature of their own.2643. In his Madhyamakavatarabhasya (D3862, fols. 226a.2-228a.3), Candraklrti asserts that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas also realize phenomenal identitylessness, adduc­ing three reasonings and seven scriptural quotations (note that he and his commenta­tor Jayananda are the only Indian Madhyamikas who assert this). However, there is a considerable number of Tibetan masters, foremost among them Tsongkhapa and his"},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"1210 Notesfollowers, who side with Candrakirti’s position. In his commentary on the Madhya- makàvatàra, the Eighth Karmapa also follows Candrakirti, but extensively refutes the claim that the difference in the realization of sràvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats in comparison to bodhisattvas lies in the conciseness of reasoning. Rather, the Karmapa says, concise versus extensive identitylessness means that ¿râvakas and pratyekabud- dhas, by virtue of being interested solely in their own personal liberation, only realize identitylessness with regard to the skandhas, dhàtus, and àyatanas that make up their own continua as well as the phenomena of the uncontaminated reality of the path. Un­like them, bodhisattvas also realize identitylessness with regard to all remaining know- able objects pertaining to themselves and all other beings, such as the sugata heart, the dharmakâya, and dharmadhàtu wisdom. For details on this issue, see Brunnholzl 2004, 424-38. Throughout his commentary on the Abhisamayâlamkâra, the Eighth Karmapa follows the Indian mainstream position of denying that ¿râvakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the mahàyâna realization of phenomenal identitylessness. Rather, ¿râvakas realize only personal identitylessness; pratyekabuddhas, personal identitylessness and one half of phenomenal identitylessness (the lack of nature of the apprehended); and bodhisattvas, both personal and phenomenal identitylessness in their entireties.2644. Compare the Šrímáládevísůtra (D45.48, fol. 275a.3-4) that says, “Bhagavan, this tathâgata heart is the heart of the supreme dharmadhàtu. It is the heart of the dhar­makaya. It is the heart of the supramundane dharmas. It is the heart of the naturally pure dharmas.” An abbreviated variation of this passage is also quoted in R G W (J72- 73; D4025, fol. 112a.l).2645. This paragraph corresponds to the last part of R G W s comments on 1.155. As an elaboration on this, Uttaratantra 11.33 says that, just as people born blind, ordinary beings never see the tathâgata heart, while even noble bodhisattvas are like newborn infants who see just a small part of the sun from inside the house of their birth. As for “samsâra and nirvàna not being different from the perspective of the tathâgata heart,” “samsâra” simply refers to this tathâgata hearts being temporarily obscured by adven­titious stains, while “nirvàna” means nothing other than this very tathâgata hearts hav­ing become free from those stains. Thus, since the adventitious stains are primordially nonexistent, it is solely the tathâgata heart that is the ultimately real underlying basis of both what appears as samsâra and what appears as nirvàna. Compare also section2.2.2.I. on this.2646. Even ¿râvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize that the object of their own realization— the lack of a self (nirvána)—is empty and thus they realize that the assumed self of other beings (samsâra) is empty too. However, merely through that realization, they do not become buddhas because such realization is not sufficient to eradicate the latent tendencies of ignorance that still exist in all ¿ràvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats as well as all bodhisattvas up through the tenth bhûmi. Compare R G W (J32-34) on the four obstructions to the four pâramitâs of supreme purity, bliss, permanence, and self that are the qualities of the dharmakàya, the primary one of which is the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance that is still present in ¿râvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. In that context, RGW also says that the pàramità of the supreme self “should be understood by virtue of being free from the reference points of a self due to having abandoned the extreme of the tlrthikas and by virtue of being free from the reference points of no-self due to having abandoned the extreme of the ¿râvakas.”2647. A more extended version of this statement, which includes the ensuing question of why buddha nature is then taught to anyone at all, is found in R G W (J77; D4025, fol. 114b.5-6)."},{"pageNumber":1227,"pageContent":"Notes 12112648. This refers to the five flaws explained in Uttaratantra 1.157-67. See also section2.5.2.1. in the text below.2649. The last two sentences combine the contents of Uttaratantra 1.156-57/159-60 and 1.160/163 as well as RGVV’s passage “Thus, one clearly sees that when something does not exist somewhere, the [latter] is empty of the [former]. In accordance with actual reality, one understands that what remains there exists as a real existent” (J76, D4025, fol. 114a.3). The last sentence in the Lamp here corresponds well with YDC’s comments on Uttaratantra 1.158-61/161-63 (see appendix 6, section 2.2.).2650. In other words, according to those who take buddha nature to refer to nothing but emptiness, the teachings on the tathágata heart are only like a carrot held in front of beings who lack the courage to generate bodhicitta and face emptiness (see Uttaratan­tra 1.161). However, Mikyo Dorje says that if these teachings were not of definitive meaning, the five flaws would not be flaws, but correct attitudes, since the tathágata heart does not really exist. Consequently, any striving for it would not accord with how things actually are. Thus, such teachings would be nothing but an utter hypoc­risy of fooling people into believing into something that does not really exist. In other words, one cannot have it both ways—teaching people to relax through the teachings on buddha nature in order to get rid of the five flaws and at the same time claiming that these teachings are not really true. Though the two flaws of clinging to what is unreal and excessive self-cherishing are not explicitly mentioned here in the Lamp, the same would apply to them as well. That is, if there is no tathágata heart, it would be perfectly fine to cling to the real existence of the adventitious stains (seeming reality) and take them to be the only reality there is. It would also be correct not to develop the great love and compassion that is based on realizing the equality of oneself and others due to all beings possessing buddha nature. In addition, if the teachings on buddha nature were merely like an enticing carrot, they would not even work as such but only pointlessly delay the ultimately justified self-contempt and faintheartedness of beings. That, is, first, beings would become depressed by hearing that they have no self and that everything is empty, then they would be cheered up by hearing about buddha nature, but ultimately they would have to find out that the teachings on buddha nature are not true either, so they would end up ultimately becoming depressed. Note that this section of the Lamp and the following one are quoted in Jamgon Kongtruls commentary on the Uttaratantra (Kong sprul bio gros mtha’ yas 2005b, 124).

This is a Tibetan expression implying precision and perseverance, originally coming from making meat soup through breaking bones with a rock to extract the marrow. As an expression for ones practice, it means to be decisive and effective, as well as striking the vital point, just as when hitting the right spot on a bone with a rock in a proper way so that one is able to crush the bone (that is, not striking it too weakly or off-center).2668. VI.8.2669. GISM has simply rjes, which as the third element in a triad with “preliminaries” and “main part” usually means “conclusion,” but the corresponding heading in the text below says “subsequent attainment” (rjes thob).2670. These are also known as “the four seals of the dharma” and are listed at the end of this paragraph.2671. The Tibetan word my a ngan las ’das pa for “nirvana” literally means “beyond mis­ery.” The phrase here could also be rendered as “the nirvana of [being beyond] adven­titious mistakenness.”2672. Tib. lam rim.2673. Lafikavatarasutra, X.750-52 (the translation of these three verses and the following one follows the Sanskrit).2674. Lafikavatarasutra, X.753.2675. The Tibetan term la zlo ba literally means “having crossed a mountain pass” and thus can also be understood as “arriving at a decisive experience” and “leaping into.”2676. This is an expression for the common Mahamudra approach of beginning to culti­vate superior insight through searching for any essence or characteristics of the mind that rests as a result of the previous cultivation of calm abiding, such as what color or shape this resting mind might have, where and how it arises, abides, and ceases, whether it is inside or outside the body, and whether it is different from the moving mind.2677. This could also be read as “let the basic awareness that is without foundation rest within the state of nonmeditation.”2678. See, for example, Anguttara Nikdya III.65. The four reliances are that one should rely not on persons but on the dharma; not on words but on the meaning; not on"},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"Notes 1213consciousness but on wisdom; and not on the expedient meaning but on the definitive meaning.2679. Except for omitting “Ànanda” at the beginning of the first, third, and fifth sentences and adding “speech” in the sixth one, this is a literal quote from the Sthirâdhyâsayapari- vartasütra (D224, fol. 172b.2-3), which is also found in RGW (J2; D4025, fol. 74b.6-7) as the scriptural source for the three jewels as the first three vajra points.2680. Compare Lankavatarasutra X.256-57 (D107, fol. 168b.5-6; translation according to the Sanskrit, the Kangyur versions, and the versions quoted in different Indian texts):By relying on mere mindOne does not imagine outer objects.By resting in the focal object of suchness,One should go beyond mere mind too.Having gone beyond mere mind,One must even go beyond nonappearance.The yogin who rests in nonappearance Sees the mahayana.The negative in line 257d (which obviously changes the meaning significantly) is also found in the Kangyur versions of the sütra, but it is lacking in the identical verses 54-55 in Nàgàrjunas Bhàvanàkrama and the citations of these two verses from the Lanka­vatarasutra in Indian treatises such as Sàntaraksita’s Madhyamakàlamkàravrtti (D3885, fol. 79b.3-4), Kamalasllas Madhyamakâlamkârapanjikâ (D3886, fols. 128b.2-129a.3) and first Bhàvanàkrama (D3915, fol. 33a.3-33b.6), Jnânaklrtis Tattvàvatàra (D3709, fols. 63b.l-65a.2), and Ratnàkarasànti’s texts. In his translation of the sütra, Suzuki (1979, 247) says that most Sanskrit manuscripts have na (“not”), but that one has sa (“he”). Nanjios Sanskrit edition also has sa. Besides that, the main differences in these verses hinge on how one understands the two occurrences of “nonappearance.” Ka­malasilas detailed explanation of these verses in his Bhàvanàkrama (translation in Brunnhôlzl 2004, 300-302) takes the first “nonappearance” as referring to the cogni­tion that lacks the duality of apprehender and apprehended, and this cognition is to be transcended. The second one signifies the wisdom in which not even nondual wisdom appears, which is the path of seeing—the true seeing of the mahàyàna. This means that there is nothing to be seen when the light of perfect wisdom dawns through the exam­ination of all phenomena with the eye of prajna. However, such nonseeing of any phe­nomenon is not like being blind, closing ones eyes, or not mentally engaging in seeing. The Madhyamakâlamkârapanjikâ adds that it is through self-awareness in meditative equipoise that the yogin s mind is experienced as being nondual and without appearance and is described accordingly during subsequent attainment. Thus, though wisdom does not appear as something that can be referred to as nondual wisdom (or anything else, for that matter), since all phenomena lack a nature of their own, given Kamalaéïla’s mentioning of the light of wisdom and self-awareness, at least in terms of experiential events on the subject side, he does not seem to refer to a total lack of appearance of anything whatsoever in meditative equipoise. Ratnàkaraéàntis Prajnàpàramitopadesà (D4079, fols. 161a.5-162a.4) explains these verses according to the four yogas of focus­ing on (1) entities, (2) mere mind, (3) suchness, and (4) nonappearance. (1) The first yoga is taught implicitly—as long as one does not identify phenomena as such and such, one is not able to apprehend their emptiness either. (2) The second yoga refers to seeing these phenomena as being mere mind empty of apprehender and apprehended, which still entails appearance. (3) The third yoga means to apprehend the nonappearance of the characteristics of phenomena, viewing them as sheer lucidity. (4) The fourth yoga"},{"pageNumber":1230,"pageContent":"1214 Notesis the seeing by virtue of the nonappearance of any characteristics of both phenomena and the nature of phenomena. In more detail, “mere mind” in the first line of these two verses refers to the cognition of focusing on mere mind, which represents yoga (2). “Not imagine” means to go beyond yoga (1) of still imagining or examining external refer­ents. “The focal object of suchness” refers to yoga (3)—wisdoms focusing on suchness, with “having gone beyond mere mind” meaning to continue to train in this, while not yet having accomplished something previously nonexistent. Such an accomplishment is marked by “One must even go beyond nonappearance.” Here “nonappearance” means that the characteristics of phenomena do not appear, which means that one focuses on suchness alone. To go beyond even that is indicated by “the yogin who rests in nonap­pearance,” which refers to seeing that the characteristics of phenomena and the nature of phenomena do not appear at all. This means resting in yoga (4). “Mahâyàna” refers to the uncontaminated path of bodhisattvas superior to ¿râvakas and pratyekabuddhas. “Sees” means perceive directly because the wisdom at this stage is the mahâyàna. As for how one proceeds through this mahâyàna, who proceeds, and where to, the next verse in the Lankâvatârasütra (X.258) says:Peace is entered effortlessly,Purified through aspiration prayers.The highest identityless wisdom Sees the mahâyàna.As for how one proceeds, “effortlessly” means that one transits through the supramun- dane bhümis without exertion. These bhümis are “peace” because they lack afflictions and conceptions. “Purified through aspiration prayers” means that inferior forms of awakening are ruled out. As for who proceeds and to where, “identityless wisdom” is so because it is utterly without appearance. It is “the highest” because all obscura­tions, including their latent tendencies, are relinquished. This means the bodhicitta of a buddha, which will be seen by yogins of the mahâyàna. As mentioned above, Jnànakirtis Tattvàvatâra (P4532, fols. 70b.l-72a.6) explains X.256 in a rather standard way by matching it with the first three of the four yogic practices: (1) outer objects are observed to be nothing but mind, (2) thus, outer objects are not observed, and (3) with outer objects’ being unobservable, a mind cognizing them is not observed either. On X.257 (corresponding to (4) not observing both apprehender and apprehended, nonduality or suchness is observed), he comments that since suchness is unborn, it neither exists as an entity nor the lack of entity. This means that suchness is the com­plete lack of reference points, since entities and the lack of entity include all possible reference points. Through realizing that, all beings are understood as having the nature of the dharmakâya, thus going beyond the understanding of mere mind. The yogin must even transcend the state of true reality’s not appearing in the manner of being a unity or a multiplicity and the like. To fully rest in the nonappearance of any refer­ence points whatsoever is to realize true reality, here called “the mahâyàna,” another form of that name being “Mahâmudrâ.” Thus, Jnànakîrti indicates that the final re­alization of the freedom from reference points even in the mahâyàna of the sütras is nothing but Mahâmudrâ, which he further equates with the famous “nonseeing is the supreme seeing” in the prajnàpàramità sütras (he also clarifies that such nonseeing is of course not just the same mere absence of mental nonengagement as when being asleep or closing one’s eyes). Finally, compare Jamgon Kongtruls comments on these two verses in the text with the similar but expanded explanation by the late Nyingma master Düjom Rinpoche (Bdud ’joms ’jigs bral ye shes rdo rje 1991,183): “Accordingly, after Mind Only has been provisionally taught and then genuinely transcended, the"},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"Notes 1215apparitionless Madhyamaka is taught; and when that too has been transcended, the apparitional Madhyamaka is revealed. If that is not reached, it is said that the profound meaning of the greater vehicle is not perceived. It is, in general, erroneous to describe everything expressed by the word mind as the Mind Only doctrine, for there are occa­sions when the abiding nature free from all extremes, [known] inclusively as the nature of just what is, the genuine goal, the natural nirvana, the expanse of reality, the mind of inner radiance, and the intellect of Samantabhadra, is indicated by the word mind. ... One should not therefore mistake that which is spoken of as mind-as-such, the inner radiance transcending the mind of samsara and its mental events, for the Mind Only system, which does not transcend consciousness.” In general, many Tibetan texts cite the version quoted here in GISM (or variations of it) and comment accordingly. For example, see the Third Karmapa’s commentaries on the Dharmadhatustava (Brunn­holzl 2007b, 262) and the Dharmadharmatavibhaga (Brunnholzl 2012b, 263-64), as well as the Eighth Karmapa’s and the Fifth Shamarpa’s commentaries on the Abhisa- maydlamkara (Brunnholzl 2011b, 88 and 220).2681. As mentioned before, the phrase “has been obtained through the nature of phenom­ena since beginningless time” is found in the Bodhisattvabhumi (Wogihara ed., 3.4-6; D4037, fol. 2b!4) and in the Sravakabhumi (D4036, fol. 2a.2-3). It is also quoted in R G W on 1.86.2682. Uttaratantra 1.96/99-97/100.2683. Note that this feature among the buddha qualities does not appear in the Uttaratan­tra but is found as Mahavyutpatti no. 187, and in Abhidharmakosa VII.32d and Abhi- samaydlamkdra VIII.5a.2684. Uttaratantra 1.155/158 and II.5.2685. Uttaratantra 1.37-38.2686. The four notions of the basis of purification, what is to be purified, the means of pu­rification, and the result of purification represent a common hermeneutical set in the Buddhist tantras. Compare also R G W (J5; D4025, fol. 76b.2-3): “The buddha element is explained through a description of the sixty kinds of factors that purify its [natural] purity because it is [only] if the object to be purified is endowed with qualities that purifications of its purity are justified.”2687.

In accordance with R G W (DP) and Ut (D), GISM chos is emended to thob. Also, chos (“attributes”) is mentioned in the next line.2692. These are slight variations of Uttaratantra 1.3, III.l, IV. 1, and V.25.2693. This is a description of the outer, inner and “other” Kalacakra. However, usually, the outer Kalacakra refers to the outer universe (beginning with a four-continent world with Mount Meru and so on). The inner Kalacakra refers to the thirty-one levels of samsaric beings—the five realms of the desire realm below the gods, the six god realms of the desire realm, the sixteen god realms of the form realm, and the four god realms of the formless realm. The “other” Kalacakra refers to the mandala of the generation stage (utpattikrama) with its support (palace and so on) and supported (the deity), the nadls, vayus, and tilakas of the completion stage (sampannakrama), and so on.2694.

GISM presents this paragraph as two consecutive sentences, start­ing with “These sentient beings who teach ‘The tathâgata heart exists in all sentient beings’ are endowed with immeasurable qualities. That is, these sons ...”2705. The first sentence and the second one up through “the mahâyàna” represent an ab­breviated paraphrase of Mahâparinirvânasütra, D120, fol. 82b.l-3. I could not locate the remainder of the second sentence in the sütra.2706. Ibid., fol. 126a.6-7. GISM says, “If sons of good family . . . make efforts in under­standing by thinking, ‘The Tathâgata ...,’ just like me, they too should be regarded as the abode of a buddha.”2707. This means that people in India refrain from most activities during the hottest time of the day.2708. These are the four major ways of breaking the Buddhist monastic vows that are in common for both fully ordained monks and nuns—sexual misconduct, taking what was not given, killing, and pretending to possess spiritual realizations or attainments that one does not have. When committed in full, these four lead to the immediate loss of all other vows of ordination and expulsion from the ordained samgha. Fully or­dained nuns have to avoid four more defeating offenses, such as embracing or touching a man with a desirous mind.2709. Mahâparinirvânasütra, D120, fol. 126a.4-5 and 126b.3-5. GISM says, “For example, just as ... the sun shines, merely through hearing this sütra on the heart, the hosts of ... immediate consequence will swiftly be purified....

For if they did not have the naturally pure disposition, they would not thrive through the light rays of the wisdom of the tathagatas and virtuous dharmas. You may wonder, “Above it was explained that seeing samsara as a flaw and seeing nirvana as a quality does not occur in those with wrong craving, who have the disposition of absolutely not passing into nirvana. Is that not contradictory to the ex­planation in this sütra that [even] those with wrong craving generate virtue—the cause for meeting a buddha in the future?” It is not contradictory—the above [explanation pertains] to the time of those with wrong craving not being endowed with the four wheels.

The same passage is found in JKC (49-50), which adds that, according to Ngog Lotsawa, the perfect buddhakaya is the resultant tathagata heart, suchness is the natural tathagata heart, and the disposition is the causal tathagata heart. The dharmakaya is the actual tathagata, while it is only the nominal heart of sentient beings. It is explained to be all-pervading because it is suitable to be attained by sentient beings. Suchness is the actual heart of both tathagatas and sentient beings—in terms of the isolate of natural purity, suchness actually exists in both. Since the disposition is the cause of tathagatas, it is labeled as “tathagata heart,” but it is the actual heart of sentient beings.2749. Tibetan as quoted in Ruegg 1969, 291-92.2750.

In explaining the three reasons in Uttaratantra 1.28, Mipham Rinpoche and others join them with the Buddhist standard set of “the four principles” (Skt. yukti, Tib. rigs pa). The Sravakabhumi clarifies that yukti in the context of these four is equivalent to yoga and upaya, and R G W (J73) gives the same two synonyms for yukti in its discus­sion of the nature of phenomena being such a principle. Any of these three terms can mean “application,” “means,” and “expedient” (yet another way of understanding yukti here would be as “consistency” or coherence”). In answer to the question how one re­flects on the teaching about the skandhas by using a form of investigation that applies various principles, the Sravakabhumi (D4036, fol. 57b.2-58b.l) says that one investi­gates this teaching by means of the four principles. (1) The principle of dependence is twofold in terms of arising (Skt. utpattyapeksa, Tib. skye bai Itos pa) and in terms of designation (Skt. prajhaptyapeksa, Tib. gdags pa’i Itos pa), (a) Dependence in terms of arising means that the skandhas appear by virtue of causes and conditions and that their arising thus depends on these causes and conditions, (b) Dependence in terms of designation means that any designations of the skandhas depend on certain collections of names, words, and letters. These dependencies are principles or means or methods with regard to the arising and the designation of the skandhas. (2) The principle of performing activity is the principle or means or method of correlating the skandhas, which have arisen through their own individual causes and conditions, with the perfor­mance of their respective specific activities or functions, such as the eyes’ seeing visible forms, the ears’ hearing sounds, the mind’s cognizing phenomena, visible form’s func­tioning as the perceptible sphere of the eye, sound’s functioning as the perceptible sphere of the ears, and phenomena’s functioning as the perceptible sphere of the mind. In addition, there is the performance of specific activities through certain phenomena’s interacting with each other in certain ways. (3) The principle of demonstrating evi­dence means that the skandhas are investigated through the three kinds of valid cogni­tion that establish the skandhas as being impermanent, being dependency arisen, having the nature of suffering, being empty of a self, and not constituting a self. These three forms of valid cognition are trustworthy scripture, direct perception, and infer­ence. (4) The principle of the nature of phenomena is applied in response to questions such as, “Why do the skandhas have such a nature?” “Why does the arrangement of the world have that nature?” “Why does the earth element have the characteristic of hard­ness, the water element the characteristic of wetness, the fire element the characteristic of heat, and the wind element the characteristic of motility?” “Why are the skandhas impermanent?” “Why is nirvana a state of peace?” “Why does form have the character­istic of displaying the quality of form?” “Why do feelings have the characteristic of experiencing?” “Why do discriminations have the characteristic of causing phenomena to be discriminated?” “Why do formations have the characteristic of forming?” and “Why does consciousness have the characteristic of being conscious?” The fact that this is the very nature, essence, or dharmata of these phenomena is here the principle or"},{"pageNumber":1236,"pageContent":"1220 Notesmeans or method that is called “the principle of the nature of phenomena.” Alterna­tively, the principle that everything has its own nature or is based on its own nature is applied for the sake of settling the mind upon and making it understand that this is the way things are, that they are not some other way, that they do not become something other, and that they are this way everywhere and always. In this way, the four principles serve to properly investigate the teachings on the skandhas or any other teaching. The Abhidharmasatnuccaya (D4049, fol. 103a.3-5) basically agrees with this, saying that the four principles serve to analyze the dharma. (1) The principle of dependence is the fact that when formational or conditioned phenomena arise, they depend on conditions. (2) The principle of performing activity is that phenomena, which have different specific characteristics, perform their own specific activities. (3) The principle of demonstrat­ing evidence is to show that an established meaning does not contradict valid cognition. (4) The principle of the nature of phenomena refers to what are known since begin- ningless time as the individual natures of all phenomena that exhibit specific and gen­eral characteristics. The tenth chapter of the Samdhinirmocanasutra (D106, fols. 51a.3-52b.4) also agrees on the first three principles and further elaborates on the third one. (1) The principle of dependence refers to the causes and conditions for the arising of formational or conditioned phenomena and for designating them with conventional expressions. (2) The principle of performing activity refers to the causes and conditions that perform the functions of phenomena arising, being obtained, and being estab­lished. (3) The principle of demonstrating evidence refers to the causes and conditions for cognizing, explanation, establishing the meaning of statements, and thorough com­prehension. This is twofold—pure and impure. As for the five characteristics of the pure demonstration of evidence, (a) the characteristic of direct observation consists of the direct observation in the world that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, have the nature of suffering, and are without a self, as well as everything that accords with those, (b) The characteristic of directly observing what is based on something consists of the direct observation of the principle of impermanences being based on all conditioned phenomena’s being momentary, the existence of worlds beyond this one, and virtuous and nonvirtuous karmas’ not disappearing (without having produced their respective results); the direct observation of diverse sentient beings’ being based on their diverse karmas; the direct observation of the happiness and suffering of sen­tient beings’ being based on their virtuous and nonvirtuous karmas, respectively; what is not directly observed by these but is to be inferred; and everything that accords with those, (c) The characteristic of matching this with examples of their own type consists of matching it with examples of observing the disintegration and arising of inner and outer conditioned phenomena that is well known in the world; matching it with exam­ples of observing the suffering of being born and so on; matching it with examples of observing the lack of independence; matching it with examples of observing prosper­ing and deteriorating as they are well known in all worlds, even those beyond this one; and everything that accords with those, (d) The characteristic of thorough establish­ment is listed in order to fully ascertain that characteristics (a)-(c) apply to what is to be established, (e) The characteristic of teaching through determining utterly pure scrip­tures refers to the teachings by omniscient persons that nirvana is peace and so on as well as everything that accords with such teachings. Omniscient persons are character­ized by five features: when they appear in the world, they are renowned as being omni­scient; they possess the thirty-two marks of a great being; they eliminate the doubts of all sentient beings through the ten powers; by virtue of the four fearlessnesses, the words with which they teach the dharma cannot be disputed by any opponents; and in"},{"pageNumber":1237,"pageContent":"Notes 1221their vinaya teachings, the eightfold path of the noble ones and the fourfold practices of a ¿ramana (not scolding back even when being scolded, not becoming angry even when others are angry at one, not hitting back even when being hit, and not exposing hidden faults even when being exposed) appear. Thus, the principle of demonstrating evidence is pure due to these five characteristics by means of valid perception, valid inferential cognition, and the valid cognition of trustworthy scriptures. (4) The princi­ple of the nature of phenomena refers to the abiding of the dhatu of the nature of phenomena in order to make phenomena abide, no matter whether tathagatas appear or do not appear. GC (431.16-432.15) also explains these four based on this sutra.2786. VIII.l.2787. This is one of the ten powers of a buddha.2788. Madhyamakavatara XI. 11.2789. D107, fol. 9b.l-2.2790. Verse 22.2791.

The Sanskrit says “because it has the nature of inseparable pure dharmas” (avinir- bhágasuddhadharmaprakrtitvát).

This seems to be how Rongton understands hyang chub sems can yongs su ’dzin (Skt. bodeh sattvah parigrahah) in order to support his above statement that the nature of phenomena pervades all beings. However, as is clear from the context in the Uttaratantra, this line explains the phrase “taking hold” in IV.5 as referring to bodhi­sattvas as the ones who take hold of awakening.2848.

Here, Go Lotsawa correctly remarks that the Sanskrit atah is often rendered as ’di la (instead of ’di las) in the Tibetan translations as if it were a locative (seventh case) instead of being an ablative (fifth case).2852. A simple example of an “exclusion of possession by others” (Skt. anyayogavyavac- cheda, Tib. gzhan Idan mam gcod) would be “Only Susan is a good cook,” which ex­cludes that others too possess the feature of being a good cook. An example of an “exclusion of nonpossession” (Skt. ayogavyavaccheda, Tib. mi Idan mam gcod) would be the statement “Susan definitely is a good cook,” which excludes that she does not possess the feature of being a good cook.2853. J76-77.2854. As above, GC glosses *di la(s) in 1.154a as de’i phyir.2855. As will be clear from what follows, here GC takes Skt. nimitta (Tib. rgyu mtshan) to mean “cause” and not “characteristic.” The same goes for this term in relation to puri­fied phenomena in the text below.2856. Here, ’di la in 1.154a is taken literally.2857. This is how Go Lotsawa wants Skt. prabhavitandm (Tib. rab tu phye ba) to be un­derstood here.2858. D3791, fols. 58b.7-59a.l.2859.

D3796, fol. 81a.7-81b.5.2878. XI.29. The Mahdydnasutrdlamkdrabhasya explains that remedial phenomena are like an illusory king due to their sovereignty in terms of purifying afflicted phenomena. Af­flicted phenomena are also like an illusory king due to their sovereignty in terms of producing more afflicted phenomena. Thus, the defeat of afflicted phenomena by reme­dial phenomena is like one illusory king’s being defeated by another illusory king. Since bodhisattvas know this, they are without any pride about either one of these two sides.2879. D3799, fol. 244b.3-6.2880. D3801, fol. 181a.5-7.2881. D3803, fols. 183b.6-184a.l.2882.
