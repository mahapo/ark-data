I highly recommend this book forstudents who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the complete path toenlightenment.”—Orgyen Chowang RinpocheABOUT THE BOOKIn 1838, Choying Tobden Dorje, a Buddhist yogi-scholar of eastern Tibet,completed a multivolume masterwork that traces the entire path of the Nyingmatradition of Tibetan Buddhism from beginning to end. Written by a laypractitioner for laypeople, it was intended to be accessible, informative,inspirational, and above all, practical. Its twenty-five books, or topicaldivisions, offer a comprehensive and detailed view of the Buddhist pathaccording to the early translation school of Tibetan Buddhism, spanning the vastrange of Buddhist teachings from the initial steps to the highest esotericteachings of great perfection. Choying Tobden Dorje’s magnum opus appears inEnglish here for the first time.In Foundations of the Buddhist Path, which covers the first ten of thetreatise’s twenty-five books, the author surveys the scope of the entire workand then begins with the topics that set the cornerstones for all subsequentBuddhist practice: what constitutes proper spiritual apprenticeship, how toreceive the teachings, how to make the best use of this life, and how tomotivate ourselves to generate effort on the spiritual path. He then describesrefuge and the vows that define the path of individual liberation before turningto the bodhisattva’s way—buddha nature, how to uplift the mind to supremeawakening, the bodhisattva’s training, and the attainments of the paths leadingto supreme awakening.CHOYING TOBDEN DORJE (1787–1848) was a brilliant Vajrayana master of easternTibet. His masterwork, The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra,remains the main text studied by Tibet’s Ngakpa lineages of lay Buddhistyogi-practitioners.

In clear and concise language, this text synthesizes the very vastand extremely profound essence of the five major subjects of Tibetan culture.Like a magical tree that answers your prayers, this book provides whateverinformation you might wish to know among those fields of knowledge.On this occasion of the publication of the root text and outline of this work, Iwill introduce it using the widely accepted five-point model of initiating adiscussion of any treatise. As is said,What is the title of this text?For whom was it written?Who is the author?How long is this work?What is its purpose?In keeping with this general custom, I will answer these questions to introducethis treatise, the subject of this preface.First, this text’s title, The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses andTantras, refers to the central, or “root,” text. A compilation of the headingsfound within the text, its outline, is entitled The Wish-Fulfilling Vine.Second, for which disciples or for what readers was this treatise written? Forthose individuals interested in fields of knowledge outside the secular realm,this excellent text elucidates the nondual inspiration of enlightened beings;the pith instructions taught by Buddhist scholars, accomplished masters, adeptsimmersed in nondual awareness, and holy spiritual masters; and the majorsubjects of Buddhist culture. It provides an outline of the basis, paths, andresults of the ways of spiritual development presented in Buddhist discoursesand tantras. It traces the successive vows and bonds accepted in the disciplineof individual liberation, the training of bodhisattvas, and the path of secretmantra. It offers edifying conclusions based on the author’s own reasoning drawnfrom his hearing the Buddhist doctrine and having reflected and meditated uponit.The composition of the words and the meanings of this treatise is superb: itsillumination and illustration of the entire range of Buddhist ways of spiritualdevelopment lack nothing and are error-free. It resembles a treasure ofinvaluable wealth. It holds the complete three-part classical literary format ofan introduction, main text, and conclusion. The subjects of this text areelucidated by a brief presentation and an extensive explanation. Relevantgeneral and specific headings supply clear demarcations among it subjects. Theroot text is concise: it is written in verse to facilitate memorization. Theextensive commentary in prose enables understanding of the subjects’ deepermeanings. The authority provided by supportive quotations from scripture elicitsthe reader’s confidence beyond any doubt. In turn, the presentations provided inthe concise commentary and the illustrations make the subjects of this treatiseincreasingly perceivable.In the Earth Dog year of the fourteenth 60-year cycle (1838 in the generalcalendar), Longchen Chöying Tobden Dorje wrote this root text and itscommentaries.Third, who is this author? The author of the root text The Invaluable Treasuryof Buddhist Discourses and Tantras and its commentaries is Longchen ChoyingTobden Dorje Mapam Choklé Nampar Gyalwa. He was born in the Wood Snake year ofthe thirteenth 60-year cycle (1785 in the common calendar) in the region ofRepkong, lower Amdo. He began his composition of this treatise at the age offifty-one, in the Fire Monkey year of the fourteenth 60-year cycle (1836 in thecommon calendar), and completed it at the age of fifty-three, in the Earth Dogyear (1838). Apart from this information, which is explicitly stated in thecolophon of this text, no other account of his life has come into our hands.That being the case, we have been unable to conduct any detailed research intohis birthplace, his life work, his responsibilities, his residence in lowerAmdo, or the time of this work’s original publication. We are therefore unableto trace the present legacy of his major or minor acts and we ask those whopublish further portions of this treatise in the future to strive to fill thesegaps in our knowledge.Fourth, how long is the root text of The Invaluable Treasury of BuddhistDiscourses and Tantras? The content spans definitive versions of subjectsbeginning with discipleship and ending with the stages of the result of theBuddhist path, consummate accomplishment. The body of the treatise divides thestages of Buddhist ways of spiritual development into twenty-five books, whichcontain one hundred general chapters and two thousand, one hundred andseventy-nine specific headings. Concerning the length of the words used toexpress that content, within the root text the initial virtue of the treatise(its introduction) and its concluding virtue (the conclusion) are composed ofverses of thirteen syllables each, whereas the continuing virtue of the maintext is composed of verses of nine syllables each. In all, the text containsnine hundred and eighty four verses, definitely divided into three sections.Apart from this root text, the contents of the outline, concise commentary,extensive commentary, and illustrations are fashioned in prose. The measure ofthe root text and its commentaries is definitely equal to the number ofmountains.Fifth, for what purpose was this work composed? It will prove useful foreveryone, be they of sublime or ordinary acumen: it will accomplish what theydesire, both for the short and long term. Study of this text leads to theresolution of outer misconceptions and the attainment of the rank of a learnedperson. Meditation on this text resolves inner misconceptions and the manifestattainment of the spiritual goals that each of us wishes for. Such is thepurpose for which this work was composed.We will gradually publish the root text The Invaluable Treasury of BuddhistDiscourses and Tantras along with its commentaries and illustrated version forthe purpose of providing a single text that will satisfy a hundred avenues ofresearch for those who, in general, strive for knowledge of the nature of thingsas well as knowledge of their infinite diversity and more specifically engage indetailed investigations of Tibetan culture. That said, this is not our onlymotivating concern: the entirety of the root text and commentaries of thistreatise was previously printed from wood blocks in the region of Amdo, yet thatpublication did not have a significant lasting impact since in the midst oflater various turbulent events in the Lake Kokonor (Qinghai) area, the woodblocks themselves disappeared without a trace. Therefore, in the present timeonly one or two copies of the original texts of the root text and itscommentaries have survived: the continued existence of these texts isendangered. Thus it seems surely necessary to act swiftly to preserve thesetexts by publishing books that replicate exactly the content of their originaledition. In the present case, we now publish the root text and the outline withthe plan to gradually publish the entire series of texts of this collection. Thesublime individual Tübten Nyima, Zenkar Rinpoche, in his inspired vision topreserve Tibetan culture, has gladly lent us the original copies of the texts.Further, he has graciously given his guidance to assure the success of ourpublications. On this occasion of the first in the series, we must offer him ourdeepest gratitude.Nor-drang Orgyan, editorAugust 15, 1986Nor-drang Orgyan is a renowned scholar who now lives in retirement. His magnumopus is the three-volume Compendium of Buddhist Numeric Terms, published in2008. Formerly he served as director of the Academy of Social Sciences of theTibet Autonomous Region and the Rare Texts Publishing House."},{"pageContent":"A BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR, CHOYING TOBDEN DORJE [05_toc-title.html#head_2]image [images/chapline.jpg]THE SOVEREIGN TRIUMPHANT Buddha Lake-Born Vajra (Guru Rinpoche) demonstrated thedisplay of human rebirth as the leader of learned and accomplished masters,Longchen Choying Tobden Dorje Mapam Choklé Nampar Gyalwa Pal-zangpo. Thissublime individual was born in the Wood Snake year of the thirteenth 60-yearcycle (1785 in the common calendar) in Zho Pong, a place located in the goldenprovince of Repkong, itself situated in the Himalayan region of lower Amdo. Hewas born to a father named Rinchen and a mother who was the dance of anemanation of Yeshé Tsogyal, named Lady Yeshé Drolma. She was also known by thename of Gyal-yum Ngödrup Drolma. Their child was first known by the name GongpoYönten.From the time of his infancy, he naturally presented himself as having thecharacter of a holy person. Many lamas, reincarnate masters, and spiritualguides of his homeland taught him to read and write, and then to apply himselfdiligently to Buddhist practice and to training in the subjects of Buddhistculture. As a result, the vault of his talents overflowed.As the sovereign bodhisattva All-Seeing Eyes in human form, Kalden Gyatso,states:The illustrious master from Oddiyana, Lotus Born,Journeyed to the Himalayan region of Tibet.Here, in general, he inaugurated countless sites sacred to the dakinisAnd specifically sent forth hundreds of emanations of himself simultaneously.They opened the gateways to hundreds of palaces of the dakinis,Including the major sacred place of Nya-gong White Cliff in the eastAnd the crystal hermitage of Né Chuchik,Where they bound worldly gods and demons under oath.In past times, during the original spread of Buddhism in Amdo,The fine names of Repkong’s eight sacred sites of spiritual accomplishmentWere as well-known as are the sun and moon.He again states,Moreover, one by the name of Kawa Dorjé Wang,A sublime mantra adept from Katok Monastery in the east,Arrived in this sacred place of the crystal hermitage and attained a body madeof rainbow light.As these praises of this place mention, among Repkong’s eight sacred sites ofspiritual accomplishment appears one by the name of the crystal hermitage of thePalace of Supreme Bliss, commonly known as the crystal hermitage of Né Chuchik.Choying Tobden Dorje joined the spiritual community living there and acceptedthe three successive levels of vows—individual liberation, bodhisattva, andsecret mantra. He listened to, reflected upon, and cultivated his experience inthe profound and vast spiritual instructions of the original Nyingma traditionsbased upon the canon, treasure texts, and visionary revelation. Following this,he went to the sublime site of the Buddha’s Word as Profound Instruction(Kadampa) doctrine, the Ragya Monastery named Ganden Tashi Jung-né ShédrupDargyé Ling. There, he sat at the feet of many spiritual guides, such asShing-za Pandit Lozang Dargyé Gyatso. For a period of five years he assumed thelifestyle of an ordinary monk without family ties as he heard and reflected uponthe three collections of Buddhist scripture and cultivated his experience on thespiritual path of the three aspects of Buddhist training. At the end of thisperiod of his life, he left to practice meditation in mountain hermitageswithout settling down in a fixed residence.At some point, predictions made by wisdom deities and spiritual masters inspiredhim to search for his personal lord of enlightenment’s wisdom clans, just as thetriumphant buddhas’ spiritual heir, a bodhisattva named Always Weeping, soughtout his master named Noble Qualities. Choying Tobden Dorje’s heart gave birth toa consuming desire to receive the profound instructions that would propel him ina single lifetime, in that very rebirth, to the level of the original lordprotector Buddha Ever Excellent. He traveled southward and arrived at suchplaces as Dzokchen Monastery, where from the fourth Dzokchen Tulku MingyurNamkha Dorjé and from Jé-ön Péma Kundrol he received the empowerments thatspiritually ripen the recipient and guidance in meditation that leads toliberation, based on an ocean of instructions from the discourses and tantras.Most notably, Choying Tobden Dorje traveled to and stayed for a long time in theBuddhist encampment led by Dodrupchen Rinpoche, Jigmé Trinlé Özer. ChoyingTobden Dorje relied on Drupchen Rinpoche as his personal lord of enlightenment’swisdom clans and delighted him in the three ways of pleasing one’s spiritualmaster. As if pouring the contents of one vase into another, this lama bestowedsuch instructions as the general profound teachings from Buddhist discourses andtantras, and especially, the empowerments that bring spiritual maturity withinthe inner three yoga tantras, guidance in meditation that leads to liberation,and supportive reading transmissions of scripture. As a result, Choying TobdenDorje gained mastery within the outlook that sees the nature of reality: withinhim, the wisdom that arises on the path of no further training became perfectlyevident.The sublime lama, lord of enlightenment’s wisdom clans, knew that Choying TobdenDorje would in the future become an illustrious guide for disciples and that hehad a karmic connection with specific deities. Thus Dodrupchen Rinpoche grantedhim many profound wrathful mantra practices from the original translationtradition, including the deep crucial instructions for the four penetrations ofthe glorious supreme wisdom deity Vajra Youth; the cycle of the wisdom deitySlayer of the Lord of Death, including the four wheels of Gentle Splendor; theoverturning of ominous signs using the wisdom deity Mamo Who Casts Spells; andmany profound instructions in the mantra practice of fire rituals, which includesuppression, incineration, and sending projectiles—activity that leads toenlightenment. Choying Tobden Dorje meditated on these: the mass of all hisdualistic thoughts emptied into the infinite expanse of the display of wisdomdeities, mantras, and nondual wisdom. He gained supreme, uninhibited confidencein the performance of overt wrathful activity.Then the noble spiritual master Dodrupchen Rinpoche made the followingdeclaration, “This northern black mantra adept, like a meteorite dagger, is thedesignated inheritor of an ocean of wrathful mantras. I name him LongchenChoying Tobden Dorje Mapam Choklé Nampar Gyalwa.” To the transmission of thisuplifting praise and many predictions of the future, he added, “Your realizationhas freed your own stream of being: now is the time for you to employ nondualcompassion to liberate others’ stream of being. Return to your homeland and carefor a community of disciples. You will have a healing effect on the Buddhistdoctrine and for sentient beings, and your service to beings will continuallyflourish.”As advised, Choying Tobden Dorje journeyed to Repkong, where he engaged in thespiritual practice of the protector Lord of Power, which caused his wealth andcircle of disciples to significantly swell. In his homeland, he founded KohudéMonastery, known as Dzokchen Namgyal Ling, which has since been sustained by hisseries of reincarnations. In the present day, the details of the monastery’slife, such as ritual traditions, appear to follow the customs of Mindrol LingMonastery.Further on the subject of Dodrupchen Rinpoche and Choying Tobden Dorje, atreasure text predicts,In the east, a white conch shell will appear with the resounding voice ofBrahma.In the south will appear a white fruit, a circular fort like a mound.In the west will appear one like a blossoming orange lotus.In the north will appear one with force and might like a planted dagger.As this passage reveals, Dodrup Rinpoche’s heart spiritual children were the“four major roof beams.” Among these, in the north, the fine name of ChoyingTobden Dorje resounds beautifully in all directions like summer drums ofthunder. With the activity of a learned scholar, he taught, debated, andcomposed texts, and with the enlightened activity of a mantra adept thatpacifies, enhances, magnetizes, and overpowers, he took countless numbers ofdisciples under his care, subduing them in a manner suitable to each and placingthem on the tantric path of spiritual maturity and liberation. In general, hisprodigious acts sustained the triumphant buddhas’ doctrine impartially; inparticular, he ensured that the precious teachings of the original translations’Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse continue without deterioration to the boundsof time and space. The line of disciples from this master and from PalchenNamkha Jigmé are known as the “nineteen hundred black mantra adepts of Repkongwho wield daggers.” The continuity of their doctrine forms an incomparableenclosure of iron mountains that protects the teachings, a fact that is evidentto the present day.In the Iron Ox year of the fourteenth 60-year cycle (1841 in the commoncalendar), Shabkar Tsok-druk Rangdrol sent a letter of request to Choying TobdenDorje on the occasion of the lunar new year celebration. Choying Tobden Dorjesent a letter in reply and during that year he offered Shabkar Rinpoche anextensive reading transmission and instruction in the root text, The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, and its commentaries. Thisinformation is recorded in Shabkar’s autobiography. At that time, Choying TobdenDorje was fifty-six years old, whereas Shabkar Rinpoche had reached sixty.The above clear account amounts to a mere indication of his life story,transcribed from relevant portions of A History of Buddhism in Lower Amdo, TheStory of the Monastic Seat of the Major Hermitage of Rongpo, The Autobiographyof Shabkar Tsok-druk Rangdrol, and A History of the Vital Essence of Luminosity.To add to these sources, I traveled to Kohudé Monastery to compile whatever Icould see or hear, or find in research documents, to fill out the details ofthis account. Nevertheless, I was unable to discover even how long ChoyingTobden Dorje appeared to live in the perception of his disciples in this worldlyrealm, or even the seed of a full, detailed account of how he sustained hisenlightened activities in teaching, meditation practice, and altruistic acts.Although that consists of my report, Shabkar Tsok-druk Rangdrol’s letter sent toChoying Tobden Dorje in the Iron Ox year of the Finest Mind (the name of thefourteenth 60-year cycle) supplies a condensed version of the heart of thissublime master’s biography from which we are able to infer some of theinformation we seek. Therefore, I include the entire letter here; TheAutobiography of Shabkar Tsok-druk Rangdrol states:Further, I examined the excellent explanations composed on general subjects bythe venerable precious master of great perfection [that is, Choying TobdenDorje], in whom both scholastic and meditative accomplishments are gathered, andin particular, I read the major treatise The Complete Nyingma Tradition fromSutra to Tantra. I was moved to stable, inviolable faith in him. At the NewYear, I wrote him this letter:May the wisdom deities of longevity—Lord Protector Boundless Life, White Tara, and the rest—Who grant sublime longevityBestow upon you the spiritual accomplishment of life without end, I pray.The emanation of the wisdom mindOf buddhas of all times and directions is the Lord of Oddiyana, Guru Rinpoche,Who has once again appeared in your form in which both learning and spiritualaccomplishment have gathered:Sublime individual who sustains this appearance, please consider me.Lord protector, in times past you attained enlightenment,Yet in later generations for the disciples you accept,You demonstrate a life of spiritual liberationOnly in order to show them how enlightenment can be won.In your early life, you cast from your mind any thought of this lifeAnd dwelled at the lotus feet of many learned and accomplished masters.You received pith instructions and profound advice in the Buddhist discoursesand tantras,And resolved outer misconceptions through the process of listening to andreflecting upon them.Later, in seclusion in mountain hermitagesYou meditated to resolve inner misconceptions:The vault of the qualities of spiritual experience and realization overflowedwithin you.You followed the predictive advice of spiritual masters and wisdom deitiesAnd responded to the entreaties of your fortunate disciples:You granted empowerments, reading transmissions, guidance in meditation, and soon,Teaching, debating, and writing day and nightTo spread sublime helpful acts and happiness in the Buddhist doctrine and amongbeings.The word of the leader of the teachings, the mighty Buddha Shakyamuni,And others among the triumphant buddhas in infinite numbers dwelling in the tendirectionsSpans the vast discoursesAnd oceans of profound tantras.Their innermost essence; the crucial points found in treatises written byvarious scholarsIn commentary upon the Victor’s word;Guidance based on spiritual experience of the customs of lineagesFounded by supreme individuals who preserve the doctrine;Traditional styles of teaching based upon learned persons’ systems of thought;The basis, paths, and results of the ways of the discourses and tantras;The trio of the view, meditation, and conduct; the three levels of vows;The five major and five minor subjects of Buddhist culture:The clear meanings found within this entire range of ways of spiritualdevelopment—Complete and error-free—are all found in this vault of excellent explanations,Like a storehouse of jewels,The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra.You have written this for the doctrine and beings in general to provide themwith easy skillful spiritual techniquesAnd especially to help fortunate individualsOf the present and of times yet to come:How very kind you are!Spiritual master infused with such supreme kindness,To you I bow in utmost humility.With masses of offerings, both real and imagined, I present gifts to you.I divulge any wrongdoing of having regarded you with wrong views or lack offaith.I rejoice in your sublime life lived in spiritual liberation.Continue to turn the wheel of the teachings, I pray.I beseech you to live for a hundred yearsAnd I dedicate my stores of ennobling acts to ensure your lotus feet remainfirmly upon this earth.Spiritual master, may your health be excellent, splendidly bright.May you live long in supreme well-being.Spiritual master, may the renown of your goodness spread;And especially, may your intended goals meet with success.May the wealth of your teachings’ sponsors flourishAnd may your doctrine long remain in this world.When I meet you and all those around you, the event I wish for,May the auspicious circumstances arise for our repeated meeting.In the enjoyment of jubilant happinessMay we all delight in the auspicious circumstances conducive to the practice ofBuddhism.I offered this letter accompanied by a physical representation of myintentions—pills made at the conclusion of my practice of longevity—and a giftof divine silk embroidered with the wisdom deities of longevity.So Shabkar Rinpoche wrote.It is said that the collection of treatises written by this noble spiritualmaster Choying Tobden Dorje includes such texts as The Final Act of Suppression,the Black Supreme Mountain, part of his cycle on the practical application ofwrathful mantras. The chief treatise among his books is entitled The CompleteNyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, a work that elucidates all ways ofspiritual development. Thirteen large volumes comprise this treatise. He beganits composition in the Fire Monkey year of the Finest Mind, the fourteenth60-year cycle (1836 in the common calendar), and successfully completed it atthe age of fifty-three, in the Earth Dog year (1838).This treatise is composed of five parts: a root text, an outline, a concisecommentary, an extensive commentary, and an illustrated version. The root textis written in verse whereas the other texts are rendered in prose or indrawings. In the first of the thirteen volumes, indicated by the Tibetan letterKa, we find the root text and the outline. In the second volume, indicated bythe Tibetan letter Kha, we find the concise commentary. In the next ninevolumes, from the third (Ga) to the eleventh (Da), we find the extensivecommentary. Of these nine, the discourses are contained within two volumes, aformer and a latter. The subjects of study are also contained within twovolumes, a former and a latter. The tantras are also contained within twovolumes, a former and a latter. Great perfection is contained within threevolumes, a former, a middle, and a latter one. In the twelfth volume (Na) andthe thirteenth (Pa), we find the entire range of subjects of the main textrepresented by illustrations.Woodblocks of this treatise existed but in 1937 bandits of the Ma warlord clanintentionally destroyed them. Nevertheless, later, the sublime reincarnatemaster Tübten Nyima, who deeply values the traditional texts of Tibetan culture,and others of like mind, searched for, collected, and prepared this edition,which we are now able to publish.Respectfully written by the one called Nor-de, an invalid and an ignorant foolfrom the land of Golok. May excellent fortune flourish!This biography is included in the 2000 edition of The Complete Nyingma Traditionfrom Sutra to Tantra printed by the Sichuan Nationalities’ Publishing House. Itsauthor, Nor-de, is a well-known writer and editor who has served as head of theNational People’s Congress Bureau of Golok Prefecture, Qinghai Province."},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD TO THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION OFThe Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra [05_toc-title.html#head_3]image [images/chapline.jpg]AMONG THE FOUR heart spiritual children of Dodrupchen Jigmé Trinlé Özer, the“four major vajra roof beams,” the one to the north, like a meteorite daggerplanted in the ground, is known as Dzokchen Choying Tobden Dorje. This supremelord of splendid renown was born in the Pön-ru clan, child of a father Rinchenand a mother Ngödrup Drolma, in the Wood Snake year of the thirteenth 60-yearcycle (1785 in the common calendar), in Zho Pong, a place in Repkong, lowerAmdo. From an early age, he joined a spiritual community close to hisbirthplace, that of the crystal hermitage of the Palace of Supreme Bliss. There,he learned without difficulty the forms of the letters, as well as to read andwrite, and such subjects as composition. From Waka Tsering, secretary to theBuddhist King Ngak-gi Wangpo, he learned other Tibetan scripts, history, andother topics among the common subjects of secular culture which he mastered.After meeting Shing-za Pandit Lozang Dargyé Gyatso at Ragya Monastery, GandenTashi Jung-né, he applied himself to training in the entire ten fields ofBuddhist culture.Then Choying Tobden Dorje mentally deserted any splendor appearing in this lifeand met the lord of spiritual accomplishment Péma Rangdrol, who had journeyed toRepkong to spiritually aid sentient beings. Choying Tobden Dorje served asattendant while that lama devoted himself for a number of years to the essenceof spiritual practice in retreat at the uppermost peak of the White Cliff atTsang-gö Dzong. Choying Tobden Dorje and the lord of spiritual accomplishmentKalden Rangdrol made a pair of whom the sublime master Nyang-kyé Nang-dzé Dorjésaid fulfilled a prediction made centuries before by the great master immersedin nondual awareness Rigdzin Palden Tashi:At the retreat place at the uppermost peak of White Cliff,The three birds, a mother [that is, Péma Rangdrol] and two children, willgather.It was in those circumstances that Choying Tobden Dorje received from the lordof spiritual accomplishment Péma Rangdrol treasure teachings revealed by KunzangDéchen Gyalpo: the general collection of doctrines named The Innermost SecretWish-fulfilling Horse and Pig. Specifically, he perfected the practice ofmeditation in stages from the initial mental training in the outer and innerpreliminary practices to the main practice—profound guidance in greatperfection. The nondual inspiration of the nature of reality, the union ofawareness and emptiness, was born in Choying Tobden Dorje’s wisdom mind. Thisperiod coincided with the lifetime of the third incarnation of Rigdzin PaldenTashi, king of secret mantra in Repkong; in his next lifetime, that master wasreborn as the mantra adept Dorjé Namgyal, who became the father of the lord ofscholars Gendun Chöpel.Choying Tobden Dorje then traveled to Kham, to Dzokchen Monastery Orgyen SamtenChöling, where he arrived in the presence of many learned and accomplishedmasters, including Dzokchen Tulku Mingyur Namkha Dorjé and Jé-ön Péma KundrolNamgyal. He listened to and trained in the general teachings of Buddhistdiscourses and secret mantra, and voraciously drank from the canon’s andtreasures’ rivers of nectar of ripening empowerments and liberatinginstructions. In particular at that time, Dodrup Kunzang Shenpen lived in theRudam Shinjé meditation cave; from him, Choying Tobden Dorje received theearlier and later Heart Essence cycles and many other tantras, readingtransmissions, and pith instructions from the vajra way. Later, when DodrupchenRinpoche lived in the Do-kok, Choying Tobden Dorje went to see him repeatedlyand received such transmissions as The Magical Illusion Secret Essence Tantra,The Trilogy of Rest in the True Nature, and The Highest Wisdom of GreatPerfection.In the Earth Tiger year of the fourteenth 60-year cycle (1828 in the commoncalendar), in Repkong’s Kohudé Valley, Choying Tobden Dorje founded themonastery of Dzokchen Namgyal Ling and cared for infinite numbers of disciples,such as those known as the twenty-one great perfection lamas, includingShar-dakpa Rabjampa, Bong-tak Marik Munsel, and Rigdzin Hung-nak Mébar. Further,Dodrup Rinpoche once remarked that the auspicious conditions existed for theabbot, master, and Buddhist king to gather in the same household. As that lamapredicted, Choying Tobden Dorje accepted the dakini Kunga Chödrön as his consortwho embodied nondual awareness. To them were born two sons: the omniscientmaster Tenpé Nyima, an emanation of the great abbot Shantirakshita; and therealized master Tenpé Gyaltsen, an emanation of King Trisong Déu-tsen. ChoyingTobden Dorje himself was without mistake an emanation of Guru Rinpoche. Thus wasthe prophecy fulfilled. Likewise, based on the timely ripening of the superbaspirations of three masters—Choying Tobden Dorje, Dola Jigmé Kalzang ChoyingDorje, and Khamla Namkha Gyatso—a large community appeared called RepkongLongchen Ngak-mang, where masters immersed in nondual awareness gathered.The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra is the main work amongChoying Tobden Dorje’s compositions that were said to fill close to twentyvolumes. His writings included an autobiography, a collection of his songs ofspiritual realization, and a cycle on practical instructions in the practice ofwrathful mantras. Nevertheless, some of those very important books vanished,with only their titles remaining, in the midst of turbulent times. Apart fromThe Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, the remaining books amonghis written work have been published by the Qinghai Ngak-mang Research Institutein two volumes: The Guide to Great Perfection of the Cycle of The InnermostSecret Wish-fulfilling Horse and Pig and A Collection of Assorted Works byDzokchen Choying Tobden Dorje. These two were printed separately, in 2006 and2010, through the auspices of the People’s Press in Beijing.On the subject of The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, itcontains the essence of the realization expressed in oceans of discourses andtantras delivered by infinite numbers of triumphant buddhas who dwell in the tendirections; the commentaries to the canon written by many Indian and Tibetanlearned and accomplished masters who illuminate the doctrine; guidance inpractical procedures based in meditative experience from the lineages ofaccomplished masters, supreme individuals who preserve the doctrine; traditionalstyles of teaching based upon various learned persons’ systems of thought; anoutline of the basis, paths, and results of the ways of the discourses andsecret mantra; classifications of the trio of the view, meditation, and conduct;the stages of the vows and bonds within the three successive levels ofvows—individual liberation, bodhisattva, and secret mantra; and explanations ofthe major subjects of Buddhist culture. In this work, nothing is lacking; such aholy text of excellent explanations is unprecedented.Concerning this work, the sublime, venerable master Dodrup Rinpoche made thistimely prediction:At first, you cast from your mind any thought concerned with this life and inseclusion applied yourself with intense diligence to three activities: hearing,reflecting, and meditating on the teachings. You thereby trained well your ownstream of being. Then you brought others to spiritual maturity and liberationthrough three activities: teaching, debate, and composition. Finally, your threeactivities of understanding, meditative experience, and realization causewide-ranging altruistic acts and happiness to flourish for the Buddhist doctrineand sentient beings. Now, for the sake of fortunate persons of the present andthe time yet to come, you must write an auspicious text that gathers words thatarticulate meditative experience; is accessible throughout its length; uses theview to define the abiding nature of all phenomena of the round of rebirth,transcendent states, and the spiritual path; can be used in meditation tocultivate spiritual experience; enriches that experience through conduct; and isinfused with powerful blessings.At the time this prediction came true, Tsering Döndrup Pal-zangpo, a Buddhistking who preserved the doctrine and ruled the region of Lake Kokonor (Qinghai),encouraged Choying Tobden Dorje to compose the work, and promised to sponsor itsprinting and to aid the precious Buddhist doctrine. Due to this and otherauspicious related events, he began his writing in the Fire Monkey year of thefourteenth 60-year cycle (1836 in the common calendar), and completed it withincontinued excellent fortunate circumstances in the Earth Dog year.The root text, The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, iscomposed in verse; a separate outline presents the framework of the treatise;the concise commentary is written in prose; the extensive commentary isaccompanied by supportive quotations from scripture; and the illustrated versionsupplies a very vivid presentation of the material. Thus, the whole workcontains five major divisions. These cover thirteen precious volumes, which havethree parts: an introduction, a main text, and a conclusion. These in turncontain twenty-five books; one thousand, one hundred and seventy-nine specificheadings; and eighty separate texts, a number equal to the Buddha’s signs ofphysical perfection.Among the heart spiritual children of Dodrupchen Rinpoche, the four vajra roofbeams, Jigmé Kalzang Chöying Dorjé was the eastern white conch shell whoappeared with a resounding voice like Brahma’s. His reincarnation, who lived inthe Repkong area, was Dzong-ngön Péma Tükchok Dorjé. He praised The CompleteNyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra in these words:Its root text in verse facilitates memorization.Its quotes from authoritative holy scriptures foster trust beyond any doubt.The clarity of its extensive commentary makes it easy for the reader tocomprehend the intended meaning.The vast ground of the work can be distinguished by the general and specificheadings.This excellent text imbued with these four special qualities Gathers theentirety of the essential crucial pointsOf commentaries to oceans of Buddhist discourses and tantras in general.Most notably, it is infused with the unchanging meaning of the six milliontantrasOf the spiritual path at the summit of Buddhist ways, atiyoga, the utmostwelcome of the genuine state.The profound and multifaceted essential contents of this invaluable treasury,An unprecedented treatise sealed with the seven possessions of a universalmonarch,Are resplendent—it lacks nothing and is error-free, accessible, and systematic.He thereby clearly elucidated the unusual, special qualities of this treatise.Upon the completed composition of this treatise, Tsering Döndrup, ruler of theLake Kokonor region, Qinghai; Choying Tobden Dorje’s mother, Ngödrup Drolma; hisson, the omniscient master Tenpé Nyima; his disciples Kunpang Gendün Palden,A-tsok Lektsok Gyatso, Lama Marik Munsel, and Lama Dorjé Sherab; and, likewise,his sponsors with their circle collected the funds necessary to sponsor theoriginal carving of the woodblocks of the treatise. From that point on, theseindividuals fostered the continuity of its reading transmission, teaching, andstudy. As for the sections concerning The Secret Essence Tantra and the cycle ofgreat perfection within the extensive commentary (itself entitled The ElegantOrnament of the Age of Great Brahma), the woodblocks for their printing werecarved much later. The words of aspiration contained in the dedication of thefirst edition made from them clearly indicate that it dates from the WaterRabbit year of the fifteenth 60-year cycle (1903 in the common calendar). Thus,the complete set of woodblocks for the thirteen volumes of The Complete NyingmaTradition from Sutra to Tantra were invited to reside at the monastic seat ofDzokchen Namgyal Ling. Then, thirty-five years later, in March, 1938, themisguided policy of the then-ruler of Qinghai made those original woodblocksdisappear as they were fed to the outer element of fire. Further, during theCultural Revolution, even the continuity of the teaching of this treatise in theRepkong area was stopped. These are tragedies.In the 1980s, the hopes of a few masterful scholars of two branches of theCommittee of the Sichuan Province People’s Agency—the Office of Rare Texts andthe People’s Research Center—spurred the search for, collection of, andpreparation for printing of The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra.The National Committee of the Chinese People’s Agency in turn initiated anationwide project to restore rare texts and they provided the seed money tosponsor this undertaking. Thus, as a result of sixteen years of painstakinglabor, the original texts have been found, collected, and minutely collated andproofread. Thus, in the year 2000, we were able to publish and distributethrough the Sichuan People’s Press a modern edition of this treatise. That said,an original copy of the latter volume of the illustrated version, itselfentitled A Garland of Suns, still eludes our search.The sublime being, a supreme adept of secret mantra, Tsédrup Tharchin,considered Repkong as his homeland but lived in the United States. For him, TheComplete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra was a jewel of sovereign power,sufficient in itself in collecting and illuminating all Buddhist discourses,tantras, and treatises. He saw it as the beautifying adornment of the Repkongtantric community and he single-mindedly applied himself to finding andrestoring the continuity of its textual, teaching, and meditative transmissions.He kept two projects in mind: the translation of the entire Complete NyingmaTradition from Sutra to Tantra into English so it could spread throughout theworld, and the founding of a college based on The Complete Nyingma Traditionfrom Sutra to Tantra at the Repkong tantric community. He felt that this wouldensure that the resplendent wealth of his ancestors’ heritage would be passeddown to future generations. With this pure, insightful intention firmly in mind,his enlightened activity has been significant.Now, the first of Lama Tharchin Rinpoche’s aspirations has come true: TheComplete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra in translation into English hasbeen published. Its distribution will spread the precious teachings of theBuddha throughout this wide world. I consider this to be a wholly positive,meaningful event that will prove to be healing and beneficial in every way. Toall those gathered under the guidance of Lama Tharchin Rinpoche in thisproject—translators, editors, benefactors, and others—I offer my humble esteemagain and again in great measure, and I send my aspirations for the auspicioussuccess of all your projects.Offered respectfully by HungchenMarch 2014Hungchen Chenagtsang is a yogi with a long family connection to the RepkongNgak-mang community, where he has been actively engaged in publishing theirtexts and preserving their traditions."},{"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM [05_toc-title.html#head_4]image [images/chapline.jpg]THE SUBLIME MASTER Lama Tharchin Rinpoche has departed for the realm of perfectpeace.Previously, he was responsible for a thorough proofreading of the edition of TheComplete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra published by the SichuanPeople’s Press and he provided a detailed list of corrections of itstypographical errors. Further, he intended to establish both a college and aretreat center based on The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra inthe homeland of its author, Choying Tobden Dorje. To facilitate studies andexperiential cultivation in meditation at those institutions, he oversaw themaking of a new electronic version of this text from which a new edition was tobe printed. Likewise, in order that The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra toTantra spread throughout the world, he planned for this work to be translatedinto both English and Chinese. For example, in the latter case, many years ago,he sponsored the great translator Lodrö Gyatso, a lord among scholars, totranslate the outline and other sections of this work into Chinese. The impactof Lama Tharchin Rinpoche’s acts such as these, both completed and ongoing,concerning The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, is of thehighest order.In the midst of his activity in 2013, our merit was insufficient to restrain himand we suffered the loss of his departure to other realms. Nevertheless, hiswife Péma Déchen, and Eric Colombel and his other disciples, are now fulfillinghis inspired vision by having the entirety of The Complete Nyingma Traditionfrom Sutra to Tantra printed and distributed. I rejoice in this and offer myheartfelt thanks.The humble Tübten Nyima[Zenkar Rinpoche]July 8, 2014Zenkar Rinpoche Tübten Nyima is a lineage holder of the Nyingma and Sakyatraditions.

Andyet, and yet . . . The high points of our spiritual lives can be exhilarating,but they can also prove risky and disorienting. Even as the end of our pathapproaches, we will still need this book. It reminds us, soothes us, comfortsand feeds us. Every time I’ve come back to this text over the last twenty yearsof my familiarity with it, I’ve thanked myself for having done so. There issomething deeply good, helpful, and useful here. You may find some newinformation in these pages, but by and large, even something novel here comes tous with a sense of “Oh, I knew that,” without that being an empty boast. This ishome ground, this is where we all started. If we haven’t previously taken thetime to explore every nook and cranny of these foundations of our path, thediscoveries we make will still feel as familiar as a cherished childhoodhideout.I make no claim for this book’s uniqueness. In fact, the greatest compliment youcould pay this volume is to place it next to your copies of The Words of MyPerfect Teacher by Patrul Rinpoche and A Torch Lighting the Way to Freedom byDudjom Rinpoche, Jigdrel Yeshe Dorje—both translated by the PadmakaraTranslation Group—and the crown jewel of such books, A Cascading Waterfall ofNectar by Thinley Norbu. Each of those books is complete in itself and lacksnothing, and despite the fact that they cover much the same territory, each isunique. In the case of Foundations of the Buddhist Path, this book contains nodirections for the uncommon preliminary practices of the tantras, yet it doesdescribe in detail all the reader needs to know and retain concerning theunderpinnings of tantric practice. This book describes the firm, necessaryfoundation upon which our spiritual lives as Buddhists can be built. I aspire tohave produced a translation worthy of the company of those other three works(themselves translations) because this book in its original Tibetan belongs withthem. These are books to live and die by.That’s a tall claim. How can I make it?It was Guru Rinpoche, Padmasambhava—who is both our earliest ancestor and ourpresent-day and future living source of inspiration—who remarked,My view is higher than the heavens,Yet my careful attention to karmaIs finer than flour.This sums up the challenge facing us all: how to keep our balance at all times,even at the heights of realization. As we approach our path’s destination, thehorizon that opens before us has been reported time and again, by male andfemale adepts of different eras and backgrounds, in the same trio of enigmaticwords: “indescribable, inconceivable, inexpressible.” Nevertheless, eachindividual who reached the peak has also echoed a gentle warning: one false stepat that altitude and the drop can be long and painful.The Foundations of the Buddhist Path is the first in a series of books—TheComplete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra—which will lead you along theentire range of theory and practice of Buddhism to its highest point, greatperfection. This first book, modest in its scope, offers lessons that accompanyus from now on until the end of our path. No matter how high we soar, this isour grounding, our refuge, our sanctuary, our comfort food.There is some information readers should be equipped with before reading thisbook, a translation of an early nineteenth-century treatise written infar-eastern Tibet, drawing mainly from fourteenth-century Central Tibetansources. You would be correct in suspecting that the author’s style does notconform to modern literary models: this introduction will first provide someorientation in the content of this book and in its classic Tibetan Buddhiststyle. Second, I will pass on what information I have concerning the identity ofthe author, Choying Tobden Dorje. Lastly, to return to the present day, I willrecount how it is that this translation project began and how it has managed tocontinue.THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE BUDDHIST PATH WITHINTHE COMPLETE NYINGMA TRADITIONThe Complete Nyingma Tradition contains a series of books on twenty-fivesubjects that lead the reader through some of the most important features of thefounding tantric Buddhist tradition in the Tibetan-speaking Himalayas, theNyingma, the “ancients.”The books that comprise this collection are of varying lengths: some are quiteshort and to the point; others sprawl. Yet despite their disparate sizes, eachof the subjects is accorded equal status. The author’s lengthy introductionlavishes us with details of the entire work—book names, chapters, number ofheadings in each, and even the number of punctuation marks in the condensedversion.That last word—version—is important in this work, for we find here fivedifferent parallel versions of The Complete Nyingma Tradition. Five texts walkus through the same twenty-five topics from beginning to end. Portions of theseappear here in translation: in order of their appearance within these covers,they are the following:(1) The extensive commentary, the longest version, entitled The Elegant Ornamentof the Age of Great Brahma (“Great Brahma” is the name of our cosmic era) andwritten in prose, serves for us as the basic treatise; the remaining fourversions, its supportive texts. (Traditional Tibetan order would have us movefrom the shortest, most abbreviated version through to the most complete.)(2) The root verses, The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses andTantras—a concise version of the text entirely in verse. In this case, each lineholds nine syllables. This condensed version serves two purposes: it functionswithin the text as an executive summary: a few of its lines appear under eachheading to announce the coming subject in brief. The second purpose is formemorization. As unlikely as it might seem, these nine-syllable lines in Tibetanare ideal to be put to tune, and persons educated in the Tibetan system oftenhave a prodigious capacity for memorizing just this kind of material.(3) The outline, entitled The Wish-Fulfilling Vine, presents the subjectheadings for all twenty-five books. That is to say, it lists the two thousand,one hundred and seventy-nine headings (yes, 2,179) contained in the books’ totalof one hundred and one chapters.(4) In the concise commentary, or word-by-word commentary, each syllable of theroot text appears in the order it was first written, interspersed with words toexpand on its significance. This text is entitled The Exquisite Treasure Vase.(5) Thus, four texts take us through the material found in these twenty-fivebooks, their one hundred and one chapters, and 2,179 subject headings. We mightnot have thought to ask for anything more. Yet there is a fifth version: anillustrated version! A Garland of the Sun, Moon, and Gems features drawings thatrecap each major subject. The author claims to have drawn 2,179 illustrations inall; I believe that number corresponds to the panels of his drawings. He countswithin the panels that recapitulate the material found in The Foundations of theBuddhist Path a total of 4,973 designs. (The author seems to count as a “design”any separate figure that appears within a panel.)An illustrated version: what a splendid idea! It was, but close to two hundredyears before its time. At the time of this book’s writing (it was completed inlate 1838), and in fact until fairly recently, the only method used for printingindigenous Tibetan books was to have them written out on long, thin planks ofwood, with each character or image written in reverse. The wood surrounding thewords or images was then carved away, ink was applied to the plank, and a sheetof paper placed on the inked plank. The paper was pressed down to transfer theink, then gingerly lifted and hung out to dry. This process is still used forprinting old texts that have not been digitally inputted; that is to say, verymany Tibetan written works.In the case of illustrations, the process of carving them backward on woodblocks tends to erase evidence of the original artist’s craftsmanship. Thefigures are recognizable but are rendered naïve; as charming as the designs canbe, modern Tibetan masters concerned with the preservation of Choying TobdenDorje’s work concur that the drawings must be redone using the tools nowavailable to us.In the absence of an illustrated version in this volume, the reader will find asimilar artifact of old Tibet: the literary apparatus that frames the main text.The author did not only write a condensed version and an outline, heincorporated them in his main work. Thus, much like a newspaper, we find eachsubject introduced with a headline in large type (the heading), followed by asynopsis in bold (lines from the root text), completed by the actual content ofthe section. This format inevitably leads to repetition, and a somewhat choppyreading experience: we are deprived of the sweet pleasure of losing ourselvesfor long in the landscape—yet another “helpful” traffic sign pops up. We willnot wander aimlessly.The positive effect of reading this material with so many signposts is that weend up retaining a sense of the map—if there is any truth to the assertion thatour brains have (just) two sides, both are well exercised by our reading. Thisis all to the good. The Buddha’s doctrine has two main facets, which we mustbalance within our spiritual lives: our ingestion of information and ourdigestion of it in meditation practice. Traditionally these are referred to asthe doctrine of scriptural transmission and the doctrine of realization. Ourauthor announces at the outset that he intends his mammoth work to serve bothfacets of the Buddhist doctrine. He writes not just for information’s sake: hehopes his words are worthy to be first read and understood, then made thesubject of reflection, and finally integrated in meditation. As thrilling as anynew understanding of Buddhism can be, we are meant to cultivate spiritualexperience based on our understanding, then realization based on thatexperience. Our author presents the complete path of the Nyingma tradition withthe express wish that his readership not be armchair travelers: we are meant totread the path he describes. At this point, we set out on our journey with justthe first ten steps entirely clear before us: The Foundations of the BuddhistPath contains the first ten of the twenty-five books he promises. Later volumesare in preparation.Our author begins, pointedly, with the subject of discipleship: we need to findnot just a good teacher but a qualified spiritual master. We need to graduatefrom our habit of studenthood to thinking of ourselves as disciples. This is asignificant step on the path—significantly Book 1 of this volume and series.Book 2 describes Buddhism and its transmission, both that of the discourses(sutras) that comprise the Buddha’s teaching of the lesser and great ways, andthe tantras of secret mantra, esoteric Buddhism. Our author again returns toBuddhism as a lived experience by devoting the final chapter of this book to thesubject of faith—the foundation of Buddhism, so he says.Books 3 to 6 cover familiar territory: our precious human life, reflection ondeath and impermanence, the workings of karma, and the flaws of the round ofrebirth. These subjects, ever so slight in the numbers of pages they occupy,have been accorded the label “books,” the better to underline their importance.Book 7, taking refuge and the lesser way, walks us through the ground rules ofBuddhist practice. This is how we enter the path, this is the original Buddhistlegal system and code of conduct. The author never encourages us to take monk ornun vows—something he did not do—but the spirit and the integrity of thisfounding stage of Buddhist practice accompany us all throughout our life asBuddhists.Books 8, 9, and 10 describe the foundation, the path, and the result of themiddle way. All Buddhists of northern Asian countries, including China, Japan,Mongolia, Korea, north India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet, bow at the feet andworship the ideal of male and female spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas. Everyperson who claims loyalty to the Nyingma tradition embraces unconditionally thematerial in these three books; there is no such thing as a Nyingma traditionwithout it. Every book in this volume contains some, even many, importantmoments for alert readers. Among them all, Books 8 and 9 are both the longestand the richest.As mentioned above, Foundations of the Buddhist Path begins with the longversion of the text, and is followed by three other versions: the root text, theoutline, and the word-by-word commentary to the root text. I have added anappendix to these, an afterword by both the author and translator. ChoyingTobden Dorje’s contribution to this appendix consists of his final words on thesubject of each book, summations found at the end of his illustrations. I foundhis short closing statements revealing of his primary concerns for each book,the things he wanted to reiterate when he looked back, thousands of pages later.I would recommend readers to consult these essays before or after you read eachmain subject. To his words I have added some of my own observations.To answer questions concerning the scope of the rest of The Complete NyingmaTradition, the lengthy introduction that precedes Book 1 in this volume presentsin full detail the map of the whole.In brief, Book 11 presents Buddhist cosmology; Book 12, a massive work initself, the major and minor subjects of Buddhist culture; Book 13, philosophy.With Book 14, we return to Buddhist practice with the three levels of outer, orexoteric, tantras and an overview of inner, or highest esoteric, tantras. Books15 to 18 cover the first two levels of inner, or esoteric, tantra, stillreferred to in the Tibetan Nyingma tradition by their Sanskrit names, mahayogaand anuyoga. With the last books, from 19 to 25, we reach the summit—atiyoga, oras it is often called, great perfection.Many, if not most, of these subjects used to be veiled in mystery, or so some ofthe first brave explorers into Tibetan territory believed. Tibetan Buddhistwisdom was surely unknown, but it was also rumored to be unknowable, and notjust in the sense that the depth experience at the end of the path of allreligions eludes the grasp of human concepts and language. Claims of tantra’smonopoly on mystery (not made by the Tibetans themselves) have looked flimsy formany years and are no longer a symptom of lack of available authoritativeinformation but of wishful thinking that such a nebulous zone can exist, acharged chalice into which current fantasies of mysticism, and more, can stillsometimes be poured.The Complete Nyingma Tradition lays out before us the full path of Tibet’sfounding tantric tradition, the “ancient” one. This much—and it is so, somuch—can be understood. Our thirsty intellects can drink their fill and feeldeeply satisfied. Then we can take our next guided steps, into spiritualexperience and realization. And, however inspiring the view from the summit canbe, we inevitably return to this book, the foundations of the Buddhist path. Therepeated injunction of lamas over the centuries has become a common saying inTibetan: “The main part of your spiritual practice will only be as good as itsfoundations.” A past leader of the Nyingma tradition, Dudjom Rinpoche(1904–1987) was more specific: “The birth of the experience of great perfectionin your stream of being depends on the foundational practices.” Foundations ofthe Buddhist Path is just the start, but what starts here ends in enlightenment.THE AUTHOR, CHOYING TOBDEN DORJE (1785–1848)The best information currently available on the subject of Choying TobdenDorje’s life has already been translated and printed, in Nyoshul Khenpo’s AMarvelous Garland of Rare Gems, translated by Richard Barron. There, we read infull,Chöying Tobden Dorjé received permission to promulgate the vast ocean ofwrathful Vajrayana practices, which employ powerful mantras like daggers ofmeteoric iron. He taught these in the northern reaches. He was born in Repkongin the northeastern region of Amdo. He began his studies by learning to read andwrite with some of the gurus, tulkus, and mentors of his home area; as histraining progressed, he became quite learned. Entering the doorway of thedharma, he took the vows of individual liberation, the bodhisattva vow, and thetantric commitments and put these into practice.He subsequently felt an intense desire to request the spiritual instructionsthat could bring freedom in a single lifetime. Setting forth to find aparticularly exalted mentor, he arrived at the encampment of Dodrupchen RinpochéJigmé Trinlé Özer and stayed for a long time with that guru. From him hereceived and practiced an enormous range of general teachings on the developmentand completion stages of the secret mantra approach, as well as the tantra TheHeart Essence of Secrets, The Three Cycles of Being at Ease, Timeless Awarenessas the Guiding Principle, and other pith instructions of the Dzogchen approach.The enlightened intent of the true nature of phenomena thus arose in his heart.As a result of this, the precious guru saw that Chöying Tobden Dorjé wouldbecome a glorious master of students in the future and that he had a karmicconnection with certain deities. He conferred on him the profound key points ofthe “four penetrations” of the great and glorious Vajrakila, the cycles ofYamantaka (such as The Four Wheels of Manjushri), The Wrathful Imprecations ofthe Mamo Goddesses to overturn negative omens, and so forth—that is, theprofound wrathful mantra practices of the Early Translation school. DodrupchenRinpoché also bestowed on Chöying Tobden Dorjé much profound advice on firerituals involving the three activities of suppression, incineration, andprojection, which enable a tantric practitioner to awaken to buddhahood. ChöyingTobden Dorjé practiced these, freeing himself through the realization that alldualistic thought patterns are the cosmic array of the mandalas of deity,mantra, and timeless awareness.Then his guru said to him, “The time has come for you to free others throughcompassion, so return to your home region and care for groups of students. Thiswill help the teachings and beings, bringing about ever-growing benefit.”Accordingly, Chöying Tobden Dorjé returned to Repkong and cared for his studentsin that region, particularly with a vast array of activities involving wrathfulmantras, and founded a settlement of lay tantric practitioners. The lineages ofstudents of Chöying Tobden Dorjé and Palchen Namkha Jigmé founded RepkongNgak-nakpa, a major center for the practice of the mantra path, renowned inevery corner of Tibet as a site of unparalleled force and might in annihilatingnegative forces and hindrances. The residents of this practice center wererenowned in oral accounts as the “1,900 bearers of ritual daggers in Repkong,”and their lineage has continued to the present day. They had enormous power, theforce to overthrow negative and demonic forces. There were many of them, andtheir amazing life stories illustrate their mastery of the activities ofwrathful force—the ability to free others through compassion—and resemble thebiographies of mahasiddhas of the past, such as Tumbu Gyazhangtrom and NupYönten Gyatso. The expressions of power of wrathful mantras created a great wallshielding the teachings.Among the many treatises the lord Chöying Tobden Dorjé is said to have writtenbased on his oral teachings were treatments of the cycles for the practicalapplication of wrathful mantras such as Black Mount Meru: The Final Activity ofSuppression. His principal work was the major treatise The Treasury of the Oceanof Sutras and Tantras, which has survived to the present day. His collectedworks were disseminated widely, and the lineage of his students spreadthroughout Repkong, Rongpo, and other northern regions for the sake of beings tobe guided, so that he came to have students beyond number. Today, there arestill many students of his lineage in those regions.1[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st1]To begin, let us first locate Choying Tobden Dorje in a modern sense of spaceand time. Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche refers to Repkong as “the northern reaches,” adesignation that fits with a Buddhist and a Tibetan geographical orientation. Onreading “northern reach” written by a Tibetan, we might imagine that if Repkongwere located in Europe, it must lie well to the north of Stockholm, whereas infact its latitude places it slightly south of Algiers. In North American terms,Repkong would not be close to Alaska or in Alberta: it would be situated southof Las Vegas.We think of Tibet as high, dry, cold, and remote. The altitude in Repkong is2,500 meters (8,202 feet), slightly higher than Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (a city ofover three million), but lower than Bogotá, Colombia (a city of over sevenmillion). Repkong is dry: it gets the same amount of rainfall yearly as Madrid(roughly 42 centimeters; 17 inches), which is more than, for example, LosAngeles. As to temperature, the average low of the coldest month (January) in acity 125 miles away, and less than 800 feet lower than Repkong, is −14°C (6°F),standard fare for parts of Scandinavia or the Canadian city where I live.Finally, Repkong might be located at the “reaches” of the Tibetan world: seenfrom Lhasa, it is indeed remote: 2,087 kilometers (close to 1,300 miles) away bythe shortest route. But Repkong lies just 167 kilometers (104 miles) fromXining, a city that holds an urban population roughly equivalent to that ofDallas, Texas (1,198,304 for Xining; 1,197,816 for Dallas). In modern times (andperhaps in days of yore), Tibetans from Repkong visiting the big city find moreof their fellow Tibetans resident in Xining (over 65,000) than they left at home(60,000 in the whole county—Tongren—that contains Repkong). Further, if pilgrimsfrom Repkong want to visit Kumbum Monastery, birthplace of the great Tsongkapa,their route will take them 120 kilometers (74 miles) further eastward, towardChina. If they then continue another 240 kilometers (149 miles), they arrive inLanzhou, a city with an urban population of 2,177,130 (comparable to Houston,2,100,263, the fourth largest city in the United States). If they wish to visitTaktser, birthplace of the present Dalai Lama, their route takes them evencloser to Lanzhou.I have digressed here to make two points. First, concerning the place whereChoying Tobden Dorje lived much of his life and wrote this masterwork, it isworth locating it on the globe to make it become a place we can realisticallyimagine. Many human beings throughout the world live in similar climacticconditions and at comparable altitudes. As human beings, they’re one of us,we’re one of them.Second, more than many Tibetans, the Nyingma residents of Repkong have alwaysbeen conscious of belonging to a minority. The numbers may have changed over thecenturies, but the proportions likely have not: Tibetans in Repkong lived in theclose orbit of two enormous Han Chinese cities with no natural boundaries (highmountain passes, for example) between them. Further, the Repkong area was and ispredominantly loyal to the Gélugpa order, not the Nyingma. It is my impressionthat the Nyingma community to which Choying Tobden Dorje belonged, and which helater served as leader, developed its own ecumenical blend and this flavors hiswriting.To begin, the Repkong community of Nyingma tantric yogis was founded by RigdzinPalden Tashi (1688–1743), who traveled from Repkong to enroll in Lhasa’s DrépungMonastery, where he completed his géshé (doctorate in religious philosophy)training.2 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st2] This thorough Gélugpa education didnot prevent him from embracing the Nyingma tradition as well, and he returned toRepkong to found a lay community of tantric practitioners. Its members stoodout: they wore (and still wear) their hair in long tresses, often dreadlockswrapped on their heads. They did not organize their community lives aroundfamiliar patterns of the monastic code. Rigdzin Palden Tashi’s mission was togather around himself those committed to embracing the ideals of tantricpractice. One of his benefactors wondered aloud if he had set too high astandard for acceptance into his community: Rigdzin Palden Tashi answered thathe preferred to have a few good members than hundreds of poor ones. On anotheroccasion, he made this remark, which remains a saying repeated among thosetrained in Repkong:You don’t need to practice the wisdom deities;You need to keep your tantric bonds.All wisdom deities accompany those who keep their tantric bonds;They don’t accept offerings from those who violate them.Therefore, always keep your tantric bonds.It stands to reason: if monks or nuns do not keep their main vows, they canhardly expect to reap the spiritual benefits of their chosen path. Likewise, thebodhisattva path only works for those who consciously and conscientiouslysustain the training of a bodhisattva. Rigdzin Palden Tashi simply makes thesame observation here in the context of the tantric path—the vows (or “bonds,”in tantric language) outweigh any other consideration, including offerings towisdom deities, or practice of mantras and meditation upon them.Tantric discipline is the most rigorous of Buddhist paths. Everyone can imaginethe sacrifice of monastic life, the noble and demanding path of simplicity,nonviolence, honesty, celibacy, and community harmony. Yet monastic vows onlyinvolve physical and verbal behavior; what goes on in one’s mind is one’s ownbusiness. Indulgence in mental afflictions, while pointless and against thespirit of the Buddhist path, do not by themselves break any monastic vows aslong as they are not expressed physically or verbally. The bodhisattva vows aremany times more difficult in that they mainly require training of the mind andthe heart. Tantric vows are said to number in the hundreds of thousands, anexaggeration to underline that they are substantially more stringent andinvasive than monastic or bodhisattva vows: we are asked to embrace and sustainat every moment until enlightenment a radical, awakened sense of embodiment andenworldment in which our once-dominant rational dualistic mind plays only asupporting role, at best. As compared, monastic vows and bodhisattva trainingseem like child’s play since they are situated in our conventional sense ofourselves, others, and the world.Rigdzin Palden Tashi first trained in a Gélugpa monastic center. The strength ofthe Gélugpa order at its best is scrupulous mind training and impeccablehonoring of vows. My impression is that Rigdzin Palden Tashi’s genius was toapply the spirit of his Gélugpa training to creating a community as devoted toand as irreproachable in tantric discipline as the mainstream Gélugpainstitutions were in pre-tantric vows and training.When Choying Tobden Dorje and Palchen Namkha Jigmé (1757–1821, mentioned aboveas a fellow disciple of the first Dodrupchen) returned to Repkong, each foundedhis own community of tantric yogis with much the same mission as that of RigdzinPalden Tashi. Palchen Namkha Jigmé had trained with some Gélugpa masters, and heset the tone for his followers by forbidding the consumption of meat or alcoholin the course of any religious ceremony. Choying Tobden Dorje was a vegetarianwho encouraged his readers to eat as he did and to not wear leather clothing;the great Shabkar (1781–1851), another Repkong yogi, followed the same pattern:early Gélugpa training, vegetarianism, and full monastic ordination, but hechose for his appearance that of a tantric practitioner—long hair andnonmonastic robes. The outer “look” is wild but the inner vows to remainimmersed in tantric pure perception are unimaginably strict, deep, anddemanding.Choying Tobden Dorje was one of the “four great roof beams”—close disciples ofthe first Dodrupchen, Jigmé Trinlé Özer, who was in turn the main disciple ofJigmé Lingpa (1730–1798), revered by all Nyingma practitioners. One of hisdisciples was Shabkar, in whose life story we read,[Choying Tobden Dorje] was a Nyingmapa master renowned for his tantric powersand realization of the Great Perfection. He was a disciple of the first DoDrupchen, Jigme Trinley Öser, Kunzang Shenpen, and founded the monastery ofKohudeh Dzogchen Namgyal Ling, where he taught Jigme Lingpa’s Longchen Nyingthigcycle.Around 1833, Shabkar read some of Tobden Dorje’s writings, including theTreasury of Sutra and Tantra, and was moved to faith. He sent a song of praiseto the master, whom he calls Kushog Dzogchen Rinpoche, the Precious Master ofthe Great Perfection. Shabkar went to meet Tobden Dorje at Gartse. He wasreceived with great pomp and ceremony, and Tobden Dorje compelled him to takehis own seat. Shabkar then requested from Tobden Dorje a longevity blessing andthe transmission of the Treasury of Sutra and Tantra.When Tobden Dorje died in 1848, Shabkar performed all the funeral rituals andcomforted the master’s consort and two sons.3 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st3]What is referred to here as “Kohudeh Dzogchen Namgyal Ling” is now called“Dzokchen Namgyal Ling Ngakpa House,” probably a more accurate name than“monastery.” The book that so inspired Shabkar, Treasury of Sutra and Tantra, isthis one, The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra. Nyoshul Khenpo’sbook includes a note on the subject of the same book, there referred to as TheTreasury of the Ocean of Sutras and Tantras. The note reads, “An Englishtranslation of this monumental collection is in preparation; the project isoverseen by Tarchin Rinpoche of the Repkong lineage, who resides in Californiaat the center Pema Ösel Ling.”ACKNOWLEDGMENTSTo understand how this translation project came to be, we must delve into themeaning of a Tibetan term, gong dzok (dgongs rdzogs). Gong is the honorific termfor whatever moves in the mind of enlightened beings; when it is used as a noun,as in this case, it is often translated as “intention.” Dzok means to completeor to finish. In Tibetan dictionaries, this term’s definitions include “to die,honorific”; that is to say, the individual has signaled by death the completionof the projects, the intention, that motivated the rebirth now ended. When theword drup (sgrub) is added to gong dzok, the dictionary informs us that thismeans to perform a funeral ceremony, literally, to signal the completion of theenlightened individual’s intentions for that life.So dictionaries say. What disciples of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual masters meanby these terms goes well beyond death and funerals, or even memorial orcommemorative ceremonies.image [images/image46-00.jpg]LAMA SHERAB DORJE RINPOCHE.PHOTOGRAPHER UNKNOWN.COURTESY OF THE LAMA THARCHIN RINPOCHE HERITAGE FOUNDATION.The original impetus behind the translation of The Complete Nyingma Traditionfrom Sutra to Tantra was first articulated to me using just those two words—gongdzok. Here is what was meant in this context: In the course of a life, thebuddhas and bodhisattvas who take intentional rebirth among us communicate bywords or gestures what they find meaningful in this world. To their disciples,the things they love become imbued with significance. This flower, this garden,this area, this region touched the living buddha more than another: they becomehis or her emblem, they carry special import, they are worthy to be preserved.The activity of keeping such aspects of an enlightened individual’s presencealive on the earth can be referred to as gong dzok. Although the word itself isrooted in an individual’s death, the accent here is on keeping the individual’sintention alive and present.If this seems foreign, we only have to consider how nations view the lives andwritings of their founders, or for whom statues are built, or for whom roads,bridges, parks, schools, airports, cities, and whole regions are named. Thiscould be considered some form of secular gong dzok. In the Tibetan Buddhistcommunity, the continuation of spiritual masters’ projects after their demise isoften managed within ongoing institutional structures.For individual Buddhists, the place of gong dzok in our lives is morecomplicated. Let us take the case in point: during his lifetime, a Tibetanmaster often mentioned in his disciple’s hearing The Complete Nyingma Traditionfrom Sutra to Tantra as an excellent text that had greatly influenced him. Thedisciple had never seen the text and tried to procure a copy over many years,asking many high lamas and scholars where he could find it. Eventually, manydecades after his master had passed away, he was given the condensed version ofthe work, and set out to have it translated. All this in the name of gongdzok—keeping alive the blessed sight and wisdom mind of a living buddha. Thedeceased master in question had never asked for this book to be translated; hemerely praised the book on occasion. Those few words, perhaps deliveredcasually, remained: this book was something that gave pleasure to this masterduring his lifetime; that recollection on the part of his attentive disciple wasenough to launch this project.The master was Lama Sherab Dorjé Rinpoche, a native of Repkong and the sameNyingma communities of lay tantric practitioners that produced Choying TobdenDorje. He was an authentic master who took a young relative under his wing ashis disciple or apprentice—the master we now know as Lama Tharchin Rinpoche.Lama Tharchin began his spiritual journey as a perfect disciple of two mastershe held in the utmost regard: His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche and Lama Sherab. Itis possible to object, “Well, he had two excellent masters to follow. It wouldhave been difficult for him to become something other than a good disciple!” Butdiscipleship is no easy matter. As rare as it is for us to find and to meet aperfect spiritual master, those incredible masters have just as challenging atask before them: finding persons who are worthy disciples at every level. Someexcellent masters live and die never having met the right vessels for theirinstruction. This is a recurring tragedy: strong lineages do not depend simplyon the appearance of a single living buddha but on a series of such buddhas,male or female, each of whom while alive pours the essence of timelessrealization into a living golden vessel, who must then live long enough to findanother.Lama Tharchin was just such a golden vessel.He was also the guiding light behind this project. I wish I could end thatsentence with “from start to finish,” but he passed away too soon to see histireless work come to fruition in this and the other books of this series. Thiswould be the right place to write of him, but it is not the right time. It hasbeen just a matter of months since he left. I am not yet sufficiently sober,emotionally, to reflect upon all he has given me and this project, and to putthose thoughts into words. Another time, I hope.What is possible to express now under the heading of acknowledgments is my deepgratitude to the members of the spiritual community that gathered around him. Itraveled and translated for Rinpoche in North America, Hawaii, Asia, and Europefor twenty years, and I lived at his home center in California’s Santa CruzMountains for fifteen of them. From the start, what impressed me about hisdisciples, my new spiritual companions, was that their teacher had introducedeach of them to buddha nature, and each was trying to accommodate that freshsight into Buddhist practice and daily life.I can vividly recall my first experience of meditating with them. Yes, I wasrich in years of retreat experience and in language skills, and I was alone inthat group in understanding what Tibetan lamas said in their own language and inhaving some familiarity with the Buddhist systems of thought from which theydrew. Nevertheless, from that first occasion, my pride was shattered. I recallbeing aghast at myself, at my small-minded assumptions concerning the relationbetween meditation practice and realization, or between mastery of Buddhistknowledge and realization. These new companions of mine had little or no retreatexperience and little or no familiarity with Buddhist scholarship. And yet eachhad a palpable depth of being that I found undeniable, and challenging to myhard-won preconceptions. I felt ashamed of myself. How had I become so stuck, sojudgmental, so pettily . . . Buddhist?The key of course was Lama Tharchin himself. As a teacher, his strategy wasexplicitly modeled on advice he received from Thinley Norbu Rinpoche: start atthe summit of Buddhist instruction, with an introduction to nondual awareness;whatever Buddhist practice an individual does subsequently will further theirexperience. So I found myself faced with what were in fact highly developed andadvanced practitioners whom I was to serve as translator although they hadalready received and integrated the highest teaching possible. Basically, my jobwas to not make a mess of what was already as close to ideal as one gets in thisworld. They knew directly the deepest truth of their own being: why shouldlesser truths, the rest of Buddhist teaching, be rendered foreign orinaccessible by clumsy translation?During the next years, before I moved to California, I had the opportunity totranslate for Lama Tharchin Rinpoche in France, where he spoke not a word of thelanguage. Time and again, he was able to put his finger on each person’s basicmakeup and to guide him or her to a recognition of their buddha nature, and tomake it seem as if it were the most natural and reasonable thing in the world tocontinue nurturing that recognition. Therefore, his success in producing a wholecommunity of such individuals in California was not due to his ability to speakEnglish; it wasn’t linguistic or cultural magic. Lama Tharchin’s realization ofhis own enlightened nature was highly contagious and I watched as he infectedpractically everyone who crossed his path.Meeting Rinpoche’s California community changed my life as a translator. Myfirst teacher Kalu Rinpoche advised us, his translators, to write with aspecific audience in mind: persons with at least a college degree who weren’tever going to become Buddhist scholars. Write so they can understand, he’d tellus, even when we were translating books written for professional Buddhists intechnical language. He wanted us to decode a text into what could be appreciatedby readers who had a decent education outside the rarified realm of Buddhiststudies. In short, he knew we knew Tibetan; he wanted to know if we knewEnglish, that is, if we were willing and able to translate Tibetan intostandard, non-Buddhist English.I tried to keep Kalu Rinpoche’s directives in mind, but my work for him tookplace in France and in Asia. The audience he’d had me imagine as I wrote wasentirely virtual: I hadn’t lived in an English-speaking country since 1976. Thisis where Lama Tharchin’s community comes in—it turned out to be theflesh-and-blood audience Kalu Rinpoche had always asked us to imagine. Men andwomen of all walks of life, most of whom had college degrees; masters ordoctorate degrees plentiful among them. They listened to Lama Tharchin’sinstruction not to merely study Buddhism—opportunities to do just that areplentiful in the San Francisco Bay area—but to understand, experience, andrealize it. My job was to render Lama Tharchin’s Tibetan speech into accessibleEnglish. He often repeated the advice he’d given another translator: “Imagineyou’re writing a letter to your father and he has to understand without youstanding beside him, explaining each word.” This is what he expected of me inpublic, oral translation, and what he hoped for such texts as this.I eventually moved from France to California and lived at Lama Tharchin’s centerfor fifteen years during which time I sat next to him, facing his wonderfuldisciples, hundreds, likely many thousands of them. The surfaces of their livesresemble those of any other human beings: modern life is terribly busy andunreasonably complicated, and in the midst of it all, sickness, aging, and deathmake unwelcome, inconvenient visits and decide to stay. So yes, these people Igrew to know so well are regular male and female “dudes”—good-naturedCalifornians of all ages and races. But not far below the surface, they arepersons as rare as stars in the daytime, the most incredibly fortunate personswho were wise enough to take the opportunity to approach an enlightened teacher,gaze into the mirror of his teaching, and immerse themselves in the nondualawareness he showed them to be already present, their true nature—enlightenment.In my mind’s eye, I see their faces as they listen to Lama Tharchin’s words thatemerge from a dimension of nondual wisdom and nondual compassion outside spaceand time, words that are then somehow funneled through my voice. I have beenthoroughly humbled and inspired by the members of this community, one and all.My translation work on this series is done with them in mind, a mental slideshow of modern male and female adepts whose lives are devoted to the care andfeeding of nondual awareness. Members of Vajrayana Foundation and the Péma ÖselLing community, this book and all the next in this series are for you, withloving thanks.Acknowledgments usually name names. The first of these is Lama Yeshe Wangmo, theperson who steered me toward Lama Tharchin and this translation project. Shegrew up close to me in both Nova Scotia and Montréal, attended McGill Universityin 1970 as I did, and completed a three-year, three-month retreat under theguidance of the same teacher, Kalu Rinpoche, all without our ever having met. Wefinally met as fellow translators at Kalu Rinpoche’s feet in Bodhgaya, India,site of the Buddha’s enlightenment, and she later introduced me to Lama Tharchinin Hawaii. I speak from experience in saying that should you need any goodadvice, you would do well to approach Lama Yeshe Wangmo, then follow throughtaking to heart whatever she has told you.The incredible wisdom being known as Anam Thubten oversaw this project for manyyears and answered thousands upon thousands of my questions without complaint.His kindness is the sole reason this project ever had a hope of bearing fruit.Minling Khenpo, a hidden Tibetan yogi-scholar of the highest order who nowwanders in Californian jungles, ably answered what questions remained.One sure sign that this project has attracted the blessings of the buddhas isthat one of the foremost Western translators, Gyurme Dorje, has agreed totranslate a couple of major parts of this work. There is nothing in TibetanBuddhism that falls outside the scope of his expertise, as readers of somefuture volumes in this series will see. His translation style and my own arevery different, but Lama Tharchin Rinpoche, the project sponsors, and I will bethrilled to welcome Gyurme Dorje’s contributions: his many publishedtranslations are uniformly impeccable.Between the completion of a manuscript and its rebirth as a book, we depend on ateam of bodhisattvas who work together as Shambhala Publications. Susan Kyserand Nikko Odiseos are the two deeply trustworthy persons, editor and publisher,who have earned our esteem again and again. Among Lama Tharchin’s disciples, thestellar Gary Burstein led the community by his example in always finding thetime, energy, and patience for the needs of this translation.Two patrons supported this project. We might imagine benefactors to be wealthypersons aloof from Buddhist practice who take a little time to give to thisworthy cause. That is not the case with either of these patrons—Stephen Farrowand Eric Colombel. If either of them might sometime seem preoccupied, it is notthat he wants to slip away to further their business. Both first and foremostdevote themselves to putting the teachings they receive into practice and areexemplary models of Western Buddhists. When the history of this period ofBuddhism coming to the modern world is written, it will be clear that theirsignificant contributions to establishing Buddhism in different domains (outsideof this project) have been very wise and hugely significant. In Eric’s case, heand I have been helped by his able right hand man and woman, Lama Drubgyu Tenzin(Anthony Chapman) and Christiane Buchet of Tsadra Foundation. In my case, whenmy personal stores of humor and insight, lightness and love, dip precariouslylow, I am inevitably recharged in full by my young-minded elderly mother,Elizabeth Curry, my wise-beyond-her-years madcap young daughter, Nina Thompson,and my perfect partner, Chönyi Drolma.Lastly, while I served as Lama Tharchin’s voice for many years, he and I havealways been accompanied by the embodiment of his heart and mind—Libby Luning(also known by her Buddhist name, Péma Déchen), his mate, his match. That’ssaying something, likely more than you think and surely more than I can fathom.All of us have worked long and hard to produce this series of books to bring tocompletion the inspiration of Lama Sherab Dorjé Rinpoche’s life, never for amoment expecting that this gift that Lama Tharchin Rinpoche intended to give hiscommunity of disciples and the world would arrive too late to have come directlyfrom his hands to yours. Nevertheless, in his name we offer you this part of hislegacy. He wanted you to have it. As he said so many times to one and all:“Don’t worry!

The Resolve to Compose the Textimage [images/line.jpg]PROLOGUEEnlightenment’s glorious three bodies, three jewels, and three roots, with ahost of guardians, to you I bow!Wondrous Maheshvara, source of bliss, exalted in wondrous glory; wondrous,four-faced Brahma; victorious Indra; and other gods;Wondrous Lord of the Nagas, wealthy with wondrous riches; wondrous Fire God Bornfrom Gifts, and powerful seers—The wondrous crowns of this multitude of wondrous greats among great beings holdsupreme, wondrous jewels—Wondrous ornaments that decorate the toenails of thewondrous Victor, the Buddha: may he bestow wondrous auspicious blessings!The essence of our being, primordial purity, in which embellishments areentirely still, transcends realms of thought and expression.Our nature, radiant ever presence, holds the complete perfection of everyquality of what is noncomposite.All-encompassing nondual compassion produces an endless ocean of effortlessenlightened activity.These three are inseparable in a single sphere—awakened mind, awareness, naturalgreat perfection: to it I bow.The dawn of the enlightened heritage, beings’ innate constituent enlightenment,buddha nature, shines with a garland of rays, wisdom’s bodies and realms.Moist clouds—dualistic, deluded thoughts born from ignorance—cover it and rain aconstant deluge of karma and mental afflictions.This dark, dense suffering—transitory stains to be cleansed—can be swept away bycleansing, fragrance-bearing forceful winds,The Buddhist ways of spiritual development based on the discourses and tantras:therefore, I now set forth this extensive commentary.THE SUBJECT REFERRED TO here, the sublime ambrosia of the Buddhist sacreddoctrine, is found in this treatise entitled The Complete Nyingma Tradition fromSutra to Tantra. This excellent text contains the essence of the realization ofinfinite numbers of buddhas of all times and directions, validated in thetransmission of their canon; pith instructions validated by a sea of scholars,accomplished meditators, and awareness holders, and by my holy spiritual master;the key instructions found in every treatise on the major subjects of Buddhistculture; and information I have validated with my own reasoning, based onhearing the doctrine, reflecting, and meditating upon it.On an outer level, this text provides subjects to be attentively heard: itswords of the scripture’s teachings form towering waves on a wide ocean. On aninner level, this text provides subjects for reflection: its meanings, potentjewels of knowledge, are arrayed in superb designs. On a secret level, this textprovides subjects for meditation: this work thoroughly explains the keyinstructions for experiential cultivation according to the tantras, andilluminates them with the radiant brilliance of the sun and moon.The extensive commentary to this garland of wish-fulfilling gems, sufficient initself for all purposes, has three major parts: an introduction, the main text,and the conclusion. The inaugural engagement in the treatise, its preliminary,creates the text’s initial virtue, the introduction. The domain of thatengagement, the body of the treatise, the text’s substance, creates the work’scontinuing virtue—the main text. Completion of the treatise creates the work’sculminating virtue, the conclusion.THE MEANING OF THE TITLE OF THE ROOT TEXT [I]This section has two parts: (1) a brief presentation of the reason for titles,and (2) the extensive explanation of the meaning of the title of the root text.The Reason for Titles [A]Persons of the very highest degree of acumen understand the import of a text bymerely having heard a presentation of its title. The great master Vimalamitraaffirms this in The Clear Lamp, an Overview:Those of the highest degree of acumen comprehend by a presentation of the title;those of a medium degree of acumen, by the table of contents;And the average, by a careful elucidation of each syllable.The Short Commentary states:Since it epitomizes a preliminary,The initial expression of the title is crucial.Self-Liberated Awareness states:An explanation of the title is like this:It consists of the title, homage, and the resolve.Thus, to begin, I will explain the meaning of the title the book bears.The Meaning of the Title of the Root Text [B]This section has three parts: (1) translation of the title, (2) an explanationof the title, and (3) the text to which this title is given.Translation of the Title [1]The title of this root text in the well-constructed language of India (Sanskrit)is translated to Tibetan (and English) as follows: sutra can be rendered as mdo,discourse(s); tantra can be rendered as rgyud, tantra(s); ratna can be renderedas rin po che’i, invaluable; kosha can be rendered as mdzod, treasury; nama canbe rendered as zhes bya ba’i, known as; shastra can be rendered as bstan bcos,treatise; viharatisma can be rendered as bzhugs, is here.In Tibetan, the title of the root text is pronounced “do gyu rinpoché-i dzö” andis translated into English as The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses andTantras.Explanation of the Title [2]In the title, the word discourse is defined as follows. The Ornament of theDiscourses states:Because they describe circumstances, characteristics,Phenomena, and meaning, they are discourses.As stated here, a discourse describes the circumstances of its delivery—theplace and time of a teaching, the identity of its teacher, and for whom theteaching was spoken. It describes characteristics—the characteristics ofrelative truth and of ultimate truth. It describes phenomena, such as thepsychophysical aggregations, sense elements, sense bases, and interdependentarising. It describes meaning—the meaning of the Buddha’s intention concerningthese subjects. Because such teachings are expressed in the form of dialogues,they are called discourses. The Compendium of All Discourses states:Having seen its ten advantages, the Transcendent Buddha revealed his teachingsin the form of dialogues, which facilitates (1) an outline, (2) a presentation,and (3) retention; and induces (4) respect, through which stores of goodness andwisdom quickly become complete. The listener (5) quickly realizes the nature ofreality, (6) gains faith based on knowledge of the Buddha, and gains faith basedon knowledge of (7) the doctrine and (8) the spiritual community. It leads to(9) reaching the sublime state of abiding in happiness during this lifetime; andit (10) can be discussed informally.Thus, discourses delight the minds of the holy individuals who teach, andlisteners enter the ranks of those known as learned among the wise.What is it that is called tantra in the title? The Later Tantra states:Tantra is explained as that which is continuous—Techniques and causes produce the result.Thus, in general, the meaning of what is continuous gives us the term tantra(literally, “continuum”). If classified, tantra spans the following: what mustbe realized—the continuity of the ground of our being or cause (that is, buddhanature); what produces realization and progress on the path—the continuity oftechniques or the spiritual path; the ultimate goal—the continuity of theresult; and the volumes that contain the verbal tantras which clearly revealthese subjects. These verbal tantras consist of three categories of exoterictantras: action, conduct, and yoga; and three categories of esoteric tantras:creation, completion, and great perfection.All discourses and tantras comprise the Buddhist canon. The canon includes thespoken word, such as instruction spoken by the teachers manifest as the threewisdom bodies—the modes of teaching found in Buddhism’s nine progressivespiritual systems. These nine are based upon the following sets of texts: themonastic code, discourses, the study of observed phenomena, action tantra,conduct tantra, yoga tantra, the phase of creation, the phase of completion, andgreat perfection.The canon also includes words the Buddha inspired; that is, instruction spokenby any person in his circle of disciples or any object the Buddha blessed; aswell as words he authorized. For example, The Transcendence of Sorrow Discoursestates:Ananda, when you compile the doctrine after my complete transcendence of sorrow,introduce discourses with, “At one time, I heard these words.” Then relate thediscourse with connecting words and finish with, “The Transcendent Conqueror’sspeech was manifestly praised.” Compile the discourses in this manner.If the canon is classified according to antidotes, the twenty-one thousandinstructions in the collection on the monastic code provide antidotes totwenty-one thousand varieties of the mental affliction of desire. The twenty-onethousand instructions in the collection of discourses provide antidotes toanger. The twenty-one thousand instructions in the collection on observedphenomena provide antidotes to stupidity. The twenty-one thousand instructionsin the great collection on observed phenomena, secret mantra, provide antidotesto those three poisons in equal measure. Thus the Buddha taught a total ofeighty-four thousand instructions. Presentation of an Inexhaustible Treasurestates:The Buddha taught sets of instructionsIn numbers equal to the antidotesFor twenty-one thousand varieties of desire, anger, stupidity,And those three poisons in equal measure.Thus, the measure of a single set of instructions is its functioning as athorough antidote to its corresponding mental affliction.The collection on the monastic code, including such compilations as the fourmain texts on the transmission of the monastic code, emphasizes training inethical conduct. The collection of discourses, including such works as ThePerfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand Stanzas, emphasizestraining in mind. The collection on observed phenomena, including suchcompilations as the seven texts on observed phenomena, emphasizes training insublime insight.If the canon is classified according to modes of expression, the Buddha’sexcellent speech has twelve categories: discourses, aphorisms in prose andverse, prophetic declarations, verses, purposeful declarations, accounts toprovide frameworks, narrative stories, legends, tales of the buddha’s pastlives, extensive teachings, marvelous events, and definitions.Classified according to its content, the canon has two categories, provisionalmeaning and definitive meaning. Instruction that emphasizes relative truthexpresses provisional meaning; instruction that emphasizes ultimate truthexpresses definitive meaning. The Discourse Requested by Inexhaustible Intellectstates:Instruction that affirms relative truth expresses provisional meaning;Instruction that affirms ultimate truth expresses definitive meaning.Invaluable treasury in the title refers to a precious gem of sovereign powerthat, according to your wishes, effortlessly showers a rain of everything youneed and desire, providing perfect health, longevity, and abundant happiness. Tofind a limitless number of such gems, colorful and replete with many-facetedqualities, to fill an inexhaustible, massive treasure house spanning many miles,would prove extremely valuable. Likewise, the innermost essential vitalinstructions of the words, meanings, depth, and vastness of all the canon’sdiscourses, tantras, and pith instructions are concentrated in these volumes,which provide magnificent, inexhaustible, unsurpassable help and happiness, bothtemporary and ultimate. Whoever uses these texts for hearing the doctrine, orfor reflection or meditation on it, will surely procure such effects withouthardship. At the very least, whatever connection you make with them, by means ofsuch activity as copying, reciting them aloud, or memorizing them, will plantthe seed of liberation and definitely result in your attainment of manifest,complete enlightenment. Therefore, this work corresponds to the metaphor of aninvaluable treasury. Known as in the title refers to the name given the workwhose contents correspond to this special metaphor and meaning.Treatise in the title refers to a treatise distinct from the six flawed genresof non-Buddhist texts, and which is written in the three styles characteristicof Buddhist treatises. The Bodhisattvas’ Stages of Awakening states:We believe three kinds of valid treatises are free from these six flawed genres:Meaningless or of invalid meaning; versus meaningful;Stressing study or debate; versus emphasizing accomplishment;Misleading or cruel; versus effective in relieving suffering.The six flawed genres of treatises refer to the following: treatises that lackcorrect meaning, such as the four Vedas; invalid treatises, such as those thatassert that liberation can be attained based on such views as eternalism andnihilism; treatises that stress study, such as texts on the composition ofpoetry; treatises that stress debate, such as texts on intellectual systems;misleading treatises, such as those concerned with victory in battle; and crueltreatises, harmful to yourself and others, such as those that assert that thesacrifice of cattle or other animals constitutes valid religious practice.Distinctly separate from these six are three kinds of treatises that presentBuddhists’ inner spirituality: treatises that have as their high objective theachievement of temporal happiness and ultimate freedom, treatises that emphasizemeditation practices that lead to awakening, and treatises that explain how toentirely relinquish the round of rebirth’s suffering.Supreme treatises are those written by such masters referred to as the sixornaments and the two exemplary masters. Treatises such as Gunaprabha’s The RootDiscourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct provide a condensation of the vastcanon. Treatises such as Maitreya’s The Ornament of Manifest Realization andNagarjuna’s The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight discern the profundity ofthe canon. Treatises such as Shantideva’s Compendium of Training, Maitreya’s TheOrnament of the Discourses, or Ashvaghosha’s The Past Lives of the Buddha bringorder to unsystematic material. Worldly treatises, such as Nagarjuna’s OneHundred Prescriptions, Nagarjuna’s A Drop of Nourishment for Individuals, andSuryagupta’s A Treasury of Verse, present the nature of knowledge. Treatisessuch as the definitive truth (that is, Asanga’s Compendium of ObservedPhenomena) and Shantarakshita’s Ornament of the Middle Way present the breadthof knowledge. Treatises such as Asanga’s The Hearers’ Stages of Awakening,Asanga’s The Bodhisattvas’ Stages of Awakening, and Shantideva’s Entering theConduct of Bodhisattvas present the path to liberation and omniscience.Further, there exist infinite numbers of enumerations, such as instruction inthe form of extensive lists, presentation of difficult points, clarification ofthe order of terms, succinct presentations of terms’ meanings, and distinctionsbetween former and subsequent subjects. These enumerations have been organizedinto sections, portions, articles, and chapters; in prose, verse, or a mixtureof prose and verse. Their separate sections elucidate short, middle, multiple,or long texts and thus bring vivid clarity to the Buddha’s canon. Theyfacilitate discernment among four topics—provisional meaning, definitivemeaning, direct intention, and indirect intention. Accordingly, this treatise iswritten in a style consistent with such treatises that preserve the Buddha’sdoctrine for a long time.The Text to Which This Title Is Given [3]In the title, Buddhist Discourses and Tantras—the canonical source of thistext’s words, meaning, and philosophy—indicates the text’s import. In the title,The Invaluable Treasury, where this information is placed, is a metaphor. TheTreatise Known as refers to this profound and wide-ranging text that unites boththe subject and the metaphor.AN EXPRESSION OF HOMAGE [II]This section has two parts: (1) a brief homage and (2) the extensive homage.A Brief Homage [A]Lord Ever Excellent, to you I bow.To translate this sentence from Sanskrit, Shri means Lord; Samantabhadra-yameans to Ever Excellent; Namo means I bow.In the context of the ground of our being, Lord refers to self-arisen wisdom;Ever, to never having moved from the Excellent wisdom mind, never joined to norseparate from enlightenment’s bodies and wisdoms, unmoving and immutablethroughout past, present, and future; I bow means “May I realize that meaning.”In the context of the spiritual path, Lord refers to stable settling inawareness, the awakened mind, the body of ultimate enlightenment’s enlightenedperspective; Ever, eternal resting within that ongoing state, never leaving it;Excellent, when the body of ultimate enlightenment’s ongoing state has not beenoverstepped, all appearances and mind arise as primordially liberated, greatperfection’s display; I bow, to “May I be diligent in having my meditation reachthe expanse of the nature of reality.”In the context of the result of the Buddhist spiritual path (that is,enlightenment), Lord refers to the original lord protector, who appears as thespiritual master of both the round of rebirth and transcendent states, yetdwells in the ever-present, precious secret enclosure, never joined to norseparate from indwelling luminosity, enlightenment’s bodies and wisdoms. Everrefers to the array, within that ongoing state, of the five certain features ofthe wisdom body of rapture in the pure land of Dense Design; Excellent, withinthat ongoing state, to the supreme nondual compassion which produces the sixsages’ displays that guide the six kinds of beings within each of their realms;I bow, to the offering of respect.The Extensive Homage [B]This section has three parts: (1) homage to the teachers who epitomize the threewisdom bodies, (2) homage to the three jewels, and (3) homage to the threeroots.Homage to the Teachers Who Epitomize the Three Wisdom Bodies [1]The body of ultimate enlightenment, Ever Excellent, attained enlightenmentbefore all other victors.The wisdom bodies of perfect rapture are the victors, peaceful and wrathfuldeities—male and female chiefs of the five wisdom clans.The manifest wisdom bodies are victors who manifest in such forms as are callednatural, realm-guiding, supreme, or according to beings’ needs.These victors are inseparable within the essential wisdom body. To all whoepitomize these, I pay homage.Our teacher Ever Excellent abides as the body of perfect rapture and the body ofultimate enlightenment in the highest pure land of all buddhas’ realms, while hesends out emanations in every place to guide disciples of every kind. ACommentary to Valid Cognition states:Freed from the web of discursive thought,Master of profound and vast wisdom bodies—Ever Excellent, whose radiant lightShines everywhere, to you I bow.Ever Excellent as the ground of our being consists of all phenomena’s truenature as it is, called “Ever Excellent as our indwelling nature.” EverExcellent as adornments consists of all phenomena’s appearances, arising ofthemselves as the display of phenomenal entities; any and all are pure withinthe nature of magical illusion. Ever Excellent as a teacher consists of theoriginal lord protector, Eternal Light, chief of all wisdom clans. EverExcellent as awareness consists of self-arisen wisdom, buddha nature. EverExcellent as realization consists of the abiding nature of the basic characterof our being; to accurately realize it is to gain the eyes of freedom. TheMirror of Ever Excellent’s Wisdom Mind states:Know all phenomena as the nature of five forms of Ever Excellent. What are thesefive forms? They are Ever Excellent as the indwelling nature, Ever Excellent asadornment, Ever Excellent as teacher, Ever Excellent as awareness, and EverExcellent as realization.Further, before any victor in the three times, Ever Excellent purified everystain of dualistic ignorance, and his stores of wisdom and qualities fullyblossomed. He is ever excellent in three circumstances—the round of rebirth,transcendent states, and the spiritual path—the sublime body of ultimateenlightenment, the wisdom of purity and evenness. The Magnificent King Tantrastates:In the beginning, before all others,He reached fulfillment in the self-manifest ground of being.Purified first and blossomed first,He is the original Ever ExcellentCalled the teacher of all the round of rebirth and transcendent states.Within the ongoing body of ultimate enlightenment, wisdom bodies endowed withform appear in the ultimate, supreme Highest Pure Land. The five male and femalevictors, chiefs of the wisdom clans—the five are transcendent buddha, vajra,jewel, lotus, and action—appear as hosts of peaceful and wrathful deities, themain figures and their encircling entourage inseparable. The sacred circles ofthis, their wisdom body of perfect rapture, show many dances of colors,ornaments, attributes, and postures; and they abide continually, forever withinthe pure basic space of phenomena, adorning it without any gap. The SecretEssence Tantra states:Masterful in the basic space of suchness itself, the sacred circles of wisdom,nondual compassion’s ongoing state,Are self-manifest—magical forms of meditative states’ clear and purereflections.These are wish-fulfilling jewels—unaltered qualities of wisdom body, speech,mind, qualities, and activity.Their circle of ornaments, inexhaustible, is the sublime vajra place.Within the ongoing state of the body of perfect rapture, manifest bodies appearin various forms: For example, these semi-manifest wisdom bodies of perfectrapture, the five victors—the buddhas Immutable, Source of Jewels, InfiniteLight, Accomplisher of Goals, and Illuminator—appear in the five pure lands ofthe victors’ natural manifest body—Truly Joyful, Glorious, Blissful, Acts’Fulfillment, and Highest Pure Land of Dense Design.Realm-guiding manifest wisdom bodies include the six sages: Shakra, sage amonggods; Vimachitra, sage among demigods; Sage of the Shakyas, sage among humanity;Steadfast Lion, sage among animals; Blazing Mouth, sage among starving spirits;and King of the Teachings, sage among hell beings.Sublime manifest bodies demonstrate the twelve deeds of the Buddha. Emanationsthat appear in relation to beings’ needs take different forms—rulers, leaders,scientists, jewels, residences, roads, medicines; or as createdemanations—representations of wisdom body, speech, or mind—and in infinite othermanifestations.The inseparability of these, the victors’ three wisdom bodies in a singlesphere, is the essential wisdom body. To all those who epitomize these forms, Ibow with the deepest faith and respect. This constitutes homage. Self-ManifestAwareness Tantra states:To think that various forms appear in diversityFrom the three bodies’ single nature is a mistake.The body of ultimate enlightenment surpasses the domain of thought;The body of perfect rapture surpasses the demons of concepts;And the manifest body surpasses material phenomena.The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:The Sage’s essential bodyIs any attainment of uncontaminated phenomena,Pure in every circumstance.Those are its natural characteristics.The Tantra of the Magical Display’s Manifest Awakening states:Because they master awakening’s pure stages,The five teachers, the five highest teachings,And the five complete and perfect wisdomsGo to the heart of perfect awakening.The All-Creating Sovereign states:The manifest body guides this realm:In one hundred million or more of our worlds, called Land of Jambu,Self-arisen wisdom’s nondual compassion subdues the six streams of beings.The Flower Ornament Discourse states:O child of enlightened heritage! A transcendent buddha’s manifestations aremeasureless: they act to help in any way that their form, color, and name canguide any being.The same text further states:If beings can be guided by the form of a mendicant, a brahmin, a starvingspirit, or a hell being, the buddhas manifest that form and work for others’benefit.The Discourse of Entering Wisdom’s Domain states:If appearances as a pleasure garden, a jewel, medicine, a wisdom mantra, orvarious useful articles can guide beings, the buddhas will appear with suchforms and colors.Highest Illusion states:Myriad manifestations are ceaseless:They become such beings as hunters or prostitutesAnd work for the benefit of beings.Homage to the Three Jewels [2]Victor Lord of the Shakyas, highest teacher of gods and humanity;Precious master from Oddiyana, who unites in his single form all victors’wisdom, love, capability, and blessing;Refuge of the sacred doctrine—discourses and tantras, scriptural transmissionand realization—teaching the Victor perfectly enunciated;The spiritual community’s guides who uphold, preserve, and spread the Victor’sdoctrine: to you all, I pay homage.The fourth guiding Victor, Lord of the Shakyas, our sublime spiritual leader,son of King Shuddhodana, is the teacher of gods and humanity, chief of thedoctrine, the most kind transcendent conqueror. The Highest Continuity states:Noncomposite; spontaneous;Not realized through extraneous conditions;Replete with wisdom, love, and capability;And endowed with accomplishment of the two goals: this is the Buddha.The Reunion of Father and Child Discourse states:To lead beings to complete maturity,You, the great, skillful spiritual hero,Have appeared as the BuddhaIn one hundred million forms;Yet you will appear as many buddhasOnce again, to guide others.Our holy, enduring refuge, the sublime deathless vajra body, the precious masterfrom Oddiyana, Guru Rinpoche, unites in his single form every victor withoutexception throughout the four times (past, present, future, and timelessness)and ten directions—their minds’ wisdom that knows precisely reality’s abidingnature and the full range of what can be known; their loving nondual compassiontoward every being, like that a mother feels toward her only child; theirunhindered force and capability; and the inexhaustible blessings of their wisdombody, speech, and mind. A Litany of the Names of Gentle Splendor states:Perfect buddha in vajra posture,You assume the qualities of enlightenment’s form bodies.Illustrious buddha born from a lotus,You bear a treasury of omniscient wisdom.Sovereign, you bear myriad magical manifestations.Great Buddha, you bear the mantras of knowledge.In the modes of instruction contained in the canon’s discourses and tantras, thevictors perfectly enunciated the sublime epitome of scripture andrealization—the highest refuge, jewel of the sacred doctrine. The Treasury ofObserved Phenomena states:The Teacher’s sacred doctrine is twofold,Epitomized by scriptural transmission and realization.These are to be only upheld, expressed,And put into practice.The Highest Continuity states:Beyond imagining, duality, or concept,Pure, clear, and an effective antidote,It is free from, and frees from, attachmentAnd has the characteristics of the two truths: this is the doctrine.Freedom from attachment can be synthesizedAs the truths of cessation and of the path.Spiritual guides on the correct path who belong to the communities of the greatand lesser ways uphold the precious doctrine of the Victor, who is endowed withthe ten powers, through hearing, reflecting, and meditating upon it. Theypreserve the doctrine by removing contradictions [to logic and the Buddha’sword] and by affirming what is consistent with them; and they spread thedoctrine through teaching, debate, and composition.To these three jewels, I bow. The Highest Continuity states:Because their wisdom’s pure visionOf the inner meaning of the wisdom that knows reality’s nature and sees itsmultiplicity,The assembly of wise nonreturnersPossesses the highest qualities.The same text further states:Because they rarely appear, because they are flawless,Because they are powerful, because they are ornaments to this world,Because they are sublime,And because they do not change, they are jewels.The Design of the Basket Discourse states:When he came to the city of Varanasi, many hundreds and thousands of insectswere living in a large area of mud consisting of feces and urine. ExaltedBodhisattva Powerful All-Seeing Eyes came before them, manifested in the form ofan insect, and made the sound of the six syllables from The Design of the BasketDiscourse:To the Buddha, I bow.To the doctrine, I bow.To the spiritual community, I bow.When the beings heard those sounds and brought the three jewels to mind, thevajra of wisdom crushed their karma and mental afflictions. They becamebodhisattvas known as “Sandalwood Breath” and took rebirth in the western pureland Blissful.Homage to the Three Roots [3]The victors’ holy regents, present-day spiritual masters and those of thelineage, are repositories of sublime blessings;Sacred circles of victors, hosts of deities, are treasures of ordinary feats andsublime accomplishment;The victors’ mothers—mother and sister dakinis of the three regions—befriendthose who honor their tantric bonds;Guardians of the victors’ doctrine are authorized to perform the fouractivities: May all of you be victorious!In the perceptions of disciples, those who surpass all buddhas are the spiritualmasters authorized as the victors’ regents: present-day, incomparably kindbearers of the scepter of wisdom, masters replete with the three Buddhist codesof conduct, and the lineages’ series of spiritual masters, who are sublimerepositories of compassion and blessings. The Heart Tantra of the Vast Expanseof Space states:A qualified spiritual master is preciousEven compared to every buddha of the three times.Humble homage to a qualified masterResults in perfect enlightenment.The infinite sacred circles of peaceful and wrathful victors who appear in thefour categories of tantras’ hosts of deities resemble massive treasure vases ofboth supreme accomplishment—ultimate enlightenment—and ordinary feats, whichprovide temporal fulfillment of wishes. The Secret Essence Tantra states:I see the face of every epitome of full and complete enlightenment—Body, speech, qualities, activity, and mind—In the ten directions and four times.Its dominion is sacred and sublime.Dwelling in the sacred circle,The sacred circle spontaneously arises as the complete sacred circle,Which bears, as adornments, every sacred circle.Equal union with the complete sacred circleProduces the full sacred circle of nondual compassion.This lord protector who subdues the sacred circles of time and spaceLiberates the sacred circle of magical illusion,And enjoys the sacred circle with neither doer nor acts.The mothers who give birth to all victors, the hosts of dakinis of wisdom andactivity, and powerful celestial travelers of the three regions—below, on, andabove the ground—befriend with a mother’s love, a sister’s affection, and aservant’s respect those who honor their tantric bonds. The Dakinis’ SecretTantra, Key to the Instructions states:From the vast sacred space of the vaginaOf Transcendent Conqueror Great Queen Goddess of Bliss,Female forms diffuse in a display of manifestation—Infinite numbers of emanations and secondary emanations—To move earth and space.They are various dakinis with their entourage,Self-arisen from wisdom body, speech, and mind.Those who swore oaths to guard and protect the victors’ precious doctrine ofdiscourses and tantras, guardians who bear their promises as personalinsignia—the seventy glorious protectors, and hosts of proud spirits of theeight tribes of gods and demons—wield the authority to perform the four majoractivities—pacifying, enhancing, magnetizing, and annihilating.May all spiritual masters, deities, dakinis, and guardians crown our heads andbe supremely victorious! The Secret Essence Tantra states:Poison can be changed into medicinal nectar and transformedTo cure the four hundred and four sicknesses.Wealth will arise, the miserable realms will be purified,And anything can be transformed to something else.Space will become solid as a vajra;Even fire will ignite and burn,Then change into water, and flow down.Likewise, the worldly realm will be scattered;All will be empty; the sun and moon will fall.Drawing in, expulsion, binding, release,Nourishment, killing, defeat and victory:This meditative state does all of these.The purpose of this offering of homage is that it is very meaningful—for myself,for others, and for us both. Specifically, what I attain is this: If I sometimespraise my supreme ideals with the excellent fortune of words and meaning, I willconsider myself to be a high-minded person and undertake the conduct ofhigh-minded individuals, and will thereby complete this work. The MajorCommentary to “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Stanzas”states:Loving persons who aid othersWill not relax their effort, even if it costs them their life.Holy persons who carry a heavy burdenWill never cast it off, even in terrifying circumstances.What others attain through such homage is respect, through understanding thatthe teacher and the treatise are outstanding. Nagarjuna states:Offerings of homage to the Teacher by authors of treatisesDo not remain without effect.Therefore, faith and aspiration should be engenderedToward the Teacher and the treatise.What both attain is the completion of the cultivation of goodness and wisdom,which achieves the goals we aspire to. The Vast Enjoyment Discourse states:The full maturation of goodness bestows happiness and dispels suffering;Good persons accomplish their wishes,Vanquish demons, rapidly attain awakening,And reach the essence of the cooling peace of transcendence.The Discourse That Creates Many Buddhas states:Those who keep the guiding victors in mindAs they perform even a minor actWill travel to various higher realmsAnd attain awakening.THE RESOLVE TO COMPOSE THE TEXT [III]May I collect from all sources the meaning of the key instructions of an oceanof the Victor’s doctrine—discourses, tantras, treatises, and pith instructions;And all the intent of excellent authoritative texts of profound meaning, andmagnificent words and composition,And synthesize them within a single work, The Invaluable Treasury of BuddhistDiscourses and Tantras,And present it in twenty-five books, one hundred and one chapters, andtwenty-one hundred headings.The following resolve motivates the writing of this text:May I energetically gather together from all sources the Victor’s preciousdoctrine—the entire inconceivable canon, the cause-based way of the transcendentperfections’ discourses and the result-based vajra way’s tantras; the series oftreatises that provide commentary to them; every essential key instruction foundwithin the deep seas of oral lineages’ pith instructions; and the essentialintent of excellent authoritative texts of profound meaning and magnificentcomposition, such as the seven treasuries by Longchenpa. May I place this withina single work, The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, andelucidate it within its twenty-five books; those books’ one hundred and onemajor chapters; and the chapters’ two thousand, one hundred and seventy-nineheadings. May I present it for the benefit of fortunate persons of present andfuture generations.Bodhisattva Loving Kindness (Maitreya) explains the purpose of composingtreatises:All teachings are twofold—the canon and the treatises—The excellent speech of the Buddha and its commentaries.These collections ensure in this worldThat Shakyamuni’s doctrine will long endure.Composition can be done to familiarize the writer’s own mind with a subject.Shantideva states:Nothing original is expressed hereAnd I possess no skill in the art of prosody.Therefore, I have no thought to help others—I compose this work to familiarize my own mind with these subjects.This book should be accepted with respect, as stated in Letter from a SpiritualFriend:Wise persons honor images of the Joyful Buddha,Even those made from wood, regardless of their style.Likewise, since even this poor book of poetryExpresses the sacred doctrine, don’t revile it.The benefits of writing treatises are measureless. The Flower Ornament Discoursestates:O child of enlightened heritage! Whoever considers sentient beings’ innateconstituent enlightenment (buddha nature), and whose physical, verbal, andmental compositions are written to correctly guide those who circle within theround of rebirth has supreme, immeasurable compassion.

Calculating three hundred verses perfascicle, there are three fascicles, with 84 four-line verses remaining. Withinthe entire root text, there are 31,672 dots between syllables, divided by 7,868punctuation marks that begin and end lines.I have thus elucidated this text by presenting its books, chapters, headings,verses, fascicles, and so on, since the number of verses and fascicles in everytext belonging to discourses and tantras contained in the collections of thecanon and treatises (such as the lengthy, middle-length, and short versions ofthe Mother; that is, The Perfection of Sublime Insight) must be known in asimilar fashion.AN OUTLINE OF THE CONTENT [III]This single work has two divisions, three parts, and three main subjects.There are thirteen volumes, including a word-by-word commentary, an extensivecommentary, and an illustrated version.Four outstanding characteristics distinguish the work. It presents the place,teacher, teaching, and persons who received it.It elucidates the distinct subjects of the bases, paths, and results of thethree Buddhist codes of conduct.Its general content describes the path’s view, meditation, and conduct.Exertion in hearing this text, and reflection and meditation upon it, leads toskill in teaching, debate, and composition, and to success;Your understanding, experience, and realization will increase, and you willswiftly accomplish the two goals.The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra unites in a single workevery excellent text that facilitates experiential cultivation based on thecanon’s discourses and tantras, the treatises, and the pith instructions.This work has two divisions, that of the vast discourses and that of theprofound tantras. Its three parts—the introduction, main text, and conclusion,or the brief presentation, extensive explanation, and summary—cover three mainsubjects: a common subject, the discourses; a special subject, the tantras; anda wide-ranging subject, knowledge.In its original Tibetan edition, this work is arranged into thirteen volumes inthe following manner:Volume 1, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious jewel, contains theroot text, a treatise entitled The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discoursesand Tantras, and the outline, The Wish-Fulfilling Vine.Volume 2, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious wheel, contains theconcise commentary, The Exquisite Treasure Vase.Volume 3, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious supreme horse,constitutes the first volume on the discourses from the extensive commentary,The Elegant Ornament of the Age of Great Brahma—the introduction, a briefpresentation of the main text, and seven books of the extensive explanation:“Discipleship,” “The Transmission of Buddhism,” “Our Precious Human Life,”“Reflection on Death and Impermanence,” “The Workings of Karma,” “The Flaws ofthe Round of Rebirth,” and “Taking Refuge and the Lesser Way.”Volume 4, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious elephant, constitutesthe latter volume on the discourses—three books: “The Foundation of the MiddleWay,” “The Path of the Middle Way,” and “The Result of the Middle Way.”Volume 5, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious official, constitutesthe first volume on wide-ranging knowledge—one and a half books: the design ofthe realms of existence; the five major subjects of Buddhist culture; andastrology, from among the minor subjects of Buddhist culture.Volume 6, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious general, constitutesthe latter volume on wide-ranging knowledge—one and a half books: the other fourminor subjects of Buddhist culture, including poetry; and ways of spiritualdevelopment.Volume 7, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious queen, constitutes thefirst volume on the tantras—two and a half books: the four tantras; how thetantras arose, from explanations given in the four tantras and a mahayogatantra, The Secret Essence Tantra; and the basis of the peaceful deities.Volume 8, which resembles the great configuration of wind that underlies ourworld, constitutes the latter volume on the tantras—two and a half books: thepath and result of the peaceful deities; the wrathful deities, the conclusion ofthe tantra, and A Litany of the Names of Gentle Splendor; and the meaning of themajor transmission, anuyoga tantra.Volume 9, which resembles the great golden foundation of our world, constitutesthe first volume on the tantras of great perfection, atiyoga—two books: on theground of being, and determining the view of atiyoga.Volume 10, which resembles the great outer and inner oceans, constitutes thesecond volume on the tantras of great perfection, atiyoga—two books: meditationon cutting through the solidity of dualistic experience and meditation on directvision’s four visions.Volume 11, which resembles the massive king of mountains, constitutes the thirdvolume on the tantras of great perfection, atiyoga—three books: on conduct; theperiod between lifetimes; and the result, the place of supreme liberation.Volume 12, which resembles the circles of the sun and moon, constitutes thefirst volume of graphics covering two subjects—the common discourses andwide-ranging knowledge; and the index, entitled The Golden Key.Volume 13, which resembles the great sky, constitutes the latter volume ofgraphics covering one major subject, the special tantras.These volumes contain eighty separate texts.5 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st5]Four especially outstanding qualities distinguish this work: the generalheadings provide a faultless delineation of the work’s ground, and thusfacilitate identification of the context of any subject. In the root text, thewords and meanings are rendered in succinct verse, to facilitate memorization.In the commentaries, the words and meanings are elucidated in prose; theirextensive explanations lead to rapid understanding of the intended meaning. Thesupporting quotations from the scriptures of the Victor’s canon allay thereader’s doubts and instill confidence.Each part presents clear details of the magnificent place where a teachingoccurred; the magnificent teacher who taught it; the magnificent time theteaching was given; the magnificent entourage of disciples addressed; and thelength of each magnificent teaching of the great or lesser ways’ discourse, orexoteric or esoteric tantra. The text also presents an enumeration of the textstranslated into Tibetan, and the era and kind of individual for which specificinstruction was intended.This treatise delineates the formulated boundaries contained in the three codesof conduct in Buddhism—the vows of individual liberation, the training ofbodhisattvas, and the bonds of secret mantra. It provides a brief presentationof the nature of the foundation of each way of spiritual development of thediscourses and tantras, an extensive explanation of the spiritual paths to betraversed—their view, meditation, and conduct; and a summary of their results,an ocean of qualities. These subjects are presented attractively in thiscomplete and flawless three-part format. The treatises that spread from thisbasic one, like limbs from a body, can be exceedingly numerous.To summarize the general structure of the subjects found in the main text, itdescribes three aspects of the path: certainty in the view, experientialcultivation in meditation, and enrichment in conduct.Those who foster forceful exertion in hearing this excellent text and inreflecting and meditating upon it will be able, in the short term, tospiritually nurture fortunate persons by teaching them the words and meanings ofthe canon’s discourses and tantras, and those of the treatises; to defeat indebate those who voice wrong opinions; and to compose texts to uphold, preserve,and spread the doctrine.

The Characteristics of Qualified Spiritual Masters2. The Characteristics of Worthy Disciples3. The Stages of Spiritual Apprenticeship4. Forsaking Misleading Companions.These four chapters contain a total of thirty-seven headings.THE CHARACTERISTICS OF QUALIFIED SPIRITUAL MASTERS [I] [05_toc-title.html#sec-1]This chapter has eight parts: (1) the general characteristics of spiritualguides, (2) supreme wish-fulfilling spiritual masters, (3) spiritual masterswhose qualities are naturally complete, (4) spiritual masters liberated fromexistence, (5) spiritual masters of vast sublime insight, (6) spiritual masterswho hold the blessing of the successive lineage, (7) spiritual masters whocompassionately lead on the path, and (8) spiritual masters who reveal theultimate essential meaning.The General Characteristics of Spiritual Guides [A]The extensive explanation of this text begins with “Discipleship.”The general characteristics of spiritual guides are the following:Because holy persons lead the worldly, they resemble everyone.Because they transcend the mundane, they are unlike anyone; they areoutstanding.Their acts and conduct are pure. They guide beings skillfully.I have written this main text, the extensive explanation, in the mannerdescribed in the tantra Self-Liberated Awareness:Texts are elucidated as follows:In concise, extensive,And very extensive presentationsWhich elucidate the text’s words.Thus, Book 1, “Discipleship,” begins with a description of the generalcharacteristics of qualified spiritual masters.The distinctive mark of holy persons is that, since they lead all worldlyindividuals, their acts and conduct seem to conform to everyone they guide. Yet,since they ultimately transcend this world, they are unlike anyone else:compared to all their disciples, they are outstanding. Their acts and conductare pure, unblemished by any fault. They employ a variety of skillful means toguide all beings on the correct path. The Pattern of the Stem states:Who can be called spiritual guides? Since they lead all beings, you can seenothing discordant in them. Since they transcend this world, they have nothingin common with anyone. Because the acts they undertake are meaningful in everycircumstance, they accomplish infinite beneficial acts for others.The Discourse Requested by Maitreya states:Know that any liberation gained by hearers, solitary sages, or unsurpassablebuddhas, as well as any aggregation of the sight of wisdom, arises from relianceupon spiritual guides. Moreover, Maitreya, any measure of help or happinessexperienced by sentient beings arises from their own root of ennobling acts:know that this too arises due to spiritual guides.The General Discourse That Gathers Wisdom’s Realization states:Spiritual masters can be grouped as follows: outer, skillful spiritual masterswho cut through false embellishments in their disciples’ philosophical view;inner, kind spiritual masters who impart the profound instructions of secretmantra; secret, root spiritual masters who reveal the mind’s nature as unborn;spiritual masters of the ground of being’s nature; spiritual masters of the puremind; spiritual masters of symbolic appearances; and the human spiritual mastersof a lineage.Supreme Wish-Fulfilling Spiritual Masters [B]Supreme wish-fulfilling spiritual masters are skillful,Are imbued with supreme compassion, and have mastered great treasuries ofdiscourses and tantras.They are vessels that cross the wide sea of existence,Guides for those who have entered the path, fine gems that dispel destitution,Rivers that extinguish the fires of karma and mental afflictions, clouds thatrain the teachings,Mighty divine drums that bring joy to all beings,Healers who cure the sicknesses of the three poisons,Bright lamps that dispel the darkness of ignorance, wish-fulfilling trees thatbestow happiness,Exquisite vases that yield everything desired, new dawns of universal love,Moons that ease heartache, and mines of the riches of every quality, like thewealth god Son of Renown.Respectfully rely upon such masters.Spiritual masters exhibit expertise in accomplishing significant deeds with aminimum of difficulty. With compassion for others and without sorrow or fatigue,they are infinitely helpful. In these and other ways, they exhibit mastery ofthe vast treasury of the discourses and tantras. Aspects of their qualities canbe related using many examples. The Pattern of the Stem Discourse states:O child of enlightened heritage! Moreover, since they free us from the seas ofexistence, they are like great vessels. For those who have entered the path tofreedom, they are like guides. Since they rid existence of decline, they arelike sovereign wish-fulfilling jewels. Since they extinguish the fires of karmaand the mental afflictions, they are like rivers. Since they cause a torrentialrain of the teachings, they are like excellent clouds. Since they bring joy toall beings, they are like mighty divine drums. Since they cure the mentalafflictions’ sicknesses, they are like sovereign healers. Since they dispel alldarkness of abject ignorance, they are like lamps. Since they fulfill every hopeand desire, they are like wish-fulfilling trees. Since they yield everythingdesired, they are like exquisite vases. Since they are imbued with boundlesslove, they are like the circle of the sun. Since they ease the heartache of themental afflictions, they are like the circle of the moon. Since they bestow awealth of positive qualities, they are like the wealth god Son of Renown.Further in the same text,I could praise the spiritual guides’ qualities in full but could not finish evenafter an eon. For this reason, always rely upon spiritual guides.Spiritual Masters Whose Qualities Are Naturally Complete [C]Spiritual masters whose qualities are naturally complete are from good families,Have all senses intact, are considerate and modest,Are loving and compassionate, have vast sublime insight,And are restrained, erudite, patient, and not deceitful.These spiritual masters are born to good families, such as those of royalty, andare very modest, considerate, and conscientious. Their senses are intact andpure due to their previous cultivation of stores of goodness and wisdom. Theyfeel naturally inclined toward the great way; they are imbued with great loveand compassion. Their awakened karmic connection due to previous lifetimes’training endows them with wide-ranging innate sublime insight. Because theirdualistic mental afflictions are faint, they are restrained and patient. Theirsearch for numerous teachings has made them widely learned. Their deportment inbody, speech, and mind is naturally disciplined; thus, they are straightforwardand not deceitful. They have rejected base conduct and feel faith in correctideals. The Discourse That Gathers Wisdom’s Realization states:Born to good families, endowed with an unhurried mind, inwardly restrained,Bright and charismatic, they do not condone negative acts.Full of the inexhaustible qualities of knowledge,They are endowed with a boundless, open intellect.They are able to face difficulties, patient, and always straightforward.They are sincere, not deceitful in their conduct,And have rejected paths of frivolous preoccupations.Free from agitation and distraction, they live in seclusion:Those endowed with such qualities are worthy to be considered holy.Spiritual Masters Liberated from Existence [D]Spiritual masters liberated from existence have turned their backs on commonhuman life,Feel faint attachment to homeland, long-guarded wealth, and possessions,Believe in karma and its consequences, are circumspect in relation to ennoblingacts to adopt and corrupting acts to reject,And have abandoned hopes for this life. They accomplish what is very meaningfulfor the long term.These spiritual masters live far from their homeland, have turned their backs onworldly life, feel faint attachment to food and wealth, distinguish betweenennobling acts to adopt and corrupting acts to reject, and accomplish what isvery meaningful for the long term (that is, future lives). The Discourse ThatGathers Wisdom’s Realization states:Powerful heroes forsake their homeland,Speak truthfully, and live according to what the Buddha has said.They are like a lion, sovereign among beasts.Circumspect, their qualities magnify.They skillfully protect others from any suffering.Spiritual Masters of Vast Sublime Insight [E]Spiritual masters who know every subject of Buddhist culture are learned inphilosophical tenets’ words and meaning,Maintain exemplary view and conduct, and are never reprehensible in any way.They do not invent their own teachings but adhere to scripture and logic,Examine the capacities of students, and teach accordingly.In general, these spiritual masters have uninhibited understanding of allsubjects of knowledge, gained through training in the five major subjects ofBuddhist culture. Specifically, after thorough hearing of the gateways to thedoctrine and reflection upon them, they understand both the words and meaning ofall ways of spiritual development. In particular, their exemplary view andconduct have freed them from inferior, mistaken philosophies. Since theirunderstanding has emerged from the treasure chest of scripture and reasoning,they neither trivialize nor invent teachings. They thoughtfully examinestudents’ intellectual propensities before leading them to enter the doctrine’straditional paths. They distinguish between the spiritual and the mundane, thusskillfully put an end to negative forces and mistaken paths. The Pattern of theStem Discourse states:Those known as spiritual guides are they who have renounced corrupting acts andwho act nobly. They flawlessly present the doctrine as it is and actaccordingly. They possess the seven treasures of exalted beings,6[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st6] seek awakening, and lead others to thatattainment.Spiritual Masters Who Hold the Blessing of the Successive Lineage [F]Spiritual masters who preserve the lineage of accomplished masters have receivedthe aural lineage’s profound instructions.They hold the tradition; thus, they are skillful in accomplishing the two goals.They exert themselves in spiritual practice, have attained accomplishments, andare even able to transform others’ perceptions.They have inherited the discourses’ and tantras’ transmissions, and guard thetantric bonds purely.These spiritual masters pleased their own spiritual masters and guides, and nowpreserve the lineage of accomplished masters. They mined the treasury of theirmasters’ wisdom mind and now wield the aural lineage’s profound instructions.They witnessed the customs of their predecessors and are now skillful in ways toaccomplish goals for others’ good as well as their own. Their constant exertionin spiritual practice has led to their attainment of various kinds ofaccomplishment. The blessing of their predecessors has entered their being; theyare thus able to transform others’ perceptions. By the victors’ blessing, theyinherited the transmissions of the discourses and tantras. Their great fortunein secret mantra leads them to guard purely the designated tantric bonds. VajraMagical Illusion states:The characteristics of spiritual masters of secret mantra are these:Well-educated, endowed with vast sublime insight,Of sure realization of the transmissions’ intent,Not striving to acquire material objects,Accepting of hardship with little sorrow or fatigue,Endowed with many pith instructions, liberated from the path,Skillful in logic, knowledgeable in the signs of meditative heat,Imbued with the awakened mind and pervasive compassion,Inheritor of the tantras, skillful in spiritual practice,Endowed with a repository of instruction, the streams of transmission arecomplete within them—Their own minds are liberated and they strive diligently for others’ welfare.Spiritual Masters Who Compassionately Lead on the Path [G]Spiritual masters have trained in the awakened mind and continually help others.The signs of having received blessing are that they are able to bless others’experience;They have experience of the view, meditation, and conduct and their results; andthey are proficient in the signs that indicate attainment of meditative heat.They are powerful, can eliminate all hindrances, and guide others skillfully.These spiritual masters have trained in the great way; thus, whatever they doserves others. Their own spiritual masters’ blessings have entered them; thus,they are able to bless others’ experience. Their training in the meaning of theabiding nature allows them to exhibit signs of meditative heat in the experienceof the view, meditation, conduct, and result. Their awareness has reached thevital point; thus, their power and force can eliminate demons and hinderingspirits. Skillful in miracles, they overpower mistaken views. Skillful inhelping others, they guide beings on the path. The Highest Certain Expressionstates:They are endowed with a stable awakened mind, are skillful,And possess a full measure of meditative heat in the experience of suchness.Forceful, and undeterred by hindering spirits,They pleased their blessed spiritual mastersAnd thereby became vajra masters.Spiritual Masters Who Reveal the Ultimate Essential Meaning [H]Connection to spiritual masters who reveal the ultimate meaning brings you tothe profound path.They introduce the essential meaning, the body of ultimate enlightenment, andreveal pith instructions to enrich that experience.Consummately realized, they accompany disciples to the abiding nature, theground of being.They skillfully transform any circumstance into the path and are masterful inliberating others’ streams of being.The expanse of their wisdom minds spans the sky; their meditative states shinebrilliantly like the sun;Their wisdom is deep as an ocean; and their nondual compassion flows like amighty river.Unmoved by distraction, like snow-covered mountains, they are as steadfast asmountains.Unsullied by existence, like lotuses, they dwell in equanimity like a parent.Replete with qualities like treasures, they lead beings like monarchs.For difficult beings, they surpass any buddha.These spiritual masters have unlimited nondual compassion: any connection youcan make with them will prove meaningful. Skilled in the stages of spiritualdevelopment, they set you on your preferred path to liberation. Their skill inteaching the path from the beginning according to disciples’ interests allowsthem to lead those of an average degree of acumen to the practice of ennoblingacts. On the path of freedom, they use personal guidance to introduce you todirect sight of the innate body of ultimate enlightenment as your own nature.They greatly increase disciples’ qualities by means of profound enrichmentthrough training in the energy of meditation. Their consummate mastery ofultimate realization allows them to foster disciples’ realization of the truestate of buddha nature. Proficient in the profound path of skillful techniques,they transform any circumstance into the spiritual path. Their mastery ofvarious profound instructions makes them skillful in liberating others’ streamsof being. Because they have wide-ranging sight, learning, and experience, theyare adept at eliminating demons and mistaken paths. Their mastery of the highestsummits of wisdom mind’s realization gives them skill in liberating any being’sstream of being. Other metaphors of their qualities are stated in The FlowerOrnament Discourse:O children of the victors! This kind of spiritual guide’s qualities areunlimited. The breadth of their nondual compassion is wide, like the sky. Theircollections of retention mantras and meditative states are plentiful, like theplanets and stars. Their compassion is boundless, like a great brimming lake.Their kindness is measureless, like a river. They are unmoved by distraction,like snow-covered mountains. They never stray from the nature of suchness, likeSupreme Mountain. Although they live in mundane existence, its faults do nottouch them, like large lotuses. Their love is unhindered and unbiased, like thatof parents. Their qualities are unlimited, like mines of jewels. Theirliberation of all who circle within the round of rebirth is like a transcendentbuddha’s. Their collection of qualities is boundless, infinite.The Pristine Sky Discourse states:Ananda! Transcendent buddhas do not appear to all sentient beings. Spiritualguides appear to all, present the doctrine, and plant the seeds of liberation.Therefore, consider spiritual guides as superior to the transcendent buddhas.The Songs of Realization states:Vajra masters are the root of all accomplishment.THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WORTHY DISCIPLES [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-2]This chapter has two parts: (1) the characteristics of disciples to be rejectedand (2) the characteristics of disciples to be accepted.The Characteristics of Disciples to Be Rejected [A]Unworthy candidates to be rejectedHave poor faith, consideration, modesty, compassion, character,Nature, behavior, and fortune. Their acts and mental afflictions are coarse.They disregard ennobling acts and corrupting acts, vows and tantric bonds. Theirpositive influences are faint.They are very foolish, small-minded, difficult to please, bad tempered, andargumentative.They harbor the intent to sell to others the teachings they receive.The enormity of bad effects of not examining a prospective disciple harmsBuddhism.Unfortunate disciples are candidates that are faulty in many respects. Theirfaith and modesty are faint, as are their consideration and compassion. Theircharacter and nature are negative. Their behavior and fortune are poor. Theirminds and mental afflictions are coarse. They violate their training andsuitable choices between ennobling acts and wrongdoing; they do not honor theirvows and tantric bonds. They do not seal the mental afflictions’ doors and aredeluded in how to counteract the mental afflictions. Their knowledge is limited,yet they are difficult to please. Only their bad temper and argumentative speechincrease. They are naturally diligent in mundane activity. They sell theBuddha’s spirit, undermine the doctrine, and betray the spiritual community.If such persons seek a spiritual master’s instruction, their lack ofpeacefulness harms everyone and they despise everyone: they are like hunters.Even if they decide to listen to a certain teaching from a specific instructor,they see him or her as having many specific faults: they see masters as muskdeer. They see teachings given others as valuable musk, which they wish toacquire, boast about, and sell to others. All these acts cause their presentlife to be ill-fated and lead to future rebirth in hell. A Commentary to “TheArray of the Three Tantric Bonds Tantra” states:Contempt for secret mantra’s vajra masters,Exchanging for wealth the instruction received,Not honoring the tantric bonds of the wisdom clans—These acts cause this life to be short,Glory and good fortune to decline,Suffering from dakinis’ punishment,And a later fall to the miserable realms.The Characteristics of Disciples to Be Accepted [B]Fortunate disciples are endowed with strong faith, energy, and sublime insight.They exercise care, mindfulness, and thoughtfulness. They honor their vows andtantric bonds.They do not disobey commands; they are peaceful, disciplined, and loving.They are open-minded, mentally stable, and have strong devotion and pureperception.Fortunate disciples are endowed with faith, energy, and vast sublime insight.They exercise caution and mindfulness. They honor tantric bonds and vows. Theynever disobey the spiritual master’s commands; they are peaceful, disciplined,and loving. They are open-minded, mentally stable, and have strong devotion andpure perception. Self-Manifest Awareness Tantra states:These disciples are endowed with the power of faith, strong diligence, and acutediscernment.They have no grasping and attachment;Are very reverential; and practice secret mantra.Their nonconceptual minds remain undistracted.They are energetic in spiritual practice while honoring their tantric bonds.The General Discourse That Gathers Wisdom’s Realization states:I make every offering to the holy ones who have these eight qualities:Faith without sadness or fatigue,Flexibility without stubbornness or arrogance,No greed toward possessions,Unhesitant service,Honest, undeceptive speech,A mind free from flattery,Undeluded sublime insight,And undefiled, superior intention.Complete mastery of the bounds of training dictated by holy beingsLiberates your stream of being;You travel unimpeded in the domain of all knowledge.When the knots of your stream of being are untied,You soar like a bird in the sky of sublime insight.THE STAGES OF SPIRITUAL APPRENTICESHIP [III] [05_toc-title.html#sec-3]This chapter has two parts: (1) the reasons to rely upon spiritual masters and(2) how to rely upon spiritual masters.The Reasons to Rely upon Spiritual Masters [A]This section has six parts: (1) spiritual masters provide lastingly usefuladvice, (2) spiritual masters teach correct conduct, (3) cultivation of goodnessand wisdom accelerates, (4) protection from suffering, (5) qualities flourish,and (6) gain of the rare opportunity to receive profound teachings.Spiritual Masters Provide Lastingly Useful Advice [1]There are six purposes for remaining inseparable from spiritual masters and tocontinually rely upon them:Spiritual masters provide profound and lastingly useful advice.Parents, local rulers, and others can teach you to perform this life’sactivities, but for excellent, lastingly useful advice and for training in thesacred Buddhist doctrine, you must rely upon spiritual masters. The DiscourseThat Gathers Wisdom’s Realization states:They who show the path illuminated by great exaltationTo those wandering here in darknessAre the great refuge—spiritual masters:No one else can provide such refuge.Spiritual Masters Teach Correct Conduct [2]They relieve suffering by teaching discernment in relation to ennobling acts andwrongdoing.They open disciples’ eyes to sublime insight and illuminate the path to freedom.Rely upon spiritual masters because they teach you how to cultivate the cause ofhappiness, ennobling acts, and to reject the causes of suffering, wrongdoing.They dispel the darkness of ignorance, illuminate sublime insight, and revealthe path to freedom. The Hundred Verses on Illusion states:They exhibit every jewel without exceptionFound in the vast treasury of noble qualities.They eradicate every mental afflictionAnd lead to the attainment of the highest result.Serve them much betterThan the ruler who has authority in your land.Show them much stronger love and affectionThan you do toward your kind parents who gave you this body.Cultivation of Goodness and Wisdom Accelerates [3]Only spiritual masters can provide the highest supportFor the swift cultivation of goodness and wisdom.For the accomplishment of awakening, you need to cultivate the two stores ofgoodness and wisdom; therefore, rely upon spiritual masters, since there is nohigher field than they for such cultivation. The Ocean of Wisdom Tantra states:Whoever is fortunateTo be skillful in aiding the spiritual masters’ worksPerforms deeds more meaningfulThan rendering homage to the buddhas of the three timesDuring ten million, six hundred thousand eons.The Flaming Vajra Tantra states:The goodness of offering incalculable serviceTo immeasurable hundred thousands of principal and surrounding buddhasIn inexpressible numbers of buddhas’ pure landsCannot be compared to a fraction of the goodnessOf offerings such as gifts of goldTo spiritual masters, to their inner circle,Or to their close circle, including their servants.Protection from Suffering [4]Because spiritual masters give refuge from all the sufferings of life and themiserable existences,It is worthwhile to rely upon them as your foremost refuge.Supreme spiritual masters provide sure refuge from the round of rebirth ingeneral, from the miserable existences in particular, and specifically fromevery suffering, major or minor. Therefore, rely upon them as a holy refuge. TheKing of Illusion states:As providers of sure refuge from the dangers of the round of rebirth,And as supreme guides to the transcendence of sorrow,There is none other than spiritual masters.Qualities Flourish [5]For those without qualities, spiritual masters cause ordinary and special noblequalitiesTo develop and to flourish.For beginners without any positive qualities whatsoever, reliance upon spiritualmasters stimulates ordinary qualities, such as understanding the subjects ofBuddhist culture and conventional activity; uncommon qualities, such as thoseborn from hearing the doctrine and reflection upon it; and special qualities,such as meditative experience and realization, which culminate in the state ofenlightenment. Since such qualities arise from spiritual masters, you shouldrely upon them. The Discourse Showing the Transcendent Buddhas’ InconceivableMysteries states:A bodhisattva relies upon spiritual masters and thus perfectly completes everypositive quality.Gain of the Rare Opportunity to Receive Profound Teachings [6]It is rare in this time of degeneration to find someone who surpasses spiritualmastersAs teachers of the deep and wide-ranging nectar of the Buddhist doctrine.In this time of the five degenerations’ proliferation, no one surpassesspiritual masters as teachers of the deep and wide-ranging supreme nectar of theBuddhist doctrine. Therefore, you should rely upon them. The Precious Tantra ofMatrix of Mystery states:Spiritual masters are the equals of all buddhas.Since they reveal the spiritual path to any sentient being,They are more exalted than the Buddha himself.How to Rely upon Spiritual Masters [B]This section has nine parts: (1) search for qualified spiritual masters whereverthey live, (2) realize that whatever spiritual masters do is guided by theirwisdom mind’s realization, (3) rely upon them considering various examples, (4)please masters with material offerings, (5) please masters physically, (6)please masters verbally, (7) please masters mentally, (8) please masters byobeying their commands, and (9) the benefits of discipleship.Search for Qualified Spiritual Masters Wherever They Live [1]In any country or region qualified spiritual masters live,Strive to find them as if searching for rare food or wealth.In any country or region qualified spiritual masters live, strive to find themas you would search for very necessary food or riches. Search with pure faithand humility, as it is very important to not bungle your initial connection witha master. A discourse [The Discourse Requested by Vishnu] states:In searching for a spiritual guide, don’t cherish your body or life;don’t cling to various material objects; don’t be attached to wealth;don’t wish for praise and service: give them all up and search!Realize That Whatever Spiritual Masters Do Is Guided by Their Wisdom Mind’sRealization [2]Whatever spiritual masters do—gently or forcefully, meaningful or not, major orminor—Is guided by their wisdom mind’s realization.During the stages of judging a worthy vessel, genuine spiritual masters overtlyexamine prospective disciples. To greedy persons, they display strong desire forpossessions. To complete the cultivation of goodness of those who make smallofferings, they ask for things. To persons with little patience, they makeunpleasant, disparaging remarks. To those who are proud of having reduced theirpossessions and involvements, they show themselves to be busy and concerned withlong-term projects.In brief, although they are not subject to delusion, they display to othersvarious contradictory forms of behavior. They present themselves as persons whodo not examine their body and speech, thus making it seem that their minds aredeluded. They thereby determine whether or not the state of the prospectivedisciples’ faith is stable.It is impossible to fathom holy masters’ acts and behavior. Although they act ina multitude of ways, they do so to guide beings: their wisdom mind never straysfrom the nature of reality. Know any of the masters’ acts to be the display oftheir wisdom minds’ prodigious blessing; develop pure perception. The Discourseof Ten Qualities states:Develop the perception that they wake you from folly’s slumber. Develop theperception that they pull you from sinking in the mire of the round of rebirth.Develop the perception that they show you the excellent path after you haveentered an evil one. Develop the perception that they free you from the fettersof the prison of mundane existence. Develop the perception that they are doctorswho cure you from a chronic, oppressive illness. Develop the perception thatthey are rain clouds that quell your mental afflictions’ blazing fire.Rely upon Spiritual Masters Considering Various Examples [3]Rely upon masters as you would, for example, ascetics, powerful guardians,warriors, rulers,Teachers, healers, or helpful companions.If you very diligently rely upon non-Buddhist ascetics who practice meaninglessrites, why not please spiritual masters who reveal the path to liberation? Ifyou honor powerful guardians, lords, leaders, and others, why not offer homageto spiritual masters who provide refuge from the round of rebirth’s sufferings?If you rely upon warriors who free you from dangerous paths, why not rely uponspiritual masters who liberate you from mistaken spiritual paths? If you offerto the ruler your wealth, music, parasols, and so on, why not offer service tospiritual masters who bestow what is very meaningful for the long term? If youserve teachers of crafts, why not serve those who teach the path to theaccomplishment of enlightenment? If you must give gifts to a healer who curesyour sicknesses, why not make offerings to spiritual masters who rid you of thefive poisons’ chronic ailments? If you show consideration to companions who havehelped you for a time in sharing food or money, why not serve spiritual masterswho reveal the wish-fulfilling jewel of your innate constituent enlightenment,buddha nature?With these thoughts, if you correctly offer service to masters in faith andrespect, the infallible interdependent connection created by this act willensure that others will in turn genuinely respect and honor you. The Pattern ofthe Stem Discourse states:Spiritual guides have been born within the Buddha’s wisdom clan, like eldestchildren of a universal monarch. Because they engender in you the positivequalities of the enlightened heritage, they are like mothers. They accomplishwide-ranging helpful acts, like fathers. They protect you from wrongdoing, likemothers. They teach all forms of training, like masters. They have you enter thepath of the transcendent perfections, like guides. They cure the mentalafflictions’ sicknesses, like healers. They protect you from danger, likewarriors. They liberate you from the river of the round of rebirth, likeboatmen. All conduct of bodhisattvas depends upon spiritual guides.Please Masters with Material Offerings [4]Offer without attachment food, clothing, material things, jewels,Grain, wealth, fine houses, fields, horses, vehicles,All your special wealth—your children, spouse, or servants;Sacred representations of wisdom body, speech, and mind; and the finestmedicine.Offer spiritual masters the following outer material objects: particularlydelicious and nutritious food; multicolored clothing; whatever tools are usefulfor the work they have begun; precious metals and jewels, such as gold, silver,copper, iron, turquoise, coral, and pearls; fine houses and seats; land, such ashills, forests, and fields; vehicles, such as horses, elephants, and chariots;your special wealth, such as your children, spouse, or servants; sacredrepresentations of wisdom body, speech, and mind; and medicine that revitalizesthe body’s constituent elements. Offer whatever you have without cherishing it;you should please spiritual masters with gifts of material things. The GreatDesign states:To please spiritual masters, offer these as gifts:Horses, elephants, wealth of jewels,Your kingdom, your children, your spouse,Gold, silver, copper, iron, and gems,Food and drink, entertainment, clothing,Medicinal essences, grain, flowers,Teachings, and material possessions.Such acts will permit you to achieve nowEvery accomplishment without hindrance.However, if you do not own such things,Present masses of offerings from your mindAs many times as the years you have lived:This creates the same goodness as the previous material offerings.If one word of the doctrine cannot be repaid by offering respectful service forthe length of an eon, what can be said about repaying the masters’ everykindness? The Discourse Requested by Urga states:To receive a reading transmission or a text for recitation of a verse pertainingto such subjects as the six transcendent perfections or the bodhisattva path ofthe twofold cultivation of goodness and wisdom, some bodhisattvas might servethe master who gives it with honor and offerings for as many eons as there areletters in the text, yet the respect due the master would still remainincomplete. What then needs to be said concerning respect due when the entireteaching is bestowed?The Garland of Tongues of Fire Tantra states:However, if a wise BuddhistBecomes bereft of food and clothingIn making offerings to the vajra master,This can be compared to offering a celebration a thousand timesTo infinite numbers of fully ordained personsFilling an entire kingdom.Offering food, or even just clothing,Just once to spiritual mastersHas goodness hundreds of times more, inexpressible in words.Pleasing Masters Physically [5]This section has two parts: (1) pleasing masters physically and (2) displeasingacts to renounce.Pleasing Masters Physically [a]Physically, bow, present offerings, and perform circumambulations.Do what you are asked on the masters’ behalf.Serve, wait upon, attend, and obey spiritual masters.Protect them from fire or water, ravines, wild animals, and enemies.Perform all forms of activity, major and minor, such as prostrations, presentingvarious offerings, circumambulations, and the tasks you are asked to do on themasters’ behalf. Respectfully serve, wait upon, and attend spiritual masters byperforming the many duties of a servant, such as preparing their seat, and soon. Always protect them from such dangers as fire, water, ravines, wild animals,and enemies. Gentle Splendor’s Wisdom Ornament Discourse states:Sons and daughters of the enlightened heritage! The mass of goodness gained fromservice offered to spiritual guides by any person endowed with sublime faith isunlimited and infinite, even when compared to having made offerings to allbuddhas who lived during eons as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.Displeasing Acts to Renounce [b]Wrong physical behavior includes carelessness, disrespect, scowling,Frowning, clapping the hands, turning your side toward the master, stretchingthe arms or legs,Lying down, fighting, frivolity, playing games, spitting or cleaning your nose,Or stepping over the masters’ hair or clothes.Wrong physical behavior that must be renounced in the masters’ presence includesvarious forms of carelessness, disrespect, staring and scowling, frowning,clapping the hands or snapping the fingers, turning your back, sitting sideways(that is, not facing them), stretching the arms or legs, lying down, fightingwith others, frivolity and playing games, spitting or cleaning your nose,stepping over masters’ hair or clothes, seat or horse, and so on; walking infront of, to the right of, or behind masters; or measuring their body. TheSacred Yogini Tantra states:Who steps on a master’s pillow, and the like,Will climb the mountain of swords in the hells.Who measures a spiritual master’s heightWill be pierced by three hundred spears.Pleasing Masters Verbally [6]This section has two parts: (1) pleasing masters verbally and (2) displeasingacts to renounce.Pleasing Masters Verbally [a]Make requests with pleasant words, praise the masters,Use polite language, speak supportively of what the masters have said,Pray to them, relate the masters’ qualities and life stories to others,Answer honestly, take refuge, and examine your own speech.Verbally, in whatever you ask spiritual masters, articulate your words and use apleasant tone with neither too many nor too few words. Praise the masters’impressive body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity in ways that areconsistent with the masters’ character. Be polite and express yourself in amanner supportive of whatever the masters have said. Pray to the masters duringthe six periods of the day with intense faith and respect. In appreciation ofyour own good fortune, relate in detail to others the masters’ stores ofqualities and their life stories. Answer honestly any question they ask. Takerefuge in the masters. Always examine your own speech when addressing them. TheCloud of Jewels Discourse states:Having performed service, stay on your seatAnd offer expressions of praise and support.Displeasing Acts to Renounce [b]Wrong verbal behavior includes lies, slander, idle talk,Or using harsh language in the presence of spiritual masters, disobeying theircommands, and talking back.At all times in general, and in masters’ presence in particular, it isinappropriate to accumulate such negative verbal karma as lies, slander, harshlanguage, various forms of idle meaningless talk, disobedience toward anycommands, talking back, words of annoyance, confidential malicious speech, orprovocation with the intent to test what reply the masters give. SecretEnjoyment states:Who ridicules the masters behind their backsWill suffer in Vajra Hell.Don’t even slander in jest:Completely control the faults of speech.Pleasing Masters Mentally [7]This section has two parts: (1) pleasing masters mentally and (2) displeasingacts to renounce.Pleasing Masters Mentally [a]Mentally, remember the spiritual masters’ kindness and qualities.Develop the attitude that the masters, difficult to meet, are greater than theBuddha.When recalling their acts, tremble and cry.Consider that to see, hear, recall, or be touched by spiritual masters is a verymeaningful event.Mentally, consider that for beings such as us, whom previous buddhas were unableto subdue, these spiritual masters are exceedingly kind. The qualities of theirbody, speech, and mind surpass those of the buddhas since they are the foremostleaders who guide the difficult beings of this degenerate time.Think that your meeting masters now is due to your cultivation of goodnessduring previous lifetimes; apart from the present moment, it will be difficultto repeatedly meet such persons. When recalling the character of their deeds andlife, you tremble, your hair stands on end, and your eyes fill with tears.Consider that to see their faces just once, to hear their voices once, to heartheir names, or to have them touch your head once purifies a great mass ofwrongdoing and fills inconceivable stores of goodness. Therefore, developintense joy. A tantra states:The ultimate act to gain accomplishmentIs to please spiritual masters.The Pattern of the Stem Discourse states:To keep spiritual guides inseparable from your mind accomplishes all goals.Displeasing Acts to Renounce [b]Wrong mental attitudes include lack of faith, wrong views, anger, criticalattention,Contempt, competitiveness, pride, and coveting. Renounce these acts.These attitudes incur immeasurable faults: lack of faith in the masters, wrongviews, anger toward their commands, critical attention to their acts orbehavior, deeply felt contempt, jealousy, competitiveness, pride (such asthinking that your own family or clan is superior to theirs), coveting theirpossessions, and so on. The Tantra That Turns Back the Hordes states:Disputes with spiritual masters or their entourageIn anger and animosityLead to suffering in the hell of Uninterrupted TormentFor as many eons as there are atoms in a pure land.Particularly, liberation on the path of secret mantra is reached through theessence of being itself; thus, the nature of those engaged in the fearlesstantric conduct of awareness, or in the conduct of integration is impossible tofathom. In Land of the Exalted (India), the great brahmin Rahula appeared toother brahmins to have allowed his caste-ordained behavior to decline, to haverenounced the conduct of an elder, and to live with a woman who worked withbamboo. Many persons, including the king, censured him for this behavior.Shavari lived as a hunter together with a woman. Darikapa lived as a servant toa prostitute. Vyadalipa killed many birds in towns. The low-caste Anangavajralived with a pig-herding woman and angrily beat her. Vinapa appeared to haveattachment to his guitar. Lilivajra presented herself as a passionate woman whosold alcohol. The master Lavapa was seen as a teacher who declared thatstupidity was the path. Indrabhuti was seen as a lustful person. Jalandharivapassed his days in childish play. Tillipa roasted live fish, sometimes poundedsesame seeds, and sometimes feigned insanity. Kukuraja led a pack of dogs. Theaccomplished master Tantipa lived as a weaver. Gayavati lived as a villagemusician. The master who only ate ghuntriri birds he killed was named after hisprey. Krishnavajra saw the female Transcendent Conqueror as a fisherwomancarrying a net on her shoulder. Shri Singha saw Manjushrimitra as a marriedlayperson who plowed the fields. Such examples are so numerous as to beimpossible to recount them all.Please Masters by Obeying Their Commands [8]When the order arrives, “Devote yourself single-mindedly to meditationpractice!”Stay in seclusion, abandon all forms of busyness,And single-mindedly day and night raise the banner of essential spiritualpractice.Become past masters’ representative and actualize the fruit of accomplishment.When holy spiritual masters order, “Engage in meditation practice!” and you doas they command, this constitutes the best among all offerings. This is thepurpose for which the Buddha and spiritual masters, themselves buddhas insuccession before our masters, have appeared in this world to impart thedoctrine. Therefore, listen attentively to them and act with discernment inrelation to acts to undertake or to relinquish. Don’t be content with mereunderstanding: cultivate your experience in the doctrine’s meaning and practice.Experiential cultivation must not be an empty façade: practice to merge your ownstream of being with the teachings. Moreover, since skillful means and sublimeinsight are indivisibly united, do not let your spiritual life become a mereaspiration: diligent spiritual practice has unlimited benefits. The Discourse ofthe Collection of Bodhisattva Teachings states:When you begin to cultivate the experience of the spiritual master’s profoundinstructions, your noble intention brings ten qualities to full perfection ininexpressible numbers of billion, million, and hundred thousand units: yourpowers increase to that degree, that many blessings arise, your obscurations arepurified to that degree, you pass beyond that many demons, you enter that manygateways to the doctrine, you complete that many stores of goodness and wisdom,your conduct is purified to that degree, your aspirations are accomplished tothat degree, and you attain that many qualities. In brief, you perfect all thequalities of enlightenment.Such attainment depends on spiritual masters and arises from them.The Benefits of Discipleship [9]Inconceivable numbers of benefits accrue from correct discipleship:Every fault, shortcoming, suffering, and weakness ends.A great treasure overflows with favorable qualities, talents, meditativeexperiences, and realization.You bring help and happiness to Buddhism and to beings.Inconceivable benefits accrue from correct discipleship: all collections offaults and shortcomings are dispelled; every suffering and weakness ends; agreat treasure overflows with favorable qualities, meditative experiences, andrealization—you become a sublime individual who brings help and happiness toBuddhism and beings. Moreover, all your doubts are resolved; the web of yourdiscursive thought is cut; you are pulled from the mire of the round of rebirth;the darkness of ignorance lifts; you gain the essence of accomplishment; wisdomis illuminated; you train in seeing the buddhas’ pure lands; you travel to purelands; you accomplish clairvoyance and miraculous powers; in all lifetimes, youmeet spiritual guides; and you see the buddhas’ perceptions: such benefits areinfinite. The Wheel of Flames Tantra states:The qualities that arise from discipleshipExceed the number of the atomsIn measureless worlds of the cosmos,Hence the name “the highest” (that is, “lama”).FORSAKING MISLEADING COMPANIONS [IV] [05_toc-title.html#sec-4]This chapter has seven parts: (1) the harm in befriending fools; (2) the harm inbefriending the faithless and apathetic; (3) the harm in befriending those ofthe lesser way; (4) the harm in befriending those without view, meditation, andmeditative states; (5) the harm in befriending those whose five poisonous mentalafflictions are intense; (6) the harm in befriending those who feel nodisengagement from the round of rebirth; and (7) why you must forsake misleadingcompanions and the benefits of doing so.The Harm in Befriending Fools [A]Misleading companions to be forsaken are described as follows:Befriending fools diverts you from the correct path.Deficient in knowledge, you unwittingly lead an ordinary, meaningless life.Befriending fools is a grave mistake. In general, wandering in the round ofrebirth arises from the ignorance due to a foolish lack of knowledge. Karma andmental afflictions as well emerge and spread from ignorance. Specifically, ifyou are to accomplish awakening on the path of freedom, relying exclusively onunknowledgeable teachers or spiritual masters entails a great loss, sincealthough you hope to gain liberation, you have taken the wrong path.Wrong paths can be made to seem Buddhist. On such paths, the claim, “The poisonof hearing the doctrine’s terminology and reflection upon it will prevent theattainment of enlightenment” belittles the canon’s scriptures. The claim, “Anyact one has done furthers the round of rebirth; meditate without activity, likethe sky” belittles the path of twofold cultivation. The claim, “On buddhas’ orbodhisattvas’ levels, their powers, fearlessness, bodies of enlightenment,wisdoms, and design of the pure lands’ ornaments constitutes provisionalmeaning; in fact, there is nothing whatsoever” belittles the result of thespiritual path. The claim, “The qualities of the abiding state, buddha nature,the ever-present luminosity the Buddha described, are provisional meaningintended for immature persons, whereas this fresh, common experience of presentdeluded thought is itself the abiding nature” belittles the ground of being. Theclaim, “The collection of stages, paths, and meditative states are conventionaltruth but do not in fact exist” belittles the qualities of liberation.These days some persons are false semblances of spiritual teachers, in discordwith any discourse, tantra, pith instruction, scripture, or reasoning. Many suchself-proclaimed “spiritual leaders” have appeared: they are fools, their mindsuntrained by either extensive hearing of the doctrine or reflection upon it, yetthey appear majestic as they speak many words that act as demonic influences forthe doctrine. They owe their position to nonhuman demons who obstruct faithfulpersons’ passage to liberation. Demons have blessed them with an entourage andseeming goodness, as described in The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse.When you befriend those ignorant of grammar, you become contaminated by theirlack of knowledge of the connection between words and meanings. When youbefriend those ignorant of healing, you become contaminated by their lack ofknowledge of how to cure sicknesses due to imbalances in the collection of thebody’s constituents. When you befriend those ignorant of logical axioms, youbecome contaminated by their lack of knowledge of the gradual rejection of whatis illogical and acceptance of what is logical. When you befriend those ignorantof construction skills, you become contaminated by their lack of success innecessary, short-term projects. When you befriend those ignorant of Buddhistknowledge, you become contaminated by their lack of knowledge of spiritualpractice on the excellent path to the temporary, uplifted happiness of thehigher realms or to the ultimate, certain liberation of awakening. TheMindfulness Discourse states:Misleading companions are the roots of desire, anger, and stupidity; thus, theyresemble a poisonous trunk of a tree. They constitute a grave fault.The Harm in Befriending the Faithless and Apathetic [B]When you befriend the faithless and apathetic,You neglect meditation practice; your humility and devotion fade.When you befriend those without faith in spiritual masters or Buddhism, cloudsof blessings vanish, and you become contaminated by their mistaken separationfrom the path of freedom. When you befriend those who are indolent andcomplacent, this casts a shadow on your ennobling acts and contaminates you withthe increase of corrupting acts. When you befriend those who do not makeofferings to the three jewels with faith and enthusiasm, you become contaminatedby the decline of Buddhism’s common customs. When you befriend those who do notpractice the teachings with faith and enthusiasm, you become contaminated by theclosed door to the increase of the twofold cultivation of goodness and wisdom.When you befriend those who do not rely upon the spiritual community with faithand enthusiasm, you become contaminated by the oppressive faults of ordinarypersons. When you befriend those who do not meditate upon the wisdom deitieswith faith and enthusiasm, you become contaminated by the hope foraccomplishment by means of mental aspirations alone. When you befriend those whodo not invoke nor offer to the dakinis with faith and enthusiasm, you becomecontaminated by not accomplishing the messengers of enlightened activity.Therefore, I advise you to forsake these companions. The Mindfulness Discoursestates:Misleading companions constitute the principal obstacle to all ennoblingqualities. You should forsake befriending them, talking to them, or evenallowing their shadow to fall on you.The Harm in Befriending Those of the Lesser Way [C]When you befriend those of the lesser way, you yearn for peace and happiness foryourself alone,And you abandon significant acts for others’ benefit.When you befriend those of the lesser way mentality, you apply yourself tospiritual practice only for your own benefit. You yearn for peace and happinessfor yourself alone, and you abandon undertaking other significant acts for thedoctrine and beings’ benefit. The Discourse Requested by Ocean of Intellectstates:Evil companions in the guise of spiritual guides present teachings that containinstruction drawn from the ways of the hearers and solitary sages. Theydiscourage your intention to cultivate goodness. They teach strict seclusion andapplication to few activities. They rely upon and honor those who do not followthe great way’s meaningful written works. They discourage your intention to leadsentient beings to full maturity through the four material means to gatherothers. They discourage your intention to accept the totality of the sacredBuddhist doctrine.The Harm in Befriending Those without View, Meditation, and Meditative States[D]When you befriend those without correct views, meditation, or meditative states,those whose training has lapsed,Those who persist in ordinary deluded thinking, those who are acquisitive,Loners, or those who are nihilist or literalist,You only manage to talk about Buddhism without any meaningful results.When you befriend those without realization of the wisdom mind’s view, youbecome contaminated by their mistaken estrangement from the nature of reality.When you befriend those who have allowed their vows and tantric bonds to lapse,you lose your vows through contamination by the influence of their ruinedtantric bonds. When you befriend those who persist in ordinary, deluded, commonthinking, you become contaminated by their mistaken straying from the meaning ofthe abiding nature. When you befriend acquisitive spiritual guides, you loseyour store of food and clothing. When you befriend those who delight in livingin seclusion without the essential teachings, the Buddha’s doctrinedeteriorates. When you befriend those who talk vainly concerning emptiness, youbecome contaminated by their mistaken disregard of causality. When you befriendthose without meditative experience who are attached to the literal meanings ofwords, you become contaminated by their mistaken pleasure in meaningless terms.When you befriend those with theorizing, literal minds, you become numb toexperiential cultivation. When you befriend those without training in upliftingtheir minds to awakening, you become contaminated by their mistaken disregard ofthe altruistic act of gathering disciples. When you befriend those who considerthat purity and liberation arise in a process of cause and effect, you becomecontaminated by their mistaken disparagement of secret mantra. When you befriendthe small-minded who are attached to form, you become contaminated by theirfault of considerable distance from the profound nature of reality. The Treasuryof Enlightenment Discourse states:Worldly enemies can merely take your life: they can only force you to leave thisbody behind, but they cannot make you fall to the miserable realms. Foolishpersons who entered a wrong path can lead those who strive at ennobling acts tothe hells for a thousand eons. Why is this? This is due to their engagement inmaterialist and identity-focused instruction, and the teaching of misleadingdoctrines. Thus I declare, “Compared to killing all sentient beings, teachingmisleading doctrines is a graver negative act.”The Harm in Befriending Those Whose Five Poisonous Mental Afflictions AreIntense [E]Befriending the unintelligent clouds sublime insight gained from hearing andreflection.Befriending the hateful subverts your character.Befriending the lustful fuels craving for the objects of desire.Befriending the proud increases partiality and dualistic attachment.Befriending those who are exceedingly jealous fosters the torment ofcompetitiveness.When you befriend companions or spiritual masters who are mainly unintelligent,this clouds the sublime insight you have gained from hearing the doctrine andreflecting upon it. When you befriend those who are dominated by hate, youbecome contaminated by their mistaken short temper, malice, and inner turmoil.When you befriend those who are dominated by lust, you become contaminated bytheir craving for the objects of desire. When you befriend those who search forfood and drink, you become contaminated by their mistaken striving for food anddrink. When you befriend those whose craving for wealth prevents generosity, youbecome contaminated by their debilitating greed. When you befriend those carriedaway by the winds of distraction, you become contaminated by their attachment tosexual desire and fashion. When you befriend the proud, you become contaminatedby their partiality and dualistic attachment. When you befriend those dominatedby jealousy, you become contaminated by their competitiveness and aggression.When you befriend those dominated by greed, you become contaminated by theirgrasping attachment to their piles of manure. The Pinnacle of Jewels Discoursestates:Who is a misleading companion? It is anyone who impairs ennobling acts and wholeads you to corrupting acts. Don’t rely upon such persons. Don’t honor them.Don’t even look at them.Further in the same text:Those of the hearers’ way work hard for their own goodAnd reject helping others in order to help themselves.Those who rely upon them collect objects;It is never for the doctrine that they gather.Therefore, as the Buddha said, reject negative spiritual guides and negativecompanions,And keep them at a distance.The Harm in Befriending Those Who Feel No Disengagement from the Round ofRebirth [F]Befriending those attached to this life, those without disengagement ordisillusionment at the state of existence,Those who socialize, those who seek amusement and follow fashions,Those who wield power or crave wealth, profiteers,Butchers, those who act evilly, those who act deceptively, or those who commitboth good and evil actsContaminates you with the reprehensible behavior of each.When you befriend common families, you become contaminated by their lifestyle offarming (or other work) and hoarding. When you befriend important governmentofficials, you become contaminated by their discussions and negative motivation.When you befriend the young who enjoy entertainment, you become contaminated bytheir singing, dancing, and vulgar activity. When you befriend those who seekprofit and wealth, you become contaminated by their search for food and riches.When you befriend powerful rulers, you become contaminated by their pride andpower. When you befriend those who steal and fight, you become contaminated bytheir anger, beating, and killing. When you befriend those who do the evil workof butchers, you become contaminated by their inurement to evil acts and theirpleasure in killing. When you befriend those who lie and deceive, you becomecontaminated by their fault of spreading false and deceptive stories. TheCollection of Sayings states:The wise do not associateWith those who lack faith, who are envious,Who lie or slander.They do not befriend persons who act negatively.They do not rely upon them.Those who do become contaminated by their faults,Like an arrow once dipped in poisonTaints even those arrows in the same sheath not dipped in poison.Why You Must Forsake Misleading Companions and the Benefits of Doing So [G]Befriending misleading companions undermines lasting happinessAnd leads to extreme suffering in the round of rebirth’s miserable existences:Examine your companions as you would a refuge, a guide, or an article you buy.Forsaking misleading companions increases ennobling acts,You do not regress, and you will fully accomplish mindfulness,Meditative states, vast sublime insight, and an array of qualities.This life and the next will be happy; you will proceed from happiness tohappiness.Befriending misleading companions impedes the karmic causes that produce rebirthin the higher realms, freedom, and the state of omniscience. Such persons leadyou to the unbearable sufferings of the round of rebirth and the miserableexistences. Therefore, fear misleading companions like wild animals fearhunters, like mice fear hawks, like you would fear an executioner, or like youwould fear a wild elephant.Examine negative companions as you would a temporary refuge or a guide along adangerous path, or as you would an article you buy, such as gold, silver, orgems. The advantages of examining and forsaking negative companions are thatyour cultivation of ennobling acts increases, you do not regress into mistakenpaths, and you accomplish mindfulness, meditative states, vast sublime insight,and an array of exceedingly numerous qualities. This life and the next will behappy: you will proceed from happiness to happiness until you reach the state ofsupreme great exaltation. The Pristine Moon Discourse states:In the future many fully ordained persons with manifest pride will falsify theBuddhist doctrine. At that time, they will blend their own polluted instructionswith the pure ones and claim them to be sacred. They will not honor otherBuddhist teachers; they will not ask questions of other instructors; they willslander them with a totally hateful mind. After death, these foolish personswill fall back into the miserable existences’ lower states and take rebirththere due to these causes.Do not forsake misleading companions with ill will; you must abandon them withcompassion. The Cloud of Jewels Discourse states:Misleading companions must be totally forsaken. Forsake such persons as thosewhose ethical conduct has deteriorated, whose religious rites have deteriorated,who enjoy busyness, who are lazy, who enjoy the round of rebirth, who turn theirback on awakening, or who live a layperson’s life. When forsaking them, do notbe hateful, angry, or contemptuous, but, in general, maintain the firm intentionto avoid relying upon them at any time.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSThe supreme way’s texts, the essential doctrine,Contain the supreme essential meaning, upon which you must deeply reflect.Then, with essential effort, rely upon a sublime, holy personAnd apply yourself to the essential intent—eternal cultivation of spirituallife.Heartfelt single-minded spiritual practice of the sacred Buddhist doctrineRequires compassion that aids beings in any way suitable to them,No thought in your heart besides the good of the doctrine,And a firm will from the bottom of your heart and the depth of your bones.Forsake like poison companions who act negatively in mundane ways.Rely upon noble companions who act according to the Buddhist doctrine as if itwas medicine.Gather the necessary articles and favorable conditions for the practice of theteachings.Strive ceaselessly at the ten forms of spiritual conduct.7[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st7]This concludes the commentary to “Discipleship,” Book 1 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all ways ofspiritual development.

How Buddhism Is Taught2. How to Listen to Buddhist Teaching3. An Exposition of Faith, the Foundation of the Sacred Buddhist DoctrineThese three chapters contain a total of twenty-six headings.HOW BUDDHISM IS TAUGHT [I] [05_toc-title.html#sec-5]This chapter has nine parts: (1) Buddhism’s teaching methods in general, (2)specific teaching methods, (3) a definitive presentation of the doctrine, (4)the general categories of canonical texts and treatises translated into Tibetan,(5) how to teach, (6) what the teacher meditates upon when teaching, (7)teaching adapted to the disciples’ degree of acumen, (8) how teaching completesthe stores of goodness and wisdom, and (9) the dedication of goodness and anexplanation of teaching’s benefits.Buddhism’s Teaching Methods in General [A]Spiritual masters present the sacred doctrine as follows: Buddhas employ threemiracles—Magical emanation, insightful exposition, and instruction.Arhats employed purity in three domains—The pure teacher, auditor, and subjects.Among scholars, those of Nalanda Monastic CollegeTaught the canon according to five magnificent aspects of a teachingAnd the treatises according to five initial considerations.Scholars of Vikramashila Monastic CollegePrepared the worthy recipient, and described the author of the text,The spiritual teaching, how to teach, and how to listen.Buddhas turn the wheel of the doctrine based on three miracles. (1) The Buddhadisplayed immeasurable physical miracles, such as emitting light or levitationin space to a height of seven palm trees. These miracles of magical emanationinspired his disciples’ faith and positive intentions. (2) Then, for the miracleof insightful exposition, the Buddha’s clairvoyance viewed every disciple’sspiritual affinity, attitude, and latent tendency. With the intention to teachin relation to each, he blessed his circle of followers’ streams of being, andthereby performed the miracle of wisdom mind that purified and prepared theirdispositions. (3) The Buddha then produced the miracle of instruction, a rain ofteachings in relation to his disciples’ interests. Such teachings brought beingsto states of spiritual uplift and certain excellence.Arhats expressed the doctrine based upon the presence of purity in threedomains: the auditor, a pure vessel; the teacher’s pure speech; and the purityof the subjects of the Buddha’s excellent speech. To ensure the vessel’s purity,arhats examined with clairvoyance whether or not the auditor was a worthy vesselfor the doctrine and accepted worthy recipients as disciples. They then usedpure speech—pleasant-sounding, flawless words and terms—in verbal articulation.They related without error or confusion the purity of the subjects, thedoctrine’s meaning (such as different terminologies to guide the listener toliberation), which thus became meaningful.Why did arhats not rely upon the three miracles in their teaching, in imitationof the Buddha? Arhats of the hearers’ way could not teach in this fashion sincetheir clairvoyance has four limitations. They do not know distant places, eonsof time, limitless causes and consequences, and the extremely varied aspects ofbuddhas’ qualities.Scholars presented the doctrine in two ways. First, scholars resident at theillustrious Nalanda Monastic College presented the canon in relation to ateaching’s five magnificent aspects, and the treatises according to a teaching’sfive initial considerations. A teaching’s five magnificent aspects are thecommon or extraordinary setting, the teacher, the doctrine, the circle ofauditors, and the time of the teaching.The five initial considerations identify the author who wrote the text, thescriptural sources from which the text was compiled, the category of thedoctrine to which it belongs, for whose benefit it is given, and a briefsynopsis of the teaching, from beginning to end.This treatise can be described according to these criteria: (1) The author isLongchen Choying Tobden Dorje Mapam Choklé Nampar Gyalwa, a noble person who hasgained confidence from having heard the Joyful Buddha’s excellent speech, andreflected and meditated upon it. (2) This text is compiled from scripturalsources in both the cause-based way of characteristics and the result-basedsecret mantra way. (3) This treatise belongs to natural great perfectioninstructions, specifically great perfection’s branch that provides an entrancefor persons on the eight levels of spiritual practice based on the rationaldualistic mind to the ninth, final stage, atiyoga. (4) This treatise is writtento provide an escort to accompany fortunate persons of present and futuregenerations, both those individuals who develop gradually and those who reachimmediate realization. (5) To provide a brief synopsis of the text frombeginning to end, the root text and commentaries to The Invaluable Treasury ofBuddhist Discourses and Tantras can be summarized as texts that reveal thebasis, path, and result of Buddhist practice; or the view, meditation, andconduct. These subjects can be synthesized in three stages—how to enter thepath, the actual path, and its ultimate result. They are elucidated in thiswork’s 25 books, 101 chapters, and 2,179 headings.Second, scholars resident at Vikramashila Monastic College used a two-partmethod to teach the doctrine. They first made the listener a worthy vessel, thengave a definitive outline of the teaching. The first of these has three aspects:they described the outstanding qualities of the master, author of the text, theoutstanding qualities of the spiritual teaching he or she wrote, and how toteach and listen to the doctrine imbued with such qualities.This treatise can be described according to those criteria: (1) The master whowrote this text, I, Longchen Choying Tobden Dorje, have assumed theresponsibility to increase the welfare and happiness of Buddhism and beings bymeans of hearing the doctrine, and reflection and meditation upon it; and itsteaching, debate, and composition.(2) The teaching I write gathers into one work the profound and vast essentialmeaning of the discourses’ and tantras’ range of ways of spiritual development.This work’s fortunate readers will find it easy to understand. This work’s maincourse concerning causes and effects is unmistaken. It leads persons of varyingdegrees of acumen to higher levels. It does not depend upon extraneous secondaryaspects of the path. Hearing it dispels the darkness of ignorance. Reflection onit brings understanding of inspiration in the abiding nature. Meditation on itbrings liberation in the expanse of the nature of reality. Teaching it increasesyour own and others’ sublime insight. Hearing it causes the lotus of yourintellect to blossom. Reading it exhausts your mental afflictions’ wrongdoingand obscurations. To examine it leads to finding the path of freedom’sawakening. Thus, this work embodies a vast collection of an infinite number ofhelpful qualities, temporary or lasting, in every moment and circumstance. Thus,this treatise, a root text and commentaries to it, constitutes a well-adornedgreat brimming lake, entitled The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra toTantra.(3) How to teach and to listen to the teaching and an outline of the doctrineare presented in detail below.Specific Teaching Methods [B]This section has two parts: (1) how the discourses are taught and (2) how thetantras are taught.How the Discourses Are Taught [1]The five elements of teaching methodsAre the purpose, the summary, the literal meanings, the connections, andrefutations of challenges.The purpose has four aspects: the subject,The purpose, the innermost purpose, and the progression.The five elements of teaching methods are as follows: the purpose, the summary,the literal meanings, the connections, and refutation of challenges.First, the purpose of a specific teaching has four aspects, described here inrelation to this text: the subject—any essential intent of the canon, treatises,and pith instructions; the purpose—to facilitate easy and thorough understandingof the main text and of subsequent correct experiential cultivation forfortunate individuals of present and future generations; the innermostpurpose—that disciples employ cultivation of goodness and wisdom to reach thefar bounds of renunciation and realization, to attain supreme awakening’slasting happiness, and to then lead every being without exception to that samestate; and the progression—these three aspects are related, the latter to theformer.Second, the summary is elucidated in the text The Wish-Fulfilling Vine (theoutline), which lists this treatise’s books, chapters, and headings. Third,literal meanings are clarified by concise and extensive commentaries to themeaning of each word and verse—one, two, three, or four lines—in the root text.Fourth, connections are provided by words that introduce and conclude the books,such as “The round of rebirth as suffering has been presented above; I will nowdescribe refuge.”Fifth, refutation of challenges—as an example, it could be said, “Your so-calledtreatise entitled The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra isunnecessary, since within it, all the meanings of the words contained in thediscourses and tantras are incomplete.” That challenge can be refuted by thisstatement: “Although the discourses’ and tantras’ words are incomplete in thistext, I have written in the treatise The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutrato Tantra a new and original presentation that fully spans every indispensablevast and deep word and subject found in the discourses and tantras, and havethereby furthered the doctrine’s activity.”How the Tantras Are Taught [2]This section has two parts: (1) how secret mantra in general is taught and (2)how great perfection is taught.How Secret Mantra in General Is Taught [a]Explanation of the tantras includes six topics—the general meaning, concealedmeaning,Final meaning, auxiliary meaning, meaning of the words, and pith instructions;The six parameters—definitive meaning, provisional meaning, implied meaning,unimplied meaning,Literal meaning, and not literal meaning;And four methods of interpretation—by the words’ meaning, general meaning,concealed meaning, or final meaning.Many systems of explanation are specific to individual tantras.The four streams comprise the expository scriptures, blessing-empowerments,Aural lineage instructions, and rituals for accomplishing enlightened activity.Other styles of commentary include providing the structure of the meaning,An outline of the main text, a word-by-word commentary,And a summary into pith instructions; or a presentation, explanation, andsummary.Although there exist inconceivable numbers of profound instructions that presentmethods to teach the precious tantras, I present here six profound instructionssince they facilitate a teacher’s commentary and can be easily understood bylisteners. Three are pith instructions concerning the teaching of a tantra’ssubject: teaching of the general meaning, teaching of the concealed meaning, andteaching of the final meaning. Three concern teaching based on a tantra’scontent: teaching based on grammar, the auxiliary meaning; teaching of themeaning of the words; and teaching of the pith instructions’ meaning. TheGlorious Tantra Equal to the Sky states:These provide the only reliable explanations of tantras:Presentation of the words’ meanings, auxiliary meaning,Concise meaning, general meaning,Concealed meaning, and final meaning.First, what is called “general meaning” is common to both discourses and secretmantra. It includes subjects explained in the general discourses of the way ofthe transcendent perfections, such as awakening’s thirty-seven facets, fivepaths, and ten stages. Such subjects included in the category of general meaningare taught to reassure those who entered the path of transcendent perfectionsand who might otherwise feel regret that tantra is inconsistent with their path.These topics are also taught because they are mentioned as subjects withinsecret mantra’s scriptures. Thus, they are called “general meaning.” Further,they are called “general” because the phase of creation is generally related to,and is an auxiliary of, the vase empowerment; persons who have received thisempowerment and engage in spiritual practice to gain sublime accomplishment andthose who do so to gain common powers both learn this meaning. The Compendium ofVajra Wisdom states:The general meaning is teaching given to not antagonize those who might disdainthe wonderful vajra words they hear.Master Chandrakirti states:The general meaningIs taught to prevent remorseOf those committed to the discourses and other such paths,And for those who have undertaken the phase of creation.Second, what is called “the concealed meaning” is given this appellation becauseit is not revealed to those who have received just the vase empowerment: it isgiven exclusively to those who have received the three higher supremeempowerments beyond the vase empowerment. Further, it is called “concealed” inregard to the special techniques used for a meditation practice referred to asself-consecration and the concealed sacred circles of the body’s energy centers.The Hévajra Tantra states:Fully uplift the mind to awakeningIn relative and ultimate mannersUsing techniques of the energy centers’ sacred circlesAnd the stages of self-consecration.Third, the final meaning constitutes the manifestly accomplished result that canbe gained by an individual on any path. The general final meaning is the commonresult, the stage of awakening called Illuminating. The concealed final meaningis the unsurpassable result of secret mantra, the stage of Vajra Holder. Thismeaning teaches many special instructions not taught in the transcendentperfections’ scriptures, such as nondual knowledge that enlightenment’s bodiesand wisdoms, and all phenomena, are self-manifest; thus, the authentic finalmeaning. Although the former attainment—the stage called Illuminating—is notreally the final one, it has been designated “final” since it is close to thatstate. This use of terminology resembles that found in a passage in The Ornamentof Manifest Realization, where awakening’s tenth stage is designated “the stageof enlightenment”:For those who rest in the stage of enlightenment,The wisdom beyond the ninth stage of awakeningIs what should be knownAs a bodhisattva’s tenth stage.Fourth, the auxiliary meaning, explanation of the tantras’ content based ongrammar, is taught by examining the words and terms explicitly presented inscripture. Instruction can be given depending on circumstances, according toknown secular terms, to known literary terms, or to the presence or absence ofdefinitions that rationalize the use of such terms. When the abbreviation ofterms makes a text’s meaning difficult to comprehend, its terms can beelucidated by enlarging or contracting them, or by adding missing subjects,objects, or verbs. The meanings of a text’s terms can be determined in fourways: the lion’s gaze, the frog’s leap, the turtle’s fourlegged gait, and thetigress’s pounce.Fifth, teaching of tantras by the meaning of their words is as follows. When thesense of a passage cannot be directly grasped from the text’s sentences, themeaning might be understood when the words are taken separately. In such cases,commentary can be made based upon teaching of the words’ linguistic meaning,elucidation of the separate words, or elucidation of similar words.Sixth, teaching of tantras by means of synthesized pith instructions presentsthat which neither the auxiliary meaning nor the words can explain. Thisincludes whatever can be understood by elucidation of the concise meaning withevery symbol the transcendent buddhas used. Master Chandrakirti states:Kotraksh and other forms of grammarThat do not exist in worldly treatisesRepresent the transcendent buddhas’ symbolsWhich express nonliteral meanings.The Six Parameters and Four Methods of InterpretationThe six parameters are the following: the literal meaning, the definitivemeaning, the unimplied meaning, the nonliteral meaning, the provisional meaning,and the implied meaning.A tantra’s literal meaning is taught by presenting its content’s two generalmeanings (that is, the discourses and the phase of creation) according to theirauxiliary (that is, linguistic) meaning. A tantra’s definitive meaning is taughtby presenting its concealed meaning according to its auxiliary meaning. Atantra’s unimplied meaning is taught by presenting its final meaning accordingto the auxiliary meaning. A tantra’s nonliteral meaning is taught by presentingits two general meanings according to its words and the pith instructions. Atantra’s provisional meaning is taught by presenting its concealed meaningaccording to the same two (words and pith instructions). A tantra’s impliedmeaning is taught by presenting its final meaning according to these two. Theseare the six parameters.The four methods of interpretation are presentation of the words’ meaning,presentation of the general meaning, presentation of the concealed meaning, andpresentation of the final meaning.These teaching methods provide commentary to the tantras in the followingmanner: A scripture’s terms and meanings are sometimes taught according to thegeneral meaning, sometimes according to the concealed meaning, and sometimesaccording to the final meaning. To present the language found in a scripture,the auxiliary meaning is the principal subject, whereas the other two (concealedand final meanings) are used sparingly, according to context. These are called“teaching of the auxiliary meaning,” “teaching of the words’ meaning,”“straightforward teaching of the text,” or “the well-known teaching.”Specifically, some terms in scripture can be explained according to the generalmeaning for those who enjoy explanations consistent with the transcendentperfections or those who enjoy the phase of creation. Or, the same terms canalso be explained according to fierce inner heat and sacred circles of thebody’s energy centers for those interested in the profound, who enjoy meditationtechniques focused upon their own bodies, or those who enjoy the contemplativepractice of the seal of passion focused upon another’s body. Texts can be taughtaccording to the final meaning to provide a general intellectual picture oftantra for those who have realization, or to instill understanding by means ofanalogies of wisdom for those who have realization. These teaching techniquesare called “explaining the tantras’ meaning, which is like a wish-fulfillingjewel.”Commentaries to the TantrasTexts that teach the tantras in this manner among the class of nondual tantrasinclude the commentary to the Wheel of Time tantra, Stainless Light.Among tantras of sublime insight, such texts include The Higher Commentary tothe Root Tantra of Supreme Bliss by Bodhisattva Vajra Holder; A Collection ofJewels, a commentary to difficult points; The Attractive Warrior; and TheCommentary to “The Ocean of Dakas Tantra.” Further, this category includes TheRoot Tantra of Vajra Creator of Delight and commentaries to it including onewritten by Bodhisattva Vajra Holder; a commentary to difficult points, LotusPossessing; Kaumuti; a commentary to difficult points, Vajra Tent; and Harvestof Pith Instructions, a commentary to Samputa Tantra.Among tantras of skillful means, in the exalted master Nagarjuna’s cycle ofMatrix of Mystery, texts include a commentary to the tantra, Clear Lamp; andcommentaries to the six branches of application and others. In VenerableBuddhajnana’s cycle there exists a commentary to the tantra entitled Help toDisciples. In all these tantras, general explanatory texts include texts ofpractical guidance in meditation and rituals of the deities’ sacred circles,with auxiliary practices.Among the cycles of the lower tantras, for yoga tantra, texts include theextensive explanation of The Quintessence of the Ultimate; for activity tantra,the commentary to The Tantra of Buddha Illuminator’s Manifest Awakening; and foraction tantra, the commentary to The Latter Tantra of Meditative Stability. Eachlevel of tantra has specific and general commentaries, along with texts ofpractical guidance in meditation, rituals of the deities’ sacred circles, andauxiliary practices.The Original Translations’ Four Streams of TransmissionThe original translations’ four streams of transmission are the stream of theexpository scriptures, which elucidates every Buddhist way’s terms and meanings;the stream of blessing-empowerments, which transforms delusion’s appearancesinto the infinite expanse of the perception of purity; the stream of aurallineage instructions, which adds spiritual experience to the scriptures’meanings, so that meditation on them produces accomplishment of the rainbow bodyin a single lifetime; and the stream of the practical application of enlightenedactivity, which gives mastery of an ocean of infinite enlightened activity toaccomplish two purposes, the ultimate goal for others and yourself.Additional Styles of Teaching the TantrasFour other styles of teaching these tantras are presentations of the following:the tantra’s structure, an outline of the main text, a word-by-word commentary,and a synthesis of the pith instructions. Among these, teaching that begins asif from the tip of an arrow describes the structure by means of the title’smeaning. Teaching that begins as if from the middle of a conch presents the maintext’s outline by means of the teaching’s five magnificent aspects that createthe teaching’s initial setting. Teaching that begins as if from a sword’s handleprovides a word-by-word commentary to the main text and finishes with asynthesis of the pith instructions.Another system is presented in A Garland of Flowers: Pith Instructions forTeaching. It describes teaching in three formats: delineation of therelationship between the text’s subjects, “the frog’s leap”; explanation of themeaning of the terms’ syllables, “the turtle’s gait”; and summary of a chapter’ssubjects, “the elephant’s swagger.”Further, the threefold “presentation, explanation, and summary” refers to abrief presentation, an extensive explanation, and a summary of the chapters, andprovides a format for a thorough explanation.Moreover, the doctrine to be transmitted must have been taught by the Buddha,collected by the compilers, elucidated by learned and accomplished masters,taught by scholars, translated by lo-tsa-wa (translators), be imbued with thecontinuity of the spiritual masters’ lineages of pith instructions andscriptural transmissions, and known to the wise. Therefore, such teachings musthave three characteristics: their scriptures are consistent with the discourses,tantras, and treatises; their reasoning is consistent with obvious grammaticalmeaning; and their instructions do not contradict the profound nature ofreality.How Great Perfection Is Taught [b]Great perfection tantras are taught by describing six subjects:Their essence, definitions, divisions, scope, examples, and proof.The seventeen tantras are Unimpeded Sound, Self-Manifest Awareness,Self-Liberated Awareness, Self-Arisen Perfection,The Lion’s Full Strength, Auspicious Beauty, Exquisite Design of Gems,The Pearl Garland, Wordless,Mirror of Vajrasattva’s Heart, Mirror of Ever Excellent’s Wisdom Mind, Union ofSun and Moon,Elaborate Introduction, Blaze of the Holy Form,Heap of Jewels, Blazing Lamps, and Six Expanses.These tantras are classified as three essences, three nectars, and threeflowers.Tantras encompass, plumb the depth, or turn back the assault on wisdom.There are two auxiliary tantras, a tantra of the contemplative practice ofliberation,A heart-like tantra, the secret text we follow, and a weapon-like tantra.They are useful. They can be taught as tantras, transmissions, or pithinstructions;Or according to the collection of twenty-three precious examplesAnd the wish-fulfilling tree of the five principles.Great perfection tantras are taught by describing six subjects: essence,definitions, divisions, scope, examples, and proof. First, great perfectiontantra’s essence is the subject of awareness and how it is determined, sublimesecrets which cannot be altered by additions or deletions. Second, greatperfection tantra’s definition is twofold: It is “tantra” (literally,“continuum”) since it indicates the enlightened heritage—what it is and whatcauses that enlightened heritage to arise. It is “tantra” since it isunalterable, uninterrupted, and continually arising.Third, if classified, great perfection tantra is twofold: natural, ultimatetantra and symbolic, verbal tantra. Ultimate tantra is the natural luminosity ofmind itself, free from the impurities of discursive thought. Since this existspermanently within all beings, it is tantra; since it is indwellingenlightenment, it is tantra; and since it has enlightenment’s characteristics,it is established as tantra.To represent this ultimate tantra itself, verbal tantras contain subjects,terms, and words, which have the nature of letters, divided into chapters, andso on. Tantras that principally present the phase of creation are tantras ofskillful means; those that principally present the phase of completion, sublimeinsight tantras; the two in equal measure, nondual, integral union tantras;tantras that teach that which transcends everything reveal great perfection’skey points.Fourth, the scope of tantras mainly focused on the phase of creation is spannedby ten subjects here listed in five pairs: the initial, fundamental empowermentand tantric bonds; wisdom deities and mantras; sacred circles and offerings;meditative states and conduct; enlightened activity and the view. When these tenare complete, the tantra has mainly focused on the phase of creation. The scopeof tantras mainly focused on the phase of completion is spanned by eightsubjects here listed in four pairs: the view and result; conduct and meditation;mind and wisdom; meditative experience and profound instruction. When theseeight are complete, the tantra has mainly focused on the phase of completion.Tantras of nondual integral union have eighteen subjects, since they mustinclude both these lists’ topics.Of the phases of creation and completion, complete great perfection concerns thephase of completion. This phase has two categories: the lesser phase ofcompletion, which presents the elaborate stages of subtle channels, circulatingenergy, and vital essences; and the supreme phase of completion, which presentsthe stages of the wisdom of luminosity. The supreme phase of completion’s entirescope is spanned by five subjects: two on the entrance—empowerments and vows;two on the path and conclusive certainty; and one on the result.Fifth, the example that illustrates tantra is a cord. A cord is produced frommany threads of cloth; likewise, in tantra, we acquire a single meaning basedupon many separate terms.Sixth, the proof of tantra is that it reveals the continuity of enlightenment,buddha nature, present within ourselves. Moreover, since the ultimate state isunmistakably determined and realized based on the verbal tantras’ key points,they are established as tantra.Great Perfection’s Eighteen TantrasAn extensive explanation of the verbal great perfection tantras includesanalysis of the following eighteen tantras: 1. The Great Self-Manifest Awareness Tantra. This tantra presents content that is deep and vast, like the ocean. 2. The Mirror of Vajrasattva’s Heart Tantra. This tantra illuminates, like the sun. 3. The Lion’s Full Strength. This tantra overwhelms the lower Buddhist ways with its brilliance. 4. The Glorious Wordless Tantra.

This mirrorlike tantra relates metaphors to meanings, like reflections appearing in a mirror. 12. The Pearl Garland. This tantra presents the ordered series of pith instructions, like an excellent series of pearls in a necklace. 13. Self-Liberated Awareness. This tantra presents how the scripture’s words unravel themselves naturally, like a snake’s knots. 14. The Mirror of Ever Excellent’s Wisdom Mind. This tantra is like a great garuda that soars in space without effort or endeavor. 15. Self-Arisen Perfection. This river-like tantra presents empowerments and blessings like a river’s flow. 16. The Blaze of the Holy Form. This tantra is like the enduring royal line that rules the capital. 17. The Heap of Jewels. This tantra is like a wealthy person’s treasure vault that provides anything one wishes. 18. Black Wrathful Goddess. The eighteenth, a razor-like tantra, entirely destroys contradictory influences like a tempered razor that slices through whatever it touches.Classified according to their purpose, these eighteen tantras form elevengroups: first, the three essential tantras are as listed above, [1]Self-Manifest Awareness, [13] Self-Liberated Awareness, and [4] Wordless.Knowledge of these three brings mastery of tantra’s general meanings, like theauthority a ruler has over commoners. Further, Wordless presents tantra’sgeneral pith instructions, like the authority of a government official.Self-Manifest Awareness identifies the basis of the view, meditation, andconduct, like the service, tribute, and so on given by common people.Self-Liberated Awareness divulges the meaning of the transcendent nature.Collecting these three brings mastery of all tantras, like authority wieldedover an entire kingdom.Second, the tantras’ three nectars are [14] The Mirror of Ever Excellent’sWisdom Mind, [2] The Mirror of Vajrasattva’s Heart, and [9] The Exquisite Designof Gems. Knowledge of these three brings understanding of the meaning of alltantras’ inner contents, a purpose like reaching three mountains’ summits fromwhich the valleys below are visible.Third, the tantras’ three flowers are [12] The Pearl Garland, [5] AuspiciousBeauty, and [3] The Lion’s Full Strength. Knowledge of these three bringsunderstanding without any lack of clarity in tantra’s words and meanings, apurpose like three suns rising in the sky that rid the world of darkness.Fourth, [15] Self-Arisen Perfection encompasses all tantras. Its purpose is tobring knowledge of how empowerments establish freedom’s foundation, like apalace’s solidly built foundation upon which many stories can be built.Fifth, [11] Elaborate Introduction illuminates all tantras and plumbs theirdepths. This tantra’s purpose is to bring fearlessness toward the round ofrebirth’s abodes, like having completed the construction of a palace’s keep,where armies cannot trespass.Sixth, [10] The Union of Sun and Moon turns back attacks on wisdom. Its purposeis to undo delusion in the period between lifetimes.Seventh, [17] The Heap of Jewels and [16] The Blaze of the Holy Form are twoauxiliary tantras. Like a palace roof, realization that wisdom is self-manifestis exquisitely beautiful.Eighth, [8] Blazing Lamps is the tantra of the contemplative practice ofliberation. Knowledge of this tantra brings accomplishment of goals, a purposelike a ruler who resides in the pinnacle of the palace and can accomplish manywishes.Ninth, [7] The Six Expanses is the heart-like tantra. Realization of the viewprevents mistaken paths, obscurations, and obstacles, a purpose like havinglocked the palace gates to prevent destruction by thieves and enemies.Tenth, [6] Unimpeded Sound is the main scripture of mystery. It eliminates allhesitation, like an outer encircling iron fence.Eleventh, [18] Black Wrathful Goddess is the weapon-like tantra. It entirelydestroys contradictory influences and prevents all obstacles, like excellentgatekeepers who prevent harm from intruding.These tantras’ benefits are as follows. When you memorize these texts, you areintroduced directly to awareness itself; when you preserve them, you restdirectly in meditative states; when you read them, their contents’ meaning dawnsin your mind; when you teach them, you attain common feats and supremeaccomplishment; when you meditate on them, the round of rebirth empties from itsdepths; when you listen to them, you enjoy temporal wisdom.Presentation of the TantrasHow are these tantras presented? For those who delight in elaborate details, allthese tantras are presented. For those of a middle degree of acumen, thesetantras are condensed into eight categories, complete in eight tantras. Forthose of a high degree of acumen, it is sufficient to condense the tantras’meaning into five categories—two derived from skillful means and three derivedfrom their nature. For those of the very highest degree of acumen, tantras ofmeaning and words are presented. For those of an extremely high level, who arefree from any embellishments, the tantra of the ground of being is accomplishedby awareness alone, since all tantras are complete within awareness.Alternatively, for those who delight in details, all the tantras of the basis(mahayoga), the heart essence (anuyoga), and the cycle of the vital essence(atiyoga) are taught. The seventeen tantras are taught to disciples of a middledegree of acumen. Only the seed tantra Self-Arisen Perfection is taught forthose of the highest degree of acumen. For those at the peak, it is said thatthe three testaments of the awareness holders bring liberation.8[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st8]How These Tantras Are TaughtOn the subject of auxiliary means to teach tantra, Self-Liberated Awarenessstates:In the tradition of explanation in the king’s (the Buddha’s) doctrine,Teach according to circumstance in these three ways:Teach according to scriptures; teach according to tantras;And teach according to pith instructions.Know these from the tantra’s opening remarks.In this quote, teaching “according to scriptures” refers to presenting the fivemagnificent aspects of the tantra’s first teaching; teaching “according to thetantras” refers to teaching three definite subjects; teaching “according to thepith instructions” refers to teaching according to the basis, path, and result.When teaching according to the tantras for those of acute discernment whounderstand by hearing the title alone, express the meaning of the tantra’stitle. For those at a middle level, who understand merely by the table ofcontents, present the preamble according to the tantra’s five magnificentaspects. For those of dull acumen, who understand through metaphors andmeanings, teach the main body of the text in detail.A precise, extensive list of teaching styles presents twenty-eightguidelines—the collection of twenty-three precious examples and thewish-fulfilling tree of the five principles. Self-Liberated Awareness states:Those whose sublime insight is like a leaping tigressTeach making distinctions in the great terrain of tantra’s meaning.Those whose intellect is like a soaring garudaTeach setting out the tantra’s entire structure.Those whose intellect is like a lion’s roarTeach overpowering the lower Buddhist ways with their brilliance.Those whose intellect is like a turtle’s crawlTeach explaining the words’ syllables.Those whose intellect is like a raven’s scoutingTeach eradicating obscurations due to errors.Those whose intellect is like an athlete’s stanceTeach synthesizing the extensive meaning.Those whose intellect is like a prone elephantTeach bringing the view into focus.Those whose intellect is like a bird collecting foodTeach having searched for the subjects’ intent.Those whose intellect is like an eagle huntingTeach without doubts toward the meaning.Those whose intellect is like a fawn climbing a cliffTeach explaining that which is appropriate and that which is not.Those whose intellect is like a string of pearlsTeach putting in order the pith instructions’ meanings.Those whose intellect is like timely rain with thunderTeach rebutting non-Buddhists’ criticisms.Those whose intellect is like blowing a trumpetTeach comparing all approaches to tantra.Those whose intellect is like a wish-fulfilling treeTeach with very extensive details.Those whose intellect is like the sun in a clear skyTeach completely encompassing all subjects.Those whose intellect is deep and clear like the moonTeach with transcendence of the round of rebirth’s sorrow.Those whose intellect is like a lion’s bearingTeach according to the meaning of meditation.Those whose intellect is like swans always accompanying one anotherTeach having collated the tantra’s contents with its outline.Those whose intellect is like a rainbow in the skyTeach the basic space of phenomena with its ornaments.Those whose intellect cuts like a razor’s edgeTeach distinguishing the views.Those whose intellect is like the circle of a mirrorTeach including causes and conditions.Those whose intellect is like lightning in the skyTeach quickly with meanings for each word.Those whose intellect is like empty spaceTeach with unlimited vastness.Those whose intellect is like a deeply planted rootTeach presenting the essence of awareness.Those whose intellect is like a coiled tree trunkTeach a summation of the teachings’ meaning.Those whose intellect is like spreading branchesTeach adding the meanings of profound instructions.Those whose intellect is like flourishing leavesTeach according to the twenty-one tantras.Those whose intellect is vivid like flowersTeach according to the two lamps.Those whose intellect is like ripened fruitTeach without having the result devolve to a cause.These and other teaching methodsShould be learned in stages.A Definitive Presentation of the Doctrine [C]The magnificent setting, teacher, doctrine, entourage, and time periodcharacterizeThe turning of the three cycles—on the four truths, on the absence ofcharacteristics, and on definitive meaning.Each of the four collections—on the monastic code,The discourses, on observed phenomena, and the supreme collection on observedphenomena—Contains twenty-one thousand teachings spoken by the Buddha, the extent of thecanon.The doctrine’s eighty-four thousand aggregations were compiled on threeoccasions.The seven patriarchs, the six ornaments, the two supreme teachers, and otherscomposed the treatises.There are six styles of commentaryAnd three methods of teaching.Our Teacher initially uplifted his wisdom mind to sublime awakening,subsequently cultivated stores of goodness and wisdom during three incalculableeons, and finally attained perfect enlightenment at Vajra Seat. Thus, with theseand other acts, he performed a buddha’s twelve deeds.Among these deeds, he taught the first cycle of Buddhist teaching in themagnificent setting—Falling Seers, Gift of Fearlessness Deer Park—near Varanasi,India. The magnificent teacher was Shakyamuni (Sage of the Shakyas). He taughtthe magnificent doctrine, the four truths, to the magnificent entourage of thefive excellent individuals and eighty thousand gods for the magnificent periodof seven years after his attainment of enlightenment.The middle cycle of Buddhist teaching was taught in the magnificent setting ofVulture Peak at Rajgir. The magnificent teacher, Shakyamuni, taught themagnificent doctrine, three versions of the canon of the perfection of sublimeinsight—extensive, middle-length, and abridged—organized into six sets. Themagnificent entourage comprised two groups of disciples. The first was a commonentourage of five thousand fully ordained monks, including Shariputra,Maudgalyayana, and Subhuti; five hundred fully ordained nuns, includingPrajapati Gautami; and many ordained laymen and laywomen, including thehouseholder Anatapindada. Second, the extraordinary entourage numbered billionsof persons, including the bodhisattvas Bhadrapala, Ratnasambhava, and the holyleader. Shakyamuni taught for the magnificent period of thirty years.The magnificent teacher Shakyamuni taught the doctrine’s final cycle inmagnificent settings, such as the abodes of gods and nagas, and the city ofRajgir, and the town Lotus-Possessing. He taught the magnificent doctrine, suchas the enumeration of definitive meaning, buddha nature, to a particularly largeentourage of common and extraordinary groups of disciples for the magnificentperiod of ten years.Thus, the Buddha turned the wheel of the doctrine’s three cycles, comprisingfour collections—on the monastic code, of discourses, on observed phenomena, andon supreme observed phenomena. Each collection contains twenty-one thousandteachings, a total of the doctrine’s eighty-four thousand aggregations, theextent of the canon.The Canon’s Three CompilationsSubsequently, the canon underwent three compilations. The first occurred duringthe summer following the Buddha’s transcendence of sorrow (that is, his passingaway). In the secret cave of Asurava at Rajgir, King Ajatasatru providedsustenance to an assembly of five hundred arhats. The Minor Scripture on theMonastic Code of Conduct states:Five classes of teachings—discourses, aphorisms in prose and verse,Prophetic declarations, verses, and meaningful expressions—Were placed in the collection of discourses.Four classes of teachings—narratives, legends,What are called fables, and tales of past lives—Were placed in the collection on the monastic code.Three classes of teachings—extensive teachings, marvelous events, andestablished instructions—Were placed in the collection on observed phenomena.Moreover, it is said that Ananda compiled the discourses; Upali, the monasticcode; and Mahakashyapa, the collection on observed phenomena.The second compilation occurred eighty years after the Buddha’s transcendence ofsorrow. In Vaishali, seven hundred arhats gathered; the arhat Upagupta compiledthe three collections. The Buddhist king Ashoka served as patron.The third compilation occurred over three hundred years and close to fourhundred years after the Buddha’s transcendence of sorrow. Five hundredbodhisattvas who had attained perfect memory, five hundred arhats, and sixteenthousand fully ordained monks gathered at Jalandhara in Kashmir, and were servedby the patron, King Kanika. Bodhisattva Sumitra and Arhat Purnika compiled thedoctrine.The line of the doctrine’s seven patriarchs began with the elder Mahakashyapa,to whom the Buddha entrusted his doctrine at the time of his transcendence ofsorrow. Mahakashyapa entrusted it to Ananda, who entrusted it to Shanavashin,who entrusted it to Upagupta, who entrusted it to Dhitika, who entrusted it toKrishna, who entrusted it to Sudarshana.Composition of the TreatisesFinally, what were the acts of those who composed the treatises? During theBuddha’s lifetime, seven arhats composed seven texts on observed phenomena. Atthe time of the second compilation, five hundred arhats, including Upagupta,composed The Great Treasury of Detailed Explanations.Four hundred years after the Buddha’s passing away, Master Nagarjuna wrote suchtexts as The Collection of Sayings, commentaries to the first cycle of thedoctrine; The Collection on Reasoning, commentaries to the middle cycle; and TheCollection of Praises, commentaries to the final cycle. Aryadeva composed TheFour Hundred Verses and Chandrakirti composed such texts as Entering the MiddleWay and Clear Words.Close to one thousand years after the Buddha’s passing away, the exaltedBodhisattva Maitreya composed five treatises—two “ornaments,” two“distinctions,” and The Highest Continuity, all of which he gave to Asanga.Asanga composed such works as five treatises on the stages of awakening and thetwo compendiums. Vasubandhu composed the root text and commentary to TheTreasury of Observed Phenomena. Dignaga composed such texts as A Summary of theMeaning of “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Stanzas” and ACompilation on Logic. Dharmakirti composed seven texts on valid cognition,including A Complete Commentary on Logic. Chandragomi composed a treatise onSanskrit grammar, Chandra’s Grammar, and other works. Acharya Vira composed ThePast Lives of the Buddha. Shantideva composed Entering the Conduct ofBodhisattvas. Vimalamitra composed Generating Joy, An Elephant Drinking Water,and other works that present the subject of the four scriptures on the monasticcode.

Prepare a parasol, banners, a canopy, and copiouscollections of offerings. Make attractive arrangements of various forms of musicand offerings, such as the offering of the universe in the form of a mandala.After you take the teaching seat, uplift your mind to awakening, then say thefollowing words aloud:May all sentient beings attain the eyes of the teachings’ wisdom! May I lightthe lamps of their wisdom! May I place them in eternal happiness, the state ofenlightenment! In order that the teachings’ essence long endure, I will explainthe sacred Buddhist doctrine!What the Teacher Meditates upon When Teaching [F]When teaching the three collections, imagine yourself clearly as Lord of theShakyas;When teaching the outer or inner tantras, as a principal buddha ofenlightenment’s five wisdom clans;When teaching great perfection, as Buddha Ever Excellent.In each case, your adamantine tongue produces the sound of the doctrine in themelodic voice of Brahma.Think that this reaches beings who fill the bounds of space,Wakes them from the sleep of ignorance, and causes the clearly manifestqualitiesOf their innate constituent enlightenment, buddha nature, to blossom.When teaching any Buddhist way, imagine yourself clearly as that way’s Teacher.Think that your teaching’s sound pervades all worldly realms, wakes all beingsfrom the sleep of ignorance, has them attain the meaning of wisdom, and placesthem on the path to freedom. Their understanding of the words’ and meanings’subjects causes the qualities of indwelling awareness, their innate constituentenlightenment, buddha nature, to manifestly blossom.Teaching Adapted to the Disciples’ Degrees of Acumen [G]Infants and adults eat different diets;Likewise, teach beginners such subjects as death, and actions and consequences.Teach the lesser and great ways’ paths to those who have entered the Buddhistpath.Teach cosmology and the five subjects of Buddhist culture to those who work forothers’ good.Teach a general outline of the tenets of philosophical schools to groups ofscholars.Teach instruction in the tantras to special recipients.Teach the very profound essential meaning to those of supreme spiritual fortune.For all those of dull minds, praise faith and purification of obscurations.Different diets nourish infants and adults; likewise, the subjects of teachingmust be determined in relation to the audience. Teach beginners such subjects asthe difficulty to gain a free and fully endowed human birth, death andimpermanence, the relation between actions and their consequences, and thesufferings within the round of rebirth. Teach those who have already entered theBuddhist path the distinction between the lesser and great ways, and theirrespective basis, path, and result. Teach persons such as individuals who workfor others’ good subjects including the five major subjects of Buddhistculture—grammar, logic, art, medicine, and Buddhist studies. Teach groups ofscholars distinctions that can be found among non-Buddhist and Buddhistphilosophies and a detailed outline of them. Teach special recipientsexplanations of tantras and impart the gift of pith instructions. For supremelyfortunate disciples, provide guidance in the essential meaning of the veryprofound abiding nature, great perfection. For all those of dull or foolishminds, praise such subjects as the cultivation of stores of goodness and wisdom,purification of obscurations, prostrations, offerings, faith, and humility. TheTantra That Extracts the Essential Meaning states:These preliminary practices are techniques to purify your stream of being:Reflection on the difficulty of attaining this support (that is, life as a humanbeing),On impermanence, and on the flaws of the round of rebirth;Purification of negative acts; refuge; vows; and other subjects.Once completed, follow this with the stages of philosophyOf the hearers and others. Having correctly entered the path,You become endowed with compassion and sublime insight,Then begin this text, the correct, definitive meaning.In following this progression, you will accomplish great goals.In particular, three styles of guidance are known for those endowed with apropensity for the great way’s enlightened heritage: the effortless path, like agaruda’s descent from above; the graded path with characteristics, like amonkey’s ascent from below; and the small footpath based on disciples’intellects. These approaches liberate disciples endowed with positive karmicpropensities. Nevertheless, for those with inferior or uncertain karmicconnections, they can prove very harmful; therefore, such individuals shouldtrain gradually.When clear, pure, and pleasant-sounding words are used to present the teachingto either embellish or synthesize, for example, disciples will easily comprehendordered, detailed explanations, and their doubts will be resolved. Faults inteaching that must be avoided are inappropriate contexts, unexplained symbols,mistakes in words or meanings, digressions of mind, speech motivated by themental afflictions, obscure terms, excessive or insufficient details, formerpremises that contradict the latter, asides planted within the teaching thatcensure your own circle of disciples or others, mixing pure speech with vulgarlocal language, and instruction unsuited to the disciples’ intellects.Teach with impeccable eloquence. When words are clearly audible, filling thesurroundings, and are pleasant to hear, everyone listens enthusiastically. Surewords and meanings dispel doubts. Skill in examples and meanings edifies thelistener’s mind and facilitates understanding. Teaching adapted to thedisciples’ intellects becomes meaningful.Occasional recounting of amazing stories prevents the listeners’ feeling ofgrief. Adding words found in the treasure-chest of scripture and reasoningprecludes confusion or mistakes. Articulation of opposing views and their faultsshows skill in stemming errors. Teaching consistent with all Buddhist ways isaccepted by all. Easily understood teaching, free from vulgar local language, isworthy to be remembered. To be skillful in elaboration and summarization is tohave gained mastery in teaching. To teach at a leisurely pace, with a wideperspective, without hesitation or fatigue, is what is called “teaching with theriches of positive qualities.”How Teaching Completes the Stores of Goodness and Wisdom [H]In teaching, generosity is practiced by correct explanation of words andmeaning;Ethical conduct, by freedom from the faults of mental afflictions;Patience, by forbearance of grief or fatigue; diligence, byenthusiastic teaching;Meditative stability, by remaining undistracted; and sublime insight, by makingdistinctions.While teaching, generosity is practiced by the correct explanation of words andmeanings; ethical conduct, by not mixing the teaching with the mentalafflictions; patience, by forbearance of grief or fatigue, hunger and thirst;diligence, by enthusiastic teaching without disillusionment; meditativestability, by remaining mentally undistracted while teaching; sublime insight,by making distinctions in the subjects of the teaching and realizing that theylack an intrinsic nature, as in a dream.The Dedication of Goodness and an Explanation of Teaching’s Benefits [I]“By the power of the stores of positive qualities of teaching, of hearing thedoctrine, of reflection and meditation upon it,May all beings, with me, in every lifetime, Always attain the supreme goodfortuneOf enjoying the ten ennobling acts and the ten forms of spiritual conduct.”Correct teaching’s benefitsAre enhanced memory, meditative states, self-confidence, and stilling of mentalafflictions.You preserve the teachings’ treasury, you receive teaching from the Buddha,Gods and human beings praise you, your fame increases, you achieve your goals,You are not separated from the doctrine in every lifetime,And you very quickly attain enlightenment and rain the teachings upon beings.“By the power of the stores of positive qualities of teaching, of hearing, ofreflection and meditation upon it, may all beings, with me, in every lifetime,always attain the supreme good fortune of enjoying the ten ennobling acts andthe ten forms of spiritual conduct.”Your present enjoyment of the sacred Buddhist doctrine is due to your spiritualmasters: think of their great kindness. The teaching is the Buddha’s word: thinkof his great kindness. You have listened to the teaching together with yourcompanions in the Buddhist spiritual community: think of their great kindness.Dakinis and oath-bound protectors’ power prevented obstacles to the teaching:think of their great kindness. Your parents nourished your body that practicesthe doctrine: think of their great kindness. Everything is due to the kindnessof the Buddha’s teaching: think, “May the precious teachings long endure!”Teaching’s benefits are as follows: Presentation of the doctrine with aperfectly lucid mind focused on freedom, without wishes for gain, service, orfame, has these positive effects: enhancement of memory, meditative states,self-confidence, and liberation from the mental afflictions. You preserve theteaching’s treasury; you receive teaching from the Buddha; gods and human beingspraise you and are inspired by you; you will accomplish every excellent goal;you are not separated from the sacred doctrine in every lifetime; you veryquickly attain enlightenment and then the rain of your teachings brings yourdisciples to spiritual maturity; and you will quickly attain all goals, forothers and yourself. The Matrix of Awareness Discourse states:Merely hearing the names of secret mantra’s wisdom deities puts an end toninety-three eons of accumulated obscurations. Each recitation aloud of theirname in a retention mantra has as many infinite, immeasurable benefits. Beenergetic in teaching.HOW TO LISTEN TO BUDDHIST TEACHING [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-6]This chapter has five parts: (1) how to act while listening and when to listen,(2) renunciation of impure motivation, (3) maintaining pure motivation, (4) howto complete the eighty-four ways of hearing the doctrine and the sixtranscendent perfections, and (5) dedication of goodness and the benefits ofhaving heard the teachings.How to Act While Listening and When to Listen [A]When listening to the sacred Buddhist doctrine, present a mandala and a mass ofofferings;Make prostrations, and kneel or sit straight with folded hands.When conducive conditions are gathered, listen respectfully without distraction.Present a mass of offerings, such as a throne for teaching and a seat, incense,flowers, and lamps; and present a mandala that includes precious substances.While listening, renounce ostentation, such as carrying a parasol, a staff, orweapons; covering your head; or wearing shoes. Do not sit with your back or sideturned toward the speaker; sit in half-lotus, crouched, or kneeling posture.Look downward with folded hands. The Discourse of Gathered Precious Qualitiesstates:Listen with this deportment of bodhisattvas:Firmly settled in supreme joy, humility, and faith,Rid yourself of mental afflictions’ obscurations, transcend defilements,Be truly engaged in serving beings, and develop certain sublime insight.Male persons clearly imagine themselves as Gentle Splendor; female persons, asTara. Think that from the speaker’s mouth, the doctrine’s light shines andtouches the heart of each person, rids each of the darkness of ignorance, andcauses the lotus of their intelligence to blossom. This is a profoundinstruction.When a teaching effectively counteracts your mental afflictions, its depth hasreached your stream of being. You should listen when you have the intention toundertake Buddhist practice or when young, during your hearing of a number ofsubjects, vast as an ocean. Generally, when entering Buddhism, you must firstlisten to teachings since, when you know the round of rebirth’s flaws and thepositive qualities of transcendent states, you will engage in correct conduct.When training your mind, you must listen, since this counteracts ignorance inany subject. Even when continually engaging in Buddhist experientialcultivation, you must listen, since this enriches your experience, such asbringing increased firmness to your ennobling practice. Even when every part ofyour conscious stream of being is liberated, you must listen, since thisresolves any formulation of doubt.If you first regard any measure of your listening with attachment, thinking,“That much is enough!” and then engage in meditation practice in seclusion, youwill not recognize the extremes in your thinking, and thus not sense that youhave taken a mistaken or misleading path. Although in others’ sight you willseem to be someone who has practiced Buddhism, you will not profit from this atall. The Pattern of the Stem Discourse states:Child of the enlightened heritage! If you wish to rapidly reach manifest,perfect enlightenment, you must train in striving to cross an ocean oflistening!Renunciation of Impure Motivation [B]When listening, avoid a vessel’s three faults,Six impurities, and thirty-six shortcomings—Six acts of obstructive influences, six acts that cause obscurations,Six causes of abandoning the teachings, six faults of distraction,Six faults of misleading yourself, and six forms of spirituality contrary to thegreat way.A vessel’s three faults resemble the following: the vessel’s mouth turnedupside-down, a vessel’s base that leaks, and poison within the vessel. First,nectar can be poured onto a vessel turned upside down but not even one drop willenter it. This illustrates not paying attention to the teachings’ presence, orto seem attentive but to slumber, to sink into dullness, to play, to joke, or toponder something else. Second, water can be poured into a vessel that leaks fromits base, but it will seep out and disappear. This illustrates retaining theteaching while present but not making an effort to familiarize yourself witheach teaching you have heard by repeatedly recalling it: you forget. Third,water poured into a poisoned vessel fills it and remains inside, but can neverbe used. Likewise, once you fall under the sway of the mental afflictions, eventhough you have heard many teachings, increasing mental afflictions such aspride taint your knowledge. The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of SublimeInsight states:Listen well, listen thoroughly, and retain what I say; I will teach you.To “listen well” corrects the fault of containing poison. To “listen thoroughly”corrects the fault of a vessel turned upside-down. To “retain” corrects thefault of a leaking base.Six impurities are mentioned in The Rational System of Exposition:The impurities are pride, lack of faith,Lack of interest,Outer distraction, inner self-absorption,And listening with distress.Listen having abandoned these six: listening with particularly swollen pride,dressed fashionably, seated on a high seat, and so on; listening without faithin the doctrine, your companions, or the spiritual master; listening without thewish or intention to practice Buddhism; allowing your eyes, ears, or mind tobecome entranced with outer objects; becoming inwardly self-absorbed, such as insleep or dullness; and listening with feelings of distress that impede theteachings, such as, “What’s the use of this teaching?!”Don’t give rise for even an instant to thoughts of the teacher’s faults, suchas, “This teacher comes from a bad background,” “doesn’t understand Buddhism,”“has few possessions,” “has coarse mental afflictions,” “is wrathful, isfierce,” “has an unpleasant voice,” “wears poor robes,” “is poor and destitute,”or “is accompanied by bad persons.”Among thirty-six shortcomings, The Complete Array of Qualities Discourse listssix acts of obstructive influences:Laziness, apathy, lack of faith in the teaching and the teacher, lack of serviceto the spiritual guide, to not consider the doctrine as it is given, and toreject consideration of karma and its ripening due to mundane considerations.The Discourse Requested by Ocean of Intellect lists six acts that causeobscurations:Once obstructive influences have entered your stream of being, to have yourpride swell; to abandon Buddhism due to karmic obscurations; to search out andlisten attentively to teaching of materialists’ secret logical syllogisms; tonot heed the collection of bodhisattva instructions; to harbor negative viewstoward spiritual guides; and to harbor negative views toward the doctrine.The same text lists six causes of abandoning the doctrine:To feign physical and mental positive attitudes with a desire to commitwrongdoing; due to pride, to disrespect the one who expresses the doctrine; tonot request teaching due to doubt; to gain wrong livelihood by means of feigningBuddhist practice; to be disrespectful to your parents, preceptor, or master;and to constantly argue in disharmony due to mental or physical roughness.The same text lists six faults of distraction from the teachings:To entertain many mundane projects; to own many material possessions; to listento much insignificant talk; to have many misleading companions among family andfriends; to entertain many misleading thoughts; and to have many sicknesses andobstructive influences due to negative karma.The Discourse Requested by Drita-rashtra lists six faults of wrongful lack ofprinciples:To not recall the great kindness you have received but to be deceptive; topractice Buddhism out of attachment to gain or honor; to regard others’possessions with jealousy and greed; to not think of the Buddhist teachers’qualities but to look for mistakes; to have faith in and to rely upon amisleading master; and to search for concepts rather than for the positivequalities of goodness.The Discourse of Gentle Splendor’s Manifestation lists six forms of spiritualitycontrary to the great way:To not seek the collection of bodhisattva teachings; to seek non-Buddhistmiracles; to engage in worldly work rather than to seek erudition; to pursuestudy through terminology; due to that, to not seek liberation; and to notsearch for spiritual guides due to desire for proficiency in the subjects ofBuddhist culture.Maintaining Pure Motivation [C]Maintain pure motivation by means of six precious attitudes, six hardships,Six armors unaffected by circumstances, six goals,Six necessities, and six ways to seek instruction.The Discourse Requested by Suvatu lists the six precious attitudes, theperceptionof spiritual masters who express the doctrine as a treasure of jewels; of theteachings as a wish-fulfilling jewel; of hearing the doctrine as an extremelyrare opportunity; that to preserve and reflect upon the doctrine is meaningfulbecause they are precious; that the opportunity to contemplate the teachingscannot be regained, even in one hundred lifetimes; and that those who abandontheir search for the teachings have declined nectar in order to drink poison.Listen to the doctrine and contemplate it with these perceptions, and stabilizeyour intent to make this opportunity meaningful.The same text lists forbearance of six hardships:Wherever spiritual guides or the Buddhist doctrine can be found, to forbearmental afflictions due to hot or cold temperatures, hunger and thirst, criticismor scolding, fatigue from journeys or activity, giving or searching fornecessities, and even harm to your precious physical well-being.The same text lists the six armors unaffected by circumstances:Energetic application, undaunted even if beaten by clubs, given to thefollowing: presenting the teachings or to their assiduous spiritual practice; tocultivation of great learning; to preservation of great learning; to knowledgeof the doctrine’s meaning; to having your behavior conform to the doctrine; andto having others rely on the teachings as described and to honor them.The same text lists six special goals to be undertaken:Undertake these six goals: knowledge of all sources of ennobling acts; once yougain that knowledge, to put them into practice accordingly; to develop supremecompassion toward sentient beings; to retain the entire sacred doctrine; to notinterrupt the three jewels’ lineage; and to bring sentient beings to completespiritual maturity.The Discourse Requested by Kashyapa lists six necessities to be practiced:It is necessary to listen to and to know the specific details of the teachings;with this knowledge, to not commit unsanctioned acts; to teach this to others;to have yourself and others attain complete liberation by such teaching; to haveyourself and others train in sublime insight; and to resolve the doubts ofpersons who come from the four directions. Be diligent in listening with thesesix.The very extensive, great Flower Ornament Discourse lists six ways to seekinstruction:Fully seek for the doctrine in these ways: seek the doctrine sincerely, withoutguile or deceit; seek not for your own benefit, but for the good of all; seekwithout the wish for gain or service, but with the wish that beings renouncetheir mental afflictions; without concocting the doctrine, to seek withcomprehension of sublime insight; seek unequivocally, to resolve everyone’sdoubts; and seek without conceit or desire, in order to realize the Buddha’sentire doctrine.How to Complete the Eighty-Four Ways of Hearing the Doctrine and the SixTranscendent Perfections [D]When listening in eighty-four ways,The mandala and other offerings constitute generosity;Control of body, voice, and mind, ethical conduct; forbearance of difficulty,patience;Enthusiasm, diligence; undistracted attention, meditative stability;Clarification of misunderstandings, sublime insight.The Discourse Requested by Inexhaustible Intellect states:Bodhisattvas hear the doctrine in eighty-four ways: (1) with focused intention,(2) with motivation, (3) with noble intent, (4) with application, (5) as aspiritual guide, (6) without pride, (7) with care, (8) with veneration, (9) inharmony, (10) happy with the canon, (11) with reverence, (12) with service, (13)with esteem, (14) turning their ears toward the teachings, (15) attentively,(16) without distraction, (17) in stillness, (18) with the perception of theteaching as a wish-fulfilling jewel or as medicine, (19) to expel the chronicsickness of the mental afflictions, (20) with the vessel of memory, (21) withthe knowledge of understanding, (22) with the wish for intelligence, (23) withintellectual receptivity, (24) insatiable in listening to the doctrine, (25)with increasing giving, (26) with discipline and alert senses, (27) withreliance on the learned, (28) with joyful humility, (29) with physical ease,(30) with verbal quietude, (31) with thorough mental joy, (32) without feelingsof grief, (33) attentive to the words, (34) with reflection on the meaning, (35)with excellent behavior, (36) listening assiduously, (37) listening to others’teachings, (38) listening to gather others, (39) as if not having previouslyheard the doctrine, (40) with clairvoyance, (41) not wanting another way ofspiritual development, (42) with the transcendent perfections, (43) with thecollection of bodhisattva teachings, (44) with skillful means, (45) with purity,(46) with mindfulness, (47) with skill in taking birth, (48) with skill in nottaking birth, (49) hearing about the repulsive, (50) hearing about love, (51)hearing about interdependent arising, (52) hearing about impermanence, (53)hearing about suffering, (54) hearing about the absence of an existent self,(55) hearing about peace, (56) hearing about emptiness, (57) hearing aboutabsence of characteristics, (58) hearing about aspirationlessness, (59) withoutmanifest formations, (60) with gathering ennobling acts, (61) with the blessingof truth, (62) without waste, (63) independently, (64) guarding their own minds,(65) guarding others’ concerns, (66) eradicating the mental afflictions, (67)with the support of the seven treasures of the exalted, (68) eradicatingdestitution, (69) with praise by the wise, (70) with joy from the wise, (71)with the omniscience of the exalted, (72) to inspire beings who are not sublime,(73) with the sight of truth, (74) with renunciation of the psychophysicalaggregations’ faults, (75) weighing the faults of composite phenomena, (76)relying on the meaning, (77) relying on the doctrine, (78) relying on wisdom,(79) relying on the discourses of certain meaning, (80) without any negativeact, (81) with benefit for others and themselves, (82) without regret towardprevious excellent ennobling acts, (83) with distinct improvement, and (84) toreceive the Buddha’s entire doctrine.When listening to Buddhist teaching, offerings constitute generosity;

The benefits of having listened to the teachings are gain of sublimeinsight; meditative states; retention of the teachings’ stream and so on; eyesthat discern correct conduct; increase of ennobling acts; diminished wrongdoing;praise from gods and humans; banishment of the darkness of ignorance; and swiftattainment of enlightenment, after which you will turn the unsurpassable wheelof the doctrine. The Gong Discourse states:Hearing the sound of the beaten drum or gongThat announces the presentation of the sacred Buddhist doctrineLeads to the attainment of awakening:What need is there to mention the even greater benefits of listening to theteachings thus announced!THE SIX STYLES OF FAITH, THE FOUNDATION OF THE SACRED BUDDHIST DOCTRINE [III][05_toc-title.html#sec-7]This chapter has eight parts: (1) the nature of the six styles of faith, thesource of all forms of Buddhism, (2) sure examples of faith, (3) the harm inlacking faith, (4) the object and causes of faith, (5) forsaking conditions thatcloud faith, (6) indications of the arising of faith, (7) tireless and steadfastfaith, and (8) the benefits of having engendered faith.The Nature of the Six Styles of Faith, the Source of All Forms of Buddhism [A]Styles of faith in ennobling acts are described as follows:Yearning faith prompts choices in relation to acts, causes, and consequences.Devoted faith leads to dedication toward supreme ideals. Respectful faith leadsto outstanding conscientiousness. Lucid faith uplifts the mind to positivequalities.Trusting faith ends doubt concerning the teachings.Certainty in faith leads to application in hearing the doctrine, and inreflection and meditation upon it.In general, most traditional sources mention three forms of faith: lucid faith,yearning faith, and trusting faith. These are defined as full inspiration towardthe three jewels, yearning to apply the four truths, and trust in relation toteachings on acts, causes, and consequences. Here, I will present six forms offaith: yearning faith, devoted faith, respectful faith, lucid faith, trustingfaith, and certain faith. The difference between the two presentations of faithis merely a brief or extensive presentation of the same subject. Devoted,respectful, and lucid faith belong to the category of lucid faith; yearning andtrusting faith, to trusting faith; and certainty in faith, to yearning faith.First, the essence of yearning faith is the wish to choose between the round ofrebirth and transcendent states. Its definition is the yearning for and delightin positive qualities, thus yearning faith. Its three categories are the wish torenounce the round of rebirth’s suffering, the wish to attain awakening, and thewish to act based upon choices between the acts that constitute their respectivecauses. An example consistent with yearning faith is just as those who wish tobe wealthy desire riches, you wish to seek the teachings—you reject sufferingand its sources, and enter the path and the cessation of suffering. Signs ofthis faith are lack of interest in mundane activity, and the undertaking ofhearing the doctrine, and of reflection and meditation upon it. The Lamp of theJewels Discourse states its benefits:Faith is the preliminary, like a mother who gives birth:It preserves and increases all noble qualities.It dispels fears and crosses rivers.Faith illustrates the city of excellent happiness.Second, the essence of devoted faith is utter delight in spiritual masters andthe three jewels. Its definition is the devoted interest to follow those ideals.Its four categories are devotion to spiritual masters as the ones to rely upon;devotion to enlightenment as your goal; devotion to the doctrine as your path;and devotion to the spiritual community as your companions. An exampleconsistent with devoted faith is children following their mother. The sign thatthis faith has arisen in your stream of being is that you feel strongly movedand you spontaneously express your positive feelings at the sight, sound, orrecollection of the spiritual masters and the three jewels who have placed youon the path to freedom. The previous text states its benefits:Great individuals’ attitudes have arisenWith faith in the buddhas and the teachings,Inspiration toward the conduct of the Buddha’s spiritual heirs,And faith in unsurpassable awakening.Third, the essence of respectful faith, based upon lucid faith, is care to nottransgress the doctrine. Its definition is homage in body, speech, and mindtoward your spiritual ancestors, thus respectful faith. Its three categories arephysical respect—acting in a restrained manner, such as performing prostrationsand circumambulations; verbal respect—expressions of praise, polite speech, andservice; and mental respect—bowing humbly upon seeing a venerable person orobject. An example consistent with respectful faith is humility, like asubject’s diligent service to a monarch. Be diligent in that way. The sign thatthis faith has arisen in your being is to have no pride or haughtiness in thepresence of your spiritual ancestors. The previous text states its benefits:The root of humble respect is the relinquishment of pride.Faith, like hands, gathers the roots of ennobling acts.Fourth, the essence of lucid faith is the feeling of overt inspiration towardyour spiritual ancestors’ qualities. Its definition is lucidity in tranquilopenness that arises from joyous faith, free from the defilement of deceit. Itsthree categories are inspiration toward the relative appearances of ennoblingacts, inspiration toward the ultimate ennobling act of sublime insight, andinspiration toward the ennobling act of the integration of equal parts ofrelative ennobling acts and sublime insight. An example consistent with it is awater-purifying gem that cleans muddy water; this faith purifies the intellect’sfaulty conduct. The sign that lucid faith has arisen is that wrongdoing is notmixed with your body, speech, and mind, and you take joy in ennobling acts. Theprevious text states its benefits:Faith is the arising of utter joy in the Victor’s doctrine;Faith illustrates the city of excellent happiness;Faith pervades positive qualities and wisdom.Fifth, the essence of trusting faith is lack of doubt concerning teachings onthe subjects of the basis of Buddhism, its path, and its result. The definitionof trusting faith is undertaking the teachings’ practice in the knowledge thatthe words and meanings of reliable scripture and logic teach the import of thebasis, path, and result. Its three categories are trust that the causes andeffects of the round of rebirth must be renounced; trust that the causes andeffects of transcendent states must be cultivated; and trust that acts ofundetermined consequences are unnecessary. An example consistent with trustingfaith is cultivating crops in the belief of an eventual autumn harvest; this islike the cultivation of ennobling acts. The sign that this faith has arisen inyour stream of being is attainment of confident conviction in your belief towardthe teacher, the spiritual master, the Buddha; the doctrine, the Buddhistteachings, the lesser and great ways; the circle of disciples, the two Buddhistways’ spiritual communities; and all sacred objects that represent them. Theprevious text states its benefits:Faith’s senses are keen and illuminating;Faith’s strength cannot be overpowered by anything else;Faith forms the basis for the mental afflictions’ eradication.Sixth, the essence of certainty in faith toward the excellent doctrine isyearning for the definitive meaning, the subject of the nature of reality. Itsdefinition is settling in that meaning’s ongoing state after you have seen it.Its three categories are the faith of certainty in what teaches thatmeaning—hearing the doctrine, and of reflection and meditation upon it. Anexample consistent with certainty in faith is keeping the gold you found in ore,like cherishing the correct meaning. The sign that this faith has arisen is tonot separate yourself from the cultivation of its experience, day or night. Theprevious text states its benefits:Through faith, the state of enlightenment is attained.Sure Examples of Faith [B]The nature of faith resembles a field, a ship,An escort, a vehicle, a jewel, a warrior:You should value faith as your greatest wealth.Faith resembles a fertile field where awakening’s stems sprout abundantly. Theprevious text states:In the field of awakening, unspoiled seeds, the causes of noble qualities,Grow by means of faith.Search for the qualities that arise naturally from faith.Like an ocean vessel, faith crosses the waters of the round of rebirth. Like agood escort, faith provides protection from your enemies, the mentalafflictions. Like an excellent vehicle, faith carries you to the land offreedom. Like a jewel, faith accomplishes your hopes and wishes. Like a warrior,faith destroys corrupting acts. Faith is the first of the seven treasures of theexalted. The Discourse Showing the Transcendent Buddhas’ Inconceivable Mysteriesstates:Therefore, with faith, inspiration, devotion, and an untroubled attitude, youhave no uncertainty, doubt, or hesitation concerning acts and their maturation.With interest, understanding, and belief, you know that ennobling acts andwrongdoing and their ripening are never exhausted. Therefore, you do not commitwrongdoing even for the sake of your own life. In the spiritual practice of theten paths of ennobling activity, generosity increases your enjoyment; ethicalconduct leads to the higher realms; listening fosters sublime insight; andmeditation multiplies all noble qualities.The Harm in Lacking Faith [C]Without faith, you are like a stone on the ocean floor, a ship without acaptain,An armless person, a burnt seed, the blind.You plunge to the depths of existence and wander forever withinthe round of rebirth.Like a boulder at the ocean floor that cannot rise to the surface, withoutfaith, it is impossible to reach the dry land of freedom. Like a captainlessship that will not reach the far shore, without faith, it is impossible to crossthe waters of suffering. Like an armless person who has reached an island ofgold but cannot take anything, without faith, it is impossible for qualities toenter your stream of being. Like a burnt seed that cannot produce fruit, withoutfaith, it is impossible for awakening’s fruit to grow. Like the blind within atemple, when you are without faith, you cannot see the appearance ofspirituality. Like clever persons whose worldly skills plunge them to the depthsof the round of rebirth, when you are without faith, whatever you do remains amundane act—you can never attain the freedom of awakening. Such are the faultsof lacking faith. The Discourse of Ten Qualities states:Positive qualities do not ariseIn persons lacking faith.The Object and Causes of Faith [D]Yearning faith arises from disillusionment with existence.Devoted faith arises from disillusionment with evil companions.Respectful faith arises from disillusionment with this life.Lucid faith arises from pure, supreme ideals.Trusting faith arises from hearing about karma and consequences.Certainty in faith arises from all forms of hearing and reflection.Causes that increase faith include relying upon holy persons,Noble companions, examination of the discourses and tantras, Reflection ondeath, and acts and their consequences.These inspire increased effort in hearing and reflection, which cause faith tocontinually increase.To hear the story of a holy person’s life of freedom; to suffer harm fromdisease, demons, or enemies;To witness death; to experience sudden suffering—Once faith has arisen from having heard the teachings, it is valuable to sustainit.Yearning faith arises from disillusionment with the sufferings of existence.Devoted faith arises from disillusionment with the ideas and behavior of evilcompanions. Respectful faith arises from disillusionment with this life’sactivity. Lucid faith arises from seeing the acts and conduct of spiritualmasters, the Buddha. Trusting faith arises from hearing detailed explanations ofkarma and its consequences. Certainty in faith arises from diligence in hearingthe doctrine and reflection upon it.Causes that increase faith include reliance upon spiritual masters and holycompanions; examination of discourses’ and tantras’ texts; and reflection ondeath, and on acts, karma, and consequences. These cause faith to continuallyincrease. To hear the story of a holy person’s life of freedom; to suffer harmfrom disease, demons, or enemies; to witness death; to experience suddensuffering—when these events inspire faith, it is very valuable to sustain it.The Discourse Showing the Transcendent Buddhas’ Inconceivable Mysteries states:Therefore, since faith prevents you from entering faulty ways of conduct, allexalted ones praise it.Forsaking Conditions That Cloud Faith [E]Conditions that cloud faith include consideration of spiritual masters’ faults,Befriending common persons, increased craving for sensual pleasures,Laziness and apathy, preoccupation with this life’s affairs,And activity detrimental to your spiritual life: these are signs of demons’blessing.Once you enter the gateway to the sacred Buddhist doctrine, demons createimpediments. It is said that when you receive their “blessing,” your faithbecomes clouded. Signs that demons have entered and “blessed” you includeconsideration of your spiritual masters’ faults, consideration of the negativeaspects of practice of the teachings in general, befriending common companions,diminished diligence in experiential cultivation, unrestrained enjoyment of thefive senses’ pleasures, acute laziness and apathy toward the teachings, muchactivity in this life’s affairs, and undertaking activity detrimental to yourspiritual life. These are the signs of demons’ blessings: because of them, youfeel neither devotion nor humility toward the three jewels.Indications of the Arising of Faith [F]Indications of the arising of faith include disillusionment with the round ofrebirth;Humility toward the three jewels; exertion in hearing the doctrine, reflection,training, and vows;Practice of ennobling acts; renunciation of wrongdoing; and the arising of newnoble qualities.Indications of the arising of faith include disengagement toward the appearancesof delusion in the round of rebirth, like a nauseous person seeing food; intensedevotion and humility toward spiritual masters and the jewels, like children’syearning for their mother; exertion in hearing the doctrine and reflection uponit, like a thirsty person craving water; to cherish the training and vows, likea poor person finding gold or turquoise; joy in application to ennobling actsand experiential cultivation, like a merchant arriving at an island of gold; andfaith in all Buddhist ways, like an eager shopper going to market. When theyarise, ensure that such indications do not decline but ever increase.Tireless and Steadfast Faith [G]Faith should be free from six inconsistencies.Unchanging faith should have special qualities,Like the king of mountains, the sun, the ocean, a mother, space, a bow-string,A ship, a bridge, a stream, and a silken cord.Your faith should remain free from six inconsistencies: (1) Some beginners inBuddhist practice feign extreme faith while with spiritual masters, but whenapart, see them as worse than ordinary persons. Renounce this. (2) Some people’sfaith arises very quickly when conducive conditions are encountered, but itfades and disappears as suddenly. Renounce this. (3) Some people feign strongfaith while they have not yet received a teaching or an object they wish, orwhen in the clutches of sickness or demons. Yet, once they are cured, or getwhat they want, they abandon their faith. Renounce this. (4) Some people havefaith toward one noble practice, and then another, thus they entertain many andmake none useful. Renounce this. (5) Some people do not have any profoundteachings or masters in whom they have indivisible faith but easily accept anymaster and any teaching. Renounce this. (6) Some people are high-strung, andallow some small event to inspire faith and some small event to suddenly cloudit. Renounce this.Instead, first examine spiritual masters or teachings, then once you haveaccepted them, maintain faith and respect without subsequent fatigue,disillusionment, or fluctuations. Rely upon spiritual masters and the doctrinewith tenfold faith: unchanging and irreversible, like the sovereign mountain;vivid and without shadows, like the sun; endlessly deep, like the ocean; withoutan ulterior motive, like a mother; without limit or center, like space; withoutrelaxation, like a bow-string; without discouragement and fatigue, like a ship;unperturbed by events, such as others’ influence or due to scolding by themaster, like a bridge; continual, like a river’s stream; humble, supple, andembellished with politeness, like a silken cord.The Benefits of Having Engendered Faith [H]The benefits of faith include increase of all positive qualities,Relief from all suffering, finding the path to freedom,Benevolent gods’ protection, success in all your projects,And the attainment of enlightenment: faith’s benefits are infinite.The benefits of faith include that it forms the foundation for all positivequalities; it relieves all the round of rebirth’s sufferings; through it youfind the path to freedom; you enjoy the protection of benevolent gods; yousucceed in all your projects; buddhas and bodhisattvas continually think of you;you are reborn in the pure lands; at the end of a happy life, the buddhas andbodhisattvas guide you; thus, you have no fears during the period betweenlifetimes; you are reborn where you aspired and become a preserver of the threejewels; and you attain the exalted state of enlightenment. The Lamp of theJewels Discourse states:Some serve sentient beings as numerous as the atoms in ten realmsIn every pleasing way, during an eon.Compared to them, the goodness of those who have faith in this teachingIs particularly outstanding, goodness the first do not have.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSTeaching the sacred doctrine provides medicine that relieves beings’ torment.Teaching the sacred doctrine provides an inexhaustible treasure of goodness.Teaching the sacred doctrine crowns all beings, including the gods.Teaching the sacred doctrine forms the foundation of all welfare and happiness.Hearing the teachings, the wealth of the exalted, banishes the darkness ofignorance.Hearing the teachings, the source of happiness, opens a vault of noblequalities.Hearing the teachings is your residence, companions, possessions, path, army,and family.Reliance on hearing the teachings quickly leads to enlightenment.Faith is the underlying source for magnificent ennobling acts and well-being.Faith causes every positive quality to increase.Faith is the powerful wish-fulfilling gem that provides whatever you desire.Faith constitutes the means to realize the supreme meaning of the abidingnature.This concludes the commentary to “The Transmission of Buddhism,” Book 2 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall Buddhist ways of spiritual development.

Identification of the Nature of the Leisure and Endowments of Human Life4. The Need to Fully Grasp the Essence of Human Life Now That You Have ItThese four chapters contain a total of nineteen headings.THE DIFFICULTY OF ATTAINING A FREE AND FULLY ENDOWED HUMAN LIFE [I][05_toc-title.html#sec-8]This chapter has two parts: (1) a brief presentation of the essence of humanlife and (2) an extensive explanation of the nature of the leisure andendowments of human life.The Essence of Human Life [A]The supreme contemplation of those who hear the doctrine with faithFocuses on a jewel valuable beyond measure, the free and fully endowed humanlife,Extremely difficult to find anywhere among the six kinds of beings.Obtaining it is like a blind person finding a gem:Joyously seize its pure essence.A human life infused with Buddhist values is a jewel more precious than gold,silver, or other riches. Such a priceless, excellent life, replete with alleight aspects of leisure and ten endowments, is very hard to find among the sixkinds of beings. When you have it, you are akin to a destitute blind person whofinds a precious wish-fulfilling gem at a crossroads. With the utmost joy andgladness in your heart, grasp its pure, meaningful essence as advised in thesacred Buddhist doctrine: this will accomplish your wishes for eternalhappiness. The Discourse That Presents the Freedoms and Endowments states:It’s like this: A blind person finds a precious jewel at a crossroads. Likewise,if sentient beings who course throughout the round of rebirth blinded by thecataracts of ignorance were to attain the actual life of a human being, theywould be supremely happy. Therefore, you should always put excellent Buddhistteachings into practice.The Nature of the Leisure and Endowments of Human Life [B]This section has five parts: (1) eight restless states based in your own streamof being, (2) eight restless states due to immediate circumstances, (3) eightrestless states due to unconducive attitudes, (4) five personal endowments, and(5) five social endowments.Eight Restless States Based in Your Own Stream of Being [1]You are free from these eight unsatisfactory, restless states based in your ownstream of being:In hell, suffering from heat and cold is unbearable.Starving spirits are exhausted by hunger and thirst.Dumb and foolish animals suffer terribly as beasts of burden.Long-lived gods have no concept of spiritual practice.Barbarians of the hinterlands live without ennobling acts and in the steadyincrease of wrongdoing.Those who are mute or mentally handicapped cannot comprehend words or meanings.Those who hold wrong views abjure correct views.During dark eons, people live in ignorance of the subject of which acts toundertake and which to reject.Meditate joyfully that you have attained an exemplary, untroubled life, freefrom these eight unsatisfactory, restless states based in your own stream ofbeing: (1) If you had been born in the hells, you would have to experienceintense, unbearable, constant suffering in the eight hot hells, eight coldhells, or occasional or neighboring hells: you would have no leisure to putBuddhism into practice. (2) If you had been born a starving spirit, extremehunger and thirst’s blazing fires would thoroughly exhaust your body, voice, andmind. In such despair, when would you have the leisure to put Buddhism intopractice? (3) If you had been born an animal, as a very dull and foolish beast,others would force you into their service; your flesh, hides, and so on, theirbounty. Animals eat one another and suffer terribly, unbearably. How could youhave the leisure to put Buddhism into practice?In these three cases, torment from physical suffering prevents the experience ofleisure.(4) Long-lived gods who dwell in the formless realm or on the four levels ofmeditative stability do not even conceive of the need for spiritual practice.Thus they have no leisure.These last four experience a lack of leisure due to external circumstances: (5)If you had been born among barbarians or others in the hinterlands, you wouldlive without engaging in ennobling acts and in the steady increase ofwrongdoing: you would have no leisure to put Buddhism into practice. (6) Themute, unable to express themselves with language, and the mentally handicapped,unable to distinguish between which acts to reject and which to undertake,cannot accurately comprehend the doctrine’s words and meanings: they have noleisure to put Buddhism into practice. (7) Those whose stream of being iscontaminated with wrong views of eternalism or nihilism criticize and disparagecorrect, supreme views: they have no leisure to put pure Buddhism into practice.(8) If you had not been born during an eon of illumination when buddhas appear,but had been born in a dark eon during which the sun of the Buddha had notdawned in the world, you would live in ignorance concerning how to choosebetween positive, ennobling acts to be cultivated and corrupting wrongdoing toreject: you would have no leisure to put Buddhism into practice.These are the four inner restless states, thus eight in all. These four lackleisure due to the mind: long-lived gods, people of the hinterlands, personswith wrong views, and those born during dark eons.Joyfully meditate that you have acquired this exemplary human life, free fromthese eight restless states based in your own stream of being, and endowed witheight innate forms of leisure. The Concise Discourse of the Perfection ofSublime Insight states:Those who abandon the eight restless states always find leisure.The Major Commentary to “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight ThousandStanzas” states:The eight restless states are these:Hell beings, starving spirits, animals,Long-lived gods, barbarians, those born at a time without buddhas,Those holding wrong views, and the mute or mentally handicapped.Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:To hold wrong views; or to be born an animal,Starving spirit, hell being,In a time or place without the Buddha’s word,A barbarian in the hinterlands, mute or mentally handicapped,Or a long-lived god: any of these birthsIs known to have the fault of the eight restless states.Once you have gained freedom from them,Strive to prevent rebirth there!Eight Restless States due to Immediate Circumstances [2]Renounce these eight restless states due to immediate circumstances:Corrupting acts due to the five poisons’ turmoil;To fall under misleading companions’ influence due to foolish and deludedthinking;To fall into demons’ clutches due to mistaken views and conduct on a wrong path;Distraction by indolence although you intended to further your spiritualtraining;Although diligent, to be tormented by events when the lake of your bad karmaoverflows;To belong to the class of servants who live helplessly in others’ power;To strive for materialistic goals because you entered the teachings for thislife’s sake;To practice Buddhism for gain, fame, or honor because your spiritual practice iscontrived.The Precious Wish-Fulfilling Jewel states:Troubled by the five poisons, dull and foolish, clutched by demons,Indolent, the wide lake of karma has overflowed,Under another’s control, seeking security, and contriving spirituality:These are the eight restless states due to immediate circumstances.They indicate an unworthy, unqualified vessel for instruction on the path tofreedom.Eight Restless States due to Unconducive Attitudes [3]Eight restless states due to unconducive attitudes are the following:To be bound by cords of attachment to family, friends, food, or wealth;To have ignoble behavior and character that makes spiritual practiceunprofitable;To feel no fear toward the sufferings of the round of rebirth orthe miserable existences;To feel no faith whatsoever in ennobling acts;Your acts in thought, word, and deed consist of corrupting wrongdoing;To never consider the positive qualities of ennobling acts or the sacreddoctrine;To have damaged your vows of individual liberation or of awakened mind;To have violated secret mantra’s principal or secondary bonds.Freedom from these twenty-four (three groups of eight) unsatisfactory, restlessstates is crucial.The Precious Wish-Fulfilling Jewel states:To be tightly bound with attachment; to have particularly ignoble behavior;To not fear the round of rebirth; to have no faith whatsoever;To perform corrupting wrongdoing; to have no consideration for the doctrine;To allow vows or tantric bonds to be damaged:These are known as the eight restless states due to unconducive attitudes.With them, the teachings are distant and the lamp on the path to freedom dims.Five Personal Endowments [4]Five personal endowments must be complete:Previous spiritual training in ennobling acts has awakened—you attained a humanbirth.You were born in a central country where the doctrines of Buddhist teaching andpractice have spread.You possess the supreme conditions for spiritual practice—all your senses areintact.You have not transgressed the laws of karma because you feel inclined towardennobling acts.You have faith in the sanctuary of faith, the three jewels.Strive at spiritual life when you have gained the special conducivecircumstances of all five personal endowments, as follows. (1) The endowment oflife as a human being: you attained a precious human body due to the awakeningof your previous series of lifetimes’ excellent habits of training in ennoblingacts. (2) The endowment of the country: you have been born in a central countrywhere the epitome of the Buddha’s scriptural word and realization—the doctrinesof instruction and meditation practice—spread very widely and flourish. (3) Theendowment of the qualities of the sense faculties: you possess the supreme,conducive condition for correct spiritual practice—your body, including yoursenses and limbs, is complete. (4) The endowment of not transgressing the lawsof karma: you have not transgressed the laws of karma by becoming a butcher, forexample, and you feel very inclined toward ennobling acts. (5) The endowment offaith: you feel faith in the sanctuary of faith, the precious three jewels.The Discourse That Presents the Freedoms and Endowments states:To have attained a human life, to have been born in an exalted country, to havethe sense faculties intact, to have not transgressed the laws of karma, and tohave faith in the sacred representations of Buddhism: these five are the fivemagnificent endowments that depend on you.Five Social Endowments [5]The twelve unsurpassable teachers have appeared in this world.They turned the wheel of the doctrine’s nine ways of discourses and tantras.The general and specific durations of the doctrine have not expired.Many persons have entered the teachings’ gate and accomplished the two goals.Qualified spiritual masters have accepted you and benefactors support you.These five social endowments together with the five personal endowments comprisethe ten conducive endowments.Now that they are complete, accomplish your long-term aspirations.The five social endowments are as follows. (1) The endowment of the teacher:from the time when human life span was unlimited until the present period duringwhich life expectancy is one hundred years, a series of twelve teachers ofunsurpassable great perfection has appeared. (2) The endowment of the teachings:these twelve turned the inconceivable wheel of the doctrine’s nine ways ofdiscourses and tantras. (3) The endowment of time: the duration of the doctrinehas not expired. This refers to the fact that the five-thousand-year generalduration of the Buddha’s teaching has not elapsed; and specifically, that greatperfection teachings will increasingly spread until human life expectancydiminishes from sixty to ten years. (4) The endowment of others’ following theteachings: many others have entered Buddhism through the sacred doctrine’s gate,and spontaneously accomplish the two goals—their own and others’ well-being. (5)The endowment of conducive circumstances: you have good fortune in thatspiritual masters replete with all the qualifications of spiritual guides haveaccepted you, and benefactors provide you with conducive conditions for yourpractice.These five social endowments together with the five personal endowmentsconstitute the ten conducive endowments: now that they are complete, you shouldachieve your long-range aspirations—the sacred exalted state of enlightenment.The Discourse That Presents the Freedoms and Endowments states:The five magnificent social endowments are these: a Buddha appeared, heenunciated the doctrine, his sacred doctrine endures, other persons engage init, and others give you their loving support to put Buddhism into practice.THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING SUCH A LIFE, BASED ON EXAMPLES AND NUMBERS [II][05_toc-title.html#sec-9]This chapter has two parts: (1) examples to illustrate the difficulty of findingsuch a life and (2) numbers to illustrate the difficulty of finding such a life.Examples to Illustrate the Difficulty of Finding Such a Life [A]To give an example, to attain a precious human birth is rarerThan for a turtle to stick its head through the holeOf a yoke adrift on the open seas.It is more difficult to be born with a body possessing these qualitiesThan for beans to sprout on the surface of a plastered wall.It is even more difficult than for a mustard seed to grow on the point of aneedle.To give examples, obtaining a precious human birth is much rarer than for ablind turtle to stick its head through the hole of a yoke adrift on the wide andopen seas. It is more difficult to take rebirth with a body possessing thesequalities than for scattered beans to sprout on the surface of glass or aplastered wall. It is rarer to attain a human birth than for mustard seedspoured on the point of a needle to grow there. A discourse states:O fully ordained ones! If the entire world were to become a single ocean and ifa long-lived, blind turtle lived within it and came to the surface once everyhundred years, and if on that wide ocean, a single yoke with one opening wascarried by the east wind toward the west, then carried by the west wind towardthe east, and similarly carried to all points of the compass, would the turtlestick its neck through the hole in the yoke or not?The circle of monks replied: If the ocean were small, it might be possible, butthe ocean is wide. If the yoke stayed in one place and had many openings, itmight be possible, but it drifts from east to west and then south and north, andit has but one opening. If the turtle was not stationary, always swimming on thesurface of the ocean, and if it had eyes, it might be possible, but it comes tothe surface once every hundred years and is blind. Therefore, it would never putits neck through the opening.O fully ordained ones! There would be a time when such a blind turtle who movesin that way would put its neck through the opening of the yoke. But, monks, Itell you that to attain a human birth is much more difficult than that!Further,Since this is the case, don’t allow this leisure of yours to become meaningless!Once your life becomes a restless state, it can’t be restored to one of leisure:that’s for sure!Another discourse [The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse] states:O monks! If someone quickly throws grains on the eye of a needle he or she hasplaced standing up, it would be exceedingly difficult for them to grow in theneedle’s eye. Likewise, it is rare to become a human being with all yourfaculties intact.Further,If someone had built a sturdy wall, smoothed its surface well, and beans werethrown toward it, it would be difficult for one or two to not fall, but tosprout there. Likewise, it is difficult to attain the magnificent leisure ofhuman life.Numbers to Illustrate the Difficulty of Finding Such a Life [B]Concerning number, humans, animals, starving spirits,And hell beings are like daytime stars and stars at night:The former is far outnumbered by the latter.It is said that animals fill the oceans like the fermented grains left afterbeer has been brewed;Starving spirits cluster like snowflakes in a snowstorm;And hell beings are as numerous as the particles of dust on the earth.If the number of humans is compared to daytime stars, the number of animalsequals the stars at night. Or, if animals are the daytime stars, starvingspirits are the stars at night. Or, if starving spirits are the daytime stars,hell beings equal the stars at night.Likewise, it is said that animals fill the outer oceans like the fermentedgrains left after beer has been brewed; starving spirits cluster like snowflakesin a snowstorm; and the number of hell beings equals the particles of dust onthe earth. If you calculate the number of animals in one forest, in one valley,in one anthill, or in one dirty swamp, by comparison, the attainment of a humanbody is even rarer than gaining the rank of a universal emperor.THE NATURE OF THE LEISURE AND ENDOWMENTS OF HUMAN LIFE [III][05_toc-title.html#sec-10]This chapter has three parts: (1) a mere human life, (2) the special human life,and (3) the precious human life.A Mere Human Life [A]Mere human beings have no notionOf ennobling acts or wrongdoing and their ripening:Their evil behavior leads them to fall to the miserable existences’ endlessdepths.Mere or common human beings do not consider undertaking ennobling acts. Theyexert themselves in body, speech, and mind to perform wrongdoing, the tencorrupting acts. In future lifetimes they will only experience repeated seriesof sufferings in the three miserable existences. The Precious Sky Discoursestates:Some, due to previous ennobling causes, have been born into the human world,have unimpaired faculties, and live in a land where the Buddhist teachings arealways practiced. Nevertheless, because they have no notion of acts and theirripening, they often take corrupting paths. Although they might be called “humanbeings,” they are only mediocre: after death, they fall to the endless depths ofthe miserable existences.The Special Human Life [B]Special human beings, either householders or practitioners,Confound ennobling acts and wrongdoing—Sometimes they perform spiritual acts, but mostly materialistic ones.At death, they have nothing but the seed of freedom.Special human beings usually perform corrupting acts but sometimes act nobly. Atdeath, they have nothing but the seeds of freedom rather than freedom itself.The Precious Sky Discourse states:Among sentient beings’ realms, when those who have not entered this doctrine, oreven those who have, mix ennobling and corrupting activity and strive atbusyness and distraction, their body, speech, and mind become rough andcareless. They fall to the miserable existences and remain in the lower realms.However, the sunlight of the Buddha’s nondual compassion sees beings with suchkarma and provides them with the seeds of freedom which will be activated aftera long time. Therefore their human life is special.The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse states:Kashyapa! The monk Devadatta heard and retained as many discourses as a largeNepalese elephant can carry, but due to the force of his corrupting acts, hefell to the lower realms. Consider him!The Precious Human Life [C]The precious human life is the supreme support or vessel for the practice of theBuddhist teachings.Such persons diligently apply themselves to hearing the doctrine, and toreflection and meditation upon it, subduing well their own minds,And they energetically bring others to the correct path.The victors have commended and praised this life as sublime.The precious human life is a life dedicated entirely to concerted hearing thesacred Buddhist doctrine, and to reflection and meditation upon it. Such personsfirst thoroughly tame their own mind and then guide others with skillful means.The Discourse of Shrigupta states:Shrigupta! To become well-versed in these teachings, first hear them, thenreflect on their meaning. Apply them in contemplative practice using meditationfree from mental afflictions, and encourage others to do so. This is the mostsublimely beautiful life in the world, including that of the gods. This iscalled “using the essence of a free and fully endowed life.” It is also called“the precious free and fully endowed life.”The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! Bodhisattvas who themselves engage in ennobling conduct and encourageothers to do so make use of the essence of their free and fully endowed life.All buddhas commend, praise, and esteem them.THE NEED TO FULLY GRASP THE ESSENCE OF HUMAN LIFE NOW THAT YOU HAVE IT [IV][05_toc-title.html#sec-11]This chapter has seven parts: (1) certainty concerning what human life supports;(2) the need for exertion now—without it, you will later suffer within the roundof rebirth; (3) the need to grasp the essence of life with the support of thedoctrine of path and result; (4) the need to spurn meaningless acts; (5) theneed for exertion in spiritual practice while the circumstances are conducive;(6) abandonment of six faults and exertion in any practice of ennobling acts;and (7) the benefits of reflection on the difficulty of attaining a free andfully endowed human life.Certainty Concerning What Human Life Supports [A]Even the Buddhist teachings depend on the mind.The mind is based upon this free and fully endowed life. Therefore, when all thecauses and conditions are gathered,Make subduing the mind the focus of your Buddhist practice.When you have this excellent free and fully endowed life, subdue your mentalstream of being by reflecting on the words and meaning of the subject, thedifficulty of attaining a free and fully endowed human life. The DiscourseRequested by Ocean of Intellect states:Lord of Nagas! Mind is the root of all phenomena: They arise from mind andemanate from mind; thus, you should know thoroughly the mind’s nature.The Need for Exertion Now; Without It, You Will Later Suffer Within the Round ofRebirth [B]Now that you have it, ride the ship of the free and fully endowed human lifeAcross the wide sea of existence’s unbearable suffering.If you do not make this exemplary life a vessel for the teachings,The round of rebirth’s many sufferings will torment you later.Since time immemorial, you have not freed yourself from the round of rebirth’swide sea of suffering. Therefore, now that you have this excellent ship repletewith leisure and endowments, use it to cross that ocean however you can.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Ride the ship of your human life to freedomAcross the wide river of suffering.Later, such a ship will be difficult to find:Fools do not wake from sleep in time!If you do not make this precious human life an excellent vessel to fill with theteachings’ nectar, existence’s myriad sufferings will later torment you. TheTale of the Buddha’s Past Life in an Iron House states:Although I attained the vessel of the free and fully endowed human life,I didn’t collect a drop of the teachings.Thus the unbearable fires of hell now burn me;I am tortured by my long-lasting karma!The Need to Grasp the Essence of Life with the Support of the Doctrine of Pathand Result [C]Like returning empty-handed from an isle of jewels,To waste this free and fully endowed life in meaningless acts is unconscionable.Since time immemorial, sufferings of existence have fallen like rain,The fault of not reflecting on the difficulty of attaining this human life.Upon the attainment of the precious human bodyDepends the support for the doctrine of the lesser and great ways, discoursesand mantra;And the results of the paths of hearers, solitary sages, arhats, the victors’heirs, and sublime victors.Therefore, grasp the essence of this life and always meditate joyously.To not grasp the essence of this precious human life once you attain it is morefoolish than to return empty-handed from an isle of jewels: to waste thisopportunity in meaningless acts is unconscionable. Since time immemorial,existence’s sufferings have fallen upon you like rain, due to the fault of yourlack of reflection on the difficulty of attaining this free and fully endowedlife. Based on the human body, you can put any form of Buddhism into practiceand easily accomplish any result among the three states of awakening. Therefore,you should grasp the essence of this life and always meditate joyously. Enteringthe Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Now that I have found this leisure,If I do not familiarize myself with ennobling acts,What greater deception is there?What greater folly is there?The Need to Spurn Meaningless Acts [D]You must spurn all materialistic, meaningless acts.Renounce both lifestyles’ activities: farming, companions,Fortune, giving counsel, partiality, and philosophies.You must spurn all materialistic acts. Renounce farming in the fields, sincefarming cannot be meaningful in the long term; renounce marriage and closefamily ties, since long-term relationships are meaningless; renounceaccumulation of food and fortune, since possessions cannot last; renounce givingcounsel on how to improve this life’s situation, since such advice provides nolong-term benefit whatsoever; renounce partiality to friends against foes, sincedisputes cannot prove useful in the long term; and renounce belief in extremeviews, since philosophy cannot be lastingly meaningful. The Great Transcendenceof Sorrow Discourse states:Completely reject any act affiliated with what is corrupting in life. You mustreject it just as any high person, such as a noble, avoids filth. You mustreject it in the same way that you would not put your hand into a large blazingfire. You must reject it in the same way that a brahmin refuses to eat beef. Youmust reject it just as someone who regularly eats good food does not wish forbad food. You must reject it like a universal emperor who does not give anaudience to those who have evil associates. You must reject it like a pureordained person who refuses to touch a rotten corpse.To remain in either a lay or monastic lifestyle creates a lot of activity andprovides the basis for the deterioration of spiritual life.First, in a worldly lifestyle, partiality toward friends rather than foes,caring for the needs of children and spouse, and worries concerning taxes anddamages make you a servant to tonight’s and tomorrow’s food and clothing, thwartthe completion of anything, blind you to life itself, prevent your feelingpleasure in anything you’ve done, make the day without respite and the nightwithout rest, and yet you never finish your busyness. Thoughts of spiritual lifebecome rare, and whatever you do becomes a wide arena for mingling withwrongdoing. The flames of your spouse’s attachment and anger are searing, andthe burden of your karmic debt to your children is crushing. Whatever you do,you become weighed down by an oppressive load of suffering. You suffer, but youcannot stand to see others in opulent circumstances. These events repeatthemselves many times; spiritual life becomes distant.Adopting the second lifestyle, that of an ordained person in a monasticinstitution, also entails suffering. You renounce a small home for a big one.You strive at commerce and agriculture; you make horses and donkeys beasts ofburden; you become preoccupied with increasing your wealth; you plan for yourold age; and you give counsel to close relations. You become attached to cravingfor pleasure; you long for happiness in the enjoyment of food and drink; you layplans for your residence and its protection; and you are distracted bynever-ending activity. Day and night, your horizon is defined by your attachmentor anger. You are burdened by the obligation to remember rank. Because of yourworldly pleasures, your spirituality becomes a hypocritical, false image ofsomeone who has heard the doctrine and reflects upon it. Flames of yourattachment, anger, and competitiveness tower; those attitudes’ thorns alwayssting. Whatever you do is for this life’s benefit; you always make hopefulplans. Master and disciple struggle with one another, without faith; you feeljealous competitiveness toward your spiritual brothers and sisters. Thestrongest part of your character is the mountain of your eight worldly concerns;the weakest, your behavior due to lack of hearing the teachings. So many faultsseparate your mind from spiritual life—authentic spirituality focused on freedomis very difficult! The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:It is difficult to initially renounce home life, abandoning both large and smallfamily duties.The Need for Exertion in Spiritual Practice While Circumstances Are Conducive[E]When you have these conditions, you can achieve their related work:The finest horse; warmth, moisture, and manure; a warrior’s troops;A mine; autumn crops; a guide; equipment; or servants.Likewise, energetically make your human life’s leisure and endowments meaningfulnow.When you have the finest, smartest horse, you travel fast along your way. Whenwarmth, moisture, and manure are gathered, you plant the seeds you have. Whenwarriors’ troops assemble, you defeat your enemies. When a mine of silver orgold opens, you take whatever you can. When autumn crops ripen, you harvest whatyou can. When accompanied by a guide in a dangerous place, you try to traverseit. When you have borrowed equipment, you use it energetically. When servantsapply themselves to their jobs, you accomplish your work.Just as these conditions facilitate achievement of their related activity,energetically make your human life’s leisure and endowments meaningful now byapplying yourself to spiritual practice diligently without the sense that youhave any time to spare, since impermanence will soon arrive.Abandonment of the Six Faults, and Exertion in Any Practice of Ennobling Acts[F]In any activity, such as moving about or sitting, abandon six faults, includingindolence.Like the hungry seeing foodOr the thirsty seeing drink; the destitute, wealth and possessions;Doctors, medicine; parents, their children;Those in danger seeking any refuge they can find,Practice every form—elaborate or simple—of the cultivation of ennobling acts.At all times—when moving about, standing, sitting, lying down, waking up,eating, looking around outside, talking, and so on—guard against six faults:indolence, complacency, apathy, distraction, busyness, and anything thatdisturbs the peace of your body, speech, or mind, along with acts of uncertaineffect. Carefully protect your mind with the thought, “I have entered the greatway’s sacred doctrine; I am unlike an ordinary person.”Examples to illustrate how you need not choose between formal or informalennobling practice are these: The hungry will eat any food they can, good orbad. Those tormented by thirst will drink whatever they can. The destitute willkeep any wealth they find. Skillful doctors will store any medicine they find.Parents will nurture affectionately any child born to them. Those in danger willsearch for any refuge they can find. Likewise, energetically undertake anyennobling activity you can.Don’t pass the time taking things easy, as if to say, “That is formal (that is,ritual-based) religious practice. I’m a great meditator, therefore it doesn’tapply to me. Buddhism is inactivity.” Don’t take pleasure in always lying down:be diligent in such acts as prostrations, circumambulations, reading discourses,reciting prayers, repeating mantras, meditating, or making offerings to thethree jewels. The Discourse Requested by Achintyaprabhasa states:Every joy and happiness found in the worldHas come from offerings to the three jewels:Therefore, always be diligent in offering to them.Bodhisattva Essence of Earth’s Ten Wheels Discourse states:Every joy and happiness in the worldHas come from offerings to the three jewels:Therefore, if you wish for joy and happiness,Be diligent in offering to the three jewels.At the very least, each morning, present a bowl of water as an offering. Fosterthe belief that the three jewels also reside outside yourself. Ennoblingpractice has many varieties, such as the ten forms of spiritual conduct. Thetime for such practice is variable, such as an instant, a moment, or for periodsof months or years; the essence of its substance is variable, such as formallystructured or unstructured; its techniques can have varying degrees of ease ordifficulty; and the location for such spiritual practice can be in a secludedplace or not. In every case, cultivate your experience without choosing betweenforms of ennobling practice, without self-satisfaction, and without judgment.Like a rich person who has every kind of wealth, anything can become thespiritual path for an adept. Therefore, be diligent.Further, whether your religious practice has a formal structure or not dependson your attitude. The structures of an intellectually reified belief inemptiness constrict you; whereas persons with an expansive outlook can performprostrations and offerings, yet find their realization of the nature ofreality—baseless magical appearances—makes such structured spiritual practice anaid to that realization of the nature of reality. Thus, always spend your timein ennobling activity.The Benefits of Reflection on the Difficulty of Attaining a Free and FullyEndowed Human Life [G]Energetic reflection as described leads you to forsake this life’s concerns,To strive for the next life, and to spend this life busy in the practice ofennobling acts.The blaze ignited by diligence will quickly liberate you from the ocean ofexistence:You will hold the victory banner of freedom.Reflecting day and night as described on the difficulty of attaining a free andfully endowed human life has unlimited benefits: In brief, develop the attitudethat this life’s concerns are meaningless, then don’t engage with them.Concentrate on your next life’s goals—thus, whatever you do will not contradictinstruction concerning acts and their consequences. Do not take things casually;with enthusiasm like a blazing fire, apply yourself to the meaning of hearingthe teachings, and reflection and meditation on them. Forsake misleadingcompanions, always act virtuously, and remain restrained. Give up aspirationsfor the round of rebirth; without having wasted your leisure, you will arrive atdeath happy and joyful. Untie the knot of greed: use generosity to accumulateprovisions for your journey after death—wherever you are reborn, you will not bepoor. Be always content: you will have no attachment to wealth; and your body,voice, and mind’s acts will conform with the Buddhist doctrine. All things lacka solid core; therefore, realize that whatever you have done is without meaning:cut your bonds of attachment. In the knowledge that all things will pass away,free yourself from the pain of arguments and, within your stream of being,deeply embrace ennobling acts. Seeing that whatever you have done wasunnecessary, the walls of conformity will collapse and the mountains of theeight worldly concerns will tumble. Since you have found the path to freedom,put the sacred doctrine into practice correctly and you will quickly attainenlightenment.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSNow, on this occasion of attaining an exemplary life endowed with leisure,I should now focus without distraction on techniques to reach happiness.From now on, I should develop diligent strengthTo develop the means to stop continual circling within the round of rebirth.What my eyes once found so beautiful, beautiful—enticing forms and shapes;What my ears once found so pleasing, pleasing—sounds of news I followed;What my mind once found so exciting, exciting—thoughts of this life:All has proven so truly deceptive, deceptive—life within the round of rebirth.What is certainly necessary is the Victor’s doctrine, source of everythingneeded and desired.What is certainly beneficial are the three jewels who act benevolently.What brings certain well-being are acts consistent with the doctrine, source ofwell-being.What provides certain happiness is the experience of meditation, inseparablefrom happiness.This concludes the commentary to “Our Precious Human Life,” Book 3 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall ways of spiritual development. This has been written by Longchen ChoyingTobden Dorje in order that it be known that when we have gained this supremelife of freedom, so difficult to attain, it is essential to not be attached tothis life’s meaningless projects, but to purely seize the essence of life.Fortune!This text has been printed for the benefit of the doctrine and of beings, by onewho considers the upholding, preservation, and spread of the Victor’s preciousdoctrine to be his heart’s jewel, the fully ordained monk of Buddha Shakyamuni’sorder, holder of the discipline, a reincarnation of the great scholar Bodhisato,the omniscient Tenpé Nyima Pal-zangpo."},{"pageContent":"BOOK 4REFLECTION ON DEATH AND IMPERMANENCE [05_toc-title.html#head_15]image [images/chapline.jpg]I.

A Brief Presentation of Impermanence2. The Extensive Explanation of Impermanence3. Examples to Illustrate Impermanence4. Advice to Be Diligent Because of Impermanence5. The Measure of Signs of Success in Meditation on Impermanence, and ItsBenefitsThese five chapters contain a total of nine headings.IMPERMANENCE, BRIEFLY [I] [05_toc-title.html#sec-12]Although you have gained a life with leisure, so difficult to attain,It is definitely impermanent, like a jewel found in a dream.This body and possessions, seemingly so real,Are all impermanent in their minutest detail; even your body will change intoanother.Although you have momentarily gained this human life that is so difficult toattain, it will definitely prove to be impermanent, like a jewel found in adream. You will have to abruptly leave your life’s home, body, possessions,entourage, friends, and loved ones, and from that moment on, you will have tocollect a new body, home, friends, and possessions. You should consider this.The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse states:In every world,Where there is birth, death follows.Where there is meeting, parting follows.Know that even those able to live incalculably longFinish with their longevity exhausted.The Collection of Sayings states:Alas! Composite phenomena are impermanent!That which is born will be destroyed.Since things are subject to birth and destruction,It’s best to quickly reach peace.Composite phenomena are said to resemble these:Stars, an optical illusion, a lamp,An illusion, dew, water bubbles,A dream, lightning, and clouds.IMPERMANENCE, IN DETAIL [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-13]This chapter has five parts: (1) the impermanence of all environments andbeings, (2) the impermanence of great beings, such as Brahma, Vishnu, anduniversal monarchs, (3) impermanence shown by past victors and their spiritualheirs who demonstrated the transcendence of sorrow, (4) the certainty andunpredictability of death, and (5) at death, this life’s appearances will be ofno use whatsoever.The Impermanence of All Environments and Beings [A]The four elements, Supreme Mountain, and the four continents, with the sun andmoon,And any being of the six kinds in billions of realms are impermanent.All undergo the four stages of formation, duration, destruction, and vacuity:How can this bubble-like body be permanent?None of the four major elements, Supreme Mountain, the golden mountain ranges,dancing oceans, the four continents, the iron mountain ranges, the sun and moonin this or in billions of universes, nor any of the infinite beings withinthem—gods, demigods, humans, animals, starving spirits, or hell beings—ispermanent, since all undergo the complete cycle of a great eon of the world’sformation (twenty intermediate eons), duration (twenty intermediate eons),destruction (twenty intermediate eons), and vacuity (twenty intermediate eons).Therefore, attachment to this bubble-like body is pointless. Likewise, reflectupon the impermanence of every realm in the ten directions, and have yourselffeel disillusionment. Sayings on Impermanence states:Since everything gathered will separate,It is wrong to place your confidence in anything:Eradicate desire and attachmentToward beings and toward yourself.Advice from a Spiritual Friend states:The blazing of seven sunsWill consume the Earth, the central massive mountain, and the oceans;If not even the ashes of such impressive forms will last,Why even mention the fate of this very lowly human form?The Impermanence of Great Beings, Such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, and UniversalMonarchs [B]If very powerful beings, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, planets, nagas, noxiousspirits,Universal monarchs, and others imbued with glowing strength, wealth, and gloryAre subject to impermanence,This body of negligible goodness will soon pass away.Due to their dissipating goodness, even great gods such as Brahma, Vishnu, andIndra, who temporarily enjoy the glories of mundane happiness and wealth;spirits of planets and constellations, great nagas, earth gods, and powerfulnoxious spirits; and powerful human sovereigns, such as universal monarchs whopossess the seven precious articles, are surely subject to impermanence, willperish, and will disappear. Therefore, your body and possessions of negligiblegoodness, as fleeting as lightning racing across the sky, cannot remain forever.The Transmission of the Monastic Code states:O monks! Regard these riches’ fragility and lack of a solid core! During my pastlives in the round of rebirth that I recall, I experienced inconceivable powerduring lifetimes as such beings as Brahma, Indra, or lord protectors of theworld, but in a dissatisfied state I descended to the miserable realms after mydeath.Further, the same text states:If those who live continually for an eon and whose glory is resplendent—Gods who have reached high levels of meditative stability, semihuman spirits,Demigods, seers, ascetics—are impermanent,Why even mention that humans who have undependable water-bubble bodies must eachdie and be parted?The Collection of Sayings states:A sovereign with his seven precious possessions,Lesser kings, their officials,Noble practitioners, brahmins, householders, and others—All these are impermanent,Like beings in a dream.Impermanence Shown by Past Victors and Their Spiritual Heirs Who Demonstratedthe Transcendence of Sorrow [C]Guides of this world, mighty sage buddhas; hosts of victors’ spiritual heirs;Hearers, solitary sages, the circle of disciples, and the doctrineHave previously appeared in infinite numbers but were each subject toimpermanence:This life which is like dew cannot last.During previous incalculable eons, inconceivable numbers of mighty sage buddhas;hosts of the victors’ spiritual heirs, the bodhisattvas; congregations ofhearers, solitary sages, and exalted beings; as many divine and human disciplesas there have been; along with the teachings, the sacred Buddhist doctrine, haveappeared, but all proved to be impermanent. Therefore, you cannot have theslightest confidence that this body and life-force of yours, fleeting as dew,can last. Sayings on Impermanence states:If the body of manifest buddha nature, that blazes with a thousand marks ofphysical perfection,Fashioned from hundreds of forms of goodness, is impermanent,Why won’t our bodies, unreliable as water bubbles,Not surely pass away?He who came to help beings, the sun-like Victor,With the moon of the treasure of sacred Buddhist doctrine, has set: Look!Our own splendid companions and possessionsAre all impermanent: Be aware of that, I beseech you!The Certainty and Unpredictability of Death [D]After birth, death is certainBut its time, place, and causes are not.Many things cause death; few prolong life.Time cannot be added; life passes in an instant. It is impossible to stay.All those born in the past have died: death is certain. Although in thisdegenerate time, life expectancy is unpredictable, death remains a certainty.The year, month, and time of death are impossible to determine: the time ofdeath is uncertain. There is no set place—a particular region, country, home, orbed—where you will die. Many things, such as sicknesses, demons, enemies,poisons, weapons, ravines, fire, and water, can bring rapid death. There aremany ways that things which normally sustain life, such as food, clothes,medical treatments, and wealth, can cause death. It is impossible to go back andadd time to your life—life passes in years, months, days, hours, and instants.The White Lotus of the Sacred Doctrine Discourse states:Where there is birth, death follows.Where there is meeting, parting follows.The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:Some die choking on food;Others die taking medicine.There’s no need to mention death from adverse conditions:Thus, there’s no certainty at all to the causes of death.At Death, This Life’s Appearances Will Be of No Use Whatsoever [E]At death, your home, possessions, family, glory, abilities,Masses of supporters, and other things are all of no use.Therefore, it makes sense to abandon now the projects of this life’s deludedperceptionsAnd to strive single-mindedly at the sacred Buddhist doctrine.At death, your home is of no use: even if you own a divine celestial palace, youhave to leave it behind. There is no place in the wilderness to hide from death.Your accumulated wealth is of no use: even if you own the gods’ preciouspossessions, a universal monarch’s dominion, or a wealthy person’s treasury, youhave to leave it all behind. The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conductstates:When a tree withers,What good are its branches and leaves?Likewise, when people die,What good is all they owned?At death, family and friends are of no use. Even if the universal monarch isyour friend; even if five hundred young divine spouses surround you; even ifyour one thousand young god children and cousins frolic around you; even ifIndra is your uncle; even if your dominion includes the demigods’ armies; evenif your subjects include the beings of the four continents and the heavens; evenif you own a universal monarch’s seven precious possessions; even if yourfather’s brother is Brahma or Indra; even if the four great divine kings areyour companions; even if a thousand heavenly servants attend you, none canpreserve your life-force; none can help you; none can lengthen your life; nonecan go to assist you; none can accompany you. Like a hair pulled out of butter,you are alone and must walk unaccompanied along the narrow pass between thislife and the next. The Vast Enjoyment Discourse states:When the time comes for you to leave this life, to die and go elsewhere,You will leave destitute, stricken with separation from others.You cannot return from death; you will never see them again,Like the leaves scattered from a tree; like a river’s stream.At death, a warrior’s strength is useless: there is no fight. A chief’s adviceis useless: there is no dialogue, no negotiation. Extreme speed is useless:there is no escape. Amazing beauty is useless: there is nothing to seduce.Wrathful activity is useless: there is nothing to attack. Evil deception isuseless: there is nothing to deceive. You must depart alone.Powerful friends are no use: Brahma, Indra, Ishvara, Vishnu, and other gods donot transcend death. Noxious spirits, ogres, demons, nagas, and other suchbeings are not free from it. Such means as medicine, astrology, or divinationscannot free you from it. Such things as powers of secret mantras, awarenessmantras, miraculous powers, clairvoyance are of no use. Guardians, such as malegods, protectors of the teachings, and dakinis, cannot shelter you from death.Powers gained from alchemy, from objects, or from medicine are of no use. Youmust die.Food, wealth, and possessions are useless: neither divine nectar’s sweet taste,the finest clothes of Punjabi silk, the best food of a hundred flavors, norvarious brocades and smoothest cottons. In brief, fine forms, sweet sounds,delicious tastes, enticing smells, and soft sensations are of no use: the end ofyour life has arrived.EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE IMPERMANENCE [III] [05_toc-title.html#sec-14]This chapter has two parts: (1) the example of a marketplace and (2) developmentof disillusionment through consideration of various examples.The Example of a Marketplace [A]The people gathered in one household and close entourageAre like shoppers in the marketplace—each goes his or herown way.Old or young, it is uncertain who will have to depart for the next life:Everyone should avoid animosity or quarrels and devote themselves to ennoblingacts.In marketplaces where people gather to buy or sell, at crossroads, or in hotels,many people gather for a moment. It seems lasting, but each quickly leaves inhis or her own direction. Likewise, now when you and sentient beings—yourenemies, friends, and those to whom you are indifferent—are gathered in oneplace, or when you see such a gathering, reflect that all this is transitory.Therefore, wherever you are together with parents, relatives, teachers,students, or ordinary friends, do not fight with one another, do not quarrel, donot say negative things, do not verbally abuse anyone—when you are separated,you will have no regrets.Think of when you were young, when you lived with your parents, your brothersand sisters, livestock, domestic animals, and work animals: everything seemedlike it would last forever. You were self-centered, you fought and argued, youagreed or disagreed. But where are they now? They are no longer together withyou as one: some have died. Some have gone elsewhere. Some still live together.Some are about to depart. Wherever you live, whoever your friends are, andwhatever you do, you will have to part. Keep this perception in mind and neverquarrel with anyone.Development of Disillusionment through Consideration of Various Examples [B]A tree on the riverbank, a decrepit house, an old tree trunk,Dry wood, autumn flowers, thunder or echoes,Clouds, fog, a rainbow, the sun and moon,And the extinguishing of a flame: these illustrate the body’s impermanence.Your body is like a tree growing on a steep riverbank; the Lord of Death is likethe water that erodes the earth holding the tree. Your body is like a decrepithouse in summer; the Lord of Death is the deluge that will destroy it. Your bodyis like an old tree trunk on a cliff; the Lord of Death is a violent wind thatwill topple it. Your body is like dry wood or dead grass; the Lord of Death istowering flames that will burn it. Your body is like autumn flowers; the Lord ofDeath is like that season’s wind which dries them.Loud sounds of thunder or echoes are not followed by anything. Likewise,regardless of what others say to you, pleasant or unpleasant, in praise or inblame, don’t affirm or deny it. Clouds, fog, or rainbows in space appear for amoment and then dissolve and disappear. Likewise, appearances’ outer worlds—andyour inner mind that affirms or denies them—appear suddenly, disappear just assuddenly, and pass away. Train in nonattachment to their reality. When thislife’s appearances fade and clinging based on the mind’s natural clarityvanishes, like the setting of the sun or moon, or the extinguishing of a flame,contemplate impermanence. The Discourse of Advice to the King states:Your majesty! It’s like this: For example, if four great mountains which standin the four directions—solid, firm, dense; unbroken, without crevices, veryhard; undamaged; massive, grand, reaching the heavens—were to topple to theground, all the mountains’ grass, trees, trunks, branches, leaves, and allliving beings on them would be crushed to dust. Speed could not effect anescape; force could not prevent it; wealth could not ransom it; objects,mantras, or medicine could not easily deter it.Your majesty! Likewise, four great dangers approach. Speed cannot escape them;force cannot prevent them; wealth cannot ransom them; and objects, mantras, ormedicine cannot easily deter them. What are they? Aging, sickness, death, anddecline.Your majesty! The aging that ruins youth approaches. The sickness that ruinshealth approaches. The decline that ruins all splendor approaches. The deaththat ruins vitality approaches. Speed cannot escape them; force cannot preventthem; wealth cannot ransom them; and objects, mantras, or medicine cannot easilypacify them.Further, the same text states:Your majesty! It is like this: For example, if a lion, the ruler among beasts,enters an animal’s lair and seizes it, he has the power to do as he pleases. Ananimal is powerless once between the ferocious jaws of that mighty beast.Your majesty! Likewise, once you’ve been planted on the Lord of Death’s spear,you can take no provisions; you’ll have no protector, no refuge, no supporters,no friends. Your joints will be broken and split apart; your flesh and bloodwill dry; disease will wrack your body; your throat will dry; your complexionwill change; your arms and legs will tremble; you will be unable to move; youwill have no strength; and your body will be covered in saliva, mucus, urine,and reeking vomit.The power of your senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mentalfunction—will be blocked; you will sob and breathe with rasping sounds. Yourdoctor will give up; and you will reject all medicine, sustenance, food, ordrink.You prepare to go to another world: you lie on your last bed. The beginninglesscourse of birth, aging, and death fades. Only the faintest remnant of yourvitality remains and with fear and apprehension you fall under the Lord ofDeath’s ominous power.Your breathing stops. Your mouth and nose open, and you bare your teeth. Youbeg, “Please give me something!” Your karma impels you from one life to another.You go alone, without anyone, without a companion. You leave this world behindto go toward another. You make the great migration. You enter a great darkness;you fall down a high cliff; you join a large crowd; you go into a largewilderness; a wide ocean sweeps you away; the wind of your karma pushes you; yougo in every direction without a resting place. You enter a great battle; a greatdemon seizes you; space envelops you.Your father, mother, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters gather around as youbreathe your last. Some say, “Distribute his wealth!” Some wail, “Alas, father!”or “Alas, mother!” or “Alas, child!” and tear at their hair.At that time, your previous generosity, ascetic practice, or spiritual life willbe your only companions. Apart from the doctrine, you will have no refuge, noprotection, no support. Your majesty! At that time, the doctrine will be youroasis, your home, your protection, your teacher.Your majesty! At that time, as you lie on your bed, you will experience theappearances of your future life. If you are headed for the miserable existences,those places’ terrifying appearances will loom. At that time, nothing apart fromthe doctrine can give you refuge.Your majesty! You carefully protect and perfectly care for this body of yours,but still the time will come when it will die. To live long while endowed withevery greatness, you nourish your body with many pure, satisfying foods anddrink. Yet when you lie on your deathbed, the doctors will give up, everyonewill give up, and in misery the time of your death will arrive.Your majesty! Now you wash your body, anoint it, burn incense, and wearsweet-smelling flowers. But without a doubt, at death no sweet smell will waft.Your majesty! Now you cover your body with such fabrics as the finest Benarescottons and silks, but on your deathbed, you will die clothed in filth and youwill depart alone and naked.Your majesty! Now you enjoy various sensual pleasures, but you will abandon themall without satisfaction as you die.Your majesty! Now your residence contains various perfumes, flowers, silkbanners, seats, and fabrics. You lie on your throne with cushions to your rightand left. But without a doubt you will be banished to a large charnel groundfilled with ravens, foxes, and nauseating corpses, and your lifeless body willlie there on the ground.Your majesty! Now you mount the backs of elephants or horses, accompanied byvarious kinds of attractive and pleasing music, with hoisted banners andparasols; kings, officials, family, and friends all cheering praises to you asyou proceed, looking straight ahead. However, before long, after you die on yourbed, four men will carry you; your parents, brothers, and others will beat theirbreasts and be crushed by sadness. You will be carried out through the city’ssouthern gate to a wilderness where they will bury you. Or perhaps ravens,vultures, foxes, and other animals will eat you, and your bones cremated,carried away by water, or buried: it makes no difference. The wind, sun, andrain will reduce your body to dust: it will be dispersed in every direction orwill rot.Your majesty! In these ways, all composite phenomena are impermanent; in theseways, they are unstable.Thus the Buddha taught extensively on this subject. Keep this in your heart. ACommentary to the Certain Intention states:Like the sun, moon, planets, and stars moved by energyAnd the flame of a lamp fluttering in the breeze,Life is never still for an instant:Therefore, strive to accomplish whatever goals are very meaningful.ADVICE TO BE DILIGENT BECAUSE OF IMPERMANENCE [IV] [05_toc-title.html#sec-15]At death, the three jewels and your stores of ennobling acts will surely provehelpful.Rely upon holy persons; and in everything you do, whether sitting or moving,Remember death as a means to inspire yourself to spiritual life.You should guard this as the heart of your experiential cultivation.At death and between death and your next life, spiritual masters, the threejewels, and the hosts of wisdom deities and dakinis will surely prove helpful.Your discipleship will surely prove helpful: rely on authentic spiritual masterswithout distancing yourself from them. The place of refuge that will surelyprove helpful is the three jewels: take refuge in them. The intention that willsurely prove helpful is the thought to practice the sacred Buddhist doctrine:apply yourself impartially to ennobling acts. The possessions that will surelyprove helpful are your stores of goodness and wisdom: add to them continually,without complacency. The residence that will surely prove helpful is meditativestability: build a palace of tranquility and insight. The companions that willsurely prove helpful are spiritual persons: humbly befriend your spiritualbrothers, sisters, and companions. The result that will surely prove helpful isenlightenment’s three wisdom bodies: accomplish enlightenment with diligence.The Discourse of Advice to the King states:Your majesty! Then, at that time, in that moment, your spiritual life will be anoasis, a residence, a protector, and a support. For example, it will be likefire for those tormented by cold; a cool house for those tormented by heat; acool drink for those tormented by thirst; shade for weary travelers; a vehiclefor those traveling a long road; a fine residence and bed for the tired; goodfood for the hungry; satisfaction for those who longed; a guide for those whohave lost their way; a doctor for those beset by sickness; a cord for thosesinking in quicksand; a boat for those swept away by a river; a bridge in aplace difficult to cross; stairs that lead from a frightening passage; a lamp ina dark enclosure; a ship on a wide sea; wealth for the poor; a helper for work;tools for cutting; armor for entering battle; an excellent guide in afrightening place; friendly forces in a fight; grain during famine; open spacein a cramped place; a home for wanderers; and a protector and refuge in danger.The impermanence of our steps while walking encourages us to walk to the stateof enlightenment.

Among all hoofed creatures, acalf is the best. Among all perceptions, the perception of impermanence anddeath is best: it counteracts all perceptions of the three realms.SIGNS OF SUCCESS IN MEDITATION ON IMPERMANENCE, AND ITS BENEFITS [V][05_toc-title.html#sec-16]This chapter has two parts: (1) signs of success in this meditation and (2) itsbenefits.Signs That Indicate Success in This Meditation [A]Reflecting on death, you see the destructibility of composite phenomena.Your diligence increases and you abandon pursuit of this life’s activity.You have not even an instant of leisure time to dwell in the mundane.Disillusionment and renunciation diminish your preoccupations.Reflecting on death day and night, you see that any appearance can be destroyedand a deep-seated detachment from outer events is born in you. An attitude thatburns like fire with diligence toward ennobling acts is born in you.Extraordinary, heartfelt fear and apprehension toward the round of rebirth’ssufferings are born in you. You give up pursuit of this life’s activities in theknowledge that at death they will be of no use to you whatsoever. You do notdwell for even an instant in mundane relaxation: you practice the sacredBuddhist doctrine in thought, word, and deed. You see acts’ ripened results:disillusionment and disengagement arise. When you understand the uncertainty ofthe time of death, you do not count on anything. These signs indicate that youhave sincerely familiarized yourself with death.When reflection on impermanence wells up in your stream of being,disillusionment with and mental disengagement from the phenomena of the round ofrebirth surge from the depths of your mind. This has the benefit of turning yourattention away from the events of this life. The way you turn away fromattachment is with the thought, “Nothing can help me: I am sure to die.”You feel as if you were caught by the son of a man you murdered; like a fishcaught in a net; like a condemned person delivered into the hands of theexecutioner; as if you had stepped into a nest of poisonous snakes; as if youhad entered an ogre’s mouth; as if you had arrived on an island of female ogres;as if you had slipped into a shark’s mouth; as if your ship had broken up atsea; as if your boat were sinking; as if in a terrifying place, your guideproved deceptive; as if you had fallen down a ravine from which escape wasimpossible; or as if you were shot in the heart with an arrow: you know thatnothing can help you and you let go of worldly activity. The Transmission of theMonastic Code of Conduct states:Compared to giving one hundred fully ordained persons their noon meal and anoffering, how much better it is to give a moment’s thought to the impermanenceof composite phenomena!The Benefits of Familiarization with Death and Impermanence [B]The benefits are abandonment of faulty behavior; the natural gathering ofqualities;Liberation from delusion, from desire and anger, and from attachment to thingsas permanent;Utmost diligence in ennobling acts; completion of stores of goodness and wisdom;and consideration by the victors:You die in happiness and quickly attain enlightenment.The infinite benefits of meditation on death include the following: many newqualities are born within your character; you turn away from belief inpermanence; you feel no attachment toward friends or anger toward enemies; youbecome constantly diligent in ennobling acts; you know that this life amounts toperceptions of delusion; you complete the two stores of goodness and wisdom;buddhas and bodhisattvas think of you; and you die joyful and happy. In yournext life, you take rebirth in the worlds of the pleasant higher realms; as soonas you are born there, you encounter the sacred Buddhist doctrine and spiritualmasters and guides; you will always be autonomous; you will become a renunciantwithin the Buddha’s doctrine; you will have the ability to maintain lifelongpure behavior; you will spend day and night in spiritual practice; you willbefriend holy persons; and you will quickly attain complete enlightenment. So itis said.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSThe round of rebirth’s phenomena pass with the fleetingness of lightning.Their nature is unreal and ever-changing.They cause every unwanted suffering.To fall under the power of foolish unconsciousness of impermanence is realtorment.At the time of death, you leave your home, your body, and every possession,To go into the Lord of Death’s frightful presence.At death, nothing but the Buddhist doctrine is of any use:The time has come for you to practice the true instructions for death.It’s surely impossible to remain living for long:What are all your long-range plans for?If you do nothing meaningful to prepare for the end of life coming soon,In no time at all, these appearances will cease and you will go to the nextlife.This concludes the commentary to “Reflection on Death and Impermanence,” Book 4of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work thatelucidates all ways of spiritual development. I, Longchen Choying Tobden Dorje,wrote this sincerely remembering that since all composite phenomena areimpermanent, I must quickly die, so I must foster energetic application toeverlasting goals.

A Brief Presentation of the Nature of Action, Karma, and Consequences2. The Extensive Explanation of Corrupting Acts and Their Consequences3. The Explanation of Ennobling Acts Consistent with Goodness and TheirConsequences4. A Concise Presentation of Acts Consistent with Freedom and Their ConsequencesThese four chapters contain a total of twelve headings.THE NATURE OF ACTION, KARMA, AND CONSEQUENCES [I] [05_toc-title.html#sec-17]Death is certain; therefore, the choice between ennobling acts and wrongdoing isour central issue.On the foundation of the storehouse of all dualistic experience, ignorance andits associated factors—The afflicted mind’s three poisons—produce the ten corrupting acts,Which result in the three miserable existences; and the ten ennobling acts,which result in birth as a god or human;And uncontaminated ennobling acts, which lead to the attainment of freedom.Death is certain; therefore, we must choose to undertake ennobling acts andreject wrongdoing.The foundation underlying both kinds of acts is the storehouse of all dualisticexperience, which has an undetermined nature (that is, neither positive nornegative). All our acts of all kinds occur supported by that foundation. Actsdone in ignorance and its associated factors—the afflicted mind’s three or fivepoisons—are the ten corrupting acts. Among acts done without those poisons’influence, inferior ennobling acts merely accord with goodness; sublimeennobling acts (the causes of separation from ignorance) lead to transcendentstates and accord with freedom; and acts of complete purity are manifestrealization on the spiritual path.Although their common ground, the storehouse of all dualistic experience, has noprimordial existence, it serves as the underlying foundation for the store ofthat which comes into being circumstantially. The Hundred Procedures states:How amazing! The world arises from karma!Karma designs happiness and suffering!When conditions gather, karma arises!Karma creates happiness and suffering!Further in the same text,Even after one hundred eons,Karma is not exhausted. When the conditions and the time meet,The fruit of karma ripensTo those embodied beings who created it.The Discourse of Individual Liberation states:These words the Buddha’s teaching span:Leave any wrongdoing behind;Make perfect ennobling acts yours;And subdue your own mind.The Concise Collection of Teachings on Awakening states:That which is free from the three aspects of mental afflictionsIs goodness and the acts that accord with freedom: keenly accomplish them.Due to the mind, due to karma, and due to their being causes consistent withbeings’ rebirths,Acts resemble the seeds of significant results.CORRUPTING ACTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-18]This chapter has five parts: (1) the ten corrupting acts of body, speech, andmind, (2) the consequences of ripened corrupting acts, (3) experience consistentwith corrupting karma, (4) acts consistent with corrupting karma, and (5) thepersonal or environmental consequences of corrupting acts.The Ten Corrupting Acts of Body, Speech, and Mind [A]Killing is the unmistaken, deliberate ending of another’s life;Striking, beating, or other acts that harm another’s well-being belong to thesame category.Taking what is not given is to steal another’s wealth;Gain through deceitful or dishonest means belongs to the same category.Wrong sexual conduct is to have intercourse with a partner claimed by another;Inappropriate sexual activity belongs to the same category.Lying is to confound truth and lies in order to deceive another;Manipulation with seeming honesty belongs to the same category.Divisive speech is to speak words that estrange persons in harmony or thosealready unfriendly;To incite animosity by speaking of another’s faults belongs to the samecategory.Meaningless speech is to talk of unsound treatises or gossip;To speak of irrelevant or materialistic topics belongs to the same category.Rough speech is to use words that hurt another’s feelings;To talk of things that cause others discomfort belongs to the same category.Covetousness is the wish to acquire another’s possessions;To be attached through desire to another’s wealth belongs to the same category.Ill will is mental agitation with malicious thoughts toward another;To not wish for another’s good fortune belongs to the same category.Wrong views are views of eternalism, nihilism, or of no relation between actionand consequence;To exaggerate or denigrate the correct teachings belongs to the same category.There are three physical corrupting acts. (1) Taking of life is the deliberatekilling of any form of life, an insect or greater. Striking, beating, and so onbelong to the same category. The Journey to Langka Discourse states:Mahamati! If my exalted hearers do not eat common food, how could it beappropriate for them to eat flesh and blood? Mahamati! I perceive all sentientbeings as my only child: how could I give permission to the hearers to eat mychildren’s flesh? Do I need to add that I myself could not eat it? Mahamati! Ihave never given such permission to the hearers or claimed that I eat such food.Further in the same text,To kill a sentient being for profitAnd to pay money for meat—These two persons’ karmaIs to be cooked in Crying Out or other hells.Further,I completely reproach eating meat.Further,In the future,Foolish meat eatersWill claim, “The buddhas taughtThat eating meat is not a sin and is appropriate.”Further,Meat is never pure in relation to three considerations—Not examined, not requested,And not ordered.Therefore, do not eat meat.(2) Taking what is not given is defined as stealing or robbing another’s wealth;gain through any dishonest means belongs to the same category.(3) Wrong sexual conduct is defined as sexual intercourse with a partner claimedby another, with a relative, with a woman who has taken celibacy vows, inanother opening, or at an unsuitable time or place; ejaculation by any othermeans apart from intercourse belongs to the same category.There are four corrupting acts of speech: (4) Lying is defined as to speaksomething untrue to change another’s perception; to speak honestly seeing thatthis will mislead another belongs to the same category.(5) Divisive speech is defined as words that estrange two other persons; torepeat to one friend divisive speech said by another belongs to the samecategory.(6) Meaningless speech is defined as talk of Vedas, poetry, and other suchsubjects, or various forms of jokes; to talk of irrelevant subjects indisharmony with Buddhism at inappropriate times belongs to the same category.(7) Rough speech is defined as use of words that are unpleasant to another’s earand that upset another’s mind; to talk of things that cause another discomfort,even if said pleasantly, belongs to the same category.There are three corrupting acts of the mind: (8) Covetousness is defined as thethought, “Why shouldn’t another’s possessions, and so on, be mine?”; angrythoughts toward another, “Why shouldn’t their education, and so on, be mine?”belong to the same category.(9) Ill will is defined as malicious thoughts toward another; to be angry orunhappy at what helps them belongs to the same category.(10) Wrong views are defined as criticism of belief in the relation betweenaction and consequence, and to fall into extremes of eternalism or nihilism; toexaggerate or denigrate that which is consistent with the sacred Buddhistdoctrine, such as correct instruction, and instructors, spiritual guides,belongs to the same category. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:Taking of life is the deliberate,Unmistaken killing of another being.Taking what is not givenIs to make another’s wealth your own by force or by stealth.Desire for intercourse that is inappropriateLeads to the four kinds of wrong sexual conduct.Lies change others’ perceptionsWhen they credit those false words and meaning.Divisive speech is words spoken under the influence of the mental afflictionsTo separate others.Rough speech is unpleasant speech.All words spoken under mental afflictions’ influence are meaningless speech.Misguided covetousness is to desire another’s wealth.Ill will is to hate another sentient being.The view that there are neither ennobling acts nor corrupting actsIs a wrong view.In the past, a fully ordained nun called others of the same order, “Bitch!” Eventhat minor fault of speech resulted in her rebirth five hundred times as afemale dog.The Consequences of Ripened Corrupting Acts [B]Corrupting acts produce four consequences:Ripened consequences, experience consistent with karma, acts consistent withkarma, and environmental consequences.Acts’ ripened fruits are these:Minor acts among the ten corrupting acts result in rebirth as an animal;Medium acts, as a starving spirit; and serious acts, as a hell being.Corrupting acts have four aspects: a corrupting object, a corrupting intent, acorrupting thought, and a corrupting deed. These produce four consequencesdetailed below: the ripened consequence, experience consistent with karma, thepersonal or environmental consequence, and acts consistent with your karma.The ripened consequence of corrupting acts functions as follows: engaging inminor acts among the ten corrupting acts results in rebirth as an animal; mediumacts, as a starving spirit; and serious acts, as a hell being. Entering theConduct of Bodhisattvas states:One moment of wrongdoingConfines us for an eon in the hell of Uninterrupted Torment.Therefore, do I need to say it? The wrongdoing we have accumulated in the roundof rebirth without beginningWill not propel us to pleasant realms!The Garland of Jewels states:Ennobling acts produce happinessAnd, likewise, every happy existence;Corrupting acts produce sufferingAnd, likewise, every miserable existence.The Mindfulness Discourse states:The ripening of these acts produces these consequences: minor corrupting actsresult in birth as an animal; medium acts, as a starving spirit; and seriousacts, as a hell being.Experience Consistent with Corrupting Karma [C]Experience consistent with corrupting karma is as follows: even if you attainrebirth in the higher existences,Killing results in a short life span and in many sicknesses that proveincurable.Taking what was not given results in poverty and in encountering many enemiesand thieves.Wrong sexual conduct results in an unattractive spouse and in many competitiveenemies.Lying results in slander and deceit.Divisive speech results in separation from friends and in general disharmony.Rough speech results in hearing many unpleasant things and in arguments.Meaningless speech results in lack of self-confidence and in not being believed.Covetousness results in not accomplishing your hopes and in lack of contentment.Ill will results in fearfulness and in often being harmed.Wrong views result in continued bad views and in often being deceived.Thus, each consequence of the ten corrupting acts has two aspects.The Hundred Procedures states:However, even if by chance you enter the realms of gods or humans, the effect ofkilling will make your life short and full of sickness. Taking what was notgiven results in separation from your possessions and destitution, and to haveto share your possessions with your enemies. Wrongful sexual conduct due todesire makes your spouse unattractive and to have to share him or her withothers. Telling lies makes you often the object of slander and of others’deceit. Divisive speech makes your social circle evil and fractious. Roughspeech makes your words unpleasant and argumentative. Meaningless speech makesyour words unworthy of consideration and you lack self-confidence. Covetousnessmakes your desires increase and makes you discontent. Ill will becomes the basisfor not searching for what could help but in accomplishing harm. Wrong viewsincrease your bad views and significant deception.Acts Consistent with Corrupting Karma [D]Acts consistent with the ten corrupting forms of karmaIncline a person to continue to do nowWhatever acts he or she did in the past and thus, naturally and effortlessly,To commit many evil deeds and to fall once again to miserable existences.The Hundred Procedures states:Familiarization and intimate acquaintance with corrupting conduct lead to laterrebirth in a life immersed in corrupting acts, corrupting conduct, and followingcorrupting tendencies.The Personal or Environmental Consequences of Corrupting Acts [E]Environmental consequences ripen in the place of birth:Taking another’s life results in birth in an unattractive regionWhere medicinal plants do not grow, the food and drink are not nutritious andhard to digest,And any sickness can be life-threatening.Taking what was not given results in birth where harvests do not ripen,Frost and hail are common, and famines occur.Wrong sexual conduct results in birth in a swampy area,In a region which is unhygienic and malodorous with feces and urine,And in a frightening and depressing place.Lying results in birth in a land of disharmony and changing fortunes,And in a deceptive region full of fear.Divisive speech results in birth in a land of ravines, steep cliffs, and deepgorges,Where travel is difficult, the land is very uneven,And both moving and settling down are inconvenient.Rough speech results in birth in a dusty, filthy land of bad crops,Where rocks, stunted tree trunks, thorns, salty ground, and other thingsMake the land disturbing and unpleasant.Meaningless speech results in birth in an unstable land where the seasons areunpredictable,And where harvests do not ripen.Covetousness results in birth in a land where fruit is sparse but barkplentiful,And where the place and time are evil.Ill will results in birth in a land where harm abounds:Bandits, thieves, snakes, poison, rulers’ punishments,Wild malicious animals, and hot-tasting fruit.Wrong views result in birth in a land without natural resources, such as jewels,Where flowers, fruit, and medicinal trees are rare,And where there is no security or powerful friends to provide sanctuary.I have written this clear presentation based upon Asanga’s Concise Definitions.The Discourse of Advice to the King states:Wherever people go,Their acts follow like shadows.ENNOBLING ACTS CONSISTENT WITH GOODNESS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES [III][05_toc-title.html#sec-19]This chapter has five parts: (1) the ten ennobling acts of body, speech, andmind; (2) the consequences of ripened ennobling acts; (3) experience consistentwith ennobling karma; (4) acts consistent with ennobling karma; and (5)environmental consequences of ennobling acts.The Ten Ennobling Acts of Body, Speech, and Mind [A]The path of ennobling acts has ten aspects:Having renounced killing, you ransom the lives of those sure to die.Not taking what was not given, you give gifts of material goods.Not engaging in wrongful sexual activity, you act purely.Not lying, you speak honestly.Not speaking divisively, you seek to reconcile discord between others.Not speaking nonsense, you talk about meaningful subjects.Not speaking roughly, you speak pleasantly.Not coveting, you are content.Untroubled by ill will, you develop an altruistic attitude.Having abandoned wrong views, you devote yourself to correct views.Acts of stillness are meditations of the four levels of meditative stabilityAnd the four formless realms.Thus, the ten ennobling acts of body, speech, and mind accord with goodness andare the causes for rebirth in the higher realms. Mental acts of stillness aremeditations on the four levels of meditative stability and the four formlessstates of composure. The Sublime Essence states:The gods’ ways of spiritual development—the four levels of meditative stabilityand the four formless states of composure—and human religions’ ten ennoblingacts provide the support for all excellent religious teachings.The Consequences of Ripened Ennobling Acts [B]The consequences of ripened ennobling acts are these:Ennobling acts tainted by jealousy and associated factors result in birth inregions of demigods;Minor accumulation of ten ennobling acts tainted by pride results in birth as ahuman being;Middle accumulation of such acts, among gods of the desire realm;Major accumulation of such acts, if done in conjunction with the four levels ofmeditative stability, among gods in the form realm.If the ten ennobling acts are performed in conjunction with the four levels offormless meditative stability, among gods in the formless realm.In the desire realm, karma principally manifests in the seven collections ofcoarse consciousness;In the form realm, in clarity without discursive thought, the storehouseconsciousness;In the formless realm, in tranquility that remains one-pointed within thestorehouse of all dualistic experience.The consequences of ripened ennobling acts are as follows: ennobling actstainted with the mental affliction of jealousy and its associated factors resultin birth in the demigods’ four regions. Minor accumulation of the ten ennoblingacts tainted with pride and its associated factors results in birth as a humanbeing on the four continents or their subcontinents; middle accumulation of theten acts, among gods of the six kinds of desire realm gods; major accumulationof the ten acts in conjunction with meditation on the four levels of meditativestability, in birth in the form realm. The ten ennobling acts performed inconjunction with meditation on the four levels of formless meditative stabilityresult in rebirth in the formless realm.In the desire realm, the main form of conscious experience is the sevencollections of consciousness: the six collections of sense-based consciousnessarisen in response to sensory fields plus coarse consciousness that has arisenfrom circumstances. In the form realm, the main form of conscious experience ismeditative stability within clarity without discursive thought. This dwellswithin the ongoing state of the storehouse consciousness itself. In the formlessrealm, the main form of conscious experience is the meditative state ofone-pointed tranquility. This dwells within the ongoing state of the storehouseof all dualistic experience, while the other aspects of consciousness exist aslatent potentials. The Bodhisattvas’ Stages of Awakening states:A state without thoughts, which is unrelated to sensory fields, is theexperiential context of the storehouse of all dualistic experience itself. Astate without thoughts, which is related to sensory fields, is the experientialcontext of the storehouse consciousness. Awareness of each sensory field is theexperiential context of the five sense-based aspects of consciousness. Theinitial arising of thoughts in relation to sensory fields, followed byexamination, creates dualistic experience—the experiential context of the mentalfunction’s consciousness and the afflicted mind.Experience Consistent with Ennobling Karma [C]Experience consistent with ennobling karma is as follows:Renunciation of killing results in long life, freedom from illness, andhappiness.Renunciation of taking what was not given results in attainment of magnificentpower and wealth.Renunciation of wrong sexual conduct results in an attractive partner and nocompetitive enemies.Renunciation of telling lies results in gaining others’ praise and respect.Renunciation of divisive speech results in being attractive in others’ sight.Renunciation of meaningless speech results in your words being credited astrustworthy.Renunciation of rough speech results in the increase of your favorable renown.Renunciation of covetousness results in accomplishment of all your goals.Renunciation of ill will results in being attractive and subduing others onsight.Renunciation of wrong views results in correct views arising in your mind.The Discourse That Presents the Ten Ennobling Acts states:Those inclined toward and diligent in these ten ennobling acts find theirsituations improve: their lives are long; their possessions increase; they livein harmony with their spouse and have no rivals; slander does not occur; theyare popular; their speech is esteemed; their speech is pleasant to everyone;they are content; they give and receive love; and they have excellent views.Acts Consistent With Ennobling Karma [D]The consequence of having practiced the ten ennobling acts in previous lifetimesIs turning away from corrupting acts in thought, word, and deed,And natural application to the ten ennobling acts.This leads to the attainment of excellent lifetimes among gods and humans.The consequence of having practiced the ten ennobling acts in previous series oflifetimes is, in the present life, you turn away from negative, corrupting actsin thought, word, and deed, and you are naturally compelled to engage in the tenennobling acts. Those acts lead to the attainment of excellent future lifetimesamong gods and humans. The Vast Enjoyment Discourse states:With enthusiasm for ennobling acts, your stores of goodness increase,And you fully sustain the excellent cultivation of awakening.The Environmental Consequences of Ennobling Acts [E]The environmental consequences of engaging in the ten ennobling acts are asfollows:Renunciation of killing results in birth in a pleasant land,Where medicine and grains are nutritious and life is secure.Renunciation of taking what was not given results in birth in a land whereharvests are abundantAnd wealth in food and riches increases.Renunciation of wrong sexual conduct results in birth in an attractive land,Which is clean, wide, and sweet-smelling.Renunciation of lying results in birth in a landWhere wealth lasts, which lives in harmony with its neighbors, and where thereis no deceit or fear.Renunciation of divisive speech results in birth in a landWhich is spacious, happy, and even; where both travel and settling down areeasy.Renunciation of meaningless speech results in birth in a landWhere the seasons are regular, where leaves, flowers, and fruit ripen on time.Renunciation of rough speech results in birth in a landWhere the land and fields are even, and which is adorned with lakes and pools.Renunciation of covetousness results in birth in a landWhere plentiful harvests of every desirable object multiply.Renunciation of ill will results in birth in a landWhere all inhabitants—humans and nonhumans—are not harmful, and which has everyconducive condition.Renunciation of wrong views results in birth in a magnificent land,Which has jewel mines, security, and powerful allies.As explained, corrupting acts create suffering and rebirth in the threemiserable existences; ennobling acts, happiness and the higher existences.Therefore, to attain the uplifted happiness of the gods’ and human realms, youmust apply yourself to ennobling acts. The Mindfulness Discourse states:Whatever appears in any worldHas arisen directly from your own karma.ACTS CONSISTENT WITH FREEDOM AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES [IV][05_toc-title.html#sec-20]This chapter has two parts: (1) acts consistent with freedom and (2) resultsconsistent with freedom.Acts Consistent with Freedom [A]To gain freedom from the sufferings of existence,Enter the way of the hearers, solitary sages, or bodhisattvas,Then strive day and night at ennobling acts,Epitomized by awakening’s thirty-seven facets,The four immeasurable aspirations, and the six transcendent perfections.Ennobling acts of body, speech, and mind such as theseSealed with dedication to enlightenment are called “acts consistent withfreedom.”To gain freedom from every suffering of unbearable existence, enter the way ofthe hearers, solitary sages, or bodhisattvas, then strive day and night atennobling acts within your chosen path, synthesized as awakening’s thirty-sevenfacets; or, in the great way, by the four immeasurable aspirations and the sixtranscendent perfections. Such ennobling acts of body, speech, and mind, sealedwith dedication to enlightenment, are called “acts consistent with freedom.”Results Consistent with Freedom [B]Physical, verbal, and mental ennobling acts guided by the skillful means andsublime insightOf the three Buddhist ways constitute actsThat result in the temporary attainment of life as a god or human and in theultimate attainmentOf the hearers’ or solitary sages’ awakening or of supreme awakening.Accumulation of physical, verbal, and mental ennobling acts, guided by thespecial skillful means of each of the three Buddhist ways and by sublimeinsight, emptiness, constitute acts that result in the temporary attainment ofgods’ or human beings’ wealth, glory, and excellent incarnation; and in theultimate attainment of the hearers’ or solitary sages’ awakening, or of supremeawakening—the holy exalted state of unsurpassable enlightenment. These subjectswill be clearly presented in detail below, in chapters that describe thediscourses’ and tantras’ foundation, path, and result.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSEvil acts created by the five poisonsResemble enjoyment of poisoned food.The fruit of what has grown from poisonous seedsIs certain to produce only poison-like consequences: suffering.The sacred nectar of ennobling acts,Beneficial for yourself and others, is the nectar of fully positive acts.Those fortunate enough to drink the Buddhist teachings’ nectarWill attain the supreme exalted state of everlasting nectar.Suffering arises from evil wrongdoing;Those who want to avoid suffering renounce such acts.Happiness results from ennobling acts;Those who wish for happiness apply themselves in thought, word, and deed toennobling acts.This concludes a commentary to “The Workings of Karma,” Book 5 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all ways ofspiritual development. I, Longchen Choying Tobden Dorje, wrote this to fosterunderstanding that since ennobling acts surely result in happiness andwrongdoing in suffering, those who wish every happiness should always applythemselves to ennobling acts, and since no one wishes to suffer, we should nevercommit wrongdoing.

The Suffering from Heat and Cold in the Hells2. The Suffering from Hunger and Thirst among Starving Spirits 3. The Sufferingof Beasts of Burden in the Animal Realm4. The Suffering from Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death in the Human Realm5. The Suffering from Conflict in the Demigods’ Realm6. The Suffering from Death and Falling in the Realm of the GodsThese six chapters contain a total of twenty-eight headings.THE SUFFERING FROM HEAT AND COLD IN THE HELLS [I] [05_toc-title.html#sec-21]As described, action and consequences function precisely and subtly. Thischapter has four parts: (1) the eight hot hells and the differences in theirfires’ heat, (2) the eight cold hells, (3) the neighboring hells, and (4) theoccasional hells.The Eight Hot Hells and the Differences in Their Fires’ Heat [A]This section has nine parts: (1) Reviving Hell, (2) Black Line Hell, (3)Crushing Hell, (4) Wailing Hell, (5) Great Screaming Hell, (6) Hot Hell, (7)Extremely Hot Hell, (8) the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, and (9) thedifferences in the heat of the fires of hell.Reviving Hell [1]As described, action and consequences function precisely and subtly.Therefore, many evil acts motivated by the power of angerResult in the hells’ excruciating suffering.Among these, in Reviving Hell, beings take miraculous birth on a ground of hotiron,On seeing one another, they become uncontrollably enraged, and strike oneanother with sharp weapons.Once dead, a sound revives them, and they reexperience the same torment.Their duration of life is calculated as follows:Fifty human years equal a day for the gods of the four great divine kings.Thirty such days equal a month; twelve months, one year.Five hundred of such years equal one day in Reviving Hell.Beings in this hell live five hundred of their own years:Thus, they suffer for a totalOf one trillion, six hundred and twenty billion human years.In Reviving Hell, the force of previous acts assembles hell beings on a groundof blazing iron embers. They strike one another with such weapons as clubs,axes, spears, and wheels. When they spy their sworn enemy, they act as ifderanged and finally everyone dies. A voice from the sky exclaims, “Come to lifeagain!” and the beings immediately revive as before. They must experience thesuffering of being killed by weapons day and night, countless times. Letter froma Spiritual Friend states:In this world, the suffering of being fiercely beatenBy three hundred clubs during one dayCannot compare, even in part,To a minor suffering in hell.Life there lasts until the being’s karma is spent. In the great way’s commondiscourses and treatises, it is said that beings migrate from the hellsaccording to the seriousness of their karma; thus, these texts do not specifydefinite life spans for beings reborn there. It is said that beings can leavehell if a forceful remedy to a particular act has arisen in their stream ofbeing, or conversely, that such acts as contempt toward the vajra master canrequire beings to remain in hell for many great eons. Therefore, the length oflife in hell depends on the karmic obscuration which caused that rebirth. Letterfrom a Spiritual Friend states:Such totally intolerable sufferingCan be experienced for billions of years;Yet until the karma of that corrupting act is spent,You cannot be free from that life.According to the common Buddhist perspective, the duration of life in this hellis stated in The Treasury of Observed Phenomena:It is said that a single day in Reviving Hell and the other six hells, instages,Equals the longevity of a specific class of the desire realm’s gods.If the calculation of longevity in this hell is based upon The MindfulnessDiscourse and Discernment of Karma, fifty human years equal a day for the godsamong the four great divine kings; thirty such days equal one month; twelvemonths, one year. Five hundred such years equal one day in Reviving. Beingsthere live for five hundred of their own years. In human terms, fifty humanyears equal a day for the gods of the four great divine kings; one thousand,five hundred human years equal one of their months; eighteen thousand, one year;nine million years, the life span of those gods. Nine million human years equalone day in Reviving; two hundred and seventy million human years, one month;thirty billion, two hundred and forty million human years, one year; onetrillion, six hundred and twenty billion human years, the life span of beings inthis hell.9 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st9] The Mindfulness Discourse states:In human years, sentient beings in the Reviving Hell live for one hundredthousand times ten million years, plus sixty-two thousand ten millions.Further in the same text,Human beings who have killed other humansOr killed humans in fetal developmentWill definitely be reborn in Reviving Hell.Why is it called Reviving?For many thousands of years,Beings are struck and beaten, then revived.Thus it is called “Reviving.”Black Line Hell [2]Below, in Black Line Hell, beings are sliced up by saws, then rejoined, andagain cut and rejoined:Their sufferings are immeasurable.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: one hundred human years equalone day for the gods in Heaven of the Thirty-Three;One thousand of their years equal one day in Black Line Hell;Beings in that hell live one thousand of their own years.In human terms, this equals three trillion, two hundred and forty billion yearsOf enduring suffering from being cut and sliced up.Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:Some are sliced up by saws;Others, by axes’ unbearably sharp blades.In Black Line Hell, eight or sixteen lines are drawn on beings’ bodies, thensharp saws slice along those lines from the crown of their heads; then theirbodies are rejoined, and again cut. They experience this for a thousand of theirown years.Eighteen million human years equal one day in Black Line Hell. The beings’ lifespan there equals, in human terms, three trillion, two hundred and forty billionyears. The Mindfulness Discourse states:Persons who have insulted,Slandered, or lied toTheir parents, companions, relatives, or spiritual guides,Will be reborn in Black Line Hell.Why is it called that?Black lines are drawnThen saws and flames slice along them.Thus, it is called “Black Line.”Crushing Hell [3]Below, in Crushing Hell, the mountains are shapedLike heads of tigers, lions, horses, or camels.Beings are pulverized to dust between these; the mountains separate, and thebeings return to life.In a region of iron, hammers beat them to powder;They are pressed so their blood flows in great streams.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: two hundred human years equalone day in the Heaven of Twins;Two thousand years there equal one day in Crushing Hell;Beings in this hell live two thousand years,Equal in human terms to six trillion, four hundred and eighty billion yearsOf torment due to unbearable karma.Letter to a Disciple states:A pair of fearsome long sheep horns, the size of mountains,Meet, crushing to powder all bodies in the valley between them.A slight cool breeze rises, restores the beings to life,Then the process is repeated a hundred times, reducing them to powder.Advice from a Spiritual Friend states:Some are squeezed like sesame;Others are pulverized, ground like fine flour.In Crushing Hell, iron mountains are shaped like heads of tigers, lions, goats,or sheep. Beings suffer for two thousand of their own years, pulverized to dustbetween these; then they return to life and are again crushed.Thirty-six million human years equal one day in Crushing Hell. Thus, in humanterms, their lives last for six trillion, four hundred and eighty billion years.A previous text [The Mindfulness Discourse] states:Those who killed living beings,Such as a goat, sheep, fox, or pig,Rabbit, mouse, or wild boar,Go to the Gathering and Crushing Hell.Why is it called this? Flung where things gather,Beings are killed.Thus, it is called “Crushing Hell.”Wailing Hell [4]Below, in Wailing Hell, beings are burned in blazing fires and cooked in molteniron:They cry out in agony.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: four hundred human years equalone day in Joyful Heaven.Four thousand years there equal one day in Wailing Hell;Beings in this hell live four thousand of their own years,Equal in human termsTo twelve trillion, nine hundred and sixty billion years.Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:Some, on a pyre of red-hot cinders,Are continually burned, their mouths open wide in screams.Some, in huge caldrons of molten lead,Are cooked head-down, like handfuls of grain.Letter to a Disciple states:Some fall into great cauldrons of boiling oil.Others step onto ground of burning sand from which flames rise:They can’t find a place to put their feet.In Wailing Hell, beings suffer from burning in blazing fires and being cooked inmolten iron; they scream loudly in agony. Beings in this hell live four thousandof their own years. One day in Wailing equals seventy-two million human years;in human terms their lives last twelve trillion, nine hundred and sixty billionyears. A previous text [The Mindfulness Discourse] states:Here, embodied beingsUnder the influence of physical, verbal, or mental afflictionsWho slander or deceive othersGo to Wailing Hell.There, burnedContinually in ferocious fires,Beings cry out fiercely.Thus, it is called “Wailing Hell.”Great Screaming Hell [5]Below, in Great Screaming Hell, in iron buildings,Beings are burnt in blazing fires: a great screaming resounds.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: eight hundred human years equalone day in Heaven of Joy in Creation.Eight thousand years there equal one day in Great Screaming Hell.Beings in this hell live eight thousand of their own years,Equal in human terms to twenty-five trillion, nine hundred and twenty billionyears.Letter to a Disciple states:Hell fires and reeking smoke change the sky’s color.Many tongues of flames diffuse, covering the whole surroundings.Numb with fear, hell beings see guards with garlands of small white bones,Wearing elephant skins and making threatening gestures. Hell beings cry inanguish.In some places, the flames grow stronger and make thundering sounds.Fat falls from beings’ bodies, making some crackling sounds at the flames’ tips.Hissing rises from the ashes in the beings’ rib cages.They have fallen into fires of an intensity unknown even at the end of time.In Great Screaming Hell, in closed iron buildings, beings are burnt in blazingfires for eight thousand of their own years. One day in Great Screaming equalsone hundred and forty-four million human years. Their lifetime lasts fortwenty-five trillion, nine hundred and twenty billion human years. A previoustext [The Mindfulness Discourse] states:Those who cause suffering by stealing the possessionsOf gods, brahmins, or spiritual masters,Or who steal something entrusted to them,Go to Great Screaming Hell.Because beings there are burnt in fierce flames,Their cries are intenseAnd their karma is serious and strong,It is called “Great Screaming.”Hot Hell [6]Below, in Hot Hell, beings enter blazing iron buildings,Where they are beaten by hammers and pierced by spears.Their duration of life is calculated as follows:One thousand, six hundred human years equal one day in Heaven of Control ofOthers’ Creations.Sixteen thousand years there equal one day in Hot Hell.Hell beings there live sixteen thousand of their own years,Equal in human termsTo fifty-one trillion, eight hundred and forty billion years of the experienceof suffering.Letter to a Disciple states:A monstrous snake with a raised head,Like the fateful noose in the Lord of Death’s hand, tightly binds the livingbeings,While hawks, white kangka herons, and vulturesFearlessly pluck out their eyes and brains.In Hot Hell, in iron buildings, hammers fiercely beat hell beings and spearssplit their heads. Blazing fires burn them inside and out. This suffering lastsfor sixteen thousand of their years. One day in Hot Hell equals two hundred andeighty-eight million human years. Their life span lasts for fifty-one trillion,eight hundred and forty billion human years.Extremely Hot Hell [7]Below, in Extremely Hot Hell, in two-storied iron buildings,Beings are pierced by a three-pronged spear that protrudes from the head and thetwo shoulders,Then placed on a flat slab of blazing iron and cooked in molten copper.Life there lasts half an eon,A time incalculable in human years.The Mindfulness Discourse states:Those in Extremely Hot Hell must endure the torment of the sensations ofsuffering during half an intermediate eon.Another discourse states:This hell’s harmful things blaze fiercely: it is called Extremely Hot.Three-pointed spears and vajras pierce hell beings’ bodies.They are cooked in molten copper, and placed on a slab.Fire burns them inside and out—this is just a pause.In Extremely Hot Hell, in two-storied iron buildings, beings are pierced by athree-pronged spear, placed on a flat slab of blazing iron, and cooked in moltencopper. Their experience of suffering lasts half an eon.The Hell of Uninterrupted Torment [8]Below, in the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, in blazing iron buildings,No difference can be perceived between sentient beings and fire,Apart from hell beings’ anguished cries.They are consumed like a lamp’s wick.Life there lasts for an intermediate eon.Since no greater suffering exists,This hell is known as Torment Without Respite or Interruption.Letter to a Disciple states:At their hearts, their lungs ignite in fire like dry grass.Flames leave their throats and mouths; smoke flows out in streams.Their bellies open and their inner organs pour out:The hell beings’ alarm makes them utter loud, incomprehensible cries. Then theycease.They wish to become free from this enormous suffering.Through an open door, they repeatedly see others at a distance and they watchfor a chance to escape.When it comes, the karmic door closes tightly, cutting off that chance.At that time, other dismal, intolerable sufferings occur.A great cluster of large, sharp arrows falls on them,Then hell guardians beat them with clubs.As their tears flow, liquid molten lead falls with garlands of flames.Smoke billows from the openings of their mouths, nostrils, and ears.Liquid matter oozes from their eyes and brains; they are horrified.Dark masses of blazing tongues of fire rise from their skulls.The fire, as if in anger, spreads through their bodiesAs if burning a heap of dry firewood.Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:Similarly, among all sufferings,The Hell of Uninterrupted Torment’s sufferings are the most intolerable.Discernment of Karma states:At the gates of Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, there stands an iron mountainsixty thousand leagues wide. When hell beings have destroyed it and it exists nolonger, they leave that existence for another: thus, their life span isinfinite.It seems that these beings committed especially serious acts, such as abandoningthe teachings or violating the tantric bonds. The Mindfulness Discourse states:Those in Hell of Uninterrupted Torment leave that life after an intermediateeon. Even if they are born a human being, their senses will be impaired, and soon.The Differences in the Heat of the Fires of Hell [9]The differences in the heat of the hells’ fires are this:Each is seven times more intense than the one above.Each hell’s fire is seven times more intense than the last: each fire isprogressively hotter and the beings’ sufferings more extreme. Discernment ofKarma states:Like the progression from an ordinary fire of sandalwoodTo that of the fire at the end of time,The hell fires are progressively seven times hotterAnd cause seven times more suffering.The Eight Cold Hells [B]The eight cold hells are located in layers directly above the eight hot hells.In their dark expanse, raging snowstorms swirlIn icy enclosures that are extremely cold.In descending order, they are Blistering, Blister Bursting,Teeth Chattering, Sneezing Achoo, Sneezing Kerchoo,Splitting like a Water Lily, Splitting like a Lotus,And Splitting like a Large Lotus.Inside the hell beings’ open wounds live various sharp-toothed insects that gnawinto their flesh.Their duration of life is calculated as follows:If one hundred bags of sesame seeds are emptied at the rate of one grain eachhundred years, this equals the life of a being in Blistering.Longevity in each hell is double that of the preceding one.These are located in layers directly above the eight hot hells. In their darkexpanse, raging snowstorms swirl.In the eight very cold hells, beings are driven by blizzards of ice and snow.Among them, in the hell named Blistering, the extreme cold makes blisters formthat are the size of the top of the thumb. When the cold is sufficient to causethese to burst, this marks Blister Bursting Hell. When the cold provokessneezing, Sneezing Achoo. When beings make no sound besides sneezing, SneezingKerchoo. When beings are too cold to make any sound whatsoever, TeethChattering. When their bodies split into six pieces, Splitting like a WaterLily; when they split into eight pieces, Splitting like a Lotus; and when theysplit into sixteen, thirty-two, one hundred, or a thousand pieces, Splittinglike a Large Lotus.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: If eighty or one hundred fullbags of Kosala sesame seeds are emptied at the rate of one grain each hundredyears, the emptying of the load equals the life span of a being in BlisteringHell. The length of life in each hell below is double that of the preceding one:thus, longevity in Blistering Hell equals one such bag; Blister Bursting, two;Sneezing Achoo, four; Sneezing Kerchoo, eight; Teeth Chattering, sixteen;Splitting like a Water Lily, thirty-two; Splitting like a Lotus, sixty-four; andSplitting like a Large Lotus, one hundred and twenty-eight. The Treasury ofObserved Phenomena states:If each hundred years, one sesame seedIs taken from a bag of sesame,The emptying of the load equals the duration of life in Blistering Hell.Other cold hells last twenty times more.The Neighboring Hells [C]The neighboring hells are located around the eight hot hells or around the Hellof Uninterrupted Torment.Four lie in each of the four directions, sixteen in all:Fire Pit, Swamp of Corpses, Plain of Weapons,And River Without Ford.In Fire Pit, beings find a good trench where they can hide, but when they enterit, it becomes a pit of coalsWhere they experience the suffering of their flesh and bones being burned.In Swamp of Corpses, they see a cool swamp but when they enter it, it becomes aswamp of corpses,Where stinking worms with sharp iron and copper beaks eat them.In Plain of Weapons, they see a pleasant plain but when they go there,Many extremely sharp razors slice them to pieces.When they go to an attractive forest, it becomes a forest of swords—The wind moves the swords, which fall, cutting them.They see their previous homeland at the top of a mountain, but as they go towardit,Sharp iron spikes cut them so they bleed.At the top, vultures pluck out their brains, eyes, and fat.Then they think they hear a summons from the bottom of the hill—During their descent, the spikes turn upward and they are again tormented bybeing pierced.At the bottom, they are embraced by sharp-toothed men or women,Burned, and then eaten by dogs and wolves.In River Without Ford, they see a river, but on entering it, they sink up totheir necksIn hot ash, burning their flesh and bones.On the banks they see fearsome death demons who prevent them from leaving.In these hells, suffering is experienced for many thousands of years.Letter to a Disciple states:Massive dogs with many locks of hair matted togetherAnd long teeth with vajra points viciously attack their bodies.The River Without Ford’s banks are filled with flames, liquid ash,And rocks with sharp edges and piercing points.Further in the same text:Some experience the suffering of a mass of wriggling, tiny insectsThat bite into their bodies, making them rot and decompose.Those caught by these sensations in the snare made by karmaCannot even move and are killed.Further in the same text:Filled with sharp razors, the willow forest has branches of swords.Running exhausted within the forest, beings’ bodies are defenseless from wounds.They fall into a well filled with sharp tridents, clubs, arrows, and swords—The Lord of Death’s vicious mouth.Further in the same text:Tormented by the fierce sun, with pitiful bodies overcome by unbearablesuffering,They see and go toward a thick forest of green-leafed trees.Once there, the leaves become hundreds of weapons that fall, besetting theirbodies.There, for a long time, except for screams, they have no companions.Further in the same text:When beings quickly climb up the unbearably high hell-tree,Its thorns turn downward, and pass through the beings’ skin.In intense pain, their insides are mangled and disappear into the thorns.Further in the same text:When they descend, iron thorns turn upward—Many rough, sharp points pierce their bodies, and they faint.There, three-pointed, blazing spears assail them,Wracking their bodies with pain, making descent impossible.Then, ravens with sharp weapon-beaksPull at everything and extract their guts and intestines, which protrude andscatter.Some beings fall over terrifyingly high cliffs.Further in the same text:Fires of hundreds of flames leave the female hell guardians’ bodies.They wear such jewelry as intersecting garlands of flames.Their bodies, jagged as saws, are heedless of mercy:They savagely clutch the hell beings.The Mindfulness Discourse states:After they go there, they perceive a river. As they cross it, they are burned upto their necks. Even their bones crack and split apart. When they revive, theysee on the riverbanks the appearance of the former, imposing death demons, whoprevent them from leaving.The Occasional Hells [D]Occasional hells are located in various places—On mountains, in forests, between rocks, in fire or water, or at the edge of thecontinents.Beings can be few, many, or alone, and so on;Each is oppressed by suffering appropriate to their karma.The occasional hells are located in various different places, such as onmountains, on rocks, in fire or water, or at the edge of the continents. Hellbeings can have various different forms, like a pestle, a rope, a broom, splitwood, or a tree stump. They can live together or alone, as appropriate. Eachsuffers—such as from heat, cold, hunger, thirst, being split apart, cut, orcooked—in ways corresponding to their previous karma. Their intolerablesufferings can last half a day, an instant, or be continual, according to thepower of each being’s specific karma. Thus, these states are called “occasional”hells. The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:Then Maudgalyayana said, “I’ve gone to the ends of the oceans and seen inoccasional hells beings who resemble a pestle, a broom, or a tree. They are verynumerous and are tormented by suffering.” He concluded with,There is no happiness in existence.As in these occasional hells,All beings are tormented by their own sufferings,As if they lived circled by masses of flames.THE SUFFERING FROM HUNGER AND THIRST AMONG STARVING SPIRITS [II][05_toc-title.html#sec-22]This chapter has two parts: (1) starving spirits who live in specific locationsand (2) starving spirits who fly through space.Starving Spirits Who Live in Specific Locations [A]A moderate number of evil acts motivated by desire and greed results in birth asa starving spirit.Starving spirits obscured in relation to outer phenomena see any of fourmistaken perceptions:Those who mistakenly perceive mountains see a cool forest, but on going there,The forest burns and falling pieces of wood scorch them.Those who mistakenly perceive rivers see a stream, but on going there,The wind blows hot sand: the place becomes a plain of agony.Those who mistakenly perceive rain clouds see a cloud from which a rain of ironarrowsFalls like bolts of lightning with fire-arrows and smoke, cutting them.Those who mistakenly perceive temperature feel snowstorms hot when heatthreatens them,And fire cold when cold threatens.Those obscured in relation to physical perceptions have a mouth the size of theeye of a needle,A belly the size of a province, and arms and legs the size of blades of grass.When they eat a little, a fire burns inside,Scorches their inner organs, and sends smoke billowing out their mouths.Those who have general obscurations are obsessed with food and drinkBut see others aggressively guarding the food.A moderate number of evil acts motivated by desire and greed results in birth asa starving spirit.Among starving spirits, those obscured in relation to outer phenomena experiencethe suffering of mistaken perceptions. Those obscured in relation to physicalperceptions have mouths the size of the eye of a needle, bellies the size of aprovince, and arms and legs the size of blades of grass. When they eat a little,a fire burns inside them, scorches their inner organs, and sends smoke andflames billowing out their mouths. Those with general obscurations haveintolerable hunger due to desire for food and drink, but do not even hear ofwater for twelve years. Yet, when they see some water it dries up, or it seemsprotected, and they are prevented from drinking.If a mendicant or brahmin expels mucus or impurities and dedicates this to thesespirits with a mantra, some of these dedicated substances might arrive to theirmouths but first not enter. Once the starving spirits swallow, it makes themsuffer, as if a fire burned inside them. Even if they drink from a large lake,the water doesn’t reach their throats; their mouths become dry with heat. Apartfrom these and other sufferings, which are limitless, they experienceconsiderable physical and mental distress due to others’ harm. Letter to aDisciple states:Those with mouths the size of needles have a fearsome belly, many leagues wide.In their exhaustion, even if they were to drink from a great ocean,The water would not pass the wide cavern of their throats—Their mouths’ poison even dries water!Starving Spirits Who Fly through Space [B]Starving spirits who fly through space include ruler demons,Noxious spirits, ogres, tsen spirits, and demons.They fly unhindered through the power of their miraculous karma.They cause diseases, steal radiant well-being, obstruct vitality,And perform various kinds of harmful acts.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: one human month is a day forthe starving spirits.They live five hundred of their own years: in human terms, fifteen thousandyears,During which they experience suffering corresponding to their previous acts.Starving spirits who fly through space include ruler demons, noxious spirits,ogres, tsen spirits, and demons. They fly unhindered through the power of theirmiraculous karma.Since these beings belong to the class of starving spirits, they experienceunlimited suffering. Their homeland is unattractive, harmful, frightening, andafflicted with hunger and thirst. When these spirits feel attracted toindividuals, they approach and infect those individuals with the same fatalillness that killed them in the past. The same sickness forever torments themand they spread it to others. They steal others’ longevity and radiantwell-being, and thereby only cause others palpable harm and immediateexperiences of unhappiness.They are able to travel through miraculous powers, but they perceive guardiansblocking their way. They have various forms, such as a door, saw, firebrand,dog, or bird. Due to past, faint ennobling acts, some own possessions but aretormented by many other sufferings. For most of them, the seasons aredisordered. Others’ happiness causes them suffering; such miseries are infinite.The life span of starving spirits is calculated as follows: one human month is aday for the starving spirits; they live five hundred of their own years. Inhuman terms, this equals fifteen thousand years. The Essence of the SunDiscourse states:Large starving spirits’ bodies measure one thousand leagues wide; the smallest,a thumb’s length.The Short Discourse on Mindfulness states:Those who harm the immature (that is, sentient beings)Or whose craving leads them to cheat anotherWill be born “rotten body spirits”Who eat feces inside the body.Those who cause harm,Overthrow towns, and mine the earth for its treasureWill take birthAs an ugly ghoul to whom offerings can be made.Those who always enjoy smells and garlands,Who give songs and dance, and have little wrath,Will be born as celestial musiciansWho please the gods.Those who commit great slander,Are angry, and force laughterWill be reborn as ugly-faced,Wild, meat-eating spirits.Those who are always very hateful and busily preoccupied,And who like to make gifts,Will be born after death as spirits.Human beings who are wild and angry, but generous,And who enjoy delicious alcohol,Will be born after death as wild noxious spiritsWho enjoy alcohol.Those who offer themselves as any conveyance wished forBy parents or spiritual masters,Will be reborn as happy noxious spirits,With those acts the cause of their celestial palaces.After death, the faults of craving and greedLead to rebirth as these kinds of starving spirits.THE SUFFERING AMONG BEASTS OF BURDEN [III] [05_toc-title.html#sec-23]A small number of corrupting acts motivated by stupidity results in birth as ananimal.Submerged in the depths of oceans between the continents,Dolphins, fish, crustaceans, and other such wealth of the nagas—Animals of various shapes and sizes—Live crowded together like the fermented grains left after beer has been brewed.The large eat the small; the small pierce the large.At such dark places as the sides of the iron mountains at the far reaches of theworld-system,Animals experience the limitless suffering of being eaten by one another.Species scattered among the five other realms of existence—Such as birds, deer, wild animals, horses, cattle, and sheep—Are made beasts of burden or are slaughtered for their meat, skin, or bones.Hot sand and fear of garudas torment nagas.The animals who live the longest live for an eon; the shortest, for a day.Life span is uncertain and varied.A small number of evil acts motivated by stupidity results in birth as ananimal. Submerged in the depths of the vast oceans between the four continents,animals live crowded together, like fermented grains left after beer has beenbrewed. The large eat the small; the small pierce the large. Such sufferings areboundless. In such dark places as the sides of the outer iron mountain range orbetween those mountains, at the far reaches of our world-system, limitlesssuffering torments infinite numbers of animals.Various species of animals, such as birds, deer, wild animals, horses, cattle,and sheep, live scattered among the five other realms of existence, includingthe gods’ realms and the human realm. Animals owned by other beings suffer frombeing made beasts of burden or slaughtered in various ways for their meat, skin,or bones. Their sufferings are immeasurable.Nagas can experience happiness at any time of the day or night, but can alsofall prey at any time to many sufferings from heat, cold, hunger, or thirst.Rains of hot sand on their homes torment some; some don’t enter a group and mustlive alone. In general, they suffer from stupidity, fear of garudas, fear offorceful mantras, and countless forms of harm.Animals’ life span is not determined: some live for just an instant; some for aday, and so on; some, such as the naga king Takshaka, live for an intermediateeon. Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:In animals’ birthplaces, they undergo myriad sufferings,Such as being killed, bound, or beaten.Those who have spurned ennobling acts that foster peaceExperience the unbearable suffering of being eaten by one another.Some die for their pearls, wool, bones,Blood, meat, or skin.Powerless, they are enslaved, beaten with others’ whips,Hands, iron, or hooks.THE SUFFERING FROM BIRTH, AGING, SICKNESS, AND DEATH AMONG HUMANS [IV][05_toc-title.html#sec-24]This chapter has two parts: (1) principal sufferings and (2) secondarysufferings.Principal Sufferings [A]A small number of ennobling acts motivated by pride and attachmentResults in birth as a human of the four continents.Humans of all four continents, and particularly those of this world, Land ofJambu,Experience torment by three principal and eight secondary sufferings.The three principal sufferings are suffering heaped upon suffering:For example, when assailed by enemies, to fall ill.The suffering of change: for example, after suffering from hunger, to be unableto digest food.The suffering of the composite: for example, to act corruptly to acquire food orclothing;Or afflictive poisons that lead to committing the causes of suffering.A small number of ennobling acts motivated by pride and attachment results inbirth as a human of the four continents. Humans of all four continents, andparticularly those of this world, Land of Jambu, experience torment by threeprincipal and eight secondary sufferings.Humans have three principal sufferings: (1) suffering heaped upon suffering: forexample, when assailed by savage enemies, to fall seriously ill. (2) Thesuffering of change: for example, after being tormented by the suffering ofhunger and thirst, to be unable to digest food. (3) The suffering of thecomposite: for example, to eat poisoned food, to wear demon-infested clothing,or to act in ways that produce suffering’s causes, such as eating poison. TheTransmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:The round of rebirth’s aggregation of sufferingHas the suffering of suffering, of the composite, and of change:Due to these three and eight other sufferings,Human beings suffer greatly.Secondary Sufferings [B]This section has eight parts: (1) the suffering of birth, (2) the suffering ofaging, (3) the suffering of sickness, (4) the suffering of death, (5) thesuffering of meeting hated enemies, (6) the suffering of separation from lovedones, (7) the suffering of poverty and destitution, and (8) the suffering ofcontamination.The Suffering of Birth [1]In the womb, energy, mind, semen, and ovum conjoin:The fetus grows and develops for nine months and ten days,During which time it experiences the sufferings of being crampedin a dark, nauseating place.When the mother eats, the fetus feels as if crushed under a mountain;When she moves, as if falling down a precipice.When karma turns the child’s head and backsides around at birth,The child experiences suffering like that of the Crushing Hell.In the womb, a future child’s energy and mind, and the parents’ semen and ovumconjoin: the human fetus grows and develops for nine months and ten days, duringwhich time it experiences the suffering of being cramped in the dark andconfined in a tight, nauseating place. When the mother eats, it feels as ifcrushed under a mountain; when she moves or sits, as if falling down aprecipice; when she drinks something hot, as if falling into fire; when shedrinks something cold, as if falling into water. When the karmic circulatingenergy turns the child’s head and backsides around at birth, it is squeezedbetween her bones; the suffering is like that in the Crushing Hell. At birth,when touched by others, a newborn feels as if its skin is being peeled off; whenwashed, as if cut by razors. In these and other ways, the sufferings of birthare boundless.The Suffering of Aging [2]During the suffering of aging, the complexion fades, hair turns white,Teeth fall out, eyes weaken, warmth grows faint, digestive strength isexhausted,Memory fades, and you walk, sit, or move with difficulty.The tongue cannot taste distinct flavors, sounds are unheard,Faults multiply, qualities diminish: everybody disdains you.During the suffering of aging, flesh disappears, bones protrude, and thecomplexion fades. Hair turns white, teeth fall out, eyes weaken and are unclear,the body’s warmth grows faint, digestive strength is exhausted, and memoryfades. You are unable to walk, sit, or move much. The tongue loses its functionand cannot taste flavors, and sounds are unheard or misunderstood. Faults, suchas the five poisons, multiply; and your store of positive qualities diminishes:everybody disdains you. These and other sufferings are incalculable. Letter to aDisciple states:Then the Lord of Death grasps the elderly’s hand;It is impossible to let go.White hair spreads;The teeth fall out together, as in a smile.Then the joints separate.Your intellect becomes spoiled, walking deteriorates:Your body slowly disintegrates.Only wrongdoing is sure to increase.The senses gradually fade.Although your attachment to objects continues, your power to enjoy themdeteriorates.For a time, your state in this human realmWould be frightful even in hell.The Suffering of Sickness [3]During the suffering of sickness, this healthy bodyIs made seriously ill by disturbances of circulating energy, bile, or phlegm.Food and drink seem revolting,Sleep is impossible, lancing pain racks your body,And intolerably strong medicines and treatments, such as burning andblood-letting, must be borne.When this healthy body is struck suddenly by serious illness or demons, youcannot enjoy the food and drink you want; you must eat and drink what you don’twant. Sleep is impossible during the day and doesn’t come at night. Unbearablelancing pain racks your body; neither rest nor getting up are possible.Intolerably strong medicines and treatments must be borne; such suffering isunendurable. The Upper Commentary to the Hundred Procedures states:Those who are tormented by sicknessExperience sensations like those of the hells:Whatever the sufferings, they arise repeatedly,Like the pain of life in the hells.The Suffering of Death [4]When life’s creative force is spent, karma at an end, and conditions thatnurture life dissipate,The signs of death appear and delusory perceptions arise.You must leave behind this cherished body, possessions, family, and companionsTo wander alone along the terrifying passage between lifetimes.You assume the new miserable body your karma impels you to take—Miseries such as these make the suffering of death interminable. Howheartbreaking!When life’s creative force is spent; when its remaining forces of accumulatedkarma and goodness end; when conditions that nurture life dissipate, and allouter, inner, and secret signs of death appear, various delusory perceptionsarise. You must leave behind whatever you arduously dedicated your life to—food,wealth, possessions, your body, close friends, spouse, and family—and arecompelled to go alone to the dismal place of the period between lifetimes. Youmust assume whatever miserable new body your karma impels you to take, withoutany foreknowledge of what that will be. Such heartbreaking suffering isimmeasurable. Letter to a Disciple states:Along an arduous path through water, between close boulders and thick vines,Hampered by sharp thorns along fearsome paths,The dead are bound at the neck by the noose of time.Ferocious death demons brandish clubs as they lead the way.The Suffering of Meeting Hated Enemies [5]The suffering of meeting enemiesIncludes the misery of not having the means to prevent their harmTo your body or possessionsDue to their numbers; their foul, harmful acts; or their time of appearing.The suffering of meeting hated enemies is the constant sadness of not knowingwhen food, clothes, loved ones, wealth, possessions, or your own life will belost because dreaded enemies appear; because you do not have the means toprevent their harm when they appear; or you have few supporters.The Suffering of Separation from Loved Ones [6]When separated from loved ones,You remember their qualities and wail with many laments.Without companions or loved ones, your power is weak, your mind hesitant.You have no opportunity for happiness; you feel great anguish.When separated from loved ones, without making an effort to think of them,everything about them—their qualities and behavior—comes to mind and you heavelong sighs. You think little of profit or loss, and consider any activitymeaningless. Your mind becomes hesitant and you have no opportunity forhappiness; you feel anguish.The Suffering of Poverty and Destitution [7]With no food for your mouth, no clothes for your back,No place to stay, no useful wealth,You sink into the misery of poverty and destitution,When no matter how hard you try, you can’t accomplish the slightest fraction ofyour wishes.When you have no food, clothes, home, or useful possessions, you suffer andbecome depressed. No matter how hard you try physically, verbally, or mentally,it becomes difficult to accomplish even a fraction of your wishes.The Suffering of Contamination [8]The five contaminated psychophysical aggregations—Form, sensation, perception, formative factors, and consciousness—Are nothing but suffering’s support, vessel, and source.Form is the location where the harm of suffering takes manifest existence.Sensation, that which engages with phenomena, is suffering’s vessel. Perceptionis suffering’s support, the first door through which thoughts move. Formativefactors and consciousness are suffering’s source, the agent of acts and ofawareness. The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! Because the five psychophysical aggregations are contaminated, they arethe location of all suffering, the support for all suffering, the vessel for allsuffering, and the source of all suffering.THE SUFFERING FROM CONFLICT AMONG DEMIGODS [V] [05_toc-title.html#sec-25]Ennobling acts influenced by jealousy and associated factorsResult in birth as a demigod of four kinds.They feel overpowering jealousy toward the gods’ wealth and splendorAnd are wounded or killed in battle during conflicts and disputes with the gods.Ennobling acts influenced by jealousy and its associated factors result in birthas a demigod of four kinds. Demigods feel overpowering jealousy toward the gods’wealth and splendor. Their acts in battles and disputes lead them to experienceboundless panic and suffering from wounds, or having their head or limbs cut offand dying, and so on. Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:As for the demigods, because they naturally despise the gods’ splendor,They suffer great mental anguish.These beings are intelligent,But are obscured and cannot see the truth.THE SUFFERING FROM DEATH AND FALLING AMONG GODS [VI] [05_toc-title.html#sec-26]This chapter has three parts: (1) the suffering of death and falling experiencedby gods of the desire realm, (2) the suffering of seeing the next life for godsof the form and formless realms, and (3) a teaching on the need to achievefreedom for yourself once you have understood the round of rebirth as suffering.The Suffering of Death and Falling among Desire Realm Gods [A]Accumulating a large number of the ten ennobling acts motivated by pride resultsin birth as a god of the desire realm.When they suffer death and falling,Their color worsens, their seat becomes uncomfortable, their flowers wilt,Their clothes reek, and their bodies perspire.Abandoned by friends, they sit alone and confused.With clairvoyant power, they see the place of their future rebirth: they becometerrified.These unbearable experiences last for seven days of the gods.Accumulating a large number of the ten ennobling acts motivated by pride resultsin birth as a god of the desire realm. The six kinds of desire realm gods havefive signs at death: their bodies’ color becomes unattractive; their seatbecomes uncomfortable; the flowers on their heads wilt; their clothes reek; andthey perspire for the first time.Their friends abandon them—they sit alone. With clairvoyant power, they see theplace of their future rebirth. This suffering of death and falling, like that ofa fish thrown on hot sand, lasts for seven days. Letter from a Spiritual Friendstates:After reflection on that,The best individuals no longer crave for the higher realms, which will passaway.The gods’ color becomes unattractive;Their seats become uncomfortable; their flower garlands wilt;Clothes reek;And their bodies perspire for the first time.These five signs of impending death, lamps that signal death in the higherrealm,Appear to gods in the heavens.The Suffering of Seeing the Next Life for Gods of the Form and Formless Realms[B]When the form realm gods’ karma of meditative stability is spentOr when the formless gods’ karma of stillness is exhausted,They plummet from level to level, experiencing endless descent into thesuffering of conditioned existence.Therefore, attainment of higher existences is but a fleeting respite fromsuffering.When the form realm gods’ propelling karma of meditative stability is spent orwhen the formless gods’ karma of stillness is exhausted, they plummet from levelto level, experiencing myriad sufferings in the round of rebirth. Since eventhese gods do not transcend this round, the attainment of higher existences isnothing but a fleeting respite from suffering, and has no lasting value.Nagarjuna states:Those who live in naturally present meditative stability, such as the gods ofthe Pure,Exhibit boundless radiance, colors, and beauty,But since they do not perceive their own latent thoughts of self,After they die, they may even be reborn in hell!Letter to a Disciple states:There is no place in the universe you have not made home;There is no place in space you have not traveled.Nevertheless, your desires still increaseAlthough there is no suffering you have not already experienced many times.The Need to Achieve Freedom for Yourself Once You Have Understood the Round ofRebirth as Suffering [C]Since suffering exists wherever you are born within the round of rebirth,You must exert yourself to achieve freedom.The techniques taught by innumerable victors have not been sufficient inthemselves:Think, “I will strive above all else at the sublime means to reach freedomAnd accomplish my aspirations for a lasting state of sure excellence.”Wherever we are born within the round of rebirth, high or low, that life is likean illness that brings constant pain, or like upper or lower stories within thesame prison. Therefore, if we don’t exert ourselves wholeheartedly to achievefreedom, it is difficult for the buddhas to subdue us. Innumerable buddhas haveappeared in the past but were unable to guide us: we have been left behind. Ourkarma and mental afflictions were too strong: we turned our backs on freedom’spath and mistakenly sought happiness within the round of rebirth. Therefore, weshould think repeatedly, “From now on I will strive day and night at the sacredBuddhist doctrine, the means to freedom, and accomplish my aspirations for alasting state of sure excellence, the sacred exalted state of enlightenment.”The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:I have taught you the means to achieve freedom;Freedom depends on you: be diligent!Shantideva (in Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas) states:To aid sentient beings,Innumerable buddhas have attained transcendence;Yet due to my own fault,I was not among those they healed.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSIn the three worlds’ frightful imprisoning trench,The three bonds’ ropes hold you tightly,And the three sufferings’ punishments torment you continually.The three miserable existences’ weapons are very sharp and painful.On this wide plain of the round of rebirth’s unending anguish,Birth, aging, sickness, and death’s sharp thorns pierce you;Heat, cold, hunger, and thirst’s barren earth and stone surround you;Myriad sufferings’ savage, wild animals attack you.The mountains of flesh, bones, limbs you have discarded rise high;The oceans of blood, pus, and tears you have shed measure deep;The bodies of your various karmic rebirths swirl like fine atoms:How sad, this dense darkness of ignorant folly!This concludes a commentary to “The Flaws of the Round of Rebirth,” Book 6 ofThe Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work thatelucidates all ways of spiritual development. I, Longchen Choying Tobden Dorje,wrote this to foster certainty that from now on we must strive intently to freeourselves from the round of rebirth’s imprisoning trench. We have previouslytaken innumerable births within the great ocean of the round of rebirth’s sixrealms and experienced boundless sufferings. Further, if we cannot find time nowto strive for freedom, we will again take an inconceivable number of rebirthsand be obliged to undergo myriad sufferings.

How to Take Refuge, the Foundation for All Vows2. How to Keep the Seven Kinds of Individual Liberation Vows3. An Explanation of the Foundation, Paths, and Results of the Hearers’ Way4. An Explanation of the Foundation, Paths, and Results of the Solitary Sages’WayThese chapters contain a total of thirty-six headings.HOW TO TAKE REFUGE, THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL VOWS [I] [05_toc-title.html#sec-27]This chapter has eight parts: (1) the individual who takes refuge, (2) theperiod for which refuge is taken, (3) in whom refuge is taken—the three jewels,(4) how to take refuge as a cause for a later result, (5) taking refuge as aresult in itself, (6) training in refuge as a cause and as a result, (7) how therefuge vows are violated, and (8) the benefits of taking refuge.The Individual Who Takes Refuge [A]Refuge is taken in fear of the round of rebirth as described,And with the wish for freedom.Lesser individuals take refuge in fear of miserable existencesAnd to gain the higher existences of gods and humans.The two kinds of middle individual fear the round of rebirth.Great individuals take refuge to liberate all beings and in fear of bothexistence and the bliss of static peace.These three individuals’ attitudes are inferior, middle, and best.People belong to one of three groups. Lesser individuals take refuge in thethree jewels wishing for pleasant results within the round of rebirth and infear of miserable existences. This impure motivation relegates them to the rankof lesser individuals. The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:Ananda explained to a brahmin woman how taking refuge would result in theattainment of the higher realms. The Transcendent Conqueror remarked, “Ananda!That is not the right approach! Those who strive for worldly happiness arecalled ‘inferior.’ Therefore, genuinely proclaim the qualities of liberation.”Middle individuals, those with an affinity for the hearer or solitary sage ways,take refuge in fear of the round of rebirth, and seek peace for their own sakes.The Sacred Victory Banner Discourse states:Those who have taken refugeIn the Buddha, doctrine, and spiritual community,See with the eyes of sublime insightThe four noble truths—Suffering, the source of suffering,The true transcendence of sorrow,And the eightfold exalted pathThat leads to such transcendence.Those refuges are the principal ones;They are sublime.Based on those refuges,You become completely free from suffering.Great individuals take refuge for others’ sake, in fear of both existence andthe bliss of static peace. The Discourse of Great Liberation states:Whoever takes refuge for the sake of those who have fallen into the river ofexistence and fully rejects personal peace out of fear of that state is calledthe most sublime individual or a holy leader.Lamp on the Path to Awakening states:Three kinds of individualCan be known as lesser, middle, and sublime.To distinguish between themAccording to their distinct characteristics, I write these words:Those who are content with worldly happinessGained through any means,And strive for their own goodAre known as “lesser individuals.”Those who turn their backs on worldly happiness,Turn away from wrongdoing,And strive for personal peace aloneAre called “middle individuals.”Those who, based on their own suffering,Sincerely yearnFor the end of others’ sufferingsAre “sublime individuals.”Among lesser individuals, some are non-Buddhists reborn in the higher realmsthrough purity, nonviolence, and spiritual practice; while others have takenrefuge in the Buddhist three jewels and have reached the higher realms throughsome goodness. In either case, they must make their guiding principles the tenennobling acts consistent with goodness and formless states of meditativestability, since without them, a future rebirth within the higher realms isimpossible. Non-Buddhist spiritual traditions, such as that of the Hinduenumerator tradition, have some, but not all, teachings related to thosesubjects.Middle individuals definitely enter the paths of the hearers or solitary sages;great individuals, the path of the great way.The Period for Which Refuge Is Taken [B]The duration of refuge: Lesser individuals take refuge until they achievepositive results later.Middle individuals take refuge either temporarily, for as long as they live,Or ultimately, until they achieve the results of the ways of hearers or solitarysages.Great individuals take refuge until they reach unsurpassable awakening.Common individuals take refuge until they gain whatever they wish from theirchosen god; special individuals take refuge until they reach the higher realms.In the context of this teaching, such persons resemble the lesser individual.The two kinds of middle individual take refuge either temporarily—for as long asthey live—or ultimately, until they achieve the state of an uncorrupted arhat.Great individuals take refuge until they reach the heart of unsurpassableawakening, the wisdom of enlightenment.In Whom Refuge Is Taken—the Three Jewels [C]The formless body of ultimate enlightenment is endowed with five kinds ofvision, six forms of clairvoyance,Ten powers, aspects of retention, ten forces,Four forms of fearlessness, four modes of individual awareness,And eighteen unique qualities.Enlightenment’s two bodies that have form—the body of perfect rapture and thesublime manifest body—Display the thirty-two excellent signs, the eighty marks of physical perfection,And all sixty aspects of melodious speech. They epitomize wisdom, love, andcapability.The doctrine of scripture comprises discourses, aphorisms in verse,Prophetic declarations, verses, meaningful expressions, narratives,Parables, legends, extensive teachings,Tales of past lives, established instructions, and marvelous events;And the tantras—action, conduct, yoga, father, mother, and nondual.The doctrine of realization comprises realizationGained from experiential cultivation on the paths of the ways of the discoursesand tantras.The spiritual community comprises hearers and solitary sages in four pairs,The victors’ heirs who have reached stages of awakening, and hosts of dakinis,adepts, and awareness holders.The Refuge of the BuddhaThe formless body of ultimate enlightenment is endowed with the following fivekinds of vision: omniscient sight, sight of all phenomena, sight of sublimeinsight, divine sight, and physical sight. Six forms of clairvoyance: miraculousabilities, clairaudience, knowledge of others’ minds, recollection of pastlives, clairvoyance of divine sight, and the end of contamination. Ten powers:over longevity, mind, necessities, acts, birth, interest, aspiration, miracles,wisdom, and instruction. Aspects of retention include undiminished recollection,no distraction due to thoughts, an intellect without delusion, manifest sublimeinsight, and knowledge of each specific word of all teachings.Ten forces: unhindered knowledge; knowledge of every substantial thing of thepast, present, and future; knowledge of sentient beings’ various interests;knowledge of sentient beings’ various constituent natures; knowledge of sublimeand nonsublime acumen; knowledge of beings’ paths; knowledge of mentalafflictions and purification; knowledge of recollection of previous places;knowledge of death, transmigration, and rebirth; and knowledge of the end ofcontamination.Four forms of fearlessness: fearlessness toward magnificent realization,fearlessness toward impediments to presentation of the teachings, fearlessnesstoward showing the path, and fearlessness toward magnificent renunciation. Fourmodes of genuine individual awareness: genuine individual awareness ofphenomena, genuine individual awareness of meaning, genuine individual awarenessof words, and genuine individual awareness of confidence.In The Highest Continuity, Bodhisattva Invincible Lord (a name of BodhisattvaMaitreya) listed the buddhas’ eighteen unique qualities:Buddhas (1) make no mistakes and (2) do not chatter.Teachers have (3) faultless recollection.(4) Their mind has no lapse in settling in evenness,(5) Nor do they have various dualistic perceptions.(6) Their composure is not without discrimination.They are not subject to failure in(7) Intention, (8) diligence, (9) recollection,(10) Sublime insight, (11) complete liberation, and (12) the wise sight ofcomplete liberation.(13–15) Wisdom precedes their acts in body, speech, and mind;And (16–18) their wisdom sees time past, present, and future withoutobscuration.These are the teachers’Eighteen natural unique qualities.Wisdom bodies that have form display enlightenment’s thirty-two excellent signs,such as flat soles, a thousand-spoked wheel design on the palms and soles, andlong and narrow fingers and toes. The eighty marks of physical perfectioninclude fingernails that are copper-colored pink; shiny; and withoutdepressions. Returning the Buddha’s Kindness Discourse states:If all the goodness of every sentient being was gathered in one place, it wouldequal the sign of perfection of one pore of the transcendent buddhas. If thegoodness of their every pore was gathered and heaped together, this would equalone of the eighty marks of physical perfection. If all the goodness of everymark of physical perfection was multiplied one hundred times, this would equalone of the thirty-two signs of physical perfection, apart from the curl of whitehair between their eyebrows and the invisible mark on the crown of their head.The goodness of the other signs of perfection, multiplied by one thousand,equals the last two. All the goodness of the thirty-two signs and the eightymarks gathered and heaped together, multiplied ten million times, equals thesign of the transcendent buddhas’ deep, melodious, thunder-like voice which farresounds. The sound of their speech resonates throughout buddhas’ pure lands inlimitless, infinite, inconceivable numbers, equal to the number of the finestatoms, and their voice acts with pervasive love and compassion for the benefitof sentient beings, in the knowledge of their kindness and in repayment for it.This is inconceivable.The sixty aspects of melodious speech include soft, gentle, compelling,agreeable, pure, faultless, completely clear, sweet-sounding, and worthwhile.Buddhas epitomize the knowledge of phenomena’s nature and multiplicity,immeasurable loving compassion, and the infinite capability of enlightenedactivity.The Refuge of the DoctrineThe sacred doctrine has two categories, scripture and realization. The doctrineof scripture comprises the three turnings of the doctrine’s wheel, itseighty-four thousand (or eight ten-thousand, plus four thousand) aggregations ofinstructions gathered into twelve categories of the Buddha’s speech, thefollowing: (1) Discourses present the meaning of any desired subject spoken inthe mode of brief dialogues. They are called discourses because they areexpressed in prose. (2) Aphorisms in verse are verses of melodious poetryinterspersed within the discourse or found at its conclusion, or discourses thatare still subject to further analysis and thus constitute conventional meaning.(3) Prophetic declarations include such information as predictions concerningthe past lives, deaths, and future rebirths of hearers, bodhisattvas, andothers. This category also includes any clarification and definition of theBuddha’s intention, and thus, this category includes discourses of definitivemeaning. (4) Verses include any scripture spoken that was composed in verses oftwo to six stanzas. (5) Meaningful expressions include declarations made not inrelation to an individual’s request, but by the Transcendent Conqueror’s owninitiative, spoken only in the spirit of ensuring the preservation of histeaching. (6) Narratives include words spoken for some individuals’ benefit andto introduce points of training in the monastic code, for instance, includingthe story of their original context. (7) Parables include teachings ofanalogies, including those drawn from other accounts, to aid those who listen tothe teachings to understand their meaning and to gain excellent realization. (8)Legends include teachings of proverbs from past generations. (9) Tales of pastlives recount well the time when the Transcendent Conqueror performed the actsof a bodhisattva—who he was, where he was born, his hardships, and his deeds.(10) Extensive teachings include extremely vast and profound teachings, such asthose within the great way’s bodhisattva collection of teachings on the stagesof awakening and the six transcendent perfections. (11) Marvelous events includeamazing and marvelous accounts of the wisdom, miracles, blessing power, and soon, of hearers, bodhisattvas, and perfect buddhas. (12) Established instructionsinclude presentations of the discourses and other texts’ correct meaning,through definitions of the general and specific characteristics of allphenomena.The three collections are as stated in The Minor Scripture on the Monastic Codeof Conduct:Five classes of teachings—discourses, aphorisms in verse,Prophetic declarations, verses,And meaningful expressions—are gathered in the collection of discourses.Four classes of teachings—narratives, parables,What are called legends,And tales of past lives—are gathered in the collection on discipline.Three classes of teachings—extensive teachings, marvelous events,And established instructions—are gathered in the collection on observedphenomena.How are the three trainings found within these three collections? Vasubandhustates:The three collections present the three trainings. The collection on disciplinepresents higher ethical conduct and higher mind training. Maintaining ethicalconduct leads in stages, such as having no regrets, to meditative states. Thecollection on observed phenomena accomplishes higher sublime insight since itpresents the incontrovertible meaning.If considered separately, the awareness holders’ collection constitutes a fourthcollection. Aryadeva states:The awareness holders’ collection . . .This collection includes six groups of tantras: three groups of exoterictantras—action, conduct, and yoga; and three groups of esoteric highesttantras—father, mother, and nondual great perfection.All discourses and tantras that appear in the form of words comprise thedoctrine of scripture.The doctrine of realization comprises realizations in the stream of wisdom mindbased on experiential cultivation: the paths of cultivation, application,seeing, and meditation—the hearers and solitary sages’ eight stages of awakeningand the bodhisattvas’ ten stages of awakening; and the path of no furthertraining—all qualities of such stages as the eleventh, Universal Light; thetwelfth, Lotus-Possessing; and the thirteenth, Vajra Bearer.The hearers’ and solitary sages’ eight stages of awakening are listed in TheMiddle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight:These are the hearers and solitary sages’ stages of awakening: the stage ofaffinity, the eighth stage, the stage of seeing, the subtle stage, the stagefree from desire, the stage of realization of acts, the stage of the hearer, andthe stage of the solitary sage.The Refuge of the Spiritual CommunityIn the lesser way, the spiritual community comprises hearers and solitary sagesin four pairs, thus eight: the pair of hearers or solitary sages who entered thestage of stream-enterer and those who abide in the result of stream-enterer,entering and abiding returners, entering and abiding nonreturners, and enteringand abiding arhats.Nonreturning bodhisattvas’ spiritual community has eight qualities of liberatedawareness. The first three are the qualities of awareness of phenomena’s nature,awareness of phenomena’s multiplicity, and awareness that sees inner wisdom. Thenext three are techniques to gain these: the qualities of liberation from theobscurations of attachment (that is, the part that is relinquished on the pathwithout obstacles); the qualities of liberation from the obscurations ofimpediments (on that same path without obstacles); and the qualities ofliberation from the obscurations of inferior spiritual approaches (on that samepath). To these are added the last two, the basisof the identification of these six: the qualities of awareness and the qualitiesof liberation.The inner spiritual community includes spiritual heroes, dakinis, protectors ofthe doctrine, and guardians, who possess eyes of wisdom. Among these, some flyin space, or move powerfully, or are born from mantras or activity. Thisspiritual community also includes the supramundane assemblies belonging to thewisdom clans—transcendent, vajra, jewel, lotus, and action; and gatherings ofawareness holders who rest on the stages or results of the attainment of thefour states of awareness holder: awareness holder subject to the maturation ofkarma, awareness holder with control over longevity, awareness holder of supremeseal, and awareness holder of spontaneous presence.Why are the Buddha, doctrine, and spiritual community called “jewels”? Theiromniscient wisdom, which is impossible to find elsewhere, encompasses allknowledge without hindrance: they are rare, like precious, wish-fulfillingjewels. They have loving compassion for all beings as if each was their onlychild. They are even bound uncontrollably by this love, and are thus impartialtoward any possibility—praise or blame, close or distant connections; and theyare free from the impurity of disharmony. They have the supreme strength toguide every sentient being, and their inexhaustible qualities adorn the entireworld. They lead beings through boundless enlightened activity. The HighestContinuity states:Because they appear rarely,Are flawless and powerful,Adorn the world, and are sublime and changeless,They are jewels.Perspectives on the Three JewelsIn general, according to the common, lesser way, the Buddha is the suprememanifest body of enlightenment; the doctrine is the epitome of scripture andrealization, the twelve categories of the excellent speech of the Buddha, and,in each individual’s mind, such things as the spiritual path and meditativestates. In the lesser way, the lesser spiritual community is that of ordinaryindividuals—male and female novices and laypersons—since they provide beingswith a field for the cultivation of goodness. The sublime spiritual communitycomprises those who have taken full ordination. As is said,The sublime spiritual community of the fully ordained . . .If the number of fully ordained individuals reaches four, this is called agathering of the spiritual community. The exalted spiritual community comprisesindividuals who have attained the state of stream-enterer, returner,nonreturner, or arhat.According to the great way, the Buddha personifies the three wisdom bodies. Thedoctrine’s essence is indescribable, inconceivable, and ineffable; its nature isthe path or remedy that leads to enlightenment. Its appearing aspect is thatwhich has the characteristics of the truth of the path and the truth ofcessation—the ultimate doctrine. The verbal doctrine is the twelve categories ofthe Buddha’s excellent speech. The spiritual community comprises those who havenewly gained sight of the meaning of the mind’s luminous nature, exalted oneswho dwell on awakening’s ten stages.According to action and conduct tantras, the Buddha personifies the four wisdombodies, whose emanations and blessed deities are gathered in three wisdomclans—buddha, lotus, and vajra—as deities of major or minor sacred circles, whodisplay peaceful or wrathful attributes as the body of perfect rapture or as themanifest body. The doctrine is as mentioned above, plus the texts of the actionand conduct tantras. The spiritual community comprises the hearers,bodhisattvas, and awareness holders.According to the yoga tantras, the Buddha is the sacred circles’ peaceful andwrathful wisdom deities appearing as central and surrounding deities gatheredinto five wisdom clans. The doctrine is as above, plus the yoga tantras; thespiritual community is as before.According to the highest yoga tantras, the Buddha is the transcendent conquerorof supreme rapture, inseparable from all those who epitomize all transcendentbuddhas’ vajra body, speech, and mind in the gatherings of various central andencircling deities, and all emanations that issue from those sacred circles. Thedoctrine is the highest yoga tantra; the spiritual community is composed ofpersons who cultivate the experience of the highest tantras.How to Take Refuge as a Cause for a Later Result [D]In the vivid presence of the places of refuge, imagined in space,All beings respectfully fold hands in prayer with you and recite:“To become free from every dangerOf the realms of existence and of static peace,I respectfully take refuge with faith in the spiritual master,The Buddha, the doctrine, and the spiritual community, until I attainunsurpassable awakening.”After repeating those lines three times, consider that you receive the refugevows.The givers of refuge joyfully send their blessings in the form of a mass oflightThat purifies your own and every being’s physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoingand obscurations:This completes your cultivation of goodness and plants the fortune for you toattain enlightenment’s bodies that have form.The Buddha is the teacher of your teacher of refuge;The doctrine is the path; the spiritual community, your companions in itspractice.The places of refuge dwell in the sky before you. In the center sits yourprincipal spiritual master, surrounded by a congregation of the lineage masters;the Buddha, the teacher who epitomizes the three wisdom bodies; peaceful andwrathful deities; and the victors’ spiritual heirs—bodhisattvas, hearers,solitary sages, and awareness holders. Behind them, the scriptural doctrine ofdiscourses and tantras in the form of volumes are carefully arranged. Spiritualheroes, dakinis, and protectors, who guard the doctrine, gather like circling,billowing clouds, surrounding them.In their presence—our parents, all sentient beings of the six kinds whosenumbers fill space and we ourselves—fold our hands at our hearts in physicalrespect, sing fervently the words of refuge with verbal respect, and with utmostfaith and in utter fear of the frailty of the round of rebirth and states ofstatic peace, we recite:I take refuge in the spiritual master and the three jewels until I attainunsurpassable awakening.After having taken refuge by repeating those words three times, think that youreceive the vows of refuge. Finally, the field for your cultivation of goodnessjoyfully sends blessings in the form of a mass of light that purifies your ownand every sentient being’s physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing andobscurations. This completes your store of goodness and plants in your stream ofbeing the fortune to attain the bodies of enlightenment that have form.In taking refuge, consider the Buddha as the teacher of your teacher of refuge;the doctrine as the path; and the spiritual community as your companions in thepractice of refuge. The Pinnacle of Jewels Discourse states:Whoever takes refuge in the threeWill fully complete the stores of goodness and wisdom,Achieve enlightenment,And gain the doctrine and the spiritual community.Taking Refuge as the Result in Itself [E]The place of refuge which is the result is the body of ultimate enlightenment’swisdom—The ultimate jewel, luminosity, the sublime state free from embellishment.Settle in evenness in the ultimate ongoing stateIn which the giver of refuge and the taker of refuge are indivisible.This completes the store of wisdom and leads to the attainment of the body ofultimate enlightenment.After, in the understanding of phenomena as illusory, dedicate the goodness ofthe act of having taken refuge.In taking refuge done as a cause for a later result, you considered the threejewels in the sky before you as the appearing aspect of the place of refuge; andall sentient beings and you yourself as the takers of refuge. Now, in takingrefuge as the result in itself, you consider that ultimately, apart from yourown mind’s miraculous appearances, neither the taker of refuge nor the giver ofrefuge has even an iota of separate existence. The mind’s nature is totallyimpartial, its essence like space. Therefore, settle in an ongoing state withoutembellishment. The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insightstates:Subhuti! When even the Buddha is not imagined, and neither the doctrine nor thespiritual community conceived of, that is the true taking of refuge.The Highest Continuity states:The doctrine’s two aspects and the exalted assemblyAre not sublime, permanent refuges.The Buddha is the sole refuge,Since that refuge has the body of ultimate enlightenmentAnd is the final goal of the ultimate assembly.This nonconceptual emptiness constitutes the cultivation of wisdom, whichaccomplishes the formless body of ultimate enlightenment. The Discourse ThatPresents the Two Truths states:Manjushri! Stores of goodness have you attain enlightenment’s bodies that haveform; stores of wisdom actualize the holy formless body of ultimateenlightenment.After, within the understanding that appearing existence, the round of rebirthand transcendent states, appears even as it does not exist, like a dream or amagical display, dedicate the goodness of taking refuge to the attainment ofenlightenment.Training in Refuge as a Cause and as a Result [F]Training in refuge as a cause includes the following points: do not forsake thespiritual master and the three jewelsEven for the sake of your life or country.After having taken refuge in the spiritual master, do not mislead venerablepersons;Forsake slander or unpleasant speech to holy persons.After having taken refuge in the Buddha, do not bow or make offerings to othergods; respect Buddhist images.After having taken refuge in the doctrine,Renounce harming others; respect the slightest amount of the written word.After having taken refuge in the spiritual community, do not make closefriendships with non-Buddhists, and foster respect toward even a scrap of orangecloth.During the day and night’s six sessions, remember the three jewels and takerefuge.Training in refuge as a result includes training in the native state of thenature of reality,Unembellished by concepts of high and low, what must be done or not done, and soon.Do not forsake the three jewels for the sake of your life or country, asShantideva states:Don’t give up the large for the sake of the small:The main point is the thought of others’ welfare.The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states:Do not renounce the three jewels for the sake of your life, your country, oreven for as little as laughter.To not mislead the spiritual master is stated in The Pattern of the Stem:In relying on spiritual mentors, do not deceive venerable persons, completelyforsake saying unpleasant words to holy persons, and follow the sacred doctrine.The training in taking refuge in the three jewels is as stated in The GreatTranscendence of Sorrow Discourse:Who takes refuge in the BuddhaAnd never takes refugeIn other godsIs a genuine layperson.Who takes refuge in the sacred doctrineIs free from harming others and thoughts of doing so.Who takes refuge in the spiritual communityDoes not side with non-Buddhists.The White Lotus Discourse states:He sent emanations in many forms at that placeTo aid beings’ ennobling practice.The Upper Earring states:In the final age of five hundred years,I will dwell in the form of words:With “It is the Buddha!” in mind,Respect them at that time.Remember the jewels and take refuge continually day and night, or at the six orthree designated times during the day, or at least once a day.Training in refuge as a result in itself is as stated in The Middle-LengthVersion of the Mother of Sublime Insight:Those who wish to meditate on the perfection of sublime insight should train tonot conceptualize any phenomena and to not later look back at them. What doesthis mean? “This is best; that is inferior.” “This is to be done; that is to berejected.” “This is the Buddha’s doctrine; that is other ascetic sages’teachings.” Do not examine things in such a dualistic fashion.How the Refuge Vows Are Violated [G]The refuge vows are given up when wrong views have arisen and the training isviolated.When wrong views have arisen, and you reject the three jewels, are unable topractice refuge, and offer back the training in refuge, this constitutes theformal cause for giving up refuge vows. Slight violations of the training, suchas by rendering homage to other gods, are called “an inferior tendency.”These faults resemble a monarch whose family has lost its status—you are nolonger a Buddhist. Like merchants deceived by their escort, you are fearful inwhatever you do. Like a painting made on a crumbling wall, all training and vowsbased on refuge are easily destroyed once the refuge vows are violated. Like acommon person without supporters, you are easily beset by harm. Like a personwho has broken the law, violating the promise of refuge causes many misfortunes,such as rebirth in the miserable existences.Therefore, having surveyed the shortcomings of violating the training of refuge,you should regretfully admit any fault in the training and repair it by takingrefuge again with determination to keep it in the future.The Benefits of Taking Refuge [H]The benefits of refuge are freedom from fear during future lifetimes;Rapid completion of the stores of goodness and wisdom; increase of qualities;And protection by benevolent gods: refuge has limitless benefits.It forms the supreme foundation for all qualities.The benefits of refuge include not falling to the miserable existences andrebirth in the higher realms, as stated in The Parable of the Pig:Those who take refuge in the BuddhaWill not go to the miserable realms;Even after relinquishing human life (that is, death),They will be reborn in the body of a god.That the two stores of goodness and wisdom are completed in taking refuge isstated in The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse:Who takes refuge in the three jewelsCultivates sacred stores of goodness and wisdom,Spreads the Victor’s doctrine in the world,And will attain enlightenment itself.The benefit of the limitless qualities of having taken refuge is stated in TheDiscourse Requested by the Precious Child:Those who have taken refuge in the Buddha will experience the manifest increaseof every ennobling quality; they will know modesty; and they will beconscientious.Those who have taken refuge in the teachings will become careful; they will havemany qualities; they will always recall their past lives; and they will gaintheir share of the collections of the doctrine.Those who have taken refuge in the spiritual community will see their mindsbecome supple; many gates to meditative states and retention will open; theywill always belong to a noble family; and even in dreams they will not beseparated from the Buddha, doctrine, and spiritual community.The benefit of the gods’ protection is stated in the same text:Further, gods who feel very joyful in positive acts will protect you. Moreover,the root of your ennobling acts will increase.That the benefits are limitless is stated in The Unstained Discourse:If the benefits of having taken refugeHad form,They would fill the sphere of spaceAnd still exceed its bounds.The Sacred Victory Banner Discourse states:O fully ordained ones! You may stay in secluded hermitages, cemeteries, emptyplains, and other such places. Take refuge in the three jewels: this willeradicate any cause you might have for fear, suffering, or anxiety.The Essence of the Sun Discourse states:When sentient beings go for refuge in the Buddha,Ten million demons cannot kill them.Even if their ethical conduct is damaged and their minds become deranged,They will certainly transcend rebirth.That refuge forms the foundation of all qualities is stated in The SeventyVerses on Refuge:Although you might claim you have every vow,Without refuge, you don’t have any.The Pinnacle of Jewels Discourse states:The wise emulate the example of others’ qualities;They thereby accomplish magnificent goals.As stated in The Pinnacle of Jewels Discourse and The Moon Lamp Discourse, youshould remember the three jewels by repeating passages in those texts thatbegin, “Just as the one called the Buddha, the Transcendent Conqueror . . .”Thus, emphasizing the taking refuge, the foundation for all vows, is to becherished at the beginning of the path.HOW TO KEEP THE SEVEN KINDS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERATION VOWS [II][05_toc-title.html#sec-28]This chapter has eight parts: (1) the original setting of the vows, (2) theessence of the vows, (3) classification of the vows, (4) how to receive the vowsnot yet taken, (5) how to keep the vows taken, (6) the life that is the supportfor the vows, (7) how the vows are violated, and (8) how to restore the vows.The Original Setting of the Vows [A]In the sublime doctrinal cycle of the four truths,The Teacher, the Buddha, emphasized training in ethical conduct.In Varanasi, he taught this to the five excellent individuals. Upali compiledthese teachings.Five hundred arhats composed The Treasury of Detailed Explanation.Gunaprabha wrote and spread The Root Discourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct;Shakyaprabha, The Three-Hundred-Verse Commentary on the Training of Novices, andother texts.In Tibet, Shantarakshita spread the lineage of the substantialist order’s vows.The original translations include four texts on the transmission of discipline:The Basic Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct, The Detailed Scripture onthe Monastic Code of Conduct, The Supplementary Scripture on the Monastic Codeof Conduct, and The Highest Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct.These books contain a total of 104,800 stanzas.The Tibetan canon contains seventy-two discoursesAnd sixty-three treatises of commentary that belong to this cycle.In the region of Varanasi, on the fourth day of the sixth lunar month, theTeacher Shakyamuni began teaching to the circle of the five excellentindividuals and to eighty thousand gods. His instructions emphasized the subjectof training in higher ethical conduct.Within the written record of those teachings, the collection on the monasticcode has three parts: the collection on the monastic code’s section onregulations provides an extensive presentation of designated and natural ethicalconduct;10 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st10] its discourse section delineates thestages of the contemplative practice of meditative states and pure conduct; andits observed phenomena section presents the stages of renunciation andantidotes, including detailed explanations of the regulations’ and discourses’classifications.The circle of five excellent individuals attained the state of arhat based ontheir experiential cultivation of Buddha’s turning of this wheel of the fournoble truths. After the Teacher’s transcendence of sorrow, Upali compiled thecollection on the monastic code.Treatises based on these texts were composed as follows: During the Buddha’slifetime, Shariputra, Maudgalyayana, Purna, and others composed the seven textson observed phenomena. After the Buddha’s transcendence of sorrow, five hundredarhats composed The Great Treasury of Detailed Explanation, which contains onehundred thousand stanzas. Master Vasubandhu composed the root text andcommentary of The Treasury of Observed Phenomena. Gunaprabha wrote worksincluding The Root Discourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct and The HundredProcedures. Shakyaprabha wrote The Three-Hundred-Verse Commentary on theTraining of Novices and other texts. All these works continue to be propagatedin the present day.Here in the Himalayan region, the original transmission of the monastic vowsoriginated with the great Indian preceptor Shantarakshita, who spread thelineage of the substantialist order vows. Later, Lord Atisha spread the lineageof the great community order vows.In Tibet, the original translations include translations of four texts on thetransmission of monastic discipline:1.

Further, sixty-three treatises ofcommentary related to these texts were translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan.The Essence of the Vows [B]The essence of the vows is abjuration, based on an attitude of disengagement,Of acts that harm others and the basis of such acts.Since the vows arise based upon the body and voice,They are considered to have form.The seed of a continual attitude of renunciation is crucial.The essence of individual liberation vows is abjuration, motivated by anattitude of disengagement that sees the entire round of rebirth as a fire pit,of acts that harm others and the basis of such acts. Since these vows must arisebased upon the body and voice, they are considered to have form. However, acontinual attitude of renunciation, in the manner of a seed, is crucial.Classification of the Vows [C]The vows’ classification includes three vows for laypersons:Vows for temporary fasting, and vows for male and female laypersons;And five kinds of vows for renunciants: vows for male novice monk and femalenovice nun, female spiritual apprentice, and fully ordained monk and fullyordained nun.Together, these constitute the eight kinds of individual liberation vows.Another classification counts four: vows of temporary fasting, layperson,novice, and full ordination.The classification of the vows includes three kinds of vows for laypersons: atemporary fasting vow, male layperson’s vows, female layperson’s vows; and fivekinds of vows for renunciants: male novice, female novice, female spiritualapprentice, fully ordained monk, and fully ordained nun.Together, these constitute the eight kinds of individual liberation vows.Classified according to content, four kinds of vows are counted: temporaryfasting, layperson, novice monastic ordination, and full monastic ordination.How to Receive the Vows Not Yet Taken [D]Rituals of former times to receive vows included natural full ordination;Full ordination was also completed by understanding wisdom; acceptance of thecommand, “Come forward!”;Promises; replies to questions; and messages.In modern rituals, an individual free of the five certain hindrances and withnone of the four obstaclesReceives the ordination gradually, in three stages.In the former two stages, before full ordination, refuge,Personal affirmation, and others’ acceptance constitute the three parts.The vows arise after the personal affirmation. In the latter stage, whichcomprises recitations of the essence, action, and performance,The vows arise immediately after the action recitation.In former times, rituals through which an individual reached full ordinationincluded the following: the perfect Buddha and solitary sages became fullyordained monks through self-arisen wisdom—this is to say, by virtue of theirknowledge of cessation and nonarising. The circle of five excellent individualsbecame monks through understanding wisdom when the path of seeing arose in theirstream of being. These three (the Buddha, solitary sages, and the fivedisciples) reached full ordination when the ultimate state of full ordinationarose in their experience.Shariputra became a monk when he accepted the Buddha’s command, “Come forward!”;Mahakashyapa, when he promised to accept the Buddha as his teacher;Bhadranivaha, when he promised to take refuge in the three jewels; and PrajapatiGautami and others, when she promised to renounce the eight serious acts.Likewise, Adhavari, whose parents controlled him, received ordination throughmessages carried by the fully ordained nun Utpala.In modern rituals, postulants for ordination must be free from five certainhindrances as follows: place—the thought that they can keep the ordination in aregion where conducive circumstances are complete but not elsewhere; time—thethought that they can keep the ordination for a certain number of years ormonths but not longer than that; circumstance—the thought that they can keep theordination except during disputes; sentient being—the thought that they will notkill anyone except enemies; and secondary vows—the thought that they can keepthe major vows but not the minor ones. They must renounce these five.They must also have none of the four obstacles concerning (1) birth—to have beenborn without genitals, or to have committed such deeds as one of the five actsof immediate fruition; (2) residence—to have not received the permission fromthe ruler or the postulant’s parents to take ordination; (3) specialconditions—to be unable to drive away crows (that is, to be too young), to beill, to be beset by suffering and the like, and (4) lack of beauty—to have adefective body, such as one with blond hair (that is, an albino) or mutilatedarms, or to belong to a deficient caste, such as the outcastes.Ordination must be taken in three stages—layperson, novice, and full ordination.None may be taken before the last has been fully received. In the former twostages of ordination (that is, lay and novice vows), at the third of theritual’s three recitations—refuge, personal affirmation, and others’acceptance—the vows of laypersons or novice arise immediately on completion ofthe personal affirmation with the words, “as a layperson” or “as a novice.”The latter stage, full ordination, depends upon the experience of the monasticcommunity’s basic procedures. Ordination is received by repeating the actionrecitation three times. In the course of these three, the words until “I will .. .” (Tib. chi-té) constitute the essence recitation; until “I request . . .”(Tib. sol-na), the action recitation; and until “for that purpose . . .” (Tib.dé’i lé-du), the performance recitation. The vows arise in the postulant’s beingimmediately after the completion of the action recitation.How to Keep the Vows Taken [E]This section has two parts: (1) vows for laypersons and (2) vows forrenunciants.Vows for Laypersons [1]This section has two parts: (1) temporary discipline and (2) sustaineddiscipline.Temporary Discipline for Laypersons [a]The temporary fasting vows have eight aspects:The four main vows—aspects concerned with ethical conduct;Renunciation of intoxicants—an aspect concerned with conscientiousness;Renunciation of seats that are large or high, dancing and wearing garlands,And eating after the noon meal—three aspects of disciplined conduct.Temporary fasting vows have eight aspects, of which four concern ethicalconduct: renunciation of killing, renunciation of taking what was not given,renunciation of impure conduct, and renunciation of telling lies. One aspectconcerns conscientiousness: renunciation of grain alcohol, distilled alcohol,intoxication, and circumstances of immodesty. Three aspects concern disciplinedconduct: renunciation of dancing, and related acts—dancing, song, or playingmusic; and wearing garlands and related attire—garlands, perfume, jewelry, ormake-up; the second of these three, renunciation of seats that are large orhigh; and renunciation of eating after the noon meal.Since these vows are kept for a day at a time, not permanently, only seven truekinds of individual liberation vows are counted.Sustained Discipline for Laypersons [b]Lay practitioners who maintain the three refugesRenounce three things and practice three things.Among five acts, four principal acts can be renounced—to kill, to steal,wrongful sexual conduct, and to lie;And a supplementary act—to take intoxicants.One, two, three, or five of these can be renounced.To do so represents, respectively, “one part,” “some parts,” “most,” and“complete” conduct.To renounce all impure (that is, sexual) activity constitutes the “pure-livinglayperson’s” vows.To sustain these eight vows permanently constitutes the “venerable layperson’s”vows.Lay practitioners who maintain refuge in the three jewels renounce three things:homage or offerings to other gods, harming sentient beings, and closefriendships with non-Buddhists. They train in three practices: respect towardeven a fragment of a sacred image or a clay mold (Tib. tsa-tsa), even a letteror half a letter of the written word, and a person wearing even a patch oforange cloth.Among five acts, four principal acts can be renounced: to take life, to takewhat has not been given, to engage in wrongful sexual conduct due to desire, andto lie. One constitutes a supplementary vow: to abstain from drinkingintoxicants.To renounce one act (that is, to take one vow) constitutes the vow of “alayperson who maintains one part of the conduct.” To renounce two, “some parts”;three, “most parts”; five, “complete conduct.”To renounce all impure (that is, sexual) activity constitutes a “pure-livinglayperson.” To keep the eight aspects (mentioned in the last section as“temporary discipline”) as a sustained discipline for as long as you liveconstitutes “venerable layperson’s” vows. Thus, there are six or seven kinds oflayperson. Renunciation of the remaining six of the ten corrupting actsconstitutes conducive renunciation.Vows for Renunciants [2]This section has three parts: (1) training for novices, (2) training for femalespiritual apprentices, and (3) downfalls for a fully ordained monk.Training for Novices [a]Novices renounce four principal acts—Taking life, taking what was not given, impure conduct, and lying;And six supplementary acts—taking intoxicants, dancing and related acts, wearinggarlands and related attire, resting on a high bed,Eating after the noon meal, and accepting gold and silver.When added to the first four, these comprise ten coarse acts.There are thirty fine points of training, thirteen permissions,And three pertinent offenses to be renounced.Novice monks and nuns renounce four principal acts: (1) taking human life, (2)stealing something of value, (3) impure conduct (that is, sexual penetration) inany of the three openings, and (4) lying concerning spiritual attainment.They renounce six supplementary acts: (5) taking intoxicants (a supplementaryrenunciation concerning conscientiousness), (6) dancing and related acts, (7)wearing garlands and related attire, (8) resting on a large or high bed, (9)eating after the noon meal, and (10) accepting gold and silver (these latterfive are supplementary aspects of disciplined conduct).When added to the first four, these comprise the ten coarse bases of training.Breaking one of the four principal vows of the novice incurs a fault equivalentto a defeating act for the fully ordained.The following twenty-six vows added to the four principal vows above constitutethirty fine points of training. Three aspects of killing pertain to the faultequivalent to the defeating act of taking life: (1) to kill animals, (2) tothrow grass that contains insects into water, and (3) to use water that containsinsects. Twelve pertain to lying: (4) unfounded accusation of another ordainedperson’s commission of a defeating act, (5) slightly founded accusation of adefeating act, (6) to cause a schism in the community, (7) to side with thosewho create such a schism, (8) to create disappointment among the lay community,(9) to consciously tell a lie, (10) to make accusations of favoritism, (11) tomake accusations against those among the monastic community responsible forservice, (12) to claim that another monk teaches the doctrine to gain a littlefood, (13) to make an unfounded claim that another monk has committed aremaining downfall, (15) to criticize and abandon the training, and (16) toconceal rice in order to receive more. The principal four plus these fifteen[sic] equal nineteen. (16) Renunciation of intoxicants makes twenty. Thefollowing must be counted separately: (17–19) three concerning dancing, and soon; (20–22) three concerning garlands, and so on; and (23, 24) two concerninglarge or high beds. The final two are (25) a prohibition against eating afterthe noon meal, and (26) a prohibition against accepting gold or silver. Thus,there are thirty in all.Ngari Penchen lists the thirteen permissions:Thirteen acts are without fault for novices due to permissions granted:(1) To keep extra robes, (2) to keep an extra begging bowl, (3) to be withoutthe robes,(4) To till the soil, (5) to touch precious objects, (6) to touch fire,(7) To eat again after one has finished eating, (8) to climb trees, (9) to cuttrees,(10) To eat food not formally offered and accepted, (11) to urinate or defecateon a heap of green grass,(12) To eat stored food, and (13) to destroy seeds.Apart from these, a novice follows the same rules as the fully ordained.Included in the permission to keep, the novice is permitted to store cloth forone month;Included in the permission to be without, the novice is permitted to be withoutthe robes in a monastery;And, included in the permission to save and store, the novice is permitted tosave and store.If “keeping” in the first line of this quotation is considered to cover bothrobes and begging bowl, thirteen acts are without fault.Three offenses must be guarded against after renunciant vows have been taken:(1) not relinquishing the signs (that is, clothing) of householder life, (2) notwearing the signs of renunciant life, and (3) holding the preceptor in contempt.Training for Female Spiritual Apprentices [b]Female spiritual apprentices must renounce six principal acts—To travel alone, to swim, to touch an adult male person,To sit together with an adult male, to match-make, and to conceal their faults;And six related ones—to keep gold, to shave their pubic hair,To till the soil, to eat food that has not been formally offered and accepted,To eat stored food, and to cut grass.Vishakhadeva states:Six principal rules have been determinedFor female spiritual apprentices:Do not travel alone,Do not swim across a river,Do not touch an adult male person,Do not sit together with an adult male,Do not conceal your faults,Do not match-make.These are the six related rules;Do not commit any of them:Do not accept the highest quality material (that is, gold),Do not shave your pubic hair,Do not till the soil,Do not cut grass and other plants,Do not eat food not formally offered and accepted,Do not eat stored food.Seven acts are without fault:To keep an extra robe or begging bowl, to be without the robes, to touch fire,To eat again, to destroy seeds,To urinate or defecate on green grass,To climb trees.Acts That Constitute Downfalls for Fully Ordained Monks [c]This section has six [sic] parts: (1) four principal defeating acts, (2)thirteen remaining downfalls, (3) thirty downfalls that require relinquishment,(4) ninety downfalls that only require confession, (5) four acts to beacknowledged individually, (6) one hundred and twelve reprehensible acts, and(7) vows for a fully ordained nun.Four Principal Defeating Acts [i]This section has four parts: (1) impure conduct, (2) taking what is not given,(3) killing, and (4) lying concerning spiritual attainment.Impure Conduct [A)]The discipline for fully ordained monks comprises two hundred and fifty-threeregulations.They are divided into five classes of downfalls.The first class is the four principal defeating acts;The first of these is impure conduct.Its basis one of the three openings of another’s body;The intention is to satisfy desire; the act is the movement of the penis; thecompletion is satisfaction.The discipline of fully ordained monks comprises two hundred and fifty-threeregulations.Among these, the original context for the defeating act of impure conduct is asfollows: Thirteen years after the Teacher attained manifest, completeenlightenment, in the district of Parggi, an individual, the fully ordained monkSudinna, fell under the power of the mental affliction of desire and engaged inimpure conduct with his former partner. Based on that event, the Buddhadesignated this regulation.An act has four aspects: its basis, intention, act, and completion.(1) Concerning the basis—the object upon which this act depends—is a part of thebody that can create the pleasure of sexual intercourse. To be complete, any ofthe following are considered sufficient: it must be half a body or more, whichincludes any of the three physical openings that represent the birth canal—themouth, anus, or vagina—that is undamaged and can serve for intercourse. Theactive support for this act is a healthy penis capable of engaging inintercourse.(2) The intention is the wish to experience the pleasure of touch, motivated byattachment, and an absence of modesty or fear.(3) The act is to touch a recipient of the opening of another’s body with thepenis and to penetrate it.(4) The completion is for the monk’s penis to have crossed the boundary of anyone of the three openings for intercourse and to have gained satisfaction—toexperience physical pleasure, and to have mentally identified with it.When these four aspects are complete, the act becomes an actual defeating act ofimpure conduct. Vishakhadeva states:If the jewel passes beyond the labia, the teeth, or the skin,This constitutes a defeating act.If it remains outside, depending on the degree,This can constitute either a serious act or a remaining downfall reparable bythe monastic community.Taking What Is Not Given [B)]The second defeating act is to take what has not been given.The basis of theft is another’s wealth; the intention is the wish to make it themonk’s own;The act is to steal a valuable object.The completion of the act is to have thought that he has obtained it. At thatmoment, the vow is broken.The original context for this regulation occurred in Rajgir: the fully ordainedmonk Dhaniya stole wood from King Ajatashatru, to use it to build a house. Basedon the event, the Buddha designated this regulation.Among this act’s four aspects, (1) the basis is the object of theft—a thingclaimed by a human being with whom the monk’s wealth is not shared. The materialmust not be such trifles as food or objects from charnel grounds. To cause adefeating act, the specific object must be of an equal value to the measure setforth in the Buddha’s time, regardless of the region or time; such value dependson both the object and the prevailing social circumstances (that is, times offamine, for example). The measure is stated in Fifty Stanzas on Novice Vows:If one quarter of a kasharpana is stolen,That theft breaks the monastic code.Thus, the measure is the value of one quarter kasharpana. In India, calculationwas usually based on the weight of ashes of burnt shells, therefore calculationfor other places and times must be based on that measure: twenty shells equalone kakani; four kakani, one mashaka—eighty shells; twenty mashaka, onekasharpana—one thousand, six hundred shells.Thus, one quarter kasharpana equaled four hundred shells; or five mashaka.Although, in general, the relation between mashaka and kasharpana cannot beprecisely determined, the definition of one kasharpana as five mashaka is anaverage taken from The Root Discourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct.If this value is calculated for gold, what is called a kakani equals a jequiritybean (kanchi in Sanskrit; maru go-nak in Tibetan); four of them equal a mashaka,which equals two sé (a Tibetan measure) of gold. Five of them equal a quarterkasharpana, or ten sé. In this country of Tibet, we can designate the value ofan object the theft of which constitutes stealing at five loads of barley, sincein a period without famine, twenty sé of gold equals one central Tibetan zho,worth ten loads of barley.(2) The intention is the wish to steal wealth for the monk’s own use, in theknowledge that it belongs to a human being, or with some doubt concerning thatfact.(3) The act is to undertake with physical or verbal endeavor the theft of anobject that has the value mentioned above.(4) The completion of the act is the arising of the attitude that the objectstolen has been taken from its owner and has come into the monk’s possession byhis own hand, or through his encouragement to others to steal, or by any othermeans.Killing [C)]The third defeating act is taking human life.The basis of killing is another human being.The intention is the wish to kill the individual the monk knows is present.The act is to begin the act of murder. Its completion is achieved when the otherdies before the monk.The original context for the rule occurred in Parggi, where many fully ordainedmonks meditated upon the state of revulsion. They came to loathe their bodies’impurities and requested the mendicant Migalandika to kill them. Based on theevent, the Buddha designated this regulation.Of this act’s four aspects, (1) the basis is a human being or a human being infetal development,18 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st18] endowed with a stream ofbeing other than the monk’s own, whom one unmistakably intends to kill.(2) The intention is the perception of the presence of the intended murdervictim, which inspires the sustained motivation to kill.(3) The act is to begin the act of murder with poison or weapons, and so on, andfor the monk to not restrain himself.(4) The completion is achieved when at that time or at another time the intendedvictim’s life ceases before the killer’s, a monk. The Three Hundred Stanzas forNovices states:Apart from a dream, whoever is of sound mind and has received the designatedtraining,Knows another human being to be a human,And with the thought to kill him or her, attempts to do so without mistake,Has destroyed the vow when the victim dies.This does not only apply to killing by the monk’s own hand, but equally includesinciting others to kill, or verbal expression of joy at a murder, if such eventscontribute to the death. For example, if many fully ordained monks discuss anddecide among themselves that someone should be murdered and one of them carriesout the killing, the defeating act is shared by them all. The Treasury ofObserved Phenomena states:Those united in war or similar situationsShare the same karma as the one who acts.Lying Concerning Spiritual Attainments [D)]The fourth defeating act is to lie concerning spiritual attainment.The basis of lying is a human being who understands the meaning of the monk’swords;The intention is to wish to speak in order to change the other’s perception;The act is to claim clairvoyance or other abilities, although the monk has none;The act is completed when the other understands the lie.The original context for the rule occurred in Vaishali, where fishermen, fivehundred fully ordained monks who renounced home-life, told lies concerning theirspiritual attainment. Based on that event, the Buddha designated thisregulation.Of the four aspects, (1) the basis is the auditor of the monk’s speech, a humanbeing endowed with a mind other than the monk’s own, who has the five bases forthis designation: he or she knows how to speak, understands the words’ meaning,has a sound mind, is not a neuter, and is not a hermaphrodite.The content of the pertinent speech is the claim to have attained any worldly ortranscendent quality above those of the desire realm, from the level of thefirst exalted meditative state of the gods to enlightenment. Vishakhadevastates:In this context, the five obscurations19 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st19]Are understood as common human characteristics.Their dissipation is considered to be superior spiritual attributes.(2) The intention is the wish to tell a lie to alter another’s perception.(3) The act is to claim clairvoyance or other abilities that make one differentfrom others, although the monk has no such collection of qualities. In words ofsix characteristics, the lie concerning higher spiritual attainment must bespoken without obvious pride. This can also be committed by inciting others tospeak for the monk. The six characteristics of the words are that they arespeech, the monk’s own, related to him, spoken unmistakably, spoken clearly, andspoken perceptibly.(4) The act is completed when the other (that is, any listener) understands.In the case of the commission of any of the four acts just described, if any ofthe four aspects of a defeating act’s specific causes as listed is incomplete,the act constitutes a serious offense. If all aspects are complete, itconstitutes an actual defeating act, since the act’s negative influences havedestroyed any antidote that might repair the violation and have defeated thefully ordained monk who committed it. Therefore, the omniscient Teacher calledthese “the four defeating acts.” The Discourse of Individual Liberation states:As it has been, so it will be: Fully ordained monks who have committed any ofthose downfalls have been defeated. They are thereby not permitted to remain inresidence with other fully ordained monks, nor to share living conditions withthem.Thirteen Remaining Downfalls [ii]The thirteen remaining downfalls are to ejaculate, to touch a female out ofdesire,To speak lustful words to a woman, to extol service for intercourse, tomatch-make,To construct an oversized house, to construct a large house for himself,Baseless accusation, slightly substantiated accusation,To create a division within the monastic community, to side with those who splitthe monastic community,To disappoint laypersons, and to voice discontentment with the commands of themonastic assembly.Because the reparation of the following offenses depends upon a formal meetingof the monastic community and the remaining vows of complete purity are leftintact, they are called “the remaining community downfalls.” Theircharacteristic is any downfall that contradicts the monastic code determined fora fully ordained monk; these violations are given the name “remaining” becausethey can be purified by reparations.To classify these thirteen vows, seven concern desire (five concern desiretoward sentient beings; two, toward external objects); two concern harm towardothers; and four concern community directives.(1) Ejaculation: The original context for this and the next three downfalls(including number 4, to extol service) occurred in Shravasti and were firstdesignated in relation to Udayin.The basis of this downfall is any part of the monk’s own or another’s body,apart from the three paths for intercourse; the intention is the wish toejaculate; the act is contact with and stimulation of the penis; the act iscomplete upon ejaculation of semen and the experience of pleasure.(2) Grasping: The basis of this downfall is the suitable body of a female humanbeing; the intention is the wish to touch her out of desire; the act is to touchher body or even a part of it, such as her hair, without having restrainedhimself; and the act is complete with the experience of pleasure.(3) To speak lustful words: The basis of this downfall is any appropriate femalehuman being who comprehends language; the intention is with desire; the act isto say clearly to her at that time any actual term for sexual intercourse; andthe act is complete when she has understood.(4) To extol service: The basis of this downfall is a female human being; theintention is with desire; the act is, in order to have intercourse, to state,“The best kind of service you can offer to a fully ordained monk, such as me, isthe service of sexual intercourse,” or, if the woman makes the statement, toassent. The act is complete when the woman has understood.(5) To match-make: This rule was first designated in Shravasti in relation tothe group of six monks. The basis of this downfall, what must be renounced, isthe persons meeting—any male and female that can meet, apart from the monkhimself; the intention is the wish that they have intercourse; the act is tohave carried or to arrange for three messages to pass between them tomatch-make; the completion occurs when, after they meet, their genitals unite.(6) To construct an oversized house: This rule, and the one concerning a largehouse, were first designated by the Teacher in Kaushambi, in relation to thegroup of six monks. The basis of the downfall is a location where there are manyinsects, a place where ownership is disputed, or which is dangerous; to searchassiduously for materials from others; and to not have received authorizationfrom the monastic community. The intention is the monk’s wish to build a housefor himself; the act is to build, or to have others build, a house measuringover eighteen cubits long and ten and a half cubits wide; the act is completewhen the walls and roof are finished.(7) To construct a large house: The basis of this downfall is to construct ahouse greater than for four persons. In this case, the aspects of searching forthe materials and exceeding the measure are unnecessary. Otherwise, it is thesame as the last rule.(8) Baseless accusation: This rule, and the next, that of slightly substantiatedaccusation, were first designated in Rajgir, in relation to Mettiya andBhummajaka. The basis of this downfall is another fully ordained monk; the actis to make a clear accusation that he committed any of the four principaldownfalls, although the monk’s claims lack the basis of having seen the act,having heard proof of it, or material evidence; the act is complete when themonk’s words have been understood.(9) Slightly substantiated accusation: The basis of this downfall is a fullyordained monk; the act is on the basis of a slight infraction, to accuse a monkof a principal downfall through indirect insinuation; the act is complete whenthe monk’s words are understood.(10) To create a division within the monastic community: This rule was firstdesignated in Rajgir, in relation to Devadatta. The basis of the downfall is themonastic community, apart from the monk himself, who live within the samedefined area. They become split, for example, over the monk’s nonconformistviews or conduct. The act is complete when, although the five preventive actionshave been undertaken, the monk persists after the third of three admonishments.The five preventive actions are giving a reminder, the monastic community’srequest, and three admonishments. The seriousness of the downfall in these casesis after the first, each stage is a serious infraction; if the act is continuedafter the third admonishment, it is an actual remaining downfall. The followingthree downfalls follow the same pattern.Is this remaining downfall of creating dissension different from the act ofcreating a schism that constitutes an act of immediate fruition? There is adifference: In the case of the act of immediate fruition, the monastic communitymust become definitely divided and the person responsible for the schism mustdefinitely be a fully ordained monk. In the case of a remaining downfall,although the individual proves unable to provoke dissension in the community, heundertook that act and persisted even after the five preventive actions had beencompleted. That much is sufficient for the downfall to be incurred. Moreover, inthe case of a remaining downfall, the person responsible for the dissension doesnot necessarily have to be a fully ordained monk, as a fully ordained nun whocommits a similar dissension incurs the same remaining downfall.(11) To side with those who split the monastic community: This rule was firstdesignated in Rajgir, in relation to the four fully ordained monk companions ofDevadatta, including Kokalika. The basis of the downfall is any fully ordainedmonk who has begun to create dissension in the monastic community; the intentionis the wish to side with that monk; the act is to side with him; and the act iscomplete when the monk persists in doing so after the five preventive actionshave been completed.(12) To disappoint laypersons: This rule was first designated in Shravasti, inrelation to Punnabbasu and Assaji. This downfall applies to any fully ordainedmonk banished from a monastic community for having caused laypersonsdisappointment toward a monk’s negative behavior inconsistent with the training,such as to joke, play, eat, or drink in the company of women. If the monk thencriticizes the community that banished him, claiming they have four faults(desire, fear, anger, and stupidity), this downfall is incurred when he persistsafter the five preventive actions have been completed.(13) To vocalize discontent with the commands given by the monastic assembly toencourage reparation of vows: This rule was first designated in Kaushambi, inrelation to Channa. It applies to a fully ordained monk who has been formallyadmonished and is able to understand that fact. To encourage him in higherethical conduct, the monastic community proposes acts to repair the training.The monk, discontented with the command, replies, “Whatever we do, whether anennobling act or wrongdoing, you should not say anything at all to us.” Thedownfall is incurred if the monk persists after the five preventive actions havebeen completed.Thirty Downfalls That Require Forfeiture [iii]The thirty downfalls for which the object that caused the downfall must beforfeited concern the robes, the mat, and the begging bowl—ten for each.This class of regulation is literally called “forfeiture downfalls” because theinfraction is repaired through forfeiture of the object that caused the downfalland if it is not repaired, the ripening of the act causes falling into themiserable existences. The first set of ten is as follows:(1) The forfeiture of keeping: The next three regulations, which concernkeeping, being without, and storing, were first designated in Vaishali, inrelation to many monks. This regulation applies to an individual notparticipating in the ritual for distribution of robes during a monsoon seasonretreat, and who owns a piece of cloth for his own use, sufficient in size tocover the three circles (that is, the waist and the two knees). If the monk hashis own three consecrated robes, or in the case in which he has not, if he hasno expectation of an additional set of robes, this may apply to a cubit-lengthof cloth. Whether through their own force (the cloth has not been consecratedwith its name or any other designation) or through the force ofcontamination-by-association (the cloth was consecrated but has beencontaminated), the infraction is incurred at the first light of dawn on theeleventh day.This does not only apply to additional clothing: If the monk has of his ownaccord, and for his temporary use, gained cloth, it must be consecrated with thename of any of the thirteen articles of livelihood during the next ten days. Asis said,However, if the monk previously owned consecrated clothing, he must sincerelyintend to give the latterly gained cloth to someone else or he must have itconsecrated, designated as a remainder or as a necessary article. Moreover, mustthe unconsecrated cloth produce the requirement of forfeiture by its own force,by having been kept for over ten days? No: When a monk keeps unconsecrated clothfor a period of one to nine days, if he obtains a second cloth, the firstcloth’s date of keeping contaminates the second’s, in that the extent to whichhe kept the first cloth must also be counted for that of later cloth. If he hasyet another, the unconsecrated cloth contaminates it as well.Therefore, as is said,Can the fault be prevented just by consecration? It might be said that thisfault can be prevented if both former and latter items are consecrated, or ifthe former is consecrated before contamination-through-association. However, ifthe former is not consecrated, the latter is contaminated even when consecrated,by the force of the former item.(2) To be without the robes: This regulation applies to an individual who hasnot received permission to be without the outer cape and who is notparticipating in the distribution of robes. It is incurred if a monk stays apartfrom the vicinity (except in the case of a dangerous, isolated place) where hehas left the three consecrated robes or any part of them. The infraction isincurred at dawn of the second day.(3) To store for one month: This regulation applies to a monk not participatingin the ritual for distribution of robes, who does not own one of the threerobes. It is incurred if the monk, with the wish to make an extra set of robes,keeps a piece of cloth for robes at least one cubit in length but not sufficientto cover the three circles. This can apply to unconsecrated cloth or consecratedcloth contaminated by being kept with other cloth. Thus either on its own orthrough contamination, the stored cloth is considered to have created thedownfall after thirty days, at dawn of the thirty-first.(4) To request laundry service: This regulation was first designated inVaishali, in relation to Udayin. This infraction concerns a monk who requests afully ordained nun, with whom he has no family relation through sevengenerations, to wash any article of his three robes or his old mat. It isincurred when she washes even a part of those items.(5) To accept cloth: The next six regulations, until that of accepting money(number 10), were first designated in Vaishali, in relation to Upananda. Thisinfraction concerns a monk who owns the three robes, who begs, from a fullyordained nun who is not his relative, cloth that measures at least enough tocover the three circles. It is incurred when such cloth comes into hispossession.(6) To beg for cloth: This infraction is incurred if a monk who already owns thethree robes begs, from a layperson who is not his relative, cloth that measuresat least enough to cover the three circles and he receives such cloth.(7) Inappropriate begging: This infraction concerns a monk without the threerobes who begs from a layperson who is not his relative. While he might be givenmuch cloth, it is appropriate for him to accept only enough for the upper andlower robes. The downfall is incurred if he accepts more than that amount.(8) To calculate the article begged: This infraction concerns a monk whocalculates what he begs, from a layperson who is not his relative, saying,“Gather here the cloth you wish to give me.” The infraction is incurred when,before the formal offering and acceptance, the monk tells from memory the priceand length he has calculated and then receives that amount.(9) To calculate articles begged separately: This infraction concerns a monk whohears that a layman or a laywoman is considering making separate offerings of apiece or a lot of cloth to him. The infraction is incurred when, to test whetherthe offering will be made or not, the monk tells from memory the price andlength he has calculated and then receives that amount.Although it has been said that these two cases apply when the monk receivessomething better than what was intended, the actual presentation in thediscourses states clearly that the fault lies in accepting the object beforeformal offering and acceptance.(10) To accept money in exchange: This infraction concerns offerings receivedfrom any of three laypersons: patrons, their messengers, or their attendants. Ifa patron through a messenger offers a monk such substances unsuitable for thecost of cloth, such as gold or silver, the monk must refuse, saying, “I cannotaccept this.” If the messenger then gives this to the monk’s own attendant,asking him to buy cloth, and if the monk directly encourages his attendant threetimes to do so, or if he sees him three times and says nothing as the attendantundertakes that task, a fault (but not this downfall) is incurred until the timethe cloth is bought. This forfeiture downfall is incurred after that point, whenthe monk acquires the cloth.The second ten concerning the mat are as follows: (1) This infraction isincurred when a monk makes a mat with expensive material, such as silk.(2) This infraction is incurred when a monk makes a mat entirely of black wool,where black wool is rare.(3) This infraction is incurred when a monk makes a mat of more than two partsblack wool. In these three cases, whether the mat with a lining has been newlymade by himself or others, the infraction is incurred by simply spreading such amat.(4) The six year regulation: This infraction is incurred when a monk, inpossession of a former mat, within six years from the making of the former mat,has made a second mat with a lining, without having gained permission to do so.(5) The thumb-size regulation: When a monk is in possession of an old mat whenhe makes a new one, he must include in it at least as much material from the oldone as the measure of a thumb of the Joyful Buddha (equal to a human’shalf-cubit). The infraction is incurred when the monk uses a mat that has notincluded such a piece.(6) To carry wool on a path: This and the next four regulations (until number10, bartering) were first designated in relation to the group of six monks. Thisinfraction is incurred when a monk, out of attachment, carries a large load ofwool or other items he owns beyond the distance of an earshot during one day.Concerning this, permission is given for such transport over less than threeleagues in the case of aiding a novice who has no help to carry his load. Inthat case, the infraction is incurred after a further earshot or, if the otherhas a helper for the carrying, when one goes beyond an earshot from the point ofdeparture.(7) To request laundry service: This infraction concerns a monk who requests afully ordained nun, who is not his relative, to wash the wool, to comb it out,or to dye it. The infraction is incurred when she carries out his request.(8) To touch precious objects: This infraction concerns a monk who, out ofattachment, touches or induces another to touch inappropriate precious objects,such as gold or silver, that have not been deemed appropriate, and which have nofault such as having been wasted, to make the object becomes his.There are three ways an object may be appropriate to touch: when the monkconsiders the object as the patron’s own; when the object is promised to belongto the attendant; or by consecration.(9) Overt commerce: This infraction concerns a monk who, out of desire for gain,overtly trades merchandise, such as jewels, or makes loans with interest, withlaypersons who are not relatives. The infraction is incurred when he acquiresand accepts profit from the trade, equaling the value of a cubit’s length ofcloth.(10) Bartering: This infraction concerns a monk who, with desire for gain,trades with laypersons who are not relatives any merchandise, apart from jewels.The infraction is incurred when he acquires any profit by buying in times ofplenty and selling in times of want.The third ten concerning the begging bowl and other possessions are as follows:(1) To keep a begging bowl: This regulation was first designated in relation tothe group of six monks. This infraction is incurred by keeping a proper beggingbowl that has not been consecrated, or one that has been consecrated butcontaminated by having been kept with another. The infraction is incurred atdawn of the eleventh day.(2) To search for another begging bowl: This and the next three regulations(until number 5, “to take back”) were first designated in relation to Upananda.This infraction concerns a monk who owns and uses a begging bowl (of correctmaterial, shape, and color, and which holds at least nine double handfuls aftera thumb-sized rim), who requests another from a person who is not his relative.It is incurred when he receives one. If the one received is not consecrated andexceeds the time limit, this incurs the previous infraction.(3) To request weaving: This infraction concerns a monk who requests, or hasothers request, a weaver who is not his relative to weave cloth for him withoutremuneration. It is incurred when he receives it.(4) To improve the weave: This infraction concerns woven cloth offered to a monkby a person not his relative. If, before the patron offers the cloth, the monkasks for cloth of better quality than what was intended, the infraction isincurred when he receives it.(5) To take back something given: This infraction concerns a monk who takes backarticles, such as cloth or a begging bowl, that he previously gave another monkof similar views and clothing. It is incurred when the other is separated fromthat article.(6) Distribution of offerings: This regulation and the next (number 7, to bewithout the robes in isolation) were first designated in Vaishali in relation tothe group of six monks. This infraction is incurred when the offerings made tothe community participating in the monsoon season retreat are appropriated asthe monk’s own, are distributed to the others during the retreat period, or arenot distributed to the others on the day after the lifting of the restrictions.These constitute the three infractions concerning early or late distribution.However, as is said in The Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct,There are five exceptional circumstances: in the case of sickness, for the sick,in the case of death, for the dead, and for departure.Thus, before the lifting of restrictions, the offerings made by patrons whosesituations conform to the exceptional circumstances can be distributed for thesereasons to each monk within ten days of the completion of the monsoon seasonretreat without this constituting a fault. This regulation does not apply tosuch cases as the monk who gives instruction during the retreat, and to theportion used for care of the sick.(7) To be without the robes in isolation: Permission has been granted for fullyordained monks who live in isolation to be without their consecrated three robesfor a period up to six days. However, although this is without fault, if nodanger exists, this infraction is incurred at dawn on the seventh day.(8) The large cotton rain cloth: This regulation was first designated inVaishali in relation to many monks. Regardless of whether a monk has promised toenter the early or later summer retreat, when a monk searches for and acquiresthe large cotton summer cloth one month before the retreat, he incurs theearly-searching downfall that requires forfeiture, or when he keeps it one halfmonth after the lifting of the restrictions, he incurs the late-keeping downfallthat requires forfeiture.(9) To divert offerings: This regulation was first designated in Vaishali, inrelation to Upananda. This infraction concerns any offering made by a laypersonto the monastic community or any belonging of another fully ordained monk, suchas clothes or a begging bowl. The infraction is incurred when a monk divertssuch an article and then appropriates it as his own.(10) To store: This regulation was first designated in Rajgir, in relation tothose in residence with exalted Anatapindada. What is actually expressed in thediscourses in relation to storing medicine for seven days is merely an example.Here, this infraction is incurred by keeping any of the four medicines beyondits appropriate time.The appropriate time for each is as follows: for any of the four medicines thathas not been consecrated, each must be formally given and received during one ofthe four periods and it expires during the next. For example, if formallyoffered and received in the morning, it expires at noon. Similarly, theafternoon offerings expire at sunset; those of sunset, at the end of theevening; and those of the evening, at the end of the night.For consecrated substances, four possibilities apply. First, even thoughconsecration is unnecessary during periods appropriate for eating, this appliesto medicine formally offered and accepted in the morning, which can be keptuntil the afternoon. Second, medicine appropriate for a period is consecrated inthe morning and expires at the end of the night. Third, those consecrated forseven days expire at the dawn of the eighth day. Fourth, medicine for a lifetimeis consecrated for a period until a sickness is cured; however, it can be kepteven after the monk is free from the illness. Thus this can be considered asconsecrated for as long as the monk lives, and therefore cannot incur thisinfraction of storing.When these thirty forfeiture downfalls are repaired, the object that incurredthe infraction must be totally forfeited, as in the case of taking backsomething given and searching for a second begging bowl.

These differences are due to theTeacher’s cubit being three times the average length.Four Acts to Be Acknowledged Individually [v]The four acts to be acknowledged individually are to beg for food, to eat foodserved with favoritism,To beg in spite of restrictions, and to not watch the forest but to eat.This category is called “to be acknowledged individually” since they must beacknowledged separately with words of regret. The first regulation was firstdesignated in relation to Upananda; the other three, in relation to the group ofsix monks.(1) To receive food from a fully ordained nun: This regulation concerns a monkwho in a town, in the vicinity, or on a road, begs from a fully ordained nun,who is not his relative, food that she herself has prepared for herself at theappropriate time. It is incurred when he eats the food.(2) To not refuse but to eat food served with favoritism by a fully ordainednun: This regulation concerns three or more fully ordained monks invited by alayperson in whose home a fully ordained nun directs the service. When, insteadof following rank, she orders with favoritism, “Give to this one,” and the monkin question does not refuse and all the monks subsequently eat, all of themincur the fault of this act to be acknowledged individually.(3) To forgo the training and to enter a home: This act concerns a community’sconsensual decision through formal procedures to formulate a rule to not beg forfood at certain homes due to restrictions and special circumstances. This faultis incurred when a monk subject to that regulation begs at the appropriate timefrom that home things other than what is said to be permissible, such as leaves.It is incurred when he eats the food.(4) To not watch the forest: This act concerns a monk designated by thecommunity to keep an eye on the forest when the community residence is locatedin a dangerous place of isolation, more than one earshot from a town. The monkincurs this fault when he thinks, “What’s the point of guarding the communityand the patron from harm?” and does not watch the forest but begs food from ahousehold at an appropriate time. It is incurred when he eats the food.One Hundred and Twelve Reprehensible Acts [vi]The one hundred and twelve reprehensible acts include ten concerning wearingclothes—Seven concern the lower robe; three, the upper robe.Twenty concern behavior when walking to homes; nine, how to sit;Eight, acceptance of food; twenty-one, eating food;Fourteen, handling the begging bowl;Twenty-six, teaching; three, practice of hygiene; and one, movement.In total, there are two hundred and fifty-three vows for fully ordained monks.These acts have the nature of minor offenses so are reprehensible acts. The onehundred and twelve reprehensible acts have nine categories:The first category concerns wearing clothes; monks must train to avoid these tenmistakes. Seven concern the wearing of the lower robe: (1) It should not be wornunevenly round, with its upper and lower extremities uneven in height. (2) Itshould not be worn too high, reaching the knees in length. (3) It should not beworn too low, touching the ankles in length. (4) It should not be worn with along overhanging piece of material in front, like an elephant’s trunk. (5) Itshould not be worn with the belt tied upward, like a palm leaf. (6) It shouldnot be worn with the belt sticking out in the middle, like a sack of grain. (7)It should not be worn over the belt with the upper part uneven, like a cobra’shood.Three concern the wearing of the upper robe: (8) The cloak of patches and theupper robe should not be worn unevenly round. (9) They should not be worn toolong. (10) They should not be worn too short.The second category concerns behavior when traveling. The following twentyfaults should not be committed. Instead, when walking to visit homes, monksshould learn to walk in a peaceful and restrained manner. It is a reprehensibleact (1) to not mindfully restrain body and speech; (2) to not wear the upper andlower robes properly; (3) to make meaningless sounds; (4) to allow the eyes towander right or left; (5) to look farther than a yoke’s breadth in front; (6) tocover the head with clothes; (7) to hoist up the lower robe so that the genitalsare exposed; (8) to cover both shoulders with the upper robe; (9) to cross thearms over the nape of the neck; (10) to cross the arms behind the back; (11) toskip while walking; (12) to walk with overly long steps, extending and pullingback the knees; (13) to lift the heels and thus to walk on the front part of thefoot; (14) to walk crouched, on the heels; (15) to walk with the hands on thehips, elbows extended; (16) to walk crookedly, twisting the body; (17) to walkwaving the hands; (18) to walk shaking and twisting the head; (19) to walk withthe shoulders touching another’s; and (20) to walk holding another’s hand.The third category concerns how to sit on a seat. The following nine faults ofsitting must be renounced. In a home, a monk should sit with his legs folded inmeditation posture. In a layperson’s home, it is a reprehensible act (1) to sitin a seat not designated by the patron; (2) to sit down without checking whetheror not insects are on the seat; (3) to sit down heavily, striking the posterior;(4) to stretch and cross the legs; (5) to cross the legs at the thighs; (6) tosit with one ankle on the other; (7) to tuck the legs under the seat, like theMongolian sitting style; (8) to spread the legs in different directions; and (9)to sit with the genitals exposed.The fourth category concerns receiving food. A monk should learn to renouncethese eight faults in receiving food. In any place, such as a town or a temple,it is a reprehensible act (1) to not accept food politely, in a mannerinconsistent with monastic discipline; (2) to accept as much food as willentirely cover the brim and the mouth of the bowl; (3) to take rice andvegetables in unequal measure; (4) to accept food out of strict order of rank;(5) to accept while not paying attention to the begging bowl but to look to theside; (6) to extend the bowl before the food arrives; (7) with the wish formore, to conceal the food already received, then to again present the bowl; and(8) to present the monk’s bowl holding it higher than others’ bowls.The fifth category concerns eating food. A monk should learn to renounce thesetwenty-one faults in eating food. In any situation, it is a reprehensible act(1) to eat improperly in a manner inconsistent with the monastic code; (2) toeat too large mouthfuls; (3) to eat too small mouthfuls; (4) to not eatmoderately sized mouthfuls, in keeping with the monk’s own or common standards;(5) to open the mouth wide before the food reaches it; (6) to talk whilechewing; (7) while eating, to make tsuk-tsuk sounds when the food is sour; (8)to make chak-chak sounds when the food is sweet; (9) to make hu-hu sounds whenthe food is cold; (10) to make pu-pu sounds when the food is hot; (11) to extendthe tongue while eating; (12) to set apart one grain at a time of barley, orother grain, before eating it; (13) to criticize the food, by saying such thingsas, “The patron’s food is awful!” or “The food is sour!”; (14) to move amouthful of food from the right cheek to the left; (15) to make sounds with thepalate while eating; (16) to bite off what doesn’t fit in the mouth, like ananimal; (17) to lick off food stuck to the hands; (18) to lick the begging bowlor cups, and so on; (19) to shake off food stuck to the hands; (20) to tip backand forth a begging bowl containing food; and (21) to form the food into theshape of a replica of a religious monument, then to crush and eat it.The sixth category concerns the handling of the begging bowl. The following arethe fourteen points of training concerning the begging bowl: (1) do not examineanother’s begging bowl to disparage it; (2) do not touch the water containerwith food stuck to the hands; (3) do not throw water containing food, or otherthings, toward a fully ordained monk; (4) do not discard food and dirty washingwater in the house without asking the home owner; (5) do not place leftover foodin the begging bowl and leave it there; (6) do not place the begging bowlwithout a support on bare ground; (7) do not place the begging bowl by acrevice; (8) do not place the begging bowl at the top of a mountainsideprecipice; (9) do not place the begging bowl on the slope of a terrace; (10) donot wash the begging bowl by a crevice; (11) do not wash the begging bowl at aprecipice; (12) do not wash the begging bowl on the slope of a cliff; (13) donot wash the begging bowl while standing at a junction of paths; and (14) do notuse the begging bowl to draw water from a stream with a strong current.The seventh category concerns teaching the doctrine. Fully ordained monks mustnot teach in these twenty-six cases: (1) do not teach the doctrine if thelisteners, who are not sick, are seated, while the teacher stands; (2) do notteach those who are lying down; (3) do not teach if the listener’s seat is highand the teacher’s seat low; (4) do not teach those who walk in front if one isfollowing behind; (5) do not teach those who walk in the middle of the road ifone is walking on the side of the road; (6) do not teach those who have coveredheads when not sick; (7) do not teach those who have their clothes hoisted up;(8) do not teach those who have both shoulders covered by the upper robe; (9) donot teach those who have their arms crossed at the nape of the neck; (10) do notteach those who have their arms crossed behind the head; (11) do not teach thosewho have their hair gathered in a bun on the head; (12) do not teach thosewearing a hat; (13) do not teach those wearing an ornamental headdress; (14) donot teach those wearing garlands on the head; (15) do not teach those wearing aturban; (16) do not teach those riding an elephant; (17) do not teach thoseriding a horse; (18) do not teach those carried on a palanquin; (19) do notteach those riding a horse cart or other vehicles; (20) do not teach thosewearing shoes; (21) do not teach those holding a staff; (22) do not teach thosecarrying a parasol; (23) do not teach those carrying a club or other weapons;(24) do not teach those carrying a sword; (25) do not teach those carryingweapons, such as a bow and arrow; and (26) do not teach those wearing armor.However, teaching a listener who is ill does not incur any fault.The eighth category concerns practice of correct hygiene: (1) except if sick, donot defecate or urinate while standing; (2) unless one cannot find anotherplace, do not defecate, urinate, spit, discharge mucus, or vomit, and so on,into water; and (3) unless one cannot find another place, do not defecate,urinate, spit, discharge mucus, or vomit, and so on, onto green grass.The ninth category concerns movement. It has one point: except in cases ofdanger of harm by tigers, and so on, do not climb a tree to a height higher thanthat of a man.Thus, in total, there are two hundred and fifty-three vows for a fully ordainedmonk.Vows for Fully Ordained Nuns [vii]In brief, a fully ordained nun renounces eight defeating acts, twenty remainingdownfalls,Thirty-three downfalls that require forfeiture, one hundred and eighty simpledownfalls,Eleven acts to be acknowledged individually, and one hundred and twelvereprehensible acts—Three hundred and sixty-four regulations in all.In brief, a fully ordained nun renounces eight defeating acts, twenty remainingdownfalls, thirty-three downfalls that require forfeiture, one hundred andeighty simple downfalls, eleven acts to be acknowledged individually, and onehundred and twelve reprehensible acts—three hundred and sixty-four regulationsin all.The Life That Is the Support for the Vows’ Arising [F]The life that is the support for the vows is a male or female human beingFrom one of three continents. Non-Buddhists, those who have committed one of theacts of immediate fruition,Persons without genitals, or persons from the continent of Unpleasant Sound areineligible.The life that constitutes the support for the vows is a male or female humanbeing from one of three continents—the southern, eastern, or western.These persons are ineligible to receive the vows: non-Buddhists; those who havecommitted one of the acts of immediate fruition; neuters—persons with nogenitals (literally, “without the possibility for sexual intercourse”); the fivekinds of asexual persons (persons born with no genitals, those whose genderchanges each fortnight, those repulsed by sexual relations, the jealous—that is,persons of either gender who wish to have sexual relations but are physicallyincapable of doing so—and those whose genitals are impaired); persons withphysical sexual dysfunction, such as those who have both male and femalegenitals or persons whose gender has changed three times; and persons from thecontinent of Unpleasant Sound.How the Vows Are Violated [G]The vows are terminated by offering back the training, by death, by change ofgender,By the arising of wrong views, by the commission of one of the principaldownfalls,By the decline of the sacred Buddhist doctrine, or by other events.The vows are terminated by offering back the training, by death, by change ofgender, by the arising of wrong views, by the commission of one of the principaldownfalls, by the decline of the sacred Buddhist doctrine, or by other events.How to Restore the Vows [H]If a defeating act has been committed, the fact must not be concealed. Thetraining must be offered back with regret:It is said the vows can thereby arise again.If a defeating act is concealed, the vows cannot be repaired during thislifetime.In the case of remaining downfalls, downfalls that require relinquishment, andothers, they must be regrettedIn the presence of the monastic community. By energetic application to restoringthe vows, they can be purified.If a defeating act has been committed, the fact is not concealed, and thetraining is offered back with regret, the vows can arise when taken again. Ifthe defeating act has been concealed, the vows cannot be repaired during thislifetime. Remaining downfalls, downfalls that require relinquishment, and otherinfractions can be repaired by regret (that is, acknowledgment) in the presenceof the monastic community. By energetic application to the formulae forrestoring the vows, they can be purified.THE FOUNDATION, PATHS, AND RESULTS OF THE HEARERS’ WAY [III][05_toc-title.html#sec-29]This chapter has two parts: (1) the foundation and (2) the paths and results ofthe hearers’ way.The Foundation of the Hearers’ Way [A]On the basis of the vows of individual liberation, taken so that the holderreaches freedom from existence,The hearers practice the four guidelines of ennobling training.The exalted hearers take the vows of individual liberation as their basicsupport to grasp the banner that signals their freedom from the great prison pitof the three realms’ existences. They then practice the four guidelines ofennobling training: to not return anger with anger, to not return verbal abusewith verbal abuse, to not return blows with blows, and to not return criticismwith criticism.The essence of the hearers’ way is the wish to free yourself alone from theround of rebirth. This attitude is a technique to realize the nonexistence ofthe individual’s sense of self. The literal definition of hearer (Tib. nyanthos, pronounced “nyen-tö”) is that, relying on a master, one listens to (nyen)and hears (tö) the doctrine, then makes this known to others (Tib. sgrogs,pronounced “drok”). Thus, they are called either “hearer-proclaimers” (tö drok)or “listener-hearers” (nyen-tö). The purpose for this path is that through theaccomplishment of awakening in this final lifetime in existence, you can surelyexit from the round of rebirth. A classification of these individuals has twocategories: followers of the discourses—the discourse school; and followers ofThe Great Treasury of Detailed Explanations—the analytic school.The truth of suffering teaches that existence is like a sickness produced in thebody, speech, and mind by outer or inner conditions, with various effects, suchas pain, undesirable circumstances, illness, and injury. These experiencesexemplify the suffering due to the five psychophysical aggregations, and theirperpetuation, during life within the round of rebirth. To extricate yourselffrom this suffering in which you have become enmeshed, you begin byunderstanding the nature of suffering.The truth of the source of suffering teaches that formative karma resembles thecause of sickness. Formative karma is the cause (such as the three poisons,along with ignorance) which creates suffering, like the artist who draws apicture. You begin to renounce that cause.The truth of cessation resembles the comfort of a cure from sickness. You exertyourself to attain the result—the special joy of freedom, as if from an epidemicor from the chasm of the round of rebirth.The truth of the path resembles medicine. To become liberated from the sicknessof suffering, you begin to meditate.What is suffering? It is the arising psychophysical aggregations—sentientbeings’ births and their birthplaces. What is meant by “birth” is the cycle fromone rebirth to another among the six kinds of beings. What is meant by“birthplace” is the worlds of outer environments. An enumeration of sufferingsincludes heat, cold, hunger, thirst, aging, sickness, and death. The source ofsuffering refers to the aspects of its causes: karma and mental afflictions.What is meant by “mental afflictions” includes desire; what is meant by “karma”is twofold: an act that is intended and the mind, which are reflected inennobling, corrupting, and neutral acts. What is “intended” is physical andverbal karma; the “mind” is mental karma. Corrupting acts include killing andthe other nine corrupting acts; the five acts of immediate fruition (such askilling your mother or father); the five acts of proximate fruition (such askilling a bodhisattva); and such acts as forsaking Buddhist training. Ennoblingacts include the renunciation of killing. Acts of undetermined outcome includethe creative arts and construction. Cessation is the definite pacification,either with or without remainder, of suffering and of its causes. The path isthe knowledge of suffering, the renunciation of its source, the actualization ofcessation, and the five paths’ meditations while relying on those paths’courses.The Paths and Results of the Hearers’ Way [B]The view is realization of the nonexistence of a self sensed in the individual;Meditation is actualization of the thirty-seven facets of awakeningAlong the paths of cultivation, application, seeing, and meditation.The code of conduct is to keep the two hundred and fifty-three monastic vowsduring ten thousand great eons.Having thus trained, the result beyond training is the state of arhat.The view is the realization of the nonexistence of a self sensed in theindividual: you reach a conclusion concerning the basis of the self, the fivepsychophysical aggregations—the absence of an I, the absence of a self—andrealize that the sense of self is intrinsically nonexistent, empty.Meditation along the lesser path of cultivation is on the four forms ofmindfulness; along the path’s middle level, on the four forms of correctrenunciation; and at the highest level, on the four supports for miraculouspower. At the heat and peak levels of the path of application, meditation is onthe five powers; at the levels of forbearance and sublime qualities, on the fiveforces. Along the path of seeing, meditation is on the seven aspects ofawakening; at the path of meditation, on the branches of the eightfold exaltedpath. Thus, these thirty-seven facets of awakening are actualized by thesestages of meditation.The Path of Cultivation according to the Hearers’ WayFirst, all paths begin with the lesser path of cultivation. Beginners who enterit have attachment to their own and to others’ bodies; to remedy this, theymeditate on mindfulness of the body. The general remedy for desire is tomeditate on your own and others’ bodies, and on all appearances, as skeletons:this counteracts attachment. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:Meditate on skeletons as a remedy for all that involves attachment.Specific remedies are provided by meditations on eight perceptions: the image ofa corpse, its decomposition, its destruction by insects, and so on. Once freefrom attachment, you can sometimes regard the body with the mindfulness of thesubsequent observation of the body, such as meditating on it as a hollow reed.This is followed by the mindfulness of sensation: perception of threesensations—pleasure, pain, or neutral—as a descent into suffering, andmeditation on the perception of sensation as without a core, like a hollow reed.A discourse states:Know that any sensation whatsoever is entirely suffering.This is followed by meditation on the mindfulness of mind. This takes the formof mental tranquility and insight. Once you hold your attention on the outwardand inward movement of the breath, you experience the stilling of discursivethoughts and the mind’s relative truth. Upon examining this, you experience itsultimate truth—the mind’s indivisible moments. Within this insight, you meditateon the meaning of the nonexistence of the sense of self.This is followed by meditation on the mindfulness of phenomena. You meditatethat, within the phenomena included within the aggregations of formative factorsand consciousness, your external and internal senses of an existent autonomousidentity lack an intrinsic nature, are impermanent, or like an illusion, and soon.In the course of these four forms of mindfulness, you use mindfulness of body,sensation, and mind to meditate on the aggregations of form, sensation, andperception as not having an essential core, and so on. Then you use themindfulness of phenomena to meditate upon the aggregations of formative factorsand consciousness. Thus, these meditations counteract in various ways the mentalafflictions induced by manifest attachment to phenomena, subsumed as the fivepsychophysical aggregations. The coarse objects to be renounced are therebysuppressed and you enter the higher paths. The Treasury of Observed Phenomenastates:By thorough examination of the two characteristicsOf the body, sensation, mind, and phenomena . . .Thus, “the two characteristics” are general characteristics and thecharacteristics unique to each. Meditate on the body as unclean, sensation assuffering, the mind as impermanent, and phenomena as intrinsically lacking anautonomous identity.Then, once the middle path of cultivation has arisen, you undertake diligentendeavor and meditate to prevent the development of corrupting acts not yetarisen, to restrain those that have, to develop ennobling acts not yet arisen,and to increase those that have. Since these stages cause whatever is corruptingto be entirely relinquished, they are called the forms of correct renunciation.Then, when the higher path of cultivation has arisen, you meditate on themeditative states of intent, diligence, mind, and examination. In sequence,these are meditation having developed single-focused intent on the framework ofrelative or ultimate ennobling acts; full effort within this ongoing state, toprolong it; single-focused concentration; and meditation based on examinationthat completely discerns the meaning. Because these meditations produce anynumber of states of meditative stability, which in turn produce the skillfulmeans (or aspects) of miraculous powers, they are called “the supports formiraculous powers.”The Path of Application according to the Hearers’ WayThe path of application then arises in your stream of being. At the heat andpeak levels of this path, meditation is on the five powers: faith, diligence,mindfulness, meditative states, and sublime insight. With confidence based onfaith in the sixteen aspects of the four noble truths, you meditate; diligencefosters interest; mindfulness ensures that your understanding of the subjects isnot forgotten; meditative states allow your mind to grasp subjectsone-pointedly; and sublime insight discerns the nature of those subjects. TheTreasury of Observed Phenomena states:Heat’s domain is the four noble truths.Meditation has sixteen aspects, after which heatLeads to the peak, which is similar.What are these sixteen aspects? The four aspects of the truth of suffering are(1) impermanence, (2) suffering, (3) emptiness, and (4) absence of an autonomousidentity. The four aspects of the truth of the source of suffering are (5)cause, (6) source, (7) production, and (8) the very essence of conditions. Thefour aspects of the truth of cessation are (9) nonself, (10) peace, (11)abundant happiness, and (12) isolation. The four aspects of the truth of thepath are (13) the path, (14) reasoning, (15) achievement, and (16) certainrelease.At the levels of forbearance and sublime qualities on the path of application,meditation is on the five forces. They are called forces due to the aspect oftheir special capacity to overcome the mental afflictions. Their style ofmeditation is similar to that of the five powers.Concerning this style of meditation on the aspects of the four noble truths, thesame text states:Forbearance arises from that;Its two stages are similar.In this context, the four aspects of the truth of suffering in the desire realmare joined with the four aspects of suffering in the higher two realms (countedas one), eight in all. In a similar fashion, each of the aspects of the truthsof the source, cessation, and path has eight, a total of thirty-two. Further,these thirty-two aspects can be multiplied by seven—the levels of heat and peak(that is, three each for the desire realm and the higher two realms) and thelesser level of forbearance—to give a total of two hundred and twenty-fouraspects to meditate upon.At the middle level of forbearance, among the thirty-two aspects, you relinquishthe four of the truth of the path of the higher realms; thus you meditate ontwenty-eight aspects. Further, once you relinquish the four aspects of the truthof the path related to the body in the desire realm, you meditate on twenty-fouraspects. After relinquishing the four aspects of the truth of cessation in thehigher realms, you meditate on twenty. After you relinquish the four aspects ofthe truth of cessation in the desire realm, sixteen. After you relinquish thefour aspects of the truth of the source of suffering of the higher realms,twelve. After you relinquish the four aspects of the truth of the source ofsuffering of the desire realm, eight. After you relinquish the four aspects ofthe truth of suffering of the higher realms, four.Thus, as described, in the meditation on the four aspects of the truth ofsuffering in the desire realm, there are two kinds of individual, those who arecharacterized principally by craving and those characterized by views.The first (that is, individuals characterized by craving) meditate on threeaspects of the desire realm’s four truths, having relinquished either the truthof cessation or that of the path. Then they relinquish the other: they meditateon the truths of suffering and its source. At that point, there are two kinds offaults: one from pride at the thought, “I exist”; the other from complacency dueto apathy. Those who have the first fault meditate twice on the aspect ofimpermanence to complete the middle level of forbearance. Thus, on the middlelevel of forbearance, apart from the aspects discarded, a total of one hundredand nineteen aspects remain to be meditated upon. The Designation states:One hundred and nineteen instants . . .Then, by meditating once upon the aspect of impermanence, they complete thehighest level of forbearance. They complete the level of supreme qualities byanother repetition of this meditation. Then, when they see impermanence,forbearance of the knowledge of the reality of suffering arises. In relation tothe second fault, that of complacency due to apathy, individuals meditate twiceon the aspect of the truth of suffering to complete the middle level offorbearance, and so on, as before in the case of individuals with pride.Second, those characterized by views relinquish either of the first two aspectsof the four truths, then meditate upon the three remaining aspects. They thenrelinquish the other and meditate on the final two. Here as well there are thetwo kinds of individuals: Those characterized by the view of what pertains to asense of self meditate twice on the aspect of emptiness and thus complete themiddle level of forbearance. Those characterized by the view of the sense ofself meditate twice on the aspect of lack of an intrinsic self, and thuscomplete the middle level of forbearance. Attainment of the highest level offorbearance and supreme qualities follows similar patterns as before.The Path of Seeing according to the Hearers’ WayAfter the path of application is thus completed, the stages of the sixteeninstants of the path of seeing arise sequentially. The first fifteen belong tothe path of seeing. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:Concerning that, there are the fifteen moments:What was not seen is seen; thus, “the path of seeing.”The sixteenth instant belongs to the path of meditation; it is also the antidotethat prolongs the process of renunciation on the path of seeing.Concerning the process of renunciation on the path of seeing, what is to beabandoned on that path is pervasive labeling. If this is classified from theperspective of its essence, there are six categories; The Treasury of ObservedPhenomena states:The root of existence expands from six subtle parts:Desire, and likewise, anger,Pride, ignorance, views,And doubt. Moreover, these six . . .The Path of Seeing according to the Hearers’ Analytic SchoolIf these six things to be abandoned are categorized by focus, realm, andmistaken engagement, the hearer analytic school focuses on the four truths todescribe ten stages of mistaken engagement within the three realms—five viewsand five nonviews. The five views are to consider “an accumulation of perishablethings” as a self, to cling to extremes, wrong views, to esteem philosophicalviews as sublime, and to esteem ethical conduct and ascetic practice. The fivenonviews are desire, anger, pride, ignorance, and doubt.How does one engage in these? The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:With the exception of three or two views,There are ten, seven, seven, and eight subtle roots of existence that areabandoned.“The three views” mentioned here refer to the first two and the last among thefive listed above; “the two views” refer to the first two. While one does notengage in these, one does with the rest; thus there are thirty-two thingsrenounced on the path of seeing in the desire realm. In the upper two realms,since anger is subtracted from each of the four, there are twenty-eight viewsand nonviews renounced in each realm through focus upon the four truths. Thus,in all, eighty-eight things are renounced on the path of seeing.To explain, in relation to the appearance of the truth of suffering in thedesire realm, there are five manners of direct engagement and five manners ofengagement based on that mistaken connection having begun. The first five arethe following: the view of “an accumulation of perishable things” as a selfperceives a self and that which pertains to a self within the domain of thetruth of suffering; the view that clings to extremes adheres to existence ornonexistence, eternalism or nihilism; wrong views adhere to nothingness;ignorance engages in things without comprehension of their characteristics; anddoubt is engagement while uncertain whether or not the five psychophysicalaggregations constitute the truth of suffering.The second five (the five manners of engagement based on that mistakenconnection having begun) are based on the five views: desire is to be attachedand fixated on the five views; pride is to be prideful and arrogant in relationto them; the view that esteems philosophical views considers such views to besublime; the view that esteems ethical conduct and ascetic practice considersthem to be purity and liberation; and anger is to be irritated when hearing theview of the absence of autonomous identity, which contradicts the above fiveviews.Further, to explain the “seven, seven” in the quote above, in a manner similarto that of the truth of suffering, the truth of the source of suffering and thetruth of cessation in the desire realm effect the relinquishment of sevenmistaken manners of engagement. These are the above ten, minus three views—theview of “an accumulation of perishable things” as a self, clinging to extremes,and esteem of ethical conduct and ascetic practice.Further, to explain the “eight” in the quote above, the truth of the path in thedesire realm effects the relinquishment of eight mistaken manners of engagement.These are the above ten, minus two views—the view of “an accumulation ofperishable things” as a self and clinging to extremes.Thus, in the desire realm, the four truths counteract a total of thirty-twothings renounced on the path of seeing. In the higher two realms, anger issubtracted, but the others are counted as before. Thus it is stated,They are nine, six, six, and seven.Thus, each of the two higher realms has twenty-eight things to be abandoned onthe path of seeing, a total of fifty-six, to which are added the previousthirty-two of the desire realm, a total of eighty-eight.The Path of Seeing according to the Hearers’ Discourse SchoolAccording to the discourse school, the truth of suffering counteracts the desirerealm’s ten aspects of mistaken engagement; the other three truths, eight each(the view of “an accumulation of perishable things” as a self and clinging toextremes are subtracted), a total of thirty-four. For the upper two realms,because anger focused on the four truths is subtracted, there are thirty foreach realm. Thus the discourse school believes that a total of ninety-fourthings are abandoned on the path of seeing. The Compendium of Definitionsstates:The truth of the source of suffering has—except for the two views of clinging toimpermanent phenomena as a self and clinging to extremes—eight manners ofmistaken engagement with the mental afflictions. The truths of cessation and ofthe path are similar.Renunciation of these things on the path of seeing can be either gradual orsudden. First, in the course of the path of seeing’s fifteen instants, those ofgradual progress relinquish eight times what must be abandoned on that path. Toexplain, patience that has the knowledge of suffering’s reality as its objecteffects the direct abandonment of the desire realm’s ten manners of mistakenengagement in the truth of suffering. This is effected by the arising pathwithout obstacles. Knowledge of suffering’s reality is the indirect antidote’smanner to abandon the ten. Forbearance of the subsequent knowledge of sufferingeffects the direct abandonment of the eighteen mistaken manners of engagement inthe truth of suffering in the higher two realms; subsequent knowledge is theindirect antidote’s manner of abandoning them. Abandonment in relation to theremaining three truths follows the same pattern.Second, in the course of the path of seeing’s fifteen instants, those of suddenprogress renounce four times what must be abandoned on the path of seeing, aprocess similar to the bodhisattvas’ manner of renunciation.Along the path of seeing, meditation is on the seven aspects of awakening:correct mindfulness, correct analysis of phenomena, correct diligence, correctjoy, correct extreme refinement, correct meditative states, and correctequanimity.The Path of Meditation according to the Hearers’ WayFollowing the path of seeing, the path of meditation arises. Along its threestages—lesser, middle, and higher—there are nine levels: lesser lesser, middlelesser, and higher lesser; lesser middle, middle middle, and higher middle;lesser higher, middle higher, and higher higher.The nine antidotes on the path of meditation, which counteract what must beabandoned, are divided into three degrees—greater, middle, and lesser—but arepresented in reverse order from the levels of the path where they arerelinquished, from greater greater, and so on. The Treasury of ObservedPhenomena states:The path of meditation has nine stages and proximate stages,And, similarly, qualities,Divided into lesser, middle, and higher.Therefore, the lesser and the others are distinct.Moreover, the essence of the nine levels, the ninefold path of meditation’sfunctional antidote, is meditation on the eightfold exalted path: correct view,correct thought, correct speech, correct limits to actions, correct livelihood,correct effort, correct mindfulness, and correct meditative states.Likewise, meditation includes the nine final states of composure: (1–4) thefirst, second, third, and fourth levels of meditative stability, (5–8) the fourlevels of formlessness—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingwhatsoever, neither existence nor nonexistence; and (9) cessation. Moreover,meditation is sometimes done with a general focus, to gain what is not yetattained, and sometimes to complete what is already gained.The impurities to be abandoned on these stages are of a coemergent nature. TheCompendium of Definitions states:“Coemergent” refers to those impurities of immature ordinary individuals, eventhose of birds or animals.Classified by essence, there are four impurities: desire, anger, pride, andignorance. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:Four are relinquished on the path of meditation.Classified by realms, there are four impurities to be relinquished in the desirerealm; and in the two higher realms, three each, a total of ten.Classified by the levels of beings’ existences, in the desire realm’s stages,there are four impurities to be relinquished, and three on each of the eightstages of the two higher realms—four on the level of the form realm’s meditativestability and four on the levels of formlessness: a total of twenty-eight.Classified according to the stages, and their great and middle levels, there arenine stages: the desire realm, the four levels of meditative stability in theform realm, and four levels of formlessness. Each stage has three degrees ofdesire (lesser, middle, and greater), each of which in turn is subdivided intothree levels, to give nine sets of nine. Similarly, there are nine sets of ninefor pride, nine sets of nine for ignorance, and one set of nine for anger in thedesire realm, a total of two hundred and fifty-two. The Treasury of ObservedPhenomena states:Four things are what is abandoned on the path of meditation.Except for anger, these sameAre also present in the form and formless realms.How are these things abandoned on the path of meditation? They are relinquishedthrough cessation, as they are relinquished at the same time the previous stageceases. The same text states:When the mind of no further training arises,You are freed from obscurations.The path of cessationCompletely abandons those obscurations.Those of sudden progress on the path renounce together the things abandoned onthe path of meditation in the three realms. For them, cessation of the lesserlesser path of meditation and the noncausal cessation of the highest highestpath of meditation happen simultaneously. Those of gradual progress renouncesequentially the nine degrees of things to be abandoned on the path’s ninestages. By following this path, the actualization of the thirty-seven facets ofawakening takes eleven great eons.The code of conduct of the hearers is the traversing of the path while guardingthe supreme ethical conduct of the two hundred and fifty-three vows of a fullyordained monk.The Result of the Spiritual Path according to the Hearers’ WayAfter having trained in these paths as described, the result, the path of nofurther training, is the state of arhat of the hearers’ way—lesser manifestawakening. In this, two wisdoms are actualized: knowledge of exhaustion andknowledge of no coming-into-being. The same text states:Knowledge of exhaustion and of no coming-into-beingIs awakening.“Knowledge of exhaustion” refers to the perception of these aspects: “I willknow suffering; I will relinquish the source of suffering; I will actualizecessation; and I will rely on the path’s course.” The same text states:Knowledge of exhaustion is to have certain renunciation and knowledgeIn relation to the truths.“Knowledge of no coming-into-being” refers to there being no further object ofknowledge, once suffering, and so on, is known. The same text states:“No further object of knowledge,” and so on,Is what is believed to be no coming-into-being.Those endowed with these two aspects of wisdom are arhats, either with remainderor without remainder. Arhats with remainder have not rejected the assumedpsychophysical aggregations and thus have a slight remainder of the truth ofsuffering; thus they protect the senses carefully from the senses’ objectivedomains. Arhats with remainder’s sublime insight realize that the remainder’ssupport has no autonomous identity. Thus, they have renounced what is to beabandoned in the three realms; yet such arhats can be two kinds: “withoutornaments” if their meditative stability has not led to the attainment ofmiraculous powers, and so forth; or “adorned,” if they have attained suchpowers.Another distinction in the classification of arhat can be made, based onrenunciation and capability. First, in a classification based on renunciation,arhats can reach liberation through both meditative states and sublime insightor through sublime insight alone. Accordingly, the force of sublime insight andmeditative states produces liberation from both the obscurations of the threerealms’ mental afflictions and obscurations to composure; the second, sublimeinsight alone, produces liberation from the obscurations of mental afflictionsbut not from obscurations to composure.Obscurations of mental afflictions are what produce an afflicted state, such asthe three poisons. Obscurations to composure, such as depression and elation,impede meditative states. Further, obscurations to composure that prevent thearising of its causes precede meditative states, whereas obscurations thatimpede resting in the result do not permit abiding in the mind of the present.Although these terms are identical to terminology used in the great way, theirmeanings in this context are different.Second, when classified according to capability, there are six kinds of arhat:those who can deteriorate, those who kill themselves, those who can preservetheir state, those who cannot progress, those who have the fortune ofrealization, and those who are immovable.First, those who can deteriorate: for these arhats of inferior acumen,comfortable abiding deteriorates due to phenomena they perceive. Moreover, theirbliss of meditative stability deteriorates. Second, those who kill themselves:these arhats of inferior acumen think that they will not deteriorate if theirself is killed but they will deteriorate if it is not. Not wanting longevity orpossessions, they are called “those who consider dying.” Third, those who canpreserve their state: for these arhats of inferior acumen, blissful stillnessdeteriorates if they are inebriated; it does not deteriorate if they are not.“Inebriation” or its lack refers to mental distraction due to sensual pleasuresor the lack of such distraction. Fourth, those who cannot progress: for thesearhats of inferior acumen, blissful stillness does not deteriorate, but they donot have the fortune to progress. Fifth, those who have the fortune ofrealization: for these arhats of inferior acumen, blissful stillness does notdeteriorate, and they have the fortune to progress. Their fortune in realizationcomes from hearing instruction from more advanced teachers. Sixth, those who areimmovable: for these arhats of acute acumen, blissful stillness in phenomenathey perceive will not deteriorate.All six of these arhats live within the desire realm. Two kinds of arhats livein the upper two realms: those who do not move and those who cannot be moved.These are the arhats characterized by a support with remainder.Those without remainder, like a fire that has consumed its fuel, leave nothingbehind when they transcend sorrow. It is believed that their wisdom of theceasing of mind has entered the basic space of cessation. The Collection ofSayings states:When there is no body, perception ceases,You are free from all sensation,Formative factors are entirely still,And consciousness has vanished.The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse states:Arhats who completely transcend suffering have entered cessation. After tenthousand eons, they uplift their minds to unsurpassable, authentic, perfectawakening.THE FOUNDATION, PATHS, AND RESULTS OF THE SOLITARY SAGES’ WAY [IV][05_toc-title.html#sec-30]The foundation of the way of solitary sages is to correctly restrain yourself,motivated by disengagement.The view is the nonexistence of the individual sense of self, but withoutrenunciationOf the clinging consciousness that grasps objective phenomena.The rhinoceros-like sage traverses the path during the course of one hundredgreat eons;The solitary sage of a large community, during one hundred lifetimes;And the solitary sage of a small community, in just thirteen human lifetimes.On the four paths—cultivation, application, seeing, and meditation—Meditation is done on the thirty-seven facets of awakening, the three gatewaysto liberation,And the unfolding and reversal of the twelve links of causation—Ignorance, formations, consciousness, name and form aggregations,Senses, contact, sensation, craving,Grasping, existence, birth, and aging and death.The code of conduct is to sustain the sublime ethical conduct of serenity andself-control.The result of no further training is the state of a solitary sage arhat, amiddle state of awakening.Solitary sages rest in the sphere of static peace for as long a period as theyspent cultivating goodness and wisdom.Then they are born in a lotus in a pure land of the manifest body ofenlightenment;After seven years, the lotus opens,The sages see the Buddha’s face, and they learn the great way.The essence of the way of solitary sages is initial erudition in hearing thecollection of hearer teachings and reflection upon it, followed by theaspiration to be reborn in a world without buddhas or hearers, and to therepresent the teachings through symbols. Solitary sages do not rely on a teacher;they realize one and a half of the two aspects of the nonexistence of anautonomous identity, a self.The literal definition of “solitary sage” is a person who does not intend toserve many beings but wishes for enlightenment for his or her own sake. Thepurpose of this path is to attain a middle stage of awakening, free from theround of rebirth. The classification of such sages is as community-dwellers,like parrots; or as those who live alone, like a rhinoceros.The foundation of this way is acceptance of the vows of individual liberation,motivated by authentic disengagement from the round of rebirth. This way’s viewis the absence of self in the individual and half of the lack of autonomousidentity in phenomena—that outer particles have neither parts nor no parts; theyrealize that, like reflections, phenomena by their nature have no essence and donot come into being.They realize the nature of half of phenomena—the absence of autonomous identityin outer grasping, but they do not realize the absence of an autonomous identityin the inner clinging to objective appearances. They mistakenly give the name“truth” to the absence of autonomous identity in phenomena, both the outergrasping and the inner antidote, the clinging consciousness. The individualsense of self is the consciousness to be relinquished, the grasping as “I” or“mine” in relation to phenomena, gathered into the five psychophysicalaggregations. These are called “the autonomous identity of phenomena and of theindividual.”Hearers realize the nonexistence of the individual sense of self but not theabsence of an autonomous identity in phenomena. Solitary sages meditate on theobjective absence of an autonomous identity in phenomena, the lack of anintrinsic nature within all outer objects. On the other hand, the subjectiveabsence of an autonomous identity in phenomena can be defined as the realizationthat the grasping consciousness, free from coming-into-being, cessation, orabiding, is emptiness that does not come into being. This latter (absence ofautonomous identity in phenomena) is realized by the great way and not by thehearers or solitary sages; thus, the term “half the absence of autonomousidentity in phenomena” is used to describe the realization of the solitarysages.The special cultivation of the solitary sages is cultivation of the stores ofgoodness and wisdom gathered on the path of cultivation during a period of onehundred eons. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:The rhinoceros gains awakening in a process that involves one hundred eons ofcultivation.The special path accomplished is described as follows. The Fundamental Verses onSublime Insight states:When perfect buddhas have not appearedAnd the hearers have disappeared,The wisdom of the solitary sage flourishesWithout reliance on a teacher.Therefore, after a previous life as a hearer, when solitary sages are reborn ina world without buddhas or hearers, they go to a cemetery, see bones, andimmediately become disillusioned with the round of rebirth: “Alas! Where havethese bones come from? They have come from aging and death. Where have aging anddeath come from? They have come from birth,” and so on. In this way, theyexamine the unfolding of the twelve links of causation and consider how tobecome free from this world. In the course of such reflection, they discover thetwelve links of the reversal of causation: if ignorance ceases, formationscease, and so on, until aging and death cease. With the knowledge that allphenomena only reflect the arising of interdependent causation, the solitarysage meditates on the twelve links of causation and on the sixteen aspects (suchas impermanence) of the four truths. Thus the path of application arises.Through meditation, like that of the hearers, the four levels of the path ofapplication, the sixteen moments of the path of seeing (direct realization ofthe four truths), and the path of meditation arise in turn, as they do forbodhisattvas. Following this, they actualize two aspects of wisdom—knowledge ofexhaustion and knowledge of no further coming-into-being. Thus the manner inwhich they actualize the five paths in a single session concurs with that ofbodhisattvas. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:The awakenings of the Teacher and of rhinoceros solitary sagesRely on the same culminant meditative stability.The special place has two aspects: First, the special place of their wisdom bodyis alone, like a rhinoceros. Second, the special place of their wisdom mind isreflection upon and abiding within the twelve links of causation, thethirty-seven facets of awakening, and the three gateways to liberation. Thetwelve links of causation are as follows:Ignorance, formations, consciousness, name and form aggregations,The six senses, contact, sensation,Craving, grasping, existence, birth,And aging and death.(1) Ignorance is lack of knowledge. (2) Due to ignorance, to fall into the roundof rebirth is formations. (3) From formations, the consciousness that developsfrom beings’ storehouse of dualistic experience is consciousness. (4) Fromconsciousness, individual sensation, perception, and formative factors (the fourpsychophysical aggregations that exist in name alone) develop, and based onthem, form (the fifth aggregation), are the name and form aggregation. (5) Basedon these, six senses arise—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mental faculty.(6) The gathering of the sense domains, the sense organs, and the mental facultyproduce contact. (7) This produces sensation—pleasurable, painful, or neutral.(8) Sensation leads to craving—the centering around a sense of self that rejectsunwished-for sensations or accepts what is wished for. (9) From craving, focusedintent toward your own desires arises, leading to grasping of theresult—grasping. (10) Due to grasping, you enter the womb of your nextbirth—existence. (11) Exit from the womb is birth. (12) Once youth fades, agingarrives, which leads to the cessation of life, death.Beings take existence due to their continual karma, and they circle in thismanner. For more details, consult The Great Chariot [that is, Longchenpa’sTrilogy of Rest].The thirty-seven facets of awakening are as follows:Four forms of mindfulness, four forms of correct renunciation,Four supports for miraculous powers, five powers,Five forces, seven aspects of awakening, and the eightfold exalted path:These are the thirty-seven facets of awakening.The three gateways to liberation are as follows:There are three gateways to liberation from all obscurations:Emptiness, absence of characteristics, and aspirationlessness.Of the three gateways to liberation of knowledge, absence of autonomous identityis emptiness; not perceiving things as related to such an identity is absence ofcharacteristics; and the lack of an orienting axis is aspirationlessness. Of thepath’s three gateways to liberation, the truth of cessation is emptiness; thetruth of the path is absence of characteristics; and the truths of suffering andthe source of suffering are aspirationlessness. Of the result’s three gatewaysto liberation, the result without remainder is emptiness and absence ofcharacteristics; and the result with remainder is aspirationlessness.The special instructions taught are as follows: Solitary sages are beings of thedesire realm; to nourish themselves with this realm’s food, they go tosettlements to beg and to teach their spiritual instructions by physicalgestures. To their disciples, who apply themselves to the ten ennobling acts,the four truths, and the twelve links of causation, they present a singlegesture that is understood by each disciple in a different way. The chapter onsolitary sages in The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:Any meaning is presented to anyoneIn whatever way the person wishes to hear—That specific meaning to that specific personAppears, but without words.Second,20 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st20] the description of the solitary sagewho lives in a large community also has five parts:The special group is characterized by a middle degree of acumen, strong prideand disillusionment, faint compassion, and pleasure in large communities. It issaid that these solitary sages live in groups of five hundred. Their specialcultivation is cultivation of stores of goodness and wisdom gathered before themiddle level of the path of application, during a period of one hundredlifetimes. The aspiration they formulate is similar to the one mentioned above.The way they accomplish the path is as above. The special place has two parts:The special place of their wisdom bodies is together with many solitary sages,circling together like parrots. The place of their wisdom mind is as above. Theteaching of their instructions is also as above.Third, the description of the solitary sage who lives in a small community alsohas five parts. Their special group is characterized by the lowest degree ofacumen, strong pride and disillusionment, and faint compassion. Their specialcultivation is cultivation of stores of goodness and wisdom subsumed as thefifteen instants of the path of seeing during a period of thirteen lifetimes.The remaining features are as solitary sages who dwell in large communities.The designation of solitary sages into acute or lesser degrees of acumen isrelated to whether five, four, or three paths are actualized in a singlesession. This depends upon the duration—long, medium, or short—of theirpreceding cultivation of the stores of goodness and wisdom.The conduct of solitary sages is to sustain the sublime ethical conduct oftranquility and self-control—the two hundred and fifty-three monastic vows.The Results of the Spiritual Path according to Solitary SagesThe result of the spiritual path is the path of no further training, the exaltedstate of a solitary sage arhat, which constitutes actualization of a middlestate of awakening. Hearer and solitary sage arhats depart without remainder andabide in the sphere of cessation. Although hearer and solitary sage traditionsbelieve that such arhats never move from the sphere of static peace, the greatway has a superior perspective. According to that tradition, the arhats’ mindsenter and dissolve in the sphere of static peace for the period they previouslyspent cultivating goodness and wisdom. Then they are reborn in the enclosure ofa lotus in a pure land, such as Blissful, Joyous, or Lotus-Filled, and remainfor seven years within that closed lotus due to subtle obscurations of habitualignorance and cognitive obscurations. At the moment of their birth, the sun ofcompassion of the pure land’s Buddha sends light of the Buddha’s speech to openthe lotus. The verses that cause them to arise from the unconsciousness ofinebriation within meditative states are recorded in The White Lotus of theSacred Doctrine Discourse:How can you call your state the transcendence of sorrow?You are free from every suffering of the round of rebirth,Yet you have not entirely transcended sorrow:Search for the way of enlightenment!As soon as arhats hear this, enthusiasm for the path of the great way arises,and the lotus opens. Arhats go before the Transcendent Buddha, uplift theirminds to the aspiration to awaken, and through meditation on the path, attainenlightenment during that very lifetime. The Journey to Langka Discourse states:By the blessing of the Transcendent Buddha, they gain mastery over rebirth,entirely complete the twofold cultivation, and attain enlightenment itself.The first path they enter can only be the lesser level of the path ofcultivation, after which they complete the great way’s five paths. This has ledsome to contend that such exalted persons fall to the level of ordinary beings,since they enter the path of cultivation. Such a view has arisen from a lack ofunderstanding. If ordinary individuals enter the path of cultivation asbeginners, the state of an exalted one has not yet been attained in theirexperience, thus they are called ordinary persons. When hearers or solitarysages enter that path, they are exalted beings who enter the path by meditationon the qualities of mindfulness. If performing such meditations on mindfulnesstransforms exalted beings to ordinary individuals, they could change intoordinary individuals even at the tenth stage of awakening! The stages of thesolitary sages’ path include the forms of mindfulness; thus the view that theychange to ordinary individuals is mistaken.Further, some believe that when exalted hearers or solitary sages meditate onthe forms of mindfulness, they can be considered exalted beings of the greatway. They contend this because such individuals are exalted beings who meditateon the forms of mindfulness of the great way. Is this correct? From theperspective of the great way, they do not have the characteristics of an exaltedbeing, since their state is not equal to the renunciation and realization of thegreat way’s exalted beings. Without such initial qualifications, they cannot beconsidered exalted beings of the great way: they are exalted beings of thelesser way. Further, the fact that they meditate on the forms of mindfulness ofthe great way does not prove that they are exalted beings of the great way. Thisis similar to the mistaken attitude of considering bodhisattvas who are said torefine the pure lands of the buddhas as perfect buddhas themselves.Therefore, arhats of the hearer and solitary sage ways who enter the path of thegreat way must do so from the level of the lesser path of cultivation, sinceenlightenment in the great way must be accomplished through the great way’s fivepaths and their content.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSThe fearless three jewels, a lasting refuge,Provide supreme secure sanctuaryFrom the eight great dangers, the sixteen minor ones,And every other source of fear and loss.Reliance on refuge brings lasting supreme joy and happiness.The supreme bestower of refuge is the outstanding epitome of compassion:I wholeheartedly take refuge in this supreme individual.May you compassionately watch over my parents, beings of the six kinds!May your watchfulness not fade with time.May all beings and myself now be fully placed in the incomparable good fortuneOf being manifestly like you—a sublime great treasure—Faultless, an endlessly bountiful mine of qualities.This concludes a commentary to “Taking Refuge and the Lesser Way,” Book 7 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall ways of spiritual development.

Great Auspiciousness [no. 60: 5 pages]The total of the collection of discourses gathered from all sources numbersthree hundred and five texts.There are forty treatises of commentary to the intention of the final doctrinalcycle and sixty-six treatises that principally teach the meaning of the finalcycle according to the mind only school.An Explanation of Ultimate Truth [B]This section has four parts: (1) the nature of the enlightened heritage; (2) howthe enlightened heritage is all-pervasive; (3) a complete classification of theenlightened heritage; and (4) proofs based on instruction in the enlightenedheritage.The Nature of the Enlightened Heritage [1]From the perspective of ultimate truth, the qualities of buddha nature’sappearance aspectManifest as enlightenment’s bodies and pure lands;Its emptiness aspect’s qualities include the ten forces and four forms offearlessness.The primordial, ever-present, unchanging constituent of innate awarenessIs veiled by incidental stains—the delusion of dualistic clinging, karma, andmental afflictions.When these veils are purified, stainless qualities unfold.The positive qualities of the appearance aspect of beings’ innate constituentenlightenment, buddha nature, manifest as wisdom bodies and as pure lands. Thepositive qualities of its emptiness aspect include the ten forces and four formsof fearlessness. This innate constituent enlightenment—primordial, ever present,eternally unchanging—dwells in all sentient beings, but is veiled by incidentalstains—the delusions of dualistic clinging, karma, and mental afflictions. Theway to dispel those veils—experiential cultivation along the stages of thespiritual path—purifies the two obscurations, along with their habitualpatterns. When these are purified and positive qualities and wisdom blossom,enlightenment clearly manifests.Mind’s nature—the basic space of phenomena, innate constituent enlightenment,buddha nature—is primordial, unchanging, and ever present. The HighestContinuity states:In this, nothing needs to be removed;Nothing in the least needs to be added.Regard truly the truth itself—When it is truly seen, liberation is reached.In the essence of this basic space of buddha nature, because it is naturallyluminous and stainless, there was never any stain to be rejected. No previouslylacking positive qualities need be newly added to it later, because its positivequalities are ever present. The same text states:Since it has karma and mental afflictions;Since it is pure, without mental afflictions;Since its positive qualities are thoroughly inseparable;Since its activity is ever present and nonconceptual . . .Concerning these lines, Asanga explains in his commentary that enlightenment’sstainless positive qualities have wisdom that is inseparable from the state ofan ordinary person who has mental afflictions. This point—that in the nature ofreality, no difference exists between the former state (that is, ordinary) andthe latter state (that is, enlightened)—is inconceivable.The essence of that meaning itself is the correct view. When it is seen,liberation from the incidental stains of mental afflictions is gained, like fromthe womb at birth. At that moment, previously existent positive qualitiesmanifest. Although this is termed “enlightenment,” these positive qualities havenot been newly created. Therefore, from the perspective of the essence of basicspace or buddha nature, separable material stains or faults, along with theirdefining characteristics, are empty; whereas its primordial, inherent positivequalities are not. The same text states:From the perspective of incidental phenomena that have separable traits,Beings’ innate constituent enlightenment is empty.From the perspective of unsurpassable phenomena that have no separable traits,It is not empty.A Commentary to “The Highest Continuity” states:What does this passage teach? It explains how it is that nothing, such as anunderlying cause for mental afflictions, needs to be removed from theintrinsically, completely pure nature of this transcendent constituentenlightenment, because its nature is freedom from incidental stains. Nothing inthe slightest needs to be added to it, such as an underlying cause ofpurification, since its nature is that of the inseparable pure phenomena of thenature of reality.Therefore, you should understand that, from the perspective of all that hasdistinct characteristics that can be separated from it—the confines of mentalafflictions—buddha nature is empty. Conversely, from the perspective ofenlightenment’s inconceivable positive qualities, which surpass the numbers ofthe Ganges River’s sands, which have no distinct characteristics that can beseparated from it, it is not empty.How does the enlightened heritage possess the phenomena of the round of rebirthand those of transcendent states? The phenomena of the round of rebirth resembleclouds over the sun—the enlightened heritage possesses them as if it is anobject covered and has that which covers it. The phenomena of transcendentstates resemble rays of light—the enlightened heritage possesses them since theyshare a single essence. In the basic space of phenomena (the support), as soonas an antidote removes the phenomena of the round of rebirth, along with theirimpurities (the contents), the phenomena of transcendent states manifest. Thephenomena of the round of rebirth are incidental; the positive qualities ofenlightenment have primordial and noncomposite existence. The Highest Continuitystates:It has faults that are incidentalAnd positive qualities that are intrinsic:As it was in the past, so will it be.This is the changeless nature of reality.Within the basic space of phenomena, the deathless, changeless ongoingenlightened heritage, like space, we have coursed throughout the boundless roundof rebirth during innumerable lifetimes, assuming and abandoning psychophysicalaggregations (that is, bodies), based on karma and habitual patterns. The sametext states:Just as all worldsCome into being and disintegrate within the sphere of space,The senses come into being and disintegrateIn noncomposite basic space.Although the senses appear to come into being and to disintegrate due to karmaand conditions, the innate constituent enlightenment has neither a point oforigin nor a point of disintegration, just as the fire at the end of timeconsumes the world but does not burn space. The same text states:Just as any fire in the pastHas never burned space,This innate constituent enlightenment has never been burnt by the firesOf death, sickness, or aging.All birth and death, happiness and suffering, arise from karma and mentalafflictions; likewise, they in turn arise from faulty, conceptual ignorance.Ignorance itself is based within the mind’s luminosity, just as the world restsin space.The positive qualities of transcendent states are primordially coemergent withthe innate constituent enlightenment or the enlightened heritage, like the sunand its rays. The positive qualities of the appearance aspect of transcendentstates—wisdom bodies, radiance, pure lands, celestial palaces, and the like—andthe positive qualities of awareness (the emptiness aspect of transcendentstates)—the ten forces, four forms of fearlessness, and so on—are presented in avery extensive manner in The Flower Ornament Discourse. In brief, A Commentaryto “The Highest Continuity” states:Enlightenment’s stainless positive qualities have an identical, inseparablenature, even at the stage of an ordinary individual who has mental afflictions,with no difference before or after the attainment of enlightenment. How thesepositive qualities abide is inconceivable. How can they thus abide? Any sentientbeing not imbued with the entire wisdom of the transcendent buddhas cannot evenbe called any kind of sentient being. However, dualistic perception prevents asentient being’s wisdom of the transcendent buddhas from manifesting. Once freedfrom dualistic perception, the wisdom of omniscient nondual knowledge andself-arisen wisdom will fully and uninhibitedly arise.The Flower Ornament Discourse states:O children of the victors! It is like this: for example, imagine a large silkcloth equal in size to a great triple cosmos. On this cloth is written theinformation concerning all worlds of this great triple cosmos. It would be likethis: on a measure equal to a great horizon, a great horizon would be written;on a measure equal to the great earth, the great earth would be written; on ameasure equal to a double cosmos, the worlds of such a universe would bewritten; on a measure equal to a simple cosmos, the worlds of such a universe;on a measure equal to the worlds of a four-continent world-system, the worlds ofsuch a system; on the measure of a great ocean, the great ocean; on a measureequal to the Land of Jambu, the Land of Jambu; on a measure equal to the easterncontinent, Noble Body, the eastern continent of Noble Body; on a measure equalto the western continent, Wealth of Cattle, the western continent Wealth ofCattle; on a measure equal to the northern continent, Unpleasant Sound, thenorthern continent Unpleasant Sound; on a measure equal to Supreme Mountain,Supreme Mountain; on a measure equal to a celestial palace of the gods who liveon the ground, a celestial palace of the gods who live on the ground; on ameasure equal to a celestial palace of the gods who live in the realm of desire,a celestial palace of the gods who live in the realm of desire; on a measureequal to a celestial palace of the gods who live in the realm of form, acelestial palace of the gods who live in the realm of form would be written.That great silk cloth would have a depth equal to the measure of worlds of thegreat triple cosmos. Then further imagine that this great silk cloth iscontained within a single of the finest atoms. Just as the great silk cloth iscontained within a single fine atom, every fine atom without exception containssuch a large cloth.Imagine then that some wise and learned persons are born, endowed with clearminds and with the faculty to fully comprehend this. Their eyes become the eyesof the gods, able to see every thing in luminous purity. They gaze with sucheyes and think, “Such a great silk cloth as this rests within such a tiny, fineatom, yet this does not help any sentient being in the least.” Further, theyreflect, “Alas! Whoever through great force and energetic application breaksopen that fine atom to free this great silk cloth will provide great help forall beings.” They then develop the force of that intense energetic applicationand break open the atom with a minute vajra and, as they had planned, help everybeing with the great cloth. As in that one case, they open every atom withoutexception.O children of the victors! In the same way, the transcendent buddhas’ wisdom,unlimited wisdom, wisdom that would prove useful for all sentient beings, existscomplete in every regard within the minds of all sentient beings. Sentientbeings’ minds are, moreover, like the transcendent buddhas’ wisdom—immeasurable.From the perspective of the enlightened heritage’s own essence, its positivequalities are ever present, and faults never covered it. From the perspective ofits appearance, it had mental afflictions and was subsequently purified. Thatthe enlightened heritage is pure and that it is also impure, and that the twoare not mutually exclusive, make it an inconceivable phenomenon. The same text(Asanga’s Commentary) states:This transcendent nature, with stains, is at one and the same time, bothcompletely pure and thoroughly afflicted. Therefore its state is inconceivable.Further, in the same text,This transcendent nature, without stains, was never thoroughly afflicted bystains and did not subsequently become pure. Therefore this state isinconceivable.How the Enlightened Heritage Is All-Pervasive [2]Buddha nature pervades all sentient life.The signs of this enlightened heritage having awakened are sight of existence’sfaults and of the qualities of perfect peace.Its supreme qualities liberate us from the sea of existence.The way buddha nature pervades has three aspects: its natural way of pervading,the signs of the enlightened heritage, and its positive qualities. First, TheLion’s Roar of Shrimaladevi states:Buddha nature pervades all beings.The Highest Continuity states:All embodied beings always possess buddha natureBecause the body of perfect enlightenment is pervasive,Because the transcendent nature is inseparable,And because beings have an enlightened heritage.Second, signs of the enlightened heritage have two parts. First, indications ofits dormant presence are as the same text states:However, without enlightenment’s innate constituent,You could not become disenchanted with suffering,Nor could you desire to transcend sorrow,Nor could you aspire to strive for that goal.This describes some common persons. Second, the signs of the enlightenedheritage having woken are stated in the same text:Sight of the faults of suffering in existenceAnd the positive qualities of happiness in transcendent statesComes to those who have this enlightened heritage. Why?It does not come to those without it.Third, its positive qualities are stated in The Ornament of the Discourses:That sublime enlightened heritage is like an excellent rootBecause its extremely extensive qualities nurture the tree of awakening,Because it produces happiness and the end of severe suffering,And because its fruit brings welfare and happiness to yourself and others.A Complete Classification of the Enlightened Heritage [3]This section has three parts: classification of the enlightened heritage basedon its (1) support and content, (2) circumstances, and (3) metaphors andmeaning.Classification of the Enlightened Heritage Based on Its Support and Content [a]The basic space of phenomena is the support; appearances, the content.If the previously mentioned pervasive luminosity is classified according toappearance and emptiness, it can be said to be twofold. The empty basic space ofphenomena constitutes “what must be separated from delusion” to produce the bodyof ultimate enlightenment, the essence wisdom body (referred to as the“support”). Wisdom’s appearances—natural luminosity adorned with the marks andsigns of enlightenment’s physical perfection—constitute “what must be separatedfrom delusion” to produce enlightenment’s two bodies that have form (referred toas the “content”). The Highest Continuity states:Like a treasure and a fruit tree,The enlightened heritage is known as twofold.The first is naturally present since time immemorial;The other is the sublime, fully cultivated enlightened heritage.It is believed that these two aspects of the enlightened heritageProduce the attainment of the three wisdom bodies.The first produces the first body;The second, the latter two.The exquisite essence wisdom bodyCan be understood to be like a statue of jewels,Because its precious stones are natural, not manufactured,And because its precious qualities constitute a treasure.The wisdom body of perfect rapture resembles a universal monarch,Because it holds dominion over the kingdom of great qualities.The manifest body is like a gold statueBecause its nature is a reflected image.When the enlightened heritage is differentiated according to the contexts of theground of our being and the spiritual path, it has two aspects—the naturallypresent enlightened heritage and the enlightened heritage fully cultivated onthe spiritual path.When the basic space of phenomena’s nature dwells as the all-pervasive ground ofbeing, the ground of being as the ground for anything to arise (the part whichis the basic space of phenomena) can be likened to a treasure of preciousjewels. It dwells as a ground for whatever is wished, without becomingmaterially localized in any way whatsoever. Likewise, the body of ultimateenlightenment, the basic space of the essence wisdom body, creates space for thearising of enlightenment’s bodies and wisdom.The appearance aspects of the wisdoms that arise in that space—awareness andwisdom bodies—are your innate positive qualities that surely manifest due to theforce of your having become freed from obscurations based in passing conditions.Just this aspect is likened to a burgeoning fruit tree, a case of the cause(purity) being called by the name of the result. The Ornament of the Discoursesdescribes these with the metaphors of a gold mountain and a supreme jewel.Additionally, to explain this subject from the perspective of the period oftraining on the spiritual path, the natural, spontaneous presence of bothaspects (that is, naturally present and fully cultivated) of the basic space ofphenomena’s enlightened heritage is termed the “natural enlightened heritage.”This acts as a support upon which any cultivation of the sources of ennoblingacts, synthesized as the dual cultivation of goodness and wisdom (from theinitial uplift of the mind to awakening until culmination at awakening’s tenthstage) is termed the “fully cultivated” or “unfolding” enlightened heritage.Such ennobling acts are an antidote, newly undertaken, employed to remove stainson the natural enlightened heritage. This process makes it appear as if positivequalities you already had were newly created.These days, these two aspects of the enlightened heritage are not considered tobe part of the ground of being. Rather, the ground of being is said to be thenatural enlightened heritage; the path, the unfolding enlightened heritage. Thisconstruct seems to be due to a lack of comprehension of the basic space ofphenomena, since it does not account for the spontaneous presence of bothappearance and emptiness in the ground of being. The Ornament of the Discoursesstates:Not different before or after,Yet the transcendent nature has been purified.The Highest Continuity states:Noncomposite, ever present,Not realized through extraneous conditions,Endowed with wisdom, love, and capability:This is enlightenment that fulfills the two goals.Therefore, apart from the causes and results of freedom from extraneousobscurations, enlightenment is not accomplished in a process based on causesthat produce an intended goal. Enlightenment is primordial, ever present.Therefore, the two enlightened heritages should be understood to be aspects ofthe three wisdom bodies that exist primordially.The cultivation of goodness, such as uplift of the mind to awakening, removesstains that obscure the wisdom bodies that have form; the cultivation of wisdom,such as meditation on emptiness, removes stains that obscure the nature ofreality, the essence wisdom body. At the level of enlightenment, the unfoldingenlightened heritage is the appearance aspect, the wisdom body of rapture; thenatural enlightened heritage is its emptiness aspect, the body of ultimateenlightenment. Through the blessing of their inseparability, the manifest wisdombody appears in beings’ perception, according to the fortune of each, just asthe image of a universal monarch in the sky appears reflected on the flank of agolden mountain.Classification of the Enlightened Heritage Based on Its Circumstances [b]The enlightened heritage can exist within impurity, purity, or extreme purity.Sentient beings’ enlightened heritage exists within impurity; bodhisattvas’enlightened heritage, in the purification of impurity; and the transcendentbuddhas’ enlightened heritage or innate constituent enlightenment, in extremepurity. For example, containers made from such substances as clay, wood, orjewels each appear to have greater or lesser value, but the space they hold hasno distinguishing value. The Discourse of the Essence of Enlightenment states:Partial realization, as opposed to total realization, can be explained in thefollowing words. Ordinary beings, hearers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas donot see buddha nature exactly as it is. For example, if a person blind frombirth asks someone the color of butter, the person might reply, “It’s like thatof a pillar.” The blind man can touch the pillar and conclude butter’s color tobe cool. If the reply was “Like a swan’s wings,” the blind man can hear a wing’ssound and think that the color makes a whooshing sound. If he asks, “What is thecolor of a swan’s wings like?” and the reply is, “Like a conch shell,” he cantouch a shell and imagine the color to be smooth. Regardless of the reply, aperson blind from birth cannot know colors exactly as they are. Likewise, to seeenlightenment’s nature is extremely difficult.This buddha nature is difficult for an ordinary person to understand, as statedin the same text:A king assembled a group of blind men, showed them an elephant, and ordered themto tell him the elephant’s features. Those who touched the elephant’s trunksaid, “It’s like a hook.” Those who touched the eyes said, “It’s like a cup.”Those who touched the ears said, “It’s like a basket.” Those who touched theback said, “It’s like a chair.” Those who touched the tail said, “It’s like arope.” Each blind man did not relate anything besides his own impression of theelephant, yet none had any realization of its totality. Likewise, the nature ofenlightenment can be described in its separate features, such as emptiness,illusion-like, or luminosity, yet this is not the realization of its totality.Exalted bodhisattvas realize a portion of this buddha nature yet do not realizeit exactly as it is. The Great Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse states:Child of the enlightened heritage, it is like this: for example, imagine that avisually impaired person who wishes to be cured goes to a skilled doctor’soffice. The doctor takes a golden scalpel, removes the cataracts, then holds upa single finger. The patient says, “I can’t see that.” When the doctor holds uptwo or three fingers, the patient says, “I can vaguely see two or threefingers.”Child of the enlightened heritage, if I do not relate this Discourse of theComplete Great Transcendence of Sorrow, limitless bodhisattvas can complete theperfections and rest on the tenth stage of awakening, yet not see the nature ofenlightenment, like that blind person. If the Transcendent Buddha speaks, theycan vaguely see it.The Great Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse also states:The Honored One addressed Kashyapa, “Child of the enlightened heritage, it’slike this: Imagine that a king had an athlete who wore a jeweled vajra on hisforehead. During a competition, he hit another athlete’s head with his, and thejewel was forced beneath his skin, although the athlete did not know where ithad gone. Since there was a scar, a doctor was called and ordered to cure him.The doctor was very skilled and knew that the scar was due to the jewel havingpenetrated the skin. He did not apply medicine but said, “Oh, strong man, I knowwhere the jewel on your forehead has gone.” The athlete replied, anxiously, “Itwould be better if that jewel on my forehead had not gone anywhere. Without it,I wonder whether life is an illusion, and I have become very sorrowful.” Thenthe doctor tried to make the athlete happy by saying, “Don’t be anxious! Duringyour competition the jewel went under your skin. There’s only a reflection of itshowing. During the competition, you were angry and didn’t feel the jewel gounder your skin.” The athlete did not believe him, “Doctor! Don’t tell me lies!If the jewel went under my skin, it would have stirred up pus and blood. It’simpossible for its reflection to appear outside.” The doctor then placed amirror in front of him: the athlete clearly saw the jewel, was awestruck, andfilled with wonder.Child of the enlightened heritage, all sentient beings are like that athlete.Even though they have an enlightened nature, they are unable to see it becausethey have not honored spiritual guides. Overcome by obscurations due to desire,anger, and stupidity, beings in many different forms circle and suffer withinthe round of rebirth.Further, the same text states:However, child of the enlightened heritage, within the body of each sentientbeing there exist the ten forces, the thirty-two marks, and the eighty signs ofthe physical perfection of enlightenment.The Great Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse also states:Child of the enlightened heritage! Further, it’s like this: Imagine a womanwhose infant was struck by a disease that infected his mouth. The woman,tormented by anxiety, found a doctor. The doctor told her to give the child amedicine mixed with butter, milk, and molasses, and gave her the followingorder: “While your child takes this medicine and until it’s finished, youmustn’t give your own milk.” To prevent the child from wanting her milk, sherubbed bile on her breasts, thinking, “If I rub this poison on my breasts, mychild won’t want them.” As she expected, when the child was thirsty and wantedto nurse, the taste of her breasts made the child immediately unable to drink.Once the child had finished the medicine, she washed her breasts and said, “Comehere, come and nurse now.” But even though the child was very thirsty, thechild’s memory of the taste made it impossible to accept. The mother thenexplained to the child, “Before, you were taking medicine and you were notallowed to drink my milk so I spread bile on my breasts. Now you’ve finishedyour medicine and you’ve washed your mouth; there’s no more bad taste.” Then,the child carefully, gradually approached and was able to nurse.Child of the enlightened heritage, in order that all sentient beings beliberated, the Transcendent One emphasized the teaching on the lack of anexistent self. Based on their intense practice of that teaching, beings willhave no thought of self and will completely transcend sorrow. In order to removethe negative views of worldly nihilistic philosophy, you meditate on the lack ofan existent self and thus your body becomes completely pure. Just as that womanrubbed bile on her breasts for the good of her child, the Transcendent One doesthe same: in order that beings meditate on emptiness, he teaches that allphenomena lack an existent self. Then, just as the woman washed her breasts,called her child, and said, “Now you can nurse,” I now teach instructions onbuddha nature.Fully ordained ones! Don’t be afraid! Just as the mother calls her child, whogradually nurses, you fully ordained individuals must discern the teachings.Buddha nature is not a negation. Within the discourses on the transcendentperfections that I related in the past, I taught emptiness; however, you shouldunderstand that I did so only with the thought to present the self’s lack of anintrinsic nature. Apart from that, meditation on void emptiness cannot produceenlightenment’s bodies and wisdom, just as a fruit corresponds to its seed.Therefore, this teaching describes emptiness as the emptiness of appearingphenomena. From the moment of their appearance, they are empty of embellishmentscaused by clinging to them as single or as multiple, and they are empty from theperspective of each phenomenon’s essence, like reflections in a mirror. It doesnot describe emptiness as a final void of nothing whatsoever or, in relation tothe appearances of delusion, as the nonexistence of something that once existedin the beginning or in the present.Classification of the Enlightened Heritage Based on Metaphors and Meaning [c]This section has three parts: (1) metaphors for the enlightened heritage andtheir meanings, (2) names for the enlightened heritage, and (3) how theessential nature is realized.Metaphors for the Enlightened Heritage and Their Meanings [i]Butter, a lamp, a jewel, gold, grain,And fruit: these six metaphors illustrate the basis, path, and result.A buddha within a lotus, bees and honey,Grain in a husk, gold in filth,A buried treasure, a sprout from a seed,A jeweled image in rags, a sovereign in the womb,Gold covered with earth: these are nine metaphors of the meaning.From among explanations in treatises that elucidate the correct, definitivemeaning taught in the final cycle of the doctrine, Praise of the Basic Space ofPhenomena states:Butter’s essence does not appearWhen mixed in milk;Likewise, the basic space of phenomena is not seenWhen mixed with the mental afflictions.When milk is churnedButter’s essence becomes pure;Likewise, when the mental afflictions are refined,The basic space of phenomena becomes extremely pure.A lamp placed inside a vaseDoes not shine in the least;Likewise, when placed within the vase of the mental afflictions,The basic space of phenomena is not seen.Light will naturally shineFrom the exact pointWhere a hole is madeIn the vase;Likewise, at the moment the vajra of meditative statesPierces the vase of the mental afflictions,The bounds of spaceAre illuminated.Precious lapis lazuliAlways glows,But when covered by rocksIts radiance is not apparent; Likewise, the extremely pure basic space ofphenomena,Obscured by the mental afflictions,Cannot shine within the round of rebirth,But when transcendence is reached, it radiates.When gold lies within ore,Refinement of the ore will make it visible.Without the constituent of gold, you can refine oreBut will produce mental afflictions, and nothing more.When covered by a husk,Grain is invisible;Likewise, what is covered by the mental afflictionsIs not called “enlightenment.”When the husk is removed,Grain appears;Likewise, when the mental afflictions are removed,The ultimate body of enlightenment fully manifests.Plantain is said to be hollow,A metaphor for the world.But its essence is the fruit,Which is first eaten.When the hollow round of rebirthIs separated from the husks of the mental afflictions,Its fruit is enlightenment itself,Nectar for all embodied beings.Each of these six metaphors—butter, a lamp, a jewel, gold, grain, andfruit—symbolize the contexts of the basis, path, and result.Among the following nine metaphors taught by Maitreya, four symbolize buddhanature that rests within the four impurities that obscure the mind ofindividuals in four circumstances: before having entered the path, havingentered, on the path of cultivation, and on the path of application.First, buddha nature that lies within the confines of the propensity towarddesire can be likened to a buddha hidden in a lotus bud. The Highest Continuitystates:A faded lotusCan hold a transcendent buddha who shines with a thousand marks of physicalperfection.A human being endowed with stainless, divine sight could see the buddha,And remove him from the lotus bud.Likewise, blissful buddhas, with the eyes of enlightenment, see their own natureEven in beings who live in the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment.Their unobscured nondual compassion that lasts until the very end of timeLiberates us from obscurations.Second, the enlightened heritage, innate constituent enlightenment, that dwellswithin the confines of the propensity toward anger can be likened to honey. Thesame text states:When intelligent persons looking for honeySee it surrounded by a mass of bees,They do what they can to use skillful means to separate that honeyFrom the swarm of bees.Likewise, the Great Seer endowed with omniscienceSees the enlightened heritage, innate constituent enlightenment, like honey,Surrounded by obscurations, like bees,Which he forever renounces.Third, buddha nature within the confines of the latent propensity towardstupidity can be likened to a fruit inside its peel. The same text states:The core of a fruit, when in its peel,Cannot be enjoyed by anyone:Anyone who strives to eat itMust remove it from the peel.Likewise, as long as victors,Mixed with the stains of sentient beings’ mental afflictions,Are not liberated from the mental afflictions’ stains,They cannot perform victors’ acts within the three planes of existence.Fourth, buddha nature that dwells within the confines of the state of the actualarousal of intense desire, anger, and stupidity, the three poisons, is like goldin mud. The same text states:During a journey, a person’s goldCan drop into rotten mireAnd, since it is indestructible, remain thereUnchanged for many hundreds of years.Gods with pure divine sight can see the goldAnd tell someone its location,That they might clean it and use this supreme wealthFor their own purposes.Likewise, the Sage sees the positive qualities of sentient beingsSunk in the mud of mental afflictions, like filth.To purify the mire of mental afflictions,He causes the rain of the sacred doctrine to fall on beings.Fifth, the innate constituent enlightenment that lies within the confines of thepropensity toward ignorance of listener and solitary sage arhats is like atreasure buried in the earth. The same text states:An inexhaustible treasureCan be buried under a pauper’s homeBut the family does not know it,Nor can the treasure announce its own presence.Likewise, the mind contains a treasure of jewels—The nature of reality, pure, to which nothing needs to be added or removed—But without realization of that treasure,Beings experience continual, myriad forms of the suffering of poverty.Sixth, the essence that lies within the confines of impurities renounced on thepath of seeing is illustrated by the metaphor of a peel-covered seed thatsprouts into a tree. The same text states:Fruit, such as a mango,Contains an indestructible seed that will sproutAnd, if nourished by conditions, such as earth, cultivation, and water,Will gradually grow into the sovereign among trees.Within sentient beings’ peel, including ignorance,Lies their nature, the ennobling innate constituent enlightenment.Likewise, by relying on ennobling circumstances,A being will gradually become an actual sovereign sage.Seventh, the second metaphor of impurities renounced on the path of seeing is ajeweled image covered in rags. The same text states:The gods can see by the roadsideAn image of the Victor made of jewelsCovered in filthy, stinking rags,And indicate this to humans, to free the image.Likewise, those of unobstructed visionSee even in animals the true blissful buddhasCovered in various ways by mental afflictions,And teach skillful means to free them.Eighth, there are two metaphors for our nature, the ennobling innate constituentenlightenment that rests within the confines of the stains renounced on the pathof meditation. The first is a ruler who gestates within the womb of ahandicapped woman. The same text states:A handicapped woman who has no protector,Who lives where any destitute person may stay,Might hold in her womb a glorious monarch,But remain unconscious that such a leader dwells within her own body.Likewise, those born into existence, a home for the destitute,Impure sentient beings, are like that pregnant woman:What they possess will become a protection—The pure innate constituent enlightenment inside them, as if in their own womb.Ninth, the second metaphor for impurities renounced on the path of meditation isa golden image covered by its clay mold. The same text states:A splendid, peaceful molten gold imageCan lie covered with clay.Those who can see and know its presenceWill remove the outer covering to clean the gold within.Likewise, those who have sublime awakeningSee the mind’s nature of pure luminosity covered by incidental defilementsAnd will purify the obscurationsIn beings, who are like a mine of jewels.Here, four metaphors—a lotus, bees, a peel, and mud—illustrate the obscurationsto innate constituent enlightenment present in sentient beings. The singlemetaphor of buried treasure illustrates its presence in the streams of being ofarhats among hearers and solitary sages. The two metaphors of a husk and ragsillustrate respectively impurities renounced on the great way path of seeing,present within the stream of being of ordinary individuals engaged in training,and impurities renounced on the path of meditation, present within exaltedindividuals’ stream of being. The two metaphors of a womb and gold covered withclay illustrate respectively the impurities of those who rest on awakening’s tenstages (or of those who rest on awakening’s initial seven impure stages), and ofthose who rest on awakening’s final three pure stages.Names for the Enlightened Heritage [ii]The basic space of phenomena, enlightenment, buddha nature, innate constituentenlightenment, ultimate truth,Radiant wisdom, emptiness, perfection of sublime insight, true nature.We distinguish names for the enlightened heritage as follows. It is called thebasic space of phenomena, since its realization is the basis for transcendentstates, whereas when it is not realized, the round of rebirth arises. It iscalled natural, ever-present enlightenment, since it is a natural attribute inbeings, primordial and noncomposite. It is called buddha nature, since allqualities of enlightenment are present within it. It is called innateconstituent enlightenment or ultimate ground, from the perspective of obscuringimpurities. It is called ultimate truth, since it is the abiding nature. It iscalled luminous wisdom, since it is originally pure. It is called profoundemptiness, the nature of the middle way, since it transcends the extremes ofexistence and nonexistence based in exaggeration or deprecation. It is calledperfection of sublime insight, since it is free from all formulated extremes. Itis called inseparable truths, since it is nondual clarity and emptiness. It iscalled true nature, since its characteristics are without change or transition.How the Essential Nature Is Realized [iii]The innate constituent enlightenment can be believed in, partially seen, ormanifest.Thus, that innate constituent enlightenment as described, the essence ofawakening, is ever present in beings. Moreover, from the perspective of itsintrinsic purity and its endowment with every quality, it is called the natureof the body of ultimate enlightenment. This is shown by the three metaphors ofthe Buddha in a lotus, honey, and grain.From the perspective of its unchanging, noncomposite aspect, and to indicate itspresence within us, it is called the intrinsic true nature, shown by the singlemetaphor of gold. From the perspective of the wisdom bodies’ seeming developmentdue to removal of impurities during training on the path, it is called thenature of the enlightened heritage, shown by the metaphors of treasure, a tree,a jeweled image, a universal monarch, and a golden image.Concerning the innate constituent enlightenment’s ultimate essence, persons onthe paths of cultivation and application intellectually believe, “It definitelyexists,” but do not actually see it. Once they reach awakening’s first stage,they partially see it. At the stage of enlightenment, whatever constitutes itsnature becomes directly manifest, thus nondually seen. Since this basic space ofphenomena is the ultimate truth, seeing its nature is called sight of ultimatetruth. Nothingness (literally, “the emptiness of nothing whatsoever”) is not theultimate truth. Such subjects as the lack of an existent self are taught tobeginners or to ordinary, spiritually immature individuals, as remedies fortheir attachment to a sense of self as existent. In fact, it should beunderstood that the basic space of phenomena, noncomposite luminosity, is everpresent.Proofs Based on Instruction in the Enlightened Heritage [4]Empty of faults and formations, the enlightened heritage’s qualities arecomplete.Once the five mistakes are corrected, one works joyfully and energetically forthe good of others.This section has two parts, questions asked to remove philosophical doubtsconcerning the enlightened heritage itself and replies to such doubts.First, doubts could be formulated as follows: “The doctrine’s middle cycleteaches that all phenomena are impermanent, like clouds; unreal, like dreams; acollection of causes and conditions yet lacking an intrinsic nature, like amagic display, and so on. However, in this final cycle, they are described asprimordial, eternally existent, thus permanent; abiding in their intrinsicnature, thus isolated; not produced by causes and conditions, thus noncomposite.Aren’t these two cycles’ views contradictory?”Second, when doubts such as these arise for those of average intellect, thereply is as follows: This buddha nature is empty, since it is empty of faultsand composite formations; but is not empty as if devoid of its own positivequalities. The correct conclusion is that the naturally pure innate constituentenlightenment is noncomposite, like space; whereas the contents that appear insuch space—karma, mental afflictions, and the happiness and sufferings of theround of rebirth—appear like clouds.Concerning this, it is taught that suffering produced by dysfunctional mentalactivity related to mental afflictions is like clouds; karma, appearanceswithout an intrinsic nature, like forms in a dream; and the psychophysicalaggregations created by karma and mental afflictions, like a magic display or anemanation. These teachings remedy clinging to the single extreme of manifestattachment to a sense of an existent self. Subsequently, five mistakes mightarise, such as attachment due to an exaggerated clinging to the extreme ofemptiness. To correct these faults, the ultimate, innate constituentenlightenment, buddha nature, is taught.What are the five mistakes? They are as follows. You do not see that you havethe essence of awakening, and conclude, “Someone like me cannot attainenlightenment.” This defeatist attitude prevents you from uplifting your mind toawakening. Even though you have uplifted it, you conclude, “I am a bodhisattva;others are ordinary persons.” This contempt for sentient beings prevents youraccess to higher paths. You cling to the extreme of emptiness and thereby do notcomprehend the ultimate nature, the basic space of phenomena, and do not holdcorrect views. You fall into extreme views of eternalism or nihilism anddisparage correct teaching. You do not see yourself and sentient beings asequals and thus cling to duality.If you know that this innate constituent enlightenment is ever present inyourself and others, you can conclude that your own mind can attain freedomwithout difficulty, and you become joyful in that knowledge. With respect towardall sentient beings as toward the Buddha, not only are you not malicious orharmful, you help others. In the expanding circles of sublime insight born ofthe realization of the ultimate basic space, wisdom that sees the nature ofmind, and immeasurable love, you become capable of acting to serve others.Readers should note that I have presented this explanation of the enlightenedheritage entirely from the perspective of the teachings’ definitive meaning,without consideration of the provisional meaning. Since this subject isparticularly crucial to the great way and is difficult to understand, I havepresented it here in detail.An Explanation of Relative Truth [C]Under the heading of relative truth, there is its essence, definition of theterm,Characteristics, and two categories of its classification—genuine andmisleading.The essence of relative truth is the mental domain created by the rationaldualistic mind and the senses. The conceptual domain, senses, and mentalactivity are the relative, and are entirely perception within the confines ofdelusion.The definition of the term relative truth is that which is without an intrinsicnature within appearances that are illusory, thus relative. In the face ofmomentary delusion, the individual traits of these appearances are seen to bereliable, and are called “truth.” This term includes all aspects of theattachment to the reality of what appears in the domain of the rationaldualistic mind, as well as myriad appearances. Within the domain of appearances,no truth or falseness, delusion or lack of delusion whatsoever exists since ithas no intrinsic nature. Should you think, “Yet, my rational dualistic mindperceives these appearances: my senses, my consciousness, and external phenomenaexist,” in the circumstance of attachment to experience based in dualisticclinging, this constitutes the aspect of subjective clinging, which we label“relative.”The characteristic of relative truth is phenomena that do not surpass therational dualistic mind’s domain and that cannot forbear examination. Itsclassification is an ancillary subject, based on the understanding ofterminology within the range of designations in the context of the relative,such terms as are adapted to worldly judgments of truth or falseness. This hastwo categories: first, genuine relative truth corresponds to the forms, sounds,smells, tastes, sensations, and phenomena that appear in the domains of theunimpaired six senses. Second, misleading relative truth corresponds todisturbed appearances due to impaired senses—such as images of floating andmelting forms.I have presented this subject of relative truth here as it definitelycontradicts ultimate truth.THE DOCTRINE’S MIDDLE CYCLE, THE BUDDHA’S PAST LIVES, AND MENTAL TRAINING BYMEANS OF THE FOUR IMMEASURABLE ASPIRATIONS [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-32]This chapter has three parts: (1) the turning of the doctrine’s middle cycle andits compilation, (2) the Buddha’s past lives, and (3) mental training by meansof the four immeasurable aspirations.The Turning of the Doctrine’s Middle Cycle and Its Compilation [A]On Vulture Peak, Powerful Sage (Shakyamuni)Turned the doctrine’s middle cycle, that of absence of characteristics,For those endowed with the great way’s enlightened heritage.His teachings compiled by Gentle Melody (Manjugosha), explained by Nagarjuna andhis spiritual heirs,And expounded by Shantideva are the profound view tradition.His teachings compiled by Loving Kindness (Maitreya), explained by Asanga andhis brother,And expounded by Lord Atisha are the vast activity tradition.Lotus-Born’s personal tradition concurs with the profound view tradition.The original translations have twenty-three discourses in this cycle, includingThe Lengthy Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand andTwenty-Five Thousand Stanzas,The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eighteen Thousand Stanzas, in Ten Thousand,Eight Thousand,Seven Hundred, Five Hundred, Three Hundred, and One Hundred Stanzas.The original translations also include 197 treatises of commentary.On Vulture Peak, Honored Powerful Sage (Shakyamuni) turned the doctrine’s middlecycle, that of absence of characteristics, for a circle of disciples endowedwith the great way’s enlightened heritage.

He vowed:Blissful Buddha, be it your wisdom body,Be it your entourage, life span, pure land,Or sublime, excellent name:May I become exactly like you!He was also known as he who, on meeting a buddha, offered a full bowl of smoothsoup and five shells as a flower.Likewise, when our Buddha in another life was the merchant Excellent Knowledge,he uplifted his mind in the presence of the Buddha Jewel Branch. When he wasKing Virtuous, he uplifted his mind in the presence of the Buddha BeautifulLight. The Fortunate Eon Discourse states:Before, when I was an inferior person,I offered one full bowl of soupTo the Transcendent Buddha ShakyamuniAnd for the first time uplifted my mind to awakening.The General Way the Buddha Cultivated Goodness and Wisdom [2]He then traversed the paths of cultivation and application by honoringfifty-five thousand victors;He reached the seventh stage of awakening by honoring sixty-six thousandvictors;And completed the tenth stage of awakening by honoring seventy-seven thousandvictors.These three progressions lasted a total of three great incalculable eons.During the first great incalculable eon, the future Buddha Shakyamuni perfectlycultivated goodness and wisdom, such as honoring fifty-five thousand victors,including Guardian of the Region and Surroundings. He thus actualized the threelevels of the path of cultivation and the four levels of the path ofapplication. The Basic Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct states:During the first incalculable eon,I honoredFifty-five thousand buddhas,From the guide Guardian of the Region and SurroundingsTo the sage Powerful Banner.I did so without any regret.During the second incalculable eon, he honored sixty-six thousand victors,including Buddha Fine Deeds, and completely traversed the first to the seventhstages of awakening. The same text states:From Buddha Fine DeedsUntil the guide All-Seeing,I honoredSixty-six thousand buddhas.I did so without any regret.During the third incalculable eon, he honored seventy-seven thousand victors,from Buddha Lamp Giver to Light Guardian. Due to this cultivation of the sourceof ennobling acts, he actualized awakening’s three pure stages. The same textstates:From the Buddha Lamp GiverUntil the victor Light Guardian,I honoredSeventy-seven thousand buddhas.I did so without any regret.A Specific Description of Thirty-Four Past Lives [3]This section presents three sets of ten and one set of four:The First Set of TenThirty-four lifetimes from among the past lives of the Buddha:(1) Born into a brahmin family, he became a renunciant and kept a circle ofdisciples.Then, out of compassion, he gave his body to a tigress.(2) As king of Shibi, he gave whatever was wished:To a brahmin he gave his eyes. By his declaration of truth, he gained divinesight.(3) As king of Kosala,He remembered a past life and recounted that his position was the consequence ofa gift of warm food.(4) As the merchant Courage in Giving, he crossed the fires of hellTo offer alms to a solitary sage.(5) As the merchant Invincible, although his wealth was exhausted,He offered his profits from selling grass: the god blessed him with endless andincreasing wealth.(6) As a rabbit, he gave spiritual teaching to an otter, a jackal, and a monkey.He leapt into a fire: the gods gave him gifts and praise.(7) As the brahmin Agastya, when staying in retreat,His food became depleted; he offered leaves to his guest, Shakra.(8) As King Force of Love, by his gift of his own flesh and bloodTo five noxious spirits, they became the five excellent individuals.(9) As the prince All-Liberating, he offered everything—An elephant; then sons, daughters, and wife.(10) As King Maker of Gifts and Offerings, he skillfullyTurned his subjects away from wrongdoing and led them to joy and happiness.(1) The First Past Life Recounted, the Gift of the BodyBorn into a brahmin family, the Bodhisattva (that is, the Buddha in a past life)learned such subjects as the eighteen arts and sciences, but became arenunciant. In a forest retreat, he gave many teachings to his circle ofdisciples. In the forest lived a starving tigress whom he witnessed eating herown cubs. Moved by immeasurable compassion, he gave his body to the tigress, tohelp persons of future generations develop courage when their energeticapplication and will for the instructions weaken. That gift caused the gods,nagas, and noxious spirits to shower him with a huge rain of offerings. Thefirst tale of past lives states:28 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st28]May this help beings in every situation,Making them forever happy.When I am certain an act will aid others,I am thoroughly joyful, even if it costs me my life!(2) The Gift of EyesAs king of the land of the Shibi, the Bodhisattva distributed gifts of whateveranyone wished, such as food, drink, bedding, furniture, clothes, ornaments,gold, and silver. While satisfying the people’s wishes, he reflected that thegift of his own body would be more valuable than gifts of wealth. At thatthought, the great earth trembled and the god Shakra (Indra) transformed himselfinto a blind brahmin. To test the king’s motivation, he begged for the king’seyes. The king gave them; the beggar gained sight, and left. Again, to test theking’s joy in giving, Shakra asked him questions. By the power of the king’sdeclaration of the truth, the king regained his sight, the earth shook, and thegods presented him with offerings and praises. He attained divine sight andbecame able to see as far as the rocky mountains that lined the horizon at adistance of one hundred leagues.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to make known that true words areinfallible. The second tale of past lives states:Brahmin, I will grant the hopesYou had in mind, which brought you here.You wished for one of my eyes,But I will give you both!(3) The Gift of Warm FoodAs king of the region of Kosala, the Bodhisattva remembered that his positionwas due to the consequence of his gift of a handful of warm food during a pastlife. He remarked,In the past, I heard that even minor service offered to the joyful buddhasWould not reap a small reward:Look at this majestic wealth of mine,The result of a handful of coarse, unsalted food!I have many chariots, horses, and swaggering elephants;My massive army, my wide dominion,Great splendors of wealth, my attractive queen—behold, so much!All the excellent effects accomplished by the gift of one handful of warm food!The king related this to his officials, subjects, and queen, and she in turnrecalled that she was born queen due to the gift of a handful of food she hadmade during a past lifetime as a servant.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to make known that a smalloffering to a sublime recipient produces a vast result.(4) To Cross the Fires of Hell to Make a GiftAs the merchant Joy in Giving, the Bodhisattva made extensive gifts to the poorof whatever they wanted. While he was eating, a solitary sage came begging tohis door. Demons obstructed his offering of fine food and drink by emanatingintensely blazing hellfires between them. He refused to allow his gift to beprevented, crossed the fires, and made offerings to the solitary sage.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to make known that even thoughhellfire or other obstacles to the cultivation of goodness arise, you mustdevelop courage to cultivate goodness. The fourth tale of past lives states:When the poor come to beg politely and confidently,I would rather be burned in flames and fall up to my headIn these unbearable fires of hellThan to scorn the opportunity to give and decide against it.(5) Giving the Profit of Selling GrassAs the merchant Invincible, the Bodhisattva decided to make gifts without greed,since he concluded that to squander wealth meaninglessly increases attachment,the cause of rebirth in the miserable realms. When he gave gifts to satisfy thedesires of beggars, Shakra tested his motivation by destroying his family’swealth, leaving only a scythe and a rope. The merchant used these to collectgrass and made gifts with the profit from its sale. Shakra told him that if hestopped exerting himself in generosity, the family’s fortune would grow, but hedid not listen: his enjoyment in giving increased. Shakra returned the family’swealth he had hidden and caused it to become endless and ever-increasing.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to prevent fear that generositymight exhaust wealth and to teach that one must give without attachment towealth. The fifth tale of past lives states:The source of happiness is generosity.What good person treads the path of greed?(6) The Rabbit’s Gift of His BodyAs a rabbit, the Bodhisattva gave spiritual teachings to an otter, a jackal, anda monkey, and they thus refrained from harming living beings. The rabbit thoughtthat if a guest came, there would be no food or gift in welcome. He then decidedto offer his own body to a guest with the thought that his body would thereby beuseful. At that thought, the earth shook. Shakra knew the reason for this andtook the form of a brahmin who claimed to have lost his way and come into theforest, and to be afflicted by hunger and thirst. The rabbit told him, “Guest, Igive you my body. Eat!” Shakra emanated a fire and the rabbit jumped into it.Shakra grabbed him and carried him to the gods’ realm and presented him to thegods. They used the rabbit’s image to ornament the excellent palace, TotalVictory; the Hall of Excellent Instruction; and the circle of the moon.29[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st29]The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to encourage exertion ingenerosity while a human being, since bodhisattvas even as animals feel inclinedtoward generosity and take joy in its positive qualities. The sixth tale of pastlives states:A rabbit of the forest owns nothing whatsoever,Not even beans, sesame, or grain.Take my body burned in the fireAnd stay today in the forest to engage in ascetic practice.(7) The Gift of LeavesAs Brahmin Agasti, the Bodhisattva studied the Vedas and related subjects, sawthe householder life to be the source of many faults, and became a renunciant.He lived happily in a forest filled with flowers, leaves, and fruit. He servedflowers, fruit, and other things to those who came to visit him. To test him,the sovereign god Shakra destroyed all edible roots and fruits in that region,in order that the Bodhisattva practice the asceticism of food. He then cookedand ate the fresh leaves of trees. Again Shakra destroyed all the tree leaves inthat place. He had to gather a few remaining old leaves to eat; however, he didso without distaste, as if enjoying nectar. Shakra manifested in the form of abrahmin who visited him: he cooked the leaves he had collected and offered themto the brahmin. At this, the god extensively praised him and his supremegenerosity.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to encourage gifts of whateverfood or wealth you have. The seventh tale of past lives states:An erudite person without arrogance,A wealthy person without greed,A forest-dweller who has contentment:These are sublime ornaments of positive qualities!(8) The Gift of Flesh and BloodAs King Force of Love, the Bodhisattva ensured that his subjects lived incomfort and happiness. Five brothers, noxious spirits, came to his country andbegged food from the king. He gave them food but they did not want it: theybegged for the warm flesh and blood of a human being. The king gave his bloodand cut a piece of his flesh as ransom: they ate this and were satisfied by hisgift. The brothers promised not to harm human beings and aspired to become thefirst disciples of the king when he turned the wheel of the doctrine as aBuddha. The king promised it would be so; as a result, they later became thefive excellent individuals, the first of Buddha Shakyamuni’s circle ofdisciples.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to praise those who give toappease others’ suffering without regard to their own. The eighth tale of pastlives states:By this goodness, once I have attained the state of omniscienceAnd have subdued all my faults, which are my enemies,I wish to draw beings from the seas of lifeTossed by waves of aging, sickness, and death.(9) The Gifts of an Elephant, Children, and WifeAs Prince All-Liberating, the Bodhisattva made extensive gifts to beggars ofwhatever they wished. Another king made a request for the kingdom’s supreme,perfumed elephant, which he gave. According to the strict laws of the land, hewas then exiled. On his way to Mount Vanka with his wife, son, and daughter,they traveled in a chariot. When a brahmin asked for the horse that pulled thechariot, he gave it and the chariot. While living on the mountain, he gave hisson and daughter to an elderly brahmin. To test him, Shakra took the form of abrahmin who asked for his wife: he gave her. Shakra revealed his own form andreturned the wife. The son and daughter were ransomed from the brahmin by theircountry’s king, and the prince was invited back to the kingdom to rule.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that if you can take joyin giving what is difficult to give, you should develop joy in other forms ofgenerosity. The ninth tale of past lives states:To a brahmin who visited, assailed by the sufferingOf aging and poverty,I gave our two children.Don’t be distressed, be joyful!(10) Skillful Leading of His Subjects to HappinessAs King Maker of Gifts and Offerings, the Bodhisattva’s land suffered fromdrought. His officials and subjects said that it was necessary to kill manyanimals to make offerings. This displeased the king, who decided to actskillfully. He said, “Now we must make an offering of one thousand human beings.Arrest all those who do corrupting acts and we’ll offer them!” Everyone becameafraid for their own lives and stopped corrupting wrongdoing and only actedvigorously in ennobling acts.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that the fault of killinglivestock or other animals creates the experience of various sufferings withoutany happiness; instead you must make the fate of animals part of your concerns.The tenth tale of past lives states:Fortunate are thoseTo whom you give refuge.Even fathers surelyDo not protect their children that well.The Second Set of Ten(11) As Shakra, he was left behind by the gods’ armies.To rescue a garuda, he turned around and scattered the demigods.(12) As a brahmin, his preceptor wished to test himAnd asked him to steal: when he refused, the teacher was pleased.(13) As a king, he desired an entrancing womanBut he bore what was unbearable and perfected patience.(14) As a traveler on an ocean ship blown off course,His declaration of truth returned it to home.(15) As a fish, to save the lives of fish when a lake dried up,His declaration of truth brought rain, saving them.(16) As a young pheasant, when the forest burned,His declaration of truth calmed the fire’s spread.(17) As Shakra, the force of his description of alcohol’s faultsLed the king, his court, and entourage to renounce alcohol and to applythemselves to ennobling acts.(18) As a wealthy man, he gave everything away and became a renunciant;He did not heed pleading to reconsider, but spoke of the many shortcomings ofhome life.(19) As a brahmin, his brothers, sisters, and servants all became renunciants.The lotus roots were hidden by Shakra, who asked forgiveness.(20) As a merchant chief, a minor event led him to retreat;He skillfully led his family and friends to renunciation.(11) As Shakra, Protection of a Garuda’s NestWhen the Bodhisattva was Shakra, sovereign of the gods, the demigods raised ahuge army. In response, the gods gathered an army of four divisions: cavalry,elephants, chariots, and foot soldiers. To lead them, Shakra mounted anexcellent golden chariot drawn by one thousand horses. In battle, the gods’forces were defeated and fled, leaving Shakra behind. The chariot’s driverrealized this and tried to turn the chariot around quickly, but Shakra saw thatthe point of the chariot’s yoke would strike a shalmali (silk cotton) tree trunkthat held a garuda’s nest, and risk killing the birds. He felt immensecompassion and ordered the driver to not continue but to return. The driverreplied, “If we don’t continue, the birds will be saved but the demigods’ armywill defeat us. We must surely continue.” Shakra said, “I prefer to be beaten todeath by the demigods than to harm those sentient creatures. Turn around!” Thechariot turned again toward the demigods’ army: seeing this, the demigods becameafraid, scattered, and ran. The gods’ armies witnessed this. They returned,praised Shakra, and were victorious in battle.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was that it is improper to harmsentient beings even for your life or country. The eleventh tale of past livesstates:It is easier for me to accept death by blows from demigods’ weaponsThan to live under the blows of contemptuous gossipFrom having killed these terror-stricken beings:Turn the chariot around!(12) To Not Steal Although Encouraged to Do SoAs a brahmin, the Bodhisattva studied the Vedas with a preceptor, whom he servedrespectfully. The preceptor wished to test the character of his students andcomplained to them that he was poor and decrepit. The students begged well forhim but the preceptor told them this would not make him rich. He said, “I’m oldand unable, but you’re young” and he taught them how to steal when destitute.“Steal valuables when no one is looking,” he advised. The other studentspromised to do so, but the Bodhisattva lowered his head and said nothing. Themaster said, “What’s the matter? Don’t you care about me?” He replied, “It’s notthat I don’t care! How is it possible that it be right to act improperly when noone is looking? I don’t wish to act wrongly. That’s why I was silent.” Themaster was pleased and said, “I was testing you. Wrongdoing is neveracceptable.” The preceptor was very pleased and cared for the Bodhisattva.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that shameful acts ofcorrupting wrongdoing are not right, whether done overtly or covertly. Thetwelfth tale of past lives states:It would be easier for me to take a clay pot, wear ragged clothes,And go begging for wealth at the home of an enemyThan to abandon shame and commit acts that contradict the doctrine,Even if such acts led to gaining sovereignty over heaven.(13) Forbearance of DesireWhen the Bodhisattva was king of the Shibi, one of his officials had a beautifuldaughter, as attractive as a goddess. Whoever saw her became mad with desire.She was known as “the Intoxicator.” The official told the king he would offerher to the king if he wished to marry her. The king asked his soothsayers ofphysiognomy for their advice. When the soothsayers saw the woman, they toobecame intrigued and as if intoxicated. They thought, “If this woman is offeredto the king, he will be beguiled and will ignore both religion and the kingdom.Therefore we should tell him the good omens are in fact unfavorable.” Theyrelated this to the king, who rejected the proposal of marriage. The woman thenbecame the wife of another official.Later, the king went to the town mounted on a chariot to see a Kaumudifestival.30 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st30] On his way he saw on the roof of ahouse an entrancing woman, as beautiful as a goddess, and fell in love with her.He did not want the chariot to proceed, and continued gazing at her as itreturned to the palace, where he asked the chariot driver about her. When heunderstood that she was another’s wife, he gave up hope. In anguish, he grewthin and pallid. When the official became aware of this, he said, “Lord, if yourheart is inclined to my wife, I offer her to you as your queen.” The king didnot accept, saying, “It is wrong for a king to steal his official’s wife.”Although the official requested in many ways, the king said, “Even thoughsomeone desires another’s spouse, if they take that person as their own, this iswrongful sexual activity. Therefore, I cannot accept her.” The official said,“If my wife becomes a prostitute who can be anyone’s partner, you could accepther and this will not contradict either religious or worldly customs. How aboutthat?” The king replied, “My friend, however you separate from your wife, if Ithen accept her as my own, it is very wrong. There’s no way.” Even though hisheart was full of desire for her, he refused.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that you have to developsupreme forbearance in relation to particular desires that prove practicallyirresistible. The thirteenth tale of past lives states:It is easier for me to cut myself with a sharp weaponOr to throw myself onto a blazing fireThan to suppress my spiritual practice,Source of my present splendor.(14) Turning a Boat toward Home by a Declaration of TruthAs a captain named Good Crossing, the Bodhisattva took many merchants in hisboat on the great ocean. After they had set sail, turbulent winds made them fearthe boat would break up and all were panicked, but he reassured them. Thecaptain said, “We must try hard to leave this Razor Crest Sea!” but then aviolent wind from the west arose and they were unable to change course. Theywere equally unable to steer out of the Yogurt Crest Sea and were pushed by thewind to the sea of red water, called Fire Crest Sea. They traveled onward to theKusha Grass Crest Sea and from there to the Reed Crest Sea. There, it was as ifthe ocean was turning itself upside down; the roar was like a heavy hailstorm orlike a bamboo forest in flames; the water rushed about them as if it had fallenfrom a cliff or down a ravine. In fear, they asked the captain, who with greatcompassion made a declaration of truth: “I have never killed another being. Bythis truth, may our boat return.” By the force of his declaration, the shipchanged course. The captain told the merchants to haul as much sand and stonesas they could onto the ship, to fill it, which they did. The ship returned totheir homeland that evening and they found their ship was filled with gems.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was that words of truth accomplishsignificant acts and that their result is inconceivable. The fourteenth tale ofpast lives states:I cannot recall ever having killedAny living being.By the force of these true wordsAnd my goodness,May our boat return to safetyBefore erring into the ocean’s abyss.(15) Saving Fish by a Declaration of TruthAs king of fish, the Bodhisattva taught the Buddhist doctrine to the fish of hislake, so that they stopped harming one another. The sun at the end of springtimewas extremely hot, and dried the lake. The fish were hunted as food by manybirds. With intense compassion, the Bodhisattva made a declaration of truth: thegods made the rain fall and the lake filled. Shakra became aware of this, wentthere, lauded the fish and said, “I will ensure that from now on this place willnever experience calamities.”The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that for persons endowedwith ethical conduct, this life will be happy and the series of their otherlifetimes will definitely be happy. The fifteenth tale of past lives states:I do not recall ever intentionally killing another living being,Even when my situation was desperate.By this truth, may the sovereign godsMake rain fall to fill this lake.(16) Truth Extinguishes a FireAs a young pheasant, since the Bodhisattva ate no insects but only fruit, hisstrength did not develop. When a forest fire approached, others were able to flyaway but he was unable to follow. He made a declaration of the truth and thefire was calmed.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that you should bediligent in the truth since even fire does not surpass the power of words whenthe ennobling conduct of true words is practiced. The sixteenth tale of pastlives states:My legs’ name has no meaning; I have no wings.In fear of you, my father and mother have fled.I have nothing suitable to offer you, my guest,Therefore, fire, you should turn back.(17) Leading Others to Ennobling Acts by Relating the Faults of AlcoholWhen the Bodhisattva was Shakra, a king named Everyone’s Friend and his courtdrank uninhibitedly. The Bodhisattva emanated near them in Brahma’s form holdinga vase filled with alcohol. He sat in the sky before them; they were amazed andmoved to faith. Brahma said, “Buy this vase!” “What’s in it?” they asked.He replied,This vase is filled with the essence of wrongdoing. Listen to its qualities:Those who drink this will walk in a stupor, without self-control.They will wander, stumbling on even level ground, their memory impaired.Inattentive to what can be eaten or not, they will eat anything.Buy this vilest of vases filled with such things!The king understood that these words described the faults of alcohol. Freed ofattachment to alcohol, he offered his entire kingdom to Brahma, who refused itand disappeared. Then the king, his officials and subjects stopped drinkingalcohol.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was that it be known that alcohol, thebasis of many faults, must be renounced. The seventeenth tale of past livesstates:The complete ripening of drinking even a little alcoholIs that, even if born a human, you will have defective ethical conduct andviews.Wherever you go later, the fires of the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment will burnyou,You will be born in the land of starving spirits or of lowly animals.Your morality will be impaired, you will hear others’ low opinions of you.You will be shameless, your mind defiled.(18) Renunciation Even after a DelayAs a wealthy man of the aristocracy with many possessions, the Bodhisattva gavehis fortune of food and wealth to the poor and lived a life of correctmeditative stability in a forest sanctuary. In reply to his father’s friends,who praised the qualities of home life, he listed the many faults of such alife. Those friends all developed faith.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to demonstrate the faults of homelife and the positive qualities of retreat. The eighteenth tale of past livesstates:Home life is like prison:Never think of it as happy.Whether for a rich person or the poor,Life at home is a great malady.(19) Forbearance Even When without FoodAs a brahmin, the Bodhisattva had six brothers and one sister. After theirparents died, the older brother saw the faults of home life and consideredbecoming a renunciant. His younger brothers tried various ways to discouragehim, but in the end they were unsuccessful: the seven brothers, the sister,their friends, and male and female servants became renunciants together andlived in retreat, each in a hut made of leaves, on the bank of a lake. They atelotus roots and every five days gathered to listen to the Bodhisattva’steachings.They divided and shared the lotus roots, and took their portion each day. Totest the eldest brother, Shakra hid his share. Although he thought that someoneelse had taken his share, he said nothing, and lived without mental agitation.His body deteriorated and he grew thin. His siblings and the others saw this,asked him about his health, and swore that they had not taken his food. WhenShakra showed his form, the Bodhisattva told him of the shortcomings of desire.Shakra was moved to faith, praised him, admitted his fault, returned the lotusroots, and asked forgiveness.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that you should not beangry if someone takes your food, even if you only have meager food for a lifeof spiritual austerity. The nineteenth tale of past lives states:Due to desire, you are bound to the world, killed,Tormented in anguish, and assailed by many fears.(20) To Enter Spiritual Life due to Minor EventsDuring the Bodhisattva’s lifetime as a king’s merchant chief, his motherin-lawwas talking casually to her daughter, didn’t hear the words spoken to her, andunderstood that her son-in-law would become a renunciant. She wailed. Her cryingwas heard by everyone, who joined her in exclamations of sadness and regret. Themerchant chief’s hearing this incited him to ask the king’s permission to becomea renunciant. His family tried various ways to prevent him, but he paid them noheed. He told them of the positive qualities of renunciation and the many faultsof home life, then left to engage in ascetic practice in the forest.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that you should enterspiritual life even due to a minor event. The twentieth tale of past livesstates:The cause of suffering in the next life and thisIs desire, in all its forms. Those who do not wish to renounce itOppose ascetic practice in the forestAnd today reject me—what folly!The Third Set of Ten(21) As Crown Ornament Awakening, he and his wife became renunciants.He was not angry at the king, who became his servant.(22) As the king of geese, after he was caught in a trap,He gave spiritual teachings to the king and his officials, who offered him giftsand praise.(23) As Great Awakening, he skillfully led the king and officialsAway from negative views to the excellent path.(24) As an ape, he led someone who had fallen down a cliff to safety.When the man tried to kill him, he compassionately showed the path home.(25) As a sharabha, he led a killer, a king who had fallen down a cliff,To safety and had him enter the spiritual path.(26) As a spotted deer, a person he saved from being carried away by a torrentRecounted the event. The king’s army surrounded him but was tamed by histeaching.(27) As a monkey, he made a path with his body on the treetops,Thus rescuing the pack of monkeys from danger and inspiring faith in thekingdom’s people.(28) As Patient Speech, a kingProvoked by desire and anger cut off his limbs. The earth opened and the kingfell.(29) As Brahma, he taught the truth to a king who held wrong views:He was moved to faith and led his subjects to ennobling acts.(30) As an elephant, he showed the path to seven hundred persons who had beenexiled to the wilderness;To feed them he jumped into a ravine, thus saving their lives.(21) To Not Be Angry at Harm DoneAs the brahmin Crown Ornament Awakening, the Bodhisattva abandoned theenjoyments of home life, became a renunciant, and went into retreat. His wifealso shaved her head, changed her clothing from that of a householder, andbecame a renunciant. He told her that life in the wilderness was arduous andthat she should not go. However, she followed him and they arrived in a pleasantforest where they dwelt. Before long, their daughter became a renunciant andstayed with them.The local king came to the forest and met the Bodhisattva. He was entranced bythe sight of the beautiful young woman renunciant and thought of kidnapping her.He talked with her at length and finally led the renunciant young woman away,where she was abducted and kept in his palace. The king thought to see whetheror not the true renunciant was angry at his daughter’s kidnapping. On askinghim, he found that he was not angry in the least: the Bodhisattva gave him manyteachings. The king was moved to faith, promised to serve him, and released theyoung woman.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that subduing your ownanger also subdues your enemies. The twenty-first tale of past lives states:Sharp pains of anger torment the mindAnd you ignore your own best interests.Anger’s intensity leads you along the path of wretchedness.It spoils your fame and success.(22) Pleasant Words Help You and OthersAs the king of geese, Guardian of the Land and Its Surroundings, the Bodhisattvahad a large court, including an official, Excellent Face. They lived together ona lake decorated with various flowers. The court lived in accord with thedoctrine and was praised by gods and seers. The human king Brahmadatta heardabout this and wished to see for himself. He commanded his court, saying that inhis city they should construct a beautiful lake decorated by various flowers.Other geese saw it and told their king: the king of geese went to the lake withhis officials and court. Brahmadatta was told of this and said that the birdsshould be captured by any means. A trapper set many traps and caught the king ofgeese. He said, “This lake of mine has become a dangerous place!” and the otherbirds flew away, yet his official did not flee. When the king saw that theofficial remained, he told him to escape, but still he stayed. The trapper askedExcellent Face why he had not fled and he replied in a truthful and pleasantmanner. The trapper had faith and respectfully brought him to the king. When theking asked the trapper why he had done so, the king was pleased and placed thebirds on a golden throne. The king of geese, his official, and the king talkedof many things among themselves, then the birds left for their flock. Later, thebirds came to give many teachings to the king. The king had faith andrespectfully made many offerings to the birds.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that pleasant words arebeneficial for yourself and others. The twenty-second tale of past lives states:The glories of the lord of gods depends on his positive qualities.With positive qualities, your lineage increases.Renown also comes from positive qualities.Even the force of great persons rests in their positive qualities.(23) Skillfully Changing Negative ViewsAs the wandering ascetic Great Awakening, the Bodhisattva became a renunciantand, to benefit the world, traveled to every city, town, village, andcountryside. A king, Qualities of Beings, heard of him and offered him aresidence in a garden. The king served him in the finest fashion and listened tohis teachings. Jealous government officials sowed dissension between the two andthe king’s service diminished. The Bodhisattva left that place for an isolatedretreat where he attained in meditation the five forms of clairvoyance andmiraculous powers. He thought to guide the king and his officials, andmanifested as a person wearing a monkey’s skin. He approached the king and hisofficials, who expressed negative opinions. The Bodhisattva related the faultsof the nature of the wrong views held by each of them, then transformed himselfback to his original appearance. The king, his officials, and the court thusentered spiritual practice.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that it is wrong to forgethelpful deeds and that you must repay them with helpfulness. The twenty-thirdtale of past lives states:Train in ethical behavior and further the renown of generosity;Show the same love to strangers as toward family.Preserve your dominion with justice and renounce carelessness.By doing so, you will gain fame and a higher rebirth.(24) To Return Harm Done with KindnessWhen the Bodhisattva was an ape, a lost man wandered in many directions, andwhen hungry climbed a tree that bore ripe fruit. He ventured on a branchoverhanging a cliff; the branch broke and the man fell down the cliff.This was seen by the ape, who felt intense compassion. He lifted small stones toplace as a stair, then carried the man out of the ravine. Afterward the apesaid, “I’m tired and need to sleep a little. Watch over me until I awake.” Whilehe slept, the man thought, “I’ll kill the monkey, eat him, then be on my way.”He threw a rock at the ape, missed his mark, and the animal awoke. He lookedaround, knew it had been the man, and felt compassion for his folly. He led himto the route and accompanied him to the village. The man’s fault caused him tocontract leprosy and to suffer intensely.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that in the face of harmyou must develop even greater compassion. The twenty-fourth tale of past livesstates:O evil acts, what good are you?In ignorance, without noble intentions,Beings who wish for happinessFall tumbling into misery.(25) To Help Even a KillerWhen the Bodhisattva was the wild animal sharabha [a lionlike animal with eightlegs], a king and his army went to hunt wild animals. The king alone had a fasthorse so he arrived first and saw the beautiful sharabha. He drew his arrow butshot high, alerting the animal, who fled. The king pursued him but when theyarrived at a ravine, the sharabha was able to jump across; the king’s horsehesitated and fell into the ravine. The sharabha soon realized the king had notfollowed and wondered what misfortune had occurred. He returned to the cliff andsaw that his pursuer had fallen. In compassion, he carried the king out of theravine to a safe place, found his horse, and led them to the edge of the forest.The king felt extreme faith and requested the sharabha to visit his kingdom. Theanimal refused but told the king to practice ennobling acts, such as to not killany animal in the kingdom, and to lead his subjects to happiness. Theseteachings made the king enter spiritual life.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that even animals can havecompassion for their killers and that human beings are never right to killliving beings. The twenty-fifth tale of past lives states:Therefore, it is wrong to do to othersWhat you do not wish for yourself.Once you understand that wrongdoing results in suffering,In loss of reputation, and in criticism by holy persons,You will treat such acts as your enemies and forsake them.(26) When Help Is Repaid with Harm, to Not Harm in ReturnAs a golden, spotted deer, the Bodhisattva lived happily in a beautiful forest.One day he saw a man carried away by a torrent and out of compassion pulled himfrom the river. The deer asked the man to not divulge to anyone the kindness hehad done. At that time, the queen of that region’s ruler was a person whosedreams were accurately perceptive. In a dream, she saw all of the spotted deer’spositive qualities and related them to the king. The king asked the people ifthere was any among them who knew of the deer, with the promise of a largereward. The man thought, “The deer was very kind to me, but since I will reap ahandsome reward, I should speak up.” Thus he told the king and led him and hisarmy to the forest, which they surrounded with soldiers. The moment the manshowed the deer to the king, his hand was severed. When the king drew his bow toshoot, the deer saw he had no escape and asked, “King! Who told you I was here?”“It was this man.” “Could it be he I helped who repays me with this harm?” thedeer asked. The king asked the man if this was true; the man replied that itwas. The king aimed his arrow at the man but the deer intervened. The deer gavespiritual teachings and the king was moved to faith. He invited him to thepalace where he gave many teachings. The king, his officials, and subjects alllived according to the doctrine.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that even though your helpis repaid by harm, you must not harm in return. The twenty-sixth tale of pastlives states:Compassionate persons’ deep calm even affects others’ minds.People trust compassionate persons like close relatives.A heart ruled by compassion is never troubled by conflict.A mind steeped in the water of compassion cannot blaze with the fire of turmoil.(27) Using His Body to Make a Path to Protect Others’ LivesAs the king of monkeys, the Bodhisattva called the monkeys to enjoy thedelicious odor and taste of the fruit of a banyan tree. A fruit fell into thewater and was found by the local ruler, who had come to enjoy the forest withhis queen and was bathing in the river. Attached to the fruit’s taste, he wentwith his army to search everywhere in the forest. They found the tree, thensurrounded it. When they saw the monkeys eating the fruit, the king told thesoldiers to kill the monkeys. The noise of arrows and weapons made the monkeyspanic and flee through the treetops. The king of monkeys jumped from the treetopto a hill, tied a bamboo branch to his leg, then leaped back, held a tree branchand allowed the monkeys to flee, saving them all.Two arrows taken from the king’s cotton sheath quiver cut both branches at once.The call went out, “Catch the monkey!” When he was captured, he fainted for amoment. When the monkey revived, the king asked him why he acted as he had. Hereplied, “I’m the king of the monkeys and must lead my subjects to happinesswithout paying attention to my own life.” After he had said this and given manyother teachings, the king reflected, “If an animal king can help his subjectslike that, I must help my own people to live happily.” Thus he acted in accordwith the teachings.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that you must protect yourentourage and people as more precious than your own life. The twenty-seventhtale of past lives states:It is right for a ruler to care like a parent wouldFor armies of the young, farmers, officials,The helpless, his subjects, and brahmins practicing ennobling acts,Helping them all to live in happiness.(28) To Cultivate Karma in Relation to Sublime Persons Reaps Immediate RewardsAs a seer named Patient Speech, the Bodhisattva stayed in retreat on amountainside. The king with his wives came to the forest, visited all thebeautiful sites, then rested. While the king slept, the queens decided to lookat various flowers and birds, and wandered through the forest. Finally they cameupon the seer’s home and listened to his teaching. The king awoke, asked wherethe queens had gone and furiously went looking for them. Finding them in frontof the seer he became enraged and said, “If you’re Patient Speech, can you bepatient at this?” and he cut off the seer’s right arm. Then he cut off his ears,left arm, and legs, but the Bodhisattva remained unperturbed and meditated onpatience. The king left right away and the earth opened up, fire blazed, and heplummeted directly to hell.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that even though you aretormented by another for no reason, you must patiently refrain from anger. Thetwenty-eighth tale of past lives states:Patience is holy persons’ armorThat repels evil persons’ arrows of wicked words,Turning most of them into flowers of praise,Facets of their renown.Patience quells influences harmful to spiritual lifeAnd wins the happiness of perfect freedom.(29) Wrong Views Are Purified by Correct ViewsAs Brahma, the Bodhisattva manifested in the form of a radiant seer of the gods.He appeared before Partial Giving, king of the land Noble Body, who held wrongviews. The king respectfully asked why he had appeared. “Because you must rejectyour wrong views, such as that there are no past or future lives.” The king didnot believe him so he showed him many sufferings, such as those in the hells.The king, afraid, was led to correct views and in turn guided his subjects tothe teachings.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that those with noattachment to their wrong views should definitely train in correct views. Thetwenty-ninth tale of past lives states:A mind settled in evenness overcomes the haughty enemiesOf desire and anger, as if defeating them in battle.(30) Showing the Path to Those in Distress and Giving His BodyWhen the Bodhisattva was an elephant, a king punished one thousand people, thenbanished them to an empty wilderness, where they had no food or drink. Threehundred people perished, leaving seven hundred, for whom the elephant feltcompassion. He showed them the route to a place where there was water and wherethey would find the carcass of a dead elephant. They could eat the animal’sflesh and use its stomach and intestines for water containers. The elephant toldthem that if they continued on the road he showed, they would meet people from acity. He then jumped from a mountaintop into a ravine so the people could eathis dead body, thus ensuring their survival.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that it is necessary to beunconcerned about your own life when helping others. The thirtieth tale of pastlives states:If my act of liberating these individualsWho wandered miserably in the wilderness has any goodness,May I become able to liberate the worldlyWho wander in the wilderness of the round of rebirth.A Set of Four(31) As Prince Moon, he persuaded Sudasa’s son to stop eating human flesh,Thus making everyone secure.(32) As a prince in an iron houseHe became disillusioned with life while at a festival and stayed in retreat.(33) As a water buffalo, when bullied in many ways by a monkey,A noxious spirit asked him questions and he expressed patience. The spiritdeveloped faith.(34) As a woodpecker,He relieved a lion’s pain. The lion forgot his kindness but the bird was praisedby the gods.(31) To Lead Evil Persons to Ennobling ActsWhen the Bodhisattva was Prince Moon, the queens, officials, and subjects wentto a forest to enjoy entertainment with various kinds of song and music. Duringthat time, an eloquent and learned brahmin came to see Prince Moon. The courtand the others became afraid and returned to see Prince Moon, telling him,“Prince, Sudasa’s son, the man-eater Kalmashapada, is coming! What should wedo?” The prince was pleased with the news, but the queens and their retinue allfled. Now that the prince was alone, Sudasa’s son approached and the princecalled him forward. He carried the prince on his back to his home, which wasfilled with his human victims’ flesh and blood.The Bodhisattva thought of the brahmin’s suffering of being left behind aloneand shed tears of compassion. The prince said why he was crying but his captordid not believe him. The prince explained his reasons, then asked, “Let me gofor a while, to take care of the brahmin, then I’ll definitely come back.” Thekidnapper thought to test whether this was falsehood or the truth and let himgo. The prince returned to the palace, listened to four verses from the brahmin,served him, and then returned. The captor was amazed and, on listening to theprince’s teaching, he rejected wrongdoing. He released the prince and those hehad kept in his prison. All were invited to the palace and released to their ownhomelands.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that if even wild, evilpersons meet holy individuals, they can become noble. Therefore, it is necessaryto rely on holy individuals and to listen to their teaching.As a recompense for the brahmin’s four verses of teaching, Prince Moon offeredfour thousand ounces of gold and whatever the brahmin wished, and then spokethese words:If the price of eloquent wordsCould be determined,I would even give my kingdom to meet it.How could you speak of it with regret?When what you hear moves you to faith,Brings perfect joy and stability,Nurtures sublime insight and ends stupidity,Why, it would be right to sell your own flesh for it!Learning is a lamp that dispels the darkness of folly.It is supreme wealth, safe from such dangers as thieves.It is the weapon to defeat the enemy, dullness.It is a supreme friend who provides skillful advice.It is a friend who remains faithful, even when you are poor.It is a harmless medicine to cure the sickness of sorrow.It is the supreme army that crushes a horde of serious faults.It is a supreme treasure of fame and splendor.When meeting good persons, it is the finest gift.In gatherings, it pleases the wise.Toward contentious persons, it is like a blinding sunThat dispels the fame and pride of the opposition.With learning, you become a friend to all and make them truly joyful,Bringing a glow to their eyes and face.They snap their fingers in pleasureAnd praise learning’s special, magnificent qualities.You can lucidly present the meaning of logical proofs,Or teach various subjects, as do the Buddhist scriptures.Attractive in dexterity and thorough training,Learning is like a garland of still-fresh flowers.Learning nurtures discipline and very clear self-confidence.It makes you immediately renowned.Become eloquent, the cause of special qualities.Familiarity with learning’s splendor leads to realization of the clear meaning.Endowed with learning, you will not live in disharmony,And stay firmly on the path of the three pure spheres (of act, agent, andrecipient).After you have studied, devote yourself to spiritual practice,And with little difficulty you will become free from the fortress of rebirth.Further,Truth is more exalted than a beautiful garland necklace.It is exalted, more delicious than any flavor.It accomplishes goodness and positive qualities without the hardships ofasceticismOr the tribulations of unbelievers’ journeys.Truth spreads your fame among all beings.Truth is the path that transcends the three worldsAnd the door that opens to the gods’ realms.It is the bridge that leads from the fortress of the round of rebirth tofreedom.Further,Sit on the lowest seat;Develop the form of splendid discipline.Look with joy in your eyesAnd drink in the words of teaching as if they were nectar.In respect, single-mindedly bow.In perfect faith, with a pure mind,Listen as a sick person heeds a doctor’s words.Develop the attitude of service, and listen to the teaching.(32) Staying in Retreat due to Disillusionment Inspired by a FestivalAs a member of the aristocracy born in an iron house, the Bodhisattva watchedpeople gather for a jasmine flower festival. Reflecting that they were allsubject to impermanence, he became disenchanted. He insistently asked permissionfrom the king to become a renunciant, then stayed in retreat. He accomplishedstates of meditative stability and immeasurable aspirations, and led others tothat path.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that the thought ofimpermanence can make you unattached even to the rule of a kingdom and can makeyou able to practice the teachings. The thirty-second tale of past lives states:We have these powerful, unstoppable enemiesWho will harm us—sickness, aging, and death—And we must inevitably go to the fearful world beyond:How can anyone who knows these facts take pleasure in this?(33) Patience toward HarmWhen the Bodhisattva was a water buffalo, a monkey rode his back and bullied himin many ways, such as beating him with an iron rod. A noxious spirit questionedhim, “You’re very strong. Why don’t you kill the monkey?” When he answered bysaying that you must meditate on patience, the spirit developed faith, and left.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that harmful circumstancesshould be relied upon to foster patience. The thirty-third tale of past livesstates:Toward the weak’s foolishness,The strong should show patience.(34) To Not Be Angry toward Kindness ForgottenAs a woodpecker, the Bodhisattva removed a bone stuck in a lion’s throat andmade him comfortable. Yet the lion forgot this kindness and later scorned him.The god of the forest saw this and asked, “You could hurt the lion with yourbeak, but you haven’t. Why not?” The bird replied, “Whether others are aware ofmy acts or not, it’s not right to harm him.” The god had faith and vanished.The Buddha’s intention in recounting this was to show that you must not becomeangry, even if your kindness is forgotten. The thirty-fourth tale of past livesstates:Toward those in distress,Engage in ennobling acts out of compassion, not for profit.What wise person caresWhether or not others acknowledge the good they have done?Mental Training by Means of the Four Immeasurable Aspirations [C]This section has five parts: (1) immeasurable equanimity, (2) immeasurable love,(3) immeasurable compassion, (4) immeasurable sympathetic joy, and (5)renunciation of worldly love, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.Immeasurable Equanimity [1]This section has two parts: (1) its domain and (2) how to meditate onequanimity.The Domain of Immeasurable Equanimity [a]The domain of equanimity is enemies, friends, and those you regard as neither.The domain of equanimity is harmful enemies, demons, and the like; beneficialpersons, such as your children, spouse, and citizens of your country; and beingswho are neither beneficial nor harmful.How to Meditate on Equanimity [b]While wandering in the round of rebirth without beginning or end,Enemies have been friends and your friendsHave been enemies who caused you incalculable harm.If you treat enemies as friends, they will prove helpful.Help to friends is most often repaid with harm:Rest in equanimity toward others—those toward whom you feel attraction,aversion, or neither.During lifetimes spent wandering in the round of rebirth without beginning orend, your present enemies were once extremely beneficial friends and yourpresent friends were once harmful enemies. Moreover, if you do not considerpresent enemies as such, but treat them helpfully as friends, it is possiblethat they will prove even more helpful than friends.Physical, verbal, and mental effort in aid to friends makes you commit acts thatcreate suffering in this and in future lives, and produce no opportunity for youto be helpful. Therefore, rest in equanimity toward others: give up attachmentto friends and reject hatred toward enemies, as if they were bothindistinguishable from those toward whom you feel neutral. Start with one being,then progressively include sentient beings of the four continents, of thecosmos, and of the entire universe, equal to the limits of space. Regard themall with equanimity. The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Twenty-Five ThousandStanzas states:Subhuti! Settle your mind in equanimity toward all sentient beings, equallytoward one and all!Immeasurable Love [2]This section has two parts: (1) its domain and (2) how to meditate on love.The Domain of Immeasurable Love [a]There is no being who has not been your parent;At that time, they helpfully protected you with incalculable kindness.To return that aid, repay them with helpfulness.Consider that there is not even one among the infinite beings you can see, hear,or think of who has not, from time immemorial, been your father or mother. Whenyour parent, each of them protected you with incalculable kindness. Therefore,do whatever you can to help them, both temporarily and ultimately.How to Meditate on Love [b]Endeavor to lead others to temporary and permanent happinessAnd to the causes of such happiness.Think repeatedly that you will endeavor to lead these beings to positive,ennobling acts consistent with goodness or with liberation. These acts causetemporary happiness within the round of rebirth, and the permanent happiness oftranscendent states. Further, think repeatedly that you will apply yourself onlyto the means for others to be comfortable and happy in body, speech, and mind,both temporarily and permanently. The Perfection of Sublime Insight in EightThousand Stanzas states:Concerted meditation on a loving attitude, and stability within it, make you seeany being as attractive and to feel no anger.The Discourse of Great Liberation states:Compared to someone in a pure, jeweled placeWho guards pure ethical conductFor the period of one eon,One instant of a person’s joyThat leads to loving acts is better.Whoever in this worldly realmCommits wrongdoing in body, speech, and mindWill surely fall to the three miserable realms,Yet such love will immediately purify those acts.Immeasurable Compassion [3]This section has two parts: (1) its domain and (2) how to meditate oncompassion.The Domain of Immeasurable Compassion [a]Any place that space reaches is filled with beings;Beings’ lives are filled with the sufferings of ignorance, karma, and mentalafflictions;Thus they experience the causes and effects of suffering.Any existence within the bounds of infinite space is filled with sentientbeings. Those beings are infected by the sicknesses of ignorance and the eightythousand mental afflictions. Since they always perform with body, speech, andmind such acts as the ten corrupting deeds, they experience continual tormentfrom their acts’ results—the round of rebirth and, in particular, the unbearablesufferings of the three miserable realms.How to Meditate on Compassion [b]Beings, our venerable mothers, are tormentedBy the causes and effects of suffering, and will never become free from theprison of existence.Consideration of their condition induces unbearable compassion.Corrupting acts—the causes of suffering—and their effects—the sufferings of theround of rebirth and miserable realms—ensure that sentient beings, our venerablemothers, have never and will never become free from torment within the frightfulprison pit of existence. Consideration of their condition induces intensecompassion, like that of a mother who sees her child killed. Develop suchimmeasurable compassion. The Discourse That Gathers the True Qualities states:The Honored One said that bodhisattvas should not learn many instructions. TheHonored One said that if bodhisattvas firmly upheld one teaching and realizedit, they would find all teachings of the Buddha in their hands. What is that oneteaching? It is this: supreme compassion. The Honored One said that in supremecompassion, all the Buddha’s teachings are as if placed in the palm of thebodhisattvas’ hands.Immeasurable Sympathetic Joy [4]This section has two parts: (1) its domain and (2) how to meditate onsympathetic joy.The Domain of Immeasurable Sympathetic Joy [a]When seeing beings who act nobly and enjoy happiness,The domain of sympathetic joy is any being who performs a major, middle, orlesser ennobling act or who enjoys the result of ennobling acts, such as longlife, freedom from sickness, perfect power, strength, or increase in fortune.How to Meditate on Sympathetic Joy [b]Feel more joy than if these things were your own:This will increase your joy until it becomes immeasurable.When beings act nobly—the cause of happiness—or experience the result of suchacts—happiness of the higher realms or of liberation—think, “May they always benourished by the sacred happiness of omniscience!” Develop this thought toinclude all sentient beings. The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Twenty-FiveThousand Stanzas states:Whenever you see any sentient beings gain happiness, think this, “May they neverbe separated from this happiness. May they have the happiness of omnisciencethat surpasses the joys of gods and humanity.”Renunciation of Worldly Love, Compassion, Sympathetic Joy, and Equanimity [5]Biased meditation on those to whom you are related, your immediate circleOf relatives and fellow citizens, amounts to worldly love, compassion, joy, andequanimity.Biased meditation on love, and so on, toward beings related to you—such as yourchildren, family, servants, and close fellow citizens—amounts to worldly love,compassion, joy, and equanimity. Meditation on the infinite numbers of allsentient beings makes these four aspirations immeasurable.THE ACTUAL UPLIFTING OF THE MIND TO SUBLIME AWAKENING [III][05_toc-title.html#sec-33]This chapter has four parts: (1) what is to be known, the nature of upliftingthe mind to awakening; (2) the benefits of uplifting the mind to awakening; (3)the stages of the preliminary preparation to uplift the mind to awakening; and(4) the main ritual to uplift the mind to awakening.The Nature of Uplifting the Mind to Awakening [A]The support for uplifting the mind to awakening can be a person who has takenone of the seven kinds of individual liberation vows;Or, it is taught that even such beings as gods, nagas, or noxious spirits can doso.Classification by nature yields two, three, four, five, or six categories.The levels can be illustrated by twenty-two metaphors.First, concerning the life that constitutes the support for uplifting the mindto awakening according to the mind only tradition, a candidate’s physicalsupport is to have received any of the seven kinds of individual liberationvows. Lamp on the Path to Awakening states:Persons continually restrainedBy the seven kinds of individual liberation vows Have the fortune to receive thebodhisattva vows;Others do not have such fortune.According to the middle way tradition, uplift of the mind to awakening can arisein even such beings as gods or nagas, if they are devoted to the great way andwish to attain enlightenment. The Perfection of Sublime Insight in EightThousand Stanzas states:At that time, twenty thousand young gods uplifted their minds to unsurpassableawakening.The Discourse Requested by the Naga King Sagara states:Twenty-two thousand nagas uplifted their minds to awakening.The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:At that time, innumerable gods, nagas, demigods, garudas, semihumans, andmahoragas [earth spirits] uplifted their minds to unsurpassable awakening.The life that constitutes the support for sustaining the vows once they havearisen is life as any of the five kinds of beings. The Fortunate Eon Discoursestates:When the Victor Wishing to Help in a past life was a town leader,He took the vow from the Transcendent One Light of GoodnessTo not kill during one dayAnd for the first time uplifted his mind to unsurpassable awakening.The mental support for sustaining the vows is to have such special, meritoriousattitudes as faith.Second, classification of awakened mind’s nature yields two to six categories.Concerning its two categories, The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse states:There are two categories of awakened mind—Relative and ultimate.Or, Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:In brief, this awakened mindCan be known in two categories:The aspiration to awakenAnd the application to the process of awakening.The three categories of awakened mind are its three forms related to the threetrainings: training that purifies, the ethical conduct of ennobling acts;training that creates tranquility, meditative stability; and training thatliberates, sublime insight.The four categories of awakened mind are as follows: those on the paths ofcultivation and application have that mental uplift expressed as conductmotivated by interest; those on awakening’s first to seventh stages have thatmental uplift expressed as higher pure motivation; those on awakening’s threepure stages have that mental uplift at the level of spiritual maturity; andthose at the stage of enlightenment have that mental uplift expressed asabandonment of obscurations.The five categories of awakened mind are mental uplift on each of the fivepaths.The six categories of awakened mind are those related to the six transcendentperfections. The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Those who have the six forms of mental uplift related to the six transcendentperfections . . .Classification by levels is illustrated by twenty-two metaphors. The Ornament ofManifest Realization states:These are the twenty-two:Earth, gold, the moon, fire,Treasure, a mine, a lake,A vajra, a mountain, medicine, a spiritual guide,A wish-fulfilling jewel, the sun, song,A monarch, a treasury, a highway,A vehicle, a reservoir,An echo, a river, and a cloud.The respective meaning of all the above categories is as follows: To defineaspiration and application, the aspiration aspect of mental uplift is to aspireto apply yourself to others’ welfare, like having the wish to travel; the aspectof application is to undertake such conduct, like the actual travel.To define the three trainings, training in ethical conduct is to restrain yourstream of being from corrupting acts. Training in meditation is to increase suchennobling acts as meditative states. The training in sublime insight is, as youwork for your own and others’ welfare, to discern the nature of phenomena.To define the stages of awakening, at the stage of conduct motivated byinterest, the individual is interested in a conceptual image of the enlightenedheritage. At the stage of higher pure motivation, the individual partially seesthe enlightened heritage. When the individual has such powers as that ofpurifying realms, this marks the stage of spiritual maturity. When sight of thetrue nature of reality is free from all obscurations, this is called mentaluplift in which obscurations have been abandoned.To define the five paths, the path of cultivation, the stage for beginners,consists of emphasis on hearing the doctrine, reflection upon it, and thecultivation of goodness. The path of application consists of application to thepath of seeing’s nonconceptual wisdom. The path of seeing consists of naturalsight of the nature of reality. The path of meditation consists of meditation onwhat has been seen. The path of no further training consists of no meditationonce the training has reached its culmination.To define the meaning of the six transcendent perfections, generosity is theennobling thought to give things to others without greed. Ethical conduct is toprotect the mind from wrongdoing. Patience is to forbear harm. Diligence isenthusiasm toward ennobling acts. Meditative stability is to settlesingle-mindedly on one focus. Sublime insight is to know the nature ofphenomena.The meaning of the metaphors of the levels is stated in A Commentary to “TheOrnament of Manifest Realization”:31 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st31]The uplift of the mind to awakening endowed with the quality [in column one] islike the metaphor [in column two]:image [images/393-00.jpg]image [images/393-01.jpg]The first three relate to the three levels of the path of cultivation. Thefourth, application, relates to the path of application. The next ten, fromgenerosity to wisdom, relate to awakening’s ten stages, respectively. The nextfive, from clairvoyance to confidence, relate to awakening’s three pure stages.The last three relate to the preparation, main part, and conclusion ofawakening’s tenth stage.The uplift of the mind gained through formal promises is present on the path oftraining but not at the stage of enlightenment. At the level of enlightenment,the uplift of the mind is undefiled supreme nondual compassion and its acts forothers’ benefit.The Benefits of Uplifting the Mind to Awakening [B]The benefits of uplifting the mind to awakening are elimination of all fear andsuffering.You become a recipient for the veneration of all beings, including the gods.Your cultivation of ennobling acts becomes endless and ever increasing.That uplift forms the root or seed of spiritual life.It cures the sickness of suffering; it induces the dawn of wisdom.Your qualities increase and you quickly attain supreme enlightenment.The first benefit of uplifting the mind is that it draws you from existence toperfect peace. The Pattern of the Stem states:O child of the enlightened heritage! Awakened mind is like a mighty ship thatcrosses the river of existence.That it is like a guide is stated in The Complete Liberation of MaitreyaDiscourse:Child of the enlightened heritage, it’s like this: when you rely on a warrior,you have no fear of enemies. Likewise, when you rely on a warrior—uplift of themind to the omniscience of bodhisattvas—you have no fear of all your enemies,evil conduct.That it removes entirely all anxiety and wrongdoing is stated in Entering theConduct of Bodhisattvas:If you wish to leave behind the hundreds of sufferings in existence,To relieve sentient beings’ sorrow,And to enjoy myriad of forms of pleasure,Never abandon the awakened mind itself.The Discourse of Pith Instructions states:Those who enter the unsurpassable immaterial domain of awakeningEnd the descending path to the miserable realms and the eight restless states.They discern and fully train in the path to life among gods and humans.Neither blind nor deaf, they will have all senses intact.Further in the same text:Through this, serious wrongdoingWill surely be consumed instantly, as if by the fire at the end of time.The second benefit, that you will become a worthy recipient of gods’ and humans’veneration, is stated in The Pattern of the Stem Discourse:The person who has an uplifted mind becomes a supreme recipient for the world’sveneration, including that of the gods.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Once that mind is truly embraced,From that time forth, even in sleepOr carelessness, the force of its goodnessWill continually, in many ways,Fill the limits of space.The third benefit, that ennobling acts increase, is stated in The DiscourseRequested by Maitreya:Maitreya, it’s like this: for example, all the waters of the great oceans willnot run dry until the eon’s end. Maitreya, likewise, the ennobling acts guidedby the mind uplifted to awakening will not dissipate until the unsurpassableawakening of enlightenment is reached.Further, Maitreya, it’s like this: any seed from an excellent source will growand thrive; likewise, the ennobling acts guided by awakened mind will vastlyincrease.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Other ennobling acts are spent once they bear fruit,Like a plantain tree.The eternal tree of awakened mindIs not exhausted in bearing fruit, but flourishes.The Design of the Basket Discourse states:Manjushri, it’s like this: various kinds of plants and trees grow when nourishedby the four elements. Manjushri, likewise, the source of ennobling acts growswhen guided by awakened mind and when dedicated to omniscience.The fourth benefit, that it is the foundation of spiritual life, is stated inThe Discourse Requested by Brahma:Brahma! This higher motivation, awakened mind, constitutes the foundation ofspiritual life, like a seed. Why is that? From a seed grow shoots, leaves,flowers, and fruit. Likewise, higher motivation creates various experiences ofhappiness within the realms of gods and humans, and will also produceomniscience.The Discourse of Advice to the King states:Your majesty! The complete ripening of the ennobling act of your unsurpassable,genuine, perfect awakened mind will be many births within the gods’ realms andthe experience of happiness there; many births among humans and the experienceof happiness there; and you will rule all gods and human beings. Nevertheless,your majesty, awakened mind’s source of ennobling acts will neither appear todecrease nor increase.The fifth benefit, that it cures the sickness of suffering and generates thelight of wisdom, is stated in Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas:This is the supreme ambrosiaThat conquers beings’ Lord of Death,The inexhaustible treasureThat relieves beings’ poverty.This is the finest medicineThat completely cures beings’ sickness,The sheltering tree of rest for beingsWho wander, spent, throughout existence.This is the common bridge that frees all beingsFrom the miserable realms.This mind is the moon that risesTo relieve the heartache of beings’ mental afflictions.This is the great sun that dissipatesThe mist of beings’ ignorance.The sixth benefit, the supreme one, is stated in The Discourse Showing theTranscendent Buddhas’ Inconceivable Mysteries:If awakened mind’s goodnessHad form,It would fill the realm of spaceAnd still exceed its bounds!The Innumerable Ways of Purification Discourse states:Brahma! Three things constitute limitless goodness and the highest offering andservice to the Transcendent Buddha! What are the three? They are any uplift ofthe mind to genuine, perfect, unsurpassable awakening; to preserve thetranscendent buddhas’ sacred doctrine; and to put the teachings you have heardinto practice. Brahma, these three represent the highest form of offering andservice to the Transcendent Buddha.Nevertheless, Brahma, if the Transcendent Buddha’s life span lasted for one eon,during which he explained the ripening of the goodness of having made materialofferings, he could finish by the eon’s close. However, he could not finish adescription of the mound of goodness of the benefits of awakened mind.A Commentary to Awakened Mind states:Until you uplift your mind to awakening,You will never reach enlightenment.In the round of rebirth there is no other wayTo accomplish your own and others’ benefit.Stages of the Preliminary Preparation to Uplift the Mind to Awakening [C]This section has two parts: (1) preliminary arrangements and (2) offering of theseven-part service.Preliminary Arrangements [1]To prepare, arrange sacred representations and many offerings.“I invite the host of transcendent victors and the victors’ spiritual heirsTo witness the uplift of my mind to sublime awakening:Please be seated on this throne and supreme seat in this fine, beautiful place.”In a clean place, prepare for the ceremony of uplift of your mind to awakeningby arranging sacred representations of wisdom body, speech, and mind and byplacing before them a vast collection of offerings. Further, as mentioned inOpening the Precious Basket: Oral Counsel of the Middle Way, the preliminaryevents comprise three parts: cultivation of goodness and wisdom, purification ofyour stream of being, and special refuge. Goodness and wisdom are cultivatedthrough such activities as recitation of the seven-part service at threejunctures during the day and three junctures during the night; recitation andreading of the profound texts of The Perfection of Sublime Insight, andrecitation of its retention mantra; and presentation of copious offerings to thethree jewels, a celebration of offering and donation to the members of thespiritual community, a festival for children, extensive gifts to the poor, andvast torma offerings for spirits who wander at night.Offering of the Seven-Part Service [2]This section has seven parts: (1) homage, (2) offering, (3) admission ofwrongdoing, (4) rejoicing in others’ ennobling acts, (5) request to turn thewheel of the doctrine, (6) prayer to the buddhas to not transcend suffering, and(7) dedication of ennobling acts to awakening.Homage [a]“With body, speech, and mind multiplied to equal the atoms of all realms,I bow in homage to the spiritual master, and to the victors and their heirs.”The Discourse of Great Liberation states:Join the palms of your hands, like a blossoming lotus bud,At the crown of your head,And with clouds of infinite forms of yourself,Render homage to the buddhas of the ten directions.The benefits of homage are mentioned in The Transmission of the Monastic Code ofConduct:O fully ordained ones! The result of your homage in faith toward religiousmonuments containing the Transcendent Buddha’s hair and nails is that, for aslong as you do not have anger toward those whose pure conduct is akin toBrahma’s, you will experience the happiness of a universal monarch and liveamong gods or humans for as many lifetimes as there are atoms that lie betweenyou and the powerful golden foundation of this world.Offering [b]“To the supreme host of recipients of offerings,I offer both real and imagined offerings—the seven offerings of common use, thepleasures of the five senses,The auspicious signs and substances, the seven precious possessions of amonarch,The three realms, the triple cosmos, and the splendor of realms filling space.”You offer both real and imagined offerings—the seven offerings of common use;the pleasures of the five senses; the eight auspicious signs; the eightauspicious substances; the seven possessions of a monarch (wheel, jewel, queen,official, elephant, supreme horse, and general); the seven semipreciouspossessions (boots, seat, mount, bedding, mansion, sword, and snake-skin); andthe entire wealth and splendor of the environments and beings who fill thelimits of space in the three realms—the desire realm (Mount Meru, the fourcontinents, the subcontinents, the sun, the moon, the encircling iron mountains,and the residences of the desire realm’s gods), the form realm (the seventeenregions), and the formless realm (the four states of composure). These realms,up to the residence of Brahma, are offered, multiplied one thousand times—asimple cosmos; that multiplied one thousand times, a double cosmos; and thatmultiplied one thousand times, a triple cosmos. Entering the Conduct ofBodhisattvas states:I mentally collect all that is not owned by anyoneWithin the bounds of infinite space,And offer it fullyTo Powerful Sage, the supreme individual, and to his spiritual heirs.Admission of Wrongdoing [c]“I admit with regret any evil acts I have accumulatedBy the force of karma and mental afflictions throughout lifetimes withoutbeginning or end.”During the course of a series of lifetimes since time immemorial, the threepoisons’ mental afflictions have led to wrongdoing, such as the ten corruptingacts, acts you committed, and acts committed by others with your encouragementor with your approbation, and so on. These acts become like poison that hasentered your body. Admission of such wrongdoing must be accompanied by fourforces: the force of thorough revulsion, the development of extreme regret; theforce of remedial conduct, the vigorous practice of ennobling acts; the force ofreparation, to take vows and to not repeat corrupting wrongdoing; and the forceof reliance, to exhaust wrongdoing by reliance on the three jewels. TheDiscourse That Presents Subjects in Fours states:Maitreya! If bodhisattvas have four positive qualities, they will overpower thewrongdoing they have done and accumulated. What are these four? The conduct ofthorough revulsion, remedial conduct, the force of reparation, and the force ofreliance.Further, the master explains the shortcomings of wrongdoing; the disciplesrender homage, make offerings, cover the left shoulder with their upper robe,and request, “Please purify my wrongdoing!” Then they take refuge, uplift theirminds, and repeat the following words while focusing their minds on the wordsthey recite:I consider with intense regret any wrongdoing I have done out of desire, anger,or stupidity, in relation to the three jewels, my preceptor, my spiritualmaster, my parents, or any other sentient being. With regret, I admit such actsin the presence of the buddhas and bodhisattvas in the ten directions, in orderto fully adopt the awakened mind and to attain the awakening of enlightenment.From now on, I will keep this vow to not repeat such acts.They repeat these words three times, after which they meditate on emptiness fora moment. Then they imagine that white light radiates from the hearts of thesacred representations of enlightenment, purifying their body, speech, and mind.Afterward, the master asks whether the disciples have received the vows, thedisciples affirm that they have, and the disciples make thanksgiving offerings.Rejoicing in Others’ Ennobling Acts [d]“I wholeheartedly rejoice in the cultivation of ennobling actsAnd the positive karma of every being, ordinary or exalted.”If you sincerely rejoice in others’ ennobling acts, you attain roots ofennobling acts exactly equal to them, as well as measureless goodness. TheConcise Discourse of the Perfection of Sublime Insight states:It is possible to weigh on a scale the countless Supreme Mountains within thecosmos,But the ennobling act of rejoicing in others’ goodness cannot be measured.Request to Turn the Wheel of the Doctrine [e]“For the sake of deluded beings, I request you to forever turn the supreme wheelof the doctrine,Which guides beings according to their needs.”The request to suitable spiritual teachers, such as the spiritual master, toturn the wheel of the doctrine purifies obscurations due to past rejection ofthe teachings and ensures that in all future lifetimes you will always keep thesacred doctrine in your mind and never be separated from it.Prayer to the Buddhas to Not Transcend Sorrow [f]“I request you to not transcend sorrow but to remainUntil the round of rebirth’s seas run dry.”The request to those who guide beings to not transcend suffering but to remainin the world purifies your short life span, untimely death, and the wrongdoingof harming others’ lives; you thereby gain immeasurable longevity.Dedication of Ennobling Acts to Awakening [g]“In order that all beings be liberated, I dedicate to sublime awakeningThis vast ennobling act generated by the twofold cultivation of goodness andwisdom.”The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! Dedicate this source of ennobling acts only to enlightenment. Do notdedicate it to the attainment of the states of hearer, solitary sage, or anyother. Dedicate it for the welfare of all sentient beings. Do not dedicate itfor what you alone can attain, since to do so is to fall into the attitudes ofthe hearers and solitary sages.The Discourse Requested by Bhadra states:With no conceptOf giver, recipient, or giftIn that evenness of generosity,May it be completely perfected in Bhadra.The Main Ritual to Uplift the Mind to Awakening [D]This section has three parts: (1) the difference between aspiration andapplication, (2) how to uplift the mind to awakening, and (3) meditation on joy.The Difference between Aspiration and Application [1]The main ritual concerns the sublime mind of both aspiration and application:Aspiration is the wish to attain the state of enlightenmentFor the benefit of beings;Application is to undertake spiritual practice, the cause of that attainment.Aspiration is the wish to attain the state of enlightenment for the benefit ofall beings; application is to undertake spiritual practice, the cause of theattainment of enlightenment. Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Just as you know the differenceBetween the wish to move and actual movement,The wise should knowThe differences and order in these two.The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:Uplift of the mindIs to wish for true, complete awakening for others’ good.How to Uplift the Mind to Awakening [2]On bended knee, with hands joined in prayer, with intense faith and humility,repeat:“Until I reach the heart of awakening, I take refugeIn the Buddha, the doctrine, and the sublime gathering of the spiritualcommunity.Victors of the ten directions and your spiritual heirs, heed me!Just as the blissful buddhas of the past and their spiritual heirsUplifted their minds to sublime awakening and engaged in its training,I uplift my mind to sublime awakeningAnd will engage in its trainingFor the sake of all beings.“I will liberate listener and solitary sage arhatsWho are not free from cognitive obscurations and states of static peace;I will liberate ordinary individuals and exalted onesWho are not free from the two obscurations;I will give supreme release to those who are bound,Beings assailed by extreme torment in the three miserable existences;And I will place all beings in the transcendent state free of abiding,Beyond life’s wheel of interdependent arising.”Repeat the following three times:From this moment until I reach the heart of awakening, I,_______________________, take refuge in the Honored Buddha, supreme among humanbeings; I take refuge in the sacred doctrine, sublime among states free fromdesire; I take refuge in the supreme gathering, the spiritual community ofexalted, nonreturning bodhisattvas.Then the following lines are repeated three times:Honored buddhas who abide in the ten directions, heed me! Bodhisattvas, greatbeings who rest on awakening’s ten stages, heed me! Spiritual masters, greatholders of the scepter, heed me!Just as honored buddhas of the past and great beings, bodhisattvas, upliftedtheir minds to sublime awakening, from this moment until I reach the heart ofawakening, I, __________________, uplift my mind to sublime awakening. I willliberate all sentient beings who are not yet liberated; free those not yetfreed; give release to those who are still bound; and place in the transcendentstate those who have not fully passed beyond sorrow.The first repetition corresponds to aspiration; the second, to application; andthe third, to the extreme stability of both.Meditation on Joy [3]“Today I have become a child of the victors;A recipient of honor by gods and humans; a supreme guide for beings;And one who has obtained the crowning name bodhisattva:In rapturous joy, I will aid beings.”The goodness of this is such that victors as numerous as the sands of the GangesCould not completely express it during eons as numerous as sands of the Ganges.“In the past, during lifetimes since time immemorial, because I did what was inmy own interest, I circled within the round of rebirth and experienced continualsuffering within existence. From now on, considering others’ good, I enter theranks of bodhisattvas and become a fitting recipient for beings’ homage,including that of the gods. I become a leader to guide beings: this is extremelywonderful.”Joyfully contemplate that you have made your human life meaningful. Entering theConduct of Bodhisattvas states:Thereby, those endowed with such an outlook,Who have adopted the very pure awakened mind, Laud this mind in these wordsTo apply and to increase it:“Now, I have gained my life’s goal:I have fully attained a human lifeAnd today been born within the enlightened heritage,A child of the enlightened ones.“Whatever I do nowWill be in accord with this heritage,That this faultless, noble heritageShould remain flawless.“Like a blind person who findsA jewel in a dustheap,By the same good chance,Awakened mind is born in me.”Complete Grasping of the Root of Ennobling Acts Discourse states:Sharadvatiputra, the aggregation of goodness gained from the initial uplift ofthe mind to awakening is neither poor nor very slight, yet a description of itcould not be completed during one hundred eons, a thousand eons, or even onehundred thousand eons. Therefore, how can the extent of the goodness of thebodhisattvas’ uplift of their minds to awakening be known?The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Stanzas states:Compared to the cultivation of the source of ennobling acts by a person with aspecific goal in mind during eons as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River,another’s uplift of their mind to awakening during one day, a half a day, oreven for as much time as it takes to snap the fingers, has more goodness.The Reunion of Father and Child Discourse states:O fully ordained ones! The mass of positive qualities of the omniscient Buddha’suplift of the mind to awakening cannot be fully described even by transcendentbuddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River speaking during eons asnumerous as the sands of the Ganges River. Why is that? In the past, when theTranscendent Buddha performed the acts of a bodhisattva, he included in hisattitude any sentient being that could be included and never once gave rise toan attitude that was not helpful to any sentient being among them. The realms ofsentient beings are beyond measure. Yet while the Transcendent Buddha performedthe acts of a bodhisattva, he uplifted his mind toward as many realms ofsentient beings as exist and gave rise to the same number of collections ofgoodness. How is that? O fully ordained ones! The realms of sentient beings areendless. Just as the realms of sentient beings are endless, while theTranscendent Buddha performed the acts of a bodhisattva, he uplifted his mindtoward each, and thus gave rise to endless stores of goodness.The Pattern of the Stem Discourse states:Child of the enlightened heritage, it’s like this: a lamp placed within anyhouse or room instantly banishes the darkness accumulated there during a hundredor a thousand years, and the place is illuminated. Likewise, when the lamp ofthe mental uplift to omniscience is placed within the gloomy room of any mind’sdark ignorance, it instantly banishes inexpressible hundreds or thousands ofeons of dark veils of accumulated karma and mental afflictions, and that lampproduces wisdom’s illumination.Child of the enlightened heritage, it’s like this: great naga kings who wear acrown of royal wish-fulfilling gems have no fear of others’ harm. Likewise,bodhisattvas who wear the crown of royal wish-fulfilling gems of awakened mind’ssupreme compassion have no fear of the lower realms or harm from miserableexistences.Child of the enlightened heritage, it’s like this: all the wealth, grain,jewels, gold, silver, flowers, perfumes, garlands, ointments, clothes, andpossessions of beings in worlds reached by the light of the circles of the sunand moon do not equal the value of the sovereign precious jewel. Likewise,during the past, present, and future, in the domain of the basic space ofphenomena illuminated by omniscient wisdom, all sources of ennobling acts,contaminated or uncontaminated, of gods, human beings, hearers, and solitarysages do not equal the supreme sovereign, very precious jewel of the uplift ofthe mind to awakening.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSThe wondrous enlightened heritage, innate constituent of enlightenment, buddhanature: how supremely wonderful!Wondrous great skillful means, uplift of the mind to awakening: how supremelywonderful!Wondrous profound sublime insight, emptiness: how supremely wonderful!Wondrous perfect awakening: how supremely wonderful!The essence of uplift of the mind is the inconceivable altruistic mind alone.The domain of uplift of the mind is the inconceivable realms of beings, ourmothers.The benefits of uplift of the mind are vast, endless, and inconceivable.The result of uplift of the mind is the inconceivable state of enlightenment.What is essential is to include uplift of the mind in any essential ennoblingact.What is essential is to develop exclusively the essential altruistic attitude.What is essential is to work for others’ welfare with essential immeasurablecompassion.What is essential is to assume the essential responsibility to increase help andhappiness for Buddhism and for beings.This concludes a commentary to the words of “The Foundation of the Middle Way,”Book 8 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a workthat elucidates all ways of spiritual development. This has been written byLongchen Choying Tobden Dorje because it is necessary to understand that touplift your mind to supreme, sacred awakening for the benefit of sentient beingsand to grasp every source of ennobling acts with that attitude have benefits asboundless as the number of sentient beings.Fortune!This text has been printed for the benefit of the doctrine and of beings by onewho emphasizes the practice of the root of the great way—compassion and the twoforms of awakened mind—a fully ordained monk of Shakyamuni’s order, areincarnation of the great scholar Shantarakshita, the son of the Victor, theomniscient Tenpé Nyima Pal-zangpo."},{"pageContent":"BOOK 9THE PATH OF THE MIDDLE WAY [05_toc-title.html#head_25]image [images/chapline.jpg]I.

A General Explanation of Bodhisattvas’ Training—the Three Kinds of EthicalConduct2. A Detailed Presentation of the Six Transcendent Perfections3. A Specific Presentation of the Thirty-Seven Facets and Ten Stages ofAwakening on the Four Paths of TrainingThese chapters contain a total of eighty-six headings.BODHISATTVAS’ TRAINING—THE THREE KINDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT [I][05_toc-title.html#sec-34]This chapter has two parts: (1) a concise presentation and (2) the extensiveexplanation of the three kinds of ethical conduct.A Concise Presentation of Bodhisattvas’ Training—the Three Kinds of EthicalConduct [A]After you uplift your mind to sublime awakening as described, you engage in allfacets of the training:Renew your commitment to awakened mind during the six periods of day and night.Employ various means to gradually removeEvery stain that obscures your innate constituent enlightenment, buddha nature.After you uplift your mind to sublime awakening as described, you engage inevery facet of bodhisattvas’ training. To do so, at the six junctures of day andnight, renew the vows of awakened mind and repeat a number of times the prayersof dedication. These and all other techniques to foster the uplift of your mindmerely constitute “causes that separate”—they gradually purify every stain thatobscures your innate constituent enlightenment, buddha nature, and make manifestits self-arisen positive qualities. The Discourse of Ten Qualities states:A precious jewelNaturally provides a source of resplendent light.Once polished,It becomes even twice as bright and beautiful.Likewise, although we are endowed with the enlightened heritage,Effort in the awakened mindPurifies the two extremes,Ensuring that no noxious influences arise in our experiential domain.The Extensive Explanation of Bodhisattvas’ Training—the Three Kinds of EthicalConduct [B]This section has two parts: (1) how to maintain ethical conduct and (2) how torepair violations of ethical conduct.How to Maintain Ethical Conduct [1]This section has two parts: (1) a general presentation of the three kinds ofethical conduct and (2) a detailed explanation of the three kinds of ethicalconduct.A General Presentation of the Three Kinds of Ethical Conduct [a]The three kinds of ethical conduct are restraint from faulty conduct,Gathering ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.Renounce the seven things that undermine these forms of ethical conduct; rely onthe three things that preserve its integrityAnd the nine things that enhance it. The classification and standard enumerationare as three.Bodhisattvas’ ethical conduct takes three forms: restraint from faulty conduct,the gathering of ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.Seven things undermine these forms of ethical conduct. Of these, three impedesublime insight: disinterest in hearing the teachings, forgetfulness inreflection, and apathy in meditation. Avoid them. Four are faults in altruisticacts: extreme laziness in application, conduct that causes others to lose faith,lack of compassionate motivation, and counterproductive conduct.Three things preserve the integrity of the bodhisattvas’ training. First, threerecollections preserve its integrity during this life: recollection of thebenefits of uplifting the mind, the disadvantages of having that upliftdeteriorate, and the difficulty of attaining such mental uplift. Bring theserepeatedly to mind.Second, three things ensure the integrity of the bodhisattvas’ training duringfuture lives so it becomes irreversible: performance of the seven-part servicethree times a day, supplications to the victors and their spiritual heirs, andrenunciation of negative acts contrary to spiritual life.Third, five things to cherish sustain the integrity of the bodhisattvas’training both now and later: to cherish the domain of spiritual practice,sentient beings, more than yourself; to cherish what is to be practiced, thedoctrine, more than wealth; to cherish the main point, awakened mind, more thanyour heart; to cherish the principal contributing factor to this path, yourspiritual guide, more than your parents; and to cherish what is to be attained,enlightenment, more than possessions.Among nine things that enhance awakened mind, five recollections involveremembering the following: the instability of composite phenomena, theinevitability of suffering, the benefits of spiritual life, the outstandingpositive qualities of the teacher who reveals the meaning, and the benefits ofthe awakened mind. Four acts complete the nine: looking with eyes ofmindfulness, movement by the supreme horse of diligence, encouragement by theriding crop of disengagement, and a mind turned toward the city of freedom.The classification includes three kinds of ethical conduct. The Pinnacle ofJewels Discourse states:Kashyapa! Bodhisattvas’ ethical conduct has three facets: the ethical conduct ofrestraint, the gathering of ennobling qualities, and the gathering of altruisticacts.These three are essentially one thing differentiated according to its differentaspects, like a single gem that can dispel darkness, gather various forms ofwealth, and help stop epidemics.Ethical conduct’s standard enumeration is as three. Bodhisattvas’ actsdefinitely help both the doer and others: altruistic acts bring others’ streamsof being to spiritual maturity; restraint from negative acts and the gatheringof positive qualities bring your own stream of being to spiritual maturity.Therefore, the standard enumeration is as three.A Detailed Explanation of the Three Kinds of Ethical Conduct [b]This section has three parts: (1) the two traditions of the ethical conduct ofrestraint from faulty conduct, (2) the ethical conduct of gathering ennoblingqualities, and (3) the ethical conduct of altruistic acts.The Two Traditions of the Ethical Conduct of Restraint from Faulty Conduct [i]This section has two parts: (1) Nagarjuna’s tradition of the ethical conduct ofrestraint from faulty conduct and (2) Asanga’s tradition—training in aspirationand application.Nagarjuna’s Tradition of the Ethical Conduct of Restraint from Faulty Conduct[A)]Two traditions present the vows of restraint from faulty conduct.The tradition of Nagarjuna follows The Discourse of the Bodhisattva Sky Essenceand The Discourse of Skillful Means,And is delineated in The Compendium of Training.Twenty fundamental downfalls and eighty reprehensible acts are as follows:Five definitely apply to rulers—to confiscate offerings to the three jewels, torenounce Buddhism,To punish ennobling practice, to commit any act of immediate fruition, and tohold wrong views.Five definitely apply to government officials—to destroy villages, provinces,Cities, towns, or surrounding areas.Eight definitely apply to ordinary persons—to speak of emptiness to those whoare mentally unprepared;To lead someone to the lesser way; to induce abandonment of the lesser way andadherence to the great way;To claim that the lesser way does not prevent mental afflictions in encouraginganother to adhere to your own beliefs;To criticize others and to praise yourself, driven by jealousy; to lie, for gainor glory;To cause a fully ordained individual to be punished and to accept a bribe;To disrupt a renunciant’s mental tranquility by confiscating their possessionsto give to a reciter of texts.The last two are to relinquish the aspiration to awaken or the application toawakening. Thus, there are twenty in all.Of the reprehensible acts, twenty-four concern disregard of happiness andsuffering;Sixteen, disregard of spiritual practice—A total of forty. These, differentiated by temporaryOr permanent disregard, give a total of eighty.Nagarjuna’s tradition of the bodhisattva vows is modeled on The Discourse of theBodhisattva Sky Essence and The Discourse of Skillful Means, and is delineatedby Shantideva in The Compendium of Training.According to these sources, there are twenty fundamental downfalls and eightyreprehensible acts. Five definite fundamental downfalls apply to rulers: toconfiscate the wealth of the religious community, such as articles dedicated tothe Buddha, doctrine, or spiritual community; to renounce the scripturaldoctrine’s three collections of texts or the doctrine of realization’s threetrainings; to punish an ordained person with imprisonment, whether or not theymaintain correct ethical conduct; to commit one of the five acts of immediatefruition—to kill your father, mother, or an arhat, to create dissension withinthe spiritual community, or with malicious intent to cause the Buddha to bleed;and to hold wrong views, such as the denial of the relation among acts, karma,and consequence. The Compendium of Training states:To steal offerings given to the three jewelsIs considered to be a defeating downfall.To renounce the sacred doctrineWas declared by the Sage to be the second.Further downfalls are, even if a fully ordained person has failed in ethicalconduct,To confiscate their saffron robes, to beat them,To put them in jail,Or to cause them to give up renunciant life;To commit one of the acts of immediate fruition;And to hold wrong views.Five definite downfalls apply to government officials: In anger, to destroy byfire or other means villages—a settlement that consists of one clan or more;provinces—an area where persons of the four castes live; cities—an area wherethe eighteen kinds of artisans live; towns—where many merchants gather; andsurrounding areas—large areas, such as Champaka. The previous text states:The Victor declared that such acts as destroying villagesConstitute downfalls.Eight definite downfalls apply to ordinary persons: to teach emptiness to thosewho are mentally unprepared, making them apprehensive; to induce a person whohas entered the great way to change course and to adhere to the lesser way; tocause another to abandon the individual liberation vows—the lesser way—to adhereto the great way; to maintain that the lesser way does not overcome mentalafflictions and to encourage others in that belief; to criticize another and topraise yourself, driven by jealousy toward another bodhisattva; in order toreceive gain and honor, to commit the highest form of lying, such as to claim,“I have direct realization of the profound instructions of emptiness!” althoughyou do not have such realization; to create through slander a breach between aperson in power, such as a king, and a practitioner of these teachings, then tocause the powerful person to punish the fully ordained individual with a fine.If the practitioner then misappropriates offerings to the three jewels to giveas a bribe to the slanderer, the fault is incurred when the slanderer acceptsthe bribe, whether they keep it themselves or give it to the powerful person.The last is to confiscate the possessions of a renunciant meditator and to givethem to a reciter of texts or to induce another to give up contemplativepractice, such as tranquility. The previous text states:The downfalls are to speak of emptinessTo a sentient being who has no previous mental training;To cause someone who has entered the path to enlightenmentTo turn away from perfect awakening;To cause someone to completely forsake individual liberationTo enter the great way;To believe that the paths of training do not resultIn the abandonment of attachment and other mental afflictionsAnd to induce another to accept this view;To speak of your positive qualitiesFor gain or honor,Or to criticize another in verse;To claim that you have gained forbearance in relation to profound emptiness,Which is the most misleading statement;To cause a noble practitioner to be punished,Causing the misuse of offeringsGiven to the three jewels;To induce another to give up mental tranquility,Or to transfer possessions of those who settle in evenness correctlyTo someone who recites texts.These are the fundamental downfallsThat cause sentient beings to be reborn in the great hells.In addition to these eighteen fundamental downfalls, relinquishment of theaspiration to awaken is the nineteenth and, according to The Pinnacle of JewelsDiscourse, relinquishment of the application to awakening, such as to not applyyourself to ennobling acts, constitutes the twentieth.Further, three levels of training correspond to degrees of bodhisattvas’spiritual acumen—highest, middle, and average. For the highest, eighteendownfalls are presented in The Discourse of the Bodhisattva Sky Essence and TheCompendium of Training. For those of a middle degree of spiritual acumen, thereare four downfalls, taught in The Compendium of Training, the text thatelucidates the meaning of The Discourse of Skillful Means. It states:The four downfalls are to completely relinquish the awakened mind;In endless attachment and greed,To not give to a beggar;To have no patience toward sentient beingsBut to strike them in anger,Even though they earnestly try to please you;To teach as Buddhist doctrine teachings you have concoctedFrom what is in harmony with the mental afflictions.Those of the lowest degree of spiritual acumen must not relinquish theaspiration to awaken. The Discourse of Advice to the King states:Your majesty! You are very busy and have much to do: you are unable to train inevery aspect of the transcendent perfections, from generosity to sublimeinsight. Therefore, your majesty, continually and mindfully recall your intenttoward, faith in, and aspiration to strive for authentic, complete awakening.This can be done whether you walk, sit, lie down, wake up, eat, or drink. Alwaysrecall this, keep it in mind, and meditate on it. Rejoice in the ennobling actsdone by others. Having rejoiced, make offerings to all buddhas, bodhisattvas,hearers, and solitary sages. Together with all sentient beings, presentofferings to them. Then, until all sentient beings completely perfect thepositive qualities of enlightenment, dedicate such acts each day tounsurpassable awakening.Your majesty! You can thus rule your kingdom, your duties as ruler will not benegatively affected, and your cultivation of awakening will become complete.Moreover, The Concise Discourse of the Perfection of Sublime Insight states:However, if bodhisattvas engage in the path of the ten ennobling acts during amillion eonsWith the wish to become a solitary sage arhat,Their ethical conduct is flawed, and correct conduct thereby violated.That intention is far more serious than a defeating act for a monk.Eighty supplementary errors are as follows: twenty-four concern disregard ofhappiness and suffering; sixteen, disregard of spiritual practice—a total offorty; when each is applied to two circumstances, this gives the total ofeighty.First, the twenty-four forms of disregard of happiness and suffering are asfollows. The basis is twofold—to not alleviate others’ suffering or mentaldistress, even though you are able; and to not foster others’ comfort and mentalhappiness even though you are able. These two, applied to either a physical ormental basis for the suffering or happiness, produce four. Those four, appliedto the present or future, produce eight. Those eight, applied to threesubsequent considerations—lack of diligence in body, speech, or mind in relationto that being; to not search for helpful causes or conditions; or to not applyyourself to corrective antidotes—produce twenty-four.Second, the sixteen forms of disregard toward spiritual practice are as follows:The basis is twofold—to be unwilling to do something minor to alleviateanother’s severe suffering or mental distress. These two, applied to present orfuture lifetimes, produce four; and applied to your own or other’s minds,produce four. Further, the second basis is to be unwilling to do something minorto prevent the deterioration of others’ significant comfort or mental happiness.As in the former case, when this is applied to present or future lifetimes andto your own or another’s mind, it produces the total of eight.Each of these forty can be differentiated by temporary disregard or lastingdisregard, to produce the total of eighty.Asanga’s Tradition—Training in Aspiration and Application [B)]Training in aspiration includes to not mentally abandon any being, to recall thebenefits of awakened mind,To cultivate stores of goodness and wisdom, and to be diligent in training inawakened mind.Renounce these four negative acts: to deceive those worthy of veneration, toprovoke regret,To criticize holy persons, and to deceive anyone.Practice their opposite, the four positive acts.The training in application includes renunciation of four fundamental downfalls:To criticize another and to praise yourself for gain or honor;To not give objects or spiritual instruction out of greed;To remain angry and abusive even though another has acknowledged a mistake;To present a false impression of yourself as a spiritual person after havingrenounced the great way.There are thirty-four and twelve reprehensible acts—forty-six in all.In Asanga’s tradition, the principal training consists of techniques to notmentally relinquish sentient beings: never mentally abandon a sentient being.The thought based in annoyance toward any sentient being, “When an opportunityoccurs to help you, I will not help you; when an opportunity occurs to preventharm befalling you, I will not prevent it,” constitutes mental abandonment ofthat sentient being. Instead, when your help to someone is repaid with harm, toagain reply with compassion is to not mentally abandon a sentient being.To always recall the benefits of awakened mind, you should carefully examine andrecall the two hundred and thirty metaphors taught in The Pattern of the Stemand reflect on the teachings given above. To integrate the cultivation of thetwofold store of goodness and wisdom, accompany meritorious acts (such asgenerosity) with the cultivation of wisdom—lack of conceptualization in relationto the three spheres (of act, agent, and recipient). This twofold cultivationnourishes the awakened mind.The technique to increase the awakened mind is diligence in repeatedly trainingin it. Train your stream of being by meditating on love and compassion. Train inthe actual awakened mind by uplifting your mind to awakening at the sixjunctures of the day and night. Train in “taking and sending” by dedicating yourhappiness and ennobling acts to sentient beings and by taking on theirwrongdoing and suffering.Four negative acts must be renounced, such as to use lies to deceive thespiritual master, preceptor, or teacher. The Discourse Requested by Kashyapa, achapter of The Pinnacle of Jewels Discourse, states:Kashyapa! Four acts make you forget the awakened mind. What are they? To deceivea spiritual master or a venerable person, to make someone regret an act thatneed not be regretted, to speak in anger of the faults of a bodhisattva who hasuplifted their mind to awakening, and to deceive or cheat a sentient being.Their opposites, the four positive acts, must be practiced. The same textstates:Kashyapa! Four acts ensure that you will not forget the awakened mind. What arethey? To never knowingly tell a lie, to develop the perception of bodhisattvasas the Teacher, to remain steadfast in higher motivation without deceivingsentient beings, and to correctly lead all sentient beings to the great way.Training in application to awakening includes to not commit the four fundamentaldownfalls, distinguished by their respective motivations of attachment, greed,anger, and stupidity: tightly bound by acute attachment for gain (such asofferings) or for honor (such as a specified seat), to praise yourself in orderto receive that gain or honor or to criticize others who already enjoy such gainand honor. When any other person has understood your words, this first downfall,which for a bodhisattva is similar to a defeating act for a monk or nun, hasbeen incurred.Out of greed, to not give material wealth or spiritual instruction to those whoare suffering, poor, or destitute incurs the second downfall. In anger, to notbe satisfied with the belligerent words you say, but to inflict harm withbeating or physical abuse incurs the third downfall. Tightly bound by stupidity,to voice such criticisms as, “The collection of bodhisattva teachings are notthe Buddha’s doctrine!” and to give up that collection of teachings incurs thefourth downfall. This can also be incurred if you delight in your own or others’unwholesome acts and present them falsely as the sacred doctrine. The TwentyCommitments states:In attachment to gain and honor,To praise yourself and to criticize others; In greed, to not give materialwealth or spiritual instructionTo those who are suffering or destitute;To not accept another’s apology,But to strike in anger;To present false teachings as sacredAlthough you have abandoned the great way.Atisha considered that each of these four can be further divided into two,giving a total of eight.The forty-six reprehensible acts are divided into two categories—thirty-fourthat contradict gathering ennobling qualities and twelve that contradictaltruistic acts. The first has six categories:Seven acts contradict generosity. The Twenty Commitments states:To not offer the three (that is, your body, speech, and mind) to the threejewels,To indulge your mind’s desires,To not respect your elders,To not reply to questions,To refuse invitations,To not accept gifts, such as gold,To not give spiritual instruction to those who seek it.Nine acts contradict ethical conduct. The same text states:To reject those who have violated the lesser way’s ethical conduct,To not train in order to inspire others,To do little to help sentient beings,To not commit a corrupting act out of compassion even though this is permitted,To undertake wrong livelihood,To act carelessly, such as being very wild,To consider crossing over the round of rebirth alone,To not give up unrespectable acts,To not practice the doctrine even though you still have mental afflictions.Four acts contradict patience. The same text states:To return criticism with criticism, and so on,To reject angry persons,To not accept another’s honest apology,To indulge in your mind’s anger.Three acts contradict diligence. The same text states:To gather a circle of persons around yourself, with the wish for gain or honor,To not overcome laziness, and so on,To continue meaningless conversations due to attachment.Three acts contradict meditative stability. The same text states:To not strive for the goal of meditative states,To not renounce whatever obscures meditative stability,To regard the flavor of meditative stability as a positive quality.Eight acts contradict sublime insight. The same text states:To reject the hearers’ way,To be diligent in their way although you have your own (bodhisattva) path,Without diligence in the great way, to apply yourself to non-Buddhist writings,To be diligent in and to enjoy non-Buddhist writings,To reject the great way,To praise yourself and to disparage others,To not go to listen to the doctrine,To criticize the teacher and to adhere to just the words, rather than themeaning.Second, the twelve reprehensible acts that contradict altruism have threecategories. Four faults that violate serving others are listed in the same text:To not go as a needed companion,To abandon taking care of the sick,To not relieve suffering,To not teach the careless what is correct.Six faults of not helping others are listed in the same text:To not repay kindness shown,To not relieve others’ anguish,To not give to those who seek material wealth,To not serve your entourage,To not conform to others’ attitudes,To not praise others’ positive qualities.Two faults of not correcting what is negative are listed in the same text:To not correct what is negative in suitable circumstancesAnd to not intimidate, and so on, with miraculous powers.The commentary states:However, when faults are committed through disrespect, apathy, or laziness, theyare committed under the mental afflictions’ influence. However, if they arecommitted through forgetfulness, they are not committed under the mentalafflictions’ influence. If a person has done such acts while mentally deranged,no fault is incurred.If those who have the spiritual support of having taken renunciant vows committhese acts, the four defeating acts of the monastic vows correspond in thiscontext to the fundamental downfalls. Other faults and downfalls, apart fromthose listed here, constitute supplementary violations within the bodhisattvatraining.The Ethical Conduct of Gathering Ennobling Qualities [ii]The ethical conduct of gathering ennobling qualities includes the sixtranscendent perfections,Their characteristics, literal meaning, classification, enumeration,Order, ways of practice, and benefits.This section has eight parts: the six transcendent perfections; and theircharacteristics, literal meaning, classification, standard enumeration, order,ways of practice, and benefits.First, the six transcendent perfections are generosity, ethical conduct,patience, diligence, meditative stability, and sublime insight.Second, these six can be defined as follows: The ethical conduct of gatheringennobling qualities is any training in the spiritual practice of bodhisattvas,done with the intention (and related factors) to accomplish any ennobling act,synthesized as the six transcendent perfections that have four uniquecharacteristics. These four are the following: the six transcendent perfectionsare free from what is inconsistent with each; they are guided by nonconceptualsublime insight in relation to the three spheres (of agent, act, and recipient);they have the function of fulfilling others’ wishes; and having done that, theyteach the doctrine that brings disciples, according to their karmic connections,to spiritual maturity within the three states of awakening.What is inconsistent with each transcendent perfection is stated in sequence inThe Ornament of the Discourses:Greed, lapses in ethical conduct, anger,Laziness, distraction, and lapses in sublime insight.The functions are listed in the same text:Gifts, such as of material objects, maintaining a lucid mind,Patience toward others’ harm, diligence in aid and friendliness,Miraculous powers, and discernment in what to accept or reject:These completely fulfill others’ wishes.Third, the literal meaning of the term paramita in Sanskrit is as follows: parameans “other side”; mita means “to have gone.” “Transcendent perfection” is togo to the superb far shore beyond the ennobling qualities of worldly persons,hearers, or solitary sages.Fourth, the classification is as follows: there are six transcendentperfections, such as generosity, as stated by the great omniscient master,Longchenpa:The spiritual training of the victors’ spiritual heirsConsists mainly of training in the six transcendent perfections.Each of the six transcendent perfections, such as generosity, can be furtherclassified into six. For example, when each transcendent perfection isaccompanied by generosity, this produces the generosity of each, such as thegenerosity of generosity. Likewise, when the conduct of each is performedwithout inconsistencies, this produces the ethical conduct of each. When each isundertaken with tolerance of hardship, this is the patience of each. When eachis undertaken accompanied with joyful enthusiasm, this is its diligence. Whenthis diligence guides an undistracted mind, this is its meditative stability.When the six transcendent perfections are guided by nonconceptual sublimeinsight in relation to the three spheres of agent, act, and recipient, thisproduces the sublime insight of each. Thus there are thirty-six aspects in all.Fifth, the standard enumeration of the transcendent perfections is as follows:All spiritual practice of bodhisattvas can be gathered into the three trainings(in higher ethical conduct, meditative states, and sublime insight). From thisperspective, the transcendent perfections’ enumeration as six is as follows.Superb ethical conduct arises from generosity’s freedom from attachment topossessions. In turn, ethical conduct accompanied by the four guidelines ofennobling training produces patience.32 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st32] Thesethree, by virtue of their cause, essence, and unique features, are subsumedunder the category of training in higher ethical conduct. Meditative stabilityis subsumed under training in higher meditative states; sublime insight, undertraining in higher sublime insight. Diligence is their common companion. TheOrnament of the Discourses states:The Victor correctly taughtThe six transcendent perfectionsIn relation to the three trainings:The first three; the last two in two categories;And one that belongs to all three categories.Sixth, the order of the transcendent perfections has been determined accordingto cause and effect—the former produce the latter; and the latter arecomparatively higher and more subtle than the former.Seventh, how the transcendent perfections become part of spiritual practice isas follows. Generosity is given without expectation of reward or positivefruition. Ethical conduct is honored without a wish for a pleasant rebirth inhappy existences. Patience is meditated upon without the thought of any sentientbeing as an adversary. Diligence is undertaken in natural delight toward thegathering of all your own and others’ ennobling qualities. Meditative stabilityis settling in evenness within meditative stability that rids you ofself-absorbed states which characterize the divine realms of meditativestability and formlessness. Sublime insight is practiced without separation fromthe skillful means of supreme compassion.The experience of all six transcendent perfections must be cultivatedaccompanied by six sacred aspects: their sacred support—the presence of awakenedmind; their sacred substance—impartial, all-inclusive generosity, and the rest;their sacred purposeful activity—application to that which aids sentient beings;their sacred skillful means—acts guided by nonconceptual sublime insight inrelation to the three spheres (of agent, act, and recipient); their sacreddedication—to unsurpassable awakening; and their sacred purity—conduct thateffectively counteracts the two obscurations.Eighth, the benefits of the transcendent perfections have two parts: thepositive qualities of each of the six transcendent perfections and the resultsof their experiential cultivation. First, the positive qualities of the sixtranscendent perfections have four facets: they are vast, since their commonunderlying intention is the attainment of complete awakening in order to serveothers; nonmaterial, since each is free from inconsistencies, such asexpectation of reward or positive fruition; very meaningful, since they placeall beings in a state of spiritual uplift or certain fortune (that is, the threestates of awakening); and inexhaustible, since they continually increase as eachis guided by the skillful means of the union of emptiness and compassion, and bydedication of goodness of positive acts. The same text (The Ornament of theDiscourses) states:Know the four positive qualitiesOf all the transcendent perfections, including generosity, to be these:They are vast, nonmaterial,Very meaningful, and inexhaustible.Second, the transcendent perfections’ results has two parts: first, theirtemporary results are as stated in The Garland of Jewels:Through generosity, wealth is gained; through ethical conduct, happiness;Patience, splendor; diligence, brilliance;Meditative stability, peace; and the outlook of sublime insight, liberation.Second, their ultimate result is that, gathered within the context of the sixperfections, the cultivation of goodness becomes the cause of the wisdom bodiesthat have form; and the cultivation of wisdom, the cause of the body of ultimateenlightenment. The Ornament of the Discourses states:Generosity and ethical conductConstitute the cultivation of goodness; sublime insight, that of wisdom.Three belong to both goodness and wisdom.If done with sublime insight, all five become the cultivation of wisdom.The Ethical Conduct of Altruistic Acts [iii]This section has two parts: (1) the actual ethical conduct of altruistic actsand (2) training and conduct related to all three kinds of ethical conduct.The Actual Ethical Conduct of Altruistic Acts [A)]The ethical conduct of altruistic acts is the four means to gather disciples—To summon disciples by means of the signal of generosity;To draw their attention by pleasant speech;To have them practice, according to their interests, the meaning of ways ofspiritual development;And to conform to that meaning, thus putting them at ease.The presentation of the ethical conduct of altruistic acts has four parts: itsdefinition, classification, standard enumeration, and how altruistic acts can besummarized.First, the definition of altruistic acts is as follows. The ethical conduct ofaltruistic acts is any training in the spiritual practice of bodhisattvas, donewith the attitude (and related factors) of wishing to devote yourself to theskillful service of others, to bring sentient beings to full spiritual maturity.Second, the classification is fourfold: generosity, pleasant speech, meaningfulconduct, and conformity with beings’ needs. First, to attract to your circlethose disciples not yet gathered around you, begin by pleasing them withmaterial gifts. The Lotus Mound states:Send well the signal of generosity.Second, once disciples have gathered, lead them with conversation in pleasantspeech according to their respective degree of acumen. By teaching the sacreddoctrine, have them develop strong inclination and enthusiasm to undertake itsspiritual practice. The same text states:Greet them with pleasantly spoken words.Third, just as we nourish infants with food of gradually increasing solidity, asingle teaching will not permit persons of differing degrees of acumen tomature. Therefore, have disciples engage in Buddhist practice suitable to theirrespective level. Be skillful in means to aid and bring happiness to sentientbeings, leading them directly or indirectly through the stages of the lesser,middle, and great ways of spiritual development. The same text states:Be determined to act for their welfare.Fourth, to lead those sentient beings within the sacred doctrine and ennoblingconduct, you must train yourself to conform to them as well. If you have notdone this, disciples will not wish to heed you, just as they would not beinclined to listen to a leper who teaches the meditation practice of Garuda,said to cure leprosy. The same text states:By conforming to the teachings, put them at ease.Third, the standard enumeration of altruistic acts is as four. The first,material generosity, helps disciples temporarily, whereas the last three createthe causes of disciples’ ultimate welfare—to have them grasp the teachings,comprehend their meaning, and continually follow them.Fourth, altruistic acts can be summarized as follows: all altruistic acts areguided by the uplift of the mind that directly or indirectly aids and createshappiness for sentient beings. In brief, altruistic acts can be synthesized asfour as above, or as two: to attract into your circle those who have not yetgathered around you, and to lead those gathered to spiritual maturity.Another source summarizes the ways to serve others as twelve. The Bodhisattvas’Stages of Awakening states:To befriend those who are engaged in meaningful acts; to relieve the sufferingof sentient beings in misery; to teach skills to those who do not know how to dosomething; to be sensitive to kindness you’ve been shown and to repay it; toprotect others from danger; to relieve the anguish of those who suffer; to givegifts to those without material fortune; to attract perfectly a circle offollowers through spiritual teachings; to conform to others’ expectations; toinspire joy by your true positive qualities; to fully eradicate evil; to usemagic to instill fear and to inspire inclination.Training and Conduct Related to All Three Kinds of Ethical Conduct [B)]During the four forms of activity—walking, sitting, eating, and sleeping—Be circumspect, exercising vigilance and mindfulness,As described in the collection of The Discourse of Perfectly Pure Conduct.Recite with pure motivation prayers of aspiration that relate to yourcircumstances.When walking, place your eyes’ sight at the length of one yoke’s breadth infront of you. When meeting others, smile brightly and greet them with,“Welcome!” Make others happy with pleasant speech.Sitting, take a straight-backed, cross-legged posture and undertake any of theten forms of spiritual conduct, such as teaching, listening, or meditation.When eating, rid yourself of craving and attachment and offer the first portionof your food and tormas accompanied by recitation of Remembering the ThreeJewels Discourse. With the intention to nourish your body and to help its innerparasites, eat as much as is helpful for your well-being and meditation, anddedicate the leftover food to other beings.At night, when going to bed, sleep on your right side (for males), your headpointing north; remember death and imagine the three jewels to be present atyour pillow. With the perception that ennobling acts will arise and appear, fallasleep with the mind at rest within the nature of reality.On waking the next morning, rise remembering the three jewels and the awakenedmind. Spend your time in ennobling practice that will help others and yourself.Always keep three things in mind: vigilant recollection in guarding your mind;mindful attention toward whether or not faults have arisen in your stream ofbeing; and careful, rigorous attention in relation to what must be engaged in orwhat must be turned away from.In particular, as stated in The Flower Ornament Discourse of Perfectly PureConduct,When bodhisattvas enter a building, they uplift their mind with the thought,“May all sentient beings reach the city of liberation!”Likewise, when sleeping, “May they attain the Buddha’s ultimate body ofenlightenment!”When dreaming, “May they realize all phenomena as a dream!”When waking, “May they awake from ignorance!”When rising, “May they attain enlightenment’s form bodies!”When dressing, “May they be clothed in modesty and carefulness!”When fastening a belt, “May they be connected to the sources of ennobling acts!”When sitting on a seat, “May they reach the Vajra Seat!”When leaning back, “May they find the tree of awakening!”When making a fire, “May they burn the kindling of their mental afflictions!”When the fire takes light, “May the fire of their wisdom blaze!”When the food is cooked, “May they come to gain wisdom nectar!”When eating, “May they obtain the food of meditative stability!”When going out, “May they become free from the city of the round of rebirth!”When walking down stairs, “May I enter the round of rebirth to serve sentientbeings!”When opening a door, “May the gate to the city of freedom be opened!”When closing a door, “May the gate to the lower realms be closed!”When entering a path, “May they enter the path of exalted beings!”When climbing, “May I place all sentient beings in the happiness of the higherrealms!”When descending, “May the continuity of the three miserable existences beended!”When meeting a sentient being, “I am meeting the Buddha!”With each step, “I am walking to serve all sentient beings!”With each raising of the foot, “May they rise from the round of rebirth!”On seeing a person wearing jewelry, “May they attain the marks and signs ofenlightenment’s physical perfection!”On seeing a person without jewelry, “May they attain the positive qualities ofspiritual training!”On seeing a full vessel, “May they be full of positive qualities!”On seeing an empty vessel, “May they be empty of faults!”On seeing a joyful sentient being, “May they be joyful in spiritual life!”On seeing a sad being, “May they be unhappy with composite phenomena.”On seeing a happy sentient being, “May they attain the happiness ofenlightenment!”On seeing suffering, “May the sufferings of sentient beings be pacified!”On seeing sickness, “May they be liberated from sickness!”On seeing kindness done, “May they return the kindness of all buddhas andbodhisattvas!”On seeing kindness not reciprocated, “May they not return the ‘kindness’ ofwrong views!”On seeing an argument, “May they be able to eradicate all attacks from wrongviews!”On seeing praise, “May they praise all buddhas and bodhisattvas!”On seeing conversations concerning Buddhism, “May they attain theself-confidence of the Buddha!”On seeing sacred images, “May they have no obscuration in their sight of allbuddhas!”On seeing a religious monument (literally, “a support for offerings”), “May allbeings become supports for offerings!”On seeing commerce, “May they gain the seven treasures of the exalted!”On seeing prostrations done, “May all worldly beings, including the gods, attainthe invisible crown of enlightenment!”With such thoughts, uplift your mind.How to Repair Violations of Ethical Conduct [2]This section has three parts: (1) the presentation of the downfalls—the fourparameters; (2) how to engage in training conscious of the permissions andprohibitions; and (3) the explanation of effective restoration of the training.The Downfalls—the Four Parameters [a]The four parameters are actual downfalls, apparent downfalls,Nondownfalls, and apparent nondownfalls.Four parameters can be applied to each of the three kinds of ethical conduct:First, in relation to the ethical conduct of restraint from negative activity,to take life out of anger, for example, is a downfall. To kill out of altruismis an apparent downfall, which is not in fact a downfall. To not kill out ofcompassion is a nondownfall. To not kill even though such an act would helpothers is an apparent nondownfall, which is in fact a downfall.Second, these four can be applied to the ethical conduct of gathering ennoblingqualities: To not give out of greed is a downfall. To not give out of altruismis an apparent downfall. To give with a pure intention is a nondownfall. To giveout of a wish to harm others is an apparent nondownfall.Third, these four can be applied to the ethical conduct of altruistic acts: tonot attend to the sick is a downfall. To not attend to the sick in order toaccomplish something very meaningful is an apparent downfall. To attend to thesick out of love is a nondownfall. To attend to the sick by preventing otherswho are available for the task to do so or in abandoning other very meaningfulwork, such as your hearing the doctrine or renunciation (that is, engaging inmeditation practice), is an apparent nondownfall.How to Engage in Training Conscious of the Permissions and Prohibitions [b]The seven corrupting acts of body and voice are permittedIf they will surely help another. In that case, they are ennobling.If a specific act can be a means to help others, it is permitted to commit theseven physical and verbal acts from among the ten corrupting acts rejected whenyou take vows to restrain from corrupting activity. As is said,Great bodhisattvas have permission to commit the seven corrupting acts ifexamination reveals that a situation has three aspects—that the act helpsothers, knowledge that it will become helpful, and that those bodhisattvas’ennobling acts will increase rather than be obscured by that specific act.For example, it is permitted to kill a murderer to save the lives of many. Forexample, when a ship’s captain saw that a dark man with a short spear wished tokill many persons for his own ends, the captain killed him out of greatcompassion, to free him from the endless round of rebirth.Or, for example, although some do not share their wealth due to greed, during afamine when many beings’ lives are endangered, for the welfare of both rich andpoor, it is permitted to steal from the rich to give to the poor.In another example, a brahmin’s son named Joy in Stars was confronted with awoman who desired him. To prevent her certain death, he engaged in wrongfulsexual conduct with her.Likewise, it is permitted to lie to save those who will certainly be killed; orto speak divisively to separate persons from evil companions, to prevent thosepersons from being deceptively led to miserable existences; or to engage inmeaningless speech, such as relating stories from any source or whatever willmake a person laugh, to cheer up those who are depressed; or to use roughspeech, to prevent someone who will surely undertake wrongdoing.Permission is given for such acts since in fact they constitute ennobling acts.On the other hand, permission is never granted for the three corrupting mentalacts since they are always corrupting. Purification of the Mind’s Obscurationsstates:A monk encouraged his elderly fatherBy saying, “Hurry up!”In hurrying, the man died,But this was not for the monk an act of immediate fruition.With a pure intention, one person placed a shoeOn the head of a statue of Buddha ShakyamuniAnd with a similar intention, another removed it:Both acts resulted in their reaching the realm of enlightenment.Therefore, whether an act has goodness or is wrongdoingIs found in the root of its intention.The Twenty Commitments states:With compassion, out of love,And in a noble mind, there is no fault.Effective Restoration of the Training [c]This section has two parts: (1) Nagarjuna’s tradition and (2) Asanga’stradition.Nagarjuna’s Tradition of Restoration of Bodhisattva Training [i]In Nagarjuna’s tradition, the means to acknowledge downfalls is as follows: if afault has exceeded the period,It can be repaired by praying at dawn to the bodhisattva Sky Essence.Additional downfalls can be purified by recitation of The Discourse of the ThreeAggregations at the six junctures of the day.In general, the causes of giving up the commitments of awakened mind can besynthesized into three categories: rejection of the aspiration to awaken, thesupporting basis; contradiction of the training by committing a root downfall;and abandonment, by offering back the vows.On the subject of disadvantages of violating the training, there are threegeneral disadvantages of downfalls. First, in breaking a promise, you become theobject of criticism. By committing a downfall, you deceive the Teacher, theBuddha, and thereby displease the buddhas; you deceive the domain of yourconcern, sentient beings, and displease them; and you deceive yourself andundermine your own goals, thereby becoming the object of everyone’s disdain.Second, when your words lose their meaning, this draws to you all that isunwished for. It is said that, like a ruler who loses their kingdom, life willthen be inauspicious and your death will be accompanied by intense anguish.Third, since a downfall represents a fault of serious consequence, you laterfall to the miserable existences from which liberation is difficult. TheCompendium of Training states:Those root downfallsAre the cause of beings’ great hells.On the subject of offering back the vows, although permission is granted to giveback the training in the individual liberation vows if you are unable to keepthe vows, to offer back the bodhisattva commitments is a fault of direconsequences. Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:To destroy the happinessOf even one sentient being harms yourself.Thus why mention the harm in destroyingThe happiness of embodied beings whose numbers fill the infinity of space!If you have incurred a downfall due to any of four causes—ignorance,carelessness, mental afflictions, or disrespect—you can rise from this fault byrepairing it.On that subject, what is called “exceeding a period” is explained as follows:The day is divided into six periods—daytime has three junctures and the nighthas three. If you apply the remedy to an act by the end of one of those periods,your ethical conduct’s continuity remains unbroken and pure. For instance, if adownfall occurs during one of the morning periods—the initial, middle, orlater—it can be repaired if you admit it without separation from awakened mindduring any of the three periods—initial, middle, or later—of that sameafternoon. If such a time period has not elapsed, although a light fundamentaldownfall might again occur, another admission can repair and restore thecommitments. However, when the time period for admission has elapsed, yourethical conduct is affected and you cannot restore the commitments with simplereparation. In that case, you must begin with admission and a vow to not repeatthe act, followed by retaking the commitments according to that ritual,performed an undetermined number of times.Among the three specific methods to restore commitments, given in relation todegrees of practitioners’ acumen, persons of a middle degree of acumen can, ifthey wish, admit a downfall in the presence of the deity of general awarenessmantras, the exalted Bodhisattva Sky Essence. They must admit the downfallcontinually, day and night: As soon as they incur a downfall, they bathe, keepclean, and light incense. They call the exalted Bodhisattva Sky Essence by name,pay homage to him, and pray intently: “Exalted one, show yourself to me! Purifymy wrongdoing, I pray!” As a result of such prayers, the bodhisattva willappear, either directly or in a dream, in his own form or as any being fromhuman to bird, according to the individual’s fortune, and teach them how toraise themselves from the downfall.However, if the bodhisattva does not present himself, the individual must risebefore dawn, keep clean, and make offerings of incense while looking toward theeast, then recite,“Morning! Morning! Great compassionate one! Great excellent one! As soon as youarrive in the east of this world, embrace me with your compassion! May my wordsinspire Sky Essence, who is imbued with great compassion, to act quickly! Pleaseshow me in my dreams how I can quickly undo this downfall and a way to attainthe skillful means and sublime insight of the exalted great way.”Then the person sleeps: as dawn approaches, Sky Essence will show himself in adream, in a form according to the individual’s connection, and will reveal howto begin undoing the downfall.Those of average (i.e., lowest) degree of acumen rely on the four forces: theforce of the support, the object to whom admission is made; revulsion, intenseregret toward the negative act or downfall; remedial activity, for example, toconstruct sacred representations of wisdom body, speech, or mind, to recitemantras or prayers, or to say words of admission, and the like; and restoration,the determination to not repeat the act in the future, even at the cost of yourlife.Further, restoration can depend upon the persons to whom admission is made. Ifthe downfall was committed with two cases of intense involvement—to harmsentient beings out of anger or to harm Buddhism out of stupidity—or with alevel of involvement due to simple attachment or anger, admit the downfall to agroup of ten persons who keep the great way commitments; a group of five suchpersons; or one or two such individuals. However, if no such opportunity exists,any downfall can be admitted in the presence of the three jewels.In particular, at the six junctures of the day and night, recite The Discourseof the Three Aggregations. The three aggregations referred to in the title arehomage to an assembly of thirty-five buddhas, admission of faults, anddedication of goodness. Apart from fundamental downfalls, such recitation willpurify and restore other downfalls or those unrestored by other means becausethey have been forgotten or were committed unconsciously.Those of the most acute degree of acumen first admit their fault, as in a magicdisplay or a dream, in the presence of the victors and their spiritual heirsfilling space. Then they examine the essence of the fault itself. In therecognition that it is without a reference point, like the nature of space, theysettle in evenness. This liberates them from all faults and downfalls. TheDiscourse of Great Liberation states:Those who wish to purify acts they regretShould sit straight and gaze correctly,Gaze correctly at the true nature of the act.Liberation is to see that nature,The supreme purification of regretted acts.Asanga’s Tradition of Restoration of Bodhisattva Training [ii]This section has two parts: (1) identification of the causes of abandoning thetraining and (2) how to repair faults and downfalls.Identification of the Causes of Abandoning the Training [A)]In Asanga’s tradition, the fundamental downfall is to abandon another being;Auxiliary downfalls, to commit one of the four negative acts or to damage youraspiration or application.One defeating act can be motivated by great, medium, or lesser degrees ofinvolvement.These relate to varying degrees—to commit the act continually, without shame orembarrassment,To be pleased by it, and to consider it positive.To mentally abandon a sentient being (a root downfall) or to commit one of thefour negative acts (auxiliary downfalls) constitutes relinquishment of theaspiration to awaken, the underlying support of the bodhisattva path. This inturn causes the relinquishment of that which it supports, the application toawaken.If a defeating act—to criticize others and to praise yourself for gain or glory,for example—is committed with full involvement and the following four aspects,it constitutes a downfall of serious involvement: to commit the act regularly,to do so without the slightest quiver of shame or embarrassment, to take joyfulpleasure in it, and to consider it as positive. Since this destroys the vows, itis called “a defeating act.”Medium involvement is similar in every respect, except for the presence ofslight shame and embarrassment: you will stop if encouraged by others to do so.Slight involvement is characterized by similar aspects and more intense shameand embarrassment, so that even without others’ encouragement, you will soontake the initiative to stop the act. Acts done with the latter two degrees ofinvolvement do not constitute relinquishment of the vows.How to Repair Faults and Downfalls [B)]If a defeating act has been committed, the vows must be taken again.Acts done with a medium degree of involvement must be admitted before threepersons.Acts done with a lesser degree of involvement must be formally admitted beforeone person.If this is not possible, admit the act mentally in the presence of the victors.If the aspiration to awaken is relinquished or if a fundamental downfall(comparable to a defeating act for a monk or nun) has been committed with aserious degree of involvement, the commitments have been relinquished. In thatcase, after admission, commitment, cultivation of goodness and wisdom, andpurification have been practiced assiduously, the vows can be taken again.According to the great omniscient master Longchenpa, The Bodhisattvas’ Stages ofAwakening states that this retaking of the vows can be repeated no more thanthree times.Acts comparable to a defeating act, done with a medium degree of involvement,must be admitted before three or more persons. It is even possible that,depending on the motivation, acts such as fundamental downfalls done with alesser degree of involvement (or, apart from them, the forty-six infractions)can be done with or without mental afflictions, and do not constitute downfalls.Those that do constitute downfalls can be purified by admission and commitmentstaken before one or more persons.In any of these cases, if no suitable persons are available to receive youradmission, the act can be admitted and vows taken in the imagined presence ofthe victors and their spiritual heirs.THE SIX TRANSCENDENT PERFECTIONS [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-35]This chapter has two parts: (1) a brief presentation of equalizing andexchanging self and others and (2) the extensive explanation of the sixtranscendent perfections.Equalizing and Exchanging Self and Others [A]At the outset of training in the six transcendent perfections for the sake ofbeings,Recognize that all beings have been your mother and recall their kindness.Decide to repay their kindness and help them reach happiness.You have the opportunity to guide them.Do what you can. Have compassion. Uplift your mind to awakening. See them as thefocus of your spiritual practice.Helping others will accomplish your own goals, please thebuddhas,Provide aid, and do so without difficulty. Marshal the four forces.See yourself and others as equals and exchange yourself for others.Thirteen considerations make spiritual practice for the welfare of sentientbeings imperative. What are they?All sentient beings equally have been my mother and father, again and again. Atthose times, all they did was to lovingly help me; to repay their kindness, Imust serve sentient beings. The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse states:This whole earth can be rolled into balls the size of a pea. The number of timesa single sentient being has been your mother or father will exceed the number ofsuch balls of earth; the number of times each sentient being has been yourmother or father is incalculable.If I disregard the help given me by sentient beings, I will be crushed by theenormous weight of my ingratitude. To prevent this, I must do what helpssentient beings.If sentient beings lived in comfort and happiness, it could be said that my helpwas not needed. However, on my behalf, they committed wrongdoing and are nowoppressed by the round of rebirth’s sufferings and miserable realms. Therefore,to alleviate the karma of faults done on my behalf, I must serve sentientbeings.Sentient beings wish for happiness; none wishes for suffering. However, inignorance of the means to reach happiness and to avoid suffering, they live onlytormented by suffering. To change this, I must do what helps sentient beings.Countless numbers of beings were neither guided nor trained by buddhas of thepast. If I do not lead these beings, the great way’s enlightened heritage willcome to an end and sentient beings will be left without a sanctuary andprotector. Therefore, I must do what helps.Through the force of clinging to this “I” and sense of self, the winds of mymental afflictions rage and mislead me. However, since it has been said that Ican energetically formulate the aspiration to guide beings, I will do whatever Ican to help and serve sentient beings.Since all phenomena are empty and there is no existent self, I must guide withcompassion dreamlike sentient beings who have not realized this. If I do notguide them, this undermines compassion: I must serve in whatever ways helpothers.I have uplifted my mind to awakening in order to serve sentient beings. If I donot serve them, this contradicts my training: I must do what helps.My wandering throughout the round of rebirth is the consequence of my having hadhatred and other mental afflictions toward beings. Since those beings nowconstitute the supreme domain for my accomplishment of awakening, I must do whathelps them.If I actually help others, I naturally accomplish my own welfare; thus I must dowhat helps, since I will thereby naturally accomplish my own goals.If I aid sentient beings, this pleases the buddhas: I must do what helps.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Apart from making sentient beings happy,There is no other way to delight the victors.Further, after I have uplifted my mind to awakening, if I do not accomplish thewelfare of sentient beings, I fall into the ways of hearers and solitary sages:I must serve sentient beings.Ultimately, sentient beings and I have no reference points of separateness, likespace. Within that ongoing state, I can work for magic-like sentient beings on arelative level without discouragement: I must do what helps them.In brief, for even a single sentient being, I will remain within the round ofrebirth in their service until they become free. Day and night in diligence,without fatigue or disillusionment, I will work for millions of eons for theknowledge that for one instant an ennobling thought has arisen in just onesentient being’s stream of being. With such a strong intention, I must bediligent. The Ornament of the Discourses states:The victors and their spiritual heirs rely on supreme diligenceTo fully ripen the mass of sentient beings:They work for a million eons without dejectionFor a single ennobling thought to develop in a being’s mind.There are four marshaled forces. Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Interest, stability, joy, and rejection.First, the force of interest: with interest toward the benefits of the awakenedmind, undertake ennobling acts and renounce corrupting acts. The same textstates:The fear of sufferingAnd reflection on the benefits of the awakened mind foster interest.Second, the marshaled force of stability: Think, “Aside from not having upliftedmy mind to awakening, to have uplifted it then set it aside will provedetrimental to me in every way.” Thereby, you do not relinquish perseverance.Third, the marshaled force of rejection: You occasionally accept the permissiongranted to disregard the letter of some minor aspects of the training, if theseacts do not harm sentient beings. The same text states:If you are unable to maintain the discipline due to involvement in suchsituations as danger or celebration,You can do what is convenient.Fourth, the marshaled force of joy—be joyfully enthusiastic in helping sentientbeings and in accomplishing your training. Letter to a Disciple states:Someone who is about to have their head cut off for others’ sakeLooks with open, joyful eyes, like lotus flowers,And thinks of the sharpened sword raised above their headTo be like a white parasol opened for their own good.Meditation on yourself and others as equals is as follows: First develop theperception of someone, such as an enemy, as your mother. Just as you feel joy inattaining temporary happiness and ultimate well-being, this other person is nodifferent from you. You should think, “I must do whatever I can to help thisperson!” Meditate in this way, extending your range of concern from one beinguntil your concern embraces all sentient beings equal in numbers to the limitsof space.Exchanging yourself and others is as follows. After having trained your mind asabove, think, “May I mentally release whatever happiness and ennobling acts aremine, and give them to this sentient being. May that goodness cause them totemporarily reach the higher realms and, ultimately, enlightenment. May theirwrongdoing come to me, like an exchange of clothing that I accept. As these actsripen within my experience, I will feel many sufferings in their place, such asthose of the miserable existences.” You develop this exchange from the bottom ofyour heart and in your bones. Once you have done this with one sentient being,continue until you include all sentient beings.This practice purifies powerful wrongdoing you’ve accumulated since timeimmemorial. You thereby exhaust many forms of karma that would have ripenedlater in lifetimes in the miserable existences, for instance, and you gain manyforms of happiness. Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:If I don’t completely exchangeMy own happiness for others’ sufferings,I can’t accomplish enlightenmentAnd even the round of rebirth won’t hold any happiness for me.The Six Transcendent Perfections [B]This section has six parts: (1) the three kinds of generosity, (2) the threekinds of ethical conduct, (3) patience, (4) diligence, (5) meditative stability,and (6) sublime insight.The Three Kinds of Generosity [1]Generosity can be expressed to needy beings through material gifts, the gift ofspiritual teaching, and the gift of refuge from fear.Material generosity can be expressed through giving any wealth desired;Great giving—your child, spouse, or other loved ones;Or extreme giving—your head or limbs.Lesser spiritual generosity is expressed through gifts of paper, ink, or books;Great spiritual generosity is given by teaching appropriate ways of spiritualdevelopment.Generosity of refuge from fear is to provide freedom from danger.Three kinds of generosity can be offered to the poor or other beings inneed—gifts of material objects, spiritual teaching, and refuge from fear.Material generosity can be expressed in three ways: simple giving is any gift offood, clothing, horses, elephants, home, bed, or any necessary objects desired.Those incapable of such generosity should begin training in generosity by havingthe right hand place gifts of food or money in the left. Then, to train the mindfurther, they should give to others insignificant things, such as a vegetable.Gradually, when you encounter a prospective recipient for your generosity, youwill give gladly without greed, in the thought, “How wonderful! A friend hascome to help me complete the transcendent perfection of generosity for thewelfare of beings!” After familiarity in this is gained, you can proceed togreat giving—the gift of those dear to you, such as your beloved son, daughter,or spouse. Extreme giving includes such gifts as your head, arm, or leg.Lesser spiritual generosity can be expressed by such gifts as pens, ink, paper,or books; great spiritual generosity, by graded guidance in Buddhist ways ofspiritual development—lesser or great—appropriate to your degree of spiritualacumen. Lay bodhisattvas mainly practice material generosity; those who haverenounced home life, spiritual generosity. The Exalted Discourse of Prophecy inAnswer to the Questions of Lokadhara states:On this subject, material gifts complete the cultivation of goodness whereasspiritual gifts complete the cultivation of wisdom. Together they accomplish thestate of total omniscience.What is material generosity? It consists of these: simple giving, great giving,and extreme giving. What is called “simple giving” is gifts to others of food,clothing, vehicles, or elephants. What is called “great giving” is gifts of yourson, daughter, or spouse. What is called “extreme giving” is difficult to do—togive such gifts as your head, eyes, arms, legs.What is spiritual generosity? Minor spiritual generosity is gifts of pens, ink,and books. Major spiritual generosity is to convey, according to the spiritualfortune of the recipient, the instructions of hearers, solitary sages, or theunsurpassable path. Extremely great spiritual generosity is to have a persongrasp unsurpassable awakening and to convey teaching that is inconceivable, likespace.The Discourse Requested by Upali states that those who rest in forbearancetoward the unborn nature of phenomena can practice simple giving, great giving,and superb giving.Generosity of refuge from fear is to offer refuge and protection, such as youcan, from immediate danger, such as that due to sickness, demons, thieves, wildanimals, or rulers; or from ultimate danger—that of the round of rebirth and itsmiserable realms. The eight or sixteen dangers are these: fire, water, poisonoussnakes, carnivorous animals, elephants, prison, thieves, lions, rulers’punishments, enemies, demons, leprosy, separation from loved ones, poverty,lightning, and failure.What constitutes inappropriate gifts is stated in The Discourse Requested by theGreat Seer Vasya:Gifts of poison, weapons, the meat of animals you killed, or alcohol to thosewho are reckless constitute impure gifts. To give with doubt concerning a gift’seffect or with intense regret once the gift is given are also impure. To givewith the thought, “May I enjoy the ripening of the goodness of this gift; maysuch goodness not be enjoyed by others!” is also impure. When a sick or dyingperson feels no joy in or faith toward the Buddha, but the family forces them todistribute their possessions to the three jewels, this is impure. To rejectgiving to the poor and to instead give to the wealthy is also impure.Great Seer! What will the ripened effect of these acts be?Like seeds planted on salty ground, while it could be said that they willsprout, they will not bear fruit.The essence of generosity is lack of greed; its cause, the ennobling mind ofgiving; its result, the accomplishment of a magnificent body and wealth; and itsfunction, the care of both yourself and others, and the completion of the twostores of goodness and wisdom. Its special qualities are stated in The Ornamentof the Discourses:If you meet the Victor’s spiritual heirs begging, always give, even if the giftbe that of your own life.Do so with compassion to benefit others; do not expect rewards or strive fordesired results.Such generosity will place all persons in the three states of awakening.Generosity fully guided by wisdom is inexhaustible within every world.The Three Kinds of Ethical Conduct [2]The three kinds of ethical conduct are restraint from faulty conduct,Gathering ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.The first of the three kinds of ethical conduct is restraint from faultyconduct. In presenting the seven kinds of individual liberation vows, TheBodhisattva’s Stages of Awakening explains that restraint from faulty conductwithin your own stream of being consists of uplifting the mind to awakening inaspiration and application, based on any of those seven ordinations.Nevertheless, in the context of the bodhisattva commitments, whether or not anindividual has previously taken one of the seven kinds of individual liberationvows, the renunciation of harming others, along with its basis, constitutesindividual liberation vows. Moreover, renunciation of faulty conduct in order towork for others’ welfare constitutes the bodhisattva vows.Second, the ethical conduct of gathering ennobling qualities is defined as theintention to renounce any corrupting act and its basis, in order to give rise inyour stream of being to ennobling qualities (summarized as the two stores ofgoodness and wisdom, and the six transcendent perfections) that have not yetarisen and to increase those that have.Third, the ethical conduct of altruistic acts is defined as the intention torenounce and guard against any thought or its basis that is inconsistent withthe intention that all thoughts and acts be directly or indirectly skillfulmeans to serve sentient beings, in order to accomplish altruistic acts.Moreover, if an act can serve others, it is permitted, even if it appears tocontradict the ethical conduct of restraint of vows or that of gatheringennobling qualities. The stories of Captain Great Compassion and the brahminyouth Joy in Stars [mentioned above in the section “How to Engage in TrainingConscious of the Permissions and Prohibitions”] provide examples of this.The essence of ethical conduct has six aspects, as taught in The Stages of theHearers: to remain within the bounds of ethical conduct, to be restrained by thevows of individual liberation, to have a perfect ritual, to sustain theexcellent domain of conduct, to regard any degree of faulty conduct withapprehension, and to engage correctly in the bases of training.The substance of ethical conduct is acts that lead to the transcendence ofsorrow. Its result is life within happy existences. Its function is to provide abasis for all positive qualities. Moreover, it pacifies mental afflictions andfrees you and others from fear. Its quality is its endowment with thecultivation of goodness.Ethical conduct has two categories: that which is correctly undertaken andarises through symbols, and that which arises through the nature of reality. Thefirst refers to the individual liberation vows. The second, ethical conduct thatarises through the nature of reality, is twofold—that which arises frommeditative stability and that which arises from states without contamination bycorrupting influences. The ethical conduct that arises from meditative stabilityis attained in the main practice of mental training. The ethical conduct thatarises from states without contamination, such as the path of seeing, areattained on the stages of exalted bodhisattvas. The Treasury of ObservedPhenomena states:Ethical conduct refers to the vows of individual liberation,And, likewise, to that which arises from meditative stability and lack ofcontamination.Ethical conduct to be developed becomes the support for positive qualities whenit has these four aspects: it is unimpaired, it is not mingled with the hearers’and solitary sages’ attitudes, it is unpolluted with faults or downfalls, and itis blameless since it belongs to the great way. Letter from a Spiritual Friendstates:You must anchor ethical conduct so that it remains unimpaired, blameless,Unadulterated, and unpolluted.Such conduct is said to be the basis for all positive qualities,Like the earth for the animate and the inanimate.The positive qualities of ethical conduct are stated in The Ornament of theDiscourses:Always undertake the three kinds of ethical conduct that have the nature of thevows and diligence of the victors’ spiritual heirs:Even without a conscious wish for the higher realms, you will fully attain themand not develop attachment to them.Such ethical conduct itself will place all beings in the three states ofawakening.Ethical conduct guided by wisdom is inexhaustible within any world.Patience [3]This section has seven parts: (1) a general presentation of the three kinds ofpatience, (2) how to cultivate patience, (3) the need to discipline your mindrather than to control what is causing you harm, (4) how harmful circumstancesperfect patience, (5) the reflection that causes of anger arise from yourself,(6) the reflection on whether or not what is undesirable can be changed, and (7)the presentation of the nature of anger as emptiness.The Three Kinds of Patience [a]The three kinds of patience are to accept suffering, to not dwell on harm done,And definite realization of the teachings.The first of the three kinds of patience is patient acceptance of suffering:This is to accept without regret the immediate suffering of hardship inspiritual practice in order to gain long-term, unsurpassable happiness. Thisresembles acceptance of medical treatment in order to end the pain of sickness.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Isn’t it better for a person condemned to deathTo have a hand cut off and then be freed?Isn’t it better for human beings to experience suffering during this lifeIf this frees them from hell?The second is to not dwell on harm done. Just as a small spark can ignite a hugepile of straw, when you or those whom you hold dear are abused physically orverbally, one moment of anger can dissipate the excellent acts you accumulatedover a thousand eons. Conscious of this drawback of anger, be patient: do notget upset, do not take revenge, and do not hang on to resentment. The same textstates:No negative act equals anger;No ascetic practice equals patience.Therefore, meditate assiduously on various waysTo be patient.The third is definite realization of the teachings: This is to not bedisheartened by compassionate, altruistic acts and to not be anxious towardprofound emptiness understood through sublime insight.The essence of patience is to not be angry toward others and to toleratehardships. Its substance is compassion. Its result has five benefits, as adiscourse states:To have little anger; to have little discord; to enjoy much comfort and mentalhappiness; to have no regrets at death; and once this body passes away, to bereborn in the worlds of higher, happy existences.The function of patience is ennobling acts that serve both you and others. TheCollection of Sayings states:When you know that another is in turmoil,If you thoroughly calm yourself,This helps bothYou and the other.The positive qualities of patience are stated in The Ornament of the Discourses:Such patience places all persons in the three states of awakening.How to Cultivate Patience [b]Patience constitutes supreme goodness, the most exemplary ascetic practice.Anger causes rebirth in the hells: you should avoid it.Patience constitutes the most exalted goodness, the cause of the accomplishmentof enlightenment, and the most exemplary ascetic practice: you should meditateupon it. Anger causes rebirth in the hells: avoid it in any way possible. Letterfrom a Spiritual Friend states:Thus, since no ascetic practice equals patience,Don’t give anger an opportunity to arise.By renouncing anger, you will gain the state of no-return:This is the Buddha’s promise.The Need to Discipline Your Mind Rather Than to Control What Is Causing You Harm[c]Things that cause harm are numerous: it is difficult to neutralize them all.If you only discipline your mind, you will neutralize all negativecircumstances.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Savage sentient beings are so numerous that they can fill all space:It’s impossible to defeat them all.However, when you control this single angry mind of yours,It is as if you subdue all those foes.How Harmful Circumstances Perfect Patience [d]By using harmful circumstances, you perfect patience.Think of the kindness of enemies; feel gratitude toward them.Patience, the cause of attaining enlightenment, must be cultivated based on yourenemies; you should consider that any harmful being is very kind. Since theslight suffering, such as mental distress, you feel when harmed can become thecatalyst for the arising of compassion or disillusionment with the round ofrebirth, you should be patient. The same text states:Moreover, suffering has positive qualities:Disillusionment rids you of arrogance,You develop compassion for beings within the round of rebirth,You avoid wrongdoing, and you delight in ennobling acts.Further, cultivation of patience in the face of hatred yields tremendousgoodness: feel inclined and respectful toward your enemies as if they were theTeacher. The Highest Continuity states:Feel as inclined and respectful toward harmful persons as you do toward theTeacher.The Reflection That Causes of Anger Arise from Yourself [e]Harm, disturbance, and suffering arise from your karma:To discipline karma’s source, your mind, is vital.All harm and suffering arise from doing evil deeds: what harm you do to othersnow will return to you. The source of present harm or suffering can be found inyourself; therefore, be patient with others. Entering the Conduct ofBodhisattvas states:If I had not harmed others in the past,Nothing would harm me now.The same text states:In the past, I did these same harmful thingsTo sentient beings,Therefore, when sentient beings injure me,It is right that such things occur.If something harmful incites your anger, you should direct that anger towardyour own mental afflictions. The same text states:Summoned by things I’ve done,This harm now befalls me.If actual harm incites your anger, you should direct your anger at inert forms,such as rocks or clubs, or unpleasant words. The same text states:If someone actually uses clubs or other weapons against me,Should I be angry at the weapons’ wielder,Who is driven by anger?It is better to be angry at anger.If your possessions are harmed, don’t be angry. If you have done good deeds,wealth is inexhaustible; without having done good deeds, anything at all canexhaust your possessions. The faults of wealth are endless, don’t fosterattachment to it. If your reputation is slandered, reputation is nothing butwords; words are inert and not of the slightest use. If you become angry atunpleasant words, since they are the aggressor’s words, why be angry? Even theirwish to speak came from their pride: it is unnecessary to be angry. However, ifyou become miserable and angry, it makes sense to be angry at your own mind.Whatever unhappiness you have comes from yourself: the other’s words haven’tshifted to you and can’t cause you pain; yet when you accept them, they do. Ifyou don’t become unhappy, words themselves create neither help nor harm.Thus, instants of any previous pleasure or pain have ceased, like yesterday’sevents or like last night’s dreams: they cannot return, they are intangible, andthey are equal in their lack of intrinsic nature. Anger is groundless. Likewise,today’s events are like those of tonight’s dreams: it is not right to beattached to the reality of pleasure or pain.The Reflection on Whether or Not What Is Undesirable Can Be Changed [f]If the situation can be changed, why be unhappy?If no change is possible, of what use is sadness?If what is undesirable can be changed, you can apply yourself to the means toeffect that change, in which case unhappiness is of no use at all. If asituation definitely cannot be changed, there is no point to sadness, sincesadness is incapable of changing the situation. Entering the Conduct ofBodhisattvas states:However, if the situation can be changed,What need is there for unhappiness?However, if the situation cannot be changed,What use is sadness?Therefore, don’t become angry, even for the sake of those close to you, such asyour parents or entourage. Don’t even become angry toward others for the sake ofsuch as your teacher, preceptor, spiritual master, or the three jewels. If youget angry, not only will this not help them, this will cause very significantharm to you and others now and in the future. When others harm you in minor ormajor ways, such as with unpleasant words, stealing your wealth, or beating you,anger does not help the situation. Therefore, think that now and in the future,to apply yourself to patience for your own and others’ happiness constitutes thesupreme cultivation of goodness.The Nature of Anger as Emptiness [g]The object of anger and the angry individual lack an intrinsic nature and arenaturally empty.If there is no intrinsic self, what self is there to cling to? What cannot betolerated?The forms of anger’s objects and the angry individual have not even theslightest tangible substance: the harmer and the one harmed do not exist. Theirminds cannot be located anywhere outside or inside: the harmer and the harmed donot exist. If examined, the other’s words do not exist in essence: the harmer,the harm, and the harmed share the same nature of emptiness. Within this nature,there is neither pleasure nor sadness, neither good nor evil, neither gain norloss. Despite the seeming appearance of harm, its essence does not exist. Thus,such appearances are like relative truth’s eight metaphors for illusion, such asan emanation or an optical illusion. Ultimately, appearances are like space:cultivate patience. Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Once I recognize this, I cannot become angryAt material objects that are like an emanation.Meditation in these various ways produces effortless patience. The same textstates:There is nothing that is not easyOnce you become familiar with it.As described here, cultivation of patience will create happiness even duringthis life: you will live in harmony with everyone and others will find youattractive. In later lives, you will take a special rebirth in higher realms andaccomplish awakening. The same text states:My future accomplishment of enlightenmentComes from pleasing sentient beings, but apart from that,Why can’t I also see that during this life,Great glory, fame, and happiness also come from the same source?While in the round of rebirth, patience brings me beauty and other qualities,Renown, and freedom from sickness.These in turn help me live longAnd attain the happy reign of a universal monarch.Diligence [4]This section has four parts: (1) the three kinds of diligence, (2) renunciationof the three forms of laziness, (3) the measure of the qualities of diligence,and (4) instruction in the necessity of diligence through a presentation of itsbenefits.The Three Kinds of Diligence [a]The three forms of diligence to be undertaken are the armor of intention,application to acts,And joyful service to sentient beings.The first of the three kinds of diligence is the armor of intention, which freesyou from being overcome by negative influences. It is the thought, “Until allsentient beings are placed in perfect awakening, I will not abandon diligence,”and to then undertake diligent activity, undeterred by fluctuations in negativeor positive circumstances.The second is the diligence of practical application, which causes thecompletion of awakening’s five paths and ten stages. This diligence is toundertake the gathering of ennobling acts with enthusiastic dedication togaining the positive qualities of renunciation and realization. Once begun, youpractice courageously and, even if the slightest positive quality fails to showitself, you firmly apply yourself to ennobling acts in body, speech, and mind,with ever-increasing diligence.The third is the diligence of joyfully serving sentient beings, the cause of theachievement of your own and others’ goals. Joyously undertake working for otherswith diligence in body, speech, and mind, using a variety of means to ensuresentient beings’ immediate welfare and their ultimate happiness. The Compendiumof Training states:Fully joyous in armor, practical application, not transgressing the vows, notturning back, and not being complacently satisfied.The Journey to Langka Discourse states:Diligence is energetic application during the first and last parts of the day tostem discursive thoughts, by those who see this as conducive to theircontemplative practice: such effort constitutes the transcendent perfection ofdiligence.The Ornament of the Discourses states:These seven facetsAre what the wise fully know to be diligenceThat they correctly practice:True joy in ennobling acts,Stability in faith and positive intention,Increase of such positive qualities as mindfulness,The antidote to pervasive mental afflictions,Nonattachment, and other noble qualities.Nagarjuna states:If your hair or clothing suddenly catch fire,You drop what you were doing to put it out.Likewise, you must strive to end future rebirths,Since nothing is more urgent than that.Renunciation of the Three Forms of Laziness [b]Three kinds of laziness must be rejected: attachment to negative acts thatshould be renounced,Inertia, and underestimating yourself.Laziness increases all faults and clouds all ennobling acts, ensuring failure.Any of the endless, negative activity related to this life we’re familiarwith—business, farming, divinations, astrology, various kinds of building,gambling, song, dance, games, tending animals, meetings, entertainment, and soon—become habitual occupations to which we increasingly apply ourselves andwhich we find impossible to give up. It seems to us that we have no spare timeto apply ourselves to our spiritual lives. This interruption to our spiritualpractice constitutes the laziness of attachment to negative acts.When we see the difficulty of spiritual practice we think, “I can’t accomplishthat!” and we give up our application—this is the laziness of inertia.The fainthearted conclusion, “That kind of spiritual practice is beyond someonelike me!” constitutes the laziness of underestimating yourself. Entering theConduct of Bodhisattvas states:Laziness is attachment to what is negative,Inertia, and lack of self-confidence.The Measure of the Qualities of Diligence [c]Diligence attracts praise from worldly people and leads to achieving goals,The increase of every quality, and the quick attainment of enlightenment.The benefits of being endowed with diligence are limitless; in brief, diligenceattracts the praise of worldly persons and leads to achieving wished-for goals,the increase of positive qualities, and the attainment of enlightenment.Instruction in the Necessity of Diligence through a Presentation of Its Benefits[d]All worldly and transcendent fortune and excellenceAre achieved through energetic diligence: develop enduring and enthusiasticdiligence.All worldly and transcendent fortune and excellence are achieved through theforce of physical energy, verbal effort, and mental diligence: develop diligencethat is enduringly strong and wholly joyful. Entering the Conduct ofBodhisattvas states:What is diligence? It is joy in ennobling acts.The essence of diligence is joy in ennobling acts. Faith and positive intentionare its substance. Increase in mindfulness and meditative states, and so on, areits results. A noble mind free from the three poisons is its quality. Diligencehas seven categories: continual physical application to the three trainings, andphysical respect for them; continual verbal application to the three trainings,and verbal respect for them; continual mental application to the threetrainings, and mental respect for them; thus two for each, plus the diligence ofarmor. The Ornament of the Discourses states:The victors’ spiritual heirs have the incomparable diligence of armor and ofapplication.Diligence subdues your own and others’ mental afflictions and causes theattainment of true awakening.Such diligence places all persons in the three states of awakening.Diligence guided by wisdom is inexhaustible within any world.You might think that you cannot possibly be as diligent as the victors’ heirs intheir conduct, such as cultivating of stores of goodness and wisdom during threeincalculable eons or sacrificing your head or limbs, but such an attitude is dueto not having examined your own situation. In answer to the first point, duringthe three incalculable eons that you cultivate stores of goodness and wisdom,sentient beings will continue, as before, to experience the unbearablesufferings of the round of rebirth in general and those of the miserableexistences in particular. For the second point, in any event, in one lifetime oranother in the future, you will certainly have to experience uncountablesufferings, such as having your head or limbs cut off.Meditative Stability [5]This section has six parts: (1) requisites for the practice of meditativestability, (2) what is detrimental to meditative stability, (3) the faults ofcompanionship, (4) the need to always stay in retreat, (5) the arising ofexperience and realization in retreat and its benefits, and (6) how to meditateand its qualities.Requisites for the Practice of Meditative Stability [a]Renunciation of distraction and busyness are requisites for the practice ofmeditative stability.Sensual pleasures and possessions are impermanent: remain in isolated places.All composite phenomena are impermanent, all wealth is unstable, and life isimpermanent and pointless; therefore, you should devote yourself to meditationalone in a peaceful forest. The Discourse of Individual Liberation states:The learned find within forestsA happy residence for those whose youth has elapsed.What Is Detrimental to Meditative Stability [b]To accumulate, guard, and search for possessions causes suffering;Vanity, craving, and greed lead to the miserable existences.Outer material objects provide the source for many corrupting acts: you mustsearch for them, guard them, and be aggressive; they create such things asmental misery, craving, vanity, and deceit. Since they make you plummet to theground of the miserable existences, you should renounce them. Nagarjuna states:Accumulating, guarding, and searching for wealth entails suffering:Know it to cause endless trouble.Those with few desires are praised by all; those without wealth do not have toguard against thieves; those without many preoccupations and whose bodies andminds are relaxed naturally accomplish meditative states and have many positivequalities, such as little deceit. On the other hand, the extent of your wealthequals the extent of your suffering, just as nagas suffer in the measure oftheir heads. Letter from a Spiritual Friend states:Therefore, just as those with many possessions suffer,Those with few desires do not.The supreme nagas’ number of headsEquals the extent of their suffering.The Garland of Jewels states:In general, attachment to a man or womanArises from the thought that the body is clean.In fact, however,There is nothing clean about the body:To begin with, in the mouth, spit is rotten, and . . .The Faults of Companionship [c]Companionship with spiritually immature persons increases wrongdoing and cloudsyour ennobling acts.Such persons are difficult to please, have many plans, and foster arguments—suchfriendships are like poisonous snakes.Because sentient beings have different minds, it is impossible to please others,no matter what you do. Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:Sentient beings have various interests,Not even the Victor could please them all:What can be said about an evil person like me?The same text states:If I act in the same way as the spiritually immature,I will certainly go to the miserable existences.If their examples lead to such misfortune,Why should I stay with such persons?In an instant, they become friendsAnd in another moment, foes.They’re angry at what should make them happy:Ordinary individuals are difficult to please!They become angry at helpful wordsAnd discourage me from what is useful.If I do not listen to them,Their anger at me sends them to miserable existences.Jealous of the higher, competitive with equals,Arrogant toward those lower, swollen when praised,And incensed when one unpleasant word is spoken:When will relationships with the spiritually immature ever be helpful?The Need to Always Stay in Retreat [d]Until you gain stability, life in your homeland is deceptive.Always remain in retreat on a pleasant mountainside.Until you gain stability from having your mind and the profound teachings mergein a single flavor, busyness is harmful. Therefore, beginners should live inretreat. The Jewel Basket Discourse states:Beginners should stay in retreat, to fully pacify and thoroughly subdue theirminds.Advice on Retreat states:Until I am carried from hereOn a bier lifted by four persons,I will remain here in the wilderness,Engaged in spiritual practice, absorbed in peace.Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas states:In the forest,Birds, deer, and trees don’t say unpleasant things.When will I ever be able to dwellWith such pleasant company?The same text states:Therefore, in splendidly bright and joyful forests,All distraction stilled,Happy, carefree,And alone shall I dwell.The Arising of Experience and Realization in Retreat and Its Benefits [e]In retreat, various experiences and realizations naturally arise.Seven steps toward retreat surpass an eon of offering to the victors.By staying in retreat, various positive qualities of spiritual experience andrealization, such as impermanence and disillusionment with the round of rebirth,naturally arise and ennobling spiritual practice increases. The DiscourseRequested by Purna states:Interest in staying in the mountains or in forestsIncreases the source of positive qualities.Live in retreat, stay there,And thereby completely relinquish attachment to the pleasures of the fivesenses.Thus freed from busyness,Conditions that nurture ennobling qualities will not deteriorate.The Sovereign Meditative State Discourse states:Compared to having made during an eon offerings of flowers, incense, food, andpleasing objects to all buddhas, to take seven steps in the direction of anisolated hermitage with an attitude of complete disillusionment constitutes aninfinitely greater collection of goodness:Completely relinquish concern with your life and well-being:Meditate on the sublime peace of emptiness.In diligence, with a thoroughly enthusiastic mind,Live in the wilderness like a deer.How to Meditate and Its Qualities [f]In the main practice of meditative stability, assume the seven-point postureAnd rest the mind focused on an object, such as the form of the Buddha.Practice the meditative stability of the spiritually immature—The four levels of mental stability and the four formless levels;Full discernment of the meaning; and the sacred noble meditative stability ofthe blissful buddhas.Know the differences between these three meditative states—For those who have not entered the path, for those who have entered it, and themeditative state of exalted bodhisattvas.The nine ways of placing the mind, the ten discordant influences,The six impediments, the eight remedial mental formations,And three meditative states—magic, warrior’s movement, and vajra-like—Result in the qualities of divine sight, clairvoyance, and miraculous powers.On a comfortable seat, assume the seven-point posture of the Buddha Illuminator:your legs in vajra posture; hands in the gesture of settling in evenness; bodykept straight; shoulders held neither high nor low; eyes’ gaze on the tip of thenose; lips and teeth not touching, and the tip of the tongue joined to thepalate; and the chin slightly drawn in toward the neck.When you take this posture, the movement of your breath is neither loud, norpanting, nor wild: your inhalation and exhalation are even. Focus the mind for along time, one-pointedly without distraction to other subjects, on any supportfor meditative stability, such as the Buddha’s form. The Sovereign MeditativeState Discourse states:Place the mind fully on the body, of a gold-like color,Of the Lord of the World.Those who settle their minds on that focusAre called bodhisattvas settled in evenness.Tranquility meditation is to restrain yourself with the cord of mindfulnesswithin that ongoing state, immersed in constant focus, your attention not stolenby such influences as depression or elation. The definition of insightmeditation is complete knowledge of the nature of that ongoing state. The Cloudof Jewels Discourse states:Tranquility is the one-pointed mind;Insight is correct discernment.Worldly meditative stability practiced by the spiritually immature encompassesthe four levels of meditative stability and the states of composure of the fourformless realms as experienced by individuals who have not entered the Buddhistpath. The presence of both thoughts (and related factors) and examination (andrelated factors) constitutes the preliminary to the first level of meditativestability. When desire’s craving and negative acts’ attributes have beensurpassed, and when there is thought, examination, joy, and exaltation, this iscalled “the first level of meditative stability.” When there is no thought, justthe presence of examination, this is called “the special mind of the first levelof meditative stability.”When there is neither thought nor examination, but there is freedom fromattachment to the first level of meditative stability and the presence of joy,exaltation, and inner complete lucidity, this is called “the second level ofmeditative stability.” When there is freedom from craving for the second levelof meditative stability and the presence of exaltation, equanimity,recollection, and mindfulness, this is called “the third level of meditativestability.” When there is freedom from craving for the third level of meditativestability and when there is neither suffering nor exaltation, but there is thepresence of equanimity and recollection, this is called “the fourth level ofmeditative stability.” Each of these levels of meditative stability serves asthe preliminary for the next.In the same manner, tranquility meditation on the four states of composure ofthe formless heavens leads to ordinary existences.Transcendent meditation has two forms: First, meditative stability that fullydiscerns the meaning actualizes the path of liberation after you enter theBuddhist path and while you tread the paths of cultivation and application.Second, the noble meditative stability of the blissful buddhas is theuncontaminated meditative stability of exalted bodhisattvas who have reached orsurpassed the first stage of awakening.The essence of meditation is one-pointed resting within the mind. Itsaccomplishment depends on the conducive condition of diligence in continualmindfulness. This is the only thing that must be done. The Ornament of theDiscourses states:Meditation depends upon inner poise,Upon mindfulness, and upon diligence.The nine ways of placing the mind are listed in texts of The TranscendentPerfection of Sublime Insight collection:To place the mind as the Buddha taught, continual placing, repeated placing,firm placing, disciplined placing, calming, complete calming, one-pointedplacement, and placement in evenness.The meaning of these nine terms is as follows: first, to place the mind on afocal point; second, to place it there continually; third, to relinquishdistraction when you are aware of it; fourth, once distraction is relinquished,to repeatedly place the mind on the focal point; fifth, to develop joy; sixth,to see the shortcomings of distraction and thus to fully calm unhappiness;seventh, to rid yourself of such things as torpor and sleepiness; eighth, tohave no engagement in concepts since you have no obvious intentional effort; andninth, the mind settles when you make it even.The ten discordant influences are listed in The Mindfulness Discourse:Child of enlightened heritage! Ten influences hinder the meditative stabilityand the recitation practice of bodhisattvas. What are they? To listen to news ofmundane affairs; to draw pictures; to write poetry; to consider the planets andstars’ conjunctions (that is, astrology); ownership of food and possessions; tothink of creating wealth, like a female cannibal spirit; to petition a ruler; tonot ask questions of the wise; to be invited as a guest to parties; and toassociate and live with others.The six impediments are the following: laziness, forgetting the focus of themeditation, depression, elation, lack of effort, and effort.The remedies for these, eight mental formations of renunciation, are thefollowing. The first four counteract laziness: faith, directed intent, effort,and becoming well trained. These refer to fully confident faith in the positivequalities of meditative states; and undertaking heartfelt diligent action. Theforce of these makes the mind pliable, which in turn leads to attainment of thehappiness of a well-trained body and mind, which counteract laziness. Likewise,recollection is the remedy to forgetting the focus of the meditation,mindfulness is the remedy to depression and elation, conscientiousness is theremedy for lack of effort, and equanimity is the remedy for effort. These eightmental formations of renunciation produce effective meditative states and permitthe accomplishment of all the positive qualities of miraculous powers. Adiscourse states:Meditate on the supports of miraculous powers endowed with the eight mentalformations of renunciation.Further, the differences between the magic-like meditative state, the warrior’smovement meditative state, and the vajra-like meditative state are described asfollows. The first is to gain a perfect meditative state by the sight of andfamiliarization with all relative phenomena as the eight metaphors forillusion.33 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st33] Thereby, all composite phenomena ingeneral, the five psychophysical aggregations, the stages of the production ofexistence, and, in particular, the aggregation of consciousness, creator ofeverything, are seen to resemble a magical illusion in that they lack a sourceor a fixed location. You integrate into your meditative experience settling inevenness in the sight of phenomena as magic-like appearances. After you masterthat experience, the meditative state of that sight becomes uninterrupted inpostmeditative experience. This completely purifies the obscurations ofmanifestation: you attain mastery of manifestation at will, like a magician;thus, the name “magic-like meditative state.”Second, the warrior’s movement meditative state: when bodhisattvas rest onawakening’s tenth stage, the sublime insight of the uncontaminated meditativestate’s postmeditative state features conduct with acts as prodigious as thoseof transcendent buddhas. However, since such bodhisattvas neither need todescend into transcendence of sorrow without remainder nor need to rise from astate of cessation, their stage is special and their acts are outstandingcompared with bodhisattvas on awakening’s lower stages. Further, since theirenlightenment produces acts of demonstrating wisdom forms, theirs is thewarrior’s movement meditative state. For example, when warriors enter battle, anarmy’s four divisions accompany them; wherever a universal monarch goes, sevenpossessions accompany him. This term (that is, “the warrior’s movementmeditative state”) and its definition relate to a brave warrior who conquersothers; thus, wherever bodhisattvas who have reached this meditative state go,awakening’s positive qualities follow. Therefore it is called, “the warrior’smovement meditative state.” The culmination of this meditative state’s fullpower occurs at awakening’s eighth stage. There is also a way to train in thisfor those on the path of application, as merely conduct based on intention.Third, the vajra-like meditative state occurs on the path without interruptionof renunciation on awakening’s ninth stage once you have renounced the worldlymeditation of the peak of existence. The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:The path without interruption on awakening’s ninth stage Is the vajra-likemeditative state.A vajra can crush all material substance; likewise, this meditative state cancrush all subtle or wide-ranging phenomena. Thus it is called “the vajra-likemeditative state.” The Compendium of Observed Phenomena states:Why is this called the vajra-like meditative state? Because it encompasses thepath of application [here referring t0 a set of experiences at awakening’s ninthstage] and encompasses the path without interruption. It encompasses the path ofapplication—after it, no obscurations can divide it; all obscurations aredestroyed. It encompasses the path without interruption—the knowledge thatwhatever precedes it is exhausted and the knowledge that those things will notagain arise.From the lesser way’s perspective, the meaning of “cannot divide it” (in thelast quotation) refers to the recession of the smallest among the faintobscurations of mental afflictions; from the great way perspective, to therecession of the most subtle among the subtle cognitive obscurations. The sametext states:Why is this called “the path of application”? Through it mental afflictions arerenounced.On the path of application, once the path’s essence has been attained, allobscurations do not return to divide it; rather, it destroys all externalobscurations. The vajra-like meditative state that encompasses the path withoutinterruption represents the culmination of wisdom since in the next instant, thepath of no further training arises.The relative proportion of meditative states and sublime insight is stated inThe Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse:Hearers do not see the transcendent buddhas’ enlightened heritage (that is,their buddha nature) due to the disproportionate greatness of their meditativestates and the relative faintness of their sublime insight. Although it could besaid that the bodhisattvas see it, their sight is indistinct, due to thedisproportionate greatness of their sublime insight and the faintness of theirmeditative states. The transcendent buddhas see everything since theirtranquility and insight are balanced.The results of meditative stability are stated in The Concise Discourse of thePerfection of Sublime Insight:Through meditative stability, the sense pleasures are disdained and rejected;And awareness, clairvoyance, and meditative states are actualized.Meditative stability’s essence is inner containment of the mind. Continualvigilance and diligence cause it. The Ornament of the Discourses states:Quickly realize you are distracted,And return again to meditation.Meditative stability’s function is to induce happiness and to provide the basisfor the accomplishment of miraculous powers. Its positive qualities are to turnthe mind away from sensual pleasures, to pacify the mental afflictions withinthemselves, to stimulate experience of various gateways to meditative states ofjoy in staying only in retreat, and to accomplish others’ welfare through thedawning of clairvoyance. The six forms of clairvoyance are stated in TheTreasury of Observed Phenomena:Miracles; hearing; to know others’ thoughts;Knowledge of past lives; death, transmigration, and rebirth;And knowledge of cessation—these are preliminary to . . .These can be explained as knowledge of the domain of miracles; knowledge ofdivine hearing; knowledge of others’ thoughts; knowledge of recollection of pastlives; knowledge of death, transmigration, and rebirth; and knowledge of thecessation of contamination. A Commentary to the Certain Intention states:Maitreya! Know that the worldly and transcendent ennobling qualities of thehearers, bodhisattvas, and all transcendent buddhas are the result oftranquility and insight meditations.Sublime Insight [6]This section has two parts: (1) a brief presentation of sublime insight and (2)the extensive explanation.A Brief Presentation of Sublime Insight [a]The view is the self’s lack of intrinsic nature, the meaning free fromformulation.Sublime insight gained in hearing the doctrine, and in reflection and meditationupon itEstablishes that view, overcomes accumulated mental afflictions, and leads totranscendence of existence.Hearing the doctrine provides knowledge of the exact nature or abiding state ofphenomena. After reflection confirms this knowledge, meditation bringsliberation from the ocean of existence. These three stages are considered to bethe nature of sublime insight. The Short Commentary (by Haribhadra on ThePerfection of Sublime Insight) states:Sublime insight that has arisen from hearing the doctrine, and from reflectionand meditation upon it, or from the preparatory stages, main practice, andconclusion of meditative states . . .Sublime insight is referred to as insight (literally, “higher vision”): it isconsiderably higher than the other transcendent perfections. At the stage ofordinary individuals, sublime insight that arises from hearing the doctrine isimportant, since without such hearing, you are incapable of reflection andmeditation. The Highest Continuity states:Acts of generosity bring wealth;Ethical conduct, higher existences; and meditation, relinquishment of mentalafflictions.Sublime insight accomplishes the relinquishment of all obscurations of mentalafflictions and cognitive obscurations;Thus it is supreme. Its primary cause is hearing the doctrine.The same text states:Sublime insight is supreme.Its foundation is hearing the doctrine, thus such hearing is supreme.The Extensive Explanation of Sublime Insight [b]This section has three parts: (1) sublime insight gained from hearing thedoctrine, (2) sublime insight gained from reflection, and (3) sublime insightgained from meditation.Sublime Insight Gained from Hearing the Doctrine [i]This section has two parts: (1) explanation of the precious keys to analysis and(2) the treasury of sacred doctrine analyzed.The Precious Keys to Analysis [A)]This section also has two parts: (1) explanation of definitive and inductivemeanings and (2) explanation of intention and indirect intention, to clarify thetwo levels of meaning and to understand the nature of correct intention.Definitive and Inductive Meanings [1)]Hearing concerns analysis and what is analyzed.Analysis that reveals the true state is definitive meaning;Analysis that reveals the means to enter the basic character of being isinductive meaning.The definitive meaning is this: the nature of all phenomena, the basic space ofsuchness, is naturally pure. Further, the nondual realization of the luminousnature of mind is naturally pure, without change and transition, beyondcoming-into-being, abiding, or cessation—the essence of space. Every part of thecanon and treatises that presents this is gathered into the category of textsthat present the definitive meaning.The inductive meaning is that the extent of objective phenomena’sappearances—such as the stages of their coming-into-being, cessation, coming,going, purity, impurity, psychophysical aggregations, sense elements, and sensebases—appear in myriad forms, as in a dream, and are analyzed, elaborated, andtaught through systematic reflection and verbalization. The parts of the canonand treatises that teach this are gathered into the category of texts thatpresent the inductive meaning. For example, to proudly reflect upon and toexpress “The nature of mind is like space” is relative truth; the actual,ultimate basic character of being is the correct, definitive meaning. The MiddleWay Praise of the Inconceivable states:“Phenomena are empty”:This is the teaching called the definitive meaning.What teaches arising, cessation, and so on,And the lives of sentient beings, and so on,Is inductive meaning; it is relative truth.The Discourse Requested by Inexhaustible Intellect states:What are the discourses of definitive meaning? What are the discourses ofinductive meaning? Discourses taught to induce entry into the path are those ofinductive meaning. Discourses taught to induce entry into the result are thoseof definitive meaning.In brief, the abiding state of the basic character of being and the discoursesthat present it are called the definitive meaning and its category ofdiscourses. Instruction to provide means to enter that basic character of being,teachings of the many means to draw sentient beings’ minds to it, such as impuredelusion and its categories, is called inductive meaning and inductive teaching.This is called “the mirror to view the teachings” and “the first key to open theteachings.”Intention and Indirect Intention [2)]This section has two parts: (1) the four intentions and (2) the four indirectintentions.The Four Intentions [a)]Intention and indirect intention elucidate these two meanings.Intention comprises intention directed toward evenness, other meanings,Other times, and individuals’ attitudes.The teachings of four intentions are slightly elaborated, when for specificreasons, the teachings are not expressed explicitly. The Ornament of theDiscourses states:These are known as the four intentions:Teaching given in consideration of evenness,Other meanings, other times,And specific individuals.Of these four categories, the first is intention directed toward evenness. Thisis illustrated by the statement, “At that time, I was the Transcendent OneAll-Seeing,” said from the perspective of evenness within the formless body ofultimate enlightenment.Second, intention directed toward other meanings is illustrated by thestatement, “All phenomena lack an essential nature.” Such a statement can bemade from the three perspectives of the lack of essential nature (conceptual,relational, and absolute). These three are explained as follows: From theperspective of the conceptual lack of essential nature, the meaning of thestatement is that attributes lack an essential nature, in that ultimately theyhave no definite existence.From the perspective of the relational lack of essential nature, the meaning ofthe statement is that coming-into-being lacks an essential nature. Fourpropositions (or “four limits”) prove that coming-into-being does not exist:Coming-into-being does not arise of itself, since coming-into-being and a momentof coming-into-being contradict substance. Coming-into-being does not arise froman other, since examination of a distinct, separate other shows that it does notexist. That coming-into-being arises from both contradicts substance; thus, itdoes not exist. That coming-into-being arises without a cause is impossible.The extent to which coming-into-being, and so on, (in other words, abiding andcessation) appear, reflects the appearances due to interdependent causation, asin a dream or a magical display—appearances within nonexistence.From the perspective of the absolute lack of essential nature, the meaning ofthe statement is that the ultimate lacks an essential nature. This is theultimate, since it indicates the lack of essence of such formulations asimpurity within that which personifies the ultimate. A Commentary to the CertainIntention states:I stated that all phenomena lack an essential nature with a threefold intention:attributes lack an essential nature, coming-into-being lacks an essentialnature, and the ultimate lacks an essential nature.Third, intention directed toward other times can be illustrated by thestatement, “You will attain enlightenment by just remembering the name BuddhaStainless Moonlight.” Although that alone will not bring enlightenment, based onthat significant preliminary accumulation, you can attain enlightenment atanother time.Fourth, intention directed toward individuals’ attitudes is illustrated by theteaching that disparages ethical conduct and praises generosity, directed towardcertain individuals who hold the view that values ethical conduct above all.The Four Indirect Intentions [b)]Indirect intention comprises indirect intention in respect to entry into theteaching, characteristics,Antidotes, and interpretation.To have another person comprehend the correct path or meaning based on thatindividual’s personal preferences, a teaching can employ some terms or synonymsconsistent with common usage but inconsistent with their true meaning. TheOrnament of the Discourses states:The four indirect intentions—In respect to entry,In respect to attributes,In respect to antidotes,And in respect to interpretation—Are used in relation to the hearers, for the essential nature,To subdue faults,And to express the profound.Thus, four are mentioned. First, indirect intention in respect to entry isemployed for some persons of the lesser way’s hearer propensity who do not enterthe great way due to anxiety concerning the subject of emptiness. For them, itcan be said, “Form exists.” The auditor then enters the great way havingunderstood that form ultimately exists, whereas the speaker’s consideration wasthat appearances exist like appearances in a dream.Second, indirect intention in respect to attributes is illustrated by thestatement, “All phenomena lack an essential nature,” made to fosterunderstanding of the abiding state of the lack of an essential nature. The threeperspectives on the lack of essential nature—conceptual, relational, andabsolute—have been presented above.Third, indirect intention in respect to antidotes is illustrated by the occasionwhen the Buddha understood that a person thought Shakyamuni’s body small, or hislife span short, and so on, and thus inferior to other teachers. He said, “Atthat time, I was the Transcendent Buddha Illuminator.” The person hearing thisunderstood that enlightenment’s form bodies were equal, whereas the speaker’sintention was that he and other buddhas have equal cultivation of goodness andwisdom, attainment of the body of ultimate enlightenment, and service to beings.The Treasury of Observed Phenomena states:All buddhas have equal cultivation of goodness and wisdom,Equal attainment of the body of ultimate enlightenment, and equal activity toserve beings,But not equal life span,Family, or physical size.Fourth, indirect intention in respect to interpretation is illustrated by theexample of statements that are extremely difficult to understand, made tocorrect the fault of those who think, “This teaching is inferior because it’seasy to understand.” For example, The Collection of Sayings states:Who kills his or her father and mother;And destroys the ruler, the two pure ones,And the whole surrounding land—That person becomes purity itself.This statement uses parents as a metaphor for the mental formations of cravingand grasping toward the round of rebirth. “Ruler” is a metaphor for thestorehouse of all dualistic experience, the support or foundation for varioushabitual tendencies. “The two pure ones” is a metaphor for brahmins, whose viewcontends that the collection of impermanent phenomena is a self; and monasticpractitioners, whose view values ethical conduct and discipline above all else.“The whole surrounding land” is a metaphor for the eight bands of consciousness,including the inner sense bases and dualistic clinging. “To destroy them andthus become pure” is used as a metaphor for enlightenment.These cases of intention and indirect intention constitute the second key toviewing the Buddha’s excellent speech. Since there are variouscircumstances—grammar, meaning, intention, and purpose—to be taken intoconsideration for a complete analysis of any specific statement, it is extremelyimportant to know how to analyze discourses and tantras with these analyticmethods.The Treasury of Sacred Doctrine Analyzed [B)]This section has two parts: (1) the two truths and (2) a presentation of thenature of all phenomena as interdependent arising.The Two Truths [1)]This section also has two parts: (1) a presentation of relative truth and (2) apresentation of ultimate truth.Relative Truth [a)]What is analyzed—phenomena—reflects either relative or ultimate truth.Relative truth, the appearing state, is inaccurate or accurate.Inaccurate grasping of inaccurate appearances is misleading relative truth.Correct relative truth does not deviate from the result: it is the wisdom of thepath’s basis.It does not deviate from the attainment of the result, the form bodies ofenlightenment, with their wisdoms.The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight states:The instructions taught by the buddhasAre correctly founded on the two truths—Worldly, relative truth;And sacred, ultimate truth.If what are called “phenomena” are classified only based on their nature, theyhave two categories: the way they appear, relative truth; and the way they are,ultimate truth. Moreover, within the category of the relative way things appear,there are two categories: in delusion and without delusion.First, relative truth in delusion can be defined as follows: While you are anordinary sentient being, the nature of language, concepts, and expression arisesin its totality as appearances within delusion, grasping within delusion, andconsciousness within delusion. Everything within this framework is deceptive,unreal, transitory, and suffering, and appears as the objective domain of adeluded person’s rational dualistic mind. Since it is a framework of language,concepts, and expression, even the Buddha conceived or expressed by sentientbeings’ rational dualistic mind reflects only a construct designated by thatoutlook. Because such experience is not based in the ultimate, it is calleddeluded.In those circumstances, since appearances and awareness can sometimes appear aseither truth or falsehood, the terms “correct relative truth” and “misleadingrelative truth” are used. Correct relative truth has these characteristics:since it corresponds to appearances, it is functional; it has arisen throughcauses; if examined, it dwells apart from true existence; and it is collectivelyperceived. It can be subsumed as earth, water, fire, air, space, and personalindwelling consciousness.Misleading relative truth is not functional, such as an apparition of two moons.The Two Truths states:Although their appearances resemble one another,The distinction between correct And incorrect relative truthIs made according to whether or not they are functional.Second, relative truth without delusion has two parts: The first does notdeviate from the result of the spiritual path—it is the wisdom of the spiritualpath’s foundation, along with its positive qualities. Although progress on thispath is in itself impermanent, it is called “without delusion” since suchprogress leads to the ground of the basic character of being. A Commentary to“The Highest Continuity” states:All truths of the spiritual path are composite;All composite phenomena are deceptive.This statement is made from the perspective of the necessary change and progresson the spiritual path, however such truth is different from other compositephenomena and kinds of deception.The second aspect of relative truth without delusion is attainment withoutdelusion of the spiritual path’s result, enlightenment’s form bodies, with theirwisdoms, that abide in Highest Pure Land. These are without change ortransition, permanent, and ever-present treasures of precious qualities, theentire range of the forms of perfect mastery gained from such prodigiousappearances as sacred circles of wisdom deities. Although from the perspectiveof appearances this is called relative, since it is inseparable from the body ofultimate enlightenment, it remains without change or transition, like space.Enlightenment’s manifest wisdom bodies appear spontaneously in the experience ofbeings to be guided due to their stores of positive karma and due to thebuddhas’ nondual compassion. Nevertheless, although in the outlook of those tobe guided, such manifestations seem to change, ultimately no such changetranspires. The reflection of the image of the moon on water can seem to changedue to conditions within the container, yet that image of the moon has noexistent intrinsic attributes and, for this vital reason, does not change.Likewise, the wisdom bodies that guide beings appear, yet have no existentintrinsic attributes. The three wisdom bodies share the same essence withouthaving been separated from nor joined to it, and the first among these, the bodyof ultimate enlightenment, is without change or transition.Ultimate Truth [b)]Ultimate truth is the true state of the basic character of being,Ultimate truth is the abiding nature of the basic character of being: from thebeginning, all phenomena of the round of rebirth and transcendent states lack anessential nature; they exceed the domain of thought and expression. Realized ornot, that nature cannot be elucidated by the rational dualistic mind and cannotbe affirmed to be either unified or separate. Appearing existence—all the roundof rebirth and transcendent states—can be labeled as separate phenomena withsuch qualities as good or bad, yet everything has the primordial nature ofspace, purity. Thus, this transcends the domains of intellectual categorization,such as “pure, impure, both, neither, or very pure.” The Fundamental Verses onSublime Insight states:Everything is pure, impure,Both pure and impure,Neither pure nor impure: That all such categories are impureIs what the Buddha taught.The outlook of the basic character of being surpasses all philosophical tenets,since within recognition of the essence of being, there is nothing that everexisted. Even if a tenet, such as “It is like this!” were proposed, it wouldfall into the extremes of eternalism or nihilism, such as the view of anexistent self. The Sixty Reasons states:With a tenet that substance exists,One holds a fearful and untenable view,Source of desire and anger,And which leads to dispute.It is said that no fault accrues in not holding a formal tenet in relation tothe basic character of being, as within such a position there is no domain fortenets, no holder of them, nor anything to be grasped. The Refutation of Disputestates:However, when I claim to have some tenetI have that fault,Whereas when I hold no tenet,I am entirely faultless.Therefore, all phenomena are pure in their abiding state or in their naturallypure essence: deep and calm, free from all formulations of philosophical tenets,devoid of premises. This is known as “the originally pure basic space.”To sum up in brief, impure phenomena within delusion are relative truth, likethose in a dream. They are merely untrue, deceptive, experienced by thespiritually immature, beguiling, and disordered, without an essence or graspablefacet. The pure nature of reality is the abiding state of luminouswisdom—profound, peaceful, free from formulations, changeless, ever present—theinconceivable nature of reality.Relative truth provides the context for the cultivation of goodness, accumulatedas in a dream or a magical display. Ultimate truth provides the context for thecultivation of wisdom, meditation on the meaning of the nature of reality, likespace. These two truths and cultivations actualize the results of the spiritualpath, the wisdom bodies that have form and the body of ultimate enlightenment.This concludes instruction that presents the two truths, the first treasury ofthe Buddha’s doctrine.The Nature of All Phenomena as Interdependent Arising [2)]This section has three parts: (1) the interdependent origination of the basiccharacter of being, (2) the interdependent origination of the round of rebirth,and (3) the interdependent origination of transcendence of sorrow.The Interdependent Origination of the Basic Character of Being [a)]Subjective experience, the nature of reality, and the basic character of beingarise interdependently.The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight states:There are no phenomenaThat do not arise through interdependent origination.Thus, there are no phenomenaThat are not empty.The nature of reality, or the nature of appearing phenomena of the round ofrebirth and of transcendent states, has not come from anywhere, does not goanywhere, and does not abide anywhere. Since subjective experience as well isbased in this true nature, even at moments when subjective experience seems toarise or cease, it is free from all extremes that can be formulated concerningarising, abiding, or ceasing—this is the nature of the middle way, so it issaid. The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight states:Whatever has arisen through interdependent originationIs said to be empty.Teachings based on that factConstitute the path of the middle way.Therefore, all facets of impure appearances and the consciousness that graspsthem are like strands of hair that seem to appear to the blurred vision of thosewho have a phlegm ailment: from that very moment of their appearance, they donot exist. Like a dream’s deluded perceptions that do not exist while fallingasleep or while waking up, but only in between, the present deluded perceptionexperienced by the six kinds of beings does not exist in the original nature ofmind’s innate constituent enlightenment, a primordially pure essence; nor dothey exist at the moment of the original total purification of delusion,enlightenment. However, in this state in between, these appearances arenonexistent apparitions; their coming-into-being, abiding, and cessation do notexist. Therefore, since the essence of the nature of realty has neithercoming-into-being nor destruction, from the past to the present, and into thefuture, it does not change. “Deluded perception” is nothing but a name or alabel, like “flowers in space” or “a barren woman’s child”—such perceptions donot exist in the basic character of being and once you realize their nature, yougain liberation.Any and all phenomena at any time arise interdependently—they do not come intobeing, cease, come, or go; they are not single, separate, finite, or permanent.Realize phenomena as having the nature of the complete pacification of allformulation. The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight states:Whoever expresses the doctrine of peace,Interdependent origination—Unceasing, not coming into being,Not finite, not permanent,Not coming, not going,Not single, not separate,The total pacification of formulationAs taught by the perfect Buddha—To that holy one, I pay homage.In brief, the primordial purity of the nature of all phenomena is what is called“the interdependent origination of the basic character of being,” or “theinterdependent origination of the ground of being.”The Interdependent Origination of the Round of Rebirth [b)]The outer and inner phenomena of the round of rebirth arise interdependently.The outer semblance of appearances appears in the domain of the mind with theforms of mountains, walls, earth, water, fire, air, and space. We can alsoconsider the example of what are known as creations of the elements or elements’forms: such things as cotton, the manufacture of threads, weaving, and coarsecloth are material appearances created in similar or dissimilar forms throughthe interplay of causes and conditions. All such coming into being is called“outer interdependent origination,” since produced substances arise based on oneanother and because they appear outwardly as inert form.The arising in the cycle of the twelve links of causation from ignorance toformations, and so on until aging and death, is referred to as innerinterdependent origination. The Journey to Langka Discourse states:Akshayamati! A pot emerges from lumps of clay, a blanket from thick threads,coarse cloth from thread, sprouts from seeds, and butter from milk and humaneffort, such as churning. Likewise, Akshayamati, in outer interdependentorigination, a latter event arises from a former one. Inner interdependentorigination is as follows: The production of these phenomena and others fromignorance and craving are what is given the name “inner interdependentorigination.”Among the twelve links of interdependent origination (or “causation”), the firstis ignorance, to not know correctly the abiding nature—the primordially purenature of reality, the essence of the basic character of being—and the phenomenathat represent it. This ignorance starts the chain of the cause and effect ofthe round of rebirth; thus it is related to formations. Further, formations arethree kinds of acts, by the body, voice, and mind obscured byignorance—ennobling acts consistent with goodness, the ten corrupting acts, andacts of neutral value. Ennobling acts lead to higher realms; corrupting acts tomiserable existences; neutral acts, which have traits similar to corruptingacts, accompany them both.Consciousness is the knowing aspect of mind that develops within any kind ofsentient being into which a being’s formative karma has entered, whose appearingaspect corresponds to those acts. When consciousness entered that new life as abeing, it entered at the conjoining of the parents’ white and red essences, andthe being’s energy and mind. Together they create the four name-basedpsychophysical aggregations—sensation, perception, formative factors, andconsciousness. Form arises from the creation of the aggregation of form.Together, these five are called “name and form.” Further, name and form arecreated when consciousness enters the mother’s womb.Form gradually develops in embryonic stages (such as the mer-mer period) to acomplete body. During that period, the six sense bases arise—eyes, ears, nose,tongue, body, and mental faculty. From the meeting of sense objects, senses, andmental activity, contact arises. For example, just as contact arises when form,the eyes’ senses, and visual consciousness meet at the eyes, three things—name,form, and consciousness—in the mother’s womb create contact; and contact,sensation. From contact with pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral objects,sensations of pleasure, pain, or indifference arise.Sensation induces craving: sensation of the sweet taste of sugar induces cravingfor the pleasure of its delicious taste; unpleasant sensations create the desireto avoid them and create the craving for pleasure; neutral sensations createcraving in equanimity. Craving has four aspects: concordant, discordant,neutral, and appropriation to yourself—grasping. Grasping leads to existence:the five psychophysical aggregations—form, sensation, perception, formativefactors, and consciousness—arise. These aggregations are existence and give riseto it. In existence, taking birth comes first and, in the future, rebirth. Birthleads to youth, aging, and the cessation of life, death.From the perspective that among these links of causation the former leads to thelatter, they are called “arising from causes.” From the perspective ofdevelopment of the collection of the six elements—inner earth, water, fire, air,space, and consciousness—they are called “arising from inner conditions.” Thisexplanation has been given from the perspective of the great way.The Links of Interdependent Origination according to the Hearers’ WayAccording to the hearers’ way, the links of interdependent origination areexplained as follows: Ignorance is the psychophysical aggregations that arisedue to the previous life’s engagement in the mental afflictions. Formations arethe five aggregations due to the previous lifetime’s accumulation of karma.Consciousness is the five aggregations at the moment of the ensuing entry intothe womb. Name and form are the five aggregations during the embryonic stages,such as the mer-mer period, until the five sense organs protrude on the embryo’sbody. The six senses are the stage between the time the sense organs form andthe time they can experience sense objects. Contact is the five aggregationsfrom the time sensorial awareness functions until pleasure and pain aredistinguished. Sensation is the five aggregations from the time pleasure andpain are distinguished until you are capable of sexual intercourse. Craving isthe five aggregations from the time you are capable of sexual intercourse untilyou strive for the object of your desire. Grasping is the five aggregations atthe time that object is striven for. Existence is the five aggregations whenkarma is accumulated. Birth is the five aggregations when the next life beginswith the exit from a mother’s womb. Aging and death are four stages—name andform, grasping, craving, and sensation—related to that new life.Completion of the Twelve LinksThese twelve links of interdependent origination are completed in two ways:instantaneously and continually. From the perspective of instantaneouscompletion, the following example can be used: at the time of killing based onyourself and another, ignorance is to perform that act of wrongdoing due to lackof knowledge of the time of death. Formation is to begin the act based on thatignorance. Consciousness is your dualistic awareness during the act. You and theother being possess name and form and the six senses. Contact is to strike theother with a weapon, to produce your own happiness and the other’s suffering.The happiness and suffering that then arise constitute sensation. Craving is toextend the duration of your enjoyment beyond the completion of the act. Graspingis to engage with the next sensation that arises. Existence is the fiveaggregations at that point. Birth is the present and future that arise from it.The aging and death of those aspects constitute the completion of the action.Thus all twelve links are complete in one instant.There are three instants: the culminant instant, when consciousness clearlyapprehends an object; an instant made up of one hundred and twenty moments ofsuch a consciousness; and the instant of the completion of an act, the time fromthe act’s beginning until its completion.Second, from the perspective of their continual completion, the twelve links ofinterdependent origination are explained as follows: Those of the mind onlyschool believe that one cycle of cause and effect is completed over twolifetimes. During the past life, six causes are completed, after which duringthis lifetime six results arise. This process continues to the next life, and soon. The six causes are ignorance, formations, consciousness, craving, grasping,and existence. Their six results are the remaining six of the twelve.According to the hearers, one cycle of cause and effect is completed over threelifetimes: Based on the causes of ignorance and formations during the past life,the results of the next five links—consciousness and the others—arise duringthis life. Craving, grasping, and existence during this life produce, throughcause and effect, the two results of birth, and aging and death, in a futurelife.The Interdependent Origination of the Transcendence of Sorrow [c)]To guide beings, the buddhas demonstrated the interdependent origination of thetranscendence of sorrow.This section has two parts: the spiritual path and the result. In relation tothe path, ignorance is the source of the twelve links of interdependentorigination that unfold in sequence to produce the round of rebirth. The wisdomof awareness counteracts ignorance. Once your stream of being has becomefamiliar with sublime insight born from hearing the teachings, reflection, andmeditation, this counteracts the primal source, ignorance. Based on thisreversal of ignorance, the other links based on it are gradually reversed. Oncethe cause of entering existence is thus exhausted, you pass beyond the confinesof the round of rebirth. The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight states:If ignorance ceases,Formations will not arise.To make ignorance cease,Meditate on the nature of reality with this knowledge.If a link of causation ceases,It will not manifest.That which is only a heap of miseryWill thus completely cease.Practitioners who yearn for freedom do not accumulate acts and karma that createthe round of rebirth. By not so accumulating those acts and causes, the resultis that they will no longer be reborn within the round of rebirth, sinceformations cease.Second, the result of the Buddhist path is enlightenment and service forsentient beings, performed as in a dream or a magical display.Thus, know that all phenomena can be synthesized within interdependentorigination. Once you thus gain comprehension of the sacred meaning of thistruth, you will transcend suffering. The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insightstates:Those who see interdependent originationSee the truth of suffering, origination,Cessation,And the path.This concludes instruction that presents the second treasury of the Buddha’ssupreme excellent speech, since all instructions are gathered within it. Amongsubjects to understand, these instructions are extremely precious.Sublime Insight Gained from Reflection [ii]To accept and nurture fortunate disciples, reflect upon the words and meaningstaught.Examine the scripture and reasoning used in debate to stem misleading beliefsystems.Examine your experience in reading the composition of extensive or brief clearand profound texts.Use thorough analysis to arrive at certainty in any subject.To be able to accept and nurture fortunate disciples, reflect assiduously uponeach word and meaning taught in any text until they become easy for you tounderstand. Become acutely accomplished in the scripture and reasoning used indebates to stem challenges based upon misleading belief systems. Examine purelyevery form of challenge and thus become free of any anxiety in relation to yourunderstanding. In relation to written composition, whatever its form—themagnificent linguistic form of an extensive presentation or a briefsummary—repeatedly examine and do not discard from your mind their depth andutter clarity, and your experience of them based on such facets as theirsubject, body, or literary embellishments. If you consistently do so and learnfrom their examples, you will surely be able to succeed at any project youconsider, be it spiritual or secular. The Wish-Fulfilling Treasury states:After having become adorned with sacred hearing of the teachings,Definitely develop the sublime insight gained from reflection.Sublime Insight Gained from Meditation [iii]This section has eight parts: (1) like a dream, (2) like a magical display, (3)like an optical illusion, (4) like a mirage, (5) like the reflection of the moonon water, (6) like an echo, (7) like a city of spirits, and (8) like anemanation.Like a Dream [A)]As in a dream, phenomena have not come into being:In the sleep of ignorance, dreams of deluded perceptions arise.Without clinging to the myriad objects, subjects, and collections of thoughtsthat appear,Meditate that they are like dreams.Like the appearances in a dream, all phenomena of the round of rebirth andtranscendent states have never come into being. Oppressed by the sleep ofignorance, the six kinds of beings, in the dreams of their deluded perceptions,experience the arising of myriad forms of happiness or suffering. TheMiddle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! All phenomena are like dreams or a magical display. The transcendenceof sorrow is also like a dream or a magical display. If there are any phenomenasuperior to the transcendence of sorrow, they too are like a dream or a magicaldisplay.The Discourse of the Wise and the Foolish states:Beings are like a dream;Likewise, karma is like a dream;Those who undertake actsAre all like a dream.The Discourse Requested by Achintyaprabhasa states:At any time, all myriad phenomenaHave, in their nature, never come into being.Like an immaterial dream,They are insubstantial.Therefore, what you experience as outer (synthesized as the objects of the fivesenses, including mountains, valleys, towns, and sentient beings) and as inner(your body, senses, sensorial consciousnesses, and discursive recollection andawareness) are all the appearances of dreams. Like dreams, apart from theirappearance, they at no point exist; they are not real. Think this from thebottom of your heart and meditate on this without a moment’s distraction.Wherever you go, wherever you stay, whoever your companions are, whatever youeat, whatever you say, whatever thoughts arise, whatever you do, whateverappearances arise, think at that very moment, “This is really a dream; theessence of a dream is unreal.” Meditate until even in dreams all phenomena ariseas a dream. The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:Even in dream, to see all phenomenaAs a dreamIs a sign of arriving at the peak.The Ornament of the Appearance of Wisdom Discourse states:Manjushri! In dreams, appearances do not exist. Likewise, all phenomena appearbut do not exist.A discourse states:Even the source of ennobling qualities is like a dream or like a magicaldisplay. Even awakening’s thirty-seven facets are like a dream or a magicaldisplay. Even the wisdom of complete omniscience is like a dream or a magicaldisplay.Like a Magical Display [B)]As in a magical display, phenomena do not cease.There are four modes of magic—natural magic,Impure magic, skillful magic, and wisdom magic.Meditate having reached definite understanding through the examples of magic.As in a magical display, all phenomena are naturally unceasing. To purify thedeluded perceptions of dualistic experience—the six kinds of beings’ solidifiedattachment to the reality of their magical cities—you must know the four modesof magic. First, natural magic is the basic space of the basis ofpurification—buddha nature itself. At the time of experience of yourself as asentient being, this is the experience of your innate constituent enlightenmentas impure; at the time of experience of yourself as a bodhisattva, theexperience of it as impure and pure; and at the time of enlightenment, theexperience of it as very pure. Thus three designations are given to thisconstituent, yet in its essence there is no change, either positive or negative.The Pinnacle of Jewels Discourse states:Kashyapa! That naturally pure basic space is neither the round of rebirth nor isit transcendence, since it is insubstantial.Second, impure magic refers to the stains to be purified. These are the round ofrebirth’s deluded perceptions that arise in the forms of beings and theirworlds; and as the results—various forms of suffering—of deluded thought, karma,and mental afflictions.Third, skillful magic that purifies refers to the remedial path, the completionof the twofold cultivation on four spiritual paths of attainment—three stages ofthe path of cultivation (higher, middle, and lesser), four stages of the path ofapplication, the path of seeing, and the path of meditation.Fourth, ultimate wisdom magic refers to the culminant path of no furthertraining, the attainment of the victors’ three wisdom bodies endowed withenlightenment’s five wisdoms and spontaneous enlightened activity.In the metaphor of magic, horses, oxen, and so on appear from the primary causeof the basis of delusion—wood and stones—transformed by a secondary cause,awareness mantras that obscure the visual consciousness of onlookers.34[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st34] The deluded perceptions, the forms of horses oroxen seen, arise self-manifest from a collection of interdependent conditions.This resembles deluded perceptions within the round of rebirth. The SovereignMeditative State Discourse states:In the midst of many persons,A magician manifests forms—Horses, oxen, carts, and various birds—Which, although unreal, appear in various ways:Likewise, know all phenomena to be like that!The Discourse Requested by the Good Magician states:Karma’s magical emanationIs the six kinds of beings.The magical emanation of conditionsIs a reflection in a mirror and other examples.The magical emanation of BuddhismIs the circle of monks around me.I am perfect magic,The noncomposite body of ultimate enlightenment.Meditation that whatever you see or hear, and all you recall or think, is aself-manifest magical display constitutes a state without discursive thought.All appearances of anger or desire, friends or foes, happiness or suffering,outer objective appearances or inner subjective perceptions arise fromconditions and are therefore magical. They are unreal and deceptive, thusmagical. They appear without existing, thus magical. Thinking this, know magicto be the natural radiance of emptiness. The Middle-Length Version of the Motherof Sublime Insight states:All phenomena are like a magical display: they naturally do not come into being,they are unceasing, and they do not draw near.The Irreversible Wheel Discourse states:All phenomena are like a magical display;Even awakening is like a magical display.Like an Optical Illusion [C)]As in an optical illusion, phenomena do not draw near.As in an optical illusion, form, sound, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, andphenomenaAre completely devoid of reality.Develop skill in this and settle free from discursive thought or recollection.All phenomena—the six sensory objects, such as form; the six sensory organs,such as the eyes; the six collections of consciousness, such as visualconsciousness; and labeled appearances—are like an optical illusion, withoutreality. Within that ongoing state, settle without discursive thought orrecollection. A discourse states:Any mental activity is a corrupting act; lack of mental activity is an ennoblingact. When nothing is recollected and you bring nothing to mind, this is therecollection of enlightenment.The Ornament of the Appearance of Wisdom Discourse states:Manjushri! In an optical illusion, appearances lack an intrinsic nature.Likewise, all phenomena appear but lack an intrinsic nature.The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:The essence of the optical illusion of all phenomena lacks an intrinsic nature;from the start, phenomena are essentially empty.The same text states:Subhuti! As in an optical illusion, all phenomena naturally do not draw near.Like a Mirage [D)]As in a mirage, phenomena do not go:They don’t arise, cease, or remain, like a mirage.Regard joy or pain, affirmation or denial, and dualistic clinging to be like amirage.Settle free from hope or fear, and from the mind’s outward or inward movement.At the very moment various forms appear, their essence does not exist. Thisapplies to all that seems to come into being, such as worlds forming in theouter universe; flowers and other growing things; and sentient beings and alltheir discursive thoughts. From the very moment they appear to come into being,they do not. The domain of their coming into being and the awareness in whichthey appear to have come into being are in essence nonexistent.Thus, likewise, at the very moment that things appear to abide, vividly andsolidly existent, that which abides and the experiencer of that abiding do notexist. At the very moment when worlds seem to be destroyed and become empty, orwhen sentient beings seem to leave their mass of discursive thought (i.e., whenthey die), there is neither cessation nor going. Know that appearances have nointrinsic nature, like water seen in a mirage. The Ornament of the Appearance ofWisdom Discourse states:Manjushri! A mirage is an appearance devoid of an intrinsic nature. Likewise,all phenomena are appearances that lack an intrinsic nature.The Sovereign Meditative State Discourse states:Just as in the half-light of evening,Travelers parched with thirstSee a body of water in a mirage,Know all phenomena to be like that!The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! As in a mirage, all phenomena primordially do not go.With the thought, “These appearances are a mirage; they have no intrinsic natureat all,” do not let the mind move outward in interest or turn inward withinone-pointed self-absorption. Relax within your ongoing state and repeatedlysustain recognition of the natural radiance of awareness.Like the Reflection of the Moon on Water [E)]Like the reflection of the moon on water, phenomena are free from nonexistence:While they appear, they are empty; while they are empty, they appear.Know all clinging to the reality of phenomena—appearances, sound, thought,clinging, existence, nonexistence—To be just the empty appearance of a reflection.The image of the moon on water has no substantiality nor characteristics thatare proper to itself. It transcends any extreme of existence or nonexistence,yet it appears unimpededly to the eyes. Likewise, this pure nature of mind hasneither substantiality nor attributes, and it transcends any extreme formulationof being or nonbeing. All forms that appear, sounds that reverberate, andthoughts and recollection that gather or disperse are like the moon on water,appearances without an existent intrinsic nature. Settle in evenness within themeaning of this. The Sovereign Meditative State Discourse states:At night, images of the moon naturally appearOn the surface of untroubled water.That reflection is an empty collection of conditions: it has no core.Likewise, know all phenomena to be like this.The Ornament of the Appearance of Wisdom Discourse states:Manjushri! The reflection of the moon on water is an appearance devoid of anintrinsic nature. Likewise, all phenomena are appearances without an intrinsicnature.The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! Like the reflection of the moon on water, all phenomena appear yet donot subsequently end.Like an Echo [F)]As in an echo, phenomena are free of permanence:All sounds, of praise or of blame, pleasant or unpleasant,Have neither basis nor source, and not the slightest intrinsicnature.Meditate that whatever appears is like an echo.All phenomena, like an echo, have no permanence. The melody of an echo can haveseeming existence due to conditions, although there is nothing whatsoeverbetween a cliff and a person hearing the echo. Likewise, you can examine indetail coarse outer objective phenomena and inner recollection and thought: youcan try to examine an identifiable essence, shape, or color in subtle phenomena,yet you will not find any, not even the slightest. They are like space,ineffable and inconceivable.All sounds, of praise or of blame, pleasant or unpleasant, have no basis orsource, and not the least intrinsic nature. Meditate that whatever appears islike an echo. The Pinnacle of Jewels Discourse states:Kashyapa! Any bodhisattva who realizes that all phenomena are like an echoattains forbearance related to sound. That is to say, those who do not takepleasure in their own sound, have no aversion to others’ sounds, and have nofright toward hearing the sound of instructions on emptiness have attained thefirst forbearance related to sound.The Sovereign Meditative State Discourse states:People sitting in front of cliffsSing, talk, laugh, and cry,Creating the conditions for echoes to arise,Yet the sounds of their echoes never move from the melody of the sounds thatcreate them.Likewise, know all phenomena to be like that.The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! All phenomena, like an echo, naturally do not last.Like a City of Spirits [G)]As in an ephemeral city of spirits, phenomena are not multiple.From the moment such a city appears on the plain at twilight, it has nointrinsic nature.Likewise, delusion’s perceptions within the round of rebirth are unreal.Familiarize yourself with the meaning of that.As in an ephemeral city of spirits, all phenomena are not separate from oneanother: on a plain at twilight, a city filled with people appears but from themoment they are seen, the city and the people within it do not exist. Althoughbeings appear based on that environment, from the moment they appear, they lackan intrinsic nature. Since apart from the mind’s deluded perceptions,appearances do not in fact exist, they are liberated, since the mind has nointrinsic nature. Since the nature of deluded perceptions is empty, there is noneed to deliberately renounce those perceptions. Settle without effort insupreme evenness. The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insightstates:Subhuti! Since all phenomena do not abide, have no foundation, and naturallyhave not come into being, they are like an ephemeral city of spirits.A discourse states:Composite phenomena are like an ephemeral city of spirits.The Ornament of the Appearance of Wisdom Discourse states:Manjushri! An ephemeral city of spirits appears without having any existence.Likewise, all phenomena appear without existing.The Journey to Langka Discourse states:These three planes of existence are like an ephemeral city of spiritsOr a body of water in a mirage:Know the sight of them to be mistaken and settle without discursive thought.Like an Emanation [H)]As in an emanation, phenomena are not singular:Meditate that what arises—the environment, beings, karma,Mental afflictions, suffering, the stages and paths of awakening, and anyappearance—Has in itself no inherent existence.As in an emanation, all phenomena are not singular: from the moment of theirappearance, they are empty and transcend the extremes of existence ornonexistence. Thus all appearances—the totality of worlds and beings that aresynthesized into the five elements, karma, mental afflictions, suffering, aswell as awakening’s paths and stages—have in themselves not an iota’s worth ofinherent existence. Therefore, settle in evenness without grasping on to them.The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:Subhuti! Since all phenomena are not dual, nor singular, they are like anemanation.The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eighty Thousand Stanzas states:Child of the gods! Since all phenomena neither draw near nor go, they are likean emanation.The Ornament of the Appearance of Wisdom Discourse states:Manjushri! An emanation has an appearance without it existing.Likewise, all phenomena have an appearance without existing.Further, to achieve the positive qualities of the Buddhist path, it is notsufficient to think of doing something or to know something. You must meditate.The faults of not meditating are stated in The Flower Ornament Discourse:Not meditating on the instructionsIs like a skilled boatmanWho frees many persons,But drowns.Not meditating on the instructionsIs like a deaf musicianWho delights many persons,But cannot hear.Not meditating on the instructionsIs like thirsty personsWho see or hear water,Yet do nothing to relieve their thirst.As described, there are three kinds of sublime insight. The essence of sublimeinsight is the realization of what must be known. The primary cause of sublimeinsight is based on meditative states. Its result is liberation from mentalafflictions. Its function is the eradication of doubt through a pure lifestyleand correct spiritual instruction. Its quality is that it has you reach the cityof freedom. Its categories are threefold: sublime insight gained through hearingthe teachings, reflection, and meditation, or sublime insight gained through theintroduction, main practice, and conclusion of meditative states.Those endowed with sublime insight will quickly reach liberation. The ExaltedDiscourse That Presents the Design of Armor states:Those who completely accomplish with supreme application and diligence thisinstruction of no coming-into-being, no ceasing, and very profound emptinesswill rapidly become skilled in the basic space of phenomena of the bodhisattvas.They will gain excellent memory and confidence, will attain the completecollection of the unsurpassable instructions, will be praised by the honoredbuddhas, and will dwell in pure ethical conduct. They will attain pure patience,unsurpassable diligence, nonreferential meditative stability, and supremesublime insight, and will quickly reach manifest complete enlightenment. Oncethey sit at Heart of Awakening (that is, Bodhgaya), the four great divine kingswill raise a parasol and request from them the turning of the wheel of thedoctrine. In great illumination manifest for gods and humanity, they will fullyplace those beings in unsurpassable awakening.THE THIRTY-SEVEN FACETS AND TEN STAGES OF AWAKENING ON THE FOUR PATHS OFTRAINING [III] [05_toc-title.html#sec-36]This chapter has four parts: (1) the path of cultivation, (2) the path ofapplication, (3) the path of seeing, and (4) the path of meditation.The Path of Cultivation [A]On the subject of meditation, the path of cultivation includes the support,nature,Cause, result, and four points to describe the essence—Characteristics, example, classification, and special attributes.The duration of the path can be thirty-three, seven, or three incalculable eons.The special attributes are antidotes, renunciation, realization,Qualities, and meditation, both general and specific.On the lesser path of cultivation you meditate on the four recollections—Recollection of body, sensation, mind, and phenomena.On the middle path of cultivation, you meditate on the four genuinerenunciations—To not develop corrupting qualities that have not yet arisen, to stem thosewhich have,To develop ennobling qualities that have not yet arisen, to increase those whichhave.On the higher path of cultivation, you meditate on the four supports formiraculous powers—The supports of the meditative states of aspiration, diligence, mind, andconduct.This section has two parts: the support for the path of cultivation and thenature of that path. The support for the path of cultivation refers to thephysical body of anyone who has first uplifted their mind to awakening in thegreat way. The lesser path of cultivation can be entered after that initialuplift of the mind to awakening.Second, the nature of the path of cultivation has three aspects: cause, result,and essence. Of these, the cause of the path of cultivation is the naturallyexistent enlightened heritage, awakened by hearing the teachings of the greatway and reflection upon them. The path of cultivation leads to four results: thethree paths of application, seeing, and meditation; and the path of no furthertraining.A description of the essence of the path of cultivation has four points: itsdefining characteristic, example, levels, and special attributes. First, thepath of cultivation’s characteristic is the ennobling act of remaininginseparable with the great way’s uplift of the mind to awakening from the timeyou enter the great way until the arising of the heat stage of the great way’spath of application. That example can be appropriately designated as the greatway path of cultivation. Among the ennobling acts that cause attainment ofenlightenment, this path involves beginners’ collection of acts that induce thearising in their conscious stream of being of the first instant of the distinctphases of the path of application that border the path of seeing, such as thegreat way’s heat stage of the path of application.Second, the example of the path of cultivation is any act performed after theinitial entry into the great way until the path of application arises, when suchacts are motivated by the desire for complete awakening. Acts that can inducethe arising of the path of application include ethical conduct; control of thesenses; conscientious eating of food in proper measure; diligence incontemplative practice during the first and last parts of the day, instead ofsleeping; joyful mindful living within the bounds of correct conduct; to notregret ennobling acts; enthusiasm, faith, devotion, and other ennobling actsthat lead to freedom; and sublime insight gained from hearing teachings,reflection, and meditation.Third, the path of cultivation has three levels: the lesser path of cultivation,the middle path of cultivation, and the higher path of cultivation.The lesser path marks the beginning to the three incalculable eons of spiritualpractice, which cause the attainment of enlightenment. The lesser path is theperiod of meditation on the four forms of mindfulness; on this level of thepath, the time the path of application will arise is indefinite. The middle pathis the period of meditation on the four genuine renunciations; the time the pathof application will arise is definite—during or after the next lifetime. Thehigher path is the period of meditation on the four supports for miraculouspowers; the time the path of application will arise is definite—in that samelifetime.The path of cultivation’s duration depends upon the uplift of the mind toawakening: “The inspiration of the very eager bodhisattva” refers to the wish tofirst attain enlightenment, then to later liberate beings, similar to the wishto gain the dominion of a ruler, and then to bring happiness to your subjects. Anumber of discourses call this “the inspiration like the exalted BodhisattvaLoving Kindness.” For such bodhisattvas of an inferior degree of acumen, theattainment of enlightenment requires thirty-three incalculable eons—three eonsfor the paths of cultivation and application; and three each for each ofawakening’s ten stages.The wish to become liberated at the same time as beings is called “theinspiration of sacred wisdom.” This can be likened to the wish of a ferryboatcaptain to cross a river together with passengers. For these bodhisattvas ofmiddle degree of spiritual acumen, enlightenment requires seven incalculableeons—two for each of the paths of cultivation and application, one for the pathof seeing, and two for the path of meditation.The wish to liberate sentient beings first, before your own primordialself-liberation, is known as “the incomparable inspiration.” This attitude, likethat of shepherds of goats, sheep, or cattle, who watch for dangerous places,such as ravines, and who allow other beings to precede them as they go, withoutletting any fall behind, is uplift of the mind to awakening like that ofBodhisattva Gentle Splendor and Buddha Shakyamuni. For such bodhisattvas of anacute degree of acumen, enlightenment requires three incalculable eons. TheMajor Commentary to “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight ThousandStanzas” states:The first incalculable eon begins at the path of cultivation and is completed atawakening’s first stage. The second extends from Immaculate (the second stage)until the seventh stage. The third extends from Unmoving (the eighth stage)until the stage of enlightenment.However, once bodhisattvas reach the path of seeing, they can accomplishawakening in seven days if they so wish. The Perfection of Sublime Insight inTwenty-Five Thousand Stanzas states:If they so wish, great bodhisattvas who have gained pure spiritual eyes to seeall phenomena can attain in seven days the manifest, complete enlightenment ofunsurpassable awakening.Fourth, the path of cultivation has five special attributes: antidote,renunciation, realization, positive qualities, and meditation instructions. Thespecial antidote, that of revulsion, develops from sight of the shortcomings ofcontaminated composite formations. The special renunciation, that of manifestattachment, develops from sight of the faults of contaminated compositeformations. The special realization develops from the sublime insight gainedfrom hearing of and reflection upon the two aspects of the nonexistence of aself: this mainly results from an abstract understanding, although at this stagerealization can also be produced by meditation. The Compendium of Trainingstates:It is also possible for there to be sublime insight gained from meditation.Once the mind becomes proficient on this path, its special positive qualitiesinclude reaching the path of awakening and the ability of the intellect to restin meditative states of tranquility and insight. It is said that these positivequalities lead to such attainments as spiritual sight and clairvoyance, and tohearing profound instruction from the manifest body of Buddha.The special meditation instructions of the path of cultivation have two parts,general and specific. First, general meditations for all three levels of thepath of cultivation include ethical conduct, focused on physical and verbal actsto be undertaken or abjured; sublime insight gained in hearing the meaning ofthe words of the Buddha’s supreme speech, and reflection and meditation upon it;the four seals of the doctrine; the five powers concordant with freedom; andrecollection of the Buddha, the doctrine, the spiritual community, ethicalconduct, giving, the body, death, birth, and the inward and outward movement ofthe breath.Meditation on the four seals that characterize the doctrine is explained asfollows: Once you uplift your mind to awakening, you meditate on theimpermanence of all composite phenomena, the sufferings of the round of rebirththat have the nature of contamination, the absence of an identity in allphenomena, and the peace of transcendence of sorrow. These meditations areconcluded with a dedication of the goodness of the act of meditation.The five powers concordant with freedom are exceptional faith, diligence,mindfulness, meditative states, and sublime insight. However, at this stage, thetrue essence of these five does not arise. Likewise, the general meditationsalso include meditation on recollection of death and impermanence as the natureof life; on the nine perceptions of the body’s impurity, eight thoughts of greatpersons, and completely pure conduct.The nine perceptions of impurity are meditations on the perception of a corpse’sinert form, its destruction by insects, its red color, blue color, black color,consumption by animals, scattering, burning, and rotting.The eight thoughts of great persons are as follows: At some time, may I have thecapability to relieve sentient beings’ sufferings! At some time, may I be ableto give great wealth to those beings threatened by poverty! At some time, may Ihave the ability to serve sentient beings with my body’s flesh and blood! Atsome time, may I serve sentient beings even though to do so I must long remainin hell! At some time, may I be able to fulfill sentient beings’ wishes withgreat mundane and spiritual wealth! At some time, when I have reachedenlightenment, may I surely separate sentient beings from their suffering! Inall my lifetimes, may I never wish to not help sentient beings; may I not wishto only enjoy the flavor of the ultimate; may I not say words that do notsatisfy all persons; may I not have a livelihood, a body, knowledge, wealth, orpower that are not helpful to others; and may I not enjoy acts that harm others!May the results of sentient beings’ wrongdoing ripen in me and may the resultsof my ennobling acts ripen in them!This explanation has been taken from commentaries to the source texts.Completely pure conduct is as stated in The Ornament of the Discourses:When the Victor’s heirs act in any way,They speak suitable words that relate to sentient beings’ myriad sensoryperceptionsExactly as they areAnd thus actualize sentient beings’ welfare.Cultivate your experience in the meaning of what has been explained above.Second, specific meditation instructions have three parts. On the lesser path ofcultivation, you meditate on the four recollections. That is, duringrecollection of the body, in periods of settling in evenness, you meditate onthe body like space; and in your postmeditative state, on the body as impure, orlike a magical display, and so on. During recollection of sensation, in periodsof settling in evenness, you meditate on sensation as not coming into being; andin your postmeditative state, on any sensation as suffering and without a solidcore, like a plantain plant. During recollection of mind, in periods of settlingin evenness, you meditate on the mind as intrinsically empty; and in yourpostmeditative state, as unceasing and not abiding. During recollection ofphenomena, in periods of settling in evenness, you meditate on their equanimity;and in your postmeditative state, on the eight metaphors for illusion, and soon.On the lesser path of cultivation, meditation on these four recollections leadsto entering the path’s four truths. With knowledge of the body as sufferingthrough the first recollection, you enter knowledge of suffering. With knowledgeof sensation of suffering through the second recollection, you enterrenunciation of the source of suffering. Through meditation on the impermanenceof mind, grasping on to permanence ceases and you enter manifest cessation.Through meditation on the nonexistence of an autonomous identity withinphenomena, you turn from attachment to a self and enter meditation on the path.Second, on the middle path of cultivation, you meditate on the four genuinerenunciations: to not develop corrupting qualities that have not yet arisen, tostem those that have, to develop ennobling qualities that have not yet arisen,and to increase those that have. These are effected by diligence and meditationon such antidotes as the nonexistence of an intrinsic self, illusion, or dream.Third, on the higher path of cultivation, you meditate on the four supports formiraculous power. Through meditation on single-minded meditative states thatintegrate tranquility and insight, you accomplish your desired goals, such asspiritual sight, clairvoyance, and miraculous powers. In this case, sincemiraculous powers and so on are accomplished through the strength of your mind’spliability gained in meditative stability, these meditative states—intent,diligence, mind, and examination—are called the four supports for miraculouspowers. In these meditations, you first gather your attention on a single focusand rest in clarity. At that time, if discursive thoughts appear, youimmediately prevent their spread, and gather your attention single-mindedly onthe support that provides a focus for the meditation. You meditate repeatedly inthis manner.The Path of Application [B]The explanation of the path of application describes its support and nature.Its nature has cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics,definition,And a classification—heat, peak, forbearance, and supreme qualities—and specialattributes.You meditate on heat and peak with the five powers—Faith, diligence, mindfulness, meditative states, and sublime insight.You meditate on forbearance and supreme qualities with the five forces.The path of application’s special attributes are its antidotes, renunciation,Realization, qualities, and superiority when compared to the path ofcultivation.The explanation of the path of application has two parts: the path ofapplication’s support and its nature. The support (that is, the kind of beingwho can enter this path) can be either a physical support—any being of the fiverealms—or a mental support—any being of the six states of meditative stabilityin the heavens.The nature of the path of application has three parts: its cause, result, andessence. The path of application’s cause is the great way path of cultivation;its three results are the paths of seeing, meditation, and no further training.The path of application’s essence has four parts: characteristic, example,levels, and special attributes.The path of application’s characteristic is ennobling acts that belong to thegreat way performed after completion of the path of cultivation and until thepath of seeing.The path of application’s example that can be appropriately designated as thegreat way path of application is any act belonging to the great way, done aftercompletion of the path of cultivation, that causes the first instant of the pathof seeing to arise in an individual’s conscious stream of being.The path of application has four levels: heat, peak, forbearance, and sublimequalities. At the levels of heat and peak, you meditate on the five powers; atthe levels of forbearance and sublime qualities, on the five forces. The fivepowers are faith, diligence, mindfulness, meditative states, and sublimeinsight.You meditate on them as follows: after having uplifted the mind to awakening,you meditate with faithful trust on the meaning of the four truths (impermanenceand so on) or on the knowledge that all phenomena of the round of rebirth andtranscendent states constitute the two truths. You meditate with the enthusiasmof diligence; mindfully not forgetting your understanding; single-minded inmeditative states; and with comprehension of the intrinsic nature of realitythrough sublime insight. Since these five produce complete awakening, they arecalled powers.The five forces are the force of faith, and so on, meditated upon in the samefashion as the powers. Since they overcome influences detrimental to awakening,they are called forces. The Ornament of the Discourses states:Since they weaken detrimental influences,They are called “forces.”The essence of wisdom on the path of application’s four levels is, duringsettling in evenness, nonconceptual wisdom. Upon arising from this, yourpostmeditative state can be conceptual or not, as appropriate. However, is whatis called “the support endowed with four concepts” conceptual or not? If beingendowed with concepts means becoming conceptual, persons wearing hats wouldbecome their hats, as they could be said to be endowed with them. Further, thefour concepts are called “the support for this path” rather than its content.Results conform precisely to their own causes.These four wisdoms applied respectively to the lesser, middle, and higher levelsof the path of application are called “the twelve distinct phases that borderthe path of seeing.” The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:The distinct phases that border the path of seeingHave lesser, middle, and higher levels.The stages of wisdom on the path of application are as follows. In the stage ofheat, the attainment of light, phenomena are seen to be merely mind’s manifestappearance. This is wisdom produced by mundane meditation. A slight attainmentof this stage, “light,” corrects clinging to phenomena as real. Second, at thepeak stage of the path of application, the spread of light, in order to increasethe appearance of these positive qualities, you diligently meditate on thenonexistence of the self, which leads to the attainment of a middle level of“light” produced through mundane meditation. Third, in the forbearance stage, tohave entered only one facet of suchness is the attainment of the highest degreeof “light” produced through mundane meditation focused in the mind alone. Thiscorrects attachment to external phenomena as real. Fourth, the stage of sublimequalities (immediately followed by the path of seeing) is fullness of “light”produced through mundane meditation, without the distraction of clinging toexternal phenomena. At this point, nothing interrupts the attainment of thegreat way’s path of seeing.Of these four stages, heat and peak constitute the lesser path of application;on these levels, the time the path of seeing will arise is indefinite.Forbearance is the middle level—at this point on the path of application, thepath of seeing will definitely arise, during your next life. Sublime qualitiesis the higher level—at this point on the path of application, the path of seeingwill arise during this very lifetime.Fourth, the path of application has five special attributes: antidote,renunciation, realization, positive qualities, and superiority to the path ofcultivation. The antidote is renunciation by suppression. In general there arefour antidotes: revulsion, renunciation, support, and distance. The specialrenunciation is decline of the seeds of the obscurations and theirmanifestations, and liberation from the spiritual poverty and decline ofordinary individuals. The special realization is that of the two facets of thenonexistence of a self, attained through wisdom arisen in meditation. Thespecial qualities are possession of various positive qualities, such asmeditative states, spiritual sight, clairvoyance, and miraculous power. Thispath’s superiority to the path of cultivation is that, although this pathresembles the higher path of cultivation in regard to the wisdom produced inmeditation, it is superior to the path of cultivation due to its proximity tothe path of seeing and the comparatively stable intensity of its wisdom.The Path of Seeing [C]An explanation of the path of seeing describes its support and nature;Its nature has cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics,example,Classification, and special attributes. Its classification has the sixteeninstants and the seven aspects of awakening—Mindfulness, analysis of phenomena,Diligence, joy, extreme skill, meditative states, and equanimity.Its special attributes are the antidote, renunciation, time, realization, andqualities.The enumeration has characteristics, classification, and the way ofrenunciation.Classified according to essence, there are six; according to misunderstanding,ten;Or according to what is renounced on the path of seeing, one hundred and twelve.The special qualities are that in one instant,You see one hundred buddhas, you receive one hundred buddhas’ blessings,You go to one hundred pure lands and receive instruction for one hundred eons,Your wisdom comprehends one hundred lifetimes, such as those in the past orfuture,You enter into one hundred meditative states and bring one hundred beings tospiritual maturity,You move one hundred realms, illuminate one hundred realms,Open one hundred doors to spiritual instruction, and teach in one hundred forms,Each form surrounded by one hundred disciples.The fault of greed is purified and the transcendent perfection of generosity iscompleted.On the stage of Intense Joy, you take the form of the ruler of this world, theLand of Jambu.The explanation of the path of seeing has two parts, its support and its nature.The support of the path of seeing (that is, the kind of being who can enter thispath) can be either physical or mental. The physical support is any being amongthe five classes of beings. The Discourse Requested by Stable Intellect states:Among children of the gods living in the desire and form realms, ninety-sixmillion have dustless, pure, immaculate spiritual eyes that see the nature ofreality.Here, the term “dustless spiritual eyes” indicates attainment of the path ofseeing; “very pure,” the wisdom of awakening’s eighth stage. The mental supportis any being living in the heavens of the four levels of meditative stability.The path of seeing’s nature has three parts: cause, result, and essence. Thecauses of the path of seeing are the great way paths of cultivation andapplication; its results are the path of meditation and the path of no furthertraining.The path of seeing’s essence has four parts: characteristics, examples,classifications, and special attributes. The great way path of seeing’scharacteristics are forbearance of phenomena, knowledge of them, subsequentforbearance, and subsequent knowledge (along with subjects attendant to each).Acts that can be appropriately designated as the great way path of seeing areillustrated by any ennobling act of the great way, done after the path ofapplication has been completed, that causes the first instant of thetranscendent path of meditation to arise in an individual’s conscious stream ofbeing.The example of the path of seeing is the sixteen instants and related subjects.Each of the four truths—suffering, the source of suffering, cessation, and thespiritual path—has four instants: forbearance of the knowledge of phenomena,knowledge of phenomena, forbearance of subsequent knowledge, and subsequentknowledge.Alternatively, if the example is given in relation to awakening’s stages, thepath of seeing corresponds to the first, Intense Joy. The Ornament of ManifestRealization states:For each of the truths, such as that of suffering,There are four instants—forbearance of the knowledge of phenomena, knowledge,Forbearance of subsequent knowledge, and subsequent knowledge—a total ofsixteen.The moment of the initial attainment of transcendent wisdom is accompanied byexceptional, wide-ranging joy, more exalted than any the bodhisattva has everexperienced; thus it is called Intense Joy. The Ornament of the Discoursesstates:Because it is close to awakening,And accompanied by the birth of intense joyIn seeing the accomplishment of sentient beings’ welfare,It is called Intense Joy.The path of seeing’s classification follows the order of the four truths, thusit has the nature of the sixteen instants. Meditation along the path of seeingis on the seven aspects of awakening: correct mindfulness, correct thoroughdiscernment of phenomena, correct diligence, correct joy, correct extremepurity, correct meditative states, and correct equanimity. What are these sevenlike? The Discourse That Presents the Facets of Awakening states:Manjushri, when there is no conscious recollection nor any mental effort, theinsubstantiality of all phenomena is seen; this is the aspect of awakening ofcorrect mindfulness. Manjushri, when ennobling acts, corrupting acts, andneutral acts are entirely unproduced, all phenomena dwell apart from notions ofan existent self, with nothing to focus upon; this is the aspect of awakening ofcorrect discernment of phenomena. Manjushri, when perception of the body isdestroyed, and you neither adopt nor reject the three realms, this is the aspectof awakening of correct diligence. Manjushri, when joy and its opposite aredestroyed, and joy is not engendered toward any mental formation, this is theaspect of awakening of correct joy. Manjushri, when no focus is brought to amaterial substance of focus, the mind becomes well trained in all phenomena, theaspect of awakening of correct thorough training. Manjushri, when the completedestruction of phenomena is subsequently examined, this nonconceptual mind isthe aspect of awakening of the correct meditative state. Manjushri, when you donot abide in, reinforce, attach yourself to, or cling to phenomena, you areendowed with the equanimity of correct nonsight of phenomena, and thus gain joy;this is the aspect of awakening of correct equanimity.Fourth, the path of seeing has five special attributes: antidote, renunciation,time, realization, and positive qualities. First, the special antidotes: thefour forbearances of phenomena comprise the antidote of renunciation, called thepath without interruption, which completely uproots the seeds of what isrenounced on the path of seeing. The four knowledges of phenomena comprise theantidote of the support, called the path of complete liberation. The foursubsequent forbearances and the four subsequent knowledges comprise the indirectantidote, called the special path.The four knowledges of phenomena—knowledge of the phenomena of suffering, oftheir origin, of their cessation, and of the spiritual path—concern the essenceof a single mental substance, divided into four in relation to the four truths.The subsequent forbearances and subsequent knowledges follow a similar pattern.The special renunciation on the path of seeing has two parts: the essence ofthat renunciation and its enumeration. First, the essence of the specialrenunciation on the path of seeing is liberation from your personal degree ofthe two obscurations renounced on the path of seeing—the obscuration of mentalafflictions and cognitive obscurations. Distinguishing the Middle from theExtremes states:The two obscurations are taught to beThe obscuration due to mental afflictions and cognitive obscurations.Within them, all obscurations are gathered;Their exhaustion is considered to be liberation.The Highest Continuity states:Discursive thoughts of greed and so onAre considered to be an obscuration due to mental afflictions.Discursive thoughts in relation to the three spheres of agent, act, andrecipientAre considered to be a cognitive obscuration.The obscuration of mental afflictions, such as greed, can be defined as theessence of corrupting acts that intensely disturb the mind or as the essence ofobscuring acts of undetermined value. Cognitive obscurations, the subject-objectexperience of dualistic thoughts, can be defined as the essence of contaminatedennobling acts or of nonobscuring acts of undetermined value performed withcontinual clinging to the reality of the three spheres of agent, act, andrecipient. Among these, conceptual obscurations of mental afflictions arerenounced on the path of seeing; those which are innate are renounced on thepath of meditation. Coarse dualistic thoughts related to cognitive obscurationsare renounced on the path of seeing; subtle ones, on the path of meditation.Second, the enumeration of the obscurations renounced on the path of seeing hasthree parts: characteristics, classifications, and ways of renunciation. First,these obscurations’ characteristic is any conceptualization that impedes thepath of seeing.Second, the classification of these obscurations has three parts: according toessence, misunderstandings, and realms and misleading influences. If classifiedaccording to their essence, six obscurations are renounced on the path ofseeing: desire, anger, pride, ignorance, views, and doubt. If classifiedaccording to misleading influence, ten obscurations are renounced on the path ofseeing: five views—the view that considers impermanent collections of phenomenato constitute a self, the view that clings to extremes, wrong views, the viewthat clings to any view as supreme, the view that clings to ethical conduct anddiscipline as supreme—and five nonviews—desire, anger, pride, ignorance, anddoubt. If classified according to specific realms and misleading influences, onehundred and twelve aspects of obscurations are renounced on the path of seeing:When the five views are applied to the four truths (such as the truth ofsuffering, and the others, in the desire realm) and the five nonviews arelikewise applied to each of the four truths, each truth has ten, a total offorty. Likewise, when they are applied to the four truths in the two higherrealms of form and formlessness, nine aspects of obscurations (anger isexcluded) are renounced in each realm. Thus, for the four heavens of meditativestability, there is a total of thirty-six. The five views and four nonviewsapplied to the formless heavens’ four truths give another thirty-six, a total ofone hundred and twelve.Third, how those obscurations are renounced on the path of seeing is as follows.On the distinct levels of the path of application that border the path ofseeing, the seeds of obscurations are suppressed, whereas at the instants offorbearance of knowledge of phenomena, and so on (that is, on the path of seeingitself), they are uprooted.Forbearance produced by knowledge of phenomena of the four truths (the actualcause), converges with the seeds of what is renounced on the path of seeing (theperpetuating cause). The actual cause acts as a coincident condition that stemsthe continuity of the seeds at the same time as forbearance of phenomena arises.Since the seeds of what is renounced are destroyed in the first instant, nofurther destroying factor is necessary. Therefore, in the second instant, at theknowledge of phenomena, you attain direct liberation from the seeds of what isrenounced on the path of seeing.The four subsequent forbearances and four subsequent knowledges arise after thepath of seeing’s two previous wisdoms, which are antidotes for the extremelysubtle obscurations renounced at each stage; these two wisdoms that liberatefrom the seeds of what is renounced are distant antidotes. From the perspectiveof the instants of each of the four truths and what is renounced at each, theyact as antidotes that progressively exhaust the defilements. From theperspective of the arising of wisdom, when the forbearance of phenomena appearsat the path without interruption and the path of complete liberation, what wasnot seen is seen; thus, it is called the path of seeing.When powerful obscurations to be renounced on these stages encounter wisdom’songoing cause, they are suppressed; when those which are not powerful meetwisdom’s actual cause, they decline. At the same moment actual wisdom arises,what is renounced ceases along with its seeds. Additional wisdom distances youfrom what is to be renounced, and thus acts as the antidote that sets in motionthe path of complete liberation.Third, the special time is explained as follows. At the beginning, the fourforbearances of phenomena related to the four truths arise simultaneously. Then,the four knowledges of phenomena arise simultaneously. Then, the four subsequentforbearances arise simultaneously, followed by the four subsequent knowledges,which arise simultaneously. Thus, the four instants of completed action arise asan essence, the four divisions (that is, the four truths) that have sixteenaspects, since the four truths are realized together, whereas the fourforbearances and knowledges arise sequentially.Fourth, the path of seeing’s special realization is transcendent sublime insightthat directly realizes the two aspects of the nonexistence of a self. Moreover,since the basic space of phenomena pervades self and other equally, this specialrealization leads to the realization of awakened mind in which self and otherare equal.Fifth, the path of seeing’s special qualities are that, in one instant, you havethe capability to display twelve positive qualities, each to the power of onehundred, and you have such inconceivable positive qualities as spiritual sight,clairvoyance, and miraculous power. These include the following: in one instant,you see one hundred buddhas; you receive one hundred buddhas’ blessings; you goto one hundred pure lands; you can make one instant last one hundred eons; yourwisdom can span one hundred lifetimes, those of past or future; you enter intoand arise from one hundred meditative states; you bring one hundred beings tospiritual maturity; you move one hundred realms; you illuminate one hundredrealms; you open one hundred gates to spiritual instruction; you show onehundred of your own forms; and each of your forms teaches a magnificententourage of one hundred disciples.Among the mental afflictions, the fault of greed is purified on this path andthe transcendent perfection of generosity is completed. At the first stage ofawakening, Intense Joy, you can take rebirth as ruler of this world, the Land ofJambu.The Path of Meditation [D]This section has two parts: (1) a concise presentation and (2) the extensiveexplanation.A Concise Presentation of the Path of Meditation [1]The explanation of the path of meditation describes its support and nature;Its nature, cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics andexample.This presentation of the path of meditation has two parts: the path ofmeditation’s support and its nature. The physical support for the arising of thepath of meditation (that is, the kind of being who can enter this path) ismainly birth as a man or woman of the three of the four human continents, or asa male or female god of the desire or form realms. However, it is possible forit to arise in others, as stated in The Ornament of the Discourses:To take rebirth intentionally and . . .The mental support is the four levels of meditative stability.The path of meditation’s nature has three parts: its cause, result, and essence.The path of meditation’s cause is the great way’s first three paths; its resultis the path of no further training. The path of meditation’s essence has twoparts: its characteristic and its example. The path of meditation’scharacteristic is the example of the great way path that runs from awakening’ssecond stage to the stage of culmination. Acts called the great way path ofmeditation are illustrated by any ennobling act done after the completion of thepath of seeing, which causes the first instant of the path of no furthertraining to arise in an individual’s conscious stream of being. The example isennobling acts that belong to the nature of awakening’s ten stages.The Extensive Explanation of the Path of Meditation [2]Second, this section has four parts: (1) levels, (2) special attributes, (3) theeightfold exalted path, and (4) culmination.Levels of the Path of Meditation [a]On the levels of the path of meditation, its lesser, middle, and higher stagesAre each divided into three—the path of meditation’s nine stages:Immaculate, Illuminating, Radiant, Difficult to Refine,Manifest, Far Reaching, Unmoving, Excellent Intelligence.The path of meditation’s ninth stage is the tenth stage of awakening, Cloud ofthe Doctrine.The ten stages of awakening correspond to the ten transcendent perfections:generosity, ethical conduct,Patience, diligence, meditative stability, sublime insight, skillful means,force,Aspiration, and wisdom. The ten things renouncedAre greed, lapsed ethical conduct, anger, laziness,Distraction, wrong understanding, unskillful acts,Obscured force, unfulfilled aspirations, and cognitive obscurations.The path of meditation’s lesser, middle, and highest stages are each dividedinto three, thus this path yields nine stages. The lower lesser stagecorresponds to the second stage of awakening, Immaculate, and to the supremetranscendent perfection of ethical conduct. The Ornament of the Discoursesstates:Since it is free from the stains of lapsed ethical conduct,It is called Immaculate.The mid-level lesser stage corresponds to awakening’s third stage, Illuminating,and to the transcendent perfection of patience. The same text states:Since it brings supreme illumination of phenomena,It is called Illuminating.The upper lesser stage corresponds to awakening’s fourth stage, Radiant, and tothe transcendent perfection of diligence. The same text states:Since this stage of awakeningPossesses an intensely burning lightOf positive qualities concordant with awakeningThat consume duality, it is Radiant.The lower middle stage corresponds to awakening’s fifth stage, Difficult toRefine, and to the transcendent perfection of meditative stability. The sametext states:To bring sentient beings to full maturityAnd to guard your own mindAre difficult tasks for wise persons;Thus this stage is called Difficult to Refine.The mid-level middle stage corresponds to awakening’s sixth stage, Manifest, andto the transcendent perfection of sublime insight. The same text states:Based on the transcendent perfection of sublime insight,Both the round of rebirth and transcendent statesBecome manifest at this stage of awakening;Thus it is called Manifest.The upper middle stage corresponds to awakening’s seventh stage, Far Reaching,and to the transcendent perfection of skillful means. The same text states:Since it is related to traversing the single path,It is called the Far Reaching stage of awakening.Further, Praise of the Basic Space of Phenomena states:As it crosses the mire of the sea of existence,It is called Far Reaching.The lower highest stage corresponds to awakening’s eighth stage, Unmoving, andto the transcendent perfection of force. The same text states:Since it is unmoved by the two perceptions,It is called the Unmoving stage of awakening.The mid-level highest stage corresponds to awakening’s ninth stage, ExcellentIntelligence, and to the full completion of the transcendent perfection ofaspiration. The same text states:The excellent intellect of perfect discerning awarenessIs the Excellent Intelligence stage of awakening.The upper highest stage corresponds to awakening’s tenth stage, Cloud of theDoctrine, and to the transcendent perfection of wisdom. The same text states:Since, like clouds, the two pervade space,It is Cloud of the Doctrine.The two clouds alluded to in this quote are meditative states and recollectionmantras that pervade the space of disciples and serve them with a rain of thedoctrine, like that produced by the transcendent buddhas. The Highest Continuitystates:This way of bodhisattvasIn their postmeditative stateEquals the pure liberation of sentient beings within the worldPerformed by the transcendent buddhas.Although this statement has been made in relation to the similarity betweenbuddhas and bodhisattvas in styles of enlightened activity, the buddhas aresuperior in both acts and activity. The same text states:Nevertheless, the differenceBetween the whole earth and a dust moteOr the ocean and water in a cow’s hoofprintIs comparable to the difference between a buddha and a bodhisattva.Therefore, the nine stages of the path of meditation are divided in relation tothe nine ways in which positive qualities arise due to nine higher, middle, orlesser antidotes to their respective obscurations.What is renounced on this path are unethical conduct, anger, laziness,distraction, incorrect understanding, unskillful acts, obscured force,unfulfilled aspirations, and cognitive obscurations.Special Attributes of the Path of Meditation [b]Second, this section has five parts: (1) antidotes, (2) renunciation, (3)realization, (4) qualities, and (5) assumed forms.Antidotes on the Path of Meditation [i]At the nine stages, the path of application and the path without interruptionare antidotes of renunciation;In the main part of a stage, the path of complete liberation is the antidote ofthe support;And at the end of a stage, the special path is the antidote of distance.The special antidotes on the path of meditation are explained as follows. Fromthe perspective of renunciation of defilements on awakening’s nine stages, thepath of meditation’s path of application and its path without interruption areantidotes based on renunciation; its path of complete liberation is the antidotebased on support; and its special path is the antidote based on distance.To explain this, before a stage of awakening is reached, the path ofmeditation’s path of application entails the renunciation of coarse obscurationsin order to hinder what must be renounced at a specific stage. At the initialarising of a stage of awakening, the path without interruption entails theactual renunciation of seeds of defilements related to that specific stage. Thepath of complete liberation begins from the second instant of a stage ofawakening and continues during its main part. At the conclusion of a stage,after its special qualities are attained, the special path is the continuingmovement toward a higher stage.Renunciation on the Path of Meditation [ii]Four hundred and forty aspects of the mental afflictions and cognitiveobscurations are renounced.The path of meditation’s special renunciations are the thorough rejection ofwhat is renounced on the path of seeing; and, among what is renouncedspecifically on the path of meditation, the rejection of the coarse obscurationsand the beginning of rejection of subtle obscurations. In essence, what isrenounced on the path of meditation are the innate aspects of the obscurationsof mental afflictions and the cognitive obscurations.The classification of these renunciations has four parts: classification byessence, realm, stages, and levels. Classified by essence, the obscurations tobe renounced have six aspects—desire, anger, pride, ignorance, the view ofimpermanent phenomena as a self, and the view that clings to extremes.Classified by realm, six obscurations are renounced in the desire realm and fiveeach (anger is the missing one of the six) in the upper two realms, a total ofsixteen. Classified by stages, in the desire realm there are six; on the fourlevels of meditative stability, four groups of five; on the four levels offormlessness, four groups of five—a total of forty-six.If classified by levels and categories of greater and middle obscurations, onnine levels (a number that refers in this case to the desire realm; the first,second, third, and fourth levels of meditative stability; and the four levels ofthe formless realm—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothing whatsoever,and pinnacle of existence), each of the nine kinds of greater and middle desireyields eighty-one. Likewise, nine sets of nine kinds of pride, nine kinds ofignorance, nine kinds of view of impermanent phenomena as a self, and nine kindsof extreme views—five times eighty-one—a total of four hundred and five, towhich the medium anger of the desire realm must be added, a grand total of fourhundred and fourteen. These are renounced on each of the path of meditation’sfour levels—application, without interruption, complete liberation, and special.Realization on the Path of Meditation [iii]At awakening’s first stage, the mind’s luminous nature is realized in evenness.At the second, what you have realized is realized to be supreme, and you clearaway impurities.At the third, you are diligent in hearing the doctrine to realize the basicspace of phenomena.At the fourth, you renouce attachment without clinging to the self.At the fifth, you realize that the innate constituent enlightenment in your ownand others’ minds is not separate.At the sixth, through realization of the natural purity of the innateconstituent, you rest without clinging.At the seventh, you overcome clinging to traits through nonseparateness.At the eighth, through realization of the unaltered essence, you gainforbearance of the unborn nature of phenomena.At the ninth, you realize that the innate constituent inherently has individualawareness.At the tenth, you realize the innate constituent to be a source of enlightenedactivity and you master the four powers.The special realizations are as follows. At awakening’s first stage, the essenceof the mind’s nature, luminosity, is realized to pervade all beings. This marksthe realization of awakened mind’s evenness of self and others. At the secondstage, that essence is understood as supreme among realizations: you developdiligence in cleansing the impurities that cover your innate constituentenlightenment. At the third stage, with the realization that hearing thedoctrine is of a similar substance to the basic space of phenomena, to listen tothe doctrine you would cross the cosmos even if it were one solid mass of fire.At the fourth stage, you realize that in basic space there is no clinging to asense of self, and you relinquish attachment to phenomena.At the fifth stage, you realize that the innate constituent enlightenmentpresent within the mind of yourself and others is not separate and thus realizeevenness in the ten pure thoughts of all buddhas. The ten pure thoughts arepositive qualities (counted as three), training (counted as three), thespiritual path, knowledge of what is not the path, the thirty-seven facets ofawakening, and spiritual maturation of sentient beings (three each—with body,speech, and mind—are counted for the first two).At the sixth stage, you realize the natural purity of the innate constituentenlightenment: you entirely reverse clinging to acceptance or rejection of theround of rebirth and transcendent states. At the seventh stage, you realize thenonseparateness of the innate constituent enlightenment: you reverse allclinging to traits of phenomena as existent. At the eighth stage, you realizethat the faults or positive qualities of that very essence neither diminish norincrease: your supreme forbearance toward the unborn nature of phenomena becomesextremely pure. At the ninth stage, you realize that the innate constituentenlightenment inherently possesses four aspects of awareness: you gain masteryof wisdom. At the tenth stage, you realize that the innate constituentenlightenment is itself a source of magnificent enlightened activity: you attainmastery of the four powers. Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes states:These are the categories of the four powers:All-pervasive aid for beings, the best purpose,Supreme accomplishment concordant with the cause of liberation;Accomplishment without any clinging whatsoever;Accomplishment without separateness;And accomplishment that does not diminish or increase:At the eighth stage of awakening, you attain mastery of nondiscursiveness, dueto the transformation of the afflictive mind, as well as control of the purelands, due to the transformation of the clinging consciousness of the five sensegates. At the ninth stage of awakening, due to the transformation of mentalconsciousness, you gain mastery of the four individual genuine awarenesses andmastery of magnificent enlightened activity through which you bring sentientbeings to spiritual maturity. At the tenth stage of awakening, mastery of wisdomlike a mirror is attained, due to the immediate transformation of the storehouseconsciousness (ground for the arising of discursive thought and mentalconsciousness). The supreme enlightened activity performed by bodhisattvas atthis stage can be said to be similar to that of the buddhas.Qualities on the Path of Meditation [iv]The qualities at the first stage of awakening are twelve times one hundred.Increasing, at the second, to twelve times one thousand.At the third, twelve times one hundred thousand.At the fourth, twelve times ten million.At the fifth, twelve times one thousand ten million.At the sixth, twelve times one hundred thousand ten million.At the seventh, twelve times one hundred thousand million times ten million.At the eighth, twelve times the atoms in one hundred thousand cosmos.At the ninth, twelve times the atoms in one hundred thousand incalculablecosmos.At the tenth, qualities will appear equal to twelve times the atoms ofinexpressibly numerous realms.The path of meditation’s special qualities are explained as follows. Atawakening’s second stage, the positive qualities of awakening’s first stage(mentioned above as the path of seeing’s special qualities, the twelve positivequalities times one hundred) are the same twelve positive qualities times onethousand; at the third stage, twelve times one hundred thousand; at the fourthstage, twelve times ten million; at the fifth stage, twelve times one thousandten million; at the sixth stage, twelve times one hundred thousand ten million;at the seventh stage, twelve times one hundred thousand million times tenmillion; at the eighth stage, twelve times a number equal to the atoms in onehundred thousand cosmos; at the ninth stage, twelve times a number equal to theatoms in one hundred thousand incalculable cosmos; and at the tenth stage, youhave the power to make manifest in each instant the twelve positive qualities,such as seeing buddhas, equal to the number of infinitesimal particles ofinexpressibly numerous atoms of inexpressibly numerous pure lands of thebuddhas. In each of your hair pores dwell distinct pure lands of the buddhas. Ineach of these at the same time, you serve sentient beings through such acts asthe Buddha’s twelve deeds.These positive qualities arise from the force of the gradual separation ofobscurations from your innate constituent enlightenment. Although you see themas new, they are not newly attained nor do they arise where they were previouslynonexistent. These positive qualities and infinite others are primordiallyever-present. They appear through purification due to the fresh sight of yourown innate constituent enlightenment.Assumed Forms on the Path of Meditation [v]At the second stage, you take birth as the wheel-monarch of the four continents;At the third, as Shakra; at the fourth, as the ruler of the Sumaya gods;At the fifth, as the ruler of Joyful Heaven; at the sixth, as the ruler of theHeaven of Joy in Creation;At the seventh, as the ruler of the Heaven of Control of Others’ Creations;At the eighth, as Brahma, general chief of a simple cosmos;At the ninth, as Great Brahma, chief of a double cosmos;At the tenth, as Great Vishnu, chief of a triple cosmos.The special assumed forms are as follows: at the second stage of awakening, youtake birth as the universal monarch of the four continents; at the third, asShakra; at the fourth, as the ruler of the Sumaya gods; at the fifth, as theruler of Joyful Heaven; at the sixth, as ruler of the Heaven of Joy in Creation;at the seventh, as ruler of the Heaven of Control of Others’ Creations; at theeighth, as Brahma, the general chief of a simple cosmos; at the ninth, as GreatBrahma, chief of a double cosmos; and at the tenth, as Great Vishnu, chief of atriple cosmos. The Flower Ornament Discourse states:Those who rest here at this stage of awakening become lords of the three realms.Although these bodhisattvas have the capability to take rebirth as rulers, notall take such rebirth; nor are all such rulers persons who rest on stages of abodhisattva’s awakening. Some are ordinary beings who have accumulated aprodigious measure of goodness, whereas in some cases, it is said thatmanifestations of transcendent buddhas appear as those individuals to servesentient beings.The Eightfold Exalted Path [c]At the tenth stage, the eightfold exalted path entails correct view, thought,speech, action,Livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and meditative states.On these stages of awakening, you meditate on the eightfold exalted path asstated in The Discourse That Presents the Facets of Awakening:Manjushri, those who see all phenomena as nondual, without unevenness amongthem, have the correct view. Manjushri, those who, by “not seeing” phenomena,see them without analysis, complete lack of analysis, and total lack ofanalysis, have correct thought. Manjushri, those who see the inexpressiblenature of all phenomena have correct speech. Manjushri, those who see the lackof function and the inactive nature of all phenomena have correct action.Manjushri, those who see all phenomena to be without increase or diminishmenthave correct livelihood. Manjushri, those who completely accomplish allphenomena by seeing all phenomena to be without effort and accomplishment havecorrect effort. Manjushri, those who see all phenomena to be without mentalactivity and without recollection have correct mindfulness. Manjushri, sincephenomena are without reference points, those who see no reference point andsettle in evenness naturally unperturbed have correct meditative states.Culmination of the Path of Meditation [d]Bodhisattvas at the point of culmination make offeringsTo all victors of the ten directions. From all the victors’ foreheadsThe supreme luminosity empowerment dissolves into the crowns of thebodhisattvas’ heads.They attain vajra-like and other meditative states,Numbering incalculable hundred thousands. These end their cognitiveobscurations:The qualities of their innate constituent are actualized and they attainenlightenment.From awakening’s first stage upward, bodhisattvas gain control over longevity.Therefore, for them, birth and death do not actually exist in themselves, yetfor the welfare of sentient beings they demonstrate such events. At the eighthstage, bodhisattvas gain mastery of the wisdoms of evenness and discernment; atthe ninth, of all-accomplishing wisdom; and at the tenth, of mirrorlikewisdom—four wisdoms in all. At the point of culmination, as soon as the generalbasis for various habitual tendencies has been transformed within itself,bodhisattvas gain mastery of the wisdom of the basic space of phenomena andreach buddhahood.At the culmination of awakening’s tenth stage, the empowerment of supremeluminosity is bestowed. The Ornament of the Discourses states:When you reach the end of the path of meditation,The empowerment of supreme luminosity is bestowed.You realize the vajra-like meditative stateAnd attain indestructibility:You are transformed; this is the consummate conclusion—You have no stain of any obscuration.Once resting there, you fully accomplishAid to all sentient beings;You attain the unsurpassable stateOf complete omniscience.As soon as tenth-stage bodhisattvas have made prodigious offerings to allvictors of the ten directions, a mass of light emerges from every victor’sforehead and dissolves into the crown of the bodhisattvas’ heads. Bodhisattvasthus attain vajra-like and countless millions of other meditative states theyhad not previously attained. These purify even subtle cognitive obscurations,and the bodhisattvas attain enlightenment.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSGenerosity is an inexhaustible vast ocean;Ethical conduct, a harmless foundation of good earth;Patience, secure, supreme armor;Diligence, a quick, untiring horse;Meditative stability, an unchanging inviolable state;Sublime insight, an unstoppable diamond weapon.The gift of necessary things is the best hook to attract a circle of disciples.Pleasant speech is the captivating music of a tambura.Teaching according to the disciples’ levels causes a rain of various wished-forthings.Conduct that conforms to the teachings sounds the divine drum to summon a greatassembly.The thirty-seven facets of awakening are the great constellations.The activity of purification and crossing the paths of spiritual developmentcause the lotus garden to blossom.This concludes the commentary to “The Path of the Middle Way,” Book 9 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall ways of spiritual development. This has been written by Longchen ChoyingTobden Dorje. Since temporary welfare and ultimate happiness solely depend onthe cultivation of the stores of goodness and wisdom, you must always diligentlyamass wealth in goodness and wisdom.Fortune!This text has been printed for the spread and increase of the Victor Lord of theShakya’s doctrine and that sentient beings might gain the glory of joy andhappiness.

A Brief Presentation of the Support and Nature of the Path of No FurtherTraining2. An Extensive Explanation of the Path of No Further Training3. A Detailed Presentation of Special Characteristics of the Path of No FurtherTrainingTHE SUPPORT AND NATURE OF THE PATH OF NO FURTHER TRAINING [I][05_toc-title.html#sec-37]Upon reaching the end of training in and traversing the paths and stages ofawakening, and the twofold cultivation, as described,The path of no further training is reached. It is explained through adescription of its support and nature.Its nature has cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics andexamples.This presentation of the path of no further training has two parts: its supportand nature. There are two supports (that is, the kind of being who can enterthis path). The common Buddhist perspective is a belief that the physicalsupport that leads to enlightenment is life as a human being among royalty orthe brahmin caste in the Land of Jambu. Nevertheless, the special perspective isa belief that the physical support for this path is life as any being whoattains enlightenment in the Highest Pure Land, after which an emanation of thatindividual appears in the realms of beings, in whatever support is appropriateto lead them to enlightenment. The mental support for this path is the fourthlevel of meditative stability.Second, the nature of the path of no further training has three parts: cause,result, and essence. The cause of the path of no further training is completionof the twofold cultivation of goodness and wisdom along the four paths oftraining. Its result is the magnificent activity of enlightenment, which placesall beings in the three states of awakening.The essence of the path of no further training has two parts: itscharacteristics and examples. The characteristics of the path of no furthertraining are the ennobling acts of perfect renunciation and realization asdefined by the great way; for example, it is correct to designate the threebodies of enlightenment with their wisdoms as the great way’s path of no furthertraining. Examples include the body of ultimate enlightenment’s ten positivequalities of no further training, five uncontaminated psychophysicalaggregations, and six transcendent perfections.THE PATH OF NO FURTHER TRAINING [II] [05_toc-title.html#sec-38]This chapter has three parts: (1) the support, the bodies of enlightenment, (2)the content of the path of no further learning, wisdom, and (3) the deeds,enlightened activity.The Support, the Bodies of Enlightenment [A]This section has three parts: (1) the body of ultimate enlightenment, (2) thebody of the perfect rapture of enlightenment, and (3) the manifest body ofenlightenment.The Body of Ultimate Enlightenment [1]The essential wisdom body abides in the nature of reality, supreme purity andevenness.The body of ultimate enlightenment, the qualities of the innate constituentenlightenment fully manifest,Has twenty-one groups of wisdom’s qualities:(1) Thirty-seven facets of awakening—four foundations for mindfulness,Four correct renunciations, four supports for miraculous powers,Five powers, five forces, seven aspects of awakening,And the eightfold exalted path. (2) Four immeasurable aspirations—Love, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.(3) Eight forms of freedom—of an embodied being, formless being,Beauty, the four stages of arising and development, and cessation.(4) Nine states of meditative composure—four levels of mental stability, fourlevels of formlessness, and cessation.(5) Ten unlimited spheres of meditative control—earth, water, fire, air, blue,yellow, red,White, space, and consciousness.(6) Eight overpowering spheres of meditative control—by those with personal formover small external form;Personal form over large external form;Formless over small or large; formless, by perception;Over blue, yellow, red, and white.(7) To relieve mental afflictions from others’ minds. (8) To know formeraspirations.(9) Six forms of clairvoyance—miraculous powers, divine hearing, Knowledge ofothers’ thoughts, recollection of past existences, Divine sight, and thecessation of contamination.(10) Four modes of correct discerning awareness—of phenomena, meaning,Definitions, and confidence.(11) Four purities—of the support, intention, wisdom mind, and wisdom.(12) Ten powers—over longevity, mind, necessities, action, birth, Intent,aspiration, miracles, wisdom, and instruction.(13) Ten forces—knowledge of positive or negative fields of action, maturationof deeds,Interests, faculties, acumen, the paths to every destination,Purification, recollection, death and birth, and the cessation of contamination.(14) Four kinds of fearlessness—toward realization, impediments, the path, andrenunciation.(15) Unguarded pure conduct of body, speech, and mind.(16) Three kinds of mindfulness—without attachment, anger, or indifference.(17) No lapse in helping beings. (18) To have overcome all habitual patterns.(19) Supreme nondual compassion.(20) Eighteen unique qualities—the first six are no mistakes, no faulty speech,perfect memory,No gap in settling in evenness, no dualistic perception, no nondiscerningequanimity.The second six are consistent intention, diligence, recollection, meditativestates, sublime insight,And complete liberation.The third six are that the acts of body, speech, and mind are preceded andfollowed by wisdom;And perception of the three times (past, present, and future) is withoutattachment and impediment.(21) Three forms of knowledge—knowledge of everything, knowledge of the path,and knowledge of every basis.The aspect of the pure, even, empty basic space of phenomena, which forms thebasic nature of enlightenment’s bodies, is called “the essential wisdom body.”The essence of awareness, the wisdom of culminant renunciation and realization,is endowed with twenty-one groups of positive qualities: this is called“realization of wisdom, the body of ultimate enlightenment.” This is becauseanything affirmed as enlightenment’s wisdom consists of the manifest presence ofthe ultimate basic space of awareness.These twenty-one groups of positive qualities are as follows: (1) Thethirty-seven facets of awakening are four foundations for mindfulness, fourcorrect renunciations, four supports for miraculous powers, five powers, fiveforces, seven aspects of awakening, and the eightfold exalted path.(2) The four immeasurable aspirations are love, compassion, sympathetic joy, andequanimity.(3) The eight forms of complete freedom are as follows. The freedom of anembodied being seeing form occurs when a being’s personal appearance of form hasnot stopped, outer form is seen as the magical display of nondual appearance andemptiness, and attachment to the reality of appearances is thereby counteracted.The freedom of a formless being seeing form occurs when a being has no referenceto personal form; the sight of outer form is free from attachment to the realityof outer and inner appearances. Freedom of removal of hindrances of beauty isfreedom from all grasping due to seeing the single flavor of all phenomena inemptiness. Freedom of formless composure within the sphere of boundless space issight of the meaning of the space-like nature of mind. Freedom of formlesscomposure within the sphere of boundless consciousness is the realization thateverything is the display of mind and wisdom. Freedom of formless composurewithin the sphere of nothingness is to be without dualistic clinging in relationto any external or internal phenomena. Freedom of formless composure within thesphere in which there is neither perception nor the absence of perception is thestilling of the domains of formulation and defining traits. Freedom of cessationis the state that can never be disturbed by focus upon or attachment to anyphenomena, such as those of the round of rebirth or transcendent states.(4) The nine states of meditative composure are to enter composure in the fourlevels of meditative stability, the four levels of formlessness, and cessation.(5) The ten unlimited spheres of meditative control are as follows: earth,water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, white, space, and consciousness.(6) The eight overpowering spheres of meditative control are as follows. Thosewho have a personal form can, with a small appearance, see small external formsand overpower them. Those who have a personal form can see large external formsand overpower them. Likewise, those without form can see small or large formsand overpower them. Those constitute four; the next four are the overpowering ofshapes: those without a personal form can, through perception alone, overpowerthen see blue, yellow, red, and white. Thus, there are eight in all.(7) To destroy mental afflictions is to destroy mental afflictions by relievingthem from others’ stream of being. (8) To know former aspirations is to havewhatever is done be produced spontaneously, thus to know your formeraspirations.(9) The six forms of clairvoyance are as follows. The clairvoyance of miraculouspowers are such feats as causing earthquakes, transformation of many into one,or multiplication of one into many. The clairvoyance of divine hearing is torealize precisely the extent of every sound, large or small, in the worldlyrealm. The clairvoyance of knowledge of others’ thoughts is to have definitivemanifest knowledge of others’ minds, such as whether or not they are free frommental afflictions. The clairvoyance of recollection of past existences isknowledge of hundreds or thousands or more of your own or others’ past lives.The clairvoyance of divine sight is direct realization of all form, large orsmall, regardless of distance. The clairvoyance of the cessation ofcontamination is knowledge of the means to renounce the two obscurations andclairvoyance after they have been relinquished.(10) The four modes of correct discerning awareness are as follows. Correctdiscerning awareness of phenomena is easy understanding of the constituents ofthe phenomena of utterly obscuring mental afflictions, their completepurification, and the enumeration of terms. Correct discerning awareness ofmeaning is unhesitant and unobstructed understanding based on unmistaken,undeluded knowledge of the specific and general characteristics of thosephenomena. Correct discerning awareness of definitions is speech that is usefulin every circumstance, spoken in relation to the domain of beings to bespiritually guided. Correct discerning awareness of confidence is understandingwithout impediment gained from knowledge of the essence of your own being itselfand all appearing aspects of phenomena.(11) The four purities are complete purity of the support, intention, wisdommind, and wisdom.(12) The ten powers are power over longevity, since you have the ability to liveuntil the end of the eon, if you wish; power over mind, gained from control ofcountless gates to meditative states; power over necessities, gained frommastery of the inexhaustible nature of the treasury of space; power overactivity, gained from mastery of showing the results of activity, such as thosein the arts of construction and artistic skills; power over birth, gained fromthe capability to be born in any form and wherever wished; power over intent,gained from such capabilities as being able to show all worldly realms as fullof enlightenment’s wisdom forms; power over aspiration, gained from the abilityto spread manifestations of supreme awakening; power over miracles, gained fromthe ability to show many different miracles to various kinds of disciplessimultaneously; power over wisdom, gained from the unobstructed knowledge of allphenomena; and power over instruction, gained from erudition in all words andmeanings of the teachings.(13) The ten forces are as follows. Knowledge of positive or negative fields ofaction is knowledge without impediment of the results (happiness, suffering, orneutral) that arise from causes (ennobling, corrupting, or mixed conduct) and,likewise, knowledge of that which is not deceptive (correct conduct) andwhatever is its opposite (incorrect conduct). Knowledge of deeds and of theirmaturation is thorough knowledge of the ripening of deeds that produce thesubstance of the three times and knowledge of those deeds—wished for, unwishedfor, or neither of the two; and the state of exhaustion of mental afflictions,uncontaminated deeds. Knowledge of various interests is precise sight of theinterests of ordinary individuals and those of the exalted assembly of the past,present, and future, including such individuals as those who have various mentalafflictions, such as desire; others, who are on an intermediate level; and theparticularly sublime assembly. Knowledge of various faculties is simultaneousknowledge of the distinct, separate sensory bases—the five sense organs thathave form, such as the eyes; the five without form, such as the senses’consciousnesses; the five sense pleasures, the connection between the senses andtheir pleasures as subject and object; the sixteen emptinesses of the nature ofphenomena—and the entire range of existent phenomena in the three times.Knowledge of supreme and nonsupreme acumen is sight of the twenty-two facets ofthe senses, such as the eyes, along with their results; and of every grade oftheir specific degrees of acumen—acute, intermediate, or dull. Knowledge of thepaths to every destination is knowledge of the form of every path—the correctpaths, such as those of the six kinds of beings, the hearers, the solitarysages, and enlightened beings; and the paths that lead in the wrong direction.Knowledge of completely obscuring mental afflictions and their purification isthe knowledge, within infinite realms of worlds throughout past, present, andfuture, of the distinct, separate qualities of complete purification and statesof intense mental afflictions, such as the four levels of meditative stability,the eight complete freedoms, and the nine culminant states of meditativecomposure. Knowledge of recollection of previous places and times is directsight of and impeccable recollection of your own and others’ previous forms andcircumstances. Knowledge of death and birth is, like the sight of previousplaces, impeccable sight of every circumstance of your own and others’ death,transmigration, and rebirth. Knowledge of the cessation of contamination is theimpeccable sight of all circumstances of relinquishment related to the threestates of awakening (that of hearers, solitary sages, and unsurpassable); and tothe circumstance of contamination’s cessation.(14) The four forms of fearlessness are as follows. Fearlessness towardmagnificent realization is the Buddha’s affirmation of impeccable knowledge ofthe nature of all phenomena: “I have attained manifest, complete enlightenment,”a statement that cannot be contradicted with valid arguments. Fearlessnesstoward the teaching concerning what impedes enlightenment: it cannot becontradicted with seemingly valid arguments, such as this spurious objection,“You have not relinquished that which must be renounced, which hinders freedomand omniscience, subsumed in the obscurations of mental afflictions andcognitive obscurations.” Fearlessness toward teaching the path of certainarising is that, in teaching the path of the certain arising of freedom andomniscience (such as knowledge of the basis and knowledge of the path), theteaching cannot be contradicted by seemingly valid arguments such as, “Althoughyou teach this path, it cannot lead to certain arising.” Fearlessness towardmagnificent renunciation is the affirmation, “I have exhausted every impurity,”that cannot be contradicted by seemingly valid arguments, such as “This impurityis not exhausted.”(15) The three kinds of unguardedness are no thought to conceal wrongdoing, dueto holy conduct of wisdom body, speech, and mind. (16) The three kinds ofmindfulness are to remain in equanimity, detached from attachment, anger, orindifference toward, respectively, those who want to listen to the doctrine,those who do not, and those who have both feelings. (17) No lapse means no lapsein service to sentient beings. (18) To have overcome habitual patterns is tohave defeated all defiled habitual patterns. (19) Supreme nondual compassion isthe motivation of supreme, altruistic nondual compassion toward all beings.(20) The Buddha’s eighteen unique qualities are in three groups of six. Thefirst six are the following: buddhas do not make mistakes in physical conduct,they have no faults in speech, no lapses in memory, no gap in settling inevenness, no perception of duality, and no nondiscerning equanimity. The secondsix are the following: buddhas are not subject to failure in intention,diligence, recollection, meditative states, sublime insight, or completeliberation. The third six are the following: buddhas’ acts of wisdom body,speech, mind are preceded and followed by wisdom. Their wisdom withoutimpediment comprehends the three times—past, present, and future.(21) The three forms of knowledge are omniscience itself, knowledge of the path,and knowledge of every basis.These twenty-one groups of positive qualities comprise the body of ultimateenlightenment. The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:These are what is known as the body of ultimate enlightenment:The thirty-seven facets that accord with awakening; the four immeasurableaspirations;Eight forms of freedom;The epitome of the nine forms of culminant meditative composure;The epitome of the ten unlimited spheres of meditative control;The overpowering spheres of meditative controlDifferentiated in eight forms;Absence of mental afflictions; knowledge of aspirations;Clairvoyance; perfect understanding;Four purities;Ten powers; ten forces;Four forms of fearlessness;Three kinds of unguardedness;Three kinds of mindfulness;No lapse in the nature of reality;To have overcome all habitual patterns;Supreme nondual compassion for beings;Eighteen qualities uniqueTo Shakyamuni alone, as taught;And three aspects of omniscience.The Body of the Perfect Rapture of Enlightenment [2]In the Highest Pure Land of Dense Array, bodies of enlightenment’s perfectrapture, five chiefs of the wisdom clans,Such as the Buddha Illuminator, display the beauty of the marks and signs ofphysical perfection.The thirty-two excellent signs are the following: (1) wheel designs on the solesand palms,(2) Flat soles, (3) webbed fingers and toes,(4) Long and narrow fingers, (5) round heels,(6) Supple hands and feet, (7) inconspicuous ankles,(8) Antelope-like calves, (9) retracted genitals,(10) Long arms that reach the knees, (11) golden color,(12) Body hair curls upward, (13) the hair curls clockwise,(14) Soft skin with no smell of perspiration, (15) fullness in seven places,(16) Well-rounded forearms and biceps, (17) lionlike torso,(18) Large and straight body, (19) symmetry like a banyan tree,(20) Lionlike jaw, (21) white teeth,(22) Even teeth equal in size, (23) complete set of forty teeth,(24) A long, wide tongue, (25) tongue that finds everything delicious,(26) An even collarbone, (27) radiance that extends one arm span,(28) Deep blue eyes, (29) eyelashes like the finest cow,(30) The melodic voice of Brahma, (31) a protuberance on the crown,And (32) a curl of hair between the eyebrows.The eighty excellent marks are the following: (1) fingernails copper-colored,(2) shiny, and (3) high in the middle;(4) Round fingers, (5) broad in span, (6) and tapered;(7) Inconspicuous veins, (8) that have no knots;(9) Ankles that do not protrude; (10) feet that are even;(11) A lion’s gait, (12) an elephant’s gait, (13) a swan’s gait, (14) abuffalo’s gait,(15) A gait tending to the right, (16) an elegant gait, (17) an erect gait, (18)a graceful gait;(19) Body is as if polished, (20) well-proportioned,(21) Clean, (22) soft, (23) pure; (24) fully developed genitals; (25) anexpansive bearing;(26) Even step; (27) clear eyes; (28) youthful, (29) not stooped; (30)full-bodied,(31) Solid; (32) limbs well defined; (33) clear vision;(34) Tapered waist; (35) belly not long, (36) not bulging or uneven;(37) A deep navel (38) that swirls clockwise; (39) an attractive demeanor; (40)pure in conduct;(41) No moles on skin; (42) soft hands; (43) lines on the palm that are clear,(44) Deep, and (45) long; (46) a face that is not too long; (47) red lips;(48) A tongue that is long, (49) fine, and (50) red;(51) A voice that is thunderous, (52) pleasing, and (53) gentle; (54) teeth thatare rounded, (55) sharp, (56) white, (57) even, and(58) Tapering; (59) high nose; (60) wide eyes,(61) Thick eyelashes, (62) eyes like lotus petals; (63) eyebrows that are long,(64) soft, and (65) shiny;(66) Eyebrows’ hair of even length; (67) long arms; (68) symmetrical ears,(69) No deficiency in hearing; (70) a forehead that is well-formed and(71) Broad; (72) large head; (73) hair that is black, (74) thick, (75) soft,(76) untangled,(77) Not unkempt, (78) and fragrant; (79) a body marked with knot of eternityand (80) auspicious emblems.The five certainties of the wisdom body of perfect rapture also include anentourage of bodhisattvas of the tenth stage of awakening,The doctrine of the great way; and permanent, continual time.The certain abode is the Highest Pure Land of Dense Array, the place wherebuddhas first reach manifest awakening. The Ornament of Dense Array Discoursestates:Dense Array’s sacred circle lies beyond the realmsOf formlessness, desire, form,And, likewise, that of no perception.There, enlightenment occurs and buddhas dwell.Beyond the three realms lies the place Dense Array where enlightenment occurs.In which direction can this place be found? Dreams arise wherever you sleep, afact that renders impossible such affirmations as, “Dreams only occur here!”Likewise, this place is located wherever you become entirely free fromobscurations, where the basic space of phenomena and wisdom become inseparablymerged. Praise of the Basic Space of Phenomena states:The residence of great Vishnu,And that one, the Highest Pure Land, are beautiful.There, the three consciousnessesMerge as one: this I proclaim!If we take Shakyamuni as an example, from time immemorial, he attainedenlightenment in Highest Pure Land and then served sentient beings in four ways.Thus, after this realm of Endurance formed, he appeared in relation to thespecific perceptions and interests of sentient beings. He first appeared toattain enlightenment in the Highest Heaven of the form realm and had the godsassemble. Then he demonstrated the attainment of enlightenment in this world,the Land of Jambu, at Vajra Seat. The Journey to Langka Discourse states:After he left the pure heavens,The authentic Buddha attained enlightenmentIn the pleasant place called “Highest.”An emanation of that buddha attained enlightenment here.The certain teachers are the five chiefs of the wisdom clans—for example, thebuddhas Illuminator, Unmoving, Source of Jewels, Infinite Light, andAccomplisher of Aims—wisdom bodies of perfect rapture beautifully adorned withthe thirty-two signs and eighty marks of physical perfection.The thirty-two signs of physical perfection are listed in Returning the Buddha’sKindness Discourse:They are (1) flat and full soles; (2) a thousand-spoked wheel design on thesoles; (3) long and narrow fingers; (4) round and full heels; (5) connectivewebs between the fingers; (6) soft and supple hands and feet; (7) calves roundand tapered, like those of the sovereign among deer, the inaya antelope; (8)inconspicuous ankles; (9) long arms, that his fingertips reach the knees; (10)genitals retracted that they do not appear, like those of the king of horses;(11) limbs complete, like those of a banyan tree; (12) body hair lies flat,curling upward; (13) each hair curls clockwise; (14) body color, like moltengold, is beautiful to behold; (15) continual radiance that extends one arm span;(16) soft skin with no perspiration or unpleasant odor; (17) full in sevenplaces; (18) a lionlike torso; (19) well-tapered forearms and biceps; (20) evenand full collarbone; (21) a well-defined demarcation between the upper and lowerbody; (22) a complete set of forty teeth; (23) even teeth equal in size; (24)white teeth; (25) a full jaw like a lion, king of beasts; (26) a tongue thatfinds everything delicious; (27) a protuberance of flesh on the crown of thehead; (28) a long, wide tongue; (29) the melodic voice of Brahma; (30) beautifuleyes as if deep blue in color; (31) beautiful eyelashes, like those of thefinest cow; (32) and a curl of white hair between the eyebrows.The “seven places” mentioned [in number 17 above] are listed in The FlowerOrnament Discourse:His two insteps are extremely high, very well rounded and wide; his joints donot show; they are very attractive; and they are beautiful to behold.These attributes apply to his two insteps, the backs of his two hands, his twoshoulders, and the nape of the neck—the seven places.Thus, the seven places—the four backs of the hands and the insteps, the twoshoulders, and the nape—have six features, such as fullness and height.The Ornament of Manifest Realization provides another list of the thirty-twosigns:These are the Buddha’s thirty-two signs of physical perfection:(1) His hands and feet are marked by wheel designs, (2) his feet are like thoseof a tortoise,(3) His fingers and toes are joined by connective webs,(4) His arms and his legs are soft and youthful,(5) His body’s seven places are elevated,(6) His fingers are long, (7) his heels are wide, (8) his body is large andstraight,(9) His ankles do not protrude, (10) his hair curls upward,(11) His calves are like those of a black inaya antelope, (12) his arms are longand beautiful,(13) His genitals are retracted, thus well concealed,(14) His skin is golden, (15) his skin is fine,(16) Each strand of his body’s hair curls clockwise,(17) A hair curls on his forehead, (18) his torso is lionlike,(19) His shoulders are rounded, (20) his shoulders are broad,(21) Even bad-tasting food seems most delicious to his tongue,(22) His body is like a banyan tree, as wide in arm span as it is tall,(23) His crown has a protuberance, (24) his tongue is long and beautiful,(25) He has the voice of Brahma, (26) his jaw is lionlike,(27) His teeth are very white, (28) there are no gaps between his teeth, (29)his teeth are even,(30) And complete—forty in number,(31) His eyes are dark blue, (32) with lashes like those of the finest cow.The Buddha’s eighty excellent marks of physical perfection are as follows.

TheOrnament of the Appearance of Wisdom Discourse states:An inconceivable number of supreme bodhisattvas who have reached awakening’stenth stage completely surround the Honored One, the supreme body of perfectrapture.The certain doctrine is the turning of the wheel of the teaching, exclusivelythat of the great way. The same text states:. . . fully turns the limitless, inconceivable wheel of unsurpassable teachings.The Aspirations of the Bodhisattva Loving Kindness states:Great Illuminator, the transcendent buddha,Emits light, like the rising sun.From his mouth pours the nectar of speech,To cure the sick throughout the three worlds.The body of perfect rapture is eternally present, thus the time of itsapparition is inconceivable. Entering the Middle Way states:To remain forever within the world until beings are liberated,The serene body, bright as a wish-fulfilling tree,Without thought, like a wish-fulfilling jewel—This wisdom body’s appearance is free from embellishments.The reason for this eternal presence is that the body of perfect rapture isitself inseparable from the body of ultimate enlightenment and shares itsessence. Thus, the body of perfect rapture is permanent because the body ofultimate enlightenment does not move or change and is naturally present andnoncomposite, and because beings to be spiritually guided can thereby producelimitless goodness until the end of the round of rebirth. The Highest Continuitystates:Since the lord of the doctrine has defeated the demons of deathAnd has no intrinsic essence, the Lord of the World is eternal.The Manifest Body of Enlightenment [3]Created manifest forms of enlightenment include statues and texts.Incarnate forms of enlightenment manifest in various forms to guide others.Supreme manifest bodies of enlightenment display the twelve acts of buddhas:(1) Descent from Joyous Heaven, (2) entering the womb, (3) birth,(4) Education in skills, (5) life with a circle of queens, (6) disenchantment,(7) Ascetic practices, (8) travel to the place of awakening, (9) defeat of thedemons’ armies,(10) Enlightenment, (11) turning the wheel of the doctrine, and (12)transcendence of sorrow.There are three wisdom bodies of manifest enlightenment. The Ornament of theDiscourses states:Enlightenment’s manifest bodiesProvide significant means for complete liberationAs artistic creations, as corporeal beings or things, and, likewise,As emanations of sublime awakening.Therefore, manifest wisdom bodies that are artistic creations include craftedstatues, painting’s designs, sacred texts, and religious monuments, all of whichmanifestly increase positive influence among beings. Corporeal manifest wisdombodies appear to guide beings in appropriate ways, such as kings, governmentofficials, men, women, jewels, mansions, supreme medicines, and paths. Suprememanifest bodies demonstrate the twelve acts of buddhas in the world, as follows.First, descent from Joyous Heaven: On completion of three incalculable eons ofgoodness and wisdom’s cultivation, the Bodhisattva, the future Buddha, tookbirth in Joyous Heaven as the god Sacred White Crown. There, the gods’ musicmade this sound:You are endowed with the power of recollection and have gathered abundant storesof goodness.Your infinite intellect radiates with sublime insight.Your mastery of power is incomparable; your creativity, vast:Please consider the prophecy of the previous Buddha Light Giver!With this encouragement, he saw five visions concerning his future rebirth: thecontinent—that of the place of his activity, Land of Jambu; the time—when humanlongevity extends to one hundred years; the caste of his birth—that of thearistocracy; his father—King Shuddhodana; and his mother—Mayadevi. These two arethe parents of the thousand buddhas of this eon.He then taught one hundred and eight gateways to the truth called “CompletePurification of Death and Transmigration,” and the gods developed faith in him.He taught such instructions as “Faith is the gateway that illuminates truth, toclarify minds that have been sullied.”Second, entering the womb: He manifested as a silver-colored six-tuskedelephant, covered by a golden net. On the full moon of the third spring month,under the constellation Saga, during his mother’s purification practice, heentered her womb. There, he emanated a celestial palace and performed acts toaid infinite numbers of beings.Third, birth: In Lumbini Garden, after ten months of gestation, he appearednaturally from under his mother’s right ribcage. The gods and the king of nagaswashed him; Brahma and Indra picked him up with a white silk cloth. He tookseven steps in each of the four directions, saying, “In this world, I amsupreme!” A brahmin asked to name him foretold, “If he does not renounce homelife, he will become a universal monarch; if he does, he will become a buddha.”He then offered him the name Prince Sarvatasiddha (Accomplisher of All Aims).When he demonstrated mastery over the Shakya youths, he was also called MightyOne of the Shakyas (Shakyamuni).Fourth, education in skills: In the presence of such teachers as the grammarianVishvamitra and Krmivarman, he perfected his skill in writing, archery, andgymnastics. During that time, the Shakya youths held a competition. Devadattakilled an elephant with a blow from his palm and Nanda took the corpse outsidethe town by its tail. The Bodhisattva raised the corpse with one of his toes andflung it beyond seven city ramparts, seven trenches, and seven lines of trees,to a pit that became known as Elephant Pit. Likewise, in the archerycompetition, for the targets of seven iron drums, a line of seven trees, andseven iron lattices, Devadatta hit one; Nanda, five; and the Bodhisattva, all ofthem. From the arrow’s point of impact sprung forth water of eight qualities,which became known as the Arrow Spring.Fifth, life with a circle of queens: He took residence in the palace with anentourage of sixty thousand queens—twenty thousand with the Shakya maiden Gopa,twenty thousand with Mrigaga, and twenty thousand with Yasodhara. At that time,he was encouraged by words that rang from the gods’ cymbals, such as, “When youhave seen sentient beings filled with suffering, you will become for beings alord defender and sanctuary of refuge!”Sixth, disenchantment: Then at the city’s four corners, he witnessed thesufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. He considered the positivequalities of liberation and decided to renounce home life. Soldiers guarded thefour gates of the palace to prevent his departure. However when he mounted thehorse named Kantaka, the four great divine kings lifted the horse by its hoovesover the walls, and the Bodhisattva reached the religious monument called thePure, where he cut his hair and renounced home life. Following this, in Rajgirunder the guidance of Udraka Ramaputra, he demonstrated the actualization of themeditative composure of nothingness; and in Vaishali, under the guidance ofArada Kamala, the meditative states below the pinnacle of existence.Seventh, ascetic practice: He traveled to the banks of the Nairanjana River,where he engaged in ascetic practice for six years. During the first two yearshe ate a grain of rice each day; during the middle two years, a grain of sesame;and during the last two, a drop of water. Having arisen from meditation, hejourneyed to search for the place where he could enter the vajra-like meditativestate. On his path he met Sujata, a merchant’s daughter, who served him milkfrom five hundred cows, boiled eight times. On drinking this, his body glowedwith a golden hue and he recited a prayer of dedication of the goodness of hergift of food.Eighth, travel to Heart of Awakening: On his way, the Bodhisattva met thegrass-seller Sottiya, who offered him kusha grass the color of a peacock’s neck.He accepted the gift and proceeded to the Vajra Seat and the tree of awakening,which were given limitless decorations by the gods who surrounded Heart ofAwakening. He took his seat and made a firm vow,On this seat, this body may dry up,My skin and collection of bones may break,Yet until I reach awakening, difficult to attain in many eons,I will not move my body from this seat!Ninth, defeat of malevolent forces: From the circle between his eyebrows, theBodhisattva emanated a light called “complete defeat of the demons” that filledevery abode of demons. In dreams, the demons’ king saw one hundred and eightomens, such as a falling auspicious vase and a broken victory banner. The demonrealized that the Bodhisattva was going to attain enlightenment. He went toVajra Seat and declared, “The time has not yet come for you to reachenlightenment!” to which the Bodhisattva replied, “Because I have completed mycultivation of the two stores of goodness and wisdom during three incalculableeons, the time for me to attain enlightenment has come. You, however, havebecome king of the demons by having made just a single gift or offering.” Thedemon said, “I can bear witness to my gifts and offerings! You, however, youhave no witness at all!” The Bodhisattva replied, “Today, may the earth be mywitness!” Earth Goddess appeared immediately and said, “This child ofenlightened heritage has indeed completed many stores of goodness and wisdom. Ican count the number of dust motes in the circle of the Earth, yet I am unableto calculate the number of his own heads and limbs he has sacrificed forsentient beings!”The demon, shamed, left for his residence and returned, leading a hundredmillion soldiers. Their great torrent of weapons fell toward the Bodhisattva;however, his settling in evenness within the meditative state of love caused theweapons to turn into a rain of flowers and their horrendous noise to becomesweet songs. The daughters of the demons who tried to seduce the Bodhisattvaturned into crones, then begged his forgiveness.Tenth, manifest awakening: He then settled in evenness within the vajra-likemeditative state. Just before the drum beat at dawn, he actualized themeditative states of knowledge of dissipation of the mental afflictions andknowledge of nonarising of suffering and thereby attained three states ofawareness: enlightenment, awakening, and realization. At that moment, the groundin the ten directions shook. Seven days thereafter he spoke his first auspiciouswords to the merchant Trapusha and to Bhallika.Eleventh, turning the wheel of the doctrine: The god Brahma offered the Buddha agold, thousand-spoked wheel; and the god Shakra offered him a white conch thatswirled clockwise, with the request that he turn the wheel of the doctrine, arequest he accepted. The Buddha traveled to the region of Varanasi where onethousand jeweled thrones appeared. He circumambulated the first three and tookhis seat upon the fourth. He taught the five excellent individuals and eightythousand gods by turning the wheel of the sacred doctrine of the four nobletruths. Once the five excellent individuals directly realized the truth, theygained the result of arhat.Then at Vulture Peak, the Buddha taught bodhisattvas, great hearers, and others,by turning the wheel of the absence of self-existent characteristics. Then, insuch locations as the lands of gods and nagas, he turned the final wheel, thatof the ultimate, definitive meaning.In the first enunciation of the doctrine, he taught in relation to the levels ofunderstanding of beginners, mainly through renunciation and antidotes, toencourage disengagement from the round of rebirth. The middle enunciation wasgiven in order to prevent attachment to spiritual practices, such as therenunciation of the round of rebirth on the path of antidotes. The finalenunciation expressed directly the basic character of phenomena. The Buddha alsotaught the three collections, the three trainings, and the three ways ofspiritual development.Twelfth, demonstration of the transcendence of sorrow: Finally, at the age ofeighty or eighty-two, at the village of Kushinagar, by a pair of sal trees, theBuddha passed beyond sorrow.Until the age of twenty-nine, the Buddha lived at the king’s palace; he finishedhis six years of ascetic practice at thirty-five; from the age of thirty-sixuntil forty-two, he taught the doctrine of the four noble truths; fromforty-three until seventy-two, he taught the doctrine of the absence ofself-existent characteristics; and from seventy-two until eighty-two, he taughtthe ultimate doctrine of definitive meaning.After the age of thirty-five, the Buddha spent one year in each of the followinglocations: the place of the wheel of the doctrine, Vaishali, Pandubhumi, theheavens of the gods, the wilderness, Uchirayici, Venuvana, Vairata, Balaghna,Kaushambi, and Kapilavastu—a total of eleven years. Then he spent two years inIndrachailaguha, three years in Bhaishajyavana, five years in the town ofRajgir, and twenty-four years in Kosala, so it is said. According to thisaccount, the Buddha lived a total of eighty years. On the fifteenth lunar day ofthe last spring month of the Buddha’s eightieth year, he passed completelybeyond sorrow.The Buddha’s cremation pyre ignited by itself. His relics were divided intoeight portions and distributed. One portion was given to each of the followinggroups: the Mallas of Kushinagar, the Mallas of Papa, the aristocratic clanMahapuluka of Calakalpa, the brahmins of Vaishnavadvipa, the Shakyas ofKapilavastu, the Lichavis of Vaishali, the brahmin clan Bheda of Magadha, andthe vase that had contained the relics, to the brahmins Drona and Sama.The ashes from the cremation were collected by the brahmin Nayagrodhaja, whotook them and built a large monument to contain them.The Buddha’s fourth canine tooth was taken by the nagas of the town Ravana totheir homeland. The third tooth was offered to the ogre king of Kalinga. Thesecond was given as the share of Ajatashatru, King of Magadha. He put thattooth, along with all the small relics that had multiplied from it, into theLotus Garlanded Religious Monument. It is said that those relics were brought toTibet, where they now rest in the White Religious Monument at Samyé Monastery.Lord of gods Shakra took the first tooth to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. TheHighest Continuity states:The great compassionate one knows the worldAnd sees all worlds:Without moving from the body of ultimate enlightenment,Various natural manifestationsTake manifest rebirth as incarnate beings,Move from the Joyous Heaven,Enter the womb, are born,Become skilled in arts,Enjoy pleasure with an entourage of queens,Become disenchanted, practice asceticism,Travel to Heart of Awakening,Defeat hordes of demons, reach complete awakening,Turn the wheel of the doctrine, And transcend suffering.They demonstrate these acts in impure realmsUntil the end of existence.The Content of the Path of No Further Training—Wisdom [B]This section has three parts: (1) a general classification of wisdom, (2) thenature of each wisdom, and (3) wisdom, and how it knows objects of knowledge.A General Classification of Wisdom [1]The content of enlightenment, wisdom, is twofold—knowledge of the natureOf the basic space of phenomena, free from the extremes of formulation ofobjects of knowledge;And precise knowledge of the multiplicity of phenomena in the round of rebirthand transcendent states.This classification is based only upon enlightenment’s wisdom. The essence ofthe classification is twofold: wisdom of the knowledge of the nature of realityas it is and wisdom of the knowledge of multiplicity. The first is manifestknowledge of reality’s essence, free from any formulation of objects ofknowledge, such as cause and result. This is designated “wisdom of the basicspace of phenomena.”The second wisdom, of the knowledge of multiplicity, has three parts: essence,classification, and cause. First, its essence is manifest knowledge of allobjects of knowledge, such as cause and effect, to be like a magical display.Second, the classification of the wisdom of knowledge of multiplicity has fourparts: mirrorlike wisdom, the wisdom of evenness, the wisdom of discernment, andall-accomplishing wisdom.Third, these four forms of wisdom have two causes: causal antidotes, whichremove obscurations, and natural causes, which are removed. First, on the fourpaths of training, you hear many teachings, retain them, meditate on theevenness of self and others, teach disciples you guide according to theirconnection to the teachings, and you accompany this with serving beings. Thesecausal antidotes purify the stains that obscure the wisdoms naturally present inyou and facilitate their accomplishment.For the second, natural causes, from the perspective of appearances, removal ofthe obscurations which cover the naturally present wisdoms within you is termed“transformation.” When the eight bands of consciousness of periods of impureexperience, along with their support, the storehouse of all dualisticexperience, are reversed, wisdom arises. For example, purification of thestorehouse of all dualistic experience produces the wisdom of the basic space ofphenomena. Entering the Three Wisdom Bodies Discourse states:The dissolution of the storehouse of all dualistic experience into basic spaceproduces the wisdom of the basic space of phenomena. The dissolution of thestorehouse consciousness into basic space produces mirrorlike wisdom. Thedissolution of the mental faculty’s consciousness into basic space produces thewisdom of evenness. The dissolution of the afflicted mental function into basicspace produces the wisdom of discernment. The dissolution of the consciousnessof the senses’ five gates into basic space produces all-accomplishing wisdom.The Nature of Each Wisdom [2]Four wisdoms—mirrorlike, evenness,Discerning, and all-accomplishing—are explained through their essence,complement, and function.Mirrorlike wisdom is as follows. Its essence is endowed with five positivequalities: It is continuous, since it is not constrained by the partiality ofclinging to an “I.” It is not limited by place—knowledge that an objectivedomain exists does not prevent knowledge of another elsewhere. It is not limitedby time—this wisdom has no impermanence, transition, or change, and does notdwell within the relative three times of past, present, and future, thus it isinconceivable and constant. It is not limited by mental focus, because thiswisdom has knowledge of every phenomenon. It is not limited by objectiveforms—this wisdom is the knowledge of the existence of an object of knowledgeand does not depend on the arising of its objective appearance.The three other wisdoms complement mirrorlike wisdom. The Ornament of theDiscourses states:Mirrorlike wisdom does not move.Just these three wisdoms are based on it:The wisdom of evenness, the wisdom of discernment,And all-accomplishing wisdom.The function of mirrorlike wisdom is as follows. When a face meets a mirror, areflection arises. Likewise, when this wisdom meets beings to be spirituallyguided, the wisdom body of perfect rapture and the three other wisdoms ariselike a reflection. Thus this wisdom forms the basis for the manifest body’semanations. The same text states:Since it is the basic cause of all wisdoms,It is like wisdom’s supreme source.Enlightenment’s perfect rapture itself,It is the source of the reflected wisdoms of the manifest body.The essence of the wisdom of evenness comprehends everything in evenness, freefrom the two extremes of the round of rebirth and transcendent states. The sametext states:What is called the wisdom of evennessIs to enter nonstatic peace.Supreme love and supreme nondual compassion complement it. Its function is theactual manifestation of wisdom bodies that have form consistent with theinterests of beings to be guided. The same text states:Always endowed with supreme loveAnd compassion,It definitely demonstrates enlightenment’s wisdom bodiesAccording to sentient beings’ interests.I consider that mirrorlike wisdom provides the basis for the arising of thebodies of enlightenment, whereas the wisdom of evenness creates theirpresentation to the beings they guide.The essence of the wisdom of discernment is the attainment of the mastery toteach, the unhindered wisdom that knows all phenomena. The same text states:The wisdom of discernmentIs never impeded by any phenomena.Countless positive qualities, such as meditative states and retention,complement it. The same text states:It is just like a treasureOf meditative states and retention.Its function is to demonstrate within the enlightened being’s circle ofdisciples the wisdom body’s varied forms of spiritual wealth, producing a rainof teachings. The same text states:This wisdom demonstrates all wealthIn all circles of an entourage.To dispel all doubts,It produces a plentiful rain of sublime teachings.The essence of all-accomplishing wisdom is accomplishment of the manifestationof infinite emanations to serve sentient beings in myriad ways. The same textstates:In all realms, throughout a variety of lands,All-accomplishing wisdomProduces infinite, inconceivable manifestationsTo serve all sentient beings.Its function is inconceivable service for beings to be spiritually guided. TheOrnament of the Discourses states:Know that the acts forever accomplishedBy enlightenment’s manifestations—All their varieties, numbers, and realms—Are inconceivable.Wisdom, and How It Knows Objects of Knowledge [3]This section has two parts: (1) refutation of misguided explanations of wisdomand (2) the correct explanation of wisdom.Refutation of Misguided Explanations of Wisdom [a]This section has three parts: refutation of misguided explanations of wisdomfrom (1) the middle way tradition, (2) the mind only tradition, and (3) thematerialist tradition.Refutation of Misguided Explanations of Wisdom from the Middle Way Tradition [i]Some middle way philosophers contend that enlightenment has no wisdom.Some middle way philosophers contend that enlightenment has no wisdom, andtherefore, no knowledge from wisdom, since objects of knowledge are formulationsand enlightenment is free from such formulations. Further, they claim that sinceignorance pervades awareness, once ignorance (the pervading factor) iscounteracted, awareness (the pervaded object) is likewise counteracted. Enteringthe Middle Way states:The wisdom body reveals the cessation of mind.Does this prove their contention? No, it does not. From the perspective of thebody of ultimate enlightenment (the emptiness aspect), neither the presence northe absence of wisdom exists. To contend it exists can be refuted; the beliefthat it doesn’t exist can be equally refuted. Therefore, the contention thatwisdom does not exist is inadmissible.From the perspective of the wisdom bodies that have form (the appearanceaspect), once beings to be guided appear, enlightenment’s deeds in their servicenecessarily appear and, therefore, wisdoms must appear. Further, althoughphilosophies’ conceptual terminology, such as objects of knowledge and theirknower, are formulations, objects considered to appear without any suchdesignated terminology are not considered formulations. Therefore, to deny thatenlightenment has wisdom is incorrect because even worldly persons believe this.Conformity with the World Discourse states:What the worldly accept as existent, I too set forth as existent.Awareness is the foundation for ignorance, not an object pervaded by ignorance.Thus, awareness is not counteracted when ignorance is counteracted, just as theland upon which a house was built remains after the building is destroyed. Ithas been said that the body of ultimate enlightenment is actualized byawareness: “The wisdom body reveals the cessation of mind,” a source they alsoaccept. When mind ceases, wisdom does not cease but increases in excellence andis always present.Further, upon what basis does mind cease? If it is contended that its continuityends to become like space, that belief resembles the hedonists’ view. Therefore,mind (synthesized as mental states, the eight consciousnesses, and thestorehouse of all dualistic experience) ceases on the ground of the wisdom ofawareness. A Commentary to “Entering the Middle Way” states:The wisdom of unsurpassable deeds, which further any being’s welfare, has beenattained by the Honored One only in the Highest Pure Realm.Thus, this quotation affirms that the writer Chandrakirti believes thatenlightenment has wisdom.Refutation of Misguided Explanations of Wisdom from the Mind Only Tradition [ii]Some mind only philosophers contend that knowledge does not include appearances.Some mind only philosophers do not accept that the wisdom of enlightenmentincludes knowledge of objects in the external world. They contend that if wisdomknows appearances, it must involve dualistic experience; and they furthercontend that a thesis of wisdom’s knowledge functioning without appearanceswould be absurd. Their belief is incorrect. To them I reply, “Your contentiondenies omniscient wisdom: in your view, wisdom does not know objects in theexternal world and you analyze it and its powers of cognition as you wouldordinary consciousness, according to whether an appearance is present or not.”Refutation of Misguided Explanations of Wisdom from the Materialist Tradition[iii]Some materialist philosophers contend that wisdom sees delusion’s perceptions.Some materialist philosophers of the two truths contend that delusion’sperceptions of the impure round of rebirth appear directly to the Buddha’swisdom as self-existing phenomena. They consider this itself as the Buddha’swisdom of knowledge of multiplicity. If these are not known, the impureenvironment and beings cannot be objects of knowledge, since they are not seenby omniscient wisdom. As a general principle, what enlightenment does not see isnot an object of knowledge. Therefore, although the impure is seen, the faultsof its delusion do not alter the wisdom that sees them.Such is their belief, but it is incorrect. The wisdom of enlightenment aside, itis taught that even at awakening’s three pure stages, the consciousnesses of thefive gates of the senses have been transformed so that bodhisattvas on thosestages have mastery of pure lands. Since enlightenment is free from thedefilements of delusion’s perceptions, it is mistaken to contend that within itsperception, delusion’s appearances ever appear.Moreover, some believe that the wisdom of enlightenment can know pureenvironments and beings, but for it to know the impure environment and beings isimpossible, since those appearances are created by sentient beings’ mentalafflictions and karma and because in enlightenment all impure appearances havebeen transformed into pure appearances.This contention is also incorrect. The wisdom of enlightenment is eitheromniscient wisdom or it is not. If it is, we must reject the contention that itcannot know the beings’ deluded perceptions; if it is not, this undermines thenotion of a wisdom of enlightenment.Therefore, all these systems of thought are incorrect, since they are basedeither solely in consideration of what corresponds to their view, or withoutconsideration of what contradicts it.The Correct Explanation of Wisdom [b]This section has two parts: (1) how wisdom sees objects of knowledge and (2)refutation of arguments.How Wisdom Sees Objects of Knowledge [i]In enlightened beings’ self-manifest experience, personal deluded perceptionshave been purified so they do not see them.However, they know entirely the causes and results that appear in the deludedperceptions of ordinary beings’ experience of reality as other-manifest,Like the fable of someone awake who enters the dream path of a sleeping person.They know the nature of reality as it is,They know manifestly the illusory nature of phenomena,And they know the three times unobstructedly and instantaneously.The correct explanation is as follows: From the perspective of enlightenedbeings’ self-manifest experience, since all delusion has been totally purified,they do not see even an iota of delusion’s perceptions. Delusion has beenforever relinquished and perceptions based on it do not exist. In relation todelusion, the delusion-based experience of the entirety of reality as beingother-manifest (that is, sourced and existent externally), enlightened beingsknow how each unenlightened being’s mistaken perceptions arise, along with thoseperceptions’ causes and effects, as if an amla fruit were placed in the palm oftheir hand. In a single instant, they simultaneously know the self-manifest andother-manifest experience of self and others, since this constitutes omniscientwisdom. The Two Truths states:In even a single instant of knowledgeWisdom pervades all configurations of objects of knowledge.The meaning of these two aspects of wisdom can be understood through a singleexample: In a sublime mansion of jewels, ornamented with infinite wealth, twobrothers slept. The elder brother, who had gone to sleep first, awoke with thepower of clairvoyance to know the other’s mind. He saw that his younger brotherhad fallen asleep and was dreaming of the various forms of happiness andsuffering related to each of the six kinds of beings’ deluded perceptions. Atthat moment, it was impossible to wake him, yet to allow him to remain sleepingwas of no use. Therefore, when the younger brother dreamed of taking birth, as agod for example, and experienced happiness or suffering, the older brother wouldapproach him, in whatever manifestation was appropriate—such as a noblepractitioner or as a brahmin, as a man or as a woman, as a buddha, a hearer, asolitary sage, a bodhisattva, or an ordinary individual. He would presentspiritual teachings, such as, “Alas! All composite phenomena are impermanent!They have no core! They are not true existence! These deluded perceptions arefalse: do not be attached to their reality! Apply yourself to the teachings!”Due to this counsel, the younger brother rejected corrupting acts and engaged inennobling acts. Thus, during repeated lifetimes in his seeming experience, heenjoyed the happiness of the higher realms and was born as a person who engagedin spiritual teachings. Thus his immediate circumstances were happy. As hissleep thereby became lighter, he understood the round of rebirth to be false andwith this realization, he awoke. He saw that he had not moved from his bed, thatwhat he had experienced had been dreams, and that his older brother had guidedhim through having sent out emanations. Although there was no difference betweenthe two brothers, for the period that one slept and the other was awake, thereseemed to be a momentary qualitative difference. The two brothers laughed.Exactly as this fable relates, buddhas and sentient beings are equal masters inthe palace of essential wisdom. However, their momentary differences can becompared to whether or not they have woken from the sleep of transitoryobscuration.The wisdom of enlightenment knows objects of knowledge in two ways. First,knowledge of the nature of reality is explained as follows. Within the essenceof all phenomena of the round of rebirth and transcendent states,enlightenment’s wisdom severs every formulation, such as arising or cessation,and misinterpretation due to clinging to things as having intrinsiccharacteristics. Wisdom then directly comprehends that those objects ofknowledge, including their nature, lack even the slightest substance which canbe an object of focus. This is called knowledge of the nature of reality. Adiscourse states:To not see anything at all is to see the nature of reality.Second, knowledge of multiplicity is explained as follows. The wisdom ofenlightenment does not move from settling in evenness, yet has manifestknowledge of every object of knowledge as illusions. This is called knowledge ofmultiplicity. A discourse states:The frame of reference of omniscience is nonsubstantiality.However, this knowledge is not like that of the sensory consciousnesses, inwhich each sense grasps its own domain. Instead, one aspect of consciousness canknow all subjects. The Flower Ornament Discourse states:The unsurpassable wisdom of the victorsIs aware of all meanings in a single instant.It is not the case that the objects of knowledge of the past, present, andfuture are known in sequential order: they are known simultaneously. TheOrnament of the Discourses states:One ray from the sunIlluminates the world;Likewise, all objects of knowledgeAppear simultaneously in enlightenment’s wisdom.These objects of knowledge are seen without movement from the ongoing state ofsettling in evenness; therefore, the postmeditative state has no intrinsiccharacteristics—distraction, along with its habitual patterns, has beenrelinquished.Refutation of Arguments [ii]Although no objects of knowledge exist, they dwell within the sphere of wisdom’sactivity.Although things are not real, buddhas know them to exist as false.If one contends that since no object—a nature of reality—is possible within theknowledge of the nature of reality, a wisdom that sees it is impossible. TheVajra Cutter Discourse states:The nature of reality is not an object of knowledgeAnd cannot be known.The Buddha spoke this to indicate that the nature of reality is not an object ofknowledge with an existent essence. Nevertheless, the nature ofreality—inexpressible, inconceivable, beyond extremes—is known, since it is thedomain of the wisdom of individual indwelling awareness. Rahula’s Praise to theMother of the Buddhas states:The perfection of sublime insight—indescribable, inconceivable, andinexpressible,Is neither born nor ceases, like the essence of space.It is the domain of the wisdom of individual indwelling awareness:Mother of the victors of the three times, to you I bow.Some contend that since the perceptual domains of the wisdom of the sight ofmultiplicity—impure domains possessed of intrinsic characteristics—cannotpossibly exist, a wisdom that sees them is impossible. However, even though suchdomains are unreal, they are known to exist as false: there are no possiblelimits to objects of knowledge, to the number of sentient beings, or to thebeginning or end of the round of rebirth. To address the second point of thatcontention (that the wisdom of seeing those domains is impossible), we believethat enlightenment’s wisdom knows the extent of possible objects of knowledge.However, what is not possible is not an object of knowledge and is not seen,like horns on a rabbit.A Commentary to “The Highest Continuity” states, “Although there is nobeginning, there is an end.” This means that when those who attain the purestate have purified future mental afflictions, they are endowed with perfectomniscience.The Deeds, Enlightened Activity [C]Until the end of the round of rebirth, enlightened activity’s timely deedsWork in skillful, appropriate ways to guide others.They aid beings effortlessly, as shown clearly by nine metaphors.To all fortunate persons, enlightened activity appears instantaneously, like thesun,Teaching disciples according to their karmic perceptions.Those without a karmic connection hear nothing, like deaf persons.From the ongoing wisdom body of rapture, manifest forms of enlightenment,related to beings’ interests, diffuse uninterruptedly for as long as the roundof rebirth endures. The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:Likewise, we believe that their activity continues uninterruptedlyFor as long as the round of rebirth endures.What is the nature of enlightened activity? Buddhas act with knowledge of theinnate constituent enlightenment of sentient beings, how beings can be guided,the activity of skillful means, and without deviation from the appropriate timefor their deeds. How do they undertake spontaneous activity? This can beunderstood through nine metaphors. The Highest Continuity states:Like Indra; a drum; a cloud;Brahma; the sun; a sovereign, precious wish-fulfilling jewel;An echo; space; and the earth—whoever works effortlessly for the welfare ofothers until existence endsHas the enlightened heritage of practitioners.The likeness of the Lord of Gods (Indra) shown on a jewel;The perfect counsel, like a divine drum;The master’s masses of clouds of knowledge and supreme lovePervade infinite numbers of beings, up to the summit of existence.Like Brahma, not moving from uncontaminated places,Emanations manifest in myriad forms.Like the sun, wisdom’s illumination shines widely.Wisdom mind is like a pure wish-fulfilling jewel.The victors’ wisdom speech,Like an echo, has no letters.Their wisdom body is like space—All-pervading, formless, and permanent.Enlightenment’s ground,Like the earth,Is the foundation in every circumstanceFor beings’ medicine of positive qualities.Like the sun’s infinite reflections in containers of water, this spontaneousenlightened activity appears simultaneously wherever there is the good fortuneof beings’ innate enlightened constituent. These appearances of enlightenedactivity, such as the Buddha’s teaching, consist of the individual karmicperceptions of beings to be guided. The same text states:Within the heavens, the sound of the divine drumArises from the gods’ own karma.Likewise, in the world, the Sage’s teachingArises from your own karma.Further, for example, like deaf persons who cannot hear an echo, persons withoutthe stores of karma to see the Buddha or to hear his teaching will not see orhear it. The same text states:Those without earsCannot hear faint sounds,And even those with divine earsCannot hear everything.Likewise, the finest teachings—The domain of subtle wisdom—Can enter the ears of the fewWhose minds harbor no mental afflictions.THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATH OF NO FURTHER TRAINING [III][05_toc-title.html#sec-39]This chapter has three parts: (1) the special renunciation of the path of nofurther training, (2) the special realization of the path of no furthertraining, and (3) the special qualities of the path of no further training.The Special Renunciation of the Path of No Further Training [A]The special renunciation is the purification of the two obscurations, with theirrelated habitual patterns.On the path of no further training, the two obscurations, along with all theirrelated habitual patterns, are relinquished. The Ornament of the Discoursesstates:The Sage is definitely liberated from all obscurations.The Special Realization of the Path of No Further Training [B]The special realization is the pure vision of all phenomena.The Middle-Length Version of the Mother of Sublime Insight states:There are no phenomena concerning which the transcendent buddhas are notmanifestly, completely enlightened, none they do not see, or none they do notknow. They thoroughly know all phenomena correctly, manifestly, and exactly asthey are.The Special Qualities of the Path of No Further Training [C]The special qualities are the wheel of adornmentsAnd the sixty melodic qualities of the Buddha’s speech: soft, gentle,compelling,Agreeable, pure, faultless, clear, sweet-sounding, pleasing, and calming—thefirst ten.Worthwhile, unassailable, not harsh, not inflexible, restrained,Pleasing to the ear, to the body, and to the mind; gladdening, and pleasing—thesecond ten.Never troubling, to be known, to be understood, clear, heartening,Exhilarating, comprehensive, informative, coherent, relevant—the third ten.Not repetitive, forceful, trumpeting, thundering, sounding, melodious, like adivine bird,Like the voice of Brahma, like a chakora bird, and like the lord of the gods’voice—the fourth ten.Like a drum, not vain, not degraded, consistent, not deficient,Not incomplete, not timid, not weak, completely joyous, and encompassing—thefifth ten.Not rigid, fluent, impressive, complete, satisfying, irreproachable,Reliable, not rushed, resounds everywhere, and supreme—the sixth ten.The sixty-four positive qualities of the wheel of inexhaustible adornments ofenlightened body, speech, and mind have been described above.35[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st35]The sixty melodic positive qualities of the Buddha’s speech, according to thepresentation found in Illumination of “The Perfection of Sublime Insight inTwenty Thousand Verses” and The Discourse Showing the Transcendent Buddhas’Inconceivable Mysteries, are as follows:(1) soft, since his speech presents the sources of ennobling acts of sentientbeings’ innate constituent enlightenment; (2) gentle, since it creates tangiblehappiness; (3) compelling, since its meaning is excellent; (4) reasonable, sincethe words are excellent; (5) pure, since it issues after the attainment of thetranscendent, unsurpassable state; (6) faultless, since it is free from thehabitual patterns of dormant mental afflictions; (7) completely clear, since itsterms and words are perfectly audible; (8) sweet-sounding, since it has thequality of force that overcomes the views of all nonbelievers’ negativeoutlooks;

(23) to be understood thoroughly, since it acts as the magnificentsupport for sublime insight that arises from reflection; (24) perfectly clear,since it teaches the instructions of the master without concealment; (25)heartening, since it inspires cheer in those who achieved their own aims; (26)exhilarating, since it is loved by those who have not achieved their own aims;(27) comprehensive, since it correctly teaches inconceivable phenomena;

(32) forceful like a lion’s roar, since it intimidates assembliesof nonbelievers; (33) like an elephant’s trumpeting, since it sounds widely;(34) like thunder, since it is profound; (35) like the voice of the lord ofnagas, since it is worthy to be retained; (36) like the melodies of the divinemusicians, since it is very sweet; (37) like the voice of the divine bird(kalavingka), since it is neither sharp nor repetitive; (38) like the voice ofBrahma, since it is audible at a great distance; (39) like the chakora bird’ssong, since it auspiciously precedes all accomplishment; (40) sweet-sounding,like the lord of the gods’ voice, since nothing surpasses it; (41) like a drum,since it precedes total victory over all demons and opposition; (42) not vain,since praises of it do not create any state of engulfing mental afflictions;(43) not degraded, since criticism does not weaken it; (44) consistent with allforms of grammar, since it conforms to the forms of Sanskrit and other grammars;(45) not deficient in linguistic form, since the Buddha does not speak inforgetfulness;

(59) resounding everywhere, since it can be heard the samefrom far or near; (60) supreme in every circumstance, since every worldlymeaning is represented in metaphors.These are the sixty melodic positive qualities of wisdom speech, the style ofthe melodic wisdom speech of the manifest wisdom body.Other sources list these sixty positive qualities of the Buddha’s speech asthese six: the voice of Brahma, cymbals, song and dance, a divine bird(kalavingka), thunder, and a pleasant sound. Each of these has ten aspects: itstimulates perception, creates awareness, is worthwhile, is not disharmonious,is very profound, responds to beings’ hopes and needs, is unassailable byanything or anyone, is pleasing to hear, is not disturbed, and is very clear.Another source has the sixty positive qualities as the following ten eachrelated to six circumstances: a very strong voice, fully pervasive, quicklyunderstandable, resolves doubts, makes the auditor think that the Buddha seeshim or her alone, is timely, is relevant in all circumstances, inspires focusedintent, is encompassing, and subdues everyone.This completes the explanation of the cause-based way of the transcendentperfections.CONCLUDING VERSES AND REMARKSThe body of ultimate enlightenment of supreme exaltation abides withoutformulations.The wisdom body rapture of supreme clarity blazes with the marks and signs ofthe Buddha’s physical perfection.The manifest wisdom body of supreme goodness appears in forms to guide others inappropriate ways.The glorious essence wisdom body dwells in pervasive inseparability.The illumination of supreme wisdom has neither bounds nor center.The positive qualities of the supreme spontaneous state are inconceivable.Enjoyment of the supreme unchanging state flows continually.Manifestations of supreme acts are inexhaustible.The supreme miraculous wisdom body exceeds measure.The supreme wisdom speech of Brahma’s voice defies distance.The supreme wisdom mind, beyond bounds, cannot be veiled nor made clearer.The supreme highest result is sublime awakening.This concludes the commentary to “The Result of the Middle Way,” Book 10 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall ways of spiritual development.

It presents the place,teacher, teaching, and persons who received it.It elucidates the distinct subjects of the bases, paths, and results of thethree Buddhist codes of conduct.Its general content describes the path’s view, meditation, and conduct.Exertion in hearing this text, and reflection and meditation upon it, leads toskill in teaching, debate, and composition, and to success;Your understanding, experience, and realization will increase, and you willswiftly accomplish the two goals.BOOK 1: DISCIPLESHIPThe extensive explanation of this text begins with “Discipleship.”The general characteristics of spiritual guides are the following:Because holy persons lead the worldly, they resemble everyone.Because they transcend the mundane, they are unlike anyone; they areoutstanding.Their acts and conduct are pure. They guide beings skillfully.Supreme wish-fulfilling spiritual masters are skillful,Are imbued with supreme compassion, and have mastered great treasuries ofdiscourses and tantras.They are vessels that cross the wide sea of existence,Guides for those who have entered the path, fine gems that dispel destitution,Rivers that extinguish the fires of karma and mental afflictions, clouds thatrain the teachings,Mighty divine drums that bring joy to all beings,Healers who cure the sicknesses of the three poisons,Bright lamps that dispel the darkness of ignorance, wish-fulfilling trees thatbestow happiness,Exquisite vases that yield everything desired, new dawns of universal love,Moons that ease heartache, and mines of the riches of every quality, like thewealth god Son of Renown.Respectfully rely upon such masters.Spiritual masters whose qualities are naturally complete are from good families,Have all senses intact, are considerate and modest,Are loving and compassionate, have vast sublime insight,And are restrained, erudite, patient, and not deceitful.Spiritual masters liberated from existence have turned their backs on commonhuman life,Feel faint attachment to homeland, long-guarded wealth, and possessions,Believe in karma and its consequences, are circumspect in relation to ennoblingacts to adopt and corrupting acts to reject,And have abandoned hopes for this life. They accomplish what is very meaningfulfor the long term.Spiritual masters who know every subject of Buddhist culture are learned inphilosophical tenets’ words and meaning,Maintain exemplary view and conduct, and are never reprehensible in any way.They do not invent their own teachings but adhere to scripture and logic,Examine the capacities of students, and teach accordingly.Spiritual masters who preserve the lineage of accomplished masters have receivedthe aural lineage’s profound instructions.They hold the tradition; thus, they are skillful in accomplishing the two goals.They exert themselves in spiritual practice, have attained accomplishments, andare even able to transform others’ perceptions.They have inherited the discourses’ and tantras’ transmissions, and guard thetantric bonds purely.Spiritual masters have trained in the awakened mind and continually help others.The signs of having received blessing are that they are able to bless others’experience;They have experience of the view, meditation, and conduct and their results; andthey are proficient in the signs that indicate attainment of meditative heat.They are powerful, can eliminate all hindrances, and guide others skillfully.Connection to spiritual masters who reveal the ultimate meaning brings you tothe profound path.They introduce the essential meaning, the body of ultimate enlightenment, andreveal pith instructions to enrich that experience.Consummately realized, they accompany disciples to the abiding nature, theground of being.They skillfully transform any circumstance into the path and are masterful inliberating others’ streams of being.The expanse of their wisdom minds spans the sky; their meditative states shinebrilliantly like the sun;Their wisdom is deep as an ocean; and their nondual compassion flows like amighty river.Unmoved by distraction, like snow-covered mountains, they are as steadfast asmountains.Unsullied by existence, like lotuses, they dwell in equanimity like a parent.Replete with qualities like treasures, they lead beings like monarchs.For difficult beings, they surpass any buddha.Unworthy candidates to be rejectedHave poor faith, consideration, modesty, compassion, character,Nature, behavior, and fortune. Their acts and mental afflictions are coarse.They disregard ennobling acts and corrupting acts, vows and tantric bonds. Theirpositive influences are faint.They are very foolish, small-minded, difficult to please, bad tempered, andargumentative.They harbor the intent to sell to others the teachings they receive.The enormity of bad effects of not examining a prospective disciple harmsBuddhism.Fortunate disciples are endowed with strong faith, energy, and sublime insight.They exercise care, mindfulness, and thoughtfulness. They honor their vows andtantric bonds.They do not disobey commands; they are peaceful, disciplined, and loving.They are open-minded, mentally stable, and have strong devotion and pureperception.There are six purposes for remaining inseparable from spiritual masters and tocontinually rely upon them:Spiritual masters provide profound and lastingly useful advice.They relieve suffering by teaching discernment in relation to ennobling acts andwrongdoing.They open disciples’ eyes to sublime insight and illuminate the path to freedom.Only spiritual masters can provide the highest supportFor the swift cultivation of goodness and wisdom.Because spiritual masters give refuge from all the sufferings of life and themiserable existences,It is worthwhile to rely upon them as your foremost refuge.For those without qualities, spiritual masters cause ordinary and special noblequalitiesTo develop and to flourish.It is rare in this time of degeneration to find someone who surpasses spiritualmastersAs teachers of the deep and wide-ranging nectar of the Buddhist doctrine.In any country or region qualified spiritual masters live,Strive to find them as if searching for rare food or wealth.Whatever spiritual masters do—gently or forcefully, meaningful or not, major orminor—Is guided by their wisdom mind’s realization.Rely upon masters as you would, for example, ascetics, powerful guardians,warriors, rulers,Teachers, healers, or helpful companions.Offer without attachment food, clothing, material things, jewels,Grain, wealth, fine houses, fields, horses, vehicles,All your special wealth—your children, spouse, or servants;Sacred representations of wisdom body, speech, and mind; and the finestmedicine.Physically, bow, present offerings, and perform circumambulations. Do what youare asked on the masters’ behalf.Serve, wait upon, attend, and obey spiritual masters.Protect them from fire or water, ravines, wild animals, and enemies.Wrong physical behavior includes carelessness, disrespect, scowling,Frowning, clapping the hands, turning your side toward the master, stretchingthe arms or legs,Lying down, fighting, frivolity, playing games, spitting or cleaning your nose,Or stepping over the masters’ hair or clothes.Make requests with pleasant words, praise the masters,Use polite language, speak supportively of what the masters have said,Pray to them, relate the masters’ qualities and life stories to others,Answer honestly, take refuge, and examine your own speech.Wrong verbal behavior includes lies, slander, idle talk,Or using harsh language in the presence of spiritual masters, disobeying theircommands, and talking back.Mentally, remember the spiritual masters’ kindness and qualities.Develop the attitude that the masters, difficult to meet, are greater than theBuddha.When recalling their acts, tremble and cry.Consider that to see, hear, recall, or be touched by spiritual masters is a verymeaningful event.Wrong mental attitudes include lack of faith, wrong views, anger, criticalattention,Contempt, competitiveness, pride, and coveting. Renounce these acts.When the order arrives, “Devote yourself single-mindedly to meditationpractice!”Stay in seclusion, abandon all forms of busyness,And single-mindedly day and night raise the banner of essential spiritualpractice.Become past masters’ representative and actualize the fruit of accomplishment.Inconceivable numbers of benefits accrue from correct discipleship:Every fault, shortcoming, suffering, and weakness ends.A great treasure overflows with favorable qualities, talents, meditativeexperiences, and realization.You bring help and happiness to Buddhism and to beings.Misleading companions to be forsaken are described as follows:Befriending fools diverts you from the correct path.Deficient in knowledge, you unwittingly lead an ordinary, meaningless life.When you befriend the faithless and apathetic,You neglect meditation practice; your humility and devotion fade.When you befriend those of the lesser way, you yearn for peace and happiness foryourself alone,And you abandon significant acts for others’ benefit.When you befriend those without correct views, meditation, or meditative states,those whose training has lapsed,Those who persist in ordinary deluded thinking, those who are acquisitive,Loners, or those who are nihilist or literalist,You only manage to talk about Buddhism without any meaningful results.Befriending the unintelligent clouds sublime insight gained from hearing andreflection.Befriending the hateful subverts your character.Befriending the lustful fuels craving for the objects of desire.Befriending the proud increases partiality and dualistic attachment.Befriending those who are exceedingly jealous fosters the torment ofcompetitiveness.Befriending those attached to this life, those without disengagement ordisillusionment at the state of existence,Those who socialize, those who seek amusement and follow fashions,Those who wield power or crave wealth, profiteers,Butchers, those who act evilly, those who act deceptively, or those who commitboth good and evil actsContaminates you with the reprehensible behavior of each.Befriending misleading companions undermines lasting happinessAnd leads to extreme suffering in the round of rebirth’s miserable existences:Examine your companions as you would a refuge, a guide, or an article you buy.Forsaking misleading companions increases ennobling acts,You do not regress, and you will fully accomplish mindfulness,Meditative states, vast sublime insight, and an array of qualities.This life and the next will be happy; you will proceed from happiness tohappiness.This concludes “Discipleship,” Book 1 of The Invaluable Treasury of BuddhistDiscourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhist ways of spiritualdevelopment.BOOK 2: THE TRANSMISSION OF BUDDHISMSpiritual masters present the sacred doctrine as follows:Buddhas employ three miracles—Magical emanation, insightful exposition, and instruction.Arhats employed purity in three domains—The pure teacher, auditor, and subjects.Among scholars, those of Nalanda Monastic CollegeTaught the canon according to five magnificent aspects of a teachingAnd the treatises according to five initial considerations.Scholars of Vikramashila Monastic CollegePrepared the worthy recipient, and described the author of the text,The spiritual teaching, how to teach, and how to listen.The five elements of teaching methodsAre the purpose, the summary, the literal meanings, the connections, andrefutations of challenges.The purpose has four aspects: the subject,The purpose, the innermost purpose, and the progression.Explanation of the tantras includes six topics—the general meaning, concealedmeaning,Final meaning, auxiliary meaning, meaning of the words, and pith instructions;The six parameters—definitive meaning, provisional meaning, implied meaning,unimplied meaning,Literal meaning, and not literal meaning;And four methods of interpretation—by the words’ meaning, general meaning,concealed meaning, or final meaning.Many systems of explanation are specific to individual tantras.The four streams comprise the expository scriptures, blessing-empowerments,Aural lineage instructions, and rituals for accomplishing enlightened activity.Other styles of commentary include providing the structure of the meaning,An outline of the main text, a word-by-word commentary,And a summary into pith instructions; or a presentation, explanation, andsummary.Great perfection tantras are taught by describing six subjects:Their essence, definitions, divisions, scope, examples, and proof.The seventeen tantras are Unimpeded Sound, Self-Manifest Awareness,Self-Liberated Awareness, Self-Arisen Perfection,The Lion’s Full Strength, Auspicious Beauty, Exquisite Design of Gems, The PearlGarland, Wordless,Mirror of Vajrasattva’s Heart, Mirror of Ever Excellent’s Wisdom Mind, Union ofSun and Moon,Elaborate Introduction, Blaze of the Holy Form,Heap of Jewels, Blazing Lamps, and Six Expanses.These tantras are classified as three essences, three nectars, and threeflowers.Tantras encompass, plumb the depth, or turn back the assault on wisdom.There are two auxiliary tantras, a tantra of the contemplative practice ofliberation,A heart-like tantra, the secret text we follow, and a weapon-like tantra.They are useful. They can be taught as tantras, transmissions, or pithinstructions;Or according to the collection of twenty-three precious examplesAnd the wish-fulfilling tree of the five principles.The magnificent setting, teacher, doctrine, entourage, and time periodcharacterizeThe turning of the three cycles—on the four truths, on the absence ofcharacteristics, and on definitive meaning.Each of the four collections—on the monastic code,The discourses, on observed phenomena, and the supreme collection on observedphenomena—Contains twenty-one thousand teachings spoken by the Buddha, the extent of thecanon.The doctrine’s eighty-four thousand aggregations were compiled on threeoccasions.The seven patriarchs, the six ornaments, the two supreme teachers, and otherscomposed the treatises.There are six styles of commentaryAnd three methods of teaching.Among the texts translated into Tibetan, there are 210 discourses, 907 tantras,536 commentaries on the discourses,And 2,781 commentaries on the tantras—an approximate total of 4,400 texts.Prepare the throne for the teachings, a seat, a canopy, banners, a parasol,Various forms of music, assorted offerings,And the universe in the form of a mandala, all arranged attractively.Take the teaching seat, uplift your mind to awakening,Then teach coherently with pure and pleasant-sounding words.When teaching the three collections, imagine yourself clearly as Lord of theShakyas;When teaching the outer or inner tantras, as a principal buddha ofenlightenment’s five wisdom clans;When teaching great perfection, as Buddha Ever Excellent.In each case, your adamantine tongue produces the sound of the doctrine in themelodic voice of Brahma.Think that this reaches beings who fill the bounds of space,Wakes them from the sleep of ignorance, and causes the clearly manifestqualitiesOf their innate constituent enlightenment, buddha nature, to blossom.Infants and adults eat different diets;Likewise, teach beginners such subjects as death, and actions and consequences.Teach the lesser and great ways’ paths to those who have entered the Buddhistpath.Teach cosmology and the five subjects of Buddhist culture to those who work forothers’ good.Teach a general outline of the tenets of philosophical schools to groups ofscholars.Teach instruction in the tantras to special recipients.Teach the very profound essential meaning to those of supreme spiritual fortune.For all those of dull minds, praise faith and purification of obscurations.In teaching, generosity is practiced by correct explanation of words andmeaning;Ethical conduct, by freedom from the faults of mental afflictions;Patience, by forbearance of grief or fatigue; diligence, by enthusiasticteaching;Meditative stability, by remaining undistracted; and sublime insight, by makingdistinctions.“By the power of the stores of positive qualities of teaching, of hearing thedoctrine, of reflection and meditation upon it,May all beings, with me, in every lifetime,Always attain the supreme good fortuneOf enjoying the ten ennobling acts and the ten forms of spiritual conduct.”Correct teaching’s benefitsAre enhanced memory, meditative states, self-confidence, and stilling of mentalafflictions.You preserve the teachings’ treasury, you receive teaching from the Buddha,Gods and human beings praise you, your fame increases, you achieve your goals,You are not separated from the doctrine in every lifetime,And you very quickly attain enlightenment and rain the teachings upon beings.When listening to the sacred Buddhist doctrine, present a mandala and a mass ofofferings;Make prostrations, and kneel or sit straight with folded hands.When conducive conditions are gathered, listen respectfully without distraction.When listening, avoid a vessel’s three faults,Six impurities, and thirty-six shortcomings—Six acts of obstructive influences, six acts that cause obscurations,Six causes of abandoning the teachings, six faults of distraction,Six faults of misleading yourself, and six forms of spirituality contrary to thegreat way.Maintain pure motivation by means of six precious attitudes, six hardships,Six armors unaffected by circumstances, six goals,Six necessities, and six ways to seek instruction.When listening in eighty-four ways,The mandala and other offerings constitute generosity;Control of body, voice, and mind, ethical conduct; forbearance of difficulty,patience;Enthusiasm, diligence; undistracted attention, meditative stability;Clarification of misunderstandings, sublime insight.At the conclusion of the teaching, reflect on the master’s kindness, and withinan appreciation of the magical nature of phenomena,Dedicate to awakening the cultivation of the ennobling act of having listened.The benefits of having heard the sound of the conch of the doctrineAre liberation from miserable existence, sublime insight, and flawless memory ofwhat you listened to;Increase of ennobling acts; diminished wrongdoing; praise from gods and humans;And swift attainment of enlightenment, after which you turn the wheel of thedoctrine.Styles of faith in ennobling acts are described as follows:Yearning faith prompts choices in relation to acts, causes, and consequences.Devoted faith leads to dedication toward supreme ideals.Respectful faith leads to outstanding conscientiousness.Lucid faith uplifts the mind to positive qualities.Trusting faith ends doubt concerning the teachings.Certainty in faith leads to application in hearing the doctrine, and inreflection and meditation upon it.The nature of faith resembles a field, a ship,An escort, a vehicle, a jewel, a warrior:You should value faith as your greatest wealth.Without faith, you are like a stone on the ocean floor, a ship without acaptain,An armless person, a burnt seed, the blind.You plunge to the depths of existence and wander forever within the round ofrebirth.Yearning faith arises from disillusionment with existence.Devoted faith arises from disillusionment with evil companions.Respectful faith arises from disillusionment with this life.Lucid faith arises from pure, supreme ideals.Trusting faith arises from hearing about karma and consequences.Certainty in faith arises from all forms of hearing and reflection.Causes that increase faith include relying upon holy persons,Noble companions, examination of the discourses and tantras,Reflection on death, and acts and their consequences.These inspire increased effort in hearing and reflection, which cause faith tocontinually increase.To hear the story of a holy person’s life of freedom; to suffer harm fromdisease, demons, or enemies;To witness death; to experience sudden suffering—Once faith has arisen from having heard the teachings, it is valuable to sustainit.Conditions that cloud faith include consideration of spiritual masters’ faults,Befriending common persons, increased craving for sensual pleasures,Laziness and apathy, preoccupation with this life’s affairs,And activity detrimental to your spiritual life: these are signs of demons’blessing.Indications of the arising of faith include disillusionment with the round ofrebirth;Humility toward the three jewels; exertion in hearing the doctrine, reflection,training, and vows;Practice of ennobling acts; renunciation of wrongdoing; and the arising of newnoble qualities.Faith should be free from six inconsistencies.Unchanging faith should have special qualities,Like the king of mountains, the sun, the ocean, a mother, space, a bow-string,A ship, a bridge, a stream, and a silken cord.The benefits of faith include increase of all positive qualities,Relief from all suffering, finding the path to freedom,Benevolent gods’ protection, success in all your projects,And the attainment of enlightenment: faith’s benefits are infinite.This concludes “The Transmission of Buddhism,” Book 2 of The Invaluable Treasuryof Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhist ways ofspiritual development.BOOK 3: OUR PRECIOUS HUMAN LIFEThe supreme contemplation of those who hear the doctrine with faithFocuses on a jewel valuable beyond measure, the free and fully endowed humanlife,Extremely difficult to find anywhere among the six kinds of beings.Obtaining it is like a blind person finding a gem:Joyously seize its pure essence.You are free from these eight unsatisfactory, restless states based in your ownstream of being:In hell, suffering from heat and cold is unbearable.Starving spirits are exhausted by hunger and thirst.Dumb and foolish animals suffer terribly as beasts of burden.Long-lived gods have no concept of spiritual practice.Barbarians of the hinterlands live without ennobling acts and in the steadyincrease of wrongdoing.Those who are mute or mentally handicapped cannot comprehend words or meanings.Those who hold wrong views abjure correct views.During dark eons, people live in ignorance of the subject of which acts toundertake and which to reject.Renounce these eight restless states due to immediate circumstances:Corrupting acts due to the five poisons’ turmoil;To fall under misleading companions’ influence due to foolish and deludedthinking;To fall into demons’ clutches due to mistaken views and conduct on a wrong path;Distraction by indolence although you intended to further your spiritualtraining;Although diligent, to be tormented by events when the lake of your bad karmaoverflows;To belong to the class of servants who live helplessly in others’ power;To strive for materialistic goals because you entered the teachings for thislife’s sake;To practice Buddhism for gain, fame, or honor because your spiritual practice iscontrived.Eight restless states due to unconducive attitudes are the following:To be bound by cords of attachment to family, friends, food, or wealth;To have ignoble behavior and character that makes spiritual practiceunprofitable;To feel no fear toward the sufferings of the round of rebirth or the miserableexistences;To feel no faith whatsoever in ennobling acts;Your acts in thought, word, and deed consist of corrupting wrongdoing;To never consider the positive qualities of ennobling acts or the sacreddoctrine;To have damaged your vows of individual liberation or of awakened mind;To have violated secret mantra’s principal or secondary bonds.Freedom from these twenty-four (three groups of eight) unsatisfactory, restlessstates is crucial.Five personal endowments must be complete:Previous spiritual training in ennobling acts has awakened—you attained a humanbirth.You were born in a central country where the doctrines of Buddhist teaching andpractice have spread.You possess the supreme conditions for spiritual practice—all your senses areintact.You have not transgressed the laws of karma because you feel inclined towardennobling acts.You have faith in the sanctuary of faith, the three jewels.The twelve unsurpassable teachers have appeared in this world.They turned the wheel of the doctrine’s nine ways of discourses and tantras.The general and specific durations of the doctrine have not expired.Many persons have entered the teachings’ gate and accomplished the two goals.Qualified spiritual masters have accepted you and benefactors support you.These five social endowments together with the five personal endowments comprisethe ten conducive endowments.Now that they are complete, accomplish your long-term aspirations.To give an example, to attain a precious human birth is rarerThan for a turtle to stick its head through the holeOf a yoke adrift on the open seas.It is more difficult to be born with a body possessing these qualitiesThan for beans to sprout on the surface of a plastered wall.It is even more difficult than for a mustard seed to grow on the point of aneedle.Concerning number, humans, animals, starving spirits,And hell beings are like daytime stars and stars at night:The former is far outnumbered by the latter.It is said that animals fill the oceans like the fermented grains left afterbeer has been brewed;Starving spirits cluster like snowflakes in a snowstorm;And hell beings are as numerous as the particles of dust on the earth.Mere human beings have no notionOf ennobling acts or wrongdoing and their ripening:Their evil behavior leads them to fall to the miserable existences’ endlessdepths.Special human beings, either householders or practitioners,Confound ennobling acts and wrongdoing—Sometimes they perform spiritual acts, but mostly materialistic ones.At death, they have nothing but the seed of freedom.The precious human life is the supreme support or vessel for the practice of theBuddhist teachings.Such persons diligently apply themselves to hearing the doctrine, and toreflection and meditation upon it, subduing well their own minds,And they energetically bring others to the correct path.The victors have commended and praised this life as sublime.Even the Buddhist teachings depend on the mind.The mind is based upon this free and fully endowed life. Therefore, when all thecauses and conditions are gathered,Make subduing the mind the focus of your Buddhist practice.Now that you have it, ride the ship of the free and fully endowed human lifeAcross the wide sea of existence’s unbearable suffering.If you do not make this exemplary life a vessel for the teachings,The round of rebirth’s many sufferings will torment you later.Like returning empty-handed from an isle of jewels,To waste this free and fully endowed life in meaningless acts is unconscionable.Since time immemorial, sufferings of existence have fallen like rain,The fault of not reflecting on the difficulty of attaining this human life.Upon the attainment of the precious human bodyDepends the support for the doctrine of the lesser and great ways, discoursesand mantra;And the results of the paths of hearers, solitary sages, arhats, the victors’heirs, and sublime victors.Therefore, grasp the essence of this life and always meditate joyously.You must spurn all materialistic, meaningless acts.Renounce both lifestyles’ activities: farming, companions,Fortune, giving counsel, partiality, and philosophies.When you have these conditions, you can achieve their related work:The finest horse; warmth, moisture, and manure; a warrior’s troops;A mine; autumn crops; a guide; equipment; or servants.Likewise, energetically make your human life’s leisure and endowments meaningfulnow.In any activity, such as moving about or sitting, abandon six faults, includingindolence.Like the hungry seeing foodOr the thirsty seeing drink; the destitute, wealth and possessions;Doctors, medicine; parents, their children;Those in danger seeking any refuge they can find,Practice every form—elaborate or simple—of the cultivation of ennobling acts.Energetic reflection as described leads you to forsake this life’s concerns,To strive for the next life, and to spend this life busy in the practice ofennobling acts.The blaze ignited by diligence will quickly liberate you from the ocean ofexistence:You will hold the victory banner of freedom.This concludes “Our Precious Human Life,” Book 3 of The Invaluable Treasury ofBuddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhist ways ofspiritual development.BOOK 4: REFLECTION ON DEATH AND IMPERMANENCEAlthough you have gained a life with leisure, so difficult to attain,It is definitely impermanent, like a jewel found in a dream.This body and possessions, seemingly so real,Are all impermanent in their minutest detail; even your body will change intoanother.The four elements, Supreme Mountain, and the four continents, with the sun andmoon,And any being of the six kinds in billions of realms are impermanent.All undergo the four stages of formation, duration, destruction, and vacuity:How can this bubble-like body be permanent?If very powerful beings, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, planets, nagas, noxiousspirits,Universal monarchs, and others imbued with glowing strength, wealth, and gloryAre subject to impermanence,This body of negligible goodness will soon pass away.Guides of this world, mighty sage buddhas; hosts of victors’ spiritual heirs;Hearers, solitary sages, the circle of disciples, and the doctrineHave previously appeared in infinite numbers but were each subject toimpermanence:This life which is like dew cannot last.After birth, death is certainBut its time, place, and causes are not.Many things cause death; few prolong life.Time cannot be added; life passes in an instant. It is impossible to stay.At death, your home, possessions, family, glory, abilities,Masses of supporters, and other things are all of no use.Therefore, it makes sense to abandon now the projects of this life’s deludedperceptionsAnd to strive single-mindedly at the sacred Buddhist doctrine.The people gathered in one household and close entourageAre like shoppers in the marketplace—each goes his or her own way.Old or young, it is uncertain who will have to depart for the next life:Everyone should avoid animosity or quarrels and devote themselves to ennoblingacts.A tree on the riverbank, a decrepit house, an old tree trunk,Dry wood, autumn flowers, thunder or echoes,Clouds, fog, a rainbow, the sun and moon,And the extinguishing of a flame: these illustrate the body’s impermanence.At death, the three jewels and your stores of ennobling acts will surely provehelpful.Rely upon holy persons; and in everything you do, whether sitting or moving,Remember death as a means to inspire yourself to spiritual life.You should guard this as the heart of your experiential cultivation.Reflecting on death, you see the destructibility of composite phenomena.Your diligence increases and you abandon pursuit of this life’s activity.You have not even an instant of leisure time to dwell in the mundane.Disillusionment and renunciation diminish your preoccupations.The benefits are abandonment of faulty behavior; the natural gathering ofqualities;Liberation from delusion, from desire and anger, and from attachment to thingsas permanent;Utmost diligence in ennobling acts; completion of stores of goodness and wisdom;and consideration by the victors:You die in happiness and quickly attain enlightenment.This concludes “Reflection on Death and Impermanence,” Book 4 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhistways of spiritual development.BOOK 5: THE WORKINGS OF KARMADeath is certain; therefore, the choice between ennobling acts and wrongdoing isour central issue.On the foundation of the storehouse of all dualistic experience, ignorance andits associated factors—The afflicted mind’s three poisons—produce the ten corrupting acts,Which result in the three miserable existences; and the ten ennobling acts,which result in birth as a god or human;And uncontaminated ennobling acts, which lead to the attainment of freedom.Killing is the unmistaken, deliberate ending of another’s life;Striking, beating, or other acts that harm another’s well-being belong to thesame category.Taking what is not given is to steal another’s wealth;Gain through deceitful or dishonest means belongs to the same category.Wrong sexual conduct is to have intercourse with a partner claimed by another;Inappropriate sexual activity belongs to the same category.Lying is to confound truth and lies in order to deceive another;Manipulation with seeming honesty belongs to the same category.Divisive speech is to speak words that estrange persons in harmony or thosealready unfriendly;To incite animosity by speaking of another’s faults belongs to the samecategory.Meaningless speech is to talk of unsound treatises or gossip;To speak of irrelevant or materialistic topics belongs to the same category.Rough speech is to use words that hurt another’s feelings;To talk of things that cause others discomfort belongs to the same category.Covetousness is the wish to acquire another’s possessions;To be attached through desire to another’s wealth belongs to the same category.Ill will is mental agitation with malicious thoughts toward another;To not wish for another’s good fortune belongs to the same category.Wrong views are views of eternalism, nihilism, or of no relation between actionand consequence;To exaggerate or denigrate the correct teachings belongs to the same category.Corrupting acts produce four consequences:Ripened consequences, experience consistent with karma, acts consistent withkarma, and environmental consequences.Acts’ ripened fruits are these:Minor acts among the ten corrupting acts result in rebirth as an animal;Medium acts, as a starving spirit; and serious acts, as a hell being.Experience consistent with corrupting karma is as follows: even if you attainrebirth in the higher existences,Killing results in a short life span and in many sicknesses that proveincurable.Taking what was not given results in poverty and in encountering many enemiesand thieves.Wrong sexual conduct results in an unattractive spouse and in many competitiveenemies.Lying results in slander and deceit.Divisive speech results in separation from friends and in general disharmony.Rough speech results in hearing many unpleasant things and in arguments.Meaningless speech results in lack of self-confidence and in not being believed.Covetousness results in not accomplishing your hopes and in lack of contentment.Ill will results in fearfulness and in often being harmed.Wrong views result in continued bad views and in often being deceived.Thus, each consequence of the ten corrupting acts has two aspects.Acts consistent with the ten corrupting forms of karmaIncline a person to continue to do nowWhatever acts he or she did in the past and thus, naturally and effortlessly,To commit many evil deeds and to fall once again to miserable existences.Environmental consequences ripen in the place of birth:Taking another’s life results in birth in an unattractive regionWhere medicinal plants do not grow, the food and drink are not nutritious andhard to digest,And any sickness can be life-threatening.Taking what was not given results in birth where harvests do not ripen,Frost and hail are common, and famines occur.Wrong sexual conduct results in birth in a swampy area,In a region which is unhygienic and malodorous with feces and urine,And in a frightening and depressing place.Lying results in birth in a land of disharmony and changing fortunes,And in a deceptive region full of fear.Divisive speech results in birth in a land of ravines, steep cliffs, and deepgorges,Where travel is difficult, the land is very uneven,And both moving and settling down are inconvenient.Rough speech results in birth in a dusty, filthy land of bad crops,Where rocks, stunted tree trunks, thorns, salty ground, and other thingsMake the land disturbing and unpleasant.Meaningless speech results in birth in an unstable land where the seasons areunpredictable,And where harvests do not ripen.Covetousness results in birth in a land where fruit is sparse but barkplentiful,And where the place and time are evil.Ill will results in birth in a land where harm abounds:Bandits, thieves, snakes, poison, rulers’ punishments,Wild malicious animals, and hot-tasting fruit.Wrong views result in birth in a land without natural resources, such as jewels,Where flowers, fruit, and medicinal trees are rare,And where there is no security or powerful friends to provide sanctuary.The path of ennobling acts has ten aspects:Having renounced killing, you ransom the lives of those sure to die.Not taking what was not given, you give gifts of material goods.Not engaging in wrongful sexual activity, you act purely.Not lying, you speak honestly.Not speaking divisively, you seek to reconcile discord between others.Not speaking nonsense, you talk about meaningful subjects.Not speaking roughly, you speak pleasantly.Not coveting, you are content.Untroubled by ill will, you develop an altruistic attitude.Having abandoned wrong views, you devote yourself to correct views.Acts of stillness are meditations of the four levels of meditative stabilityAnd the four formless realms.The consequences of ripened ennobling acts are these:Ennobling acts tainted by jealousy and associated factors result in birth inregions of demigods; Minor accumulation of ten ennobling acts tainted by prideresults in birth as a human being;Middle accumulation of such acts, among gods of the desire realm;Major accumulation of such acts, if done in conjunction with the four levels ofmeditative stability, among gods in the form realm.If the ten ennobling acts are performed in conjunction with the four levels offormless meditative stability, among gods in the formless realm.In the desire realm, karma principally manifests in the seven collections ofcoarse consciousness;In the form realm, in clarity without discursive thought, the storehouseconsciousness;In the formless realm, in tranquility that remains one-pointed within thestorehouse of all dualistic experience.Experience consistent with ennobling karma is as follows:Renunciation of killing results in long life, freedom from illness, andhappiness.Renunciation of taking what was not given results in attainment of magnificentpower and wealth.Renunciation of wrong sexual conduct results in an attractive partner and nocompetitive enemies.Renunciation of telling lies results in gaining others’ praise and respect.Renunciation of divisive speech results in being attractive in others’ sight.Renunciation of meaningless speech results in your words being credited astrustworthy.Renunciation of rough speech results in the increase of your favorable renown.Renunciation of covetousness results in accomplishment of all your goals.Renunciation of ill will results in being attractive and subduing others onsight.Renunciation of wrong views results in correct views arising in your mind.The consequence of having practiced the ten ennobling acts in previous lifetimesIs turning away from corrupting acts in thought, word, and deed,And natural application to the ten ennobling acts.This leads to the attainment of excellent lifetimes among gods and humans.The environmental consequences of engaging in the ten ennobling acts are asfollows:Renunciation of killing results in birth in a pleasant land,Where medicine and grains are nutritious and life is secure.Renunciation of taking what was not given results in birth in a land whereharvests are abundantAnd wealth in food and riches increases.Renunciation of wrong sexual conduct results in birth in an attractive land,Which is clean, wide, and sweet-smelling.Renunciation of lying results in birth in a landWhere wealth lasts, which lives in harmony with its neighbors, and where thereis no deceit or fear.Renunciation of divisive speech results in birth in a landWhich is spacious, happy, and even; where both travel and settling down areeasy.Renunciation of meaningless speech results in birth in a landWhere the seasons are regular, where leaves, flowers, and fruit ripen on time.Renunciation of rough speech results in birth in a landWhere the land and fields are even, and which is adorned with lakes and pools.Renunciation of covetousness results in birth in a landWhere plentiful harvests of every desirable object multiply.Renunciation of ill will results in birth in a landWhere all inhabitants—humans and nonhumans—are not harmful, and which has everyconducive condition.Renunciation of wrong views results in birth in a magnificent land,Which has jewel mines, security, and powerful allies.To gain freedom from the sufferings of existence,Enter the way of the hearers, solitary sages, or bodhisattvas,Then strive day and night at ennobling acts,Epitomized by awakening’s thirty-seven facets,The four immeasurable aspirations, and the six transcendent perfections.Ennobling acts of body, speech, and mind such as theseSealed with dedication to enlightenment are called “acts consistent withfreedom.”Physical, verbal, and mental ennobling acts guided by the skillful means andsublime insightOf the three Buddhist ways constitute actsThat result in the temporary attainment of life as a god or human and in theultimate attainmentOf the hearers’ or solitary sages’ awakening or of supreme awakening.This concludes “The Workings of Karma,” Book 5 of The Invaluable Treasury ofBuddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhist ways ofspiritual development.BOOK 6: THE FLAWS OF THE ROUND OF REBIRTHAs described, action and consequences function precisely and subtly.Therefore, many evil acts motivated by the power of angerResult in the hells’ excruciating suffering.Among these, in Reviving Hell, beings take miraculous birth on a ground of hotiron,On seeing one another, they become uncontrollably enraged, and strike oneanother with sharp weapons.Once dead, a sound revives them, and they reexperience the same torment.Their duration of life is calculated as follows:Fifty human years equal a day for the gods of the four great divine kings.Thirty such days equal a month; twelve months, one year.Five hundred of such years equal one day in Reviving Hell.Beings in this hell live five hundred of their own years:Thus, they suffer for a totalOf one trillion, six hundred and twenty billion human years.Below, in Black Line Hell, beings are sliced up by saws, then rejoined, andagain cut and rejoined:Their sufferings are immeasurable.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: one hundred human years equalone day for the gods in Heaven of the Thirty-Three;One thousand of their years equal one day in Black Line Hell;Beings in that hell live one thousand of their own years.In human terms, this equals three trillion, two hundred and forty billion yearsOf enduring suffering from being cut and sliced up.Below, in Crushing Hell, the mountains are shapedLike heads of tigers, lions, horses, or camels.Beings are pulverized to dust between these; the mountains separate, and thebeings return to life.In a region of iron, hammers beat them to powder;They are pressed so their blood flows in great streams.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: two hundred human years equalone day in the Heaven of Twins;Two thousand years there equal one day in Crushing Hell;Beings in this hell live two thousand years,Equal in human terms to six trillion, four hundred and eighty billion yearsOf torment due to unbearable karma.Below, in Wailing Hell, beings are burned in blazing fires and cooked in molteniron:They cry out in agony.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: four hundred human years equalone day in Joyful Heaven.Four thousand years there equal one day in Wailing Hell;Beings in this hell live four thousand of their own years,Equal in human termsTo twelve trillion, nine hundred and sixty billion years.Below, in Great Screaming Hell, in iron buildings,Beings are burnt in blazing fires: a great screaming resounds.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: eight hundred human years equalone day in Heaven of Joy in Creation.Eight thousand years there equal one day in Great Screaming Hell.Beings in this hell live eight thousand of their own years,Equal in human terms to twenty-five trillion, nine hundred and twenty billionyears.Below, in Hot Hell, beings enter blazing iron buildings,Where they are beaten by hammers and pierced by spears.Their duration of life is calculated as follows:One thousand, six hundred human years equal one day in Heaven of Control ofOthers’ Creations.Sixteen thousand years there equal one day in Hot Hell.Hell beings there live sixteen thousand of their own years,Equal in human termsTo fifty-one trillion, eight hundred and forty billion years of the experienceof suffering.Below, in Extremely Hot Hell, in two-storied iron buildings,Beings are pierced by a three-pronged spear that protrudes from the head and thetwo shoulders,Then placed on a flat slab of blazing iron and cooked in molten copper.Life there lasts half an eon,A time incalculable in human years.Below, in the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, in blazing iron buildings,No difference can be perceived between sentient beings and fire,Apart from hell beings’ anguished cries.They are consumed like a lamp’s wick.Life there lasts for an intermediate eon.Since no greater suffering exists,This hell is known as Torment Without Respite or Interruption.The differences in the heat of the hells’ fires are this:Each is seven times more intense than the one above.The eight cold hells are located in layers directly above the eight hot hells.In their dark expanse, raging snowstorms swirlIn icy enclosures that are extremely cold.In descending order, they are Blistering, Blister Bursting,Teeth Chattering, Sneezing Achoo, Sneezing Kerchoo,Splitting like a Water Lily, Splitting like a Lotus,And Splitting like a Large Lotus.Inside the hell beings’ open wounds live various sharp-toothed insects that gnawinto their flesh.Their duration of life is calculated as follows:If one hundred bags of sesame seeds are emptied at the rate of one grain eachhundred years, this equals the life of a being in Blistering.Longevity in each hell is double that of the preceding one.The neighboring hells are located around the eight hot hells or around the Hellof Uninterrupted Torment.Four lie in each of the four directions, sixteen in all:Fire Pit, Swamp of Corpses, Plain of Weapons,And River Without Ford.In Fire Pit, beings find a good trench where they can hide, but when they enterit, it becomes a pit of coalsWhere they experience the suffering of their flesh and bones being burned.In Swamp of Corpses, they see a cool swamp but when they enter it, it becomes aswamp of corpses,Where stinking worms with sharp iron and copper beaks eat them.In Plain of Weapons, they see a pleasant plain but when they go there,Many extremely sharp razors slice them to pieces.When they go to an attractive forest, it becomes a forest of swords—The wind moves the swords, which fall, cutting them.They see their previous homeland at the top of a mountain, but as they go towardit,Sharp iron spikes cut them so they bleed.At the top, vultures pluck out their brains, eyes, and fat.Then they think they hear a summons from the bottom of the hill—During their descent, the spikes turn upward and they are again tormented bybeing pierced.At the bottom, they are embraced by sharp-toothed men or women,Burned, and then eaten by dogs and wolves.In River Without Ford, they see a river, but on entering it, they sink up totheir necksIn hot ash, burning their flesh and bones.On the banks they see fearsome death demons who prevent them from leaving.In these hells, suffering is experienced for many thousands of years.Occasional hells are located in various places—On mountains, in forests, between rocks, in fire or water, or at the edge of thecontinents.Beings can be few, many, or alone, and so on;Each is oppressed by suffering appropriate to their karma.A moderate number of evil acts motivated by desire and greed results in birth asa starving spirit.Starving spirits obscured in relation to outer phenomena see any of fourmistaken perceptions:Those who mistakenly perceive mountains see a cool forest, but on going there,The forest burns and falling pieces of wood scorch them.Those who mistakenly perceive rivers see a stream, but on going there,The wind blows hot sand: the place becomes a plain of agony.Those who mistakenly perceive rain clouds see a cloud from which a rain of ironarrowsFalls like bolts of lightning with fire-arrows and smoke, cutting them.Those who mistakenly perceive temperature feel snowstorms hot when heatthreatens them,And fire cold when cold threatens.Those obscured in relation to physical perceptions have a mouth the size of theeye of a needle,A belly the size of a province, and arms and legs the size of blades of grass.When they eat a little, a fire burns inside,Scorches their inner organs, and sends smoke billowing out their mouths.Those who have general obscurations are obsessed with food and drinkBut see others aggressively guarding the food.Starving spirits who fly through space include ruler demons,Noxious spirits, ogres, tsen spirits, and demons.They fly unhindered through the power of their miraculous karma.They cause diseases, steal radiant well-being, obstruct vitality,And perform various kinds of harmful acts.Their duration of life is calculated as follows: one human month is a day forthe starving spirits.They live five hundred of their own years: in human terms, fifteen thousandyears,During which they experience suffering corresponding to their previous acts.A small number of corrupting acts motivated by stupidity results in birth as ananimal.Submerged in the depths of oceans between the continents,Dolphins, fish, crustaceans, and other such wealth of the nagas—Animals of various shapes and sizes—Live crowded together like the fermented grains left after beer has been brewed.The large eat the small; the small pierce the large.At such dark places as the sides of the iron mountains at the far reaches of theworld-system,Animals experience the limitless suffering of being eaten by one another.Species scattered among the five other realms of existence—Such as birds, deer, wild animals, horses, cattle, and sheep—Are made beasts of burden or are slaughtered for their meat, skin, or bones.Hot sand and fear of garudas torment nagas.The animals who live the longest live for an eon; the shortest, for a day.Life span is uncertain and varied.A small number of ennobling acts motivated by pride and attachmentResults in birth as a human of the four continents.Humans of all four continents, and particularly those of this world, Land ofJambu,Experience torment by three principal and eight secondary sufferings.The three principal sufferings are suffering heaped upon suffering:For example, when assailed by enemies, to fall ill.The suffering of change: for example, after suffering from hunger, to be unableto digest food.The suffering of the composite: for example, to act corruptly to acquire food orclothing;Or afflictive poisons that lead to committing the causes of suffering.In the womb, energy, mind, semen, and ovum conjoin:The fetus grows and develops for nine months and ten days,During which time it experiences the sufferings of being cramped in a dark,nauseating place.When the mother eats, the fetus feels as if crushed under a mountain;When she moves, as if falling down a precipice.When karma turns the child’s head and backsides around at birth,The child experiences suffering like that of the Crushing Hell.During the suffering of aging, the complexion fades, hair turns white,Teeth fall out, eyes weaken, warmth grows faint, digestive strength isexhausted,Memory fades, and you walk, sit, or move with difficulty.The tongue cannot taste distinct flavors, sounds are unheard,Faults multiply, qualities diminish: everybody disdains you.During the suffering of sickness, this healthy bodyIs made seriously ill by disturbances of circulating energy, bile, or phlegm.Food and drink seem revolting,Sleep is impossible, lancing pain racks your body,And intolerably strong medicines and treatments, such as burning andblood-letting, must be borne.When life’s creative force is spent, karma at an end, and conditions thatnurture life dissipate,The signs of death appear and delusory perceptions arise.You must leave behind this cherished body, possessions, family, and companionsTo wander alone along the terrifying passage between lifetimes.You assume the new miserable body your karma impels you to take—Miseries such as these make the suffering of death interminable. Howheartbreaking!The suffering of meeting enemiesIncludes the misery of not having the means to prevent their harmTo your body or possessionsDue to their numbers; their foul, harmful acts; or their time of appearing.When separated from loved ones,You remember their qualities and wail with many laments.Without companions or loved ones, your power is weak, your mind hesitant.You have no opportunity for happiness; you feel great anguish.With no food for your mouth, no clothes for your back,No place to stay, no useful wealth,You sink into the misery of poverty and destitution,When no matter how hard you try, you can’t accomplish the slightest fraction ofyour wishes.The five contaminated psychophysical aggregations—Form, sensation, perception, formative factors, and consciousness—Are nothing but suffering’s support, vessel, and source.Ennobling acts influenced by jealousy and associated factorsResult in birth as a demigod of four kinds.They feel overpowering jealousy toward the gods’ wealth and splendorAnd are wounded or killed in battle during conflicts and disputes with the gods.Accumulating a large number of the ten ennobling acts motivated by pride resultsin birth as a god of the desire realm.When they suffer death and falling,Their color worsens, their seat becomes uncomfortable, their flowers wilt,Their clothes reek, and their bodies perspire.Abandoned by friends, they sit alone and confused.With clairvoyant power, they see the place of their future rebirth: they becometerrified.These unbearable experiences last for seven days of the gods.When the form realm gods’ karma of meditative stability is spentOr when the formless gods’ karma of stillness is exhausted,They plummet from level to level, experiencing endless descent into thesuffering of conditioned existence.Therefore, attainment of higher existences is but a fleeting respite fromsuffering.Since suffering exists wherever you are born within the round of rebirth,You must exert yourself to achieve freedom.The techniques taught by innumerable victors have not been sufficient inthemselves:Think, “I will strive above all else at the sublime means to reach freedomAnd accomplish my aspirations for a lasting state of sure excellence.”This concludes “The Flaws of the Round of Rebirth,” Book 6 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhistways of spiritual development.BOOK 7: TAKING REFUGE AND THE LESSER WAYRefuge is taken in fear of the round of rebirth as described,And with the wish for freedom.Lesser individuals take refuge in fear of miserable existencesAnd to gain the higher existences of gods and humans.The two kinds of middle individual fear the round of rebirth.Great individuals take refuge to liberate all beings and in fear of bothexistence and the bliss of static peace.These three individuals’ attitudes are inferior, middle, and best.The duration of refuge: Lesser individuals take refuge until they achievepositive results later.Middle individuals take refuge either temporarily, for as long as they live,Or ultimately, until they achieve the results of the ways of hearers or solitarysages.Great individuals take refuge until they reach unsurpassable awakening.The formless body of ultimate enlightenment is endowed with five kinds ofvision, six forms of clairvoyance,Ten powers, aspects of retention, ten forces,Four forms of fearlessness, four modes of individual awareness,And eighteen unique qualities.Enlightenment’s two bodies that have form—the body of perfect rapture and thesublime manifest body—Display the thirty-two excellent signs, the eighty marks of physical perfection,And all sixty aspects of melodious speech.They epitomize wisdom, love, and capability.The doctrine of scripture comprises discourses, aphorisms in verse,Prophetic declarations, verses, meaningful expressions, narratives,Parables, legends, extensive teachings,Tales of past lives, established instructions, and marvelous events;And the tantras—action, conduct, yoga, father, mother, and nondual.The doctrine of realization comprises realizationGained from experiential cultivation on the paths of the ways of discourses andtantras.The spiritual community comprises hearers and solitary sages in four pairs,The victors’ heirs who have reached stages of awakening, and hosts of dakinis,adepts, and awareness holders.In the vivid presence of the places of refuge, imagined in space,All beings respectfully fold hands in prayer with you and recite:“To become free from every dangerOf the realms of existence and of static peace,I respectfully take refuge with faith in the spiritual master,The Buddha, the doctrine, and the spiritual community, until I attainunsurpassable awakening.”After repeating those lines three times, consider that you receive the refugevows.The givers of refuge joyfully send their blessings in the form of a mass oflightThat purifies your own and every being’s physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoingand obscurations:This completes your cultivation of goodness and plants the fortune for you toattain enlightenment’s bodies that have form.The Buddha is the teacher of your teacher of refuge;The doctrine is the path; the spiritual community, your companions in itspractice.The place of refuge which is the result is the body of ultimate enlightenment’swisdom—The ultimate jewel, luminosity, the sublime state free from embellishment.Settle in evenness in the ultimate ongoing stateIn which the giver of refuge and the taker of refuge are indivisible.This completes the store of wisdom and leads to the attainment of the body ofultimate enlightenment.After, in the understanding of phenomena as illusory, dedicate the goodness ofthe act of having taken refuge.Training in refuge as a cause includes the following points: do not forsake thespiritual master and the three jewelsEven for the sake of your life or country.After having taken refuge in the spiritual master, do not mislead venerablepersons;Forsake slander or unpleasant speech to holy persons.After having taken refuge in the Buddha, do not bow or make offerings to othergods; respect Buddhist images.After having taken refuge in the doctrine,Renounce harming others; respect the slightest amount of the written word.After having taken refuge in the spiritual community, do not make closefriendships with non-Buddhists, and foster respect toward even a scrap of orangecloth.During the day and night’s six sessions, remember the three jewels and takerefuge.Training in refuge as a result includes training in the native state of thenature of reality,Unembellished by concepts of high and low, what must be done or not done, and soon.The refuge vows are given up when wrong views have arisen and the training isviolated.The benefits of refuge are freedom from fear during future lifetimes;Rapid completion of the stores of goodness and wisdom; increase of qualities;And protection by benevolent gods: refuge has limitless benefits.It forms the supreme foundation for all qualities.In the sublime doctrinal cycle of the four truths,The Teacher, the Buddha, emphasized training in ethical conduct.In Varanasi, he taught this to the five excellent individuals. Upali compiledthese teachings.Five hundred arhats composed The Treasury of Detailed Explanation.Gunaprabha wrote and spread The Root Discourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct;Shakyaprabha, The Three-Hundred-Verse Commentary on the Training of Novices, andother texts.In Tibet, Shantarakshita spread the lineage of the substantialist order’s vows.The original translations include four texts on the transmission of discipline:The Basic Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct, The Detailed Scripture onthe Monastic Code of Conduct, The Supplementary Scripture on the Monastic Codeof Conduct, and The Highest Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct.These books contain a total of 104,800 stanzas.The Tibetan canon contains seventy-two discoursesAnd sixty-three treatises of commentary that belong to this cycle.The essence of the vows is abjuration, based on an attitude of disengagement,Of acts that harm others and the basis of such acts.Since the vows arise based upon the body and voice,They are considered to have form.The seed of a continual attitude of renunciation is crucial.The vows’ classification includes three vows for laypersons:Vows for temporary fasting, and vows for male and female laypersons;And five kinds of vows for renunciants: vows for male novice monk and femalenovice nun, female spiritual apprentice, and fully ordained monk and fullyordained nun.Together, these constitute the eight kinds of individual liberation vows.Another classification counts four: vows of temporary fasting, layperson,novice, and full ordination.Rituals of former times to receive vows included natural full ordination;Full ordination was also completed by understanding wisdom; acceptance of thecommand, “Come forward!”;Promises; replies to questions; and messages.In modern rituals, an individual free of the five certain hindrances and withnone of the four obstaclesReceives the ordination gradually, in three stages.In the former two stages, before full ordination, refuge,Personal affirmation, and others’ acceptance constitute the three parts.The vows arise after the personal affirmation. In the latter stage, whichcomprises recitations of the essence, action, and performance,The vows arise immediately after the action recitation.The temporary fasting vows have eight aspects:The four main vows—aspects concerned with ethical conduct;Renunciation of intoxicants—an aspect concerned with conscientiousness;Renunciation of seats that are large or high, dancing and wearing garlands,And eating after the noon meal—three aspects of disciplined conduct.Lay practitioners who maintain the three refugesRenounce three things and practice three things.Among five acts, four principal acts can be renounced—to kill, to steal,wrongful sexual conduct, and to lie;And a supplementary act—to take intoxicants.One, two, three, or five of these can be renounced.To do so represents, respectively, “one part,” “some parts,” “most,” and“complete” conduct.To renounce all impure (that is, sexual) activity constitutes the “pure-livinglayperson’s” vows.To sustain these eight vows permanently constitutes the “venerable layperson’s”vows.Novices renounce four principal acts—Taking life, taking what was not given, impure conduct, and lying;And six supplementary acts—taking intoxicants, dancing and related acts, wearinggarlands and related attire, resting on a high bed,Eating after the noon meal, and accepting gold and silver.When added to the first four, these comprise ten coarse acts.There are thirty fine points of training, thirteen permissions,And three pertinent offenses to be renounced.Female spiritual apprentices must renounce six principal acts—To travel alone, to swim, to touch an adult male person,To sit together with an adult male, to match-make, and to conceal their faults;And six related ones—to keep gold, to shave their pubic hair,To till the soil, to eat food that has not been formally offered and accepted,To eat stored food, and to cut grass.The discipline for fully ordained monks comprises two hundred and fifty-threeregulations.They are divided into five classes of downfalls.The first class is the four principal defeating acts;The first of these is impure conduct.Its basis one of the three openings of another’s body;The intention is to satisfy desire; the act is the movement of the penis; thecompletion is satisfaction.The second defeating act is to take what has not been given.The basis of theft is another’s wealth; the intention is the wish to make it themonk’s own;The act is to steal a valuable object.The completion of the act is to have thought that he has obtained it. At thatmoment, the vow is broken.The third defeating act is taking human life.The basis of killing is another human being.The intention is the wish to kill the individual the monk knows is present.The act is to begin the act of murder. Its completion is achieved when the otherdies before the monk.The fourth defeating act is to lie concerning spiritual attainment.The basis of lying is a human being who understands the meaning of the monk’swords;The intention is to wish to speak in order to change the other’s perception;The act is to claim clairvoyance or other abilities, although the monk has none;The act is completed when the other understands the lie.The thirteen remaining downfalls are to ejaculate, to touch a female out ofdesire,To speak lustful words to a woman, to extol service for intercourse, tomatch-make,To construct an oversized house, to construct a large house for himself,Baseless accusation, slightly substantiated accusation,To create a division within the monastic community, to side with those who splitthe monastic community,To disappoint laypersons, and to voice discontentment with the commands of themonastic assembly.The thirty downfalls for which the object that caused the downfall must beforfeited concern the robes, the mat, and the begging bowl—ten for each.The ninety downfalls are divided into nine categories of ten each:Conscious, seeds, without designation, repetition,Within water, layperson, intentional, many travelers, and teaching the doctrine.The four acts to be acknowledged individually are to beg for food, to eat foodserved with favoritism,To beg in spite of restrictions, and to not watch the forest but to eat.The one hundred and twelve reprehensible acts include ten concerning wearingclothes—Seven concern the lower robe; three, the upper robe.Twenty concern behavior when walking to homes; nine, how to sit;Eight, acceptance of food; twenty-one, eating food;Fourteen, handling the begging bowl;Twenty-six, teaching; three, practice of hygiene; and one, movement.In total, there are two hundred and fifty-three vows for fully ordained monks.In brief, a fully ordained nun renounces eight defeating acts, twenty remainingdownfalls,Thirty-three downfalls that require relinquishment, one hundred and eightysimple downfalls,Eleven acts to be acknowledged individually, and one hundred and twelvereprehensible acts—Three hundred and sixty-four regulations in all.The life that is the support for the vows is a male or female human beingFrom one of three continents. Non-Buddhists, those who have committed one of theacts of immediate fruition,Persons without genitals, or persons from the continent of Unpleasant Sound areineligible.The vows are terminated by offering back the training, by death, by change ofgender,By the arising of wrong views, by the commission of one of the principaldownfalls,By the decline of the sacred Buddhist doctrine, or by other events.If a defeating act has been committed, the fact must not be concealed. Thetraining must be offered back with regret:It is said the vows can thereby arise again.If a defeating act is concealed, the vows cannot be repaired during thislifetime.In the case of remaining downfalls, downfalls that require relinquishment, andothers, they must be regrettedIn the presence of the monastic community. By energetic application to restoringthe vows, they can be purified.On the basis of the vows of individual liberation, taken so that the holderreaches freedom from existence,The hearers practice the four guidelines of ennobling training.The view is realization of the nonexistence of a self sensed in the individual;Meditation is actualization of the thirty-seven facets of awakeningAlong the paths of cultivation, application, seeing, and meditation.The code of conduct is to keep the two hundred and fifty-three monastic vowsduring ten thousand great eons.Having thus trained, the result beyond training is the state of arhat.The foundation of the way of solitary sages is to correctly restrain yourself,motivated by disengagement.The view is the nonexistence of the individual sense of self, but withoutrenunciationOf the clinging consciousness that grasps objective phenomena.The rhinoceros-like sage traverses the path during the course of one hundredgreat eons;The solitary sage of a large community, during one hundred lifetimes;And the solitary sage of a small community, in just thirteen human lifetimes.On the four paths—cultivation, application, seeing, and meditation—Meditation is done on the thirty-seven facets of awakening, the three gatewaysto liberation,And the unfolding and reversal of the twelve links of causation—Ignorance, formations, consciousness, name and form aggregations,Senses, contact, sensation, craving,Grasping, existence, birth, and aging and death.The code of conduct is to sustain the sublime ethical conduct of serenity andself-control.The result of no further training is the state of a solitary sage arhat, amiddle state of awakening.Solitary sages rest in the sphere of static peace for as long a period as theyspent cultivating goodness and wisdom.Then they are born in a lotus in a pure land of the manifest body ofenlightenment;After seven years, the lotus opens,The sages see the Buddha’s face, and they learn the great way.This concludes “Taking Refuge and the Lesser Way,” Book 7 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhistways of spiritual development.BOOK 8: THE FOUNDATION OF THE MIDDLE WAYOn the foundation established by the vows of refuge,The enlightened heritage’s meaning can be explained within the context of thegreat way’s uplift of the mind to that which is sublime.In lands of gods, nagas, and others,Shakyamuni taught a variety of disciplesHis final cycle of instructions, definitive ultimate truth.The original translations include Flower Ornament Discourse; Mound of JewelsDiscourse; Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse;Discourse Requested by the King, the Powerful Formula; Lion’s Roar ofShrimaladevi;Discourse Requested by the Girl Named Ratnadevi; Discourse Requested by theGoddess Vimalaprabha;Discourse to Help Angulimala; Discourse Requested by Maitreya; Discourse onBuddha Nature, and others—Ninety units in all. The new translations include twenty-four discoursesAnd forty treatises of commentary.From the perspective of ultimate truth, the qualities of buddha nature’sappearance aspectManifest as enlightenment’s bodies and pure lands;Its emptiness aspect’s qualities include the ten forces and four forms offearlessness.The primordial, ever-present, unchanging constituent of innate awarenessIs veiled by incidental stains—the delusion of dualistic clinging, karma, andmental afflictions.When these veils are purified, stainless qualities unfold.Buddha nature pervades all sentient life.The signs of this enlightened heritage having awakened are sight of existence’sfaults and of the qualities of perfect peace.Its supreme qualities liberate us from the sea of existence.The basic space of phenomena is the support; appearances, the content.The enlightened heritage can exist within impurity, purity, or extreme purity.Butter, a lamp, a jewel, gold, grain,And fruit: these six metaphors illustrate the basis, path, and result.A buddha within a lotus, bees and honey,Grain in a husk, gold in filth,A buried treasure, a sprout from a seed,A jeweled image in rags, a sovereign in the womb,Gold covered with earth: these are nine metaphors of the meaning.The basic space of phenomena, enlightenment, buddha nature, innate constituentenlightenment, ultimate truth,Radiant wisdom, emptiness, perfection of sublime insight, true nature.The innate constituent enlightenment can be believed in, partially seen, ormanifest.Empty of faults and formations, the enlightened heritage’s qualities arecomplete.Once the five mistakes are corrected, one works joyfully and energetically forthe good of others.Under the heading of relative truth, there is its essence, definition of theterm,Characteristics, and two categories of its classification—genuine andmisleading.On Vulture Peak, Powerful Sage (Shakyamuni)Turned the doctrine’s middle cycle, that of absence of characteristics,For those endowed with the great way’s enlightened heritage.His teachings compiled by Gentle Melody (Manjugosha), explained by Nagarjuna andhis spiritual heirs,And expounded by Shantideva are the profound view tradition.His teachings compiled by Loving Kindness (Maitreya), explained by Asanga andhis brother,And expounded by Lord Atisha are the vast activity tradition.Lotus-Born’s personal tradition concurs with the profound view tradition.The original translations have twenty-three discourses in this cycle, includingThe Lengthy Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand andTwenty-Five Thousand Stanzas,The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eighteen Thousand Stanzas, in Ten Thousand,Eight Thousand,Seven Hundred, Five Hundred, Three Hundred, and One Hundred Stanzas.The original translations also include 197 treatises of commentary.In a past life, the Sage offered a parasol, and seashells to the greatShakyamuniAnd in that buddha’s presence uplifted his mind to supreme awakening for thefirst time.He then traversed the paths of cultivation and application by honoringfifty-five thousand victors;He reached the seventh stage of awakening by honoring sixty-six thousandvictors;And completed the tenth stage of awakening by honoring seventy-seven thousandvictors.These three progressions lasted a total of three great incalculable eons.Thirty-four lifetimes from among the past lives of the Buddha:(1) Born into a brahmin family, he became a renunciant and kept a circle ofdisciples.Then, out of compassion, he gave his body to a tigress.(2) As king of Shibi, he gave whatever was wished:To a brahmin he gave his eyes. By his declaration of truth, he gained divinesight.(3) As king of Kosala,He remembered a past life and recounted that his position was the consequence ofa gift of warm food.(4) As the merchant Courage in Giving, he crossed the fires of hellTo offer alms to a solitary sage.(5) As the merchant Invincible, although his wealth was exhausted,He offered his profits from selling grass: the god blessed him with endless andincreasing wealth.(6) As a rabbit, he gave spiritual teaching to an otter, a jackal, and a monkey.He leapt into a fire: the gods gave him gifts and praise.(7) As the brahmin Agastya, when staying in retreat,His food became depleted; he offered leaves to his guest, Shakra.(8) As King Force of Love, by his gift of his own flesh and bloodTo five noxious spirits, they became the five excellent individuals.(9) As the prince All-Liberating, he offered everything—An elephant; then sons, daughters, and wife.(10) As King Maker of Gifts and Offerings, he skillfullyTurned his subjects away from wrongdoing and led them to joy and happiness.(11) As Shakra, he was left behind by the gods’ armies.To rescue a garuda, he turned around and scattered the demigods.(12) As a brahmin, his preceptor wished to test himAnd asked him to steal: when he refused, the teacher was pleased.(13) As a king, he desired an entrancing womanBut he bore what was unbearable and perfected patience.(14) As a traveler on an ocean ship blown off course,His declaration of truth returned it to home.(15) As a fish, to save the lives of fish when a lake dried up,His declaration of truth brought rain, saving them.(16) As a young pheasant, when the forest burned,His declaration of truth calmed the fire’s spread.(17) As Shakra, the force of his description of alcohol’s faultsLed the king, his court, and entourage to renounce alcohol and to applythemselves to ennobling acts.(18) As a wealthy man, he gave everything away and became a renunciant;He did not heed pleading to reconsider, but spoke of the many shortcomings ofhome life.(19) As a brahmin, his brothers, sisters, and servants all became renunciants.The lotus roots were hidden by Shakra, who asked forgiveness.(20) As a merchant chief, a minor event led him to retreat;He skillfully led his family and friends to renunciation.(21) As Crown Ornament Awakening, he and his wife became renunciants.He was not angry at the king, who became his servant.(22) As the king of geese, after he was caught in a trap,He gave spiritual teachings to the king and his officials, who offered him giftsand praise.(23) As Great Awakening, he skillfully led the king and officialsAway from negative views to the excellent path.(24) As an ape, he led someone who had fallen down a cliff to safety.When the man tried to kill him, he compassionately showed the path home.(25) As a sharabha, he led a killer, a king who had fallen down a cliff,To safety and had him enter the spiritual path.(26) As a spotted deer, a person he saved from being carried away by a torrentRecounted the event. The king’s army surrounded him but was tamed by histeaching.(27) As a monkey, he made a path with his body on the treetops,Thus rescuing the pack of monkeys from danger and inspiring faith in thekingdom’s people.(28) As Patient Speech, a kingProvoked by desire and anger cut off his limbs. The earth opened and the kingfell.(29) As Brahma, he taught the truth to a king who held wrong views:He was moved to faith and led his subjects to ennobling acts.(30) As an elephant, he showed the path to seven hundred persons who had beenexiled to the wilderness;To feed them he jumped into a ravine, thus saving their lives.(31) As Prince Moon, he persuaded Sudasa’s son to stop eating human flesh,Thus making everyone secure.(32) As a prince in an iron houseHe became disillusioned with life while at a festival and stayed in retreat.(33) As a water buffalo, when bullied in many ways by a monkey,A noxious spirit asked him questions and he expressed patience. The spiritdeveloped faith.(34) As a woodpecker,He relieved a lion’s pain. The lion forgot his kindness but the bird was praisedby the gods.The domain of equanimity is enemies, friends, and those you regard as neither.While wandering in the round of rebirth without beginning or end,Enemies have been friends and your friendsHave been enemies who caused you incalculable harm.If you treat enemies as friends, they will prove helpful.Help to friends is most often repaid with harm:Rest in equanimity toward others—those toward whom you feel attraction,aversion, or neither.There is no being who has not been your parent;At that time, they helpfully protected you with incalculable kindness.To return that aid, repay them with helpfulness.Endeavor to lead others to temporary and permanent happinessAnd to the causes of such happiness.Any place that space reaches is filled with beings;Beings’ lives are filled with the sufferings of ignorance, karma, and mentalafflictions;Thus they experience the causes and effects of suffering.Beings, our venerable mothers, are tormentedBy the causes and effects of suffering, and will never become free from theprison of existence.Consideration of their condition induces unbearable compassion.When seeing beings who act nobly and enjoy happiness,Feel more joy than if these things were your own:This will increase your joy until it becomes immeasurable.Biased meditation on those to whom you are related, your immediate circleOf relatives and fellow citizens, amounts to worldly love, compassion, joy, andequanimity.The support for uplifting the mind to awakening can be a person who has takenone of the seven kinds of individual liberation vows;Or, it is taught that even such beings as gods, nagas, or noxious spirits can doso.Classification by nature yields two, three, four, five, or six categories.The levels can be illustrated by twenty-two metaphors.The benefits of uplifting the mind to awakening are elimination of all fear andsuffering.You become a recipient for the veneration of all beings, including the gods.Your cultivation of ennobling acts becomes endless and ever increasing.That uplift forms the root or seed of spiritual life.It cures the sickness of suffering; it induces the dawn of wisdom.Your qualities increase and you quickly attain supreme enlightenment.To prepare, arrange sacred representations and many offerings.“I invite the host of transcendent victors and the victors’ spiritual heirsTo witness the uplift of my mind to sublime awakening:Please be seated on this throne and supreme seat in this fine, beautiful place.”“With body, speech, and mind multiplied to equal the atoms of all realms,I bow in homage to the spiritual master, and to the victors and their heirs.”“To the supreme host of recipients of offerings,I offer both real and imagined offerings—the seven offerings of common use, thepleasures of the five senses,The auspicious signs and substances, the seven precious possessions of amonarch,The three realms, the triple cosmos, and the splendor of realms filling space.”“I admit with regret any evil acts I have accumulatedBy the force of karma and mental afflictions throughout lifetimes withoutbeginning or end.”“I wholeheartedly rejoice in the cultivation of ennobling actsAnd the positive karma of every being, ordinary or exalted.”“For the sake of deluded beings, I request you to forever turn the supreme wheelof the doctrine,Which guides beings according to their needs.”“I request you to not transcend sorrow but to remainUntil the round of rebirth’s seas run dry.”“In order that all beings be liberated, I dedicate to sublime awakeningThis vast ennobling act generated by the twofold cultivation of goodness andwisdom.”The main ritual concerns the sublime mind of both aspiration and application:Aspiration is the wish to attain the state of enlightenmentFor the benefit of beings;Application is to undertake spiritual practice, the cause of that attainment.On bended knee, with hands joined in prayer, with intense faith and humility,repeat:“Until I reach the heart of awakening, I take refugeIn the Buddha, the doctrine, and the sublime gathering of the spiritualcommunity.Victors of the ten directions and your spiritual heirs, heed me!Just as the blissful buddhas of the past and their spiritual heirsUplifted their minds to sublime awakening and engaged in its training,I uplift my mind to sublime awakeningAnd will engage in its trainingFor the sake of all beings.“I will liberate listener and solitary sage arhatsWho are not free from cognitive obscurations and states of static peace;I will liberate ordinary individuals and exalted onesWho are not free from the two obscurations;I will give supreme release to those who are bound,Beings assailed by extreme torment in the three miserable existences;And I will place all beings in the transcendent state free of abiding,Beyond life’s wheel of interdependent arising.”“Today I have become a child of the victors;A recipient of honor by gods and humans; a supreme guide for beings;And one who has obtained the crowning name bodhisattva:In rapturous joy, I will aid beings.”The goodness of this is such that victors as numerous as the sands of the GangesCould not completely express it during eons as numerous as sands of the Ganges.This concludes “The Foundation of the Middle Way,” Book 8 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhistways of spiritual development.BOOK 9: THE PATH OF THE MIDDLE WAYAfter you uplift your mind to sublime awakening as described, you engage in allfacets of the training:Renew your commitment to awakened mind during the six periods of day and night.Employ various means to gradually removeEvery stain that obscures your innate constituent enlightenment, buddha nature.The three kinds of ethical conduct are restraint from faulty conduct,Gathering ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.Renounce the seven things that undermine these forms of ethical conduct; rely onthe three things that preserve its integrityAnd the nine things that enhance it. The classification and standard enumerationare as three.Two traditions present the vows of restraint from faulty conduct.The tradition of Nagarjuna follows The Discourse of the Bodhisattva Sky Essenceand The Discourse of Skillful Means,And is delineated in The Compendium of Training.Twenty fundamental downfalls and eighty reprehensible acts are as follows:Five definitely apply to rulers—to confiscate offerings to the three jewels, torenounce Buddhism,To punish ennobling practice, to commit any act of immediate fruition, and tohold wrong views.Five definitely apply to government officials—to destroy villages, provinces,Cities, towns, or surrounding areas.Eight definitely apply to ordinary persons—to speak of emptiness to those whoare mentally unprepared;To lead someone to the lesser way; to induce abandonment of the lesser way andadherence to the great way;To claim that the lesser way does not prevent mental afflictions in encouraginganother to adhere to your own beliefs;To criticize others and to praise yourself, driven by jealousy; to lie, for gainor glory;To cause a fully ordained individual to be punished and to accept a bribe;To disrupt a renunciant’s mental tranquility by confiscating their possessionsto give to a reciter of texts.The last two are to relinquish the aspiration to awaken or the application toawakening. Thus, there are twenty in all.Of the reprehensible acts, twenty-four concern disregard of happiness andsuffering;Sixteen, disregard of spiritual practice—A total of forty. These, differentiated by temporaryOr permanent disregard, give a total of eighty.Training in aspiration includes to not mentally abandon any being, to recall thebenefits of awakened mind,To cultivate stores of goodness and wisdom, and to be diligent in training inawakened mind.Renounce these four negative acts: to deceive those worthy of veneration, toprovoke regret,To criticize holy persons, and to deceive anyone.Practice their opposite, the four positive acts.The training in application includes renunciation of four fundamental downfalls:To criticize another and to praise yourself for gain or honor;To not give objects or spiritual instruction out of greed;To remain angry and abusive even though another has acknowledged a mistake;To present a false impression of yourself as a spiritual person after havingrenounced the great way.There are thirty-four and twelve reprehensible acts—forty-six in all.The ethical conduct of gathering ennobling qualities includes the sixtranscendent perfections,Their characteristics, literal meaning, classification, enumeration,Order, ways of practice, and benefits.The ethical conduct of altruistic acts is the four means to gather disciples—To summon disciples by means of the signal of generosity;To draw their attention by pleasant speech;To have them practice, according to their interests, the meaning of ways ofspiritual development;And to conform to that meaning, thus putting them at ease.During the four forms of activity—walking, sitting, eating, and sleeping—Be circumspect, exercising vigilance and mindfulness,As described in the collection of The Discourse of Perfectly Pure Conduct.Recite with pure motivation prayers of aspiration that relate to yourcircumstances.The four parameters are actual downfalls, apparent downfalls,Nondownfalls, and apparent nondownfalls.The seven corrupting acts of body and voice are permittedIf they will surely help another. In that case, they are ennobling.In Nagarjuna’s tradition, the means to acknowledge downfalls is as follows: if afault has exceeded the period,It can be repaired by praying at dawn to the bodhisattva Sky Essence.Additional downfalls can be purified by recitation of The Discourse of the ThreeAggregations at the six junctures of the day.In Asanga’s tradition, the fundamental downfall is to abandon another being;Auxiliary downfalls, to commit one of the four negative acts or to damage youraspiration or application.One defeating act can be motivated by great, medium, or lesser degrees ofinvolvement.These relate to varying degrees—to commit the act continually, without shame orembarrassment,To be pleased by it, and to consider it positive.If a defeating act has been committed, the vows must be taken again.Acts done with a medium degree of involvement must be admitted before threepersons.Acts done with a lesser degree of involvement must be formally admitted beforeone person.If this is not possible, admit the act mentally in the presence of the victors.At the outset of training in the six transcendent perfections for the sake ofbeings,Recognize that all beings have been your mother and recall their kindness.Decide to repay their kindness and help them reach happiness. You have theopportunity to guide them.Do what you can. Have compassion. Uplift your mind to awakening. See them as thefocus of your spiritual practice.Helping others will accomplish your own goals, please the buddhas,Provide aid, and do so without difficulty. Marshal the four forces.See yourself and others as equals and exchange yourself for others.Generosity can be expressed to needy beings through material gifts, the gift ofspiritual teaching, and the gift of refuge from fear.Material generosity can be expressed through giving any wealth desired;Great giving—your child, spouse, or other loved ones;Or extreme giving—your head or limbs.Lesser spiritual generosity is expressed through gifts of paper, ink, or books;Great spiritual generosity is given by teaching appropriate ways of spiritualdevelopment.Generosity of refuge from fear is to provide freedom from danger.The three kinds of ethical conduct are restraint from faulty conduct,Gathering ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.The three kinds of patience are to accept suffering, to not dwell on harm done,And definite realization of the teachings.Patience constitutes supreme goodness, the most exemplary ascetic practice.Anger causes rebirth in the hells: you should avoid it.Things that cause harm are numerous: it is difficult to neutralize them all.If you only discipline your mind, you will neutralize all negativecircumstances.By using harmful circumstances, you perfect patience.Think of the kindness of enemies; feel gratitude toward them.Harm, disturbance, and suffering arise from your karma:To discipline karma’s source, your mind, is vital.If the situation can be changed, why be unhappy?If no change is possible, of what use is sadness?The object of anger and the angry individual lack an intrinsic nature and arenaturally empty.If there is no intrinsic self, what self is there to cling to? What cannot betolerated?The three forms of diligence to be undertaken are the armor of intention,application to acts,And joyful service to sentient beings.Three kinds of laziness must be rejected: attachment to negative acts thatshould be renounced,Inertia, and underestimating yourself.Diligence attracts praise from worldly people and leads to achieving goals,The increase of every quality, and the quick attainment of enlightenment.All worldly and transcendent fortune and excellenceAre achieved through energetic diligence: develop enduring and enthusiasticdiligence.Renunciation of distraction and busyness are requisites for the practice ofmeditative stability.Sensual pleasures and possessions are impermanent: remain in isolated places.To accumulate, guard, and search for possessions causes suffering;Vanity, craving, and greed lead to the miserable existences.Companionship with spiritually immature persons increases wrongdoing and cloudsyour ennobling acts.Such persons are difficult to please, have many plans, and foster arguments—suchfriendships are like poisonous snakes.Until you gain stability, life in your homeland is deceptive.Always remain in retreat on a pleasant mountainside.In retreat, various experiences and realizations naturally arise.Seven steps toward retreat surpass an eon of offering to the victors.In the main practice of meditative stability, assume the seven-point postureAnd rest the mind focused on an object, such as the form of the Buddha.Practice the meditative stability of the spiritually immature—The four levels of mental stability and the four formless levels;Full discernment of the meaning; and the sacred noble meditative stability ofthe blissful buddhas.Know the differences between these three meditative states—For those who have not entered the path, for those who have entered it, and themeditative state of exalted bodhisattvas.The nine ways of placing the mind, the ten discordant influences,The six impediments, and the eight remedial mental formations,And three meditative states—magic, warrior’s movement, and vajra-like—Result in the qualities of divine sight, clairvoyance, and miraculous powers.The view is the self’s lack of intrinsic nature, the meaning free fromformulation.Sublime insight gained in hearing the doctrine, and in reflection and meditationupon itEstablishes that view, overcomes accumulated mental afflictions, and leads totranscendence of existence.Hearing concerns analysis and what is analyzed.Analysis that reveals the true state is definitive meaning;Analysis that reveals the means to enter the basic character of being isinductive meaning.Intention and indirect intention elucidate these two meanings.Intention comprises intention directed toward evenness, other meanings,Other times, and individuals’ attitudes.Indirect intention comprises indirect intention in respect to entry into theteaching, characteristics,Antidotes, and interpretation.What is analyzed—phenomena—reflects either relative or ultimate truth.Relative truth, the appearing state, is inaccurate or accurate.Inaccurate grasping of inaccurate appearances is misleading relative truth.Correct relative truth does not deviate from the result: it is the wisdom of thepath’s basis.It does not deviate from the attainment of the result, the form bodies ofenlightenment, with their wisdoms.Ultimate truth is the true state of the basic character of being,Subjective experience, the nature of reality, and the basic character of beingarise interdependently.The outer and inner phenomena of the round of rebirth arise interdependently.To guide beings, the buddhas demonstrated the interdependent origination of thetranscendence of sorrow.To accept and nurture fortunate disciples, reflect upon the words and meaningstaught.Examine the scripture and reasoning used in debate to stem misleading beliefsystems.Examine your experience in reading the composition of extensive or brief clearand profound texts.Use thorough analysis to arrive at certainty in any subject.As in a dream, phenomena have not come into being:In the sleep of ignorance, dreams of deluded perceptions arise.Without clinging to the myriad objects, subjects, and collections of thoughtsthat appear,Meditate that they are like dreams.As in a magical display, phenomena do not cease.There are four modes of magic—natural magic,Impure magic, skillful magic, and wisdom magic.Meditate having reached definite understanding through the examples of magic.As in an optical illusion, phenomena do not draw near.As in an optical illusion, form, sound, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, andphenomenaAre completely devoid of reality.Develop skill in this and settle free from discursive thought or recollection.As in a mirage, phenomena do not go:They don’t arise, cease, or remain, like a mirage.Regard joy or pain, affirmation or denial, and dualistic clinging to be like amirage.Settle free from hope or fear, and from the mind’s outward or inward movement.Like the reflection of the moon on water, phenomena are free from nonexistence:While they appear, they are empty; while they are empty, they appear.Know all clinging to the reality of phenomena—appearances, sound, thought,clinging, existence, nonexistence—To be just the empty appearance of a reflection.As in an echo, phenomena are free of permanence:All sounds, of praise or of blame, pleasant or unpleasant,Have neither basis nor source, and not the slightest intrinsic nature.Meditate that whatever appears is like an echo.As in an ephemeral city of spirits, phenomena are not multiple.From the moment such a city appears on the plain at twilight, it has nointrinsic nature.Likewise, delusion’s perceptions within the round of rebirth are unreal.Familiarize yourself with the meaning of that.As in an emanation, phenomena are not singular:Meditate that what arises—the environment, beings, karma,Mental afflictions, suffering, the stages and paths of awakening, and anyappearance—Has in itself no inherent existence.On the subject of meditation, the path of cultivation includes the support,nature,Cause, result, and four points to describe the essence—Characteristics, example, classification, and special attributes.The duration of the path can be thirty-three, seven, or three incalculable eons.The special attributes are antidotes, renunciation, realization,Qualities, and meditation, both general and specific.On the lesser path of cultivation you meditate on the four recollections—Recollection of body, sensation, mind, and phenomena.On the middle path of cultivation, you meditate on the four genuinerenunciations—To not develop corrupting qualities that have not yet arisen, to stem thosewhich have,To develop ennobling qualities that have not yet arisen, to increase those whichhave.On the higher path of cultivation, you meditate on the four supports formiraculous powers—The supports of the meditative states of aspiration, diligence, mind, andconduct.The explanation of the path of application describes its support and nature.Its nature has cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics,definition,And a classification—heat, peak, forbearance, and supreme qualities—and specialattributes.You meditate on heat and peak with the five powers—Faith, diligence, mindfulness, meditative states, and sublime insight.You meditate on forbearance and supreme qualities with the five forces.The path of application’s special attributes are its antidotes, renunciation,Realization, qualities, and superiority when compared to the path ofcultivation.An explanation of the path of seeing describes its support and nature;Its nature has cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics,example,Classification, and special attributes. Its classification has the sixteeninstants and the seven aspects of awakening—Mindfulness, analysis of phenomena,Diligence, joy, extreme skill, meditative states, and equanimity.Its special attributes are the antidote, renunciation, time, realization, andqualities.The enumeration has characteristics, classification, and the way ofrenunciation.Classified according to essence, there are six; according to misunderstanding,ten;Or according to what is renounced on the path of seeing, one hundred and twelve.The special qualities are that in one instant,You see one hundred buddhas, you receive one hundred buddhas’ blessings,You go to one hundred pure lands and receive instruction for one hundred eons,Your wisdom comprehends one hundred lifetimes, such as those in the past orfuture,You enter into one hundred meditative states and bring one hundred beings tospiritual maturity,You move one hundred realms, illuminate one hundred realms,Open one hundred doors to spiritual instruction, and teach in one hundred forms,Each form surrounded by one hundred disciples.The fault of greed is purified and the transcendent perfection of generosity iscompleted.On the stage of Intense Joy, you take the form of the ruler of this world, theLand of Jambu.The explanation of the path of meditation describes its support and nature;Its nature, cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics andexample.On the levels of the path of meditation, its lesser, middle, and higher stagesAre each divided into three—the path of meditation’s nine stages:Immaculate, Illuminating, Radiant, Difficult to Refine,Manifest, Far Reaching, Unmoving, Excellent Intelligence.The path of meditation’s ninth stage is the tenth stage of awakening, Cloud ofthe Doctrine.The ten stages of awakening correspond to the ten transcendent perfections:generosity, ethical conduct,Patience, diligence, meditative stability, sublime insight, skillful means,force,Aspiration, and wisdom. The ten things renouncedAre greed, lapsed ethical conduct, anger, laziness,Distraction, wrong understanding, unskillful acts,Obscured force, unfulfilled aspirations, and cognitive obscurations.At the nine stages, the path of application and the path without interruptionare antidotes of renunciation;In the main part of a stage, the path of complete liberation is the antidote ofthe support;And at the end of a stage, the special path is the antidote of distance.Four hundred and forty aspects of the mental afflictions and cognitiveobscurations are renounced.At awakening’s first stage, the mind’s luminous nature is realized in evenness.At the second, what you have realized is realized to be supreme, and you clearaway impurities.At the third, you are diligent in hearing the doctrine to realize the basicspace of phenomena.At the fourth, you renounce attachment without clinging to the self.At the fifth, you realize that the innate constituent enlightenment in your ownand others’ minds is not separate.At the sixth, through realization of the natural purity of the innateconstituent, you rest without clinging.At the seventh, you overcome clinging to traits through nonseparateness.At the eighth, through realization of the unaltered essence, you gainforbearance of the unborn nature of phenomena.At the ninth, you realize that the innate constituent inherently has individualawareness.At the tenth, you realize the innate constituent to be a source of enlightenedactivity and you master the four powers.The qualities at the first stage of awakening are twelve times one hundred.Increasing, at the second, to twelve times one thousand.At the third, twelve times one hundred thousand.At the fourth, twelve times ten million.At the fifth, twelve times one thousand ten million.At the sixth, twelve times one hundred thousand ten million.At the seventh, twelve times one hundred thousand million times ten million.At the eighth, twelve times the atoms in one hundred thousand cosmos.At the ninth, twelve times the atoms in one hundred thousand incalculablecosmos.At the tenth, qualities will appear equal to twelve times the atoms ofinexpressibly numerous realms.At the second stage, you take birth as the wheel-monarch of the four continents;At the third, as Shakra; at the fourth, as the ruler of the Sumaya gods;At the fifth, as the ruler of Joyful Heaven; at the sixth, as the ruler of theHeaven of Joy in Creation;At the seventh, as the ruler of the Heaven of Control of Others’ Creations;At the eighth, as Brahma, general chief of a simple cosmos;At the ninth, as Great Brahma, chief of a double cosmos;At the tenth, as Great Vishnu, chief of a triple cosmos.At the tenth stage, the eightfold exalted path entails correct view, thought,speech, action,Livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and meditative states.Bodhisattvas at the point of culmination make offeringsTo all victors of the ten directions. From all the victors’ foreheadsThe supreme luminosity empowerment dissolves into the crowns of thebodhisattvas’ heads.They attain vajra-like and other meditative states,Numbering incalculable hundred thousands. These end their cognitiveobscurations:The qualities of their innate constituent are actualized and they attainenlightenment.This concludes “The Path of the Middle Way,” Book 9 of The Invaluable Treasuryof Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhist ways ofspiritual development.BOOK 10: THE RESULT OF THE MIDDLE WAYUpon reaching the end of training in and traversing the paths and stages ofawakening, and the twofold cultivation, as described,The path of no further training is reached. It is explained through adescription of its support and nature.Its nature has cause, result, and essence; its essence, characteristics andexamples.The essential wisdom body abides in the nature of reality, supreme purity andevenness.The body of ultimate enlightenment, the qualities of the innate constituentenlightenment fully manifest,Has twenty-one groups of wisdom’s qualities:(1) Thirty-seven facets of awakening—four foundations for mindfulness,Four correct renunciations, four supports for miraculous powers,Five powers, five forces, seven aspects of awakening,And the eightfold exalted path.

and permanent, continual time.Created manifest forms of enlightenment include statues and texts.Incarnate forms of enlightenment manifest in various forms to guide others.Supreme manifest bodies of enlightenment display the twelve acts of buddhas:(1) Descent from Joyous Heaven, (2) entering the womb, (3) birth,(4) Education in skills, (5) life with a circle of queens, (6) disenchantment,(7) Ascetic practices, (8) travel to the place of awakening, (9) defeat of thedemons’ armies,(10) Enlightenment, (11) turning the wheel of the doctrine, and (12)transcendence of sorrow.The content of enlightenment, wisdom, is twofold—knowledge of the natureOf the basic space of phenomena, free from the extremes of formulation ofobjects of knowledge;And precise knowledge of the multiplicity of phenomena in the round of rebirthand transcendent states.Four wisdoms—mirrorlike, evenness,Discerning, and all-accomplishing—are explained through their essence,complement, and function.Some middle way philosophers contend that enlightenment has no wisdom.Some mind only philosophers contend that knowledge does not include appearances.Some materialist philosophers contend that wisdom sees delusion’s perceptions.In enlightened beings’ self-manifest experience, personal deluded perceptionshave been purified so they do not see them.However, they know entirely the causes and results that appear in the deludedperceptions of ordinary beings’ experience of reality as other-manifest, Likethe fable of someone awake who enters the dream path of a sleeping person.They know the nature of reality as it is,They know manifestly the illusory nature of phenomena,And they know the three times unobstructedly and instantaneously.Although no objects of knowledge exist, they dwell within the sphere of wisdom’sactivity.Although things are not real, buddhas know them to exist as false.Until the end of the round of rebirth, enlightened activity’s timely deedsWork in skillful, appropriate ways to guide others.They aid beings effortlessly, as shown clearly by nine metaphors.To all fortunate persons, enlightened activity appears instantaneously, like thesun,Teaching disciples according to their karmic perceptions.Those without a karmic connection hear nothing, like deaf persons.The special renunciation is the purification of the two obscurations, with theirrelated habitual patterns.The special realization is the pure vision of all phenomena.The special qualities are the wheel of adornmentsAnd the sixty melodic qualities of the Buddha’s speech: soft, gentle,compelling,Agreeable, pure, faultless, clear, sweet-sounding, pleasing, and calming—thefirst ten.Worthwhile, unassailable, not harsh, not inflexible, restrained,Pleasing to the ear, to the body, and to the mind; gladdening, and pleasing—thesecond ten.Never troubling, to be known, to be understood, clear, heartening,Exhilarating, comprehensive, informative, coherent, relevant—the third ten.Not repetitive, forceful, trumpeting, thundering, sounding, melodious, like adivine bird,Like the voice of Brahma, like a chakora bird, and like the lord of the gods’voice—the fourth ten.Like a drum, not vain, not degraded, consistent, not deficient,Not incomplete, not timid, not weak, completely joyous, and encompassing—thefifth ten.Not rigid, fluent, impressive, complete, satisfying, irreproachable,Reliable, not rushed, resounds everywhere, and supreme—the sixth ten.This concludes “The Result of the Middle Way,” Book 10 of The InvaluableTreasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidates all Buddhistways of spiritual development."},{"pageContent":"THE OUTLINE: BOOKS 1 TO 10The Wish-Fulfilling Vine [05_toc-title.html#head_30]image [images/chapline.jpg]PROLOGUENamo shriratna trayaya adanamahéna sharanam madramIllustrious three jewels, to you I bow and take refuge with utmost respect!The new dawn of your exquisite wisdom body, sublimely resplendent, is wreathedin the radiant rays of the marks and signs of a buddha’s physical perfection.The symphony of Buddhist teachings, falling like rain from the clouds of yourmelodious wisdom speech, brings all beings to spiritual maturity.The sky of your brilliant wisdom mind holds in its embrace the enchantingconstellations of the planets and stars of love and wisdom.May you, victors in infinite numbers and your spiritual heirs, generously bestowupon us a virtuous celebration of common and supreme accomplishments.I respectfully bow to the mighty sage Shakyamuni’s sublime wish-fulfilling tree,source of benefit and happiness:Its roots are firmly planted in the uplift of your mind to awakening, a vastfoundation of compassion and of altruistic acts.Its branches, aspects of your awakening, flourish in the space of incalculableeons during which you cultivated goodness and wisdom.Its ripened fruit, supreme awakening, falls in a rain of the eighty thousandteachings, filling every container, the minds of beings.The best speakers, suns of oratory, teach according to the interests of theiraudience;Their excellent explanations have been conscientiously collected in theexcellent canon and treatises in Tibetan translation.The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra unites these in a singlecomprehensive text that provides useful clarification for every Buddhist way.The subject of this book, an outline of the contents of this outstanding work ofoutstanding qualities, will elucidate its difficult vital points.THE SUBJECT REFERRED TO here, the sublime ambrosia of the sacred doctrine, isfound in the treatise entitled The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra toTantra.

Develop disillusionment toward the realms of existence!Why should you feel any such disillusionment? While circling within the round ofrebirth since time immemorial, the number of bodies you have assumed as aninsect and then discarded, if collected together in a heap, would tower abovethe king of mountains, Supreme Mountain. The tears you have shed would exceedthe waters of the four oceans. During the infinite number of lifetimes you havebeen a hell being or a starving spirit, the molten copper, blood, pus, marrow,and mucus you have drunk would surpass the waters of every river that flows fromthe four continents into the sea. The number of heads, eyes, limbs, fingers, andtoes you have lost due to your desires equals the number of finest atoms ofearth, fire, and wind in realms as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.Concluding VersesIn the three worlds’ frightful imprisoning trench,The three bonds’ ropes hold you tightly,And the three sufferings’ punishments torment you continually.The three miserable existences’ weapons are very sharp and painful.On this wide plain of the round of rebirth’s unending anguish,Birth, aging, sickness, and death’s sharp thorns pierce you;Heat, cold, hunger, and thirst’s barren earth and stone surround you;Myriad sufferings’ savage, wild animals attack you.The mountains of flesh, bones, limbs you have discarded rise high;The oceans of blood, pus, and tears you have shed measure deep;The bodies of your various karmic rebirths swirl like fine atoms:How sad, this dense darkness of ignorant folly!BOOK 7: TAKING REFUGE AND THE LESSER WAYI bow to the three whose guidance leads to a gloriously joyful mind:The omniscient Teacher, master of the ten forces;The teachings, the sacred doctrine of realization and of the scriptures ofdiscourses and tantras;And the upholders of the teaching, the spiritual community—bodhisattvas,hearers, and solitary sages.This homage introduces Book 7 of this excellent text, “Taking Refuge and theLesser Way.” This book has four chapters:1.

Theintroduction has three parts: the meaning of the text’s title, an expression ofhomage, and the resolve to compose the text. The main text has three parts: abrief presentation, the extensive explanation, and a summary. The conclusion hasthree parts: the text’s benefits, prayers to dedicate the goodness of the text’scomposition and of aspiration, and how the book was composed, accompanied by anexpression of auspicious wishes.THE INITIAL VIRTUE OF THE INTRODUCTIONFirst, the meaning of the title has two parts. First, persons of the highestdegree of acumen understand the content of a text just by having been shown itstitle.Second, the Sanskrit title can be rendered in Tibetan and English as follows:sutra can be rendered as mdo, discourse(s); tantra can be rendered as rgyud,tantra(s); ratna can be rendered as rin po che’i, invaluable; koka can berendered as mdzod, treasury; nama can be rendered as zhes bya ba’i, known as;shastra can be rendered as bstan bcos, treatise. In Tibetan, the title ispronounced “do gyu rinpoché-i dzö” and is translated into English as TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras.Second, sutra refers to the verbal expression that encompasses every meaningfound in the three collections of the cause-based, common way of transcendentperfections. Tantra, meaning continuum, refers to the three continuities—of theground, path, and result—that appear as tantras expressed in words, theextraordinary fourth collection. These tantras comprise the entire content ofthe result-based vajra way of secret mantra. Invaluable refers to aninconceivably valuable jewel of sovereign power that showers a rain ofeverything that is needed and desired. Treasury refers to a treasure house ofmeasureless dimensions, filled with a varied collection of such jewels. Thetreatise known as refers to the name given to the work whose contents correspondto this title, a treatise distinct from the six flawed genres of non-Buddhisttexts, and which is written in the three styles characteristic of Buddhisttreatises that synthesize the vast canon.Third, this title is given to the work that combines the title’s indication ofthe content—discourses and tantras—and its metaphor—a treasury.Second, the expression of homage has two parts. First, to Buddha Ever Excellent,the glory of all the round of rebirth and transcendent states in common,throughout the appearing aspects and circumstances of the ground, path, andresult, I sincerely bow with intense humility. This expresses an offering ofhomage.Second, this section has three parts. First, male and female Ever Excellent, theoriginal spiritual lord protectors, attained enlightenment before all otherbuddhas, victors over the four demons’ assaults; and they personify the body ofultimate enlightenment’s wisdom, primordial purity, the total pacification ofdualistic formulations.The body of ultimate enlightenment’s natural fullness is ever present as thesupreme wisdom body of perfect rapture. Its forms include the five male and thefive female victor chiefs of the five wisdom clans (vajra, jewel, lotus, action,and transcendent buddha); and the peaceful and wrathful deities, the centralteacher and circling retinue inseparable, endowed with the five certain featuresand who reside within their self-manifest realm, the ultimate great Highest PureLand.Within the ongoing state of the body of perfect rapture, myriad forms ofenlightenment’s manifest body appear. These include victors who appear to theirentourage of tenth-stage bodhisattvas within the five natural pure lands ofmanifest enlightenment, including the pure lands of wrathful deities; the sixsages, who guide the six kinds of beings; billions of sublime manifest wisdombodies who in every universe display a buddha’s twelve acts; and forms thatguide beings according to their needs—as sacred statues, texts, or religiousmonuments; as such things as jewels, wish-fulfilling trees, food, clothing, orhomes; or as such beings as rulers, hunters, or prostitutes.Although these victors, the three wisdom bodies, appear separately, they areinseparable within the unchanging essence wisdom body. I respectfully pay homageto all who epitomize these wisdom bodies.Second, I bow to Buddha Shakyamuni, the fourth enlightened guide, praised asbeing like a white lotus, supreme Lord of the Shakyas, teacher of gods andhumanity, the unsurpassably kind master of the doctrine. Further, I bow to theprecious master from Oddiyana (Guru Rinpoche), who unites in his single form allvictors of the ten directions—their wisdom mind’s omniscience, loving nondualcompassion, enlightened acts, powerful capability to give refuge and everyblessing.I bow to the refuge of the sacred doctrine, perfectly expressed by all victorsin the three collections of scripture—the exemplary speech in the canon’sdiscourses and tantras—and the doctrine of passionless realization of the truthof the spiritual path of the three trainings and of the truth of cessation.I bow to spiritual guides on the correct path who belong to the communities ofthe great and lesser ways, who uphold the precious doctrine of the Victor who isendowed with ten powers. They do so by hearing it, and reflecting and meditatingupon it. They preserve the doctrine by removing contradictions to logic and theBuddha’s word and by affirming what is consistent with them; and they spread thedoctrine through teaching, debate, and composition.Third, in the experience of disciples, those who surpass all buddhas are theVictor’s regents replete with every holy quality. These supreme treasuries ofthe blessings of nondual compassion include spiritual masters who manifestlydemonstrate deep kindness in the present day and those who belong to pastsuccessive lineages.The infinite sacred circles of peaceful and wrathful victors who appear in thefour categories of tantras’ hosts of deities resemble massive treasure vases ofboth supreme accomplishment—final enlightenment—and ordinary feats, whichprovide temporal fulfillment of wishes.The mothers who gave birth to all victors, the hosts of wisdom and activitydakinis and powerful celestial travelers of the three regions—below, on, andabove the ground—assist with a mother’s love, a sister’s affection, and aservant’s respect those who have taken tantric bonds. The guardians of thevictors’ doctrine of discourses and tantras—the seventy glorious protectors andthe hosts of proud spirits of the eight tribes of gods and demons—wield theauthority to perform the four major activities—pacifying, enhancing,magnetizing, and overpowering.May they all spiritual masters, deities, dakinis, and guardians crown our headsand be supremely victorious!Third, the following resolve motivates the writing of this text: May Ienergetically collect from every source the meaning of the key instructionscontained in the ocean of the doctrine of the Victor’s discourses, tantras,treatises of commentary, and pith instructions; and the profound substance ofelegantly written, authoritative texts in general and such works as the seventreasuries by Longchenpa. May I gather their substance and meaning within asingle work entitled The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, andelucidate them within its twenty-five books; the books’ one hundred and onemajor chapters; and the chapters’ two thousand, one hundred and seventy-ninespecific headings.THE CONTINUING VIRTUE OF THE MAIN TEXTThe main text has three parts: a brief presentation, the extensive explanation,and a summary.First, this section has three parts.

In particular it offersan explanation of the basis of each of the tantras of secret mantra—theempowerments that ripen the recipient’s mind and the tantric bonds, thelife-force of tantric practice; the tantric path—the view, meditation, andconduct; and the time and form of the result attained. The treatises that spreadfrom this one, like limbs from a body, elucidate many of the subjects in thisexceedingly varied list.To summarize the general structure of the subjects found in the main text, itdescribes three aspects of the path: certainty in the view, experientialcultivation in meditation, and enrichment in conduct.Individuals who foster exertion in hearing the doctrine and in reflecting andmeditating upon it based on this excellent text will reach unbounded proficiencyin its subjects and thus, the rank of erudition. They will be able to nurturefortunate persons through accurate teaching of the words and meanings of alldiscourses and tantras; to defeat in debate those who express misleadingopinions; to provide in composition extensive or brief commentary on thesubjects found in the canon; and to perform other related deeds. Suchindividuals will be appreciated by those of every social rank and will meet withcomplete success.Therefore, initial development of understanding of the words’ meanings resolvesdoubts. Later, experience in the cultivation of meditation on the intendedmeaning instills supreme certainty. Finally, once you reach the fortress ofrealization, you experience the liberation of appearing phenomena withinthemselves. In brief, hearing this text and practice of it will continuallynurture the cultivation of every positive quality and culminate in the swiftaccomplishment of your personal goal, attainment of the perfect peace of thebody of ultimate enlightenment, and the welfare of others, attainment of the twowisdom bodies that have form. This attainment will result in infinite servicefor boundless numbers of beings.BOOK 1: DISCIPLESHIPThe extensive explanation of the main text contains twenty-five books, of whichthe first is “Discipleship.” This has four chapters: “The Characteristics ofQualified Spiritual Masters,” “The Characteristics of Worthy Disciples,” “TheStages of Spiritual Apprenticeship,” and “Forsaking Misleading Companions.”Chapter 1 has eight parts, of which, first, the extensive explanation beginswith a description of the general characteristics of spiritual guides. Becausesuch individuals, holy lord protectors, lead the worldly, their acts outwardlyresemble those of all persons. However, because they ultimately transcend thisworld, they are unlike all others: compared to anyone, they are remarkable inmany ways. Their acts and demeanor are pure, unblemished by any fault. Theyguide all beings on the correct spiritual path through a variety of skillfulmeans.Second, supreme wish-fulfilling spiritual masters exhibit pervasive compassion,expertise in methods to guide disciples, and mastery of the treasury of oceansof sacred literature contained in the discourses and tantras. They resemble aship that crosses the wide sea of existence; and a captain who steers toward theentrance to the correct path. They are a fine gem that relieves those destitutewithin existence. They extinguish the fires of karma and mental afflictions:they resemble a pacifying river and a cloud that rains the sacred doctrine. Theyare a mighty divine drum that brings joy to all beings. They are an adept healerwho cures the fatal sicknesses of the three poisons, a bright lamp that dispelsthe darkness of abject ignorance, a wish-fulfilling tree that bestows allhappiness and fortune, an exquisite, wide treasure-vase that yields everythingdesired, a new dawn instilled with universal love, and a moon that eases theheartache of mental afflictions. Respectfully approach supreme spiritual masterswho, like the wealth god Son of Renown, bestow the riches of every positivequality.Third, spiritual masters whose qualities are naturally complete are born to agood family; have all senses, such as sight, intact; and are discreet since theyare both extremely considerate of others and cautious of subjects they know willembarrass others. Their love and compassion for all are limitless; their sublimeinsight, vast; their deportment in body, speech, and mind, naturally restrained;and their learning, extensive. They exercise utmost patience in the face ofanger and are naturally honest and straightforward.Fourth, spiritual masters liberated from existence have turned their backs onworldly life. They live far from their homeland, and since they feel faintattachment to wealth, possessions, and objects, they do not undertake activityfor the sake of this life. Their belief in the causes and results of positiveand negative acts makes them circumspect in their renunciation of corruptingacts and in their practice of ennobling acts. They have abandoned concern forthis life’s happiness and comfort and instead strive for mastery in meditationpractice or accomplish what is very meaningful for the long term (that is,future lives).Fifth, spiritual masters of vast sublime insight have pervasive understanding ofevery subject of study. Learned in both the words and meaning of eachphilosophical school’s tenets, they have arrived at a pure understanding of theview. Their conduct is exemplary. However you might examine them, you can detectnothing reprehensible. They do not invent their own style but adhere to thetransmission of the canon. They are endowed with a deep, clear, and very livelyintellect. They thoughtfully examine the level of disciples before teaching themprofound instructions according to their intellectual capacity.Sixth, spiritual masters who uphold the lineage of a successive line ofaccomplished masters have received the profound instructions of the aurallineage. They practice purely and are skillful in ways to accomplish the twogoals—their own and others’ benefit—that they pursue energetically. Because theyhave attained accomplishments from many sources, they are able to transformothers’ experience. They have inherited the transmissions of the discourses andtantras, and guard purely the tantric bonds.Seventh, spiritual masters who compassionately lead on the path have trained inthe great way’s awakened mind and continually work to help others. The sign thatblessings have entered their stream of being is their ability to bless others’perceptions. They show skill in the signs of meditative heat in the experienceof the view, meditation, conduct, and result. Endowed with powerful capability,they eliminate obstructive negative forces and guide others skillfully.Eighth, any connection to spiritual masters who reveal the ultimate meaningbrings you to the profound, direct path. They reveal the meaning of the heartessence, the abiding nature, by introducing you to your own mind as the body ofultimate enlightenment and they reveal profound instructions that greatly enrichthat experience. Their supreme mastery of ultimate realization allows them toaccompany disciples to the realization of the ways things are, the abidingnature, the ground of being. Since they can employ many levels of methods, theytransform any circumstance into the spiritual path and are thus skillful inliberating others’ streams of being. Their mind’s breadth spans the sky; theirmeditative states equal the sun’s brilliance; their wisdom, the ocean’s depth;and their nondual compassion, a mighty river’s flow. Unmoved by distraction,they resemble a snow-covered mountain; forever steadfast, a towering mountain;untainted by life, a blossoming lotus; in equanimity toward every being, aparent; replete with qualities, a vast treasure; and able to lead beings toenlightenment, a victor. For beings of the time of degeneration who aredisinclined to spiritual life, their great kindness surpasses that of anybuddha.Chapter 2 has two parts. First, unworthy disciples to be rejected have neitherfaith nor modesty. They frequent shameful places, feel faint compassion, anddisplay the major faults of character of those with bad backgrounds. Theirconduct is vulgar; their connection to spiritual life is faint. Their corruptingacts and five poisonous mental afflictions are coarse. They do not discriminatebetween ennobling acts and wrongdoing and they disregard their vows and tantricbonds: their positive influences are faint. They are particularly foolish,small-minded, difficult to please, and always short-tempered and argumentative.They never apply any of the teachings they receive to their own stream of being,but harbor the aberrant intention to sell them to others. The mound of negativeeffects that result from not examining a prospective disciple could provedetrimental to Buddhism.Second, disciples with a fortunate connection to spiritual life are endowed withfaith, energy, and vast sublime insight. They always exercise caution,mindfulness, and thoughtfulness. They correctly honor their vows and tantricbonds. They never disobey the spiritual master’s commands; they are calm anddisciplined, and have supreme loving-kindness. They are open-minded and mentallystable, and have strong devotion and pure perception.Chapter 3 has two parts. The first section has six parts. First, the six reasonsto remain inseparable from and to continually rely upon spiritual masters are asfollows:Spiritual masters provide profound and lastingly useful advice.Second, spiritual masters relieve every suffering through instruction in how toadopt ennobling acts and to reject wrongdoing; thus they open your eyes tosublime insight and illuminate the path to complete freedom.Third, only spiritual masters can provide the highest support for the swiftcultivation of goodness and wisdom—this is a very important feature.Fourth, because spiritual masters give sure refuge from every suffering of lifein general and from the miserable existences in particular, it is worthwhile torely upon them as the foremost refuge.Fifth, for individuals without qualities, ordinary and special qualitiesgenuinely develop by reliance on spiritual masters and they cause these toincrease.Sixth, in this dark time of degeneration, it is extremely rare to find anyonewho exceeds spiritual masters as teachers of the profound and wide-rangingnectar of Buddhist instruction.Second, how to rely upon spiritual masters has nine parts. First, in whatevercountry or region qualified, holy spiritual masters live, strive to find them asyou would eagerly search for rare and very useful food or wealth.Second, you must realize that whatever spiritual masters do—gently or angrily,meaningful or not, major or minor—is guided by their exceptional wisdom mind.Third, you must respectfully honor non-Buddhist ascetics, powerful guardianrelatives and friends, warriors who accompany you to the end of dangerous paths,your country’s rulers, teachers of crafts and other subjects, healers who cancure your sicknesses, and companions who share their food or money. Reflectingupon these examples, you should consider if there is any reason to not rely uponspiritual masters, who are even more helpful.Fourth, please masters by offering without attachment the following gifts:delicious and sweet food; beautiful and luxuriant clothing; useful materialthings; various precious kinds of grain and wealth, such as gold and silver;fine houses; fields; vehicles, such as horses, elephants, and chariots; suchvery beloved persons as your children, spouse, or servants; all your specialwealth and possessions; sacred representations of wisdom body, speech, and mind;and the finest medicine.The fifth section has two parts. First, to please masters physically, bow, offervarious gifts, and perform circumambulations. On the masters’ behalf, travel orlive where asked and perform all the major and minor tasks they request.Respectfully serve, wait upon, and attend to spiritual masters by preparingtheir seat and so on. Protect them from such dangers as those of fire or water,ravines, wild animals, and enemies. In these and other ways, please them throughphysical acts.Second, wrong physical behavior to be renounced in the masters’ presenceincludes carelessness, disrespect, scowling, frowning, clapping your hands,turning the side of your body to them (that is, not facing them), stretchingyour arms or legs, lying down, fighting with others, frivolity, playing games,spitting or cleaning your nose, and stepping over the master’s hair or clothes.The sixth section has two parts. First, to please masters verbally, makerequests with pleasant words; praise the masters’ body, speech, and mind; bepolite; do what the masters have said; continually pray to them; relate toothers the masters’ qualities and life story; answer honestly; take refuge inthe masters; and examine your own speech.Second, renounce such wrong verbal behavior in the spiritual masters’ presenceas lies, slander, idle talk, harsh language, disobeying their commands, andtalking back.The seventh section has two parts. First, to please masters mentally, alwaysremember their kindness and qualities. Continually develop the attitude that themasters, difficult to meet, are greater than the Buddha. When recalling theiracts, tremble and cry. Consider that just to see their face, hear their voice,recall them, or be touched by their hand is a very meaningful event.Second, renounce negative mental attitudes such as lack of faith, wrong viewstoward the masters’ acts and behavior, anger, critical attention, contempt,competitiveness, pride, and coveting their wealth.Eighth, when the masters’ order arrives, “Devote yourself single-mindedly tomeditation practice!” stay in retreat, abandon all forms of busyness, raise dayand night the banner of single-minded practice of the heart of meditation,uphold the tradition of past holy masters, and actualize the fruit of certainaccomplishment.Ninth, inconceivable numbers of benefits accrue from correct discipleship: youraccumulation of faults, your heap of shortcomings, and every pain and weaknessend; a great treasure of a mass of favorable qualities, talents, meditativeexperience, and realization overflows; and you bring benefit and happiness toBuddhism and beings.Chapter 4 has seven parts. First, the reasons misleading, negative companionsmust be forsaken are described as follows: in general, befriending fools divertsyou from the correct path. Deficient in all fields of knowledge, you unwittinglycome to lead an ordinary, meaningless life.Second, by befriending faithless and apathetic persons, you neglect meditationpractice and your devotion fades.Third, by befriending those of the lesser way, you consider only your ownwelfare; you long for peace and happiness for yourself alone; and you abandonundertaking significant acts for others’ benefit.Fourth, by befriending those with neither the correct view, meditation on theprofound path, nor meditative experience stable enough to be unaffected byevents, faults spread from your having become distracted from what has deepmeaning. By befriending those whose bodhisattva training or monastic vows havelapsed, you become contaminated by the shadow of their violations. Bybefriending those who persist in ordinary, deluded, conventional thinking, youstray from the sense of the nature of mind. By befriending those acquisitive offood, wealth, or property; loners and those who have given up helping others;those who have diverged into a nihilistic view of emptiness; or those attachedto the literal meanings of words, you become influenced by the mistake of eachand only manage to talk about Buddhism without this being followed by anymeaningful result.Fifth, befriending the unintelligent clouds sublime insight gained from hearingthe doctrine and reflection upon it. Befriending the hateful disturbs your mindand subverts your character. Befriending the lustful fuels craving for theobjects of desire. Befriending the proud increases the major faults ofpartiality, prejudice, and dualistic attachment. Befriending those who areexceedingly jealous fosters the torment of competitiveness.Sixth, befriending those so attached to this life that they feel neitherdisengagement nor disillusionment toward the round of rebirth; those who impartvarious forms of worldly advice or guidance; those who seek amusement, such assinging and dancing, and follow fashions; those who wield power and influence;those who deeply crave wealth; profiteers in food or jewels; butchers or thosewho act evilly; those who act deceptively; or those who do various kinds of actsboth positive and negative contaminates you with the reprehensible behavior ofeach.Seventh, misleading companions undermine lasting happiness and lead you to theextreme suffering of the round of rebirth’s miserable existences. Therefore,examine your acquaintances as you would a refuge, a guide, or an article youbuy.The benefits of forsaking misleading companions are that your cultivation ofennobling acts increases; you do not regress; and you accomplish an array ofexceedingly numerous qualities within acute mindfulness, meditative absorption,and sublime insight. Further, this life and the next will be happy: you willalways proceed in happiness toward the highest happiness, the state ofenlightenment.This concludes the commentary to the words of “Discipleship,” Book 1 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall Buddhist ways of spiritual development.BOOK 2: THE TRANSMISSION OF BUDDHISMBook 2, “The Transmission of Buddhism,” has three chapters: “How Buddhism IsTaught,” “How to Listen to Buddhist Teaching,” and “An Exposition of Faith, theFoundation of the Doctrine.”Chapter 1 has nine parts. First, genuine spiritual masters teach the sacreddoctrine in the following manners: Buddhas teach by employing threemiracles—they create interest by performing various miracles of magicalemanation; they purify and prepare their disciples’ minds through the miracle ofcomprehensive expression; then they produce a rain of instructions, the miracleof relevant teachings, according to their disciples’ interests.Arhats teach by employing the three purities: the teacher’s speech is pure; thelistener is a pure recipient; and the subjects of the exemplary teaching arepure.Among scholars, those trained at the illustrious Nalanda Monastic College taughtthe canon according to the five magnificent aspects of instruction and thetreatises according to the five initial considerations.The five magnificent aspects of instruction are the magnificent setting,teacher, instructions, entourage, and time of the instruction. The five initialconsiderations identify the teacher, the scriptural sources from which theteaching is compiled, the category of teaching to which it belongs, for whosebenefit it is given, and provide a brief synopsis of the text, from beginning toend.This treatise can be described according to these criteria: (1) The author isLongchen Choying Tobden Dorje Mapam Choklé Nampar Gyalwa, a noble person who hasgained confidence from hearing the Joyful Buddha’s excellent speech, andreflecting and meditating upon it. (2) This text is compiled from scripturalsources in both the cause-based way of characteristics and the result-basedsecret mantra way. (3) This treatise belongs to natural great perfectioninstructions, specifically great perfection’s branch that provides an entrancefor persons on the eight levels of spiritual practice based on the rationaldualistic mind to the ninth, final stage, atiyoga. (4) This treatise is writtento provide an escort to accompany fortunate persons of present and futuregenerations, both those individuals who develop gradually and those who reachimmediate realization. (5) To provide a brief synopsis of the text frombeginning to end, the root text and commentaries to The Invaluable Treasury ofBuddhist Discourses and Tantras can be summarized as texts that reveal thebasis, path, and result of Buddhist practice; or the view, meditation, andconduct. These subjects can be synthesized in three stages—how to enter thepath, the actual path, and its ultimate result. They are elucidated in thetext’s 25 books, 101 chapters, and 2,179 headings.To make the listener a worthy recipient for the teachings, scholars trained atVikramashila Monastic College described the outstanding qualities of the master,author of the text, the outstanding qualities of the work he or she wrote, andhow to teach and listen to teachings imbued with such qualities.Second, this section has two parts. First, the five elements of teaching methodsare the purpose, the summary, the literal meanings, the connections, andrefutations of challenges. First, the purpose of a specific teaching has fouraspects described here in relation to this text: the subject—any essentialintent of the canon, treatises, and pith instructions; the purpose—to facilitateeasy and thorough understanding of the main text and subsequent correctexperiential cultivation for fortunate individuals of present and futuregenerations; the innermost purpose—so that these individuals can attainenlightenment and lead all beings to that state; and the progression—these threeaspects are related, the latter to the former.The summary is elucidated in the text The Wish-Fulfilling Vine (the outline),which lists this treatise’s books, chapters, and headings. Third, literalmeanings are clarified by concise and extensive commentaries to the words of theroot text. Fourth, the connections are provided by the words that introduce andconclude the books. Fifth, as an example of refutation of challenges, if it weresaid, “Your Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra does not include allthe words contained in the discourses and tantras,” this challenge could berefuted by, “In this work I present an original correct, comprehensiveexplanation of every essential subject contained in the discourses and tantras.”Second, this section has two parts. First, tantras can be explained in manyways: six explanations of meaning—the general meaning, the concealed meaning,the final meaning, the auxiliary meaning, the meaning of the words, and themeaning of the pith instructions; six parameters—explanation of the definitivemeaning, provisional meaning, implied meaning, unimplied meaning, literalmeaning, and not literal meaning; or four methods of interpretation—the meaningof the words, the general meaning, the concealed meaning, and the final meaning.Many other systems of explanation are specific to individual levels within thefour categories of tantra.The four streams of transmission of the original translations are the stream ofthe expository scriptures, the stream of blessing-empowerments, the stream ofthe aural lineage instructions, and the stream of the practical application ofenlightened activity.Presentation of the structure of the meaning, an outline of the main text,word-by-word commentary, and synopsis of the pith instructions are four otherstyles of explaining these tantras. “Presentation, explanation, and summary”refers to the brief presentation, the extensive explanation, and the summary.Second, great perfection tantras are explained by describing six elements: (1)the essence—which it is forbidden to alter; (2) definitions which depict theenlightened heritage and continuity; (3) two divisions—the natural, ultimatetantra and the symbolic, verbal tantras; (4) scope—ten tantras which focus onthe phase of creation, eight on the phase of completion, eighteen on integrationof these two phases, and five on great perfection; (5) examples—like a cord madeof cloth fashioned from many threads, one meaning can be presented through avariety of words; and (6) proof—such as those which prove the tantra byillustrating the continuity (the word tantra literally means “continuity”) ofthe ground of being.The extensive explanation of the verbal tantras includes analysis of thefollowing eighteen tantras:1. The Unimpeded Sound Tantra—the key-like tantra2. Self-Manifest Awareness—the ocean-like tantra3. Self-Liberated Awareness—the tantra like a knotted snake4. Self-Arisen Perfection—the river-like tantra5. The Lion’s Full Strength—the tantra which dominates by its brilliance6. Auspicious Beauty—the wheel-like tantra7. The Exquisite Design of Gems—the tantra like molten gold8. The Pearl Garland—the tantra which presents the series of pith instructions9. Wordless—the tantra like the king of mountains10. The Mirror of Vajrasattva’s Heart—the sun-like tantra11. The Mirror of Ever Excellent’s Wisdom Mind—the swordlike tantra12. The Union of Sun and Moon—the tantra like the relationship between motherand child13. Elaborate Introduction—the mirrorlike tantra14. The Blaze of the Holy Form—the tantra which is like reaching the capital15. The Heap of Jewels—the tantra like a treasure vault16. The Blazing Lamp—the tantra like a piercing spear17. The Six Expanses—the seventeenth, the tantra like a great garuda soaringeffortlessly in space18. Black Wrathful Goddess—the eighteenth, the razor-like tantraSelf-Manifest Awareness, Self-Liberating Awareness, and Wordless are the threeessential tantras; The Mirror of Ever Excellent’s Mind, The Mirror ofVajrasattva’s Heart, and The Exquisite Design of Gems, the three nectars; ThePearl Garland, Auspicious Beauty, and Completion of the Lion’s Strength, thethree flowers. Self-Manifest Awareness encompasses all tantras; the tantra whichplumbs their depth is Elaborate Introduction; and the tantra which turns backthe assault on wisdom is The Union of Sun and Moon. The two auxiliary tantrasare The Heap of Jewels and The Blaze of the Holy Form. The tantra of the yoga ofliberation is The Blazing Lamp; the heart-like tantra is The Six Expanses; thesecret text we follow is The Unimpeded Sound Tantra; and the weapon-like tantrais Black Wrathful Goddess.These tantras’ benefits are as follows. When you memorize these texts, you areintroduced directly to awareness itself; when you preserve them, you restdirectly in meditative states; when you read them, their contents’ meaning dawnsin your mind; when you teach them, you attain common feats and supremeaccomplishment; when you meditate on them, the round of rebirth empties from itsdepths; when you listen to them, you enjoy temporal wisdom.If these texts are explained according to the analytical methods of the tantras,the three certain subjects are expounded; if taught according to thetransmissions, the five magnificent aspects of instruction; if taught accordingto the pith instructions, the basis, path, and result. They can also be taughtaccording to the collection of twenty-three precious examples and thewish-fulfilling tree of the five principles.Third, in the setting or region of Varanasi, the teacher Shakyamuni taught thefirst cycle of the doctrine, the four truths, to the entourage of the fiveexcellent individuals and eighty thousand gods, for the period of seven yearsafter his attainment of enlightenment. In the setting of Vulture Peak, theteacher Powerful One of the Shakyas taught the middle cycle of the doctrine,that phenomena have no self-existent characteristics, to a common entourage ofhearers and an extraordinary entourage of bodhisattvas for a period of thirtyyears. In various settings, such as the abodes of gods and nagas, and at Rajgir,the teacher, Mighty Sage, taught the final cycle of the doctrine, theenumeration of definitive meaning, to an entourage of extraordinary groups ofdisciples for a period of ten years. Thus, the Buddha turned the wheel of thedoctrine’s three cycles, comprising the four collections—on the monastic code,the discourses, on observed phenomena, and on supreme observed phenomena. Eachcollection contains twenty-one thousand teachings, a total of eighty-fourthousand aggregations of the teachings, the extent of the canon.The first compilation of the canon occurred during the summer following theBuddha’s transcendence of sorrow (that is, his passing away): Ananda compiledthe discourses; Upali, the monastic code; and Mahakashyapa, the collection onobserved phenomena. The second compilation occurred eighty years after theBuddha’s transcendence of sorrow: the arhat Upagupta compiled the threecollections. The third compilation occurred close to four hundred years afterthe Buddha’s transcendence of sorrow; it was done by the bodhisattva Sumitra andthe arhat Purnika.The series of seven patriarchs of the doctrine began with the elderMahakashyapa, to whom the Buddha entrusted his teaching. He in turn entrusted itto Ananda, who entrusted it to Shanavashin, who entrusted it to Upagupta, whoentrusted it to Dhitika, who entrusted it to Krishna, who entrusted it toSudarshana.On the subject of the treatises, during the Buddha’s lifetime, seven arhatscomposed the seven texts on observed phenomena. At the time of the secondcompilation, five hundred arhats, including Upagupta, composed The GreatTreasury of Detailed Explanations. The six ornaments, the two supreme teachers,and others composed various treatises such as these: Nagarjuna composed suchtexts as The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight; Maitreya composed fivetexts—the two ornaments, the two distinctions, and The Highest Continuity.Asanga composed five treatises on the stages of awakening; Aryadeva, The FourHundred; Vasubandhu, The Treasury of Observed Phenomena; Dignaga, TheCompilation on Logic; Dharmakirti, the seven texts on logic; Chandrakirti,Entering the Middle Way; Shantideva, Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas;Chandragomi, Chandra’s Grammar; Acharya Vira, The Past Lives of the Buddha; andGunaprabha, The Root Discourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct.The six styles of commentary are the following: commentary on words, commentaryon meanings, commentary on distinctions, extensive commentary, commentary on thedifficult points, and commentary on the legends.The three methods of instruction guide through instruction based on the words bythe erudite; instruction based on the meanings, by adepts; and instruction basedon experience, by the realized.Fourth, of the texts in the canon and treatises translated into Tibetan, thereare 210 discourses; 907 tantras; 536 treatises of commentary on the discourses;and 2,781 commentaries on the tantras—a total of slightly over 4,400 texts.Fifth, prepare the throne for spiritual teaching, a seat, a canopy, banners, aparasol, various forms of music, assorted offerings, such as the universe in theform of a mandala, all arranged attractively. After having taken the seat forteaching, uplift your mind to awakening and teach coherently and appropriatelyfor the occasion, with pure enunciation and pleasant-sounding words.Sixth, when teaching the common three collections, meditate clearly on yourselfas the Buddha Powerful One of the Shakyas; when teaching the outer or innerinstructions of secret mantra, on yourself as a principal buddha of the fivewisdom clans; and when teaching great perfection, on yourself as the Buddha EverExcellent. In each case, imagine that your adamantine tongue produces the soundof the doctrine in the melody of Brahma. This reaches beings who fill the limitsof space, wakes them from their sleep of ignorance, and causes the unfolding ofthe naturally manifest positive qualities of indwelling awareness, their innateconstituent enlightenment, buddha nature.Seventh, just as different diets are followed by infants and adults, subjects ofteaching must be determined in relation to the audience: To beginners, teachsuch subjects as death and impermanence, actions and their consequences, and theflaws of the round of rebirth; to those who have entered the path, teach thegraded paths of the lesser and great ways; to those who work for others’ good,teach such subjects as cosmology and the five major subjects of Buddhistculture; to groups of scholars, teach a general outline of philosophy; tospecial disciples, teach the tantras; to those who have supreme fortune, teachthe very profound essential meaning; for those of dull or foolish dispositions,instruction in faith and purification of obscurations is advised.Eighth, while teaching, generosity is practiced by the correct explanation ofwords and meaning; ethical conduct, by freedom from the faults of mentalafflictions; patience, by forbearance of grief and fatigue; diligence, byenthusiastic teaching; meditative stability, by remaining undistracted; sublimeinsight, by making distinctions between the words and the meanings.Ninth, goodness can be dedicated as follows: “By the power of the excellentstores of ennobling acts of teaching, hearing the doctrine, and reflecting andmeditating upon it, may all beings, with me, in every lifetime, always attainthe supreme good fortune of enjoying the ten ennobling acts and the ten forms ofspiritual conduct.”The benefits of correct teaching as described are as follows: you recollect pastlives; meditative states and self-confidence increase; mental afflictions arestilled; you preserve the treasury of the doctrine; you receive teaching fromthe Buddha; gods and human beings praise you; your fame increases; you achieveyour goals; you are not separated from the teachings in every lifetime; and youvery rapidly attain enlightenment and will then rain the teachings upon beings.Chapter 2 has five parts. First, when listening to the sacred Buddhist doctrine,offer a mandala and a mass of offerings; bow; then sit straight or kneel, withfolded hands. When conducive conditions for teaching are gathered, listenrespectfully without distraction.Second, when listening, avoid styles of attention which resemble three faults ofa vessel: the mouth of the vessel turned upside-down, a base which leaks, andinner poison; six impurities: pride, lack of faith, lack of interest, outerdistraction, inner self-absorption, and listening with distress; and thirty-sixshortcomings: six acts of obstructive influences, six acts which causeobscurations, six causes of abandoning the teachings, six faults of distraction,six faults of wrongful lack of principles, and six forms of spiritualitycontrary to the great way.Third, pure motivation is maintained through appreciation of the six preciousattitudes, forbearance of six hardships, six armors unaffected by circumstances,six goals, six necessities, and six ways to seek instruction.Fourth, when listening to the teachings in the proper manner with eighty-fourways of hearing, the mandala and other offerings constitute generosity; controlof body, voice, and mind, ethical conduct; forbearance of difficulty, patience;enthusiasm, diligence; continual attention, meditative stability; clarificationof misunderstandings, sublime insight.Fifth, at the conclusion of the teaching, reflect on the spiritual master’skindness, and within an appreciation of the magical nature of all phenomena,dedicate to the attainment of awakening the cultivation of ennobling acts ofhaving listened to the teachings.The benefits of having heard the sound of the conch which trumpets the doctrineinclude liberation from the miserable existences; increase of discernment forthose who have heard the instructions; attainment of flawlessly retentivememory; increase of ennobling acts; diminishment of wrongdoing; praise from godsand humans; and swift attainment of enlightenment, after which you will turn theunsurpassable wheel of the doctrine.Chapter 3 has eight parts. First, styles of faith in positive, ennobling actsare described as follows: yearning faith stimulates the desire to renounce theround of rebirth, the yearning to attain the freedom of awakening, and the wishto undertake the conduct that causes both those results. Devoted faith leads todedication to supreme ideals—you feel devotion to the spiritual master as theone to be approached, enlightenment as your goal, the Buddha’s doctrine as yourpath, and the spiritual community as your companions. Respectful faith leads youto outstanding conscientiousness—physically respectful, you act in a restrainedmanner, such as performing prostrations and circumambulations; verballyrespectful, you express praise, speak politely, and offer your service; andmentally respectful, you bow humbly upon seeing a venerable person or object.Lucid faith uplifts the mind to positive qualities—you are uplifted by therelative appearances of ennobling acts, by the ultimate virtue of sublimeinsight, and by the ennobling act of their integration. Trusting faith endsdoubts concerning the basis, path, and result of the teachings: you gainconfidence that the causes and effects of the round of rebirth must berenounced, that the causes and effects of the transcendent states must becultivated, and that acts of uncertain effect are unnecessary. Certainty infaith toward the excellent doctrine leads to application in hearing thedoctrine, reflecting, and meditating upon it.Second, the nature of faith resembles a fertile field where the stems ofawakening sprout; a ship that crosses the sea of the round of rebirth; an escortwho provides protection from the danger of your enemies, the mental afflictions;a vehicle on the path to freedom; a jewel that accomplishes your wishes; and awarrior who eradicates corrupting acts. Therefore, you should value faith asyour greatest wealth.Third, without faith, you are like a stone on the ocean floor: you will notreach the dry land of freedom. You are like a ship without a captain: you willnot cross the river of suffering. You are like an armless person who has reachedan island of gold: qualities will not enter your stream of being. You are like aburnt seed: the fruit of awakening cannot grow. You are like the blind within atemple: you cannot see the appearance of spirituality. You are like cleverpersons whose worldly abilities plunge them to the depths of the round ofrebirth: you wander forever within that round.Fourth, yearning faith arises from disillusionment with life’s suffering.Devoted faith arises from disillusionment with the behavior of evil companions.Respectful faith arises from disillusionment with the appearances of this life.Lucid faith arises from contact with those who represent pure, supreme ideals.Confident faith arises from hearing of the karma and consequences of ennoblingacts and wrongdoing. Certainty in faith arises from all forms of hearing andreflection.Causes that increase faith include relying upon holy persons; befriending noblecompanions; examination of the texts of discourses and tantras; reflection ondeath, and acts and their consequences; and increased effort in hearing andreflection. These factors cause faith to continually increase. To hear the storyof a holy person’s life of freedom; to suffer harm from disease, demons, orenemies; to witness death; to experience sudden suffering: as these eventsprovoke the arousal and strengthening of faith, they are very valuable.Fifth, conditions that cloud faith include consideration of spiritual masters’faults, befriending common persons, increased craving for the pleasures of thefive senses, acute laziness and apathy, preoccupation with the affairs of thislife, and undertaking activity detrimental to your spiritual life. The signs ofdemons’ blessing are to feel no devotion or humility toward the three jewels.Sixth, indications of the arising of faith include disillusionment with anyactivity within the round of rebirth; deep humility toward the three jewels;exertion in hearing the doctrine and reflecting upon it, training, and vows; thepractice of ennobling acts and the renunciation of wrongdoing; and the arisingof various new positive qualities within your stream of being.Seventh, your faith should remain free from six inconsistencies—to have faithwhile with the spiritual master but none when apart; to have faith whencatalysts are encountered but none otherwise; to have faith while you accomplishyour goals but none once finished; to have faith toward one ennobling practicebut not toward others; to not have any instruction or master in whom you have nofaith but to easily accept anyone and anything; and to have some small eventprovoke faith and some small event diminish it.Instead, your faith should have ten special qualities: it should be unchanging,like the sovereign mountain; it should have clarity without shadows, like thesun; it should have endless depth, like the ocean; it should be without anulterior motive, like a mother; without limit or center, like space; withoutrelaxation, like a bow-string; without fatigue, like a ship; undisturbed byevents, like a bridge; continual, like a stream; and humble and supple, like asilken cord.Eighth, the benefits of faith include increase of positive qualities, relieffrom all suffering, finding the path to freedom, protection of benevolent gods,success in all your projects, and the rapid attainment of enlightenment: faith’sbenefits are infinite.This concludes the commentary to the words of “The Transmission of Buddhism,”Book 2 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a workthat elucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 3: OUR PRECIOUS HUMAN LIFEBook 3, “Our Precious Human Life,” has four chapters: “A General Explanation ofthe Difficulty of Attaining a Free and Fully Endowed Human Life”; “A SpecificExplanation of the Difficulty of Finding Such a Life, Based on Examples andNumbers”; “Identification of the Nature of the Leisure and Endowments of HumanLife”; and “The Need to Fully Grasp the Essence of Human Life Now That You HaveIt.”Chapter 1 has two parts. First, the supreme contemplation of those who hear thedoctrine with faith focuses on a jewel valuable beyond all measure—the excellentfree and fully endowed human life. This is extremely difficult to find anywhereamong the six kinds of beings. In this present moment of having it, you are likea blind person who has found a gem on open ground. You must therefore joyfullygrasp its essence.Second, this section has five parts. First, meditate joyfully that you haveattained an exemplary, untroubled life, free from these eight unsatisfactory,restless states based in your own stream of being: If you were now born in thehells, you would experience unbearable sufferings of heat and cold. If born as astarving spirit, you would experience severe exhaustion by hunger and thirst. Ifborn as an animal, you would experience measureless suffering as a dumb andfoolish beast of burden. As a long-lived god in the form or formless realm, youcould not even conceive of the practice of the doctrine. If born amongbarbarians in the hinterlands, you would live without ennobling acts and in thesteady increase of wrongdoing. If born mute or mentally handicapped, you couldnot comprehend language or symbols. If born among those who hold wrong views,you would abjure correct views. If born during dark eons during which a buddhadoes not appear, you would live in ignorance of the subject of ennobling acts toundertake and wrongdoing to reject.Second, avoid these eight restless states due to immediate circumstances: Tocommit corrupting acts due to the turmoil of the five poisons; to fall under theinfluence of evil, misleading companions due to foolish and deluded thinking; tofall under the influence of the demons of mistaken view and conduct due to thewrong choice of a spiritual path; to become distracted by indolence, althoughyou had intended to further your spiritual training; although you are diligent,to be tormented by misfortunes when the wide lake of your bad karma overflows;to belong to the class of servants who are not free but live helplessly inothers’ power; to strive for materialistic goals because you have entered thegateway to spiritual practice to gain this life’s food and clothing; and toengage in spiritual practice only for gain, fame, or honor since your spiritualpractice is contrived.Third, the eight restless states due to unconducive attitudes are as follows: tobe bound by the cords of attachment to family, friends, food, or wealth; to havean ignoble behavior and character so spiritual practice is unprofitable; to feelno fear toward the sufferings of the miserable existences and of the round ofrebirth; to feel no faith whatsoever toward positive ennobling acts; your actsin thought, word, and deed consist of corrupting wrongdoing; to never considerthe qualities of the sacred Buddhist doctrine, ennobling acts, or the threejewels; to have broken the vows of individual liberation or those of awakenedmind; and to have violated the principal and secondary bonds of secret mantra.It is crucial to be free from these twenty-four (three groups of eight) restlessstates.Fourth, it is possible to apply yourself to the doctrine when five personalendowments are complete: to have attained a pure human birth because yourprevious spiritual training and ennobling acts have been awakened; to have beenborn in a central country where the doctrines of Buddhist teaching and practicehave spread; to possess the supreme, conducive condition for spiritualconduct—all your senses are intact; to feel inclined to ennobling acts, so thatyou do not transgress the laws of karma; and to feel faith in the sanctuary offaith, the precious three jewels.Fifth, the five social endowments are as follows: the twelve teachers ofunsurpassable great perfection, from Buddha Noble Son to Buddha Shakyamuni, haveappeared in this world; they have turned the wheel of the Buddhist doctrine’sdiscourses and tantras’ nine ways of spiritual development; the durations of thediscourses’ doctrine in general and that of the tantras in particular have notexpired; many have entered the Buddhist spiritual path and accomplished whataids themselves and others by correctly practicing its instructions; and aqualified spiritual master accepts you and a faithful benefactor supports you.These five social endowments together with the five personal endowmentsconstitute the ten conducive endowments: now that they are complete, you canaccomplish your long-term goal.Chapter 2 has two parts. First, for example, to obtain the precious human birthis even rarer than for a turtle who comes to the surface of an ocean once everyhundred years to stick its head through the hole of a yoke adrift on the openseas. It is more difficult to be born with a body possessing these qualitiesthan for beans to sprout on the surface of a plastered wall. It is even rarer toattain a human birth than for a mustard plant to grow from seeds thrown on thepoint or the eye of a needle.Second, concerning number, if the number of humans is likened to daytime stars,the number of animals equals the stars at night. Or, if animals are the daytimestars, starving spirits are the stars at night. Or, if starving spirits are thedaytime stars, hell beings equal the stars at night. In these metaphors—daytimestars and nighttime stars—the former is far outnumbered by the latter. It issaid that animals fill the oceans like the fermented grains left after beer hasbeen brewed; starving spirits cluster like snowflakes in a snowstorm; and hellbeings are as numerous as the particles of dust on the earth.Chapter 3 has three parts. First, mere human beings have no notion of eitherennobling acts or wrongdoing and their ripening; consequently, their continualevil, corrupting behavior leads them in future lives to fall into the infinitedepths of the miserable existences, without the opportunity for freedom.Second, special human beings, either householders or practitioners, confoundennobling acts and wrongdoing in their deportment—sometimes they act in accordwith the doctrine, but mostly act in a materialistic manner. At death, they havenothing but the seed of freedom rather than freedom itself.Third, precious human beings are the supreme support or recipient for thecorrect practice of Buddhism. Through diligent application dedicated exclusivelyto hearing the sacred Buddhist doctrine and reflecting and meditating upon it,they tame their own minds and then energetically guide others to the true path.The victors have praised this life and proclaimed it to be the sublime supportfor spiritual practice.Chapter 4 has seven parts. First, correct Buddhist practice depends on the mind;the mind depends on this free and fully endowed human life. Therefore now thatall the conducive causes and conditions are gathered, make subduing your ownmind the focus of your Buddhist practice.Second, now that you have it, ride the great ship of the free and fully endowedhuman life to cross the wide sea of existence’s unbearable suffering. If you donot make this exemplary life a vessel for the teachings, you will be tormentedfrom now on by many sufferings within the round of rebirth.Third, like returning empty-handed from an isle of jewels, to waste this humanlife in various meaningless acts is unconscionable. Since time immemorial, thesufferings of existence have fallen like rain, due to the fault of notreflecting on the difficulty of attaining this human life. The attainment of theprecious human body provides the sacred support for the doctrine of the lesserand great ways, the discourses and tantras, as well as the stages of the pathsof hearers, solitary sages, arhats, the victors’ spiritual heirs, and thesublime victors. Therefore, grasp the essence of this life and always meditatejoyously.Fourth, spurn materialistic, meaningless negative acts. Renounce everyunnecessary activity related to both lay and monastic life, such as farming inthe fields, entertaining family and friends, accumulating a fortune, givingcounsel concerning this life’s affairs, and supporting sectarian philosophies.Fifth, when you have the finest, smartest horse, you travel fast along your way.When warmth, moisture, and manure are gathered, you plant the seeds you have.When warriors’ troops assemble, you defeat your enemies. When a mine of silveror gold opens, you take whatever you can. When autumn crops ripen, you harvestwhat you can. When accompanied by a guide in a dangerous place, you try to leaveit. When you have borrowed equipment, you use it energetically. When servantsare working, you accomplish your work. Just as these conditions facilitateachievement of their related activity, you should energetically make your humanlife meaningful now, since impermanence will soon arrive.Sixth, when moving about, sitting, standing, lying down, and so on, abandon sixfaults—indolence, complacency, apathy, distraction, busyness, and any act notcertain to bring peace to your body, speech, or mind. Like the hungry seeingfood; the thirsty seeing drink; the destitute, wealth and possessions; doctors,medicine; parents, their only child; or those in danger, any refuge they canfind, energetically practice every form—elaborate or simple—of the cultivationof ennobling acts.Seventh, energetic reflection as described on the difficulty of attaining a freeand fully endowed human life leads you to forsake the concerns of this life, toconcentrate on the next life, and to spend this life busy in the practice ofennobling acts. With diligence like a blazing fire, you will quickly liberateyourself from the ocean of existence; you will hold the victory banner offreedom.This concludes the commentary to the words of “Our Precious Human Life,” Book 3of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work thatelucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 4: REFLECTION ON DEATH AND IMPERMANENCEBook 4, “Reflection on Death and Impermanence,” has five chapters: “A BriefPresentation of Impermanence,” “The Extensive Explanation of Impermanence,”“Examples to Illustrate Impermanence,” “Advice to Be Diligent Because ofImpermanence,” and “The Measure of Signs of Success in Meditation onImpermanence, and Its Benefits.”Chapter 1: Although you have attained this exemplary, free human life, sodifficult to find, it is in fact impermanent, like a jewel happened upon in adream. Since this life’s seemingly real body and possessions are impermanent intheir minutest detail, even your body will change into another.Chapter 2 has five parts. First, no feature of the environment—such as theconfigurations of the four elements, Supreme Mountain, the four continents,lesser continents, sun and moon, and the iron mountain ranges—nor any being ofthe six kinds in the billions of realms in the universe is permanent, since allundergo the four stages of the world’s formation, duration, destruction, andvacuity. Therefore, how can this bubble-like body be permanent?Second, if great individuals, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, the planets, nagas,noxious spirits, universal monarchs, and others imbued with glowing power,wealth, and glory are subject to impermanence, this illusory body of negligiblegoodness will surely soon pass away.Third, the guide of this world’s beings, Mighty Sage (Shakyamuni); the Victor’sspiritual heirs, the assembly of bodhisattvas; hearers; solitary sages; and thecircle of disciples, along with the sublime doctrine, have previously appearedin infinite numbers but all without exception were subject to impermanence;therefore this life, like dew, cannot possibly last.Fourth, after birth, death is certain; but the time of death, its place, and itscauses are not. Many things, such as sicknesses, weapons, or poisons, causedeath; few things prolong life. It is impossible to add time to life—life isspent instant by instant; it is impossible to stay.Fifth, at death, such things as home, possessions, family, strength, abilities,or a mass of supporters are all of no use. Therefore, it makes sense from now onto abandon projects related to this life’s deluded perceptions and to strivesingle-mindedly at the practice of the sacred Buddhist doctrine.Chapter 3 has two parts. First, members of a family and close entourage gatheredin one household are like shoppers in the marketplace—each eventually goes hisor her own way. Old or young, it is uncertain who will have to depart first tothe next world. Therefore, everyone should always avoid animosity or quarrelsand be dedicated to ennobling acts.Second, your body is like a tree on a steep riverbank; the Lord of Death is likethe water that erodes the earth that holds the tree. Your body is like adecrepit house that can easily collapse. Your body is like an old tree trunkprecariously perched on a cliff. Your body is like dry wood, quickly burned.Your body is like autumn flowers, easily dried. Any sound is like thunder orechoes, not followed by anything. Like clouds, fog, and rainbows which dissolve,outer appearances and inner thoughts easily disappear in an instant. Like thesetting of the sun and moon, or the extinguishing of a flame, this life’sappearances all disappear—they are impermanent.Chapter 4: At death, the three jewels and your stores of ennobling acts willsurely prove helpful. Rely upon holy persons, and in everything you do, whethersitting or moving, remember death as a means to inspire yourself to Buddhistpractice. You should guard this as the heart of your experiential cultivation.Chapter 5 has two parts. First, by repeated reflection on death, you will seethe destructibility of composite phenomena: your diligence increases and youabandon pursuit of this life’s activity. You have not even an instant of leisuretime to dwell in meaningless, mundane projects—disillusionment with life in theround of rebirth and disengagement arise, and your preoccupations diminish.Second, the benefits of meditation on death are abandonment of faulty behaviorand the gathering of qualities within yourself. You become freed from delusion,such as attachment to things as permanent, and from desire and anger. Youdevelop utmost diligence in the ennobling activity that brings your stores ofgoodness and wisdom to rapid completion. All the victors think of you: you diein happiness and quickly attain enlightenment.This concludes the commentary to the words of “Reflection on Death andImpermanence,” Book 4 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses andTantras, a work that elucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 5: THE WORKINGS OF KARMABook 5, “The Workings of Karma,” has four chapters: “A Brief Presentation of theNature of Action, Karma, and Consequences”; “The Extensive Explanation ofCorrupting Acts and Their Consequences”; “The Explanation of Ennobling ActsConsistent with Goodness and Their Consequences”; and “A Concise Presentation ofActs Consistent with Freedom and Their Consequences.”Chapter 1: Since death is certain, correct conduct in relation to ennobling actsor wrongdoing is crucial. On the foundation of the storehouse of all dualisticexperience, acts engendered by ignorance and its associated factors, theafflicted mind’s three poisons, produce the ten corrupting acts. These result inrebirth within the three miserable existences. The ten ennobling acts lead torebirth as gods and humans; uncontaminated ennobling acts lead to the attainmentof freedom.Chapter 2 has five parts. First, the ten corrupting acts are as follows: First,killing can be defined as the unmistaken, deliberate ending of another’s life;and similarly, striking, beating, or any other act which harms another’sphysical well-being. Taking what is not given can be defined as stealinganother’s wealth or possessions; and similarly, gain through any deceitful ordishonest means. Wrongful desire can be defined as sexual intercourse with apartner claimed by another; and similarly, engaging in inappropriate sexualactivity. Lying can be defined as confounding truth and lies in order todeceive; and similarly, to manipulate others with seeming honesty. Divisivespeech can be defined as words that estrange persons in harmony or those alreadyunfriendly toward one another; and similarly, to foster animosity by speaking ofanother’s faults. Meaningless speech can be defined as talk of unsound treatisesor any form of gossip; and similarly, talk of various irrelevant ormaterialistic topics. Rough speech can be defined as use of words that hurtanother’s feelings; and similarly, to talk of things that cause othersdiscomfort. Covetousness can be defined as the wish to acquire another’s socialstanding or possessions; and similarly, to be attached through desire toanother’s wealth. Ill will can be defined as the mental agitation of maliciousthoughts toward another; and similarly, to not wish for another’s good fortune.Wrong views can be defined as belief in eternalism or nihilism, or lack ofbelief in action and consequences; and similarly, to exaggerate or to denigratecorrect spiritual teaching.Second, corrupting acts produce four results: the completely ripened result,experience consistent with karma, acts consistent with karma, and environmentalconsequences.The completely ripened result of corrupting acts functions as follows: minoracts among the ten corrupting acts result in rebirth as an animal; medium acts,as a starving spirit; and serious acts, as a hell being.Third, experience consistent with corrupting karma functions in the followingmanner: even if you attain birth in the higher existences, taking life resultsin a short life span and in many sicknesses that prove incurable. Taking whatwas not given results in poverty and in encountering many enemies and thieves.Wrongful desire and sexual conduct result in an unattractive spouse and inencountering many competitive enemies. Lying results in often becoming theobject of criticism and deceit. Divisive speech results in separation fromfriends and family and in general disharmony. Rough speech results in hearingmany unpleasant things and in your own speech becoming the source of arguments.Meaningless speech results in lack of self-confidence and in your words notbeing believed. Covetousness results in not accomplishing what you had hoped andin lack of contentment. Ill will results in fearfulness and in often beingharmed. Wrong views result in continued belief in mistaken views and in beinggreatly deceived.In this way, each of the ten corrupting acts has two categories ofresults—completely ripened result and experience consistent with karma.Fourth, acts consistent with corrupting karma incline you to be prone tocontinue to do now whatever of the ten corrupting acts you did in past lives andthus, naturally and effortlessly, to commit many negative deeds and to fall onceagain into the miserable existences.Fifth, the environmental result ripens in the place of birth: Taking another’slife results in birth in an unattractive region where medicinal plants do notgrow, where the food and drink are hard to digest and not nutritious, and whereany sickness can be life-threatening. Taking what was not given results in birthin a region where harvests do not ripen, where frost and hail are common, andwhere famines occur. Wrongful sexual conduct results in birth in a swampy area,in a region that is unhygienic and malodorous due to feces and urine, and in afrightening and depressing place. Lying results in birth in a land where thepeople live in disharmony and with changing fortunes, and in a region of fearfuldeceit. Divisive speech results in birth in a region of ravines, steep cliffs,and deep gorges, where travel is difficult and the land very uneven, and whereeither moving or settling down are inconvenient. Rough speech results in birthin a dusty, filthy land of bad crops where rocks, stunted tree trunks, thorns,salty ground, and other things proliferate, making the land disturbing andunpleasant. Meaningless speech results in birth in an unstable land where theseasons are unpredictable and where harvests do not ripen. Covetousness resultsin birth in a land where fruit is sparse but bark plentiful, and where the placeand time are evil. Ill will results in birth in a land where harm abounds:bandits, thieves, snakes, poison, the ruler’s punishments, wild maliciousanimals, and hot-tasting fruit. Wrong views result in birth in a land withoutmines of jewels or other natural resources, where flowers, fruit, and medicinaltrees are rare, and where there is no security or powerful friends to providesanctuary.Chapter 3 has five parts. First, the path of positive, ennobling acts has tenaspects: Having renounced taking life, you ransom the lives of those sure todie. Not taking what was not given, you give gifts of material goods. Notengaging in wrongful sexual activity, you act purely. Not lying, you speakhonestly. Not speaking divisively, you seek to reconcile differences betweenothers. Not speaking nonsense, you talk about meaningful subjects. Not speakingroughly, you speak pleasantly. Not coveting, you are contented. Untroubled byill will, you develop an altruistic attitude. Having abandoned wrong views, youdedicate yourself to correct views.Acts of stillness are meditations that lead to rebirth in the four levels ofmeditative stability and in the four formless realms.Second, the consequences of ripened ennobling acts are as follows: ennoblingacts tainted by jealousy and associated factors result in birth in the regionsof demigods. A minor number of the ten ennobling acts tainted by pride resultsin birth as a human being; a middle number, as a god of the desire realm; amajor number in conjunction with the four levels of meditative stability, inbirth as a god in the form realm. If the ten ennobling acts are performed inconjunction with the four levels of formless meditative stability, they resultin rebirth as a god in the formless realm.In the desire realm, karma principally manifests in the seven collections ofcoarse consciousness; in the form realm, within the storehouse consciousness, inclarity without discursive thought; and in the formless realm, in tranquilitythat remains one-pointed, within the storehouse of all dualistic experience.Third, ennobling acts produce experience consistent with their karma:Renunciation of killing results in long life, freedom from illness, andhappiness. Renunciation of taking what was not given results in attainment ofmagnificent power and wealth. Renunciation of wrongful sexual conduct results inan attractive partner and no competitive enemies. Renunciation of telling liesresults in gaining others’ praise and respect. Renunciation of divisive speechresults in being attractive in others’ sight. Renunciation of meaningless speechresults in your words being credited as trustworthy. Renunciation of roughspeech results in the increase of your favorable renown. Renunciation ofcovetousness results in accomplishment of all your goals. Renunciation of illwill results in being attractive and subduing others on sight. Renunciation ofwrong views results in correct views arising in your mind.Fourth, the result of having put the ten ennobling acts into practice duringprevious lifetimes is to turn away from corrupting acts in thought, word, anddeed and natural application to the ten ennobling acts. This leads to theattainment of excellent lifetimes among gods and humans.Fifth, the environmental result of the ten ennobling acts’ conduct is describedas follows: Renunciation of taking life results in birth in a pleasant landwhere medicine and grains are nutritious and where life is secure. Renunciationof taking what was not given results in birth in a land where harvests areabundant and wealth in food and riches increases. Renunciation of wrongfulsexual conduct results in birth in an attractive land which is clean, wide, andsweet-smelling. Renunciation of lies results in birth in a land where wealthlasts, which lives in harmony with its neighbors, and where there is no deceitor insecurity. Renunciation of divisive speech results in birth in a land whichis spacious, happy, and even; where both travel and settling down are easy.Renunciation of meaningless speech results in birth in a land where the seasonsare regular, and where leaves, flowers, and fruit ripen on time. Renunciation ofabusive speech results in birth in a land where the fields are even, and whichis adorned with lakes and pools. Renunciation of covetousness results in birthin a land where plentiful harvests of every desirable object grow. Renunciationof ill will results in birth in a land where all inhabitants—humans andnonhumans—are not harmful and which has every favorable condition. Renunciationof wrong views results in birth in a magnificent land which has jewel mines,security, and powerful allies.Chapter 4 has two parts. First, to gain freedom from the sufferings ofexistence, you enter the ways of the hearers, solitary sages, or bodhisattvas,then strive day and night at ennobling acts, epitomized by the thirty-sevenfacets of awakening, the four immeasurable aspirations, and the six transcendentperfections. Fully positive acts of body, speech, and mind such as these, sealedwith dedication to enlightenment, are called “acts consistent with freedom.”Second, physical, verbal, and mental ennobling acts guided by the skillful meansand sublime insight of the three Buddhist ways constitute acts that result inthe temporary attainment of life as a god or human being and in the ultimateattainment of the hearers’ or solitary sages’ awakening or of supreme awakening.This concludes a commentary to the words of “The Workings of Karma,” Book 5 ofThe Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work thatelucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 6: THE FLAWS OF THE ROUND OF REBIRTHBook 6, “The Flaws of the Round of Rebirth,” has six chapters, describing thesuffering from heat and cold in the hells; the suffering from hunger and thirstamong starving spirits; the suffering of beasts of burden in the animal realm;the suffering from birth, aging, sickness, and death in the human realm; thesuffering from conflict in the demigods’ realm; and the suffering from death andfalling in the realm of the gods.Chapter 1 has four parts. The first section has nine parts. First, since asdescribed, the relation between actions and their results functions preciselyand subtly, many negative acts motivated by the force of anger result in theexcruciating suffering of the hells.Those reborn in the first hell, Reviving, take miraculous birth on a ground ofhot iron. On seeing one another, the hell beings burn with uncontrollable rageand strike one another with sharp weapons. Once dead, the beings are revived bya voice from the sky, which says, “Come to life again!” and they reexperiencethe same torment of suffering. Their duration of life is calculated as follows:fifty human years equal a day for the gods of the four great divine kings(thirty such days equal one month; twelve months, one year); five hundred ofsuch years equal one day in Reviving Hell. Beings in this hell live five hundredof their own years: they suffer for a total of one trillion, six hundred andtwenty billion human years.Second, below, in Black Line Hell, beings are sliced up by saws, then rejoined,again cut and rejoined: their sufferings are immeasurable. Their duration oflife is calculated as follows: one hundred human years equal one day for thegods of Heaven of the Thirty-Three; one thousand of their years equal one day inBlack Line Hell; beings in this hell live one thousand of their own years. Inhuman years, this equals three trillion, two hundred and forty billion years ofenduring suffering from being cut and sliced up.Third, below, in Crushing Hell, mountains are shaped like the heads of suchanimals as tigers, lions, horses, camels, and sheep. Beings suffer from beingpulverized to dust between these; the mountains then separate and they return tolife. Further, in a region of iron, iron hammers beat them to powder; they arepressed so their blood flows in great streams. Their duration of life iscalculated as follows: two hundred human years equal one day in the Heaven ofTwins; two thousand years there equal one day in Crushing Hell; beings in thishell live for two thousand of their own years, equal in human years to sixtrillion, four hundred and eighty billion years of torment due to unbearablekarma.Fourth, below, in Wailing Hell, beings are burned by great blazing fires andcooked in molten iron: they cry out in agony. Their duration of life iscalculated as follows: four hundred human years equal one day in Joyful Heaven;four thousand years there equal one day in Wailing Hell; beings in this helllive four thousand of their own years, equal in human years to twelve trillion,nine hundred and sixty billion years.Fifth, below, in Great Screaming Hell, in iron buildings, beings are burnt inblazing fires: great screaming resounds. Their duration of life is calculated asfollows: eight hundred human years equal one day in Heaven of Joy in Creation;eight thousand years there equal one day in Great Screaming; beings in this helllive eight thousand of their own years, equal in human years to twenty-fivetrillion, nine hundred and twenty billion years.Sixth, below, in Hot Hell, beings enter blazing iron buildings where they arebeaten by iron hammers and pierced by spears. Their duration of life iscalculated as follows: sixteen hundred human years equal one day in Heaven ofControl of Others’ Creations; sixteen thousand years there equal one day in HotHell; beings in this hell live sixteen thousand of their own years, equal inhuman years to fifty-one trillion, eight hundred and forty billion years of theexperience of suffering.Seventh, below, in Extremely Hot Hell, in two-storied iron buildings, beings arepierced by a three-pronged spear that protrudes from the head and the twoshoulders, then placed on a flat slab of blazing iron and cooked in moltencopper. Their suffering is immeasurable. Life there lasts half an eon, a periodincalculable in terms of human years.Eighth, below that hell, in the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment, in blazing ironbuildings, no difference can be perceived between the sentient beings and fire,apart from the hell beings’ anguished cries: they are consumed like the blazingwick of a lamp. Life there lasts for an intermediate eon. Since no greatersuffering exists, this hell is known as Torment Without Respite or Interruption.Ninth, the difference in the heat of the hells’ fires is explained as follows:in descending order from Reviving Hell, each hell’s fire is seven times moreintense than the one above.Second, the eight cold hells are located in layers directly above the eight hothells, in a dark expanse where snowstorms rage within an extremely cold, icyenclosure. In descending order, the hells’ names are Blistering, BlisterBursting, Teeth Chattering, Sneezing Achoo, Sneezing Kerchoo, Splitting like aWater Lily, Splitting like a Lotus, and Splitting like a Large Lotus. Inside thehell beings’ open wounds live various sharp-toothed insects that gnaw into theirflesh. Their duration of life is calculated as follows: If one hundred bags ofsesame seeds are emptied at the rate of one grain each hundred years, thisequals the life of a being in Blistering. The length of life in each hell belowis double that of the preceding one.Third, the neighboring hells are located around the eight hot hells or aroundHell of Uninterrupted Torment. Four lie in each of the four directions, sixteenin all: Fire Pit, Swamp of Corpses, Plain of Weapons, and River Without Ford. InFire Pit, beings see a good trench but when they enter it, it becomes a pit ofcoals where they experience the suffering of their flesh and bones being burned.In Swamp of Corpses, they see a cool swamp but when they enter it, it becomes aswamp of corpses where stinking worms with sharp iron and copper beaks eat them.In Plain of Weapons, they see a pleasant plain but when they go there, manyextremely sharp razors slice them to pieces. When they go to an attractiveforest, it becomes a forest of swords—the wind moves the swords, which fall,cutting them. They see their previous homeland at the top of a mountain, but asthey go toward it sharp iron spikes cut them so they bleed. At the top, vulturespluck out their brains, eyes, and fat. Then they think they hear a summons fromthe bottom of the hill but during their descent, the spikes turn upward and theyare again tormented by being pierced. At the bottom, they are embraced bysharp-toothed men or women, burned, and then eaten by dogs and wolves. In RiverWithout Ford, they see a river, but upon entering it, they sink up to theirnecks in hot ash, burning their flesh and bones. On the banks they see fearsomedemons who prevent them from leaving. In these hells, suffering is experiencedfor many thousands of years.Fourth, occasional hells are located in various places—on mountains, in forests,between rocks, in fire or water, or at the edge of the continents. Beings can befew, many, or alone, and so on. Each is oppressed by suffering appropriate totheir karma.Chapter 2 has two parts. A moderate number of evil acts motivated by desire andgreed results in birth as a starving spirit. Starving spirits obscured inrelation to outer phenomena see any of four mistaken perceptions: those whomistakenly perceive mountains see a cool forest, but on going there, the forestburns and falling pieces of wood scorch them. Those who mistakenly perceiverivers see a stream, but on going there, the wind blows hot sand: the placebecomes a plain of agony. Those who mistakenly perceive rain clouds see a cloudfrom which a rain of iron arrows falls like bolts of lightning with fire-arrowsand smoke, cutting them. Those who mistakenly perceive temperature feelsnowstorms hot when heat threatens them, and fire cold when cold threatens.Those obscured in relation to physical perceptions have a mouth the size of theeye of a needle, a belly the size of a province, and arms and legs the size ofblades of grass. When they eat a little, a fire burns inside, scorches theirinner organs, and sends smoke billowing out their mouths. Those who have generalobscurations are obsessed with food and drink but see others aggressivelyguarding the food.Second, starving spirits who fly through space include ruler demons, noxiousspirits, ogres, tsen spirits, and demons. They fly unhindered through the powerof their miraculous karma. They cause diseases, steal radiant well-being,obstruct vitality, and perform various kinds of harmful acts.The life span of starving spirits is calculated as follows: one human month is aday for the starving spirits; they live five hundred of their own years. Inhuman terms, this equals fifteen thousand years, during which they experiencesuffering according to their previous acts.Chapter 3: A small number of corrupting acts motivated by stupidity results inbirth as an animal. Submerged in the depths of oceans between the continents,dolphins, fish, crustaceans, and other such wealth of the nagas—animals ofvarious shapes and sizes—live crowded together like the fermented grains leftafter beer has been brewed. The large eat the small; the small pierce the large.At such dark places as the sides of the iron mountains at the far reaches of theworld-system, animals experience the limitless suffering of being eaten by oneanother.Species scattered among the five other realms of existence—such as birds, deer,wild animals, horses, cattle, and sheep—are made beasts of burden or areslaughtered for their meat, skin, or bones. Hot sand and fear of garudas tormentnagas.The animals who live the longest live for an eon; the shortest, for a day. Lifespan is uncertain and varied.Chapter 4 has two parts. A small number of ennobling acts motivated by pride andattachment results in birth as a human of the four continents. Humans of allfour continents, and particularly those of this world, Land of Jambu, experiencetorment by three principal and eight secondary sufferings.The three principal sufferings are suffering heaped upon suffering: for example,when assailed by enemies, to fall ill. The suffering of change: for example,after suffering from hunger and thirst, to be unable to digest food. Thesuffering of the composite: for example, to act corruptly to acquire food orclothing; or afflictive poisons that lead you to commit corrupting acts, thecauses of suffering.Second, this section has eight parts. First, in the womb, energy, mind, semen,and ovum conjoin: the fetus grows and develops for nine months and ten days,during which time it experiences the sufferings of being cramped in a dark,nauseating place. When the mother eats, the fetus feels as if crushed under amountain; when she moves, as if falling down a precipice. When karma turns thechild’s head and backsides around at birth, the child experiences suffering likethat of the Crushing Hell.Second, during the suffering of aging, the complexion fades, hair turns white,teeth fall out, eyes weaken, warmth grows faint, digestive strength isexhausted, memory fades, and you walk, sit, or move with difficulty. The tonguecannot taste distinct flavors; sounds are unheard. Faults multiply, qualitiesdiminish: everybody disdains you.Third, during the suffering of sickness, this healthy body is made seriously illby disturbances of circulating energy, bile, or phlegm. Food and drink seemrevolting, sleep is impossible, lancing pain racks your body, and intolerablystrong medicines and treatments, such as burning and blood-letting, must beborne.Fourth, when life’s creative force is spent, karma at an end, and conditionsthat nurture life dissipate, the signs of death appear and delusory perceptionsarise. You must leave behind this cherished body, possessions, family, andcompanions to wander alone along the terrifying passage between lifetimes. Youassume the new miserable body your karma impels you to take—miseries such asthese make the suffering of death interminable. How heartbreaking!Fifth, the suffering of meeting enemies includes the misery of not having themeans to prevent their harm to your body or possessions due to their numbers;their foul, harmful acts; or their time of appearing.Sixth, when separated from loved ones, you remember their qualities and wailwith many laments. Without companions or loved ones, your power is weak, yourmind hesitant. You have no opportunity for happiness; you feel great anguish.Seventh, with no food for your mouth, no clothes for your back, no place tostay, no useful wealth, you sink into the misery of poverty and destitution,when no matter how hard you try, you can’t accomplish the slightest fraction ofyour wishes.Eighth, the five contaminated psychophysical aggregates—form, sensation,perception, formative factors, and consciousness—are nothing but suffering’ssupport, vessel, and source.Chapter 5: Ennobling acts influenced by jealousy and associated factors resultin birth as a demigod of four kinds. Demigods feel overpowering jealousy towardthe wealth and splendor of the gods and suffer from such things as being woundedor killed in battle during conflicts and disputes with the gods.Chapter 6 has three parts. First, accumulating a large number of the tenennobling acts motivated by the force of pride results in birth as a god of thedesire realm. When these gods suffer death and falling, their color fades, theirseat becomes uncomfortable, their flowers wilt, their clothes reek, and theirbody perspires. Their friends leave and they sit alone and confused. Through thepower of their clairvoyance, they see the place of their future rebirth: theybecome terrified. This unbearable experience lasts for seven days of the gods.Second, when the form realm gods’ karma of mental stability is spent or when theformless gods’ karma of mental tranquility is exhausted, they fall from level tolevel, experiencing endless descent into the suffering of conditioned existence.Therefore, attainment of higher existences is but a fleeting respite fromsuffering without any lasting value.Third, since suffering exists wherever you are born within the round of rebirth,you must exert yourself to achieve freedom by any means possible. The means ofspiritual guidance taught by innumerable victors who appeared in the past arenot sufficient in themselves: think, “I will strive above all else at thesupreme means to reach freedom and accomplish my aspirations for lastingwell-being.”This concludes the commentary to the words of “The Flaws of the Round ofRebirth,” Book 6 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras,a work that elucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 7: TAKING REFUGE AND THE LESSER WAYBook 7, “Taking Refuge and the Lesser Way,” has four chapters: “How to TakeRefuge, the Foundation for All Vows”; “How to Keep the Seven Kinds of IndividualLiberation Vows”; “An Explanation of the Foundation, Paths, and Results of theHearers’ Way”; and “An Explanation of the Foundation, Paths, and Results of theSolitary Sages’ Way.”Chapter 1 has eight parts. First, refuge is taken in fear of suffering in theround of rebirth as described, and with the wish for freedom. Lesser individualstake refuge in fear of the sufferings within the miserable existences and togain the higher existences of gods and humans. The two kinds of middleindividual take refuge in fear of suffering within the round of rebirth. Greatindividuals take refuge to liberate all beings and in fear of both existence andthe bliss of static peace. These three individuals’ attitudes are distinguishedby the significant differences in their attitudes—inferior, middle, and best.Second, the duration of refuge: Lesser individuals take refuge until theyachieve positive results later. Middle individuals take refuge eithertemporarily—as long as they live—or ultimately—until they achieve the results ofthe ways of hearers or solitary sages, the state of arhat. Great individualstake refuge until they reach unsurpassable awakening.Third, the places of refuge are as follows. The body of ultimate enlightenmentis endowed with five kinds of vision, six forms of clairvoyance, ten powers,aspects of retention, ten forces, four forms of fearlessness, four modes ofindividual awareness, and eighteen unique qualities. Enlightenment’s two formbodies—the body of perfect rapture and the sublime manifest body—display thethirty-two excellent signs and the eighty marks of physical perfection, and allsixty aspects of melodious speech. They epitomize wisdom, love, and capability.The doctrine of scriptural transmission comprises discourses, aphorisms inverse, prophetic declarations, verses, meaningful expressions, narratives,parables, legends, extensive teachings, tales of past lives, establishedinstructions, and marvelous events. The fourth collection contains thetantras—action, conduct, yoga, highest yoga, father, mother, and nondual. Thedoctrine of realization comprises special realizations born in your stream ofbeing from experiential cultivation on the paths of the discourses’ and tantras’ways.The spiritual community comprises in the lesser way hearers and solitary sagesin eight groups (four pairs of enterers and abiders—stream-enterers, returners,nonreturners, and arhats); and in the great way, the victors’ heirs who havereached stages of awakening, and hosts of dakinis, adepts, and awarenessholders.Fourth, causal refuge is taken in the following manner: In the vivid presence ofthe places of refuge, imagined to be gathered in space before you, all beingsrespectfully fold hands in prayer with you and recite:To become free from every danger of the realms of existence and of static peace,I respectfully take refuge with faith in the spiritual master, the Buddha, thedoctrine, and the spiritual community, until I attain unsurpassable awakening.After repeating those lines three times, consider that you receive the refugevows. Finally, the givers of refuge, the host of wisdom deities, joyfully sendblessing in the form of a mass of light that purifies your own and every being’sphysical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing and obscurations: this completes yourcultivation of goodness and plants the fortune to attain enlightenment’s formbodies. In taking refuge in the Buddha, think of him as the teacher of yourteacher of refuge; the doctrine as the path; the spiritual community as yourcompanions in its practice.Fifth, the place of refuge which is the result is the body of ultimateenlightenment’s wisdom—the ultimate jewel, luminosity, the sublime state freefrom embellishment. Settle in evenness as you are able in the ultimate ongoingstate in which the giver of refuge and the taker of refuge are indivisible. Thiscompletes the store of wisdom and leads to the attainment of the body ofultimate enlightenment. After, in the understanding of phenomena as illusory,dedicate the goodness of this practice.Sixth, training in refuge as a cause includes the following points: do notforsake the spiritual master and the three jewels even for the sake of your lifeor country. After having taken refuge in the spiritual master, do not misleadvenerable persons, and forsake slander or unpleasant speech to holy persons.After having taken refuge in the Buddha, do not bow or make offerings to othergods, and foster respect to Buddhist images. After having taken refuge in thedoctrine, renounce harming others, and engender respect toward the slightestamount of the written word. After having taken refuge in the spiritualcommunity, do not make close friendships with non-Buddhists, and foster respecttoward even a scrap of orange cloth. During the day and night’s six sessions,remember the three jewels and take refuge.Training in refuge as a result includes training in the native state of thenature of reality, unembellished by concepts of high and low, what must be doneor not done, and so on.Seventh, the refuge vows are given up when wrong views have arisen and thetraining is violated.Eighth, the benefits of refuge are freedom from fear during future lifetimes;rapid completion of the stores of goodness and wisdom; increase of a host ofqualities; and protection by benevolent gods: refuge has limitless benefits. Itforms the supreme foundation for all qualities.Chapter 2 has eight parts. First, in the sublime doctrinal cycle of the fourtruths, the Teacher Buddha emphasized training in ethical conduct. In Varanasi,he taught this to the five excellent individuals. Upali compiled theseteachings. Five hundred arhats composed The Treasury of Detailed Explanation.Gunaprabha wrote and spread The Root Discourse on the Monastic Code of Conduct;Shakyaprabha, The Three-Hundred-Verse Commentary on the Training of Novices, andother texts.In Tibet, the great Indian preceptor Shantarakshita spread the lineage of thesubstantialist order’s vows. The original translations include four texts on thetransmission of discipline: The Basic Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct,The Detailed Scripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct, The SupplementaryScripture on the Monastic Code of Conduct, and The Highest Scripture on theMonastic Code of Conduct. These books contain a total of 104,800 stanzas. Apartfrom these, the Tibetan canon contains translations of seventy-two discoursesfrom the first doctrinal cycle and sixty-three treatises of commentary thatbelong to that cycle.Second, the essence of the vows is abjuration, based on an attitude ofdisengagement, of acts that harm others and the basis of such acts. Since thevows arise based upon the body and voice, they are considered to have form. Theseed of a continual attitude of renunciation is crucial.Third, the classification of the vows includes three vows for laypersons: vowsfor temporary fasting, and vows for male and female laypersons; and five kindsof vows for renunciants: vows for male novice monk and female novice nun, femalespiritual apprentice, and fully ordained monk and fully ordained nun. Together,these constitute the eight kinds of individual liberation vows. If these areclassified according to content, four kinds of vows are counted: vows oftemporary fasting, layperson, novice, and full ordination.Fourth, the vows are taken in two ways—by ancient or by modern rituals. First,rituals of former times included the following: natural full ordination, as inthe cases of the Buddha and solitary sages; ordination through understandingwisdom, as in the cases of the five excellent individuals; ordination throughacceptance of the Buddha’s command, “Come forward!” as in the case ofShariputra; ordination through promises, such as Mahakashyapa’s acceptance ofthe Buddha as his teacher, Bhadranivaha’s promise to take refuge in the threejewels, and Prajapati Gautami and others’ promise to renounce the eight seriousacts; ordination through replies to questions, such as Sudavanu’s replies thatpleased the Buddha, so that he received full ordination; and ordination based ona ritual in messages, such as in the case of Adhavari.Second, in modern rituals, an individual must be free of the five certainhindrances concerning place, time, circumstance, sentient being, and secondaryvows; and have none of the four obstacles concerning birth, residence, specialconditions, and lack of beauty.Such an individual receives the ordination gradually, in three stages—layperson,novice, and full ordination. In the former two stages of ordination, the ritualincludes three recitations—recitation of refuge, recitation of personalaffirmation, and recitation of others’ acceptance. The vows arise after therecitation of personal affirmation. In the latter stage of the ritual for fullordination, of the three recitations during that stage of the ritual—the essencerecitation, the action recitation, and the performance recitation—the vows ariseimmediately after completion of the action recitation.Fifth, this section has two parts. The first has two parts. First, temporaryfasting vows have eight aspects: the four main vows—those aspects concerned withethical conduct: renunciation of killing, renunciation of stealing, renunciationof impure conduct, and renunciation of telling lies; an aspect ofconscientiousness—renunciation of intoxicants; and three aspects ofdiscipline—renunciation of seats that are large or high; renunciation of dancingand other such acts, and wearing garlands and other ornaments; and renunciationof eating after the noon meal. There are thus three aspects of four, one, andthree—eight aspects in all.Second, a layperson who has taken vows of sustained discipline and maintains thethree refuges renounces three things: prostrations or offerings to other gods,harm to sentient beings, and close friendships with non-Buddhists. They practicethree things: respect toward as much as a fragment of a sacred support of thebody of enlightenment, a letter from a torn text, or a scrap of orange cloth.The vows are the four principal ones—not to kill living beings, not to stealanother’s wealth, not to engage in impure conduct, and not to lie—and thesupplementary vow—not to take intoxicants: together these constitute the fivevows. Among these vows, an individual can renounce one, two, three, or fiveacts. These respectively are equivalent to a layperson who maintains “one part”of the conduct, “partial,” “most,” and “complete” conduct. To renounce allimpure (that is, sexual) activity constitutes the “pure-living layperson’s”vows. To keep the eight vows (mentioned above as temporary fasting vows as asustained discipline) constitutes the “venerable layperson’s” vows.Second, this section has three parts. First, the novice vows include the fourprincipal vows—renunciation of taking human life, taking what has not beengiven, impure conduct, and lying concerning spiritual attainment. There are sixother vows: renunciation of taking intoxicants (the aspect ofconscientiousness), dancing and related acts, wearing garlands and relatedattire, resting on a large or high bed, eating after the noon meal, andaccepting gold and silver (these latter five are aspects of discipline). Whenadded to the first four, these comprise the ten coarse vows.There are thirty fine points of training when the following are added to thevows above: three aspects of killing that pertain to taking life; twelve thatpertain to lying, such as unfounded accusation; three that pertain to dancing,and other such acts; three that pertain to garlands, and other such ornaments;and two that pertain to very high beds.Thirteen permissions concern such acts as not keeping the formal robes andbegging bowl. Three pertinent offenses must be renounced: the offense of notrelinquishing the clothes of a householder, the offense of not wearing theclothes of a renunciant, and the offense of holding the preceptor in contempt.Second, female spiritual apprentices must renounce six principal acts: to travelalone, to swim across a river, to touch an adult male, to sit together with anadult male, to match-make, and to conceal their own faults; and six relatedones: to keep gold, to shave their pubic hair, to till the soil, to eat food notformally offered and accepted, to eat stored food, and to cut grass.Third, this section has six parts. First, the code of conduct for fully ordainedmonks comprises two hundred and fifty-three regulations. They are divided intofive classes of downfalls: defeating acts, remaining downfalls, downfalls thatrequire forfeiture, downfalls that only require confession, and acts to beacknowledged individually.The first of the five classes of downfalls is the defeating acts. Among these,the basis of impure conduct is one of the three openings—the mouth, anus, orgenitals—of his own or another’s body; the intention is the monk’s wish tosatisfy desire; the act is movement of the penis within one of the openings; andthe completion is satisfaction in the experience of pleasure. At that point, thefirst defeating act of impure conduct is incurred.The basis of theft is another’s wealth; the intention is the monk’s wish toacquire it for himself; the act is to steal a valuable object; and thecompletion of the act is the thought that he obtained what he wished. At thatmoment, the second defeating act, taking what is not given, is incurred.The basis of taking human life is another human being; the intention is themonk’s wish to kill the individual the monk knows is present; the act is tobegin the act of murder; its completion is achieved when the other dies beforethe monk. This incurs the third defeating act, taking life.The basis of lying is a person who understands the meaning of the monk’s words;the intention is the monk’s wish to speak in order to change the other’sperception; the act is to claim clairvoyance or other abilities although themonk has none; the act is completed when the other understands the words of thelie. This incurs the fourth defeating act, to lie concerning spiritualattainment.Second, the thirteen additional downfalls are as follows: to ejaculate, to toucha female out of desire, to speak lustful words, to extol sexual service, tomatch-make, to construct an oversized house, to construct a large house for hisown use, baseless accusation of a defeating act, slightly substantiatedaccusation of a defeating act, to create a division within the monasticcommunity, to side with those who split the monastic community, to createdisappointment among laypersons, and to voice discontent with the commands givenby the monastic assembly to encourage reparation of vows.Third, the thirty downfalls for which the object that caused the downfall mustbe forfeited concern the robes, the mat, and the begging bowl—ten for each, atotal of thirty. The first ten, concerning the robes, are (1) to keep more cloththan the monk’s own clothing for more than ten days; (2) to go for more than aday without the three robes; (3) to store material for clothing for one month;(4) to request laundry service from a fully ordained nun; (5) to accept materialfor clothing from a fully ordained nun; (6) when a monk already has the robes,to beg clothing from a householder who is not his relative; (7) when a monk doesnot have the robes, to beg more than the measure needed for the upper and lowerrobes; (8) to take what was intended to be offered but was not yet actuallygiven; (9) upon hearing that male and female householders will separately offera lot of cloth, not to investigate but to take it on the basis of having heard;and (10) to accept money in exchange for the cost of the clothing.The second ten, concerning the mat, are (1) to make a mat from expensivematerial, such as silk; (2) where such material is rare, to make a mat entirelyof black wool; (3) to make a mat more than two parts black wool; (4) to make asecond mat within six years of the first; (5) when making a new mat, to notinclude a half-cubit piece from the old one; (6) to travel farther than anearshot while carrying wool; (7) to request a fully ordained nun, who is not hisrelative, to wash wool; (8) to touch precious objects with desire; (9) to usevaluable objects, such as jewels, to make loans for profit and to have therebyacquired and accepted a cubit’s length or more of cloth; and (10) to make aprofit from buying such things as grain and material in times of plenty andselling them in times of want.The third ten, concerning the begging bowl and other possessions, are (1) tokeep longer than ten days a begging bowl that has not been consecrated; (2) tosearch for another begging bowl, even though the monk already owns one; (3) tohave a weaver who is not his relative weave cloth without remuneration; (4) toask for a better quality of weave for clothes that have already been offered andwoven for the monk by a householder who is not his relative; (5) to take backwith his own hand the cloth, or other material, he gave another monk; (6) threedownfalls concern early or late distribution of offerings—during the summerretreat, to appropriate the offerings as his own; to distribute offerings madeto the monastic community in the course of the summer retreat; or to notdistribute them the day after the retreat ends; (7) in isolation in a dangerousplace, it is permitted for a monk to be without the consecrated robes for up tosix days, but a fault is incurred at the seventh day; (8) regardless of whethera monk has promised to enter the early or later summer retreat, to have soughtand acquired the large cotton summer cloth one month before the retreat is toincur the early-searching downfall that requires forfeiture, or to keep it onehalf month after the lifting of the restrictions at the end of the retreat is toincur the late-keeping downfall that requires forfeiture; (9) to appropriate ashis own any object that has been given by a householder either to the monasticcommunity or to another fully ordained monk; and (10) to store any of the fourmedicines beyond the appropriate time.Fourth, the ninety downfalls are divided into nine categories of ten each. Thisis the first set of ten, the conscious downfalls: (1) to consciously tell a lie;(2) to speak of a fully ordained monk’s faults; (3) to cause dissension amongfriendly fully ordained monks; (4) to recreate division among fully ordainedmonks who had settled their differences; (5) unaccompanied by a fellow monk, togive spiritual teaching to a woman; (6) to recite scriptures in a variety ofmelodies with someone who is not fully ordained; (7) to speak of downfalls ofdefeating acts and additional defeating acts to someone who is not a fullyordained monk;

(7) to make anoversized mat for the summer retreat; (8) to make an oversized rash cover forthe summer retreat; (9) to make an oversized great-cloth for the summer retreat;(10) to make one’s robes the size of the Teacher’s robes.Fifth, the four acts to be acknowledged individually are these: to beg for foodfrom a fully ordained nun in a village or elsewhere; to eat food that has beenserved without regard to rank by a fully ordained nun to three or four membersof the monastic community; to eat food begged from a household declaredrestricted from begging due to special circumstances; and, although designatedto watch the forest, to not be careful in watching but to beg food and eat atthe appropriate time.Sixth, among the one hundred and twelve reprehensible acts, ten concern wearingclothes, of which seven concern the lower robe: It is a reprehensible act towear the lower robe (1) not evenly round, (2) only reaching the knees in length,(3) touching the ankles in length, (4) with a long overhanging piece of materialin front, (5) with the belt tied upward, (6) with the belt sticking out in themiddle, (7) the upper part uneven.

reprehensible act to climb a tree to a heighthigher than that of a man, except in the case of danger.Thus, in total, there are two hundred and fifty-three vows for a fully ordainedmonk.In brief, a fully ordained nun renounces eight defeating acts, twenty remainingdownfalls, thirty-three downfalls that require forfeiture, one hundred andeighty simple downfalls, eleven acts to be acknowledged individually, and onehundred and twelve reprehensible acts—three hundred and sixty-four regulationsin all.Sixth, the life that is the support for the vows is a male or female human beingfrom one of three continents—the southern, eastern, or western. Non-Buddhists,those who have committed one of the acts of immediate fruition, neuters (personswith no genitals), hermaphrodites (who have genitals of both genders), andpersons from the continent of Unpleasant Sound are ineligible to receive thevows.Seventh, the vows are terminated by offering back the training, by death, bychange of gender, by the arising of wrong views, by the commission of one of theprincipal downfalls, by the decline of the Buddhist doctrine, or by otherevents.Eighth, if a defeating act has been committed, that fact must not be concealed.The training must be offered back with regret: it is said the vows can therebyarise again. If a defeating act is concealed, the vows cannot be repaired duringthis lifetime. In the cases of remaining downfalls, downfalls that requirerelinquishment and other infractions must be regretted that is, admitted in thepresence of the monastic community. By energetic application to restoring thevows, they can be purified.Chapter 3 has two parts. First, on the pure foundation of the vows of individualliberation, taken so that the holder reaches freedom from existence, the hearerspractice the four guidelines of ennobling training: to not return anger withanger, to not return verbal abuse with verbal abuse, to not return blows withblows, and to not return criticism with criticism.Second, the view is the realization of the nonexistence of the self sensed inthe individual. Along the lesser path of cultivation, meditation is on the fourforms of mindfulness, such as meditation on the nine perceptions of the body’simpurities; at the middle level of that path, on the four genuine renunciations;and at the highest level, on the four supports for miraculous power. At the heatand peak levels of the path of application, meditation is on the five powers; atthe levels of forbearance and sublime qualities, on the five forces. At the pathof seeing, meditation is on the seven aspects of awakening; at the lesser,middle and highest levels of the path of meditation, on the branches of theeightfold exalted path. Thus, the thirty-seven facets of awakening areactualized by these stages of meditation.The conduct is to keep the two hundred and fifty-three regulations of fullmonastic ordination during ten thousand great eons. Having trained in the vows,the result on the path beyond training is the attainment of the state of arhat,after which the psychophysical aggregations dissolve without remainder into therealm of peace. The arhat rests within that state for ten thousand great eons.Chapter 4: The foundation of the way of solitary sages is correctself-restraint, motivated by disengagement. The view is the nonexistence of theindividual sense of self, but without renunciation of the clinging consciousnessthat grasps objective phenomena.The rhinoceros-like solitary sage traverses the path during the course of onehundred great eons; a solitary sage of a large community, during one hundredlifetimes; and a solitary sage of a small community, in just thirteen humanlifetimes.On the four paths of training—cultivation, application, seeing, andmeditation—meditation is done on the thirty-seven facets of awakening; on thethree gateways to liberation—emptiness, absence of characteristics, andaspirationlessness; and on the unfolding in sequence and the reversal of thetwelve links of causation: (1) ignorance, not knowing the nature of reality; (2)formations, from having fallen into the round of rebirth; (3) consciousness,developed from the storehouse consciousness; (4) name and form, the fivepsychophysical aggregations; (5) the six senses—the five sense organs and themental faculty; (6) contact—the gathering of object, sense, and mind; (7)sensation—of pleasure, pain, and neutral; (8) craving—the centering around aself of the rejection or acceptance of sensations; (9) grasping—yearning for theobjects of desire; (10) existence—entering the womb; (11) birth—exit from thewomb; (12) aging and death—as youth fades, aging and death.The conduct is to sustain the sublime ethical conduct of serenity andself-control. The result on the path of no further training is the state of asolitary sage arhat, which is the actualization of a middle state of awakening.They rest in the sphere of static peace for a period as long as they previouslyspent cultivating goodness and wisdom. Then, drawn by the light of the victors,they are reborn in a lotus in a pure land of the manifest body of enlightenment.After seven years there, the lotus opens, they see the Buddha’s face, and learnthe path of the great way. Through meditation, they attain enlightenment in thecourse of that very lifetime.This concludes the commentary to the words of “Taking Refuge and the LesserWay,” Book 7 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, awork that elucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 8: THE FOUNDATION OF THE MIDDLE WAYBook 8, “The Foundation of the Middle Way,” has three chapters: “How the BuddhaTaught the Doctrine’s Final Cycle and an Explanation of Ultimate and RelativeTruths”; “The Doctrine’s Middle Cycle, the Buddha’s Past Lives, and MentalTraining Through the Four Immeasurable Aspirations”; and “The Main Explanationof the Uplift of the Mind to Awakening.”Chapter 1 has three parts. First, on the foundation established by the vows ofrefuge as described, the meaning of our enlightened heritage, innate constituentenlightenment, buddha nature, can be explained within the context of the greatway’s uplift of the mind to sublime awakening.In lands of gods, nagas, and other beings, Honored Shakyamuni taught a varietyof disciples the doctrine of his final cycle of instructions, definitiveultimate truth. The original translations include Flower Ornament Discourse;Mound of Jewels Discourse; The Transcendence of Sorrow Discourse; The DiscourseRequested by the King, the Powerful Formula; The Lion’s Roar of Shrimaladevi;The Discourse Requested by the Girl Named Ratnadevi; The Discourse Requested bythe Goddess Vimalaprabha; The Discourse to Help Angulimala; The DiscourseRequested by Maitreya; The Discourse on Buddha Nature—ninety large units in all.The new translations include twenty-four discourses and forty treatises ofcommentary.Second, this section has four parts: First, from the perspective of ultimatetruth, the qualities of buddha nature’s appearance aspect manifest asenlightenment’s bodies and pure lands; its emptiness aspect’s qualities includethe ten forces and four forms of fearlessness. These qualities are primordial,not created by causes or conditions, and their nature is ever present and neverchanging. The innate constituent enlightenment of indwelling awareness is veiledby incidental stains—the delusion of dualistic clinging, karma, and mentalafflictions. When these veils are cleansed by refinement on the spiritual pathof techniques, stainless qualities all blossom.Within the basic space of phenomena, the phenomena of the round of rebirth arelike obscuring clouds, and the phenomena of transcendent states, light. Bothshare the same essence. The enlightened heritage’s own essence, like the circleof the sun, is free from all obscurations. From the perspective of that essence,its qualities are ever present and its having been covered by faults was neverexperienced. From the perspective of appearances, there are mental afflictionsand their subsequent purification.Second, buddha nature pervades all sentient life. The signs of this enlightenedheritage having awakened are sight of existence’s faults and of the qualities ofperfect peace. This is like planting the excellent root, very vast qualities, ofthe tree of awakening, which bears the fruit of your own and others’welfare—certain crossing of the sea of existence.Third, this section has three parts. First, the support of the enlightenedheritage is the basic space of phenomena, emptiness; its content is theappearance of wisdom—natural luminosity with the physical marks and signs ofenlightenment. When classified according to emptiness and appearance, thatoriginal pervasive luminosity can be said to be twofold: The support is theempty basic space of phenomena. This constitutes “what must be separated fromdelusion” to produce the body of ultimate enlightenment, the essential body ofenlightenment. The content is wisdom’s appearance—natural luminosity adornedwith the physical marks and signs of enlightenment. This constitutes “what mustbe separated from delusion” to produce enlightenment’s two bodies that haveform.To define the terminology used here, the “basis of separation” is our innateconstituent enlightenment or buddha nature. That which removes impurities onthat basis, the “cause of separation,” is ennobling acts consistent withfreedom, aspects of the spiritual path’s truth. The “result of separation” isbuddha nature entirely divested of impurities, its qualities manifest. What mustbe separated from (that is, delusion) is the eight collections of consciousnessand their propensities, based in the storehouse of all dualistic experience withits various habitual patterns.In secret mantra’s terminology, these four (the basis, cause, and result ofseparation); and what must be separated from are called the basis ofpurification, the purifier, the result of purification, and what must bepurified. Although the terms differ, their meanings are identical.At the level of enlightenment, the unfolding enlightened heritage is theappearance aspect, the body of enlightenment’s perfect rapture; the naturalenlightened heritage is its emptiness aspect, the body of ultimateenlightenment. From the perspective of the period of training on the path, thenatural, spontaneous presence of both aspects of the basic space of phenomena’senlightened heritage is termed the natural enlightened heritage. This acts as asupport upon which any cultivation of the sources of ennobling acts of bothgoodness and wisdom (from the initial uplift of the mind to awakening untilculmination at the tenth stage of awakening) is termed the fully cultivated orunfolding enlightened heritage.Second, sentient beings’ enlightened heritage exists within impurity;bodhisattvas’ enlightened heritage, in purity; and the transcendent ones’enlightened heritage or innate constituent enlightenment, in extreme purity. Forexample, containers made from such differing substances as clay, wood, or jewelseach appear to have greater or lesser value, but the space they hold has nodistinguishing value.Third, this section has three parts. First, the butter contained in milk isinvisible; likewise, the basic space of phenomena mixed within mentalafflictions rests unseen. The refinement of milk produces butter; likewise, oncethe mental afflictions are refined, the basic space of phenomena becomes clearlyapparent.A lamp placed in a vase is totally invisible; likewise, the basic space ofphenomena rests unseen within the vase of the mental afflictions. Light willflow from wherever a hole is made in the vase; likewise, when the vajra ofmeditative states shatters the vase of mental afflictions, the basic space ofphenomena appears.The radiance of a precious jewel does not shine when covered by stones;likewise, when veiled by mental afflictions, the basic space of phenomena doesnot radiate, but in transcendent states, it does.When covered by the earth of mental afflictions, gold, the enlightened heritageor innate constituent enlightenment, can appear clearly only when the earth isremoved. Likewise, purification on the path makes enlightenment manifest.The peel covers a fruit; mental afflictions conceal enlightenment. Like a fruitfreed from its peel, the body of ultimate enlightenment freed from the mentalafflictions is perfectly evident.Like the first taste of the plantain’s fruit, the baseless round of rebirthproduces the result of enlightenment.These six metaphors illustrate the three periods of the spiritual path’s basis,path, and result.The buddha nature that lies within the confines of an ordinary individual’sdesire can be likened to a buddha hidden in a lotus bud. The enlightenedheritage or innate constituent enlightenment that lies within the confines ofanger can be likened to bees and honey. Buddha nature within the confines ofstupidity can be likened to a fruit inside its peel. These three examplesillustrate buddha nature within the confines of the latent propensity toward thethree poisons.Buddha nature within the confines of the actual arousal of the three poisons islike gold in mud. The innate constituent enlightenment that lies within theconfines of the propensity toward ignorance of listener and solitary sage arhatsis like a treasure under the earth. The impurities renounced on the great waypath of seeing still present within the stream of being of an ordinaryindividual engaged in the training, and the impurities renounced on the path ofmeditation present within the stream of being of an exalted individual, areillustrated by the metaphors of grain covered in a husk and a jewel covered inrags. The impurities present in those who rest on the ten stages ofawakening—the impurities of those who rest on the seven impure stages and ofthose who rest on the three pure stages—are illustrated by the two metaphors ofa ruler concealed in the womb and gold covered with earth.These are the nine metaphors and their meanings.Second, we distinguish names for the enlightened heritage as follows. It iscalled the basic space of phenomena, since its realization is the basis fortranscendent states, whereas when it is not realized, the round of rebirtharises. It is called natural, ever present enlightenment, since it is a naturalattribute in beings, primordial and noncomposite. It is called buddha nature,since all qualities of enlightenment are present within it. It is called innateconstituent enlightenment or ultimate ground, from the perspective of obscuringimpurities. It is called ultimate truth, since it is the abiding nature. It iscalled luminous wisdom, since it is originally pure. It is called profoundemptiness, the nature of the middle way, since it transcends extremes ofexistence and nonexistence based in exaggeration or deprecation. It is calledperfection of sublime insight, since it is free from all formulated extremes. Itis called inseparable truths, since it is nondual clarity and emptiness. It iscalled true nature, since its characteristics are without change or transition.Third, concerning the innate constituent enlightenment’s ultimate essence,persons on the paths of cultivation and application intellectually believe, “Itdefinitely exists,” but do not actually see it. Once they reach awakening’sfirst stage, they partially see it. At the stage of enlightenment, whateverconstitutes its nature becomes directly manifest, thus nondually seen.Since this basic space of phenomena is the ultimate truth, seeing its nature iscalled “sight of ultimate truth.” Nothingness (literally, “emptiness of nothingwhatsoever”) is not the ultimate truth. Such subjects as the lack of an existentself are taught to beginners or to ordinary, spiritually immature individuals,as remedies for their attachment to a sense of self as existent. In fact, itshould be understood that the basic space of phenomena, noncomposite luminosity,is ever present.Fourth, the enlightened heritage is empty, since it is empty of faults andcomposite formations, but is not empty as if devoid of its own positivequalities: its every quality is ever present and complete. This view correctsfive mistakes: to not be able to uplift your mind to awakening because you donot see that you have the essence of awakening; to have contempt, as if to say,“I am a bodhisattva; others are sentient beings”; to not comprehend the ultimatebasic space of phenomena; to disparage the body of ultimate enlightenment, dueto falling into extreme views of eternalism or nihilism; and to not see yourselfand sentient beings as equals.When you understand that you and all sentient beings share this innateconstituent enlightenment, you develop diligence in the joyful considerationthat the accomplishment of freedom presents no difficulty. By developingdiligence, your help to others, sublime insight, wisdom, and love infinitelyincrease: you become capable of accomplishing others’ welfare.Third, the essence of relative truth is the mental domain created by therational dualistic mind and the senses. The definition of the term relativetruth is what appears to deluded consciousness to be reliable and attachment toits apparent reality. The characteristic of relative truth is phenomena that donot surpass the rational dualistic mind’s domain and that cannot forbearexamination. Its classification has two categories: first, genuine relativetruth corresponds to the forms, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, andphenomena that appear to the six unimpaired senses; second, misleading relativetruth corresponds to disturbed appearances due to impaired senses—such as imagesof floating and melting forms.Chapter 2 has three parts. First, on Vulture Peak, Honored Powerful Sage(Shakyamuni) turned the middle cycle of spiritual instructions, that of absenceof characteristics, for a circle of disciples endowed with the great way’senlightened heritage. His teachings compiled by Gentle Melody (Manjugosha),explained by Nagarjuna and Aryadeva, and expounded by Chandrakirti andShantideva are known as the profound view tradition. His teachings compiled byLoving Kindness (Maitreya), explained by Asanga and his brother Vasubandhu,upheld by Dignaga, Dharmakirti, Chandragomi, and others, and expounded in Tibetby Lord Atisha are known as the vast activity tradition. Lotus-Born’s personaltradition concurs with the profound view tradition.In the doctrine’s middle cycle, that of the absence of characteristics, theoriginal translations in the Tibetan canon include twenty-three discourses:1. The extensive version, The Perfection of Sublime Insight in One HundredThousand Stanzas, a text that has 301 parts and 72 chapters2. The extensive middle-length version, The Perfection of Sublime Insight inTwenty-Five Thousand Stanzas3.

The Perfection of Sublime Insight for Vajrapani23. The Perfection of Sublime Insight for VajraketuIn this cycle of the doctrine, the original translations also include 197treatises: 40 treatises of commentary pertain to Maitreya’s The Ornament ofManifest Realization, which presents the hidden meaning of the transcendentperfection of sublime insight; 157 treatises of commentary pertain toNagarjuna’s The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight, which presents the directteaching of emptiness.Second, this section has three parts. First, concerning his initial uplift ofthe mind to awakening, Powerful Sage (the Buddha in a previous lifetime) firstoffered a parasol, a pair of shoes, and five hundred seashells arranged in theform of flowers to the great Buddha Shakyamuni and then in his presence upliftedhis mind to sublime awakening for the first time.Second, during the first great incalculable eon of cultivation of goodness andwisdom, the future Buddha Shakyamuni honored fifty-five thousand victors buddhasand traversed the paths of cultivation and application. During the second, hehonored sixty-six thousand victors and reached the seventh stage of awakening.During the third, he honored seventy-seven thousand victors, actualized thethree pure stages of awakening and completed the tenth stage. These threeprogressions through the paths and stages of awakening lasted a total of threegreat incalculable eons.Third, thirty-four lifetimes from among the past lives of the Buddha recountedby the Buddha in that category of his instructions follow.First, born into a brahmin family, he became a renunciant and in retreat gavemany spiritual teachings to a circle of disciples whom he kept for a long time.Then, motivated by intense compassion, he offered his body to a starving tigressin a jungle.Second, as king of the land of Shibi, he distributed gifts of whatever anyonewished: to a brahmin he gave his eyes. To test his motivation, the brahmin askedhim questions: by the power of his declaration of the truth, the king gaineddivine sight.Third, as the king of the region of Kosala, he remembered that his attainment ofthe riches of the monarchy was due to the ripened effect of his gift of ahandful of warm food during a past life. He recounted his memory of that pastlife to the queen, who then remembered her past lives.Fourth, as the merchant Joy in Giving, he crossed the fires of hell manifestedby demons to offer alms to a solitary sage.Fifth, as the merchant Invincible, although Shakra made his fortune dissipate,he gave in charity the profit from selling grass. The god was pleased, restoredhis wealth, and caused his food and wealth to become endless and everincreasing.Sixth, as a rabbit, he gave spiritual teachings to animals, such as an otter, ajackal, and a monkey. To welcome Shakra, who came in the form of a brahmin, heleapt into a fire and was burned. The gods gave him offerings and many praises.Seventh, as the brahmin Agastya, he stayed in retreat. Shakra made his fooddisappear to cause him hardship. Some dry leaves were left over: he pleasedShakra by offering these to the god when he manifested as a brahmin guest.Eighth, as King Force of Love, he gave his own flesh and blood to five brothernoxious spirits. As a result of his aspirations, they later became the fiveexcellent individuals of his entourage (his first disciples after he becameBuddha).Ninth, as Prince All-Liberating, after having distributed gifts of everythinganyone wished, he gave a perfumed elephant: the law banished him from the land.He then went to Mount White Lotus, where he fully offered his very dear sons,daughters, and wife.Tenth, as king Maker of Gifts and Offerings, because his subjects killed animalsto make offerings, he skillfully instituted laws to execute persons doing evilacts, to make offerings of them. In fear, his subjects abjured wrongdoing andwere thus led to lives of joy and happiness.The second set of ten: Eleventh, as Shakra, he was presumed missing during abattle with the demigods and thus left behind by the gods’ armies. To preventhis chariot from destroying a nest of garudas at the top of a tree by theroadside, he turned around. Seeing him do so, the demigods scattered and ran.The gods’ armies witnessed this and asked his forgiveness.Twelfth, as a brahmin, his preceptor wished to test his character and asked himto steal others’ wealth; when he refused, the teacher was pleased.Thirteenth, as a king, although he desired an entrancing woman whose extremebeauty made men mad upon sight, he resisted her. Her husband, a governmentofficial, tried by a variety of means to offer her to the king, but he developedpatience to bear what was unbearable and finally did not accept.Fourteenth, as a captain named Good Crossing, when his ocean ship was blown offcourse to various inaccessible places, such as Swampy Grove, the force of histruthful declaration that he had never killed any being caused the ship, ladenwith jewels, to return home in one day.Fifteenth, as a fish, to save the lives of the fish who were about to die astheir lake dried up, his declaration of truth brought rain, saving them.Sixteenth, as a young pheasant, during a forest fire, his declaration of truthstopped the fire’s spread.Seventeenth, as Shakra, the force of his emanation’s description of the faultsof drinking alcohol led the king, subjects, and court to renounce alcohol and toapply themselves to ennobling acts.Eighteenth, as a wealthy man, he gave his fortune away and became a renunciant.He did not heed pleading to reconsider and spoke of the shortcomings of homelife.Nineteenth, as a brahmin, he became a renunciant with his brothers, sisters, andservants. He stayed in retreat eating lotus roots, but although Shakra hid thelotus roots and his body became weak, he did not become angry. Shakra then askedhis forgiveness.Twentieth, as a merchant chief, he heard the untrue news that his wife had saidhe would soon become a renunciant. This minor event changed him: his mind turnedto retreat. He then skillfully led his family and friends toward renunciation.The third set of ten: Twenty-first, as Crown Ornament Awakening, he and his wifebecame renunciants and entered retreat. However, the king stole his wife andtreated him contemptuously but he did not become angry. Later the king bowed tohim respectfully and became his servant.Twenty-second, as the king of geese, he and his official were caught in a trap.With his official he gave spiritual teaching to the king and his court, who infaith offered him gifts and praise.Twenty-third, as Great Awakening, through miracles he skillfully led the kingand officials away from wrong views to the excellent path.Twenty-fourth, as a monkey, he carried and led someone who had fallen down acliff to a safe place, but although that person tried to kill him, hecompassionately showed him the path and his homeland.Twenty-fifth, as the wild animal sharabha [a lionlike animal with eight legs],he showed a safe place and indicated the path to a killer, a king who had fallendown a cliff, so that he entered spiritual practice.Twenty-sixth, as a spotted deer, a person he brought to safety from beingcarried away by a torrent recounted this to others. The king’s army surroundedthe deer and tried to kill him but the soldiers were tamed by his spiritualteachings.Twenty-seventh, as a monkey, when the king’s army threw various weapons, he madea path with his own body on the treetops, and thus rescued a pack of monkeysfrom danger and inspired faith in the king’s subjects.Twenty-eighth, as the seer Patient Speech, when a king’s wives had faith in him,the king became furious with desire. He had the seer’s limbs cut off—the earthopened up and the king fell to the hells.Twenty-ninth, as Brahma, he gave spiritual teachings to a king who held wrongviews: the king believed him and led his subjects to ennobling acts andhappiness.Thirtieth, as an elephant, he showed the path to seven hundred persons who hadbeen punished by the king with exile in the wilderness. To feed them, he jumpedinto a ravine, thus offering his own life to save the lives of others.Fourth, a set of four: Thirty-first, as Prince Moon, he stopped Sudasa’s sonfrom killing humans and eating their flesh: when he was captured by the killerand carried to his place, his declaration of truth caused the killer to havefaith. Sudasa’s son took the four sacred vows, released his captives, andabjured negative acts, thus making everyone secure.Thirty-second, as a prince born in an iron house, he became disillusioned withlife while at a jasmine flower festival. He became a renunciant, stayed inretreat, and led others to spiritual practice.Thirty-third, as a water buffalo, when tormented in many ways by a monkey ridingroughly on him, and so on, he was patient. When he answered a noxious spirit’squestions by saying that one must meditate on patience, that spirit developedfaith and left.Thirty-fourth, as a woodpecker, he removed a bone stuck in a lion’s throat, butwhen the lion later forgot his kindness and was angry when he begged for food,the bird did not become angry and was praised by the gods.Third, this section has five parts. First, this section has two parts. First,the domain of equanimity is beings in general—enemies, friends, and those youregard as neither. Second, during lifetimes spent wandering in the round ofrebirth without beginning or end, your enemies were once extremely beneficialfriends and your friends were once enemies who caused you incalculable harm. Ifyou treat enemies as friends, they will surely return this with helpfulness,while help to friends is most often repaid with harm. Therefore, rest inequanimity toward others—give up attachment to friends, feel no hatred towardenemies, and regard beings in general with equanimity.Second, this section has two parts. First, there is not even one being who hasnot been your parent; at that time they helpfully protected you withincalculable kindness. To return that aid, repay them with helpfulness. Second,endeavor to lead all beings to true happiness, both temporary—happiness withinthe round of rebirth—and permanent—happiness of transcendent states, andendeavor to lead them to the causes of happiness—ennobling acts.Third, this section has two parts. First, any existence that the limits of spacereach in the ten directions is filled by sentient beings. Since their lives arefilled with the sufferings created by karma and mental afflictions produced byignorance, they experience only the causes of suffering—corrupting acts—andthose acts’ results. Second, every being of the six kinds, your venerablemother, is constantly tormented by the causes and effects of suffering and willnever become free from the great prison pit of existence. Consideration ofbeings’ condition induces intolerably intense compassion: think, “I will freethem from suffering and its causes!”Fourth, this section has two parts. First, the domain of sympathetic joy is anybeing who acts nobly or enjoys happiness. Second, when seeing or hearing ofthose who are comfortable and happy, feel more joy than if this experience wereyour own: gradually increase this sympathetic joy until it becomes immeasurable.Fifth, begin with meditation on those beings related to you—your close circle offriends, family, and countrymen. Then renounce partiality by meditating on allbeings, such as those of the four heavens of Brahma, thus making the meditationimmeasurable.Chapter 3 has four parts. First, according to the mind only tradition, acandidate for the arising of the vows of awakened mind must be a person whokeeps one of the seven kinds of individual liberation vows. However, the middleway tradition teaches that even such beings as gods, nagas, or noxious spiritscan be appropriate candidates.Second, classification by nature yields two to six categories:Two: uplift of the mind to awakening related to either aspiration or applicationThree: the mind related to training in ethical conduct, meditation, and sublimeinsightFour: on the paths of cultivation and application, the uplift of the mind toawakening is of conduct based on devoted interest. On the first to seventhstages of awakening, the uplift of the mind to awakening is of higher puremotivation. On the three pure stages of awakening, the uplift of the mind toawakening is of spiritual maturity. At the stage of enlightenment, the uplift ofthe mind to awakening is of abandonment of obscurations.Five: uplift of the mind to awakening on each of the five pathsSix: uplift of the mind to awakening of each of the six perfectionsClassification by levels is illustrated by twenty-two examples: (1) the ground,(2) gold, (3) the moon, (4) fire, (5) treasure, (6) a mine, (7) a lake, (8) avajra, (9) a mountain, (10) medicine, (11) a spiritual guide, (12) awish-fulfilling jewel, (13) the sun, (14) a song, (15) a monarch, (16) atreasury, (17) a highway, (18) a horse, (19) a reservoir, (20) an echo, (21) ariver, and (22) a cloud.The examples are joined to their meanings in the following ways: The first threeexamples are assigned respectively to the awakened mind on the lesser, middle,and higher levels of the path of cultivation. (1) Directed intent is like theground; (2) motivation, gold; (3) higher motivation, the moon. The next relatesto the awakened mind on the four levels of the path of application: (4)application is like fire. The following ten examples relate to the ten stages ofawakening, respectively: (5) generosity is like a treasure; (6) ethical conduct,like a mine; (7) patience, a lake; (8) diligence, a vajra; (9) meditativestability, a mountain; (10) sublime insight, medicine; (11) skillful means, aspiritual guide; (12) aspiration, a wish-fulfilling jewel; (13) strength, thesun; (14) the perfection of wisdom, a beautiful song. The following relateequally to the eighth, ninth, and tenth stages of awakening: (15) clairvoyanceis like a monarch; (16) the cultivation of goodness and wisdom, a treasury; (17)qualities consistent with the aspects of awakening, a highway; (18) bothcompassion and insight, a horse; (19) both a retentive memory and confidence, areservoir. The following three examples relate to the tenth stage of awakeningand its activity for sentient beings performed through great wisdom andenlightened activity: (20) the festival of instructions is like an echo; (21)the single path to be traversed, a river; (22) the body of ultimateenlightenment and its related factors, a cloud.Second, the benefits of uplifting the mind to awakening are elimination of everyfear, anxiety, and suffering of the miserable existences within the round ofrebirth. You become a worthy recipient for the veneration of all beings,including the gods. Your cultivation of ennobling acts becomes endless and everincreasing. Uplifting the mind to awakening becomes the root or the seed ofspiritual practice; a medicine that cures the sickness of suffering; and a sunthat induces the dawn of wisdom. The infinite and vast qualities of upliftingthe mind to awakening cause rapid attainment of the supreme state ofenlightenment.Third, this section has two parts. First, to prepare, arrange sacredrepresentations of wisdom body, speech, and mind upon an altar and place manyofferings before them. Then recite, “I invite the assembly of transcendentvictors of the three times and the entire assembly of the victors’ spiritualheirs to witness the uplift of my mind to sublime awakening. Now that you havecome to this place, please be seated on this supreme seat and impressive thronein this fine, beautiful place.”Second, this section has seven parts. First, “In deep homage, expressedrespectfully by my body imagined multiplied in numbers equal to the atoms of allrealms; with prayers in speech; and with faith in mind, I bow to the spiritualmaster and to the victors and their spiritual heirs.”Second, “To the supreme gathering of recipients of offerings, I offer both realand imagined offerings—the seven offerings of common use, the pleasures of thefive senses, the eight auspicious signs and the eight auspicious substances, theseven possessions of a universal monarch, the seven semiprecious objects, andall the wealth and splendor of worlds filling space throughout the cosmos.”Three, “I admit with sincere regret any evil act I have committed due to theforce of karma and mental afflictions throughout my lifetimes without beginningor end.”Fourth, “I wholeheartedly rejoice in the accumulation of ennobling acts and thefully positive karma of every being, ordinary and exalted.”Fifth, “For the sake of deluded beings, I request you to forever turn the greatwheel of the doctrine, which guides beings according to their needs.”Sixth, “I request you to not transcend suffering but to remain in the worlduntil the sea of the round of rebirth runs dry.”Seventh, “In order that all beings be liberated, I dedicate to supreme awakeningthis vast accumulation of ennobling acts generated by the cultivation ofgoodness and wisdom.”Fourth, this section has three parts. First, the main ceremony for the uplift ofthe mind to awakening includes both aspiration and application: aspiration isthe wish to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings; application isto undertake the practice, the cause of that attainment.Second, on bended knee with hands joined in prayer, with intense faith andrespect, repeat the following:From this moment forth, until I reach the heart of awakening, I take refuge inthe Buddha, the doctrine, and the sublime gathering of the spiritual community.Victors of the ten directions and your spiritual heirs, heed me! Just as theblissful buddhas of the past and their spiritual heirs uplifted their minds tosublime awakening and engaged in every aspect of its training, I uplift my mindto sublime awakening and will engage in the entire training for the sake of allbeings.I will liberate listener and solitary sage arhats who are not yet free fromcognitive obscurations and static peace. I will liberate ordinary individualsand exalted beings who are not yet free from the two obscurations. I will givesupreme release to those who are bound, beings assailed by extreme torment inthe three miserable existences. And I will place all beings in the transcendentstate free of abiding, beyond the suffering of the round of rebirth’s wheel ofinterdependent arising.By repeating these lines three times, you accept the bodhisattva vows.Third, “Today I have become a child of the victors; a recipient of honor by godsand humans; a supreme guide for beings; and one who has obtained the crowningname bodhisattva: In rapturous joy, I will aid beings.”The measure of the goodness of this is such that victors as numerous as thesands of the Ganges could not completely express it during eons as numerous asthe sands of the Ganges.This concludes the commentary to the words of “The Foundation of the MiddleWay,” Book 8 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, awork that elucidates all ways of spiritual development.BOOK 9: THE PATH OF THE MIDDLE WAYBook 9, “The Path of the Middle Way,” has three chapters: “A General Explanationof Bodhisattvas’ Training—the Three Kinds of Ethical Conduct”; “A DetailedPresentation of the Six Transcendent Perfections”; and “A Specific Presentationof the Thirty-Seven Facets and Ten Stages of Awakening on the Four Paths ofTraining.”Chapter 1 has two parts. First, after you uplift your mind to sublime awakeningas described, you engage in all facets of the training. Renew your commitment toawakened mind during the six periods of day and night. Employ various means togradually remove every stain that obscures your innate constituentenlightenment, buddha nature.Second, this section has two parts. First, this section has two parts. First,there are three kinds of ethical conduct: restraint from faulty conduct,gathering ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.In relation to all three, seven causes weaken these forms of ethical conduct.Three impede sublime insight: abandonment of hearing the doctrine, abandonmentof reflection, and abandonment of meditation. Four are faults in altruisticacts: extreme laziness, conduct that causes others to lose faith, lack ofcompassionate motivation, and counterproductive conduct.Rely on the three causes for the integrity of the bodhisattvas’ training. Ofthese, first, three recollections preserve its integrity during this life:recollection of the benefits of uplifting the mind, the disadvantages of havingthat uplift deteriorate, and the difficulty of attaining such mental uplift.Bring these repeatedly to mind.Second, three things ensure the integrity of the bodhisattvas’ training duringfuture lifetimes so it becomes irreversible: performance of the seven-partservice three times a day, supplications to the victors and their spiritualheirs, and renunciation of fully negative activity contrary to the doctrine.Third, five things to cherish maintain the integrity of the bodhisattvas’training both now and later: to cherish the domain of spiritual practice,sentient beings, more than yourself; to cherish what is to be practiced, thedoctrine, more than wealth; to cherish the main point, awakened mind, more thanyour heart; to cherish the principal contributing factor to this path, yourspiritual guide, more than your parents; and to cherish what is to be attained,enlightenment, more than possessions.Among nine things that enhance awakened mind, five recollections involveremembering the following: the instability of composite phenomena, theinevitability of suffering, the benefits of spiritual life, the outstandingpositive qualities of the teacher who reveals the meaning, and the benefits ofthe awakened mind. Four acts complete the nine: looking with eyes ofmindfulness, movement by the supreme horse of diligence, encouragement by theriding crop of disengagement, and a mind turned toward the city of freedom.Ethical conduct’s standard enumeration is as three. Bodhisattvas’ actsdefinitely help both the doer and others: altruistic acts bring others’ streamsof being to spiritual maturity; restraint from faulty conduct and the gatheringof positive qualities bring your own stream of being to spiritual maturity.Therefore, the standard enumeration is as three.Second, this section has three parts. First, this section has two parts. First,two traditions describe the ethical conduct of restraint from faulty conduct.The tradition of Nagarjuna follows The Discourse of the Bodhisattva Sky Essenceand The Discourse of Skillful Means and is delineated by Shantideva in TheCompendium of Training.According to those sources, there are twenty fundamental downfalls and eightyreprehensible acts, presented as follows. Five definite downfalls apply torulers: to confiscate offerings to the three jewels, to renounce the sacreddoctrine, to punish ennobling spiritual practice, to commit one of the five actsof immediate fruition, and to hold wrong views. Five definite downfalls apply togovernment officials: in anger, to destroy by fire or other means, villages—asettlement that consists of one clan or more; provinces—an area where the fourcastes of persons live; cities—an area where the eighteen kinds of artisanslive; towns—where many merchants gather; or surrounding areas—large areas, suchas Champaka.Eighteen definite downfalls apply to ordinary persons: to teach emptiness tothose who are mentally unprepared, making them apprehensive; to induce a personwho has entered the great way to change course and to adhere to the lesser way;to cause another to abandon the individual liberation vows—the lesser way—toadhere to the great way; to maintain that the lesser way does not overcomemental afflictions and to encourage others in that belief; to criticize anotherand to praise yourself, driven by jealousy toward another bodhisattva; in orderto receive gain and honor, to commit the highest form of lying, such as toclaim, “I have direct realization of the profound instructions of emptiness!”although you do not have such realization; to create through slander a breachbetween a person in power, such as a king, and a practitioner of theseteachings, then to cause the powerful person to punish the fully ordainedindividual with a fine. If the practitioner then misappropriates offerings tothe three jewels to give as a bribe to the slanderer, the fault is incurred whenthe slanderer accepts the bribe, whether they keep it themselves or give it tothe powerful person. The last is to confiscate the possessions of a renunciantmeditator and to give them to a reciter of texts or to induce another to give upcontemplative practice, such as tranquility.In addition to these eighteen, relinquishment of the aspiration and applicationto the mind of awakening complete the twenty.Of the eighty reprehensible acts, twenty-four concern disregard of happiness andsuffering; sixteen, disregard of spiritual practice—a total of forty; eachdifferentiated by temporary or permanent disregard gives the total of eighty.Second, Asanga’s tradition of training in aspiration stipulates diligence inthese four points: to not mentally abandon any being, to recall the benefits ofthe awakened mind, to cultivate the stores of goodness and wisdom, and to takethe commitment of uplifting your mind to awakening and then to train in “takingand sending” during the six sessions of day and night.Further, renounce the four negative acts: to deceive the spiritual master orthose worthy of veneration, to provoke regret toward an act that is not to beregretted, to criticize holy bodhisattvas by proclaiming their faults, and todeceive or cheat any sentient being.Practice their opposites, the four positive acts: to never knowingly tell a lie,to develop the perception of bodhisattvas as the Teacher, to remain steadfast inhigher motivation without deception, and to lead all sentient beings to thegreat way.Training in application includes not committing the four fundamental downfalls:to praise oneself and to criticize others driven by desire for gain (such asofferings) or for honor (such as a given seat); out of greed, to not giveobjects or spiritual instruction to those who are suffering and withoutprotection; to not listen but to remain angry and to inflict harm with physicalabuse, even though another has admitted their mistake; and to present a falseimpression of yourself as a spiritual person although you have abandoned thegreat way.The forty-six reprehensible acts are divided between thirty-four that contradictgathering ennobling qualities and twelve that contradict altruistic acts.Second, the ethical conduct of gathering ennobling qualities is the intention(and related attitudes) to practice ennobling acts, epitomized by the sixtranscendent perfections. These six have the following characteristics: they arefree from what is inconsistent with each; they are guided by absence of conceptsin relation to the three spheres (of agent, act, and recipient); they fulfillothers’ wishes; and the teaching of their doctrine induces maturation intoawakening.The literal meaning of the term “transcendent perfection” is to pass beyondennobling acts of worldly persons, hearers, or solitary sages. Theclassification of each of the six transcendent perfections yields six foreach—for example, the generosity of generosity, etc. Their standard enumerationcategorizes generosity, ethical conduct, and patience as training in higherethical conduct; meditative stability as training in higher meditative states;sublime insight as training in higher sublime insight; and diligence as theircommon companion. Their order has been determined according to cause andeffect—the former produces the latter; and the latter are comparatively higherand more subtle than the former.They are practiced as follows. Gifts are given without expectation of reward orpositive fruition. Ethical conduct is honored without a wish for a pleasantrebirth in happy existences. Patience is meditated upon without the thought ofany sentient being as an adversary. Diligence is undertaken in natural delighttoward the gathering of all your own and others’ ennobling qualities. Meditativestability is settling in evenness within meditative stability that rids you ofself-absorbed states which characterize the divine realms of meditativestability and formlessness. Sublime insight is practiced without separation fromthe skillful means of supreme compassion.All six transcendent perfections are guided by six sacred aspects: their sacredsupport—the presence of awakened mind; their sacred substance—impartial,all-inclusive generosity, and the rest; their sacred purposefulactivity—application to that which aids sentient beings; their sacred skillfulmeans—acts guided by nonconceptual sublime insight in relation to the threespheres (of agent, act, and recipient); their sacred dedication—to unsurpassableawakening; and their sacred purity—conduct that effectively counteracts the twoobscurations.The benefits are these: gathered within the context of the six perfections, thecultivation of goodness becomes the cause of the wisdom bodies that have form;and the cultivation of wisdom, the cause of the body of ultimate enlightenment.Third, this section has two parts. First, the ethical conduct of altruistic actsconsists of the four means to gather disciples: To summon disciples by means ofthe signal of gifts of necessities; to draw their interest by pleasant speech;to guide them to practice the meaning of the ways of spiritual developmentsuited to their degree of acumen; to have your conduct conform to the teachings,thus making others conscientious.The characteristic of this ethical conduct is acts dedicated to others’ benefit.Its classification is the four means to gather disciples. Its standardenumeration is as four, since they include every means to accomplish others’happiness and benefit.Second, when bodhisattvas travel, they think, “May all sentient beings enter thepath of the exalted ones.” When sitting, they think, “May all sentient beingsattain the Vajra Seat.” When eating, they think, “May all sentient beings obtainthe food of meditation.” When sleeping, they think, “May all beings attain theBuddha’s body of ultimate enlightenment.” In these and other ways during thefour forms of activity or in any act, sustain mindfulness, circumspection, andcare; and recite with pure motivation any suitable words of prayers ofaspiration, such as those found in The Flower Ornament Discourse of perfectlypure conduct.Second, this section has three parts. First, the four parameters are defined byactual downfalls—for example, to take life out of anger; apparent downfallswhich are not in fact downfalls—that is, to kill out of altruism;nondownfalls—to not kill out of compassion; and apparent nondownfalls which arein fact downfalls—to not kill even though it would help others.Second, the permissions and prohibitions can be understood as follows: If youare aware that a situation has three aspects—that an act helps others, that itwill become helpful, and that your ennobling qualities will increase rather thanbe obscured, the seven corrupting acts of body and voice are permitted if theywill surely help another. In that case, though they appear otherwise, theiressence is ennobling.Third, this section has two parts. First, if a downfall has been incurred due toany of four causes—ignorance, carelessness, mental afflictions, ordisrespect—the means to acknowledge it in Nagarjuna’s tradition is as follows:At each of six junctures—sunrise, noon, and afternoon (three daytime junctures)and evening, midnight, and dawn (three nighttime junctures)—determine whether ornot a fault has been incurred. If so, and if the fault concerns a downfall thathas exceeded any period, the means to restore the vows is to make heartfeltprayers to the bodhisattva Sky Essence at dawn.Additional downfalls can be purified by recitation of The Discourse of the ThreeAggregations at the six junctures of the day.Second, this section has two parts. First, according to Asanga’s tradition, thefundamental downfall is committed by mentally abandoning another being;auxiliary downfalls, by committing one of the four negative acts. Thisrelinquishment of aspiration, the fundamental basis of awakened mind, damagesand causes the relinquishment of what is supported, application to thebodhisattva path.If a defeating act—to criticize others and to praise yourself for gain or glory,for example—is committed with full involvement and the following four aspects,it constitutes a downfall of serious involvement: to commit the act regularly,to do so without the slightest quiver of shame or embarrassment, to take joyfulpleasure in it, and to consider it as positive. Since this destroys the vows, itis called “a defeating act.”Medium involvement is similar in every respect, except for the presence ofslight shame and embarrassment: you will stop if encouraged by others to do so.Slight involvement is characterized by similar aspects and more intense shameand embarrassment, so that even without others’ encouragement, you will soontake the initiative to stop the act. Acts done with the latter two degrees ofinvolvement do not constitute relinquishment of the vows.Second, to repair the vows, if a defeating act has been committed, the vows mustbe taken again. In the case of an act done with a medium degree of involvement,this resembles a defeating act of the monastic code of conduct: the act must beadmitted before three or more persons. In the case of a lesser degree ofinvolvement, formal admission must be made before one person. If this is notpossible, admit the act mentally in the presence of the victors and theirspiritual heirs and retake the commitment.Chapter 2 has two parts. First, at the outset of training in the conduct of thesix transcendent perfections for the sake of all beings, recognize that allsentient beings have been your mother in lifetimes since time immemorial andrepeatedly recall their kindness in helpfully nurturing you at that time. Torepay their kindness, accept the responsibility to help them reach happiness.Further, now that the opportunity to help them has arrived, do whatever you can.Concerning this, the following thirteen considerations make practice for thebenefit of sentient beings imperative: (1) recognition that all beings have beenyour parents and recollection of their kindness; (2) motivation to return thatkindness; (3) they committed wrongdoing on your behalf; (4) since they wish forhappiness rather than suffering, you must make them happy; (5) you now have theopportunity to guide them; (6) you must do whatever is beneficial to helpothers; (7) since you have not realized emptiness, you must guide sentientbeings through compassion; (8) you uplifted your mind to awakening for the sakeof sentient beings; (9) they are the focus of your accomplishment of awakening;(10) if you actually help others, you naturally accomplish your own welfare;(11) if you help sentient beings, this pleases the buddhas; (12) you must helpothers, since to not do so is to fall into the ways of the hearers or solitarysages; and (13) once you realize the ultimate, you can easily help others; thus,you must work for their benefit.The four marshaled forces are interest—with interest toward the benefits of theawakened mind, practice ennobling acts and renounce wrongdoing; stability—makethe awakened mind unalterably stable; rejection—without harming sentient beings,occasionally disregard the lesser aspects of training; and joy—be joyfullyenthusiastic in helping sentient beings and in accomplishing your training.Since all beings and yourself equally yearn for happiness and shun suffering,meditate on yourself and others as equals. Send your happiness and ennoblingacts to sentient beings and accept as your own their suffering and wrongdoing.In this way, exchange yourself for others, considering others’ welfare moreimportant than your own.Second, this section has six parts. First, the three kinds of generosity offeredto needy beings are gifts of material objects, spiritual teaching, and refugefrom fear. Material generosity can be expressed through simple giving—any wealthor object desired; great giving—such as the gift of your child or spouse; orextreme giving—”one’s head or limbs,” referring to gifts such as your flesh orblood. Lesser spiritual generosity is expressed by gifts of paper, ink, orbooks; and great spiritual generosity, by teaching the Buddhist ways ofspiritual development appropriate to the recipient. Generosity of refuge fromfear is to offer freedom from danger, such as that due to enemies, fire, water,ravines, poison, or weapons.Second, the three kinds of ethical conduct are restraint from faulty conduct,gathering ennobling qualities, and altruistic acts.Third, this section has seven parts. First, the three kinds of patience are toaccept suffering without regret in the course of hardship in spiritual practice;to not dwell on harm others have done, in consideration of the drawback of angeras a response; and definite realization of the teachings—to compassionately workfor others without becoming disheartened and to not be anxious toward profoundemptiness understood through sublime insight.Second, patience constitutes supreme goodness and the most exemplary asceticpractice; anger causes rebirth in the hells: avoid it in every situation.Third, many things cause harm: it would be extremely difficult to neutralizethem all; however, if you only subdue your own mind, you will neutralize suchnegative circumstances.Fourth, by using harmful circumstances, you perfect transcendent patience. Youcan thus feel gratitude toward your enemies in the thought that no one is kinderthan they.Fifth, all harm, disturbances, and suffering arise from your karma; therefore,it is vital to discipline your mind, the source of all karma.Sixth, if what is undesirable can be changed, why be unhappy with it? If itcannot be changed, of what use is sadness? With these reflections, practicepatience.Seventh, the object of your anger and the angry individual both lack anintrinsic nature, and are naturally empty. If there is no intrinsic self, whatself is there to cling to? What cannot be tolerated?Fourth, this section has four parts. First, the three kinds of diligence to beundertaken are the diligence of armor—motivation undeterred by anycircumstances; application to acts—enthusiastic dedication to the attainment ofthe qualities of renunciation and realization; and joyful service to sentientbeings in thought, word, and deed.Second, three kinds of laziness must be rejected: attachment to negative acts—tonot apply yourself to spiritual practice due to attachment to negative acts thatshould be renounced; inertia—to give up your application to spiritual practiceupon seeing its hardships; and underestimating yourself—the thought that someonelike yourself is incapable of developing such qualities.Third, diligence attracts the praise of all worldly persons and leads to theaccomplishment of any goal, the full increase of every quality, and the quickachievement of enlightenment.Fourth, all worldly and transcendent fortune and excellence are achieved throughthe force of physical energy, verbal effort, and mental diligence: developenduring, enthusiastic diligence.Fifth, this section has six parts. First, renunciation of the many forms ofdistraction and busyness is a requisite for the practice of meditativestability. Having reflected that all sensual pleasures and possessions partakeof the nature of impermanence, you should remain in isolated places.Second, the accumulation of wealth, objects, and possessions is detrimental tomeditation; to guard what one has and to search for more incurs physical,verbal, and mental suffering. Wealth’s vanity, craving, and attachment, andgreedy unwillingness to share lead to the miserable existences.Third, companionship with spiritually immature, ordinary persons increasescorrupting acts, wrongdoing, and clouds your cultivation of ennobling acts. Suchpersons are difficult to please regardless of what you do; their many plansmultiply; and they foster agitation and serious arguments. Such friendships arelike poisonous snakes.Fourth, until you gain meditative stability, life in your homeland is deceptive;therefore you should remain in retreat in a pleasant place on a mountainside.Fifth, by staying in strict retreat, various qualities of experience andrealization naturally and effortlessly arise. Just seven steps toward retreatwith the wish to stay there surpass the goodness of an eon of offerings to thevictors.Sixth, the main practice is the cultivation of meditative stability. Assume thephysical seven-point posture, breathe very calmly, and settle your mind focusedon a support, such as the Buddha’s form.In this practice, discursiveness and examination constitute the first level ofmeditative stability; examination without discursive thought, the second levelof meditative stability; to remain without either discursive thought orexamination, the third level; and to remain one-pointed after freeing yourselffrom attachment to the third level, the fourth. Since these four levels, as wellas meditation on the four levels of the composure of formlessness, lead toordinary existences, they are called “meditative stability practiced by thespiritually immature.”After you enter the Buddhist path and you reach the paths of cultivation andapplication, meditation on these paths leads to the actualization of freedom:they are thus called “meditative stability that fully discerns the meaning.”Flawless meditative states of exalted bodhisattvas who rest on the first orhigher stages of awakening accomplish “the noble sacred meditative stability ofthe blissful buddhas.”The distinctions among these three meditative states should be understood. Thosewho have not entered the path meditate upon the practice of the spirituallyimmature—the four levels of meditative stability and the four formless levels;those who have entered it, full discernment of the meaning; and exaltedbodhisattvas who have reached the stages of awakening, the noble sacredmeditative stability of the blissful buddhas.The nine ways of placing the mind are to place the mind as the Buddha taught,continual placing, repeated placing, firm placing, disciplined placing, calming,complete calming, one-pointed placement, and placement in evenness.The meaning of these nine terms are as follows: first, to place the mind on afocal point; second, to place it there continually; third, to relinquishdistraction when you are aware of it; fourth, once distraction is relinquished,to repeatedly place the mind on the focal point; fifth, to develop joy; sixth,to see the shortcomings of distraction and thus to fully calm unhappiness;seventh, to rid yourself of such things as torpor and sleepiness; eighth, tohave no engagement in concepts since you have no obvious intentional effort; andninth, the mind settles when you make it even.The ten discordant influences are to listen to news of mundane affairs; to drawpictures; to write poetry; to consider the planets and stars’ conjunctions (thatis, astrology); ownership of food and possessions; to think of creating wealth,like a female cannibal spirit; to petition a ruler; to not ask questions of thewise; to be invited as a guest to parties; and to associate and live withothers.The six impediments are laziness, forgetting the focus of the meditation,depression, elation, lack of effort, and effort.The eight mental formations of renunciation are the following. The first fourcounteract laziness: faith, directed intent, effort, and becoming well trained.These refer to fully confident faith in the positive qualities of meditativestates, and undertaking heartfelt diligent action. The force of these make themind pliable, which in turn leads to attainment of the happiness of awell-trained body and mind, which counteract laziness. Likewise, recollection isthe remedy to forgetting the focus of the meditation, mindfulness is the remedyto depression and elation, conscientiousness is the remedy for lack of effort,and equanimity is the remedy for effort. These eight mental formations ofrenunciation produce effective meditative states.To see all phenomena as an illusion and, within the experience of the meditativestate of illusion, to gain mastery in manifesting whatever one wishes like amagician is known as “the magic-like meditative state.” Bodhisattvas who havecomplete mastery at the eighth stage of awakening pursue all aspects ofawakening like a warrior entering battle; therefore their meditation is known as“the warrior’s movement meditative state.”To summarize the path of application (as a substage of the path of meditation),it is the stage at which no obscurations can deter you and all obscurations aredestroyed. To summarize the path without interruption, it is the stage at whichyou know that what is below it has been exhausted and will not arise. These twopaths of application and without interruption, respectively inferior andsupreme, can be summarized in other ways.Once you attain the essence of the path of application, past obscurations willnot return and any further obscurations are destroyed. The vajra-like meditativestate, included in the path without interruption, is itself the culmination ofwisdom, since in the next instant, the path of no further training arises. Thequalities of these three meditative states (illusion-like, warrior’s movement,and vajra-like) are the six forms of clairvoyance: actualization of theknowledge of the domain of miracles; knowledge of divine hearing; knowledge ofothers’ thoughts; knowledge of recollection of past lives; knowledge of death,transmigration, and rebirth; and knowledge of the cessation of contamination.Once these perceptions are refined, divine sight, clairvoyance, and miraculouspowers are accomplished.Sixth, this section has two parts. First, the ultimate view is that the sense ofthere being an autonomous identity in phenomena and the individual sense of selfare false because their objects lack an intrinsic nature. To realize the meaningof this view free from all formulations, sublime insight gained in hearing thedoctrine, and reflecting and meditating upon it, produces precise knowledge,overcomes accumulated mental afflictions, and leads to transcendence ofexistence.Second, this section has three parts. First, this section has two parts. First,this section also has two parts. First, hearing concerns analysis and what isanalyzed. Analysis that reveals the true state of reality is the definitivemeaning; analysis that reveals the means to enter the basic character of beingis inductive meaning.Second, this section has two parts. First, the two levels of meaning, definitiveand inductive, are elucidated by intention and indirect intention. Intentioncomprises four kinds: (1) Intention directed toward evenness is illustrated bythe statement, “At that time, I was the Transcendent One All-Seeing,” said withthe intention directed toward evenness within the body of ultimateenlightenment. (2) Intention directed toward other meanings is illustrated bythe statement, “All phenomena lack an essential nature,” said with the intentiondirected toward the three perspectives of the lack of an essential nature. (3)Intention directed toward other times can be illustrated by the statement, “Youwill attain enlightenment by just remembering the name Buddha StainlessMoonlight.” (4) Intention directed toward individuals’ attitudes is illustratedby praise of generosity, directed toward those who hold the view that ethicalconduct is supreme.Second, indirect intention comprises four kinds: (1) Indirect intention inrespect to entry into the teaching is illustrated by the statement, “Formexists,” made in order that the auditor enter the great way. The person entersthe teaching, whereas the consideration of the speaker was that all appearancesexist like dreams. (2) Indirect intention with respect to characteristics isillustrated by the statement, “All phenomena lack an essential nature,” made tofoster the understanding of the true state, which lacks an essence. (3) Indirectintention in respect to antidotes is illustrated by the example when the Buddhaunderstood that a person thought the Buddha’s body was small and inferior, hesaid, “At that time, I was the Buddha Illuminator.” The hearer understood thatenlightenment’s form bodies were equal, whereas the speaker’s consideration wasthat his and any buddha’s cultivation of goodness and wisdom, body of ultimateenlightenment, and benefit for beings are equal. (4) Indirect intention inrespect to interpretation is illustrated by the example of statements that areextremely difficult to understand, made to correct the fault of those who think,“This teaching is inferior because it is easy to understand.” Such statementscould include, “You must kill your father and mother,” which uses parents as ametaphor for the mental formations of the desire for and grasping toward theround of rebirth.Second, this section has two parts. First, this section also has two parts.First, what is analyzed—phenomena—reflects relative or ultimate truth. Relativetruth, the way things appear, can be either inaccurate or accurate. Whateverarises within an ordinary sentient being’s natural linguistic and conceptualframework—inaccurate appearances, inaccurate grasping, and inaccurateconsciousness—is misleading relative truth: it is deceptive, unreal, changing,and suffering.Second, accurate relative truth has two parts: The first does not deviate fromthe result: it is wisdom’s basis and path, with their qualities. Althoughtreading this path is impermanent, it is called accurate since it leads to theground of the basic character of being. The second is accurate because theresult is attained: the form bodies of the buddhas, with their wisdoms, abidingin the Highest Pure Land.Second, ultimate truth is the true state of the basic character of being—deepand calm, free from all formulations of belief systems, devoid of premises. Thisis known as “the originally pure basic space.”Second, this section has three parts. First, subjective experience as well isbased in this true nature; even at moments when subjective experience seems toarise or cease, it is free from all extremes that can be formulated concerningarising, resting, or ceasing. It partakes of the primordially pure nature of allphenomena, the interdependent origination of the basic character of being.Second, in the outer appearances of the five elements, and of seeds, sprouts,and fruit, each depend on the other—this is outer interdependent origination.The cycle from ignorance to aging and death is inner interdependent origination.Thus, all phenomena of the round of rebirth arise interdependently.Third, on the path, ignorance is recognized to be the source of the twelve linksof interdependent origination that produce the round of rebirth. Since thewisdom of awareness removes this source—ignorance—the impetus to enter existencedissipates and the abode of the round of rebirth is transcended. You actualizethe result, the state of the victors, then guide beings. This is theinterdependent origination of the transcendence of sorrow.Second, sublime insight gained from reflection is explained as follows: To guidefortunate disciples, contemplate the meaning of the words of teaching.Repeatedly examine the scripture and logic used in debate to stem misleadingbelief systems. Read the clear and profound written works, brief or extensive,and thoroughly examine your experience. Bring to completion any activity youchoose, guided by repeated reflection.Third, this section has eight parts. First, to gain sublime insight throughmeditation, meditate that phenomena of the round of rebirth and transcendentstates have not come into being, as in a dream. In the deluded sleep ofignorance, dreams of deluded perceptions arise. Without clinging to the variousobjects, subjects, and collections of discursive thoughts that appear, meditatethat they are like dreams.Second, as in a magical display, all phenomena are unceasing. There are fourforms of magic: natural magic, buddha nature (the sphere of the basis ofpurification); impure magic (the stains to be purified)—the myriad karma, mentalafflictions, and sufferings of the beings and worlds of the deluded perceptionswithin the round of rebirth; skillful magic (the agents of purification)—thepath of the thirty-seven facets of awakening; and wisdom magic (the result ofpurification)—the bodies, wisdoms, and spontaneous activity of enlightenment.As in the example of magic—the horses, oxen, and so on, manifested by amagician—meditate with a definite understanding that whatever you see, hear,recall, or think of has no intrinsic nature, like a magical display.Third, as in an optical illusion, all phenomena do not draw near. All form,sound, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, and phenomena have no reality, as in anoptical illusion. Develop skill in this and rest the mind, free fromformulations of thought and recollection.Fourth, as in a mirage, all phenomena do not go. Like those in a mirage, theappearances of existence don’t come into being, cease, or abide. Meditate thatjoy or pain, denial or affirmation, and dualistic clinging are like a mirage.Settle free from hope or fear, and from the mind’s outward or inward movement.Fifth, all phenomena, like the reflection of the moon on water, do not cease. Inempty appearances, emptiness appears. Know all clinging to the reality ofphenomena—appearances, sound, thought, existence, nonexistence—to be just theempty appearance of a reflection.Sixth, as in an echo, all phenomena have no permanence. All sounds, of praise orblame, pleasant or unpleasant, have no basis nor source, and not the leastintrinsic nature. Meditate that whatever appears is like an echo.Seventh, as in an ephemeral city of spirits, all phenomena are not multiple.From the moment such a city of spirits appears on the plain at twilight, it hasno intrinsic nature. Likewise, delusion’s perceptions within the round ofrebirth are unreal. Familiarize yourself with the meaning of that.Eighth, all phenomena, like an emanation, are not singular. All appearances—thefive elements, the environment, beings, karma, mental afflictions, suffering,the stages and paths of awakening—have in themselves no inherent existence. Iencourage you with these words: “Meditate continually on the meaning of theseeight!”Chapter 3 has four parts. First, the support for the path of cultivation refersto the meditator, anyone who has first uplifted their mind to awakening in thegreat way. The nature of the path of cultivation has three aspects: cause,result, and essence. Of these, the cause of the path of cultivation is thenaturally existent enlightened heritage, awakened by hearing the teachings ofthe great way and reflecting upon them. The path of cultivation leads to fourresults: the three paths of application, seeing, and meditation; and the path ofno further training.A description of the essence of the path of cultivation has four points: itsdefining characteristic, example, levels, and special attributes. First, thepath of cultivation’s characteristic is the ennobling act of remaininginseparable with the great way’s uplift of the mind to awakening from the timeyou enter the great way until the great way’s heat stage of the path ofapplication arises. That example can be appropriately designated as the greatway path of cultivation. Among the ennobling acts that cause attainment ofenlightenment, this path involves beginners’ collection of those acts thatinduce the arising in their conscious stream of being of the first instant ofthe distinct phases of the path of application that border the path of seeing,such as the great way’s heat stage of the path of application.Second, the example of the path of cultivation is any act performed after theinitial entry into the great way until the path of application arises, when suchacts are motivated by the desire for complete awakening. Acts that can inducethe arising of the path of application include ethical conduct; control of thesenses; conscientious eating of food in proper measure; diligence incontemplative practice during the first and last parts of the day, instead ofsleeping; joyful mindful living within the bounds of correct conduct; to notregret ennobling acts; enthusiasm, faith, devotion, and other ennobling actsthat lead to freedom; and sublime insight gained from hearing teachings,reflection, and meditation. These and other ennobling acts provoke the arisingof the path of application.Third, the path of cultivation has three levels: the lesser path of cultivation,the middle path of cultivation, and the higher path of cultivation.The lesser path marks the beginning to the three incalculable eons of spiritualpractice that cause the attainment of enlightenment. The lesser path is theperiod of meditation on the four forms of mindfulness; on this level of thepath, the time the path of application will arise is indefinite. The middle pathis the period of meditation on the four genuine renunciations; the time the pathof application will arise is definite—in a future lifetime. The higher path isthe period of meditation on the four supports for miraculous powers; the timethe path of application will arise is definite—in that same lifetime.The path of cultivation’s duration depends upon the uplift of the mind toawakening: “The inspiration of the very eager bodhisattva” refers to the wish tofirst attain enlightenment, then to later liberate beings, similar to the wishto gain a ruler’s dominion, then to bring happiness to your subjects. A numberof discourses call this “the inspiration like the exalted Bodhisattva LovingKindness.” For such bodhisattvas of an inferior degree of acumen, the attainmentof enlightenment requires thirty-three incalculable eons—three eons for thepaths of cultivation and application, and three each for each of awakening’s tenstages.The wish to become liberated at the same time as beings is called “theinspiration of sacred wisdom.” This can be likened to the wish of a ferryboatcaptain to cross a river together with passengers. For these bodhisattvas of amiddle degree of spiritual acumen, enlightenment requires seven incalculableeons—two for each of the paths of cultivation and application, one for the pathof seeing, and two for the path of meditation.The wish to liberate sentient beings first, before your own primordialself-liberation, is known as “incomparable inspiration.” This attitude, likethat of shepherds of goats, sheep, or cattle, who watch for dangerous places,such as ravines, and who allow other beings to precede them as they go, withoutletting any fall behind, is the intention to attain awakening for others’ goodlike that of Bodhisattva Gentle Splendor and Buddha Shakyamuni. For suchbodhisattvas of an acute degree of acumen, enlightenment requires threeincalculable eons—from the path of cultivation until the first stage ofawakening takes one great incalculable eon; from the second to the seventhstages, one incalculable eon; and from the eighth until enlightenment, one:three in all.Fourth, the path of cultivation has five special attributes. The specialantidote, that of revulsion, develops from sight of the shortcomings ofcontaminated composite formations. The special renunciation, that of manifestattachment, develops from sight of the faults of contaminated compositeformations. The special realization develops from the sublime insight gainedfrom hearing of and reflecting upon the two aspects of the nonexistence of aself: this mainly results from an abstract understanding, although at this stagerealization can also be produced by meditation. Fourth, special positivequalities include reaching the path of awakening and the ability of theintellect to rest in meditative states of tranquility and insight. It is saidthat these positive qualities lead to such attainments as spiritual sight andclairvoyance, and to hearing profound instruction from the manifest body ofBuddha.The special meditation instructions of the path of cultivation have two parts,general and specific. First, general meditations for all three levels of thepath of cultivation include ethical conduct, focused on physical and verbal actsto be undertaken or abjured; sublime insight gained in hearing the meaning ofthe words of the Buddha’s supreme speech, and reflecting and meditating upon it;the four seals of spiritual instructions; the five powers concordant withfreedom; and recollection of the Buddha, the doctrine, the spiritual community,ethical conduct, giving, the body, death, birth, and the inward and outwardmovement of the breath; recollection of death; and meditation on the eightthoughts of great persons and on completely pure conduct. The nine perceptionsof impurity are meditations on the perception of a corpse’s inert form, itsdestruction by insects, its red color, blue color, black color, consumption byanimals, scattering, burning, and rotting.Second, specific meditation instructions have three parts. On the lesser path ofcultivation, you meditate on the four recollections. That is, duringrecollection of the body, in periods of settling in evenness, you meditate onthe body like space; and in your postmeditative state, on the body as impure,like a magical display, and so on. During recollection of sensation, in periodsof settling in evenness, you meditate on sensation as not coming into being; andin your postmeditative state, on any sensation as suffering and without a solidcore, like a plantain plant. During recollection of mind, in periods of settlingin evenness, you meditate on the mind as intrinsically empty; and in yourpostmeditative state, as unceasing and not abiding. During recollection ofphenomena, in periods of settling in evenness, you meditate on their equanimity;and in your postmeditative state, on the eight metaphors for illusion, and soon.Second, on the middle path of cultivation, you meditate on the four genuinerenunciations: to not develop corrupting qualities that have not yet arisen, tostem those which have, to develop ennobling qualities that have not yet arisen,and to increase those which have. These are effected by diligence and meditationon such antidotes as the nonexistence of an intrinsic self, illusion, or dream.Third, on the higher path of cultivation, you meditate on the four supports formiraculous power. Through meditation on single-minded meditative states thatintegrate tranquility and insight, you accomplish your desired goals, such asspiritual sight, clairvoyance, and miraculous powers. In this case, sincemiraculous powers, and so on, are accomplished through the strength of themind’s pliability gained in meditative stability, these meditativestates—intent, diligence, mind, and examination—are called the four supports formiraculous powers. In these meditations, you first gather your attention on asingle focus and rest in clarity. At that time, if discursive thoughts appear,you immediately prevent their spread, and gather your attention single-mindedlyon the support that provides a focus for the meditation. You meditate repeatedlyin this manner.Second, the explanation of the path of application has two parts: the path ofapplication’s support and its nature. The support (that is, the kind of beingwho can enter this path) can be either a physical support—any being of the fiverealms; or a mental support—any being of the six states of meditative stabilityin the heavens.The nature of the path of application has three parts: its cause, result, andessence. The path of application’s cause is the great way path of cultivation;its three results are the paths of seeing, meditation, and of no furthertraining. The path of application’s essence has four parts: characteristic,example, levels, and special attributes.The path of application’s characteristic is ennobling acts that belong to thegreat way performed after completion of the path of cultivation and until thepath of seeing.Acts that can be appropriately designated as the great way path of applicationare illustrated by any ennobling act of the great way, done after the path ofcultivation has been completed, that causes the first instant of the path ofseeing to arise in an individual’s conscious stream of being.The path of application has four levels: heat, peak, forbearance, and sublimequalities. At the levels of heat and peak, you meditate on the five powers; atthe levels of forbearance and sublime qualities, on the five forces. The fivepowers are faith, diligence, mindfulness, meditative states, and sublimeinsight.You meditate on them as follows: after having uplifted your mind to awakening,you meditate with faithful trust on the meaning of the four truths (impermanenceand so on) or on the knowledge that all phenomena of the round of rebirth andtranscendent states constitute the two truths. You meditate with the enthusiasmof diligence; mindfully not forgetting your understanding; single-minded inmeditative states; and with comprehension of the intrinsic nature of realitythrough sublime insight. Since these five produce complete awakening, they arecalled powers.The five forces are the force of faith, and so on, meditated upon in the samefashion as the powers. Since they overcome influences detrimental to awakening,they are called forces.The essence of wisdom on the path of application’s four levels is, duringsettling in evenness, nonconceptual wisdom. Upon arising from this, yourpostmeditative state can be conceptual or not, as appropriate. These fourwisdoms applied respectively to the lesser, middle, and higher levels of thepath of application are called “the twelve distinct phases that border the pathof seeing.”The stages of wisdom on the path of application are as follows. In the stage ofheat, the attainment of light, phenomena are seen to be simply mind’s externallyappearing appearance. This is wisdom produced by mundane meditation. A slightattainment of light corrects clinging to phenomena as real. Second, in the peakstage, the spreading of light, in order to increase the appearance of thesepositive qualities, you diligently meditate on the nonexistence of the self,which leads to the attainment of a middle degree of light produced throughmundane meditation. Third, in the forbearance stage, to have entered only onefacet of suchness is the attainment of the highest degree of light, producedthrough mundane meditation focused in the mind alone. This corrects attachmentto external phenomena as real. Fourth, the stage of sublime qualities(immediately followed by the path of seeing) is the consummate degree of lightproduced through mundane meditation, without the distraction of clinging toexternal phenomena. At this point, nothing interrupts the attainment of thegreat way’s path of seeing.Of these four, heat and peak constitute the lesser path of application; on theselevels, the time the path of seeing will arise is indefinite. Forbearance is themiddle level—at this point on the path of application, the path of seeing willdefinitely arise, during your next life. Sublime qualities is the higherlevel—at this point on the path of application, the path of seeing will ariseduring your very lifetime.Fourth, the path of application has five special attributes: antidote,renunciation, realization, positive qualities, and superiority to the path ofcultivation. The antidote is renunciation by suppression. In general there arefour antidotes: revulsion, renunciation, support, and distance. The specialrenunciation is decline of the seeds of the obscurations and theirmanifestations; and liberation from the spiritual poverty and decline ofordinary individuals. The special realization is that of the two facets of thenonexistence of a self, attained through wisdom arisen in meditation. Thespecial qualities are possession of various positive qualities, such asmeditative states, spiritual sight, clairvoyance, and miraculous power. Thispath’s superiority to the path of cultivation is that, although this pathresembles the higher path of cultivation in regard to the wisdom produced inmeditation, it is superior to the path of cultivation due to its proximity tothe path of seeing and the comparative stability of the intensity of its wisdom.Third, the explanation of the path of seeing has two parts: support and nature.The support can be either a physical support, any being of the five realms; or amental support, any being in the heavens of the four levels of meditativestability.The path of seeing’s nature has three parts: cause, result, and essence. Thecauses of the path of seeing are the great way paths of cultivation andapplication; its results are the path of meditation and the path of no furthertraining.The path of seeing’s essence has four parts: characteristics, examples,classifications, and special attributes. The great way path of seeing’scharacteristics are forbearance of phenomena, knowledge of them, subsequentforbearance, and subsequent knowledge (along with subjects attendant to each).Acts that can be appropriately designated as the great way path of seeing areillustrated by any ennobling act of the great way, done after the path ofapplication has been completed, that causes the first instant of thetranscendent path of meditation to arise in an individual’s conscious stream ofbeing.The example of the path of seeing is the sixteen instants and related subjects.Each of the four truths—suffering, the source of suffering, cessation, and thespiritual path—has four instants: forbearance of the knowledge of phenomena,knowledge of phenomena, forbearance of subsequent knowledge, and subsequentknowledge.Alternatively, if the example is given in relation to the stages of awakening,the path of seeing corresponds to the first, Intense Joy. The moment of theinitial attainment of transcendent wisdom is preceded by exceptional joy, whichproduces that exalted attainment; thus it is called Intense Joy. As it is saidthat one thereby attains the “dustless spiritual eyes” with which to see allphenomena, this marks the attainment of the path of seeing.Third, the classification follows the order of the four truths, thus has thenature of the sixteen instants. Meditation is on the seven aspects of awakening:When there is no conscious recollection nor any mental effort, theinsubstantiality of all phenomena is seen; this is the aspect of awakening ofcorrect mindfulness. When ennobling acts, corrupting acts, and neutral acts areentirely unproduced, all phenomena dwell apart from notions of an existent self,with nothing to focus upon; this is the aspect of awakening of correctdiscernment of phenomena. When perception of the body is destroyed, and youneither adopt nor reject the three realms, this is the aspect of awakening ofcorrect diligence. When joy and its opposite are destroyed, and joy is notengendered toward any mental formation, this is the aspect of awakening ofcorrect joy. When no focus is brought to a material substance of focus, the mindbecomes well trained in all phenomena, the aspect of awakening of correctthorough training. When the complete destruction of phenomena is subsequentlyexamined, this nonconceptual mind is the aspect of awakening of the correctmeditative state. When you do not abide in, reinforce, attach yourself to, orcling to phenomena, you are endowed with the equanimity of correct nonsight ofphenomena, and thus gain joy; this is the aspect of awakening of correctequanimity.Fourth, the path of seeing has five special attributes: antidote, renunciation,time, realization, and positive qualities. First, the special antidotes: thefour instants of forbearance of phenomena comprise the antidote of renunciation,called the path without interruption, which completely uproots the seeds of whatis renounced on the path of seeing. The four instants of knowledge of phenomenacomprise the antidote of the support, called the path of complete liberation.The four instants of subsequent forbearance and the four subsequent knowledgecomprise the indirect antidote, called the special path.The four instants of knowledge of phenomena—knowledge of the phenomena ofsuffering, of their origin, of their cessation, and of the spiritualpath—concern the essence of a single mental substance, divided into four inrelation to the four truths. The stages of subsequent forbearance and subsequentknowledge follow a similar pattern.Second, the special renunciation has two parts: essence and enumeration. First,the essence of the special renunciation on the path of seeing is liberation fromthe two obscurations—mental afflictions and cognitive obscurations—relinquishedon the path of seeing. The obscuration of mental afflictions, such as greed, canbe defined as the essence of corrupting acts that intensely disturb the mind oras the essence of obscuring acts of undetermined value. Cognitive obscurations,the subject-object experience of dualistic thoughts, can be defined as theessence of contaminated ennobling acts or of nonobscuring acts of undeterminedvalue performed with continual clinging to the reality of the three spheres ofagent, act, and object. Among these, conceptual obscurations of mentalafflictions are renounced on the path of seeing; those which are innate arerenounced on the path of meditation. Coarse dualistic thoughts related tocognitive obscurations are renounced on the path of seeing; subtle ones, on thepath of meditation.Second, the enumeration of the obscurations renounced on the path of seeing hasthree parts: characteristics, classifications, and ways of renunciation. First,these obscurations’ characteristic is any conceptualization that impedes thepath of seeing.Second, the classification of these obscurations has three parts, according toessence, misunderstandings, and realms and misleading influences. If classifiedaccording to their essence, six obscurations are renounced on the path ofseeing: desire, anger, pride, ignorance, views, and doubt. If classifiedaccording to misleading influence, ten obscurations are renounced on the path ofseeing: five views—the view that considers impermanent collections of phenomenato constitute a self, the view that clings to extremes, wrong views, the viewthat clings to any view as supreme, the view that clings to ethical conduct anddiscipline as supreme—and five nonviews—desire, anger, pride, ignorance, anddoubt. If classified according to specific realms and misleading influences, onehundred and twelve aspects of obscurations are renounced on the path of seeing:When the five views are applied to the four truths (such as the truth ofsuffering, and the others, in the desire realm) and the five nonviews arelikewise applied to each of the four truths, each truth has ten, a total offorty. Likewise, when they are applied to the four truths in the two higherrealms of form and formlessness, nine aspects of obscurations (anger isexcluded) are renounced in each realm. Thus, for the four heavens of meditativestability, there is a total of thirty-six. The five views and four nonviewsapplied to the formless heavens’ four truths give another thirty-six, a total ofone hundred and twelve.Third, how obscurations are renounced on the path of seeing is as follows. Onthe distinct levels of the path of application that border the path of seeing,the seeds of the obscurations are suppressed, whereas at the instants offorbearance of knowledge of phenomena, and so on (that is, on the path of seeingitself), they are uprooted.Forbearance produced by knowledge of phenomena of the four truths (the actualcause), converges with the seeds of what is renounced on the path of seeing (theperpetuating cause). The actual cause acts as a coincident condition that stemsthe continuity of the seeds at the same time as forbearance of phenomena arises.Since the seeds of what is renounced are destroyed in the first instant, nofurther destroying factor is necessary. Therefore, in the second instant, at theknowledge of phenomena, you attain direct liberation from the seeds of what isrenounced on the path of seeing.The four instants of subsequent forbearance and four subsequent knowledge ariseafter the path of seeing’s two previous aspects of wisdom, which are antidotesfor the extremely subtle obscurations renounced at each stage; these two aspectsof wisdom that liberate from the seeds of what is renounced constitute distantantidotes. From the perspective of the instants of each of the four truths andwhat is renounced at each, they act as antidotes that progressively exhaust thedefilements. From the perspective of the arising of wisdom, when the forbearanceof phenomena appears at the path without interruption and the path of completeliberation, what was not seen is seen; thus, it is called the path of seeing.When powerful obscurations to be renounced on these stages encounter wisdom’songoing cause, they are suppressed; when those which are not powerful meetwisdom’s actual cause, they decline. At the same moment that actual wisdomarises, what is renounced ceases, along with its seeds. Additional wisdomdistances you from what is to be renounced, and thus acts as the antidote thatsets in motion the path of complete liberation.Third, the special time is explained as follows. At the beginning, the fourinstants of forbearance of phenomena related to the four truths arisesimultaneously. Then, the four instants of knowledge of phenomena arisesimultaneously. Then, the four instants of subsequent forbearance arisesimultaneously, followed by the four instants of subsequent knowledge, whicharise simultaneously. Thus, the four instants of completed action arise as anessence, the four divisions (that is, the four truths) that have sixteenaspects, since the four truths are realized together, whereas the four instantsof forbearance and knowledge arise sequentially.Fourth, the path of seeing’s special realization is transcendent sublime insightthat directly realizes the two aspects of the nonexistence of a self. Moreover,since the basic space of phenomena pervades self and other equally, this specialrealization leads to the realization of awakened mind in which self and otherare equal.Fifth, the path of seeing’s special qualities are that, in one instant, you havethe capability to display twelve positive qualities, each to the power of onehundred, and you have such inconceivable positive qualities as spiritual sight,clairvoyance, and miraculous power. These include the following: in one instant,you see one hundred buddhas; you receive one hundred buddhas’ blessings; you goto one hundred pure lands; you can make one instant last one hundred eons; yourwisdom can span one hundred lifetimes, those of past or future; you enter intoand arise from one hundred meditative states; you bring one hundred beings tospiritual maturity; you move one hundred realms; you illuminate one hundredrealms; you open one hundred gates to spiritual instruction; you show onehundred of your own forms; and each of your forms teaches a magnificententourage of one hundred disciples.The fault of greed is purified and the transcendent perfection of generosity iscompleted. At the first stage of awakening, Intense Joy, you can take birth asruler of this world.Fourth, this section has two parts. First, the path of meditation has two parts:support and nature. The physical support for the arising of the path ofmeditation (that is, the kind of being who can enter this path) is mainly birthas a man or woman of the three of the four human continents, or as a god of thedesire or form realms. The mental support is four levels of meditativestability.The nature of the path of meditation has three parts: cause, result, andessence. The cause of the path of meditation is the first three paths of thegreat way; its result is the path of no further training.The path of meditation’s essence has two parts: its characteristic and itsexample. The path of meditation’s characteristic is the example of the great waypath including everything between awakening’s second stage until the stage ofculmination. Acts called the great way path of meditation are illustrated by anyennobling act done after the completion of the path of seeing, which causes thefirst instant of the path of no further training to arise in an individual’sconscious stream of being. The example is ennobling acts that belong to thenature of awakening’s ten stages.Second, this section has four parts. First, in the path of meditation’sclassification, its lesser, middle, and higher paths are each divided intothree. These are the nine stages of awakening of the path of meditation: (1) Thefirst stage of awakening, on the path of seeing, is Intense Joy; (2) the lesserpath of meditation is the second stage of awakening, Immaculate; (3) the middlelesser, the third stage, Illuminating; (4) the higher lesser, the fourth stage,Radiant; (5) the lesser middle path is the fifth stage, Difficult to Refine; (6)the middle middle, the sixth stage, Manifest; (7) the higher middle, the seventhstage, Far-Reaching; (8) lesser higher is the eighth, Unmoving; (9) the middlehigher, the ninth stage, Excellent Intelligence; and (10) the higher higher, thetenth stage, Cloud of the Doctrine.The ten transcendent perfections are completed on these stages: generosity atthe first stage of awakening, as explained above, ethical conduct at the second,patience at the third, diligence at the fourth, meditative stability at thefifth, sublime insight at the sixth, skillful means at the seventh, force at theeighth, aspiration at the ninth, and wisdom at the tenth. The ten thingsrenounced are greed at the first stage of awakening as explained above,unethical conduct at the second, anger at the third, laziness at the fourth,distraction at the fifth, incorrect understanding at the sixth, unskillful actsat the seventh, obscured force at the eighth, unfulfilled aspirations at theninth, and cognitive obscurations at the tenth.Second, this section has five parts. First, the special antidotes on the path ofmeditation are explained as follows. From the perspective of renunciation ofdefilements on awakening’s nine stages, the path of meditation’s path ofapplication and its path without interruption are antidotes based onrenunciation; its path of complete liberation constitutes the antidote based onsupport; and its special path constitutes the antidote based on distance.For an ordinary individual, before a stage of awakening is reached, the path ofmeditation’s path of application entails the renunciation of coarse obscurationsin order to hinder what must be renounced at that specific stage. At the initialarising of a stage of awakening, the path without interruption entails theactual renunciation of seeds of defilements related to that specific stage. Thepath of complete liberation begins from the second instant of a stage ofawakening and continues during its main part. At the conclusion of a stage,after its special qualities are attained, the special path consists of thecontinuing movement toward a higher stage.The path of meditation’s special renunciations are the thorough rejection ofwhat is renounced on the path of seeing; and, among what is renouncedspecifically on the path of meditation, the rejection of the coarse obscurationsand the beginning of rejection of subtle obscurations. In essence, what isrenounced on the path of meditation are the innate aspects of the obscurationsof mental afflictions and cognitive obscurations.The classification of these renunciations has four parts: classification byessence, realm, stages, and levels. Classified by essence, the obscurations tobe renounced have six aspects—desire, anger, pride, ignorance, the view ofimpermanent phenomena as constituting a self, and the view that clings toextremes.Second, classified by realm, six obscurations are renounced in the desire realmand five each (anger is the missing one of the six) in the upper two realms, atotal of sixteen. Third, classified by stages, in the desire realm there aresix; on the four levels of meditative stability, four groups of five; on thefour levels of formlessness, four groups of five—a total of forty-six.Fourth, if classified by levels and categories of greater and middle degrees ofobscurations, on nine levels (a number that refers in this case to the desirerealm; the first, second, third, and fourth levels of meditative stability; andthe levels of the formless realm—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingwhatsoever, and pinnacle of existence), each of the nine kinds of greater andmiddle degrees of desire yields eighty-one. Likewise, nine sets of nine kinds ofpride, nine kinds of ignorance, nine kinds of view of impermanent phenomena asconstituting a self, and nine kinds of extreme views—five times eighty-one—atotal of four hundred and five, to which the middle degree of anger of thedesire realm must be added, a grand total of four hundred and fourteen. Theseare renounced on each of the path of meditation’s four levels—application,without interruption, complete liberation, and special.Third, the special realizations are as follows. At awakening’s first stage, theessence of the mind’s nature, luminosity, is realized to pervade all beings.This marks the realization of awakened mind’s evenness of self and others. Atthe second stage, that essence is understood as supreme among realizations: youdevelop diligence in cleansing the impurities that cover your innate constituentenlightenment. At the third stage, with the realization that hearing theteachings is of a similar substance to the basic space of phenomena, to listento the teachings you would cross the cosmos even if it consisted of a solid massof fire. At the fourth stage, you realize that in basic space there is noclinging to a sense of self, and you relinquish attachment to phenomena.At the fifth stage, you realize that the innate constituent enlightenmentpresent within the mind of yourself and others is not separate and thus realizeevenness in the ten pure thoughts of all buddhas. The ten pure thoughts arepositive qualities counted as three, training counted as three, the spiritualpath, knowledge of what is not the path, the thirty-seven facets of awakening,and spiritual maturation of sentient beings (three each—with body, speech, andmind—are counted for the first two).At the sixth stage, you realize the natural purity of the innate constituentenlightenment: you entirely reverse clinging to acceptance or rejection of theround of rebirth and transcendent states. At the seventh stage, you realize thenonseparateness of the innate constituent enlightenment: you reverse allclinging to traits as existent. At the eighth stage, you realize that the faultsor positive qualities of that very essence neither diminish nor increase: yoursupreme forbearance toward the unborn nature of phenomena becomes extremelypure. At the ninth stage, you realize that the innate constituent enlightenmentinherently possesses four aspects of awareness: you gain mastery of wisdom. Atthe tenth stage, you realize that the innate constituent enlightenment is itselfa source of magnificent enlightened activity: you attain mastery of the fourpowers. The four powers are mastery of nondiscursiveness, mastery of pure lands,mastery of the four aspects of individual genuine awareness, and mastery ofenlightened activity.Fourth, the path of meditation’s special qualities are explained as follows. Atawakening’s second stage, the positive qualities of awakening’s first stage(mentioned above as the path of seeing’s special qualities, the twelve positivequalities times one hundred) are the same twelve positive qualities times onethousand; at the third stage, twelve times one hundred thousand; at the fourthstage, twelve times ten million; at the fifth stage, twelve times one thousandten million; at the sixth stage, twelve times one hundred thousand ten million;at the seventh stage, twelve times one hundred thousand million times tenmillion; at the eighth stage, twelve times a number equal to the atoms in onehundred thousand cosmos; at the ninth stage, twelve times a number equal to theatoms in one hundred thousand incalculable cosmos; and at the tenth stage, youhave the power to make manifest in each instant the twelve positive qualities,such as seeing buddhas, equal to the number of infinitesimal particles ofinexpressibly numerous atoms of inexpressibly numerous pure lands of thebuddhas.Fifth, the special assumed forms are as follows: at the second stage ofawakening, you take birth as the universal monarch of the four continents; atthe third, as Shakra; at the fourth, as the ruler of the Sumaya gods; at thefifth, as the ruler of Joyful Heaven; at the sixth, as ruler of the Heaven ofJoy in Creation; at the seventh, as ruler of the Heaven of Control of Others’Creations; at the eighth, as Brahma, the general chief of a simple cosmos; atthe ninth, as Great Brahma, chief of a middle, double cosmos; and at the tenth,as Great Vishnu, chief of a great, triple cosmos.Third, at the tenth stage of awakening, the eightfold exalted path is describedas follows. To see all phenomena as nondual, without unevenness among them, isto have the correct view. To “not see” phenomena, to see them without analysis,to see them with a complete lack of analysis, and to see them with a total lackof analysis, is to have correct thought. To see the inexpressible nature of allphenomena is to have correct speech. To see the lack of function and theinactive nature of all phenomena is to have correct action. To see all phenomenato be without increase or diminishment is to have correct livelihood. Tocompletely accomplish all phenomena by seeing all phenomena to be without effortand accomplishment is to have correct effort. To see all phenomena to be withoutmental activity and without recollection is to have correct mindfulness. Sincephenomena are without reference points, to see no reference point and settle inevenness naturally unperturbed is to have correct meditative states.These are the eight branches of the exalted path.Fourth, the tenth-stage bodhisattvas at the point of culmination make offeringsto all victors of the ten directions. From every victor’s forehead, theempowerment of supreme luminosity shines forth and dissolves into the crowns ofthe bodhisattvas’ heads. They attain vajra-like and other meditative states,numbering incalculable hundred thousands. These put an end to their subtlecognitive obscurations: the qualities of their innate constituent enlightenmentmanifest and they definitely attain the state of enlightenment.This concludes the commentary to “The Path of the Middle Way,” Book 9 of TheInvaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a work that elucidatesall ways of spiritual development.BOOK 10: THE RESULT OF THE MIDDLE WAYBook 10, “The Result of the Middle Way,” has three chapters: “A BriefPresentation of the Support and Nature of the Path of No Further Training”; “AnExtensive Explanation of the Path of No Further Training”; and “A DetailedPresentation of Special Characteristics of the Path of No Further Training.”Chapter 1: Upon reaching the end of training in and traversing the paths andstages of awakening, and the twofold cultivation, as described, the path of nofurther training is reached. This presentation of the path of no furthertraining has two parts: support and nature.There are two supports (that is, the kind of being who can enter this path). Thecommon Buddhist perspective is a belief that the physical support that leads toenlightenment is life as a human being among the royalty or the brahmin caste inthe Land of Jambu. Nevertheless, the special perspective is a belief that thephysical support for this path is life as any being who attains enlightenment inthe Highest Pure Land, after which an emanation of that individual appears inthe realms of beings, in whatever support is appropriate to lead them toenlightenment. The mental support for this path is the fourth level ofmeditative stability.Second, the nature of the path of no further training has three parts: cause,result, and essence. The cause of the path of no further training is completionof the twofold cultivation of goodness and wisdom along the four paths oftraining. Its result is the magnificent activity of enlightenment, which placesall beings in the three states of awakening.The essence of the path of no further training has two parts: itscharacteristics and examples. The characteristics of the path of no furthertraining are the ennobling acts of perfect renunciation and realization asdefined by the great way; for example, it is correct to designate the threebodies of enlightenment with their wisdoms as the great way’s path of no furthertraining. Examples include the body of ultimate enlightenment’s ten positivequalities of no further training, five uncontaminated psychophysicalaggregations, and six transcendent perfections.Chapter 2 has three parts. First, this section has three parts. First, the emptybasic space of phenomena, which forms the true nature of enlightenment’s bodies,is called “the essential wisdom body, the nature of reality, supreme purity andevenness.” The essence of awareness, the wisdom of consummate renunciation andrealization, has twenty-one groups of qualities: this realization of the body ofultimate enlightenment’s wisdom makes manifest the qualities of innateconstituent enlightenment.The twenty-one groups of qualities are as follows. (1) The thirty-seven facetsof awakening are four foundations for mindfulness, four correct renunciations,four supports for miraculous powers, five powers, five forces, seven aspects ofawakening, and the eightfold exalted path.(2) The four immeasurable aspirations are love, compassion, sympathetic joy, andequanimity.(3) The eight forms of freedom are as follows: The freedom of an embodied beingseeing form; the freedom of a formless being seeing form; the freedom of removalof hindrances of beauty; the freedom of the four stages of composure: boundlessspace, boundless consciousness, nothingness, and not perception and notnonperception; and the freedom of cessation.(4) The nine forms of meditative composure are to enter composure in the fourlevels of meditative stability, the four levels of formlessness, and cessation.(5) The ten unlimited spheres of meditative control are as follows: earth,water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, white, space, and consciousness.(6) The eight overpowering spheres of meditative control are as follows. Thosewho have a personal form can see small external forms and overpower them. Thosewho have a personal form can see large external forms and overpower them. Thosewithout form can see small or large forms and overpower them. Those without apersonal form can, through perception alone, overpower then see blue, yellow,red, and white.(7) To destroy mental afflictions is to relieve them from others’ streams ofbeing. (8) To know former aspirations is to have whatever is done be producedspontaneously. (9) The six forms of clairvoyance are as follows: miracles,divine hearing, knowledge of others’ thoughts, recollection of past existences,divine sight, and the cessation of contamination.(10) The four modes of correct discerning awareness are those of phenomena,meaning, definitions, and confidence. (11) The four purities are complete purityof the support, intention, wisdom mind, and wisdom. (12) The ten powers arepower over longevity, mind, necessities, action, birth, intent, aspiration,miracles, wisdom, and instruction.(13) The ten forces are knowledge of positive or negative fields of action,maturation of deeds, various interests, various faculties, supreme andnonsupreme acumen, the paths to every destination, completely obscuring mentalafflictions and their purification, recollection of previous places and times,death and birth, and the cessation of contamination.(14) The four forms of fearlessness are fearlessness toward magnificentrealization, impediments to the teaching of spiritual instructions, showing thepath of disengagement, and magnificent renunciation. (15) The three kinds ofunguardedness are no thought of concealing wrongdoing, due to holy conduct ofbody, speech, and mind. (16) The three kinds of mindfulness are to remain inequanimity, detached from attachment, anger, or indifference toward respectivelythose who want to listen to spiritual instructions, those who do not, and thosewho have both feelings. (17) No lapse means no lapse in service to sentientbeings. (18) To have overcome all habitual patterns is to have defeated alldefiled habitual patterns. (19) Supreme nondual compassion is the motivation ofsupreme, altruistic nondual compassion toward all beings.(20) The Buddha’s eighteen unique qualities are in three groups of six. Thefirst six are the following: buddhas do not make mistakes in physical conduct,they have no faults in speech, no lapses in memory, no gap in settling inevenness, no perception of duality, no nondiscerning equanimity. The second sixare the following: buddhas are not subject to failure in intention, diligence,recollection, meditative states, sublime insight, and complete liberation. Thethird six are the following: buddhas’ acts of wisdom body, speech, mind arepreceded and followed by wisdom. Their wisdom without impediment comprehends thethree times—past, present, and future.(21) The three forms of knowledge are omniscience itself, knowledge of the path,and knowledge of every basis.Second, the body of enlightenment’s perfect rapture possesses the fivecertainties: In the certain abode, the Highest Pure Land of Dense Array, thecertain teacher—the five chiefs, such as Buddha Illuminator, of the five wisdomclans—display the beautiful signs and marks of the body of enlightenment’sperfect rapture. The thirty-two excellent signs are (1) beautiful wheel designson the soles and palms, (2) flat and full soles, (3) webbed fingers and toes,(4) long and narrow fingers, (5) round and full heels, (6) soft and supple handsand feet, (7) inconspicuous ankles, (8) antelope-like calves, (9) genitalsretracted and covered, (10) long arms so that his fingertips reach the knees,(11) gold-colored body, (12) body hair curls upward, (13) each strand curlsclockwise, (14) soft skin with no smell of perspiration, (15) fullness in sevenplaces, (16) well-rounded forearms and biceps, (17) a lionlike torso, (18) alarge and straight body, (19) symmetrical like a banyan tree, (20) a lionlikejaw, (21) white teeth, (22) even teeth, equal in size, (23) a complete set offorty teeth, (24) a long, wide tongue, (25) a tongue that finds everythingdelicious, (26) full and even collar-bone, (27) radiance that extends one armspan, (28) deep blue eyes, (29) eyelashes like the finest cow, (30) the melodicvoice of Brahma, (31) a beautiful protuberance on the crown, and (32) a curl ofhair between the eyebrows.The eighty excellent marks are as follows. This is the first set of ten: (1)fingernails copper-colored, pink, (2) shiny, (3) high in the middle, withoutdepressions, (4) round and full fingers, (5) wide in span, (6) and tapered, (7)inconspicuous veins, (8) that have no knots, (9) inconspicuous ankles, (10) evenfeet, not of different sizes.This is the second set of ten: (11) He moves with a lion’s gait, (12) anelephant’s gait, (13) a swan’s gait, (14) a buffalo’s gait, (15) a gait tendingto the right, (16) an elegant gait, (17) an erect gait, (18) a graceful gait,(19) his body appears as if polished, (20) he is well-proportioned.This is the third set of ten: (21) His body is clean, (22) soft, (23) pure, (24)his genitals are fully developed, (25) he has an expansive bearing, (26) an evenstep, (27) clear eyes, (28) he is youthful, (29) not stooped, (30) full-bodied.This is the fourth set of ten: (31) His body is solid, (32) limbs, fingers, andtoes well defined, (33) clear vision, (34) he has a round waist, (35) a taperedwaist, (36) his belly is not long, (37) does not bulge and is not uneven, (38)his navel is deep, swirling, (39) his behavior is attractive, (40) he is pure inconduct.This is the fifth set of ten: (41) He has no moles or discolorations on hisskin, (42) soft hands, (43) clear lines on the palms, (44) deep lines, sincethey are visible from a distance, (45) long lines, (46) his face is not toolong, (47) he has red lips, (48) long, soft tongue, (49) fine tongue, (50) redtongue.This is the sixth set of ten: (51) He has a thunderous voice, (52) a pleasingand gentle voice, (53) rounded teeth, (54) sharp teeth, (55) white teeth, (56)even teeth, (57) gradually tapering teeth, (58) a high nose, (59) pure and cleannose, (60) wide eyes.This is the seventh set of ten: (61) He has thick eyelashes, (62) the white andblack of his eyes are distinct, like lotus petals, (63) he has long eyebrows,(64) soft eyebrows, (65) shiny eyebrows, (66) his eyebrows’ hair is of evenlength, (67) his arms are long and broad, (68) he has symmetrical ears, (69) nodeficiency in the sense of hearing, (70) a well-formed forehead.This is the eighth set of ten: (71) He has a broad forehead, (72) a large head,like a parasol, (73) hair black as bees, (74) thick hair, without bald spots,(75) soft, (76) untangled, (77) not unkempt, (78) fragrant hair, (79) a knot ofeternity at the heart, (80) emblems on the palms and soles.The five certainties of the form of the perfect rapture of enlightenment alsoinclude the certain entourage, an entourage of bodhisattvas who have reached thetenth stage of awakening; the certain doctrine, exclusively the teaching of thegreat way; and the certain time, permanent, continual time.Third, among the different forms of the manifest body of enlightenment, createdmanifest bodies of enlightenment include sacred representations, such asstatues, paintings, texts, and religious monuments. Incarnate forms ofenlightenment manifest as beings appear in various forms—such as kings,government officials, men, and women—to guide others in appropriate ways.Supreme manifest bodies of enlightenment display the twelve acts of the buddhasin the world: (1) descent from Joyous Heaven after having seen the place, time,social class, father, and mother of his rebirth; (2) entering the womb, havingmanifested as a light ash-colored elephant; (3) birth in Lumbini Garden, fromhis mother’s right side, and acceptance of the name Sarvatasiddha; (4) educationin skills, such as literature, archery, and gymnastics; (5) life with a circleof queens, including Gopa and Yashodhara; (6) disenchantment from having seenbirth, aging, sickness, and death, and renunciation of home life on arriving atthe religious monument called the Pure; (7) ascetic practice for six years onthe banks of the Nairanjana River; (8) proceeding to awakening by sitting onkusha grass at Vajra Seat and the vow to not move; (9) defeat of the demons’armies by transforming the demons’ weapons into an offering of flowers; (10)entering the vajra-like meditative state and, at dawn, the achievement ofcomplete enlightenment; (11) turning the wheel of the three levels of thedoctrine—the four noble truths, absence of self-existent characteristics, andultimate definitive meaning; and (12) at the age of eighty-two, in the villageof Kushinagar, demonstrating the transcendence of sorrow.Second, this section has three parts. First, the content of enlightenment,wisdom, is twofold—knowledge of the nature of the basic space of phenomena, freefrom the extremes of formulation of objects of knowledge; and precise knowledgeof the multiplicity of phenomena in the round of rebirth and transcendentstates. The basis of the classification is the wisdom of enlightenment; thecategories are knowledge of the nature of reality and of multiplicity. Knowledgeof the nature is wisdom of the basic space of phenomena; knowledge ofmultiplicity is the essence and other aspects of four wisdoms—mirrorlike,evenness, discernment, and all-accomplishing.Second, the essence of mirrorlike wisdom has five qualities; its complement isthree other wisdoms; and its function is appearance as the illusory reflectionsof the wisdom body of perfect rapture and the manifest wisdom body.The essence of the wisdom of evenness is comprehension of the evenness of theround of rebirth and transcendent states; its complement is supreme love andnondual compassion; and its function is manifestation of form bodies in relationto the interests of those to be guided.The essence of the wisdom of discernment is unhindered knowledge of objects ofknowledge; its complements include meditative states and recollection; itsfunction is to produce a rain of teachings.The essence of all-accomplishing wisdom is accomplishment of the manifestationof emanations to serve sentient beings in myriad ways; its function isinconceivable service for beings to be spiritually guided.Third, this section has two parts. First, this section has three parts. First,some middle way philosophers contend that since knowledge is a formulation,enlightenment has no wisdom. Second, some mind only philosophers contend thatknowledge does not include appearances. Third, some materialist philosopherscontend that wisdom directly sees delusion’s perceptions of self-existentphenomena.Second, this section has two parts. First, the correct perspective is asfollows: Since delusion has been purified from enlightened beings’ personalexperience, they do not see actual delusion’s perceptions; however, they knowentirely the causes and results of delusion within others’ experience.It is as if two persons slept in the same place and one woke before the other,became endowed with miraculous power, and could manifest as a spiritual teacherwithin the dream of the still sleeping person. After such instructions, thedreamer could traverse the spiritual path through practice and then awake, atwhich point there would be no difference between the two persons. Similarly,ordinary delusion’s perceptions resemble the example of a dream: the wisdom ofan enlightened being sees this and performs acts as in a dream. Wisdom knows thetrue state of reality, knows directly the illusory nature of objects ofknowledge, and knows the three times simultaneously and without hindrance.Second, although no objects of knowledge exist within the wisdom of the truenature, they lie within the sphere of wisdom’s domain. Although things are notseen as truly existent by the knowledge of multiplicity, wisdom knows them toexist as merely the appearances of a false dream.Third, the deeds, enlightened activity—spontaneous aid for beings in skillful,appropriate ways to guide them—do not fade with time nor disappear for even aninstant until the end of the round of rebirth. These are shown clearly by thefollowing nine examples: the various reflected forms of the Lord of Gods(Indra), a divine drum, a cloud, Brahma, the sun, a precious wish-fulfillingjewel, an echo, space, and the earth.Further, such acts appear to fortunate persons simultaneously, like the sun’sreflection that appears within all containers of water at the same time. TheBuddha teaches disciples according to their karmic perceptions. Those withoutthe karmic connection to the Buddha, like deaf persons who hear no sounds, wouldsee nothing even if the Buddha were to appear directly before them.Chapter 3 has three parts. First, the special renunciation is the purificationof the two obscurations along with their related habitual patterns. Second, thespecial realization is the pure vision of all phenomena.Third, the special qualities are the wheel of inexhaustible adornments ofenlightened body, speech, and mind as described above, among which are the sixtymelodic qualities of the Buddha’s speech: (1) soft, (2) gentle, (3) compelling,(4) agreeable, (5) pure, (6) faultless, (7) completely clear, (8)sweet-sounding, (9) pleasing, (10) calming, (11) worthwhile, (12) unassailable,(13) not harsh, (14) not inflexible, (15) completely restrained, (16) pleasingto the ear, (17) satisfying to the body, (18) satisfying to the mind, (19)gladdening, (20) pleasing, (21) never troubling, (22) to be known thoroughly,(23) to be understood thoroughly, (24) perfectly clear, (25) heartening, (26)exhilarating, (27) comprehensive, (28) informative, (29) coherent, since it doesnot contradict logic, (30) relevant, since it teaches what is right, (31) notrepetitive, (32) forceful like a lion’s roar, (33) like an elephant’strumpeting, (34) like thunder, (35) like the voice of the lord of nagas, (36)like the melodies of the divine musicians, (37) like the voice of the divinebird (kalavingka), (38) like the voice of Brahma, (39) like the chakora bird’ssong, (40) like the lord of the gods’ voice, (41) like a drum, (42) not vain,(43) not degraded, (44) consistent, (45) not deficient, (46) not incomplete,(47) not timid, (48) not weak, (49) completely joyous, (50) encompassing, (51)not rigid, (52) fluent, (53) impressive, (54) grammatically complete, (55)satisfying, (56) irreproachable, (57) reliable, (58) not rushed, (59) resoundingeverywhere, and (60) supreme in every circumstance.This concludes the commentary to the words of “The Result of the Middle Way,”Book 10 of The Invaluable Treasury of Buddhist Discourses and Tantras, a workthat elucidates all ways of spiritual development."},{"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN KEY TO THE CONTENTS: BOOKS 1 TO 25 [05_toc-title.html#head_32]An Index to The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantraimage [images/chapline.jpg]This short work by Choying Tobden Dorje provides a list of the eighty separatetexts that make up his entire work The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra toTantra.

These have been culled from the illustratedversion of his work—they appear at the end of each collection of drawings thataccompany a specific book. Thus, both in their physical placement and in theirtone, they constitute his last words on each major subject.Under each heading below, Choying Tobden Dorje’s words appear first, indented,followed by comments from the translator.INTRODUCTION AND BRIEF PRESENTATIONMost people do not own many books. They might acquire some, but those copies’editions can be marred by errors. Some books might be error-free but the ownersdo not acquire the requisite corresponding empowerments, transmissions, andinstructions. Or, even if they receive the reading transmission for some, theyfind it difficult to curb their scattered attention.Some readers are interested in the subjects of acts, karma, and consequences,and in the monastic code of conduct. Some are interested in the conduct of thevictors and their spiritual heirs (that is, the bodhisattva path). Some areinterested in the rapid path of tantra. Some are interested in various aspectsof Buddhist culture. Some are interested in teaching the terms used to presentinformation in texts. Some are interested in the profound meanings of the keyinstructions for experiential cultivation. Some are interested in extensivecollections of profound meaning. Some are interested in excellent texts ofextensive definitive instructions. For readers of these and other variedinterests, I have composed this work in which all these subjects are complete.I, Choying Tobden Dorje, wrote this as a means to turn the reader’s mind to allthe Buddhist canon’s discourses, tantras, and treatises.THESE CONCLUDING REMARKS are quite short compared to those he makes at the endof the following books. Choying Tobden Dorje makes two major points here. Thefirst concerns the sorry state of book publishing and readership in Tibet. Inmodern countries, we are startled when we find even a single spelling mistake ina published book: for this we must thank the practically invisible guild ofeagle-eyed editors and copy editors. Should these individuals want to continuethat work in their next lifetime, they might consider rebirth in Tibetanregions: they’re sorely needed.Yet even if a Tibetan Buddhist book comes into our hands error-free, it isincumbent on us as readers to ensure that the book corresponds to our activespiritual life. One high Tibetan lama complained aloud in my hearing that he’dbeen in a bad mood that day and wanted “to read like Westerners do—just to readsomething I hadn’t read before.” Normally, he maintained a strict, traditionaldiscipline in relation to the reading of Buddhist books. Each work he opened hada context, the same one that Choying Tobden Dorje laments the general readershipdisregards: a spiritual ecosystem in which books constitute but a single part ina much larger whole. Tibet did not have a system of legal copyright; what it didhave was a tacit understanding, articulated above, that sacred books belongwithin a process that includes empowerment, reading transmission, andinstruction. Ideally, Buddhist readers treat their books as we do the myriadmiraculous and powerful substances we refer to as prescription drugs. As vitaland even life-saving as they can be, and as convinced as we might be that we arein need of a specific remedy, we are obliged to first consult with a doctor,receive the drug from a pharmacist, and to ingest it as we’ve been advised. Weusually follow that system not just because there is no legal alternative; itjust seems sensible, especially if we’ve witnessed the results of others’attempts at self-medication. We keep prescription drugs in special cabinets, outof the reach of children and out of the sight of all but those closest to us.Most of us would be hesitant to share any drug with even a familymember—shouldn’t they first consult with their trusted doctor as we did? What isthe best medicine for us could easily prove poisonous to another, so we think.If only we had the exactly same attitude toward sacred texts!For Tibet’s Buddhists, there is a world of difference between books read forentertainment or information, and sacred books. The first is seen as being likean over-the-counter treatment (usually for boredom); the second is regarded aswe do the most powerful life-saving medicine. Each sacred book comes infusedwith the spiritual influence—“blessing”—of the author and the lineage, as wellas the presence of all the wisdom beings in whom we take refuge, including thedakinis and guardians of the doctrine. The Buddha’s doctrine is unfathomablywide and deep, and said to be entirely virtuous in the beginning, middle, andend, yet no Buddhist spiritual practice condones unsupervised reading. Onereader’s meat can be another’s poison, even on elementary levels.What Choying Tobden Dorje has on the menu in The Complete Nyingma Tradition isthe second point of his remarks. In this informal mission statement, he stateshe has written a work in which everyone can find something of interest. Animpartial examination of his long list of book and chapter titles in the briefintroduction confirms that he succeeded in what he set out to accomplish.The format of his long introduction that begins this work is anything butarbitrary: our author conforms to the demands of classical Buddhist literatureas the Tibetans assimilated and reproduced it. Introductions have three parts: adescription of the title, offerings of homage, and a declaration of the author’sresolve to complete the text. Here we are treated to the scenic route to touchthese three inevitable elements that open a Buddhist treatise, yet even at thebeginning of more modest works these same points can be discerned.We find the same heed for past models in the brief presentation, where at theend of his generous description of the work to come, the author citesuniversally known and accepted Buddhist treatises as precedents to validate hisapproach. His care in respecting the past extends beyond the work’s structure tothe content itself. Our author signs this first book adding “Longchen” to hisname: this is a wink to literate Tibetan readers. Choying Tobden Dorje in otherworks adds “Dzokchen” to his name, signaling the author’s sense of identity andthe thrust of the writing in that instance. Here, he openly indicates his debtto Longchenpa (1308–1363), the main source he drew upon in this work. One othercontributor whose writing Choying Tobden Dorje borrowed is Lochen Dharmashri(1654–1718). To describe in detail how these towering Nyingma masters’ writingshave been woven into the fabric of the present work constitutes laudablescholarship but frightful manners. One Tibetan resource person whose tirelesshelp was invaluable for this project named me “the Kenneth Starr oftranslators,” in “honor” of an investigator who toiled doggedly to reveal to thepublic what might have better remained a private matter. The resource personfelt my researching zeal to be equally misplaced.In the context of this book, then, I will not intrude on the private spaceshared between the author, and you, the reader. The author has dropped a broadhint that the inebriating perfume that wafts from the page comes from MaisonLongchenpa. To say more would spoil the mystery and the thrill of yourdiscovery. I’ll leave you two alone.BOOK 1: DISCIPLESHIPThose who speak the truth in keeping with the scriptures of the Buddha’s wordand who in every circumstance are energetic in skillfully leading all beings’minds to the sacred Buddhist doctrine are called spiritual masters or guides,even if they do not have impressive titles, positions, possessions, or clothing.If you correctly rely upon such persons, your mind will turn toward the sacreddoctrine and you will certainly gain lasting happiness. Those whose speech is indiscord with the scriptures of the Buddha’s word and who are energetic inskillfully leading all beings’ minds to negative, corrupting, evil acts relatedto the appearances of this life might succeed in bringing beings immediatehappiness but will eventually guide them to various karmic causes of tremendoussuffering. Even if such persons have impressive titles, positions, possessions,clothing, entourage, and wealth, they are called misleading companions, guideson the path to miserable realms within the round of rebirth. You should avoidthem like poison.Those called spiritual guides are content should food or wealth come their wayand remain content even if they do not. What is really necessary for them isgenuine spiritual practice. Those who use many means to undertake ennobling actsare spiritual guides; those who employ many means to undertake wrongdoing aremisleading companions. Since the result of ennobling acts is happiness, youshould rely upon a spiritual guide however you can. Since wrongdoing’s resultsare suffering, you should forsake misleading companions however you can. Theextent to which you rely upon a spiritual friend is profitable; the extent towhich you rely on a misleading companion entails loss.Positive ennobling acts provide the source of magnificent happiness, bothtemporary and permanent. Since spiritual masters and guides are the source ofennobling acts, you should know them to be the source of happiness. To be happyaccomplishes your personal goal. Vile wrongdoing provides the source ofunwished-for suffering, both temporary and long-term. Since misleadingcompanions are the source of wrongdoing, you should know them to be the sourceof suffering. When you find yourself tormented by various sufferings, you havenot achieved your personal goals.To integrate the sacred Buddhist instructions with your mind, you must gaze atthese drawings and repeatedly bring them to mind. If these become integratedwith your mind, all appearing existence dawns as sacred texts and your own mindwill surely dawn as the spiritual master. Whatever you see or hear should ariseas instructions for the common or extraordinary paths, and should arise asspiritual masters. Since spiritual masters should present the meaning of thesacred doctrine in metaphors, I have put such metaphors into drawings. If youmemorize the words and keep the images firmly in mind, you will have nohesitation in teaching, reflection, or meditation.In drawing these examples, I have drawn various objects, such as mountains,cliffs, forests, lakes, water, fire, wind, space, buildings, and beings.Appearing existence naturally arises without being drawn; thus all appearingexistence is itself sufficient as drawings. The appearances of existence are themetaphorical or symbolic spiritual master. Regardless of the form you rely upon,whatever leads your mind to the sacred doctrine, that is the spiritual master.Since this is a concise illustrated version of the discourses and tantras,everyone can manage to examine it. The infinitely vast version, theillustrations in appearing existence, can be recognized by fortunate persons,who should not place their hopes in illustrations with black letters; that is,in print.We hear the doctrine to resolve our outer misunderstandings; we should meditateto resolve our inner misunderstandings. First, rely on human spiritual mastersas your spiritual master. Later, rely on books as your spiritual master.Finally, rely on your own mind as your spiritual master.First, we must be skilled in examining spiritual masters. Later, we must beskilled in relying upon them in word and deed. Finally, we must be skilled intraining in how spiritual masters, with towering waves of the realization ofwisdom mind and its conduct, act for the good of Buddhism and beings.It is inappropriate to train in wrong conduct, which consists of beings’ordinary acts and conduct related to the concerns of this life. These you mustforsake. If you follow the example of past holy persons’ lives, you will in turnbecome a holy individual. Therefore, turn your attention now to the sacredBuddhist doctrine. You must firmly turn your mind away from negative, corruptingacts and have your mind firmly merge with the ennobling, sacred doctrine.Search, as you would for nectar, for spiritual masters and guides who dwell nearennobling acts, and companions who are intent on ennobling acts, and then relyupon them.—Choying Tobden DorjeAnd so it—The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra—begins, with thesubject of discipleship. Our author does not explain that choice of the firstsubject his readers encounter; he simply makes an articulate case for the vitalimportance of the master-disciple relationship.Other translators sometimes render master-disciple as “teacher-student.” Icannot comment on the context in which that translation can be apt; here, ourauthor clearly describes a relationship that is highly charged, far beyond whatthe term “teacher-student” implies. If even very slight physical, verbal, ormental disrespect toward an individual will land us in hell in a futurerebirth—a fact we learn here—we are no longer in the territory ofstudent-teacher dynamics we’re familiar with outside tantric Buddhist practice.Our author also does not describe an individual who could be designated as apastor, minister, priest, rabbi, and so on, in the sense of someone who bringsthe presence of a religious tradition into the life of the community atsignificant junctures, such as births, comings of age, marriages, or funerals.Spiritual masters (gurus or lamas) can and do serve human communities, but theirprimary role is not to reinforce the ties that bind us to our loved ones, ourchosen careers, and our social roles. They live on the outskirts of our livesuntil Buddhist feelings stir within us—disillusionment, disenchantment,renunciation, for example—signs that the first of the Buddha’s four truths, thatof life’s intrinsic suffering or unsatisfactory nature, has hit home.In the passage directly above, Choying Tobden Dorje uses this opportunity tointroduce his drawings. For him, they belong under the category of spiritualmaster since they provide a first step to the recognition of the “metaphoricalor symbolic spiritual master,” that is, all appearing phenomena arising asindicators of the true nature of things.As for spiritual masters in general, he states that we must begin fostering arelationship with a human spiritual master, then enlarge our scope with books,and finally find the ultimate spiritual master within. After his lengthydescription in the main text of the complicated relationship we forge withBuddhist spiritual masters, a reader might wish to be spared that risky andperilous feature of the path. Can’t we do without the foibles and fallibility ofother human beings? Can’t we graduate directly to books or our own mind?It might seem like a tempting proposition. Even an example of a perfectdisciple, Lama Tharchin Rinpoche, would remark, laughing, that his experience ofdiscipleship meant that “I end up not doing much of what I wanted to do anddoing lots I never wanted to do.” Despite that, he was an enthusiastic andhumble disciple his entire life. He and all other spiritual masters I’ve triedto follow have stated unanimously that everyone must begin the Buddhist path asa disciple of a human being. This is obviously an opinion shared by ChoyingTobden Dorje: for him, discipleship comes first.BOOK 2: THE TRANSMISSION OF BUDDHISMThe sacred doctrine is like a wish-fulfilling jewel: whoever finds it gainseffortlessly everything needed and desired. Thus it is important to give thegift of the excellent rain of Buddhism’s jewels to all beings, both high andlow. Gifts of food or wealth can help relieve minor temporary suffering butcannot ease long-term suffering. Even minor teachings among the precious sacredBuddhist doctrine can end suffering that has lingered for many lifetimes. No onewishes to suffer. The cause of suffering is corrupting acts; the cause ofhappiness is ennobling acts. Ennobling acts are like nectar: you must gain themhowever you can. Corrupting acts are like poison that is fatal to the touch: youmust reject them however you can. This can be learned by listening to the sacreddoctrine.By applying yourself to the transmission of the precious sacred Buddhistdoctrine to the exclusion of all other activity, you will surely become arecipient of honor on the part of all beings, a spiritual master and guide. Youshould always teach. To the extent that you teach others, you should apply theseteachings to yourself and have your mind mix with experiential cultivation inspiritual practice. You must also be skilled in surely leading others to applythe teachings and to experiential cultivation. What we call “teaching Buddhism”is to prevent yourself and others from physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing,and to provide the means for application to ennobling acts.It is not enough to have understood the teachings once: you must listen to themrepeatedly, reflect upon the meaning of what you have heard, meditate upon themeaning of your contemplation, and rapidly bring your meditation into the domainof experience and realization. It is not enough to have eaten food once: youmust always eat, regularly nourishing your vitality. Likewise, you mustcontinually develop exertion in listening to the teachings. Any Buddhistteaching heard is excellent wealth that lasts for every lifetime, whereasordinary wealth is just borrowed.Faith is the supreme exalted jewel: if you cultivate the experience of thesacred Buddhist doctrine with faith, you will always be happy. Since you cansuffer even if materially wealthy, you should replace collecting wealth andpossessions with accumulation of the wealth of faith. If you are rich in thewealth of faith, you will surely become free from the prison of the round ofrebirth; material wealth will surely keep you in that prison. You might fill thetriple cosmos with various precious substances to offer to the buddhas, yet amoment’s faith in the teachings of the great way is more beneficial. With faith,you have positive qualities; if faith increases, ennobling, positive qualitiesincrease. If faith becomes clouded, ennobling, positive qualities decrease.Therefore, to increase faith, you should listen to spiritual masters’ teachingsand examine the Buddha’s word.You should turn your mind to the teachings that provide lasting happiness in thesame way as the hungry wish for food. You should search for instruction just asthe poor search for wealth. Even if the poor find wealth, they gain onlytemporary relief from the suffering of poverty, whereas striving for theBuddhist doctrine brings both temporary and lasting happiness. If you find thedoctrine, you find food and wealth along with them. If you become rich inBuddhism in your own stream of being, you will surely become rich in food,wealth, and possessions at the same time.Instead of planting seeds in the fields, plant seeds of faith in your own beingand have the sprouts of awakening grow. Instead of selling things for profit,engage in ennobling acts for the welfare of sentient beings: this will enrichyou with infinite goodness. Instead of caring for horses and wealth, protectyour own body, speech, and mind from the cliffs of corrupting wrongdoing. If youtake the path of ennobling acts, you will reach the land of enlightenment whilegaining horses and wealth along the way. If you want to never experiencesuffering again, cultivate the experience of the precious sacred doctrine. Ifyou want to always be happy without interruption, train assiduously in thesacred doctrine. Its root is to subdue your own mind. Since your own mindharbors negative habits, you find wrongdoing easy, but this must be firmlytransformed and turned toward ennobling acts. Once your mind turns towardennobling acts, it must never vacillate. You should vow to yourself, “May mymind never turn from the sacred Buddhist doctrine!”When you see a sacred text, take it and touch it to your head. When you hear thesacred instructions taught, listen with gladness. Train your body, speech, andmind in the conduct of the sacred Buddhist doctrine. You should consider how thecustoms of the sacred doctrine might be preserved for a long time. Think, “May Idevelop energetic application to the various ways the sacred teachings ofBuddha’s doctrine can spread and flourish, and how sentient beings can put theminto practice!” If you always maintain that intention and apply it, you willsurely attain enlightenment.—Choying Tobden DorjeThe transmission of Buddhism in its entirety involves many different anddivergent levels of truth and of teaching styles. Choying Tobden Dorje treatsthree levels—discourses, tantras, and great perfection tantras—separately anddoes not look back to do a comparative study of views and terminologies, a studythat would likely require a whole book to itself. Suffice it to say that to readand appreciate the full range of Tibetan Buddhist literature requires us tobecome tricultural (or quadricultural, if we note the divide in the discoursesbetween the lesser and great way approaches).Some features do not change from the beginning to the end of the paths ofBuddhist training. These include discipleship of the previous book, and in thisbook, the process of transmission and faith. Where some translators use the word“study,” I have translated words literally here as either “listening” or“hearing” where either appears. Again, Choying Tobden Dorje seems to intend thatthose words be taken literally in his work. As for the subject of faith, I foundits inclusion here startling at first—it constitutes a telling choice on thepart of our author. Certainly, it influenced my avoidance of the word “study”since remarkable advances in “Buddhist studies” continue to issue from secularenvironments where a teacher, student, or researcher’s faith in the subject isirrelevant. It is entirely possible that our author would be delighted by thesituation in the present day; nevertheless, what he clearly meant then cannot berendered as something along the lines of a “student working with a teacher tostudy Buddhism,” language sometimes used in translation to describe thisprocess.Textual Buddhism often mentions the three-step process of listening or hearing,then reflection, then meditation, yet in more direct instruction (which I haveassisted as a translator), another three-step process more often supplants it:understanding, then experience, then realization. Choying Tobden Dorje refers tothis framework in the introduction: “Those on the path of cultivationunderstand; those on the path of application experience; and those on the pathof seeing realize. Or, it is said that we first understand the meaning of thetext, then experience it, and finally realize it.” The Tibetan word renderedhere as “experience” can also mean “to taste” or “to savor” the flavor ofsomething. When faced with bright modern minds whose lives have been definedfrom a young age by their experience in educational institutions, some Tibetanlamas express their hope and expectation that their disciples will not only“learn about” Buddhism, as they’re so well-trained to do, but to draw it intothe realms of spiritual experience and realization.BOOK 3: OUR PRECIOUS HUMAN LIFEWhat is called the difficult attainment of a free and fully endowed human lifecannot be equated with every human being. It refers to those human beings whohave a spiritual practice. What we call a precious human life can be found amongthose who assiduously apply themselves equally to hearing, reflecting, andmeditating on the sacred Buddhist doctrine and to the continual use of skillfulmeans to calm and tame their own minds. When their meditative experience andrealization dawn, they teach the nectar of the sacred doctrine to others, allsentient beings, our venerable mothers, who are plunged in the darkness ofignorance and have plummeted into the prison pit of existence, to free them fromthe round of rebirth’s sufferings and to place them on the excellent path ofliberation. Now that you have the power to do so, it is very important that yougive careful consideration to transforming your life to such a precious humanlife.From the perspective of its cause, examples, numbers, and essence, the precioushuman life, replete with every freedom and endowment, is extremely difficult toattain. Therefore, now that you have for once gained it, you should not use itto defeat enemies, protect friends, or to search for and hoard food or wealth.In whatever way possible, you should turn your mind to the sacred Buddhistdoctrine that is an excellent means to achieve your long-term wishes. If youbegin at a young age to firmly apply yourself to Buddhism, becoming someone whocompletes their spiritual practice, your present and your future will be happy.If you waste this human life in meaningless, materialist acts, you defeat yourown purpose. You should undertake a prodigious stream of activity to aidBuddhism and beings in general, and to reverse the large river of yourwrongdoing. You should ensure that your legacy will definitely be that ofhelpful contributions to Buddhism and to beings.If you now become distracted in various meaningless acts related to thecircumstances of this life and don’t grasp the essence of this life, it is as ifa jewel came into your hands and you didn’t use it to gain what you needed anddesired. From now on, you should maintain an intense determination to put intopractice only ennobling acts and to fully seize the essence of this life. If youdo so according to the teachings, your present and future lives will be happy;if you don’t, your present and future lives will surely be miserable. Therefore,you should gladly undergo hardships in your spiritual life, should they benecessary.The precious sacred doctrine is the source of happiness: with your eyes, readthe Buddhist scriptures; with your ears, listen to the words of the teachings;with your mind, reflect on their meaning; with your mouth, teach othersBuddhism. With your body, engage in Buddhist conduct: when sitting, sit as aBuddhist; when walking, walk as a Buddhist; when eating, eat as a Buddhist;whatever you do, do as a Buddhist, in keeping with the life stories of holymasters of the past. If persons are in discord, do what you can to createharmony. When harmony reigns, make it even stronger. By doing so, you help bothyourself and others; this life, the next, and the period between lifetimes willbe naturally, seamlessly happy; you will effortlessly accomplish all your plans;and everything you have done will become part of your path to awakening. Thus,if the thought arises in your mind, “I have nothing on my mind apart fromBuddhism,” this constitutes supreme spiritual experience and realization.—Choying Tobden DorjeThe subject of what constitutes a precious human life is often the firstinstruction given to beginners. It forms one of the touchstones of Buddhistspiritual practice—that just the fact of our having such a life is moresignificant and potentially more meaningful than any obvious social or culturalmarker of success. It is the rarest, most valuable gem in the world, and wealready own it.What I found interesting is that Choying Tobden Dorje devotes a whole “book” (byhis standard) to this subject, as well as the following three—impermanence,karma, and the sufferings of the round of rebirth. These four make slim volumes,and could have been gathered together under the oft-used heading of “fourreflections to turn our minds to spiritual practice.” Instead, he places thesefour subjects on the same level as other books of considerable girth within thislarger work.To be clear, the point of reflection on our human life is not to persuadeourselves that human life has some special intrinsic value apart from theopportunity it provides for exiting the round of rebirth. Other forms of lifeare as precious to their inhabitants as our own is to us. Yet beings of otherkinds—gods, demigods, animals, and so on—are overwhelmed by their environments,the narratives of their dramas, be they utterly blissful or sheer torture. Wehumans can decide to opt out of the (human) rat race, to spend what years ofhealth and well being remain to us in the pursuit of regaining the enlightenmentthat is the nature of every being equally from the tiniest insect to the highestbuddha.BOOK 4: REFLECTION ON DEATH AND IMPERMANENCEThe Transmission of the Monastic Code of Conduct states, “Compared to giving onehundred fully ordained persons their noon meal and an offering, how much betterit is to give a moment’s thought to the impermanence of composite phenomena!”Therefore, repeated recollection of death and impermanence has very considerablebenefits. This meditation on death is a profound teaching. Meditation on deathalone is certain to subdue your mind, even without such practices as verbalrecitations of prayers.To repeat the experience of recalling your own death is what is called“experiential cultivation.” To reflect on death is meditation. If you do notbring death to mind, you become agitated with the many things you need and themany things you have to do. Your leisure time disappears and your spiritualpractice stagnates. By remembering death, you feel you don’t need anything andyou do nothing besides spiritual practice. Therefore, you should always meditateon the certainty of your death, the unpredictability of the time of your death,and the uncertainty of the eventual cause of your death.Remembering death will turn your attention from its attachment to activityrelated to this life’s events. You will mentally reject wrongdoing related tothis life and the thought to practice the authentic doctrine will naturally wellup in you. By acting according to the Buddhist doctrine, you will attain freedomand the state of omniscience. Therefore, to initially recall death makes yourattention turn to the doctrine. To subsequently recall death makes you neverturn away from the doctrine. To recall death at last has you gain stability inthe nature of reality, the ultimate abiding state. Therefore to meditate ondeath is crucial.If you want to become someone who practices Buddhism correctly, recall death. “Iwon’t die now” is the thought through which all decline arrives: you must rejectit. To repeatedly recall death opens the gate to the source of all that ismagnificent. You must join your mind to that thought.It is certain that you will die and be forced to abandon this body and to leave.What then is this pleasant house for? These beautiful clothes and jewelry? Thisdelicious food and drink, these plentiful expensive objects, this extensiveretinue of many servants, this high rank, these many family members and friends,and so on? Even though you own a lot of these things, you will have to leavethem all and go alone to your future life. This pleasant house you built will beanother’s. These beautiful clothes and jewelry you have arranged will be worn byanother. Likewise, all the activity that appears in this life is ultimatelydeceptive. Happiness is like a rainbow in space—very fine, but ephemeral. Yourclose companions and possessions are like those you saw in last night’s dream,impermanent. You have no control over your own body: you must take anotherrebirth. That as well will be impermanent and you will have to take yet another.Births and deaths are innumerable; suffering, limitless—they are the resultsolely of not recalling death.You must seize the innate citadel of deathlessness. When you cut the root ofbirth and death, you rid yourself of the ignorance that attends them. Becomefamiliar with awareness, the awakened mind. To genuinely accomplish theteachings on death, abandon concern for this life, live in seclusion where noother humans live. Live alone in the mountains and meditate on death during yoursix daily meditation sessions. Since this was the principal experientialcultivation of past holy masters, meditation on death leads to enlightenment inone lifetime. Whoever meditates on death now finds the sacred Buddhist doctrineeffective. Who meditates on death in the future conforms to the sacred doctrine.You can’t live longer than seventy or eighty years in all, and many die suddenlydue to obstacles’ accidents. Therefore, don’t lend your attention to this life;prepare yourself for the next. At death, your guides are your spiritual masters:rely on them. Your enjoyments will be your ennobling acts: collect them. Yourrefuge will be the three jewels: make offerings to them. This illusory body isrented: you will have to leave it. You protect your body with love, yet you mustabandon it. You energetically accumulate wealth and objects, yet you must leavethem. You really love your family and friends, yet you must part. You have lotsof things you have left to do, yet you must forsake them. At death, all thestuff of this life is of no use to you: why be so attached to it?From now on, sincerely recall death. Be content with the food and wealth youhave, and stop caring for gain and honor. Forsake cultivating friendships; giveup struggling with enemies; abandon your projects. From this moment on, youshould genuinely cultivate your experience in the sacred doctrine that willsurely prove useful at death. You must be energetic in the means to ensure thatyour mind will be happy and free from regret at death. You need the firmconfidence that after death, regardless of what appearances arise during theperiod between lifetimes, you will recognize them as if meeting an oldacquaintance. Continually say the words, “Death, death . . .” Think about it.Keep death firmly in mind and meditate on it. Even if you are skilled inBuddhist teaching, without meditation on death, you aren’t a practicingBuddhist. Those who make meditation on death the core of their spiritual liveswill surely become pure Buddhists.—Choying Tobden DorjeContemplation of our inevitable demise is a practice common to all forms ofBuddhism; its benefits are easily understood and commonly accepted. In short,remembering death is akin to splashing cold water on our face to sharpen oursenses. Refreshed, we continue our spiritual practice with renewed vigor.That is the usual story, but midway through retelling it, our author introducesus here to an altogether different approach: “You must seize the innate citadelof deathlessness.” This is to say, reflection on death can be more than a prodto goad us into spiritual practice. Reflection on death can be an end in itself,a way to discover what never dies. Here, he refers to what never dies as“innate,” which is to say that we are not responsible for creating it byspiritual practice. We contemplate death to turn our attention away from allthat will soon perish—everything—but we also eventually turn away fromconcentration upon death itself.He then writes, “When you cut the root of birth and death, you rid yourself ofthe ignorance that attends them.” We do not worship death: ignorance accompaniesit as much as lack of wakefulness permeates our mundane life. Reflection ondeath is the antidote to any attachment to life; once that sickness is cured, westop taking the medicine, to instead, “Become familiar with awareness, theawakened mind.”This is a stunning sentence, as it shows our author tipping his hand. He hasslipped out of the guise of a common Buddhist teacher into that of a greatperfection master. He equates “the innate citadel of deathlessness” withawareness, which he in turn identifies as the awakened mind. To briefly unpackthe language used here, “awareness” in this context refers to our naturalcapacity for an experiential mode other than “I am aware of . . . (something).”Our author asks us to turn away from mundane awareness (what all livingcreatures are endowed with) to deathless awareness, which predates our life asany living creature in any world. He refers to such awareness as “awakenedmind,” a synonym for buddha nature. (As such, the term as used here cannot becomfortably back-translated into the Sanskrit bodhichitta or into such terms as“mind of awakening” or “awakening mind” that suggest a state of mind, howeverexalted, that is part of a process.) According to Choying Tobden Dorje and thetradition of great perfection he here represents, the successful conclusion ofreflection on death and impermanence ends in “seizing the citadel” of ourindwelling deathless enlightened nature.BOOK 5: THE WORKINGS OF KARMACommission of the ten corrupting acts, motivated by the three or five poisons,only results in suffering and will not produce happiness. Commission of the tenennobling acts, free from the three or five poisons, results in happiness andwill not produce suffering. Among beings, those who are happy enjoy theconsequence of ennobling acts; those tormented by suffering experience theconsequence of corrupting acts. Those who experience a mixture of happiness andsuffering enjoy the consequence of a mixture of ennobling acts and wrongdoing.Those who experience mainly happiness and a little suffering enjoy theconsequence of mainly ennobling acts and a few corrupting acts. Those whoexperience mainly suffering and a little happiness have the consequence ofmostly corrupting acts and a few ennobling acts. The results of happiness andsuffering within the round of rebirth grow from the seeds of ennobling acts andwrongdoing. Just as hot seeds produce hot fruit, corrupting seeds will surelyproduce suffering. Just as sweet seeds produce sweet fruit, ennobling seeds willsurely produce happiness. Round seeds will not produce oblong fruit; oblongseeds will not produce round fruit.You must understand in detail the meaning of what is called “action, karma, andconsequences.” If you claim that you do an ennobling act in committing anovertly corrupting act in the name of an illusory (that is, false) ennoblingact—for example, by killing an animal and offering its flesh and blood—you havedone a corrupting act. This will produce suffering. When, as a consequence of aminor corrupting act, your body is afflicted by a minor pain of sickness, andyou wonder what karma you’ve accumulated that has led to this unbearablesuffering, someone might tell you, “Suffering results from corrupting acts,therefore don’t do what is corrupting!” If you don’t listen to such advice andkill an animal to cure your sickness, or kill to cheat death, or commitcorrupting acts in order to practice “ennobling acts,” this constitutesmisguided religious practice. This is actually an outward-oriented non-Buddhistpractice, not the Buddha’s doctrine.The true doctrine of the Buddha states: “Leave any wrongdoing behind,” toindicate that wrongdoing is never appropriate. “Make perfect ennobling actsyours” indicates that what is called “an ennobling act” is magnificently purethroughout its basis, intention, act, and completion. The Buddha said to engagein such acts. “Subdue your own mind” indicates that the root of abandonment ofcorrupting acts and the practice of ennobling acts depends upon the essentialsubduing of your own mind, these wild and rough habits. If your mind tendstoward corrupting acts, wrongdoing will result and you will experiencesuffering. If your mind tends toward ennobling acts, ennobling acts will resultand you will experience happiness. Therefore, you must firmly turn your mindaway from corrupting acts and firmly lead it to ennobling acts, which bringhappiness.It is said that on the middle level of the path of cultivation, we meditate onthe four aspects of genuine renunciation: in the future, do not developnegative, corrupting attitudes that have not yet arisen; stem corruptingattitudes that are present in your mind; firmly develop ennobling attitudes thathave not yet arisen in your mind; and increase ennobling attitudes that have.The body and voice follow the mind in rejecting corrupting acts and in constantdiligence in ennobling acts. Therefore, exalted hearers and solitary sagesmeditate in this way on the middle level of the path of cultivation. Thebodhisattvas meditate in this way on the great way middle level of the path ofcultivation during innumerable eons, cultivate stores of goodness and wisdom,and become buddhas. If we ourselves meditate in this way, we will surely becomefree from the round of rebirth’s sufferings and surely attain the happiness offreedom and omniscience.What is called “the teaching of the path of cultivation” presents this. What iscalled “entering the path of cultivation” is to have the mind enter thisspiritual path. This is the meaning of “discipline by completely subduing yourown mind.” This is “mind training.” This is “the Buddha’s doctrine.” This basicabandonment of the ten corrupting acts and the practice of the ten ennoblingacts, in different contexts, constitutes the vows and bonds of the three codesof Buddhist conduct—individual liberation, bodhisattva, and mantra.No one cherishes anything more than they do their own life, therefore renounceharming others’ lives in thought or deed. Give up eating food made from fleshand blood. Don’t wear clothing made of leather. The appearances of this life arebut a momentary dream. Let go entirely of acts related to this life andaccomplish what is lastingly useful. Compared to the misfortune of having nofood or clothing now, later suffering as a starving spirit or in hell isgreater. Therefore firmly give your attention to contemplation of how you can behappy later.This encouragement has been given by Choying Tobden Dorje.In this afterword, our author does not deviate from the traditional presentationof the fundamental Buddhist teaching on karma. Above, under the heading ofimpermanence, he remarks, “Even if you are skilled in Buddhist teaching, withoutmeditation on death, you aren’t a practicing Buddhist.” He does not make asimilar statement concerning the subject of karma, but it could be said that areligious tradition lacking a presentation of karma and its consequences cannotclaim to be Buddhist. Buddhist sacred literature is replete with descriptions ofthe workings of karma; the path of realization in Buddhism has threeindispensible ingredients, the first of which is ethical conduct, anchored inbelief in karma (the other two are meditative stability and sublime insight).The subject stands as a pillar of the Buddhist faith.I have most often reserved the Sanskrit word karma for the Tibetan word “gyu”(rgyu) although karma as the word is understood in Tibetan (as “lé,” las) refersjust to an act itself, be it physical, verbal, or mental. Nevertheless, the wordkarma, if it is used at all in English, comes with the implication of aninvisible glue that connects us to our acts until they produce a result, atwhich point their force expires. “What goes around comes around,” so the sayinggoes, a modern version of “as you sow so shall you reap.” Technically, the wordkarma refers only to the sowing, not the reaping. Nevertheless, when someonesays that an event reflects a person’s “karma,” I believe that what is impliedis not some original act or set of acts (including habitual mental patterns thathave crystallized into an individual’s perceived “character”). Rather, I thinkthat in popular usage, so-and-so’s “karma” refers to the sense that acts have alife of their own, that they lead to consequences for the doer in entirelydifferent circumstances at a much later date. Although that is not a technicallycorrect use of the term “karma,” I have accepted it: thus, instead of “karma,cause, and consequences” we read here “action, karma, and consequences.”The Tibetan terms géwa and mi-géwa have long proved troublesome for translators:they have been rendered elsewhere as “virtuous and nonvirtuous,” “wholesome andunwholesome,” or simply, “positive and negative.” Here, I have added anotheroption: “ennobling and corrupting,” in the hope that these words point to theexperience of the doer of acts as varied as, on the one hand, theft, idlechatter, murder, and a lack of belief in past or future lives, for example; andon the other, generosity, meaningful speech, nurturing life, and the belief thatour acts will outlive the self that we are now until their impetus has beenexhausted.Under the heading of corrupting acts, we note that the description of “wrongsexual conduct” is addressed to individuals whose object of desire is female.The many readers for whom that is not the case will have to change the wordingto better suit their preferences. While this text (and some others I have read)relegate penetration of “other openings” as a corrupting act, I have not heardany modern high lama defend this injunction. To the contrary, one master’scomment was that no form of desire can be considered ennobling and that theobjects of our desire are individual matters, one person’s desired object beingno better or worse than another’s. I translated those remarks in the course ofthe public talk during which they were made, in the 1980s. More recently in awell-attended public talk, another high Tibetan master ridiculed heterosexualmen for any pride they have because they crave one kind of opening to penetratewhile looking down on others who crave penetration of a different shaped opening(the word “homosexual” was left unspoken but clearly implied). That same masteronce remarked outside of the context of a public talk that, when confronted bythe bewildering gamut of sexual behavior reported by the consenting adults amonghis disciples, he was left wondering whether their remarkable flexibility wasdue to past life profound training in overcoming notions of pure and impure,cleanliness and filth, or due to past lives as dogs.In any case, many (most?) Tibetan masters exposed to free-wheeling modern sexualmores have taken an “enlightened” attitude: in the words of advice of one masterto his inquiring disciples, “I think it’s better to let people be as they are.”To be clear, this remark was made in the context of sexual conduct betweenconsenting adults not bound by religious or secular vows.37[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st37] My impression is that, in their heart of hearts,most lamas would like their disciples to try out (for a short or long term) aradical form of sexual behavior—celibacy. In Buddhism, celibacy vows precludeany form of sexual conduct, heterosexual or homosexual. Apart from that wishwhich the lamas mostly keep to themselves, they do not seem interested inrefereeing others’ active sexual lives.I have digressed here because this subject of religious prohibitions of ourintimate lives can be extremely distressing. Were I an editor of the originaltext, I would have asked the author to kindly delete those few words. Myprincipal role, however, is as translator of the text as we find it, and here asreporter of the evolving attitudes of Tibetan masters of ancient wisdom in themodern world.To return to the main text, right at the beginning of Book 5, our authordescribes the “storehouse of all dualistic experience,” which underlies all ourmundane acts, positive or negative. His statement that this “storehouse” has “noprimordial existence” can be understood using the example of ice. Certainspecific conditions cause ice to form and it continues in that form for as longas those conditions persist. When conditions change, what was once solid icechanges to water—its ice-ness vanishes without a trace. Water that was once icecan evaporate to become something else again, and so on. Ice, then, has “noprimordial existence”—it was not always as it appears to us, nor does it havesome intrinsic quality that ensures that it will last. Conditions outside theice—cold—created it; when the cold disappears, ice has no inborn ice-ness tocall upon to save it.Here, the storehouse of all dualistic experience is the ice of our existence—theseemingly solid but temporary bedrock of our sense of self. It is the“storehouse” of all our acts, good or evil, and it provides the ground for theexperience of their effects—our experience of a self and a world; that is tosay, dualistic experience. In itself, the storehouse is neither good nor bad: itis referred to as “undetermined.” Nightmares or states of ecstatic bliss form onit, yet it itself is as numb as a movie screen. We live, act, and experienceourselves on its ground, and all the while it simply stores whatever we think,say, or do for as long as our dualistic experience persists. And that is thekey: it has “no primordial existence.” The searing cold of our lack of awarenessof our true nature creates it, but when that cold disappears, it does as well.I cannot help but note that “storehouse of all dualistic experience” is anunwieldy term. We might well ask ourselves what word in pre-Buddhist Englishthat corresponds to. I am not so foolish to imagine that Buddhist terminology inEnglish will “go there,” yet the closest correspondent term is “the soul” in thesense of an aspect of our being that our acts imprint, and which outlives us.The fatal flaw with the term “soul” in a Buddhist context is that, while webelieve that whatever it (a soul, a storehouse) does in fact survive our demise,it is not in any way immortal or eternal.Regardless of the name we give this stratum of our being, it is important thatwe differentiate it from our enlightened, or “buddha,” nature. If we use commonlanguage for our storehouse of all dualistic experience—soul—this other aspectof our being might be called our “spirit” (but won’t be, for many reasons). Thestorehouse of all dualistic experience is, in the end, a composite, impermanentthing, albeit one that endures for countless lifetimes. Buddha nature is notcomposite or impermanent; it is everlasting. The storehouse of all dualisticexperience is an impartial repository, a deep level of our being that might becalled our “basic numbness,” whereas our buddha nature is far deeper still andhas been called our “basic goodness.”The subjects of karma and consequences, the storehouse of all dualisticexperience, and (implicitly) buddha nature underlie a passage in Book 5 underthe heading of “The Consequences of Ripened Ennobling Acts”:In the desire realm, the main form of conscious experience is the sevencollections of consciousness: the six collections of sense-based consciousnessarisen in response to sensory fields plus coarse consciousness that has arisenfrom circumstances. In the form realm, the main form of conscious experience ismeditative stability within clarity without discursive thought. This dwellswithin the ongoing state of the storehouse consciousness itself. In the formlessrealm, the main form of conscious experience is the meditative state ofone-pointed tranquility. This dwells within the ongoing state of the storehouseof all dualistic experience, while the other aspects of consciousness exist aslatent potentials.To restate this, we are beings of the desire realm, and our customary experienceis here subsumed as seven bandwidths of consciousness—one for each of the sixsenses (the mental function, or mental switchboard, being number six), pluscircumstantial consciousness. This describes the totality of our dailyexperience.The beings who live in the form realm are gods more evolved than us in thedesire realm—their consciousness consists of clarity or lucidity without thepresence of thoughts. This the author equates with immersion in a deeper levelof consciousness, called the storehouse consciousness; that is, the firstsuspended and sustained moment of individuation.Beings of the formless realm are disembodied “gods,” for want of a better term,entirely absorbed in the storehouse of all dualistic experience—boundlessneutral numbness with nothing to trouble that infinite stillness. Althoughdegrees of this composure must be extremely subtle, four are identified based onthe individual’s impression of the experience: infinite space, infiniteconsciousness, nothing whatsoever, and the pinnacle of existence. The name ofthis last state means what it implies: this constitutes the highest possiblelimit of any sentient being’s range of experience.In relation to our everyday experience, our waking life involves the coarseaspects of consciousness related to our senses, as mentioned above. Our dreamlife takes place within the storehouse consciousness and the subtle aspects ofconsciousness related to our senses. When we fall into deep sleep, where we landis the ground, or storehouse, of all dualistic experience. Our author finishesthis section by including a quote on the subject from Asanga’s Bodhisattvas’Stages of Awakening:A state without thoughts that is unrelated to sensory fields is the experientialcontext of the storehouse of all dualistic experience itself. A state withoutthoughts that is related to sensory fields is the experiential context of thestorehouse consciousness. Awareness of each sensory field is the experientialcontext of the five sense-based aspects of consciousness. The initial arising ofthoughts in relation to sensory fields, followed by examination, createsdualistic experience—the experiential context of the mental function’sconsciousness and the afflicted mind.What is the author’s point in sharing this information? The title of the sectiongives a clue: “The Consequences of Ripened Ennobling Acts.” He is informing usthat these states are the final consequences of all good, ennobling acts done inlife, be they performed in mundane circumstances, or those of non-Buddhistreligious practice, or those of unguided practice of meditation, Buddhist orother. Such acts lead to extremely exalted states of being . . . but not tofreedom. Good karma can take us only so far.Under the headings of acts and results that are consistent with, or lead to,freedom, our author does not go into detail and instead promises, “Thesesubjects will be clearly presented in detail below, in chapters that describethe discourses’ and tantras’ foundation, path, and result.” What we’re left withamounts to a cautionary tale, one with a history: Longchenpa famously remarkedon the subject of ennobling states of well-meaning but misguided meditation,Days and nights can passIn such meditationYet it amountsTo a fettering preoccupation,Like the gods’ meditative stability,So the Victor declared.One lama for whom I translated was a recent arrival from Tibet. Some peopleworried aloud to him concerning the pitfalls of “blind faith.” He replied thatfrom what he had seen so far outside Tibet, people were more prone to fallingprey to something worse, a mistaken state he coined “blind meditation.” Ibelieve this is what our author implies here, but we have to wait a couple ofvolumes and a thousand pages for the other shoe to drop: a description of howand why and what meditation actually leads directly to freedom.The last note to be added to Book 5 concerns the relation between a belief inkarma and the development of compassion. Our culture teaches us to expect thebad guys or girls to be punished or thwarted in the end, and the good guys orgirls to win the battle and the prize of the object of their desires. To adegree, this is a reasonable expectation, as long as one can wait some lifetimesfor the happy ending to transpire, for transpire it inevitably will. As ourauthor has informed us, good karma can only lead to happiness, bad karma canonly lead to suffering. As one great bodhisattva declared, “The arc of the moraluniverse is long but it bends toward justice.”Yet our learned satisfaction in the villains’ defeat and comeuppance—they wereso unspeakably vile, they deserved all that and more—is little more thanill-will. As Buddhists following the Tibetan tradition, we can never utter thewords, “Well, that’s their karma” and be satisfied with anyone’s suffering, orbe content to retreat to a detached seeming equanimity: “Karma’s a bitch, isn’tit?” If we see—karma forbid—our mother hit by a car, we don’t stand by the roadand contemplate that this event amounts to her just desserts, or reflect sagelyon the unfathomable mysteries of karma’s unfolding. We move to help her rightaway without even a first thought, let alone a second one. The examination ofthe workings of karma is meant to provide a mirror that we raise to view onlyourselves. Having done so, our attitude toward all others, no matter how evil,is to pray that their bad karma and its effects come entirely to us, and thatour good karma and its effects go entirely to them. As Buddhists our deepestwish is for even the worst monsters to never experience the consequences oftheir evil deeds; we send them to pure lands where they live happily ever after,no longer as sentient beings but as buddhas. That’s the end Buddhists arepraying and practicing for.BOOK 6: THE FLAWS OF THE ROUND OF REBIRTHIn the past, within the range of lands in the ten directions of the round ofrebirth, there is no place you have not taken birth, no place you have notcalled home. In all ten directions of space, there is no place you have nottaken birth. Wherever you have been born within the round of rebirth, the natureof that rebirth was only suffering. Those who have high worldly rank suffer inan upper prison; the humble suffer in a lower prison—there’s no otherdifference! If all the flesh and bones of your past lives were gatheredtogether, their mass would equal the size of this worldly realm; all your mucusand blood, the oceans. The pile of heads you have lost due to desire would reachthe heaven of Brahma; the tears you have shed would fill an ocean. The number ofbodies you have had as a snake or as an eater of filth would equal SupremeMountain.From now on, you must be reborn innumerable, uncountable times within this placeof suffering, the round of rebirth. If you kill one sheep, it is certain that infive hundred lives you will be killed just as that sheep was slaughtered.Likewise, if you kill by suffocating ten sheep, goats, birds, pigs, cows, orother such animals, you will be killed by suffocation in five thousandlifetimes. If you behead one hundred animals, you will die by beheading in fiftythousand lifetimes. If you kill one thousand animals by cutting open theirchests, it is certain that you will die by having your chest cut open in fivehundred thousand lifetimes.If you have another person kill a sheep, this enters the stream of being of bothpersons: the slaughterer will be killed five hundred times; you, the orderer,one thousand times. If you order the slaughter of a thousand animals, theslaughterer will be killed five hundred thousand times; the orderer, fivemillion.What is called the ripening of karma is this: if you bind a sheep withmulticolored cord and kill it with a black-handled knife, in five hundredlifetimes you will be bound with a multicolored cord and killed with ablack-handled knife. If you kill someone by striking the right side of theirhead with a triangular black stone, in five hundred lifetimes you will surely bekilled by being struck in the right side of the head with a triangular blackstone. If you cut off someone’s leg without killing them, in five hundredlifetimes you will have your leg cut off without it killing you. Therefore, donot commit wrongdoing!If you snare and kill a fox or another animal, you will be reborn five hundredtimes as an animal and be snared and killed. If you sell five hundred animals tobe killed for food, for clothing, for ornaments or necessities, or for any otherreason, you will be reborn fifty thousand times and be sold for slaughter forothers’ food, clothing, or needs. If you skin one hundred animals, you will beskinned in fifty thousand lifetimes. If you pierce the nose or castrate onehundred animals, during fifty thousand lifetimes you will have your nose piercedor be castrated. If you burden an animal with ten loads, you will have to carryloads during five thousand years. If you beat an animal with a crop one thousandtimes, you will be beaten five hundred thousand times. If you eat another’s arm,your karma will cause your arm to be eaten by others in five hundred lifetimes.If you eat another’s inner organs, such as the heart, one hundred times, infifty thousand lifetimes, others will eat your inner organs, such as your heart.If you wear others’ skin on your head, feet, or back ten times, in five thousandlifetimes, others will wear your skin on their head, feet, or back.What is called the ripening of karma resembles the way that when you plantwheat, much wheat grows; when you plant barley, much barley appears. Thus it isimpossible that the way you kill others now will not ripen to you in preciselythe same way. Just as hot seeds produce hot fruit, the poison of corruptingwrongdoing will produce many poisonous results of suffering. Those who commitwrongdoing jump into a ravine from which there is no escape. They drink poisonedwater. They wear weapons. Don’t commit corrupting acts!Later, you will take rebirth and then die in this great ocean of the round ofrebirth’s suffering one hundred times, one thousand, ten thousand, one hundredthousand, a million, ten million, one hundred million, a billion, and countlessmore times. If you feel very afraid of a single death now, why aren’t you afraidof that many deaths? The result of ennobling acts will give you happiness duringsome lifetimes, but if you have not sealed those acts with dedication of theforce of their goodness to the goal of the attainment of enlightenment, theireffects easily dissipate. The acts of wrongdoing of body, speech, and mind thatyou have done are innumerable; their result will be innumerable experiences ofsuffering. Previous lifetimes’ ennobling acts or wrongdoing will result in manymore unendingly numerous lifetimes. The result of karma accumulated by this bodymust ripen during many future eons. This has been a rough explanation of how itis that each act ripens into five hundred results.In detail, the basis of the act of killing, the sentient being killed—such as ahuman being, an animal, a bodhisattva, your parents, or a spiritualmaster—determines the relative gravity of the act. Further, theintention—stupidity, desire, anger—determines the act’s gravity. Even the act,such as the duration of the being’s suffering at death, determines its gravity.That the result of one act of killing should ripen five hundred times isextremely light. If you even slightly harm such beings as your parents, aspiritual master, or a bodhisattva, you will have to experience many eons ofsuffering during lifetimes too numerous to calculate.If you think that it is untrue—that the accumulation of karma will not ripen insuch ways—this signals the arising of wrong views. Among the ten corruptingacts, wrong views are the most serious. Who harbors wrong views is not aBuddhist.If you wish in the future to not take rebirth in the round of rebirth and tostop this stream of suffering, you must realize the meaning of the nonexistenceof the self sensed in phenomena and the nonexistence of the self sensed in you,the individual—profound emptiness, the great mother of all buddhas, theperfection of sublime insight. You must reverse your clinging to the reality ofphenomena. You must end your dualistic experience. You must gain stability inthe meaning of the inconceivable nature of reality. Therefore, for however muchtime is left in your life, single-mindedly cultivate your experience in thisprofound teaching. When you realize emptiness, your freedom from the sufferingof the round of rebirth is ensured. When you gain stability in the meaning ofnonarising, it is no longer necessary to take rebirth. Without birth, there isno cause for sickness, no cause for aging, and no cause for death.Without realization of emptiness, pure conduct results in the experience ofhappy realms of gods and humans, but when its goodness is exhausted, you mustexperience the result of wrongdoing—suffering. Due to your lack of familiaritywith ennobling acts, their force is weak. From time immemorial, you have insteadfamiliarized yourself with corrupting wrongdoing, thus such acts are stronglyingrained in you and easy to repeat—you can effortlessly accumulate negativekarma. Thus you will have to experience suffering uninterruptedly.Without reflection on the extent of suffering inherent in this and all lives,when you don’t have food or clothing during this life, you suffer, and when youhave some food or clothes, you’re happy. However, wrongdoing increases inproportion to the food and wealth you own: wealth must be sustained andprotected, fields must be sown, and profits must be made in commerce, and so on.Food and wealth thus gained are food and wealth gained through wrongdoing. Foodand wealth gained through theft, robbery, and defeat of others are even morenegative. To not practice Buddhism correctly but to present yourself as aspiritual person and to enjoy the food offered by faithful persons and the foodand wealth of the dead (given for funeral ceremonies) entails debts that aredifficult to repay. Therefore it is very important to develop contentment and toharbor few desires.Desire, wrath, and foolishness are our three enemies: you must renounce them. Itis due to these three that you experienced suffering in your past lives, fromtime immemorial. In the future, it will be due to these three poisons that youwill have to take innumerable rebirths and experience suffering. Why do youexperience suffering now? It is due to these three poisons. Therefore, considerthese three poisons your enemies. If you didn’t have this anger, how could thesuffering of hell arise? If you didn’t have this desire and greed, how could thesufferings of the starving spirits arise? If you didn’t have this stupidity, howcould the suffering of the animals arise? Without jealousy, you couldn’t takerebirth as a demigod. Without pride, you can’t be reborn a god. Without desire,you won’t be reborn a human being. Without the five poisons, plus greed, thesixth, rebirth among the round of rebirth’s six kinds of beings is impossible.If you have the five poisons, you will accumulate the ten corrupting acts; theirresults, suffering, will occur. You must firmly renounce the source of suchsuffering—the mental afflictions and corrupting acts.If you take what is not given once, you will be reborn poor five hundred times.If you engage in ten relationships of wrongful acts of desire, you will rebornfive thousand times with an unattractive companion and many enemies. If you tellone hundred lies, you will be reborn fifty thousand times in lives where you arecheated by others and blamed. If you say one thousand words of divisive speech,you will be reborn five hundred thousand times friendless and in disharmony withothers. If you say ten thousand harsh words, you will be reborn fifty milliontimes always hearing unpleasant words. If you engage once in meaningless speech,in five hundred lifetimes your every word will be considered untrue. If you havecoveted ten times, in five thousand lifetimes your hopes will be unfulfilled. Ifyou have developed malice one hundred times, in fifty thousand lifetimes youwill be often threatened by harm. If you have held one thousand wrong views, infive hundred thousand lifetimes you will dwell in wrong views.—Choying Tobden DorjeHonestly, is there anything more to say on this subject? I think not. Yet in themain text of Book 6, the author opened a subject I wished he had left tightlyclosed—the Buddhist attitude toward terminating pregnancy. Here, and in Book 7,he quotes from classical Buddhist texts that reflect the belief that life beginsat conception. Thus, the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy is equated,karmically, with ending a life. I would be surprised to hear of any Tibetanmaster who disagrees with the statement that the scriptures in unison declarethat human life begins at conception. I would also be surprised to hear of anyTibetan master (male or female) who would give their assent to the terminationof a child he or she had a part in conceiving. Anecdotally, I have known mastersoffering to adopt as-yet unborn but inconvenient children whose parentscontemplated abortion. One example of this can be seen in the movie Sky Dancer,a documentary on the subject of the master Kunzang Wangmo (since deceased),during which she offers to adopt an unborn child even though doctors haveinformed the parents that the child will be born handicapped. She does nothingto add to the parents’ woes, but the viewer senses her alarm at the thought ofthe child’s premature demise: she wants to help everyone involved, the futurechild included.In a single sentence: Buddhist texts, and traditional masters, are explicitly,unequivocally against deliberate termination of a pregnancy from the firstinstant of conception.Yet that is but one side of the story. In practice, masters in our timesencourage their disciples to refrain from any act that harms others or abusestheir own body or mind. There are many, many aspects of modern life and modernbelief systems that our masters would gladly wish away, and such tragedies assuicide, depression, and drug addiction number among the most challenging forspiritual teachers called to assist. By comparison, counseling women or coupleswho have chosen to end pregnancies seems to pose few problems for Tibetan lamas:they see their role as offerers of solace during a very difficult moment. No onewelcomes an abortion; there is more than enough pain to share. I have neverpersonally seen or heard of a Tibetan master scolding a woman after an abortion;I have seen them do their best to help in the healing process, which does notinclude lectures, large or small, on karma. I was with a leader of one of theKagyu lineages when a disciple regretted to him two abortions she’d had (she wasa lifelong Buddhist). He replied, “Do you know how many deer I’ve hit and killedwhile driving?” The message: there’s much that’s wrong with much of our life,many ways in which grievous harm is inflicted on others in our name, all ofwhich amounts to our incarnation’s collateral damage. It’s excellent toacknowledge that even the most benign aspects of our common lives—the clothes wewear, for instance—have come to us accompanied by enormous hardships. OneBuddhist writer of the past estimated that each cup of tea we drink is heavywith such unintended but terrible suffering: insects killed in planting,cultivation, and harvesting; animals killed and people displaced to create theroads and buildings for the tea’s transportation, packaging, storage, and sale;and the misery of workers at every stage between the tea fields and our homes,most of whom toil for next to nothing in conditions we could not long bear.38[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st38] As it is with a simple cup of tea, so it is withthe whole gamut of things we acquire to consume or possess. When we calculatehow many insects died in the production of even a bowlful of grains, “the numberof beings killed is incalculable. If you think about it, it is almost as if weare eating powdered insects.”39 [29_endnote-title.html#ch_st39] So it is evenwith our physical presence on this earth: we immensely powerful humans liveabove all in this world, yet our position is only maintained by the functioningof large and small life-support systems to keep us here, safe and sound.40[29_endnote-title.html#ch_st40] Nonetheless, our eyes and our hearts are notsufficiently hard to closely examine those very systems. How many beings die,and in what ways, that we might live?I do not write these lines to suggest an excuse for anyone to act in any way,major or minor, that harms themselves or another. No, Buddhism does not condoneterminating pregnancy, nor does it condone life lived as circumstances force usto—everything is tainted, everything leads to suffering. There is no possiblehappy ending; there is not even an ending. Thus, among the many unsatisfactorychoices before us, suicide is absolutely the worst. Disenchanted anddisillusioned with the round of rebirth, we keep moving forward toward spiritualpractice, renewing our determination to do no harm and to attain enlightenmentfor the good of all. As our author wrote above, we have lived everywhere, beeneverything, and done everything. No ennobling act and no wrongdoing is foreignto our karmic résumé. Nothing worked: it’s time to use the exit door the Buddhaopens.BOOK 7: TAKING REFUGE AND THE LESSER WAYThe spiritual master and the three jewels give certain refuge from thesufferings of the round of rebirth in general, from the sufferings of miserableexistences in particular, and, temporarily, from all sufferings during thislife. With the thought that the three jewels thus constitute a specialsanctuary, you should take refuge in them. Nothing has more powerful or rapidmiraculous power than these jewels; therefore, whether you are happy or sad, youshould think of nothing besides the precious master and the jewels. You shouldhave such trust as the thought, “Whether you send me aloft or throw me down,enfold me in your wisdom mind.” You should have the thought, “I am happy that mytrust in the three jewels is not mistaken.”Since all comfort and happiness surely come from offerings made to the threejewels, and since all we want is comfort and happiness, we should always fosterdiligence in making offerings to the three jewels. If we offer half of our foodand wealth to the three jewels, accomplishments will surely fall to us likerain. At the six times of the day and night, following the custom ofcontemplative practice, you should offer such articles as water, flowers,incense, lamps, and food to the three jewels and take refuge in them.Persons of limited intelligence pray from the bottom of their hearts to regionalgods, local deities, or worldly gods, and they place their trust in such mundanegods. If we pray in the same way to the three jewels, it is certain our wisheswill be spontaneously accomplished. We should think, “Even if I trust thislife’s rulers or worldly gods, that attitude does not help me: why should Icontinue to do so?” When you have a place of refuge in the three jewels, moreprecious than a wish-fulfilling gem, what need is there to put your hopes inthis life’s rulers? You don’t need to expect for your happiness to come from anyhuman being: whatever wish you harbor, you can ask the three jewels. They areall you need. They are never, ever angry; they are easy to approach; they haverapid miraculous power; they always protect you as their offspring, with greatlove; and they produce a rain of accomplishments.You don’t need to consider various schemes, “What can I do to make happinesscome to me? What can I do to avoid suffering?” Whether you want to gainhappiness or to avoid suffering, mere prayers to the three jewels willaccomplish your wishes. If you can trust the jewels, your inner attitude willdefinitely improve. What good can your acquaintances do? What good is there inapproaching false gods? The three jewels are free from all danger to themselvesand they can definitely provide others with refuge from all danger. If you havecontrol over your own mind, you should firmly accept the spiritual master andthe three jewels as your supreme refuge.Once your mind has turned to the sacred Buddhist doctrine, in order to cultivateevery positive ennobling act, you should sustain an appropriate physical,verbal, and mental discipline. The first of all Buddhist teachings is that ofthe fundamental ethical conduct of discipline. Ethical conduct is like theground: it must be firm. Those endowed with ethical conduct are honored andserved by those high and low in this life. It is impossible for those endowedwith ethical conduct to descend to miserable existences; they will be reborn asgods or as human beings. During those lifetimes, due to karmic resultsconsistent with the karma of previous acts, they will once again exertthemselves in sustaining ethical conduct and will eventually attain freedom andomniscience. Those whose acts are inconsistent with ethical conduct will, evenin this lifetime, endure a rain of many unwanted sufferings and, in the nextlife, take rebirth in miserable existences.The exalted hearers and solitary sages take pure ethical conduct as the basis oftheir spiritual lives and meditate on the thirty-seven facets of awakening. Theypermanently overcome their evil foes—the eighty-four thousand mentalafflictions, source of every suffering in the round of rebirth. Thus they neverneed to experience the round of rebirth’s sufferings; they attain the holysanctuary of happiness and freedom.These days, those with a limited outlook consider as quite inferior individualswho say they follow the lesser way. This betrays a lack of understanding of thedoctrine. Those of us who only work for this life’s happiness are ordinaryindividuals. Such activity as ours does not carry much significance. Althoughthe lesser way cannot produce prodigious acts for the welfare of others, yet inwhatever way it can, it accomplishes much for others’ benefit. As for us, wholive mundane lives, not only can we not accomplish others’ welfare, we can’teven accomplish our own, either for this life or for the next. Whatever we’vedone is a means to be miserable now and to continue our misery in the future.Since we’re so unskillful, it is very important that we turn our minds towardtaking refuge and toward the lesser and middle ways of Buddhist spiritualdevelopment.—Choying Tobden DorjeWithin northern Asian Buddhism, and the Tibetan tradition in particular, the“lesser way” suffers from poor branding: it’s forever the lesser, the smaller,the lower. To a degree, those adjectives reflect a certain reality. When thegreat way spirit of universal altruism ignites within us, and we embrace thebodhisattva ideal as best we can, all other religious quests seem petty, allother truths seem limited and uninspired. Yet the wellsprings of Buddhism arefound in this so-called lesser way; its attitudes, customs, teaching, andterminology are woven inextricably into the fabric of the great way.Book 7 affords us a glimpse into the legal code of the Buddhist community, theway it has been since the Buddha established it. The rules for ordainedindividuals and procedures for the community were determined by the Buddha.Every single aspect of deportment, down to table manners and how to walk or sit,reflect the Buddha’s intent. How wonderful and incredible to have this windowonto a functioning spiritual community founded over 2,500 years ago. Yes, theserules pertain to just the monks—or nuns, whose rules are even more numerous—andour author does not provide many details on the community procedures, yet Ithink all Buddhists should take the time to read the second chapter of Book 7,to gain some appreciation (hopefully!) of Buddhism on the ground floor.Nuns and monks of yore renounced the mundane cares and concerns of life andentered a discipline of conscientious dignity, simplicity, and integrity. Hasanything changed in the present day? How are we to understand the shaven-headedwomen and men in maroon robes who are today’srenunciants-with-cellphones/computers/email accounts? Our author does notdiscuss in Book 7 the subject of the three codes of conduct in Tibetan Buddhism:individual liberation, bodhisattva training, and tantric bonds. At the veryleast, what we can guess when we meet modern adult monks or nuns in the Tibetantradition is that they were most likely inspired by the same elements ofBuddhist practice that touch us: the bodhisattva ideal and the path of tantra.Most of the monks and nuns we meet (be they Asian or Western) are anything butsolemn, grey characters. They are most often cheerful, carefree, joyous,inspired, and inspiring. While there may be a few who are dedicated exclusivelyto the straight and narrow of the lesser way, the vast majority use theconstraints of the lesser way’s rules to impose a simplicity on their lives sothey can devote themselves entirely to Buddhism’s higher calling—the great wayand the way of secret mantra.Most of the preeminent masters of India and Tibet reached high levels ofspiritual accomplishment by adhering impeccably to the lesser way rules in theirphysical and verbal deportment, infusing their hearts with the universalcompassion and insight into emptiness of the bodhisattva, and immersing theirminds in the nondual wisdom of bliss-emptiness of the tantras. Our modernfriends who have taken the plunge into the renunciant community are followingthis very same well-trod, noble path. What we all share as persons who havetaken refuge in the three jewels (and specifically, refuge in Buddhist scriptureand realization) is a commitment to not do anything to harm any sentient being.The basic code for nonviolent behavior is called the four guidelines ofennobling training: to not respond to anger with anger, to verbal abuse withverbal abuse, to blows with blows, or to criticism with criticism. This at theleast is the path common to all Buddhists.One of the exciting tasks for me in this book was to translate the list of allBuddhist canonical discourses, which begins here in Book 7 and continues in Book8. Of course, we don’t learn much of anything by just perusing such a litany oftitles, but I still find it inspiring to see these, our most sacred texts,listed together in English as they are in Asian languages. Yet, here they allare, surprisingly for the first time in print in a Western language.A word of caution: I assume that one reason that scholars have not previouslytranslated this kind of list is that while the titles were set in stone in AsianBuddhist languages (Tibetan, Sanskrit, Chinese, and so on) a thousand or moreyears ago, no reliable equivalent exists at this early infant stage of Westernlanguage translation. A single canonical text can have already undergone anumber of translations, each bearing a different title. It may be centuriesbefore the gold dust settles and some conventions become widespread andaccepted. That is to say, in that still far-off time when English itself becomesa Buddhist language.We are extremely fortunate that all the canon’s sacred texts are in the processof translation thanks to the incredible work of the group laboring for a projectcalled 84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha. The list appearing here andin Book 8 amounts to a mere menu of items that we will soon be able to savor intheir entirety at our leisure.BOOK 8: THE FOUNDATION OF THE MIDDLE WAYThroughout previous lifetimes from time immemorial, we have only servedourselves. Thereby, we have not helped others, nor have we succeeded in our owngoals. Our attitudes have been faulty and, until now, we have only beentormented with suffering. To be here, suffering endlessly along with allsentient beings, is the reward for having served ourselves alone. We are nowdestitute due to our negative attitude toward these sentient beings, to havingadvised them badly, and to having acted badly—negative, self-centered acts. Ifour flesh and bones from past lives were gathered, they would equal the worldlyrealm—the reward for our self-centeredness. Our heads cut off in past liveswould reach the world of Brahma—the fault of our self-centeredness. If our mucusand blood shed in past lives were gathered, they would equal an ocean—the flawof negative, self-centered acts.From this day forward, we should do what helps ourselves and others, what bringscontinual happiness and comfort in every time and circumstance—we should thinkof helping others. We should develop enthusiasm toward any means to foster inour stream of being the thought of helping others, like a wish-fulfilling jewel.There is no sentient being who has not been our parent, yet these kind pastparents of ours now wander in dismal ignorance within the six kinds of life inthe round of rebirth. They are afflicted by great blazing flames of anger,carried away by the wide rivers of desire, disoriented by winds of jealousy,oppressed by mountains of pride, and bound by iron chains of greed. Theyassiduously plant only the seeds of corrupting wrongdoing and continuallyharvest only the causes of the experience of unbearable suffering, their lot.How sad!They don’t understand correct conduct: that they should undertake ennobling actsand reject evil acts. Thus, we must in every time and circumstance strive tocreate the conditions in various ways to lead them to the causes of help andhappiness. Since the best way to help them is to have their minds turn towardthe sacred doctrine spoken by wisdom beings, we must do whatever we can tochange their attitude. If they understand the meaning of the teachings, that theresult of corrupting wrongdoing is suffering, they will surely turn away fromcorrupting conduct. When their minds turn away from wrongdoing, they will nolonger commit corrupting acts. Once they do not accumulate bad karma, they willnever experience its result, suffering. When they listen to the precious, sacreddoctrine, their minds naturally turn to the practice of ennobling acts. Oncetheir minds turn toward ennobling acts, their character will be diligent in thepractice of them. The effect of diligence in ennobling acts can only behappiness.Giving the sacred doctrine is very important as means for sentient beings tobecome happy and to have the causes of happiness, and for them to become free ofsuffering and its causes. Therefore, as a means for sentient beings’ happiness,we must spread the sacred doctrine of the Buddha’s precious teaching. If thedoctrine flourishes, sentient beings will surely be happy. To be a great help tosentient beings, we will listen to an ocean of the Buddhist doctrine’s sacredteachings. We will cut through the nets of our doubts through reflection, andonce we have merged our minds with the teachings through meditation, we willgain confidence through experience and realization. To do so, we will practicethe teachings. Since we use this support of our bodies to accomplish others’welfare, whatever food, clothing, or wealth we have, whatever we do, wediligently act with our bodies, express with our voices, and keep in mind onlythe spread of the Buddha’s precious doctrine and the means for the happiness ofsentient beings.Each act that you do for others’ welfare and each altruistic thought you haveincreases the goodness of your store of ennobling acts to a degree equal to thealtruistic attitude you have. Compared to long eons of ennobling acts done foryour own good, an instant of ennobling acts for others’ good is more beneficial.When hearing the sacred doctrine, reflecting on it, and meditating on it; whenasking questions, reciting texts, or reading; when painting wisdom deities orerecting sacred representations of wisdom; when presenting offerings to thejewels; when giving gifts to those less fortunate; or when keeping the pledgesand vows of your training, if you do these things with only the thought ofhelping other beings, this is what is called “the great way’s awakened mind.”Those acts constitute the conduct of the heirs of the great way’s victoriousbuddhas.When your mind is given over to others’ good, all that you doconsists of positive ennobling acts. Should you perform ennobling acts solelyfor your own good, this is a false reflection of true ennobling acts. At alltimes, consider the flaws of self-centered acts and consider the positivequalities of acts done in altruism. The main part of your experientialcultivation should be meditation solely on the altruistic attitude of the greatway’s awakened mind. In meditation, count the number of your altruisticthoughts. When you eat, look to see whether or not you’re guided by altruisticthoughts. When you move, look to see whether or not you’re moving toward analtruistic attitude. Whatever you’ve done, look to see whether or not you’vebeen motivated by altruistic thoughts. Ensure that you’re a person who hasmerged your mind with an altruistic attitude.To encourage others’ minds to engage diligently in altruism, listen to and teachthe sacred doctrine. Create many skillful ways for others’ minds to surely turnto the sacred doctrine. You have stored up this wish-granting gem of the sacreddoctrine. Should you give it to others, it produces a wealth of lastinghappiness for yourself and others.Mental ennobling acts are more powerful than physical or verbal ennobling acts.Everyone says you should have a good attitude, but they don’t know what it is.“A good attitude” is an altruistic attitude: it is very important to ensure thateveryone takes this into their stream of being.—Choying Tobden DorjeTranslators probably shouldn’t play favorites, but if I were asked to choose oneof the books from this volume as a must-read, this would be it.One crucial subject of Book 8 is referred to as “ultimate truth”—ourenlightened, or “buddha,” nature. In Book 5, our author informed us thattremendous amounts of ennobling acts, good karma, lead not to enlightenment butto pleasant lives within the round of rebirth, culminating in a state ofmeditative composure at the very pinnacle of existence. In Book 6, he said thatthis state amounted to nothing more than the highest echelon of a prison, aseemingly boundless golden cage. Book 7 laid out one approach to gaining releasefrom the entire prison, high and low: insight into the absence of an intrinsicself after having adopted a lifestyle that starves the machinery of suffering ofits fuel—the false sense of self and attachment to it. This path based on theBuddha’s four truths is excellent, impeccable, and selfless, in all senses ofthe word.Now, however, we find a description of the ultimate truth according to the greatway—buddha nature—a subject unmentioned in Book 7. Our author provides us with awealth of synonyms for buddha nature, two of which appear often in this chapter:enlightened heritage (Tib. “rik,” rigs; not the same as “rik-pa”) and innateconstituent enlightenment (“kam,” khams). Remarkably, at the end of the firstsection that elucidates these subjects, he admits that their nature, our nature,is paradoxical and unfathomable—“inconceivable” in his wording. This admissionalso marks a great divide between the lesser and great ways: we’ve now enteredterritory that is hazardous to the rational mind, and things get worse as weproceed. (Think, for example: “Form is emptiness and emptiness is form. There isno other form than emptiness and no emptiness other than form.”) As far asBuddhism goes, we basically have to check our belief in solid, material realityat the entrance to the great way.I find it interesting that our author turns the graded path on its head, andbegins at its apex—ultimate truth—then descends to thirty-four tales of theBuddha’s past lives. These charming stories are meant to instruct us how we canmodel our behavior after the same bodhisattva, in lifetimes as a god, a human,or an animal, whose courageous deeds on the spiritual path ended in hisenlightenment as Buddha Shakyamuni. These tales are meant to answer ourquestions concerning predicaments we encounter in our own lives: how should weact? These are seemingly gentle stories, practically children’s tales, but attheir core lies a determination that is stronger than steel. At every juncture,the future Buddha sacrificed whatever was asked of him in order to continuemoving forward on the spiritual path. We hear the echo of these stories inChoying Tobden Dorje’s chilling logic: we’re going to die a million deathsanyway, most of them miserable and meaningless, due to the inevitable unfoldingof our wretched karma. Why are we so averse to making meaningful sacrifices whenthe opportunity arises?Book 8 ends with a ritual for uplifting our minds to awakening, thereby enteringthe path to the ultimate truth as understood in the great way. Here, andelsewhere in this book, I have translated jang-chub sem (Tibetan: byang chubsems; Sanskrit: bodhichitta) as “awakened mind” rather than “awakening mind” or“mind of awakening.” To my ears, the latter terms put the accent on states ofmind during the process of awakening. At what point in the text does the mind ofawakening become, finally, the awakened mind? In Tibetan (or Sanskrit), only oneword is used from beginning to end, and that word would be best rendered asawakened mind, or so I believe. Awakened mind expresses itself differently inspecific contexts (meditative, post-meditative, relative, ultimate, and so on)but apart from identifying those contexts with adjectives, there is no changemade in the term itself, which our author uses as a synonym for buddha nature.BOOK 9: THE PATH OF THE MIDDLE WAYYou should think this: “I will provide the means for my mothers, all sentientbeings, to have the happiness of the higher realms, freedom, and omniscience;and the causes of such happiness, ennobling acts; and the means for them to befree from the suffering of the round of rebirth’s miserable realms and thecauses of such suffering, corrupting acts. To be able to do this, I must attainenlightenment, to have no more faults and to become endowed with every positivequality. I must gather stores of goodness and wisdom, cause of the attainment ofenlightenment.”Motivated by such thoughts of the awakened mind, with others’ welfare in mind,you do such acts as to perform prostrations; present offerings; copy texts; givegifts of food and wealth; construct sacred representations of wisdom body,speech, and mind; protect others’ lives; memorize words of Buddhist teaching;explain their meaning to others; and eat food, wear clothes, walk, and sit. Allthese acts, guided by the profound means of altruistic supreme compassion,awakened mind, constitute a cause of enlightenment, the cultivation of goodness.The cultivation of wisdom is any ennobling act sealed with the profound sublimeinsight of emptiness—all appearing phenomena of the round of rebirth andtranscendent states are in fact naturally devoid of intrinsic reality, andtranscend all verbal or mental formulations. Ennobling acts, such asprostrations, offerings, or recitation of prayers, guided by the motivation ofothers’ welfare, the relative awakened mind—and equally guided by the ultimateawakened mind, emptiness—complete the integration of the two stores of goodnessand wisdom.To guide your acts by awakened mind in both ultimate andrelative contexts is very important. Ennobling acts guided by them constitutethe cause of enlightenment and gather what must be cultivated duringincalculable eons. Ennobling acts not guided by these two can result in rebirthin the higher realms and freedom, but not enlightenment. Without enlightenment,you cannot accomplish your own or others’ welfare. Attainment of enlightenmentdepends upon the cultivation of the two stores of goodness and wisdom. Suchcultivation depends upon your positive motivation. If you wish to uplift yourmind to awakening, approach a spiritual master who teaches the great way, andhear the source texts of the great way and reflect upon them. Once you have doneso, your meditation on the two forms of the awakened mind merges your hearingand reflection with your stream of being, and from that point on, thecultivation of the stores of goodness and wisdom will not present anydifficulty.There is no spiritual technique more profound than uplifting your mind toawakening. There is no sublime insight quicker than meditation on profoundemptiness. It is said that one instant of noncomposite virtue, profoundemptiness, is superior to the entire extent of composite ennobling acts of body,speech, and mind—generosity, ethical conduct, patience, diligence, andmeditative stability.In the doctrine’s middle cycle—in such texts as the lengthy, middle length, andabridged versions of The Perfection of Sublime Insight—emptiness alone isextensively praised. Therefore, understanding the ultimate awakened mind,profound emptiness, is extremely important. Uninterrupted clinging to reality asbeing substantial and possessed of intrinsic attributes has created the round ofrebirth. Ultimately, even the name of the round of rebirth does not exist. Lifein the round of rebirth has been created by holding what does not exist asexistent, and by holding what is not real as real. Freedom from dualisticclinging and its formulations is the middle way’s path. To believe that thingsexist is eternalism; to believe that they do not exist is nihilism. What is thepoint of such fixation? Train in not clinging.Although the spiritual practice of profound teachings presents no difficulty,torment by karma we’ve accumulated from time immemorial makes us disinclined tosuch practice. From now on, firmly turn your mind to the great way. Don’t searchfor food or wealth; accumulate the eternal food and wealth of the two stores ofgoodness and wisdom. Don’t transgress the Buddha’s stipulated bounds of ethicalconduct of restraint from faulty conduct; always train in the ethical conduct ofgathering ennobling qualities, the six transcendent perfections. Engage in theethical conduct of altruistic acts, by serving sentient beings widely throughthe four means of gathering disciples.Always cultivate goodness through four transcendent perfections—generosity,ethical conduct, patience, and meditative stability; cultivate wisdom bysettling in evenness within profound sublime insight, emptiness; and cultivatetheir common companion, diligence. All of these transcendent perfections shouldbe guided by the awakened mind. For example, you must train in the transcendentperfection of all-inclusive generosity: the substance and characteristics of theobject given, the giver, and the recipient of the gift do not exist. You shouldtrain in the transcendent perfection of generosity that has no set referencepoint. Since all clinging to reality as being substantial and possessed ofintrinsic characteristics becomes the cause of the round of rebirth, you mustcleanse yourself of this habit of clinging to reality as possessed of intrinsiccharacteristics and train in having no reference point in relation to what isinsubstantial and without intrinsic characteristics.The extent of your cultivation of goodness and wisdom depends upon the extent towhich an act has been guided by awakened mind. Like lead transformed into goldonce touched by an alchemical potion, any ennobling act guided by awakened mindwill become the cultivation of goodness. Any ennobling act should initially beundertaken with that sacred motivation. It should be guided by sacredall-inclusiveness during the act and guided by sacred dedication once complete.It is extremely important that these three (motivation, all-inclusiveness, anddedication) be present.If you don’t energetically grasp the means to traverse the path now, you willfind it difficult to free yourself later, having sunk in the seas of the roundof rebirth’s sufferings. Therefore, you should develop energetic application,day and night, in body, speech, and mind, to techniques to attain enlightenment.—Choying Tobden DorjeIn Book 8, at the conclusion of the accounts of thirty-four of the Buddha’s pastlives, our author slipped in a concise presentation of the four immeasurableaspirations, beginning with the one usually listed last, equanimity. His partingnote, before heading into the ritual for entering the bodhisattva path,concerned the importance of setting aside biased love and compassion to embracelove and compassion without regard to our personal feelings or affinities. Thisinjunction comes to mind when we read the code of conduct for bodhisattvas inthe first chapter of Book 9. Instead of the black and white of the monasticcode, the underlying message here is, “It’s complicated.” For those familiarwith Buddhism’s repeated pleas to us to forsake harmful acts, lines such asthese can startle: “If a specific act can be a means to help others, it ispermitted to commit the seven physical and verbal acts from among the tencorrupting acts rejected when you take vows to restrain from corruptingactivity.”This cannot be read as an invitation to do as we’ve always done: protectourselves and those people or possessions we cherish, or thwart the influence ofour enemies, all under some supposed pretext of “helping others.” This isperhaps why our author elected to include those practical instructions on love,compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity after the stories filled withexamples of the future Buddha’s sacrifice of his well-being, possessions,status, family, and even his own life. We understand that we need to be equippedwith more than a simple monastic rule book on the bodhisattva path. If ourobjective is enlightenment for the sake of all beings, when it comes to thegames of mundane life, we are always playing alongside the Buddha—for the losingside. As our author advises, we can’t even make a big deal of things that seembigger than ourselves, such as our identity as a loyal Buddhist and defender ofthe faith: “Don’t even become angry toward others for the sake of such as yourteacher, preceptor, spiritual master, or the three jewels. If you get angry, notonly will this not help them, this will cause very significant harm to you andothers now and in the future.”Conventional Buddhist wisdom has it that the monastic vows are much easier thanthe bodhisattva vows. Why? As we read in Book 9, although there are in fact somedos and don’ts that we can keep on a mental checklist, both the letter and thespirit of the bodhisattva training are located not in physical or verbal acts,or perceptible disciplines, but in the mind, the altruistic attitude stretchedfar beyond what we once imagined possible.Among the rules of the bodhisattva path, the very first vow for common people(that is, those of us who are not rulers or government officials) is surprising:to refrain from speaking “of emptiness to a sentient being who has no previousmental training.” This first of the fundamental downfalls for bodhisattvas, thecommission of which causes rebirth in the hells, reminds us of the later bondsof secrecy central to the tantric code of conduct.On the other hand, this book’s last chapter, on the paths and stages ofawakening, looks backward. That is to say, its framework of fourpaths—cultivation, application, seeing, and meditation—is lifted whole from thatof the lesser way detailed in Book 7. In the great way, there exists anincredible amount of literature on the subject of its own paths, and thischapter is a quick stroll through it. We note however that while many of thesignposts are the same as what we encountered in Book 7, what we find is quitedifferent. The same dilemma faces us when the same framework of paths istransposed on different dimensions of tantric practice, including great seal andgreat perfection: the language used, particularly when we consider its originalsetting, is wildly at odds with the new context. It’s as if the first map ofBuddhist spiritual progress was designed for solitary travel in a rowboat (thelesser way) and the same bearings are reused for journeys by air or in outerspace.We’ve read in Book 2 how maps and terminologies are lifted from a previous levelof theory and practice and resituated in another. As our author writes, “What iscalled the ‘general meaning’ is common to both discourses and secret mantra. Itincludes subjects explained in the general discourses of the way of thetranscendent perfections, such as awakening’s thirty-seven facets, five paths,and ten stages. Such subjects included in the category of general meaning aretaught to reassure those who entered the path of transcendent perfections andwho might otherwise feel regret that tantra is inconsistent with their path”(italics added). Using quotes from sacred texts, our author informs us that suchweaving of previous, lower paths’ terminology into that of a higher path is doneto “prevent remorse” or to avoid “antagonizing” those loyal to earlierapproaches. In other words, we’re witnesses to diplomacy as applied to Buddhistterminology. In practical terms, while we’re always given the sameencouragement, “Follow the yellow brick road!” (in other words, the paths ofcultivation, application, seeing, meditation, and no further training), roads ofthe same name can lead to very different destinations.Another issue one might have with the elaborate descriptions of awakening’spaths and stages according to the lesser or great way concerns the timenecessary to journey through them. The fact that, by the great way’s ownestimates, we will spend eons of lifetimes in this quest is not hidden in thefine print. Eons here, eons there, it all begins to add up—to at least threeincalculable eons, so claim even spokespersons of the great way itself. Thissystem of mapping the spiritual path is important in Buddhism: we are obliged tofamiliarize ourselves with it should we want to understand Buddhist theory. Yetit amounts to a detailed travel guide to destinations we will never be able toafford in this or many lifetimes, at least as advertised. Nonetheless, at leastthe descriptions have caught our attention. If we want to go to these far-offlands, we can only do so in our lifetime by taking a conveyance other than thegreat way—that of tantra.BOOK 10: THE RESULT OF THE MIDDLE WAYThe intense winds of the profound twofold cultivation of goodness and wisdomduring three incalculable eons clear away and totally purify the entire mass ofclouds of the incidental two obscurations’ deluded dualistic experience, alongwith their habitual patterns. Then the sun, the positive qualities of ourenlightened heritage or innate constituent enlightenment, buddhanature—enlightenment’s four bodies and five wisdoms, along with theiractivity—shines brilliantly in its natural luminosity, the full radiance of thepositive qualities of the wheel of inexhaustible ornaments of wisdom body,speech, and mind. This sacred state of victorious and transcendent perfectenlightenment, once attained, manifests continually in relation to sentientbeings’ dispositions, in whatever ways can appropriately guide them. Althoughthis activity continues until the end of the round of rebirth, apart from aself-manifest perception produced by the convergence of enlightenment’sblessings and sentient beings’ karmic perceptions, enlightenment’smanifestations do not move and wisdom speech has no expression, like the moon inspace that appears reflected in various containers of water. Through theblessings of these quiescent forms and ineffable speech, beings understand thesacred doctrine in many ways, according to their individual interests and intheir own languages. It is difficult for beings’ intellects to fathomenlightenment; thus they make such false affirmations as, “This much is theextent of enlightenment’s body, speech, mind, positive qualities, or activity!”Enlightenment has no such limits; it is inconceivable.This completes the presentation of the basis, path, and result of thecause-based transcendent perfections, the Buddhist way of philosophy free fromattachment. If your hearing every part of this path, and of reflection andmeditation upon it become truly effective, when you enter the profound practiceof secret mantra, it will surely prove to be a very rapid path. Small-mindedindividuals who enter the rapid path of secret mantra without having trainedtheir minds in the common path will surely find tantra to be a rapid path onlyto hell.The basis of tantra is the profound uplift of the mind to supreme awakening; itspath is the accumulation of supreme wisdom’s two stores of goodness and wisdom.Apart from considering tantra to be an especially exalted revision of the greatway path, do not regard tantra as a separate path in itself. Be constant in theappreciation of the identical intention of the discourses and the tantras bycultivating the experience of the path of the great way as it has been taught.Be sure to merge with your stream of being such teachings as diligence infar-reaching service for others by assiduous reflection on death, karma and itsconsequences, and so on. Stability is important, like the initial foundationupon which you begin to construct a building. If you verbally claim belief inthe great way but your conduct is indistinguishable from that of ordinarypersons, you are only deceiving yourself.It is not possible for practitioners of the great way to not serve Buddhism andbeings. Whatever they do is definitely for others’ welfare. There will never besuch a thing as a tantric practitioner who has not developed the great way’smotivation. Those who have entered tantra without that motivation are mistaken.The vajra way of secret mantra is the domain of individuals of very acutespiritual acumen, who have pure views, outstanding meditation, and exceptionalconduct. Such persons can enter tantra; it is wrong for tantra to be open tojust anyone.The nectar that helps everyone is the common path of the discourses. If you wantprofound teaching, meditate only on supreme compassion: you will therebycomplete great stores of goodness and wisdom and you will purify much wrongdoingand many obscurations. Precious compassion is so profound that very few personsmeditate on it. Very many persons recite mantras without understanding thenature of tantra. However many mantras they recite, they will not reachaccomplishment as described in the texts, their reward for not keeping thetantric bonds.If you don’t even know the rules for keeping the tantric bonds, you should giveup your high, empty talk of the view and your coarse tantric conduct, to devoteyourself to reflection on death, karma and its consequences, the flaws of theround of rebirth, and taking refuge. Train in the awakened mind. Act withserenity and self-restraint. Live in contentment, with few desires. Integrateyour spiritual experiential cultivation with your own mind. Make your human lifemeaningful. Have your thoughts and deeds conform to the Buddha’s word and to theadvice of your spiritual masters and guides. Don’t become distracted inmeaningless acts in thought, word, and deed. Wholeheartedly bring intense effortto what is meaningful. If you are mentally at ease at the time of death, youhave become wise. Therefore it is important that your hearing of the sacreddoctrine, your reflection, and your meditation upon it be in equal proportions.Most importantly, if you fall to the miserable realms, it is your mind thatfalls, or if you attain enlightenment, it is your mind that attainsenlightenment: meditation with your mind is crucial. Without meditation,enlightenment is impossible. Meditation frees you from the bonds that restrictyour stream of being. You must meditate.—Choying Tobden DorjeHere, our author ends all that he will share on the subject of the lesser andgreat ways in The Complete Nyingma Tradition with a plea for persons interestedin tantra to not excuse themselves from all that he has written to this point.Choying Tobden Dorje was a dedicated practitioner of tantra and of greatperfection, yet he saw those higher practices as necessarily anchored in thefundamental truths of the initial stages of the Buddhist spiritual path. As Imentioned earlier, why else has he dedicated separate books to elementarysubjects—such as death, impermanence, and karma—on the same level in the contextof this work as long commentaries to tantric meditations or profound subjects ofgreat perfection? It is true that the landscape of tantric practice is radicallydifferent from that of the great way, yet nonetheless, until our final exit fromdualistic experience into omniscient enlightenment, what we label “relative”truths, such as karma and its consequences, remain valid and very much ineffect.Our author has waited until this point to employ a common term for the great andlesser ways, to differentiate them from tantra: “cause-based.” That is to say,we tread the spiritual path in the belief that our ethical conduct, ourmeditation training, and our sublime insight are “causes” that will somedayculminate in awakening and enlightenment: cause and effect. We do the best thatour reasonable, rational mind can do, trusting that our efforts are furthering aprocess that will pay off one day, in three incalculable eons, to be exact. Andso, in fact, they will, as these books describe.In contrast to this approach, tantra is labeled “result-based.” Tantra beginswith the immediate, immersive experience of the result—enlightenmentitself—without it having been the effect of any process. The great way’sreasonable, rational, intelligent mind, however brilliant, is dualistic; tantrais rooted instead in nondual wisdom. Nevertheless, Choying Tobden Dorje seems tobe encouraging us to remember to keep our lesser way common sense and our greatway wits about us when we cross the pass into tantric territory in the latervolumes of this series."},{"pageContent":"NOTES [05_toc-title.html#head_34]image [images/chapline.jpg]1 [11_chapter-title-5.html#ch_en1].

This marks the last time in this chapter theauthor refers to the titles or subjects of these books as “great way”; from hereon, he consistently labels them with a term he seems to use interchangeably with“great way” in this context: “middle way.” In the books themselves, he does notoffer comparative definitions of the two terms.5 [14_chapter-title-7.html#ch_en5]. This information is also contained in TheGolden Key, the text the author mentions as contained in Volume 12. The GoldenKey appears in its entirety at the end of this translation.6 [15_chapter-title-8.html#ch_en6]. The seven treasures of exalted beings arefaith, ethical conduct, education, generosity, decency, conscience, and sublimeinsight.7 [15_chapter-title-8.html#ch_en7]. The ten forms of spiritual conduct arecopying texts, making offerings, giving gifts, listening to the doctrine,reading, memorization, teaching, recitation, reflecting on the meaning of thedoctrine, and meditation on the meaning of the doctrine.8 [16_chapter-title-9.html#ch_en8]. The three testaments were left by threefounding awareness holders of the great perfection teachings in the human world:Garab Dorje, Manjushrimitra, and Jnanasutra. Some include Shri Singha as afourth.9 [20_chapter-title-13.html#ch_en9]. At this point, the author informs Tibetanreaders that in his numbering system, saya, which can indicate either onemillion or ten million, “comes first,” meaning that its value is one million.10 [21_chapter-title-14.html#ch_en10]. Some acts, such as murder, are naturallynegative; others, such as eating after the noon meal, are prohibited within thecontext of vows designated by the Buddha.11 [21_chapter-title-14.html#ch_en11]. In the following list of texts, thesquare brackets contain, first, the number ascribed to the text in the mostrecent comparative edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon (bka’ ’gyur dpe bsdurma) (Beijing: China’s Tibetan Academic Press [krung go’i bod kyi shes rig dpeskrun khang], 2006–2009); and second, the number of pages the text spans in thatcollection, which is printed in large, Western-style volumes.12 [21_chapter-title-14.html#ch_en12].

After nineteen weeks of gestation, afetus is considered a human being; before that point, a human being in fetaldevelopment.19 [21_chapter-title-14.html#ch_en19]. These five are intent on desire, illwill, sleep and mental dullness, excitation or boredom, and doubt.20 [21_chapter-title-14.html#ch_en20]. To this point, the author’s descriptionof the solitary sage relates only to the first of their three kinds, therhinoceros-like solitary sage.21 [21_chapter-title-14.html#ch_en21]. Our author’s reference to the work tothis point constituting “the first volume of the common discourses” correspondsto his plan, announced above in his introduction, for the entire work to fitinto thirteen volumes. Among them, this first volume would be number three:“Volume 3, which resembles a universal monarch’s precious supreme horse,constitutes the first volume on the discourses from the extensive commentary.”22 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en22]. Our author did not provide a definitionfor the measure tsen, here rendered as vaguely as possible by “large unit.”23 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en23]. One chapter (bampo) contains threehundred verses (shloka); each verse contains four lines (in poetic verse) orthirty-two syllables (in prose).24 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en24]. As in Book 7, the numbers in brackets arethose assigned to the text in the most recent edition of the Tibetan Buddhistcanon, followed by the number of pages in that edition.25 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en25]. These were the only parts translated intoTibetan: according to the eighth Tai Situpa, Chökyi Jungné, the remainingchapters were lost in a fire at Nalanda University.26 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en26]. Again, the numbers in brackets are thoseassigned to the text in the most recent edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon,followed by the number of pages of the text in that edition.27 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en27]. This gives a hint of which edition of thecanon the author follows in these lists: only the Urga edition lists this textwith 301 sections.28 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en28]. The verses throughout this section on theBuddha’s past lives are found in Master Vira’s Thirty-Four Past Lives of theBuddha.29 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en29]. Indians and Tibetans see the image of therabbit, not a man, on the surface of the moon.30 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en30]. This is an autumn moonlight festival,honoring Kaumudi, wife of the moon.31 [22_chapter-title-15.html#ch_en31]. I have added the numbers on the left andthe corresponding metaphors to the right.32 [23_chapter-title-16.html#ch_en32]. The four guidelines of ennobling trainingare to not return anger with anger, to not return verbal abuse with verbalabuse, to not return blows with blows, and to not return criticism withcriticism.33 [23_chapter-title-16.html#ch_en33]. These eight are discussed in detail inthe next section, on sublime insight.34 [23_chapter-title-16.html#ch_en34]. Our culture’s version of a magician’s“awareness mantra” is abracadabra.35 [24_chapter-title-17.html#ch_en35]. The sixty-four mentioned here are the tenforces, the four forms of fearlessness, the eighteen unique qualities, and thethirty-two signs of physical perfection.36 [26_chapter-title-19.html#ch_en36]. These two names are uncommon ones for,respectively, Manjushri and Maitreya.37 [29_chapter-title-22.html#ch_en37]. Some Tibetan texts use the term“another’s spouse” to refer to persons who belong to the category of thoseunsuitable as sexual partners. Our author prefers instead “a partner claimed byanother,” that is, anyone in a monogamous relationship, whether or not thatstatus has been formalized by a public exchange of vows.38 [29_chapter-title-22.html#ch_en38]. See The Words of My Perfect Teacher, byPatrul Rinpoche: “When we think about the production and trade of such products,we can understand that even a single sip of tea cannot but contribute to [ourown] rebirth in the lower realms” (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1998, p. 80;words in square brackets added).39 [29_chapter-title-22.html#ch_en39]. Ibid., p. 102.40 [29_chapter-title-22.html#ch_en40]. Patrul Rinpoche again: “Some of us,thinking only of the specific act of killing with our own hands, might imaginethat we are innocent of ever having taken life. But to start with, there is noone, high or low, powerful or feeble, who is not guilty of having crushedcountless tiny insects underfoot while walking around. . . . So all of ushumans, in fact, spend our entire time taking life, like ogres” (ibid., pp.102–3)."},{"pageContent":"WORKS CITED BY THE AUTHOR [05_toc-title.html#head_35]image [images/chapline.jpg]Many texts were mentioned in this work—the entire contents of the canonpertaining to the lesser way and the great way, for instance.
