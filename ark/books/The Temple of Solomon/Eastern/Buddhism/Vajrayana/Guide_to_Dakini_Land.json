Originally given by Buddha Vajradhara within the Heruka Tantra, it is the supreme method to purify the environment, body, and mind. At Manjushri Institute in 1981, out of his inexhaustible great compassion, Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso gave a complete oral commentary of the instruction of Vajrayogini, having first granted the empowerments of Heruka and Vajrayogini to the students present. Now, so that the blessings of Buddha Vajra-yogini may be received by many beings throughout the world, Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has composed this book, Guide to Dakini Land, based on his original oral commentary. For his immeasurable kindness in revealing this precious instruction to us and composing this supreme text, we thank the author from the depths of our hearts. We pray that we may gain perfect realization of this instruction by putting his teachings into practice purely and energetically. We also thank all those who helped with the different stages of preparing the manuscript, including James Belither, Jackie Devis, Daniel Smith, Ruth Lister, Mariana Libano, Michael Gar-side, Hugh Clift, Lucy James, Helene Oester, Rita Christie, and Alison Ramsay, and our special thanks go to Gelong Thubten Gyatso for reviewing and completing the final editing. Through the merits created by this work, may all sentient beings achieve the state of Buddha Vajrayogini. ix Roy Tyson, Director Manjushri Institute May 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Editorial Note Throughout this book, technical details have been kept to a minimum, and we have adopted a simplified form of phonetics to facilitate easy pronunciation.

For this reason; out of his com-passion, Buddha Shakyamuni gave teachings at many levels, just as a skilful doctor administers a great variety of remedies to treat the many different types of sick people. For those who wish merely to attain human happiness, Buddha gave teachings revealing actions and their effects, or karma, and he taught moral discipline as their main practice. For those who wish to experience the permanent inner peace of liberation, or nirvana, for themselves alone, Buddha gave teachings on the faults of cyclic existence, and he taught the three higher trainings -training in higher moral discipline, training in higher concentration, and training in higher wisdom - as their main practice. For those who wish to attain the ulti-mate goal of full enlightenment, Buddha gave teachings on the development of great compassion and bodhichitta, and he taught the six perfections -the perfections of giving, moral discipline, patience, joyous effort, mental stabilization, and wisdom-as their main practice. All these teachings are open to anyone who wishes to study and practise them. The experi-ences that are gained from practising them are called the 'common spiritual paths'. Besides these teachings, Buddha also gave teachings on Tantra. These may be practised only by those who have received Tantric empowerments. The experiences gained by practising these teachings are called the 'uncommon spiritual paths'. In the Tantric teachings, Buddha revealed four classes of Tantra. The practices that are explained in this book, Guide to Dakini Land, are included within the highest of these, Highest Yoga Tantra. These practices are the very essence of Buddha's xi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Vajrayogini"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION teachings. They include special methods for preventing ordinary appearance and ordinary conception, special methods for pre-venting ordinary death, intermediate state, and rebirth, and uncommon methods for transforming all daily experiences into higher spiritual paths. By transforming ordinary experience in this way we can prevent many daily problems and swiftly attain the ultimate happiness of full enlightenment. The source of all the essential meanings contained in Guide to Dakini Land is Illuminating All Hidden Meanings (Tib. Be.don kun.siil), which is a precious commentary on the practice of Heruka and Vajrayogini Tantra composed by Je Tsongkhapa. Through the kindness of my root Guru, Kyabje Trijang Dorje-chang, I have had the opportunity to study and practise the instructions of Heruka and Vajrayogini. Now I have written this book as a special offering, mainly for western practitioners. In order to practise the instructions contained within this book, special inner conditions are required. First we should train in the common spiritual paths and then receive the empowerments of Heruka and Vajrayogini. Having received these empowerments, we should strive to maintain our vows and commitments purely. This book should not be read as if it were a magazine, nor should it be read by those harbouring disrespectful or negative thoughts towards Vajrayogini practice, or by those who have no faith in the instructions, or no intention of putting them into practice. However, if we have a pure motivation and read the entire book carefully, concentrating deeply on its meaning with-out rushing to finish it, we can achieve profound realizations of Buddhadharma. xiii Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Tharpaland January 1990"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Mandala of Vajrayogini"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Preliminary Explanation The commentary to the Highest Yoga Tantra practice of Vener-able Vajrayogini consists of a preliminary explanation, the main commentary to the generation and completion stages, and the dedication. The first of these, the preliminary explanation, has seven parts: 1 Generating a correct motivation 2 The origin and lineage of these instructions 3 The benefits of these instructions 4 Biographies of past Buddhist Masters who gained realizations through these instructions 5 The qualifications necessary for putting these instructions into practice 6 The four special causes of swift attainments 7 What are the outer and inner Pure Dakini Lands? GENERATING A CORRECT MOTIVATION These instructions concern the extraordinary spiritual path of Tantra, or Secret Mantra, which is the quickest and most pro-found method for attaining great enlightenment. We should rejoice in this precious opportunity to study these teachings which, if put into practice, can lead to full enlightenment within one short human life. However, studying these instructions will be truly meaningful only if our motivation is pure. If we read this book merely out of intellectual curiosity we will not experi-ence its real meaning. To receive the maximum benefit from these instructions, each time we study or practise them, we should begin by generating a pure, altruistic motivation. This 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND can be done by reciting the following prayer three times while concentrating on its meaning: I and all sentient beings, the migrators as extensive as space, from this time forth until we reach the essence of enlightenment, Go for refuge to,.the glorious, sacred Gurus, Go for refuge to the complete Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, Go for refuge to the sacred Dharmas, Go for refuge to the superior Sanghas. Then we should recite three times: Once I have attained the state of a complete Buddha, I shall free all sentient beings from the ocean of samsara's suffering and lead them to the bliss of full enlightenment. For this purpose I shall practise the stages of V ajrayogini' s path. THE ORIGIN AND LINEAGE OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS The two stages of the practice of Vajrayogini were originally taught by Buddha Vajradhara. Buddha Vajradhara manifested in the form of Heruka to expound the Root Tantra of Heruka, and it was in this Tantra that the practice of Vajrayogini was first explained. All the many lineages of instructions on Vajra-yogini can be traced back to this original revelation. Of these lineages, there are three that are most commonly practised: the Narokhacho, which was transmitted from Vajrayogini to Naropa; the Maitrikhacho, which was transmitted from Vajra-yogini to Maitripa; and the Indrakhacho, which was transmitted from Vajrayogini to Indrabodhi. This commentary on the generation and completion stages of the Highest Yoga Tantra practice of Vajrayogini is based on the instructions of the Naro-khacho lineage. 2"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION The origin of Heruka Tantra At one time this universe was controlled by the worldly deity Ishvara. His mandalas and lingams existed in many places in this world, the most important ones being in the Twenty-four Holy Places. Ishvara's followers sacrificed innumerable animals as offerings to him, and this pleased him greatly. In return he helped them to achieve wealth and worldly success, but he interfered with anyone who tried to achieve liberation or enlightenment. Under the influence of Ishvara, the people of this world slaughtered thousands of animals every day thinking that they were performing virtuous actions. In reality, however, they were only creating heavy negative karma and depriving themselves of the opportunity to achieve liberation. The Heroes and Heroines of the five Buddha Families were unable to tolerate this and asked Buddha Vajradhara to inter-vene. In response, Buddha Vajradhara manifested in the form of Heruka and, through the power of his blessings, subdued Ishvara and transformed Ishvara' s mandalas into his own. The other Deities of Heruka's mandala subdued Ishvara's retinue by converting them to followers of Heruka. Heruka di.d not reabsorb the mandalas that he had emanated in the Twenty-four Places but left them intact, and to this day beings with especially pure karma are able to see these man-dalas and the Heroes and Heroines who abide within them. For practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini, these blessed places are particularly powerful sites for meditation. After subduing Ishvara and his retinue, Heruka expounded his condensed, middling, and extensive root Tantras. Of these only the Condensed Root Tantra of Heruka has been translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan. Buddha Vajradhara also gave many explanatory Tantras which are commentaries to the root Tan-tras, and a number of these have been translated into Tibetan. It is in these· root and explanatory Tantras, especially in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth chapters of the fifty-one chapters of the Condensed Root Tantra of Heruka, that Buddha Vajradhara gives clear instructions on the practice of Vajrayogini. 3"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND The lineage of these instructions The first Guru in the lineage of these instructions is Buddha Vajradharma, and the second is Buddha Vajrayogini. Vajra-yogini transmitted these instructions directly to Naropa who diligently put them into practice and, as a result, attained great realizations. Although Naropa had many disciples, he kept his practice of Vajrayogini secret, transmitting it only to two brothers from the Nepalese town of Pamting, now called Pharping. He recognized that the Pamtingpa brothers, Jigme Dragpa and his younger brother Ngawang Dragpa, had a particularly strong karmic con-nection with these instructions. Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsan and other famous Teachers have remarked on the fact that even Naropa's most famous disciple, the great Tibetan Master Marpa, did not receive these teachings. The Pamtingpa brothers passed these instructions on to the Tibetan translators Lokya Sherab Tseg and Malgyur Lotsawa. It was Malgyur Lotsawa who translated the Condensed Root Tantra of Heruka from Sanskrit into Tibetan. Through his kind-ness many Tibetans in the past became great Yogis and Yoginis, and today many people have the opportunity to study and practise Heruka and Vajrayogini Tantras. Malgyur Lotsawa himself reached the supreme Union of Vajradhara and attained Pure Dakini Land in that life. From Malgyur Lotsawa these instructions were passed down in unbroken succession to Phabongkha Rinpoche, and then to the most Venerable Kyabje Trijang Dorjechang, Holder of the Lineage. It was from this great Master that I, the author, received these instructions. From Buddha Vajradharma to Kyabje Trijang Dorjechang there have been thirty-seven lineage Gurus. The lineage of these instructions is unbroken and the blessings passed down from Buddha Vajradharma are intact. Each lineage Guru achieved complete experience of these instructions, thereby ensuring that their power has not decreased. These instructions are com-pletely authentic and are clearly presented. If we put them into practice with deep conviction and joyous effort, we will definitely achieve realizations. 4"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION THE BENEFITS OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS It is said in the Condensed Root Tantra of Heruka that the benefits to be gained from engaging in the practice of Vajrayogini are limitless, and that a thousand voices could never fully enumer-ate them. Here we shall consider ten principal benefits: By practising these instructions we quickly receive great and powerful blessings When we practise these instructions, we swiftly receive great and profound blessings from all the Buddhas. These blessings help us temporally, and eventually they enable us to achieve the ultimate goal of full enlightenment. These instruCtions are a synthesis of all essential instructions The instructions on the practice of Vajrayogini are a synthesis of all the essential instructions contained in the Tantras of Heruka, Yamantaka, and Guhyasamaja. All the essential points of the stages of Secret Mantra are included within the practice of Vajrayogini. These instructions are easy to practise The instructions on the practice of Vajrayogini contain concise and clearly presented meditations that are rellatively easy to practise. The mantra is short and easy to recite, and the visualizations of the mandala, the Deity, and the body mandala are simple when compared with those of other Highest Yoga Tantra Deities. Even those with limited abilities and little wisdom can engage in these practices without great difficulty. 5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND By practising these instructions we can swiftly achieve attainments Many great Teachers such as Kyabje Trijang Dorjechang have said that through the practice of Vajrayogini those with only middling fortune can attain Pure Dakini Land in one lifetime. Those with greater fortune will attain this with ease, and even those with lesser fortune can attain Pure Dakini Land in the intermediate state between death and rebirth. If we continually recite Vajrayogini's mantra while we are alive, we will remem-ber her mantra when we are dying. Then, as if in a dream, we will hear Vajrayogini and her retinue of Dakinis calling us and inviting us to her Pure Land. In this way Vajrayogini will guide us through death and the intermediate state and lead us to the Pure Land of the Dakinis. It is said that even those with the least fortune who do not attain Pure Dakini Land in the intermediate state will be led by Vajrayogini to her Pure Land within seven lives. Even if such practitioners find themselves in the deepest hell, Vajrayogini will bless their minds and cause their previously accumulated virtuous actions to ripen. In this way they will be released from hell and guided directly to the Pure Land of the Dakinis. Thus, through keeping our commitments purely and practis-ing these instructions sincerely, we can attain Pure Dakini Land in this life, in the intermediate state, or certainly within seven lives. These instructions include a special body mandala practice Body mandalas are not included within all Deity practices. A practice that contains a body mandala is more profound than one that does not, and the most profound of all body mandalas is that of Vajrayogini. 6"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION These instructions include an uncommon yoga of inconceivability The uncommon yoga of inconceivability is a special method, unique to the practice of Vajrayogini, whereby Pure Dakini Land can be attained within this life without abandoning our present body. Both generation and completion stages can be practised together In practices such as Yamantaka and Guhyasamaja, practitioners can meditate on completion stage only after they have gained experience of generation stage. In the practice of Vajrayogini, however, we can train in completion stage meditations, and even achieve certain completion stage realizations, while we are still training in generation stage. These instructions are espeCially suitable torJJtose with strong desirous attachment In general, it is difficult for those with strong desirous attach-ment to practise Dharma, but this is not so with the practice of Vajrayogini. Throughout this world there exist countless em-anations of Heruka and Vajrayogini manifesting as ordinary men and women. These emanations help pure practitioners of Vajrayogini to transform their desirous attachment into the spiritual path. If such practitioners conscientiously keep their commitments and faithfully practise the eleven yogas, eventu-ally they will meet an emanation of Vajrayogini manifesting as an attractive man or woman. By arousing desirous attachment in the practitioner, that emanation will bless their channels, winds, and drops. Then, by entering into union with the em-anation, the practitioner will be able to transform his or her desire into spontaneous great bliss. With this blissful mind the practitioner will meditate on emptiness and eventually eradicate all delusions, including desirous attachment. In this way they 7"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND will swiftly attain full enlightenment. Just as fire that is pro-duced from wood eventually consumes the wood that produced it, so too Tantric bliss, which is developed from desirous attach-ment, eventually consumes the desirous attachment that gave rise to it. This skilful method of transforming attachment into the spiritual path was adopted by Masters such as Ghantapa and Tilopa. The essence of Highest Yoga Tantra practice is to generate a mind of spontaneous great bliss and use that blissful mind to meditate on emptiness. The mind of spontaneous great bliss is attained by gathering the inner winds into the central channel through completion stage meditation. For completion stage meditation to be successful, the channels, winds, and drops of our body must be blessed by Deities. This is achieved through generation stage practice. These instructions are particularly appropriate for this degenerate age The practice of Vajrayogini quickly brings blessings, especially during this spiritually degenerate age. It is said that as the general level of spirituality decreases it becomes more difficult for practitioners to receive the blessings of other Deities, but the opposite is the case with Heruka and Vajrayogini; the more times degenerate, the more easily practitioners can receive their blessings. Whenever Vajradhara expounded a Tantra he emanated the mandala associated with it, but after completing the discourse he would usually reabsorb the mandala. For example, when he expounded the Root Tantra of Kalachakra, Vajradhara emanated the Kalachakra mandala and, when he had finished, he re-absorbed it. However, Vajradhara did not reabsorb the man-dalas of Heruka or Vajrayogini. These mandalas still exist at various places throughout this world such as in the Twenty-four Holy Places. Because of this, human beings in this world have a special relationship with Heruka and Vajrayogini and can quickly receive their blessings. Furthermore, in the Root Tantra of Heruka Vajradhara promised that in the future, when 8"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION times became spiritually degenerate, Heruka and Vajrayogini would bestow their blessings on those with strong attachment. In general, as the number of lineage Gurus of a Deity's prac-tice increases, the blessings of that Deity take J.onger to reach practitioners, but the greater the number of lineage Gurus of Heruka and Vajrayogini, the more quickly practitioners receive their blessings. Vajrayogini's mantra has many special qualities In the Root Tantra of Heruka it says that attainments can be gained merely by reciting Vajrayogini's mantra, even with poor concentration. Nowadays this is not possible when reciting the mantras of other Deities. However, we need to have very strong conviction and faith in Vajrayogini and her mantra if we are to achieve realizations by mantra recitation alone. If we think deeply about the benefits and special qualities of these instructions, we will realize that we now have a very precious opportunity to study and practise them. We will gener-ate a feeling of great joy which will give us great confidence in the instructions and encourage us to put them into practice. BIOGRAPHIES OF PAST BUDDHIST MASTERS WHO GAINED REALIZATIONS .THROUGH THESE INSTRUCTIONS Many people have achieved the highest attainments through Vajrayogini practice. Of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas of ancient India, many gained their attainments through the practices of Heruka and Vajrayogini, and since the time that these Tantras were introduced into Tibet many Tibetans have also attained similar realizations. It is still possible to emulate these Masters and gain the same attainments. There now follow brief biographies of five great practitioners who received special care and guidance from Vajrayogini and, as a result, reached Pure Dakini Land. 9"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Luyipa Luyipa was a great Indian Mahasiddha who relied on Heruka and Vajrayogini. One day, on the tenth day of the month, he went to a charnel ground to meditate, but when he arrived he saw a group of men and women having a picnic. A woman gave him a piece of meat and, through eating it, his mind was blessed and instantly purified of ordinary appearance. He attained a vision of Heruka and Vajrayogini and realized that the men and women were in reality Heroes and Heroines. His previous pure practice of Vajrayogini had caused Vajrayogini to manifest as th~ woman who offered him the meat. In this way Vajrayogini helped him to attain.both outer and inner Pure Dakini Land. Ghantapa The Mahasiddha Ghantapa lived deep in a forest in Odivisha (present-day Orissa), in India, where he engaged in intensive meditation on Heruka and Vajrayogini. Since he was living in such an isolated place his diet was poor and his body became emaciated. One day the king of Odivisha was out hunting in the forest when he came upon Ghantapa. Seeing how: thin and weak he was, the king asked Ghantapa why he lived in the forest on such a poor diet. The king encouraged Ghantapa to return with him to the city where he would give him food and shelter. Ghantapa replied that just as a great elephant could not be led from the forest by a fine thread, so he could not be tempted to leave the forest by the riches of a king. Angered by Ghantapa' s refusal, the king returned to his palace threatening revenge on him. Such was the king' s anger that he summoned a number of women from the city and told them of the arrogant monk in the forest. He offered great wealth to any one of th~m who could seduce the monk and force him to break his vows of celibacy. One woman, a wine-seller, boasted that she could do this and set out for the forest to look for Ghantapa. When she eventually found him she asked if she could become his servant. 10"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"PRELIMINA~Y EXPLANATION Ghantapa had no need of a servant but he realized that they had a strong relationship from previous lives and so he allowed her to stay. Ghantapa gave her spiritual instructions and empowerments and they engaged earnestly in meditation. After twelve years they both attained the Union of No More Learning, full enlightenment. One day, Ghantapa and the former wine-seller decided to encourage the people of the city to develop a greater interest in Dharma. Accordingly, the woman returned to the king and reported that she had seduced the monk. At first the king doubted the truth of her story, but when she explained that she and Ghantapa now had two children, a son and a daughter, the king was delighted with this news and told her to bring Ghantapa to the city on a particular day. He then issued a proclamation disparaging Ghantapa and ordered his subjects to assemble on the appointed day to insult and humiliate the monk. On the specified day, Ghantapa and the woman left the forest with their children, the son on Ghantapa' s right and the daugh-ter on his left. When they arrived at the city, Ghantapa was walking as if he were drunk, holding a bowl into which the woman poured wine. All the people who had gathered laughed and jeered, and hurled abuse and insults at him. 'Long ago', they taunted him, 'our king invited you to the city but you arrogantly refused his invitation. Now you come drunk and with a wine-seller. What a bad example of a Buddhist and a monk!' When they had finished, Ghantapa appeared to become angry and threw his bowl to the ground. The bowl sank into the earth, splitting the ground and causing a spring of water to appear. Ghantapa immediately transformed into Heruka arid the woman transformed into Vajrayogini. The boy transformed into a vajra which Ghantapa held in his right hand, and the girl transformed into a bell which he held in his left hand. Ghantapa and his consort then embraced and flew into the sky. The people were astonished and immediately developed deep regret for their disrespect. They prostrated to Ghantapa, beg-ging him and the emanation of Vajrayogini to return. Ghantapa and his consort refused, but told the people that if their regret was sincere they should make confession to Mahakaruna, the 11"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND embodiment of Buddha's great compassion. Through the deep remorse of the people of Odivisha and the force of their prayers, a statue of Mahakaruna arose from the spring water. The people of Odivisha became very devoted Dharma practitioners and many of them attained realizations. The statue of Mahakaruna can still be seen today. Because of Ghantapa' s pure practice of Heruka and Vajra-yogini in the forest, Vajrayogini saw that it was the right time for him to receive her blessings, and so she manifested as the wine-seller. Through living with her, Ghantapa attained the state of Pure Dakini Land. Darikapa King Darikapa was another of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas. He received empowerments and instructions on Heruka and Vajrayogini from Luyipa: Luyipa predicted that if Darikapa were to abandon his kingdom and apply great effort in the practice of Vajrayogini and Heruka, he would swiftly achieve enlightenment. Darikapa immediately left his palace and wan-_dered from place to place as a beggar, practising meditation at every opportunity. In a city in South ~ndia he met a wealthy courtesan who was an emanation of Vajrayogini. This woman owned a large mansion in which he worked as her servant for twelve years. During the day he performed menial tasks in and around the house and at night he practised Luyipa' s instruc-tions. After twelve years he attained the fifth stage of com-pletion stage, the Union that Needs Learning. It is said that Darikapa and the courtesan's entire entourage of fourteen thou-sand all attained Pure Dakini Land. In this way Darikapa received the guidance of Vajrayogini. Kusali A novice monk called Kusali also came under Vajrayogini' s care. One day, while travelling along the banks of the River Ganges, he met an old leper woman in great pain who wanted 12"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION to ct:oss the river. Kusali was overcome with compassion for the woman. He bound her onto his back with his upper garment and started to ford the river but, when they were halfway across, the leper woman transformed into Vajrayogini and led him to the Land of the Dakinis. Purang Lotsawa Purang Lotsawa was a great Teacher who lived near Shiri Mon-astery in western Tibet and who had many spiritually advanced students. When he became aware, through various signs, that he was ready to attain Pure Dakini Land, he dug out a small cave in a hillside where he planned to live in solitary retreat. As he entered the cave at the start of his retreat he announced that if he left before attaining Pure Dakini Land his throat should be cut by the Dharma Protectors. He told his assistant to seal the entrance of his cave, leaving only a small hole through which food and drink could be passed. Some time later a Tantric Yogi accompanied by eight women arrived and asked to see Purang. The assistant turned them away, but that evening, when he told Purang about the visitors, he was given instructions not to dismiss anyone who asked to see him. When the visitors returned the next day the assistant showed them to the cave. Suspecting that they were not ordi-nary people, he looked for a place to hide so that he could see. what would happen, but by the time he had found a suitable place the visitors had unaccountably entered the cave. The assistant crept up to the small hole in the side of the cave and looked in. The cave was full of radiant light. The eight women were sitting in a row with the Yogi at one end and Purang at the other. The Yogi was rolling letters of gold which he passed to the women. They in turn passed them to Purang who appeared to be eating them. Purang became aware of the assist-ant looking through the hole and shouted at him to go away. He left immediately. Later, when he returned with Purang's supper, Purang was sitting alone without any sign of the Yogi or the eight women. That night Purang went to the Pure Land of Vajrayogini. 13"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND The next morning the assistant took Purang his breakfast but found the cave empty. Although he was convinced that Purang had attained Pure Dakini Land he was afraid that others might think that he had been the cause of Purang's disappearance. To allay such suspicions he called together a number of people and showed them that the seal to Purang' s cave had not been broken. Although some people were convinced and believed that Purang had attained Pure Dakini Land, others still sus-pected the assistant of murder. To resolve the matter, a Tibetan translator was sent to Nepal to consult a famous Vajrayogini practitioner who had great powers of clairvoyance. After the translator had explained what had happened to Purang, the Nepalese practitioner replied that on the day of the disappearance, while in meditation, he had seen through his clairvoyance that Purang had been invited to the Pure Land of the Dakinis by a Hero and eight Heroines. The. Hero was Heruka and the eight Heroines were the eight Goddesses of the doorways of Heruka's mandala. As a result of Purang's pure practice, Heruka and Vajrayogini had come to his cave and taken him to Pure Dakini Land. Many great masters of the Gelug tradition such as Takbu Tenpai Gyaltsan, Drubchen Cho Dorje, Changkya Rolpai Dorje, and many of their disciples have attained the Pure Land of the Dakinis. Such things happen even today. For example, in recent years· there was a Tibetan layman called Gonche who lived in eastern Tibet in a place called Chatring. To all appearances he was an evil man, always fighting and stealing and generally engaging in many negative actions. The Chinese invasion of Tibet eventually forced him to flee from his motherland. One day, on his journey into exile, he saw a boat crossing a stretch of water carrying about thirty Chinese soldiers. He shot holes in the boat causing it to sink, and all the soldiers were drowned. When he finally reached the Nepalese border he joined the Tibetan resistance. Some years later, as an elderly man, he travelled to Dharam-sala in India where he visited Trijang Rinpoche. Trijang Rin-poche advised him to abandon all negative actions and to devote himself to spiritual practice. From that day Gonche's mind 14"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION changed. He developed strong regret for all his past harmful actions and promised to practise Dharma sincerely. Some time later, Trijang Rinpoche gave a Vajrayogini empowerment to a large group of his disciples and Gonche was among them. Trijang Rinpoche advised Gonche to go to Nepal to do a long retreat on Vajrayogini. Receiving material assistance from his family and spiritual advice from some local Geshes, Gonche entered into retreat, but during his retreat he died. At the time of his death many people saw a rainbow above his retreat hut. Three days later he was cremated and this time a rainbow appeared over the funeral pyre. These rainbows were seen by the local people as well as by the monks who had assembled to pray for him. High Lamas said later that the rainbows were signs that Vajrayogini had led Gonche to her Pure Land while he was in the intermediate state. These accounts of the attainments of past practitioners demon-strate the great value of the practice of Vajrayogini and are a source of inspiration for our own practice. THE QUALIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR PUTTING THESE INSTRUCTIONS INTO PRACTICE Before we can practise the two stages of Vajrayogini Tantra we must have certain qualifications. Through the study and practice of Lamrim, we should have gained at least some experience of the three principal aspects of the path: renunciation, bodhi-chitta, and the correct view of emptiness. These are sometimes known as the paths common to both Sutra and Tantra. Once we have built the foundation of experience in the common paths, we are qualified to enter into the special path of Tantra. The gateway to Tantric practice is empowerment. Before we can engage in Vajrayogini practice we must receive from a qualified Tantric Master the empowerment of Heruka and the empowerment of Vajrayogini in her sindhura mandala. These empowerments place special, wholesome propensities on our consciousness which, when nurtured by subsequent spiritual practice, eventually develop into the realizations of generation 15"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND stage and completion stage. During the empowerments we take certain vows and commitments which must be qbserved scrupu-lously. Upon this basis, if we practise Vajrayogini' s instructions continuously and sincerely we will receive all the benefits men-tioned above. THE FOUR SPECIAL CAUSES OF SWIFT ATTAINMENTS To achieve swiftly the realizations associated with Vajrayogini practice we need four special causes. The first is unwavering faith. We should not become discouraged if after only a few days or months of intense effort we do not achieve any special results. We must train consistently with unshakeable conviction in the benefits of our practice. Our practice should be like a broad river that flows steadily and continuously. The second special cause is wisdom that overcomes doubts and misgivings concerning the practice. We should have a clear understanding of the eleven yogas of generation stage and of the meditations of completion stage. In general, whenever we practise Dharma, we must first overcome all doubts about the instructions we have received and reach clear conclusions about them. By listening to and studying complete and correct instruc-tions we develop the wisdom arisen from listening, and through thinking about the meaning of the instructions we develop the wisdom arisen from contemplation. Only then can we proceed to meditate single-pointedly on the conclusions we have reached. It is most important that while we are engaged in Dharma practice our concentration should be single-pointed. If we prac-tise with a distracted mind and do not gain realizations it is not the fault of the Dharma, the Buddha, or our Gurus. Even when we are not engaged in formal meditation we should be able to focus our mind clearly on any virtuous object we choose. If our mind continually wanders to a multitude of extraneous objects our progress will be hampered. As we begin to control our mind and gain the ability to direct it at will, we shall experience results from our meditation and make quick progress along the 16"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION spiritual path. Our mind should be like a fine, well-trained horse that is powerful, but easy to control and direct. Such a horse will take a rider wherever he wishes to go, whereas ari unruly horse will follow only its own wishes and disregard its rider. Once we can direct our mind to a specific object and keep it focused on that object, we will have a well-controlled mind and our life will not be wasted through distracted thoughts. Even in worldly activities success comes only as a result of single-minded concentration, so how much more important is strong concentration for successful Dharma practice? In Dharma, we attain realizations only by practising with single-pointed con-centration, and this is possible only if we understand the instructions thoroughly. The third special cause of swift attainments is the integration of all our spiritual training into the practice of one Deity. Je Tsongkhapa showed how all the essential practices of Tantra can be included within the sadhana of a single Deity. Following Je Tsongkhapa's instructions, later Teachers wrote the Vajra-yogini sadhana we now practise. When we practise this sadhana we practise the essential meaning of all Tantric Deities. Our progress towards attaining Tantric realizations will be seriously obstructed if doubts and dissatisfaction cause us to change continually from one Deity to another. We should be like a wise blind person who relies totally upon one trusted guide instead of attempting to follow a number of people at once. There is a traditional Tibetan analogy that illustrates this point. Tibetan farmers used to allow their cows to roam freely during the day, mixing with the cows belonging to other farmers, but every evening all the cows would return to the right farm. If a blind person wished to go to a particular farm all he had to do was hold on to the tail of a cow that belonged to that farm. If he did this he would definitely reach the right farm, but if he kept switching from one cow to another he would soon be completely lost. Similarly, by following the prac-tice of one particular Deity wholeheartedly we will definitely attain enlightenment, but if we keep changing from one to another we will never reach our goal, no matter how much effort we make. 17"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND During his stay in Tibet, the Indian Buddhist Master Atisha met the renowned translator Lama Rinchen Sangpo, and was greatly impressed by his knowledge of Dharll}a. One day Rin-chen Sangpo invited Atisha to visit him to discuss Dharma. Atisha realized that Rinchen Sangpo was a very erudite scholar and ,said to him, 'You are such a wonderful Teacher that it seems unnecessary for me to stay in Tibet.' Then Rinchen Sangpo showed Atisha his four meditation cushions and four different Tantric mandalas. Atisha asked why he had four cushions and four mandalas. Rinchen Sangpo replied that every day he practised in four sessions. The first session, on the first cushion, was to accomplish the mandala of an Action Tantra Deity; the second session, on the second cushion, was to accomplish the mandala of a Performance Tantra Deity; the third se~sion, on the third cushion, was to accomplish the man-dala of a Yoga Tantra Deity; and the last session, on the fourth cushion, was to accomplish the mandala of a Highest Yoga Tantra Deity. Atisha asked why he did not incorporate all these Deity practices into one sadhana, accomplishing the mandalas of all these Deities within the mandala of one Deity. When Rinchen Sangpo asked how he could do this Atisha exclaimed, 'Yes, I do need to stay in Tibet!' Atisha advised Rinchen Sangpo that when he was visualizing the mandala of his personal Deity he should invite all the other Deities together with their mandalas to dissolve into his per-sonal Deity and mandala. By maintaining the recognition that his personal Deity was the synthesis of all the Deities of the four Tantric classes he could complete the practices of all other Deities by completing the practice of his personal Deity. Atisha used to say, 'Some of you Tibetans have tried to accomplish a hundred Deities but have failed to achieve a single attainment, while some Indian Buddhists have achieved the attainments of a hundred Deities by accomplishing the practice of just one.' Although we should concentrate on the practice of one par-ticular Deity, we should not neglect to practise others if we have a commitment to do so. For those practitioners who are dedicated to the practice of Vajrayogini, who see it as their main practice, and who are striving to achieve generation stage and completion stage realizations by depending upon this practice, 18"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION there is a special method to keep their commitments to other Deities. Suppose that such a practitioner, in addition to his daily Vajrayogini practice, has commitments to recite the long sadhanas of Heruka, Yamantaka, and Guhyasamaja every day. If he recites the words of all these sadhanas every day he will have little opportunity to do any serious meditation. His Tantric practice will be largely verbal, and although he might place many virtuous imprints on his mindstream he will not achieve genuine meditational experience. For such a person the real purpose of Deity practice will be lost. For this reason, great Masters such as Atisha, Phabongkha Rinpoche, and Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche advise serious Vajrayogini practitioners to integrate all their Tantric practices into the Vajrayogini sadhana. To do this they should realize that all Tantric Deities have the same nature, differing only in appearance. The essential meaning of the practices of all Highest Yoga Tantra Deities is the same-to transform ordinary death, inter-mediate state, and rebirth into the three bodies of a Buddha. This transformation is effected first in an imagined form by using the meditations and visualizations of generation stage, and then in reality by controlling the subtle winds, drops, and mind through completion stage meditation. All the methods necessary to do this are contained in the practice of Vajrayogini. With this understanding, committed Vajrayogini practitioners should apply themselves wholeheartedly to the generation and completion stages of Vajrayogini, knowing that by so doing they are fulfilling the real purpose of all their commitments to other Deities, even if they neglect to say the words of the sadhanas of other Deities. This advice should not be used as an excuse for laziness. Its purpose is to give dedicated practitioners more time to concen-trate on their personal Deity practice and thereby achieve the essential realizations of all Deity practices. For those who are not yet able to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the practice of a particular Tantric Deity, it is better that tho:y continue to recite the words of all the sadhanas to which they have commit-ted themselves. The fourth special cause of swift realization is to practise in secret. If we do not conceal our Tantric practice from others the 19"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND blessings we have received during the empowerments will be dissipated. Talking openly about our meditational experiences is a fault. It may cause us to develop attachment to being respected and praised by others. Such attachment to reputation is a mara, a demonic interference that is a serious obstacle to pure Dharma practice and spiritual attainment. A good repu-tation may help us to gain external wealth and possessions but these things deplete. our merit and are obstacles to gaining internal we>alth. The attainment of bodhichitta, the attainment of the six perfections, and the realizations of generation and completion stage practice are our real wealth; we should not waste our merit on external possessions. As Shantideva says in Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, I, who seek liberation, have no need of wealth or a good reputation For they only keep me bound within cyclic existence. It is helpful to recall these words frequently. We should remain indifferent to our reputation while acting in accordance with the Dharma. The equilibrium of our mind should not be dis-turbed by praise or blame, gain or loss. If we are attached to these things we will constantly be distracted from our spiritual practice. We will waste energy trying to acquire possessions and a good reputation, and when we fail in these endeavours we will become overly disheartened. For these reasons it was the custom of the Kadampa Teachers and of Je Tsongkhapa to praise others but to declare their own faults and limitations. Talking carelessly about our meditational experiences or prac-tice attracts hindrances and obstacles, just as talking openly about our wealth attracts thieves. Although we should strive assiduously in our practice of Tantra we should not reveal our practice to others. There are only two exceptions to this rule: we should confide in our Gurus, and we can discuss aspects of our practice with friends engaged in similar practices, provided that they have faith and keep their commitments purely. If we create the four special causes and fulfil all the conditions necessary for successful practice that have been explained, we 20"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION will definitely attain realizations quickly through the practice of the instructions of Vajrayogini. WHAT ARE THE OUTER AND INNER PURE DAKIN! LANDS? Outer Pure Dakini Land is beyond the world of ordinary experi-ence. It is the Pure Land of Buddha Vajrayogini and Buddha Heruka. A Pure Land is a world that is free from true sufferings. Nowhere in samsara is without true sufferings because the samsaric environment itself acts as a condition to experience suffering. Ordinary beings are born in samsara without choice and continually have to experience dissatisfaction and mi~ery. However, if we purify our mind, we purify our experience of the world and thereby attain a Pure Land free from all suffering. There are different Pure Lands associated with different Bud-dhas. Pure Dakini Land is similar to the Pure Lands of Tushita and Sukhavati, except that Heruka and Vajrayogini's Pure Land is the only one in which beings can receive teachings on Highest Yoga Tantra and put them into practice. When, through Vajrayogini' s guidance, those who are very old and infirm reach her Pure Land they will no longer experi-ence the sufferings of old age and disease. All signs of their old age will disappear and they will be transformed into sixteen-year-olds of great beauty and vitality, enjoying an endless life-span. All the enjoyments they wish for will spontaneously appear. They will never be reborn in samsara again, unless they choose to for compassionate reasons. Everyone who reaches this Pure Land will receive teachings on Highest Yoga Tantra directly from Heruka and thereby attain enlightenment quickly. Outer Pure Dakini Land can also be explained in terms of an individual practitioner's personal experience. From this point of view, outer Pure Dakini Land is attained by completing the practices of the generation stage of Vajrayogini. During our training in generation stage meditation, we visualize our body as the pure body of Buddha Vajrayogini, our immediate sur-roundings as the mandala of V ajrayogini, and our world as Pure Dakini Land. If we engage in generation stage practice 21"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND continuously, the ordinary, impure appearances to our mind will gradually diminish and finally cease altogether. Once we have gained a firm realization of generation stage we shall experience only pure appearances, and our world will be trans-formed into Pure Dakini Land. The great Teacher Tenpa Rabgya said that Pure Dakini Land is not some far-away place, nor is it necessary to disappear from this world to reach it. Pure appearances are experienced only by realized prac-titioners. It is generally accepted in both Sutra and Tantra that the world appears to our mind as faulty, imperfect, and unsatis-factory because our mind is impure, polluted by the delusions and their imprints. In Ornament for Clear Realization, Venerable Maitreya says that when the minds of sentient beings become completely pure, their environment becomes a Buddha's Pure Land. A Pure Land can be attained only by purifying the mind. Even when we have attained outer Pure Dakini Land through a firm realization of generation stage, we shall still appear to others as ordinary, impure beings. Ordinary people cannot recognize that another person is in a Pure Land because they cannot perceive that person's Pure Land and cannot share their experience of it. Someone once asked Milarepa in which Pure Land he had attained enlightenment and Milarepa pointed to his cave. The questioner could see only a cold, empty cave, but for Milarepa that cave was a Pure Land. Because the minds of ordinary beings are impure, whatever appears to them is seen as ordinary. As ordinary beings with ordinary appearance, we cannot experience anything as totally pure and perfect. Even an emanation of Buddha appears to us to have faults. Everything we experience is impure, potentially harmful, and in the nature of suffering. It is because we have ordinary appearance that we view ourselves and others as imperfect, subject to faults such as sickness and ageing. According to Sutra teachings, the root of samsara is self-grasping and the delusions that arise from it. However, accord-ing to Secret Mantra teachings, the root of samsara is ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions. The self-grasping recog-nized by Sutra practitioners is only a gross, ordinary conception. In this context, any living being who is not a Buddha, and 22"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION any environment, enjoyment, or body that is not a Buddha's is ordinary. Perceptions of these objects as ordinary due to impure minds are ordinary appearances, and the minds that conceive of objects in this way are ordinary conceptions. According to Secret Mantra teachings, ordinary appearances are obstructions to omniscience, and ordinary conceptions are obstructions to liberation. Both ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions have many levels of subtlety. One of the main purposes of practising generation stage meditation is to overcome ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions. We can overcome ordinary appearances by gener-ating a clear appearance of being Vajrayogini, and we can over-come ordinary conceptions by developing strong divine pride of being Vajrayogini. Because of our ordinary perceptions and ordinary concep-tions, we experience an endless cycle of ordinary death, ordin-ary intermediate state, and ordinary rebirth. This endless cycle, known as 'samsara', must be broken. Through generation stage and completion stage practice we can purify,the three ordinary states of death, intermediate state, and rebirth, and thereby attain the three bodies of a Buddha. When we attain a full realization of the generation stage of Vajrayogini, we experience our environment as Pure Dakini Land, and when we attain the illusory body in the aspect of Vajrayogini, our body becomes the actual body of the Deity. When we achieve full enlightenment in the form of Vajrayogini we become a newly-born Buddha Vajrayogini, our place of residence becomes a newly-developed mandala of Vajrayogini, and our world becomes a newly-developed Pure Dakini Land. With a superficial realization of generation stage meditation we will attain only a similitude of Pure Dakini Land. By gradu-ally developing the power of our generation stage meditation, this similitude will be strengthened and stabilized and we will move closer to attaining the actual Pure Dakini Land. By practis-ing the generation stage and completion stage meditations con-tinuously and enthusiastically, we will complete the spiritual path by depending on Vajrayogini. At first we may doubt the existence of Pure Dakini Land or doubt that it is possible to reach it. To overcome such doubts, 23"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND we can consider dreams. Sincere practitioners familiar with Vajrayogini practice may dream of reaching a Pure Land. In their dream they will see all places as pure and themselves as Vajrayogini. At that time, they do not think they are dreaming. They believe they are in a Pure Land and therefore experience great joy and happiness. If they were to remain in that happy state without ever waking up it would be valid to say that, according to their experience, they were in Pure Dakini Land. Through studying the correct view of emptiness we can understand that everything is merely an appearance to the mind and, like a dream, merely imputed by conceptual thought. This understanding is extremely helpful for developing conviction in the existence of Pure Lands. Clear and deep understanding of the nature of outer Pure Dakini Land will help us to gain a firm faith in Buddhadharma. Through this we will practise with greater power and enthusiasm. Inner Pure Dakini Land is meaning clear light. This is achieved only through completion stage meditation. Through completion stage meditation, we develop spontaneous great bliss, and when this mind meditates on emptiness and gains a direct realization it is called 'meaning clear light'. This is the fourth of the five stages of completion stage meditation. When we attain inner Pure Dakini Land through Vajrayogini practice, we also attain outer Pure Dakini Land. This is explained more fully later in this book. The way to train in the two stages of Vajrayogini Tantra is explained in the instructions that follow. First there is an ex-planation of how to train in generation stage, and then there is an explanation of how to train in completion stage. The instructions on generation stage are in two parts: an explanation of how to practise the eleven yogas of generation stage, and an explanation of how to attain outer Pure Dakini Land through the practice of generation stage. The eleven yo gas of generation stage are: 1 The yoga of sleeping 2 The yoga of rising 3 The yoga of experiencing nectar 24"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY EXPLANATION 4 The yoga of immeasurables 5 The yoga of the Guru 6 The yoga of self-generation 7 The yoga of purifying migrators 8 The yoga of being blessed by Heroes and Heroines 9 The yoga of verbal and mental recitation 10 The yoga of inconceivability 11 The yoga of daily actions The instructions that follow explain how to practise each of these eleven yogas. We first need to study these instructions carefully to ensure that we understand clearly each of the yogas. Then, when we feel ready to put them into practice, we should begin with the yoga of sleeping and continue through to the eleventh yoga, the yoga of daily actions. If we repeat this cycle of practices every day all our actions will be included within the eleven yogas. 25"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Yogas of Sleeping, Rising, and Experiencing Nectar The first three of the eleven yogas, the yogas of sleeping, rising, and experiencing nectar, are methods for purifying our body, speech, and mind. Collectively they are known as the 'yogas of three joys' or the 'yogas of the three purifications'. The latter title is more correct as it is the one given in the sadhanas of Heruka. The yogas of sleeping and rising purify our body and mind, transforming them into the body and mind of Vajra-yogini, and the yoga of experiencing nectar purifies our speech, transforming it into the· speech of Vajrayogini. THE YOGA OF SLEEPING In general, the yoga of sleeping is included within the eleventh yoga, the yoga of daily actions, along with the yoga of eating, and other daily activities. However, there are good reasons why the practice of Vajrayogini begins at night, with the yoga of sleeping considered as a separate practice. One reason is that during the night the Dakinis of the Twenty-four Places visit sincere Vajrayogini practitioners and bestow their blessings. In Vajradaka Tantra it says: The Ladies of these Places Bestow siddhis upon practitioners. They always come at night, They always go at night. Here, the 'Ladies of these Places' are the Dakinis of the Twenty-four Holy Places. If we are not accomplished meditators, we cannot maintain mindfulness and alertness during sleep. This leaves our mind unguarded and exposed to unseen influences. For example, we 26"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SLEEPING, RISING, AND EXPERIENCING NECTAR may fall asleep with a positive mind but wake up feeling bad because during the night we were disturbed by evil spirits who took advantage of our defenceless state. Sincere practitioners of Vajrayogini, however, may find the opposite happening. They may go to bed with a mind preoccupied with the problems of the day, but wake up refreshed, with a clear and positive mind. Although 'the external situation may be much the same, they are now able to face it with a peaceful mind. They may also find that obstacles to their Dharma practice inexplicably disappear overnight. These are signs that during the night they have been visited by Dakinis from the Twenty-four Holy Places who blessed their mind and subtle body. Dakinis are able to help a practitioner in this way when he or she establishes a connection with them through pure Vajrayogini practice. Another reason for beginning the practice of Vajrayogini at night is that during sleep the clear light mind of sleep manifests naturally and, with training, this mind can be used to progress along the spiritual path towards the realizations of example clear light and meaning clear light. One of the main reasons for practising Vajrayogini Tantra is to attain these realizations. During the day we perceive many different things, but in the darkness of night all these appearances vanish. The day there-fore symbolizes conventional truth and the night symbolizes emptiness, or ultimate truth. Beginning our practice at night reminds us that the main purpose of training in these instruc-tions is to develop a mind of clear light that directly realizes emptiness. Remembering this, we begin our practice of the eleven yogas of Vajrayogini with the yoga of sleeping. Other texts present different reasons but the ones given here are the most accurate. Since we all spend a large portion of our time asleep, it is important that we have a method to transform sleep into the spiritual path. The states of sleeping, dreaming, and waking are similar to death, intermediate state, and rebirth. Through continual training in the yogas of sleeping and rising we will gain the ability to purify and transform our death, intermediate state, and rebirth into the spiritual path. This is the main pur-pose of generation stage meditation. 27"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Briefly, there are seven principal benefits to be gained from engaging in the yoga of sleeping: 1 We accumulate great merit. 2 All our hindrances and obstacles are dispelled. 3 We will receive direct care and guidance from Vajrayogini in all our future lives. 4 We will be blessed by the Heroines of the Twenty-four Auspicious Places of Heruka. 5 Our practice of generation stage meditation will be strengthened and stabilized. 6 We will attain both outer and inner Pure Dakini Lands. 7 We will attain enlightenment quickly. There are two ways to practise the yoga of sleeping: according to generation stage and according to completion stage. We may choose either method. The yoga of sleeping according to generation stage Sleeping according to generation stage creates great merit and is a cause to attain the Form Body of Vajrayogini. Successful practice of the yoga of sleeping depends upon having gained proficiency in the sixth yoga, the yoga of self-generation. When the time for sleep approaches, we should regard our surroundings as the Pure Land of the Dakinis and our room as Vajrayogini's mandala, the phenomena-source. The phenom-ena-source is the nature of Vajrayogini' s wisdom. It is made of red light in the shape of a double tetrahedron, and it should be visualized as large as possible. Inside the phenomena-source we visualize a throne of precious jewels supported by eight snow lions. Covering the surface of the throne is an eight-petalled lotus, and on top of this there is either a sun cushion or a moon cushion. When we lie down to sleep we visualize ourself clearly as Vajrayogini, but without the usual ornaments and hand implements. If we wish to sleep lightly and wake quickly, or if we wish to sleep with strong concentration, we visualize ourself lying on a cool moon cushion. If we feel cold, or if we wish to sleep 28"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SLEEPING, RISING, AND EXPERIENCING NECTAR deeply, or for a long time, we visualize ourself going to sleep on a warm sun cushion. Usually, however, we need a balanced sleep. If we sleep too lightly we may wake too readily, but if we sleep too deeply we will be unable to retain mindfulness during our dreams. To achieve a balanced sleep we visualize ourself lying on a sun cushion, but without imagining it to be warm. We should lie facing west with our head towards the north. Facing west is auspicious because we invite the Dakinis to visit us from the land of Odiyana, which is in the west. The soles of our feet should point towards the south. This is auspicious for a long life because it symbolizes our wish to subdue Yama, the Lord of Death, who is said to live in the south. Our practice is enhanced by sleeping in this position, but if it is not practical because of the shape of our room or the position of the bed, we can simply imagine that we are doing this. Directions are merely imputed. On the northern petal of the lotus flower we visualize our root Guru in the aspect of Buddha Vajradharma. Visualizing our Guru in the aspect of a Buddha is a practice unique to Secret Mantra. According to the Vinaya, the Guru should be regarded as like a Buddha, but according to Secret Mantra, the Guru should be regarded as a Buddha. Although some texts state that we should visualize our Guru in the aspect of Hero Vajradharma, there are in fact three ways in which we can visualize him: iri his outer aspect, as Hero Vajradharma, in his inner aspect, as Buddha Vajradharma, or in his secret aspect, as Buddha Vajradharma ·with consort. In essence there is no difference between these thn?e aspects of the Guru because Hero Vajradharma, Buddha Vajradharma without consort, and Buddha Vajradharma with consort are exactly the same nature. Whichever aspect we choose to visualize, we should regard him as our root Guru, the synthesis of all the Buddhas. Hero Vajradharma is red. His left hand holds at the level of his heart a skullcup filled with nectar, his right hand is raised holding a damaru, and his left shoulder supports a khatanga. Buddha Vajradharma looks exactly like Buddha Vajradhara, except that Buddha Vajradharma is red and adorned with six 29"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Buddha Vajradharma"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SLEEPING, RISING, AND EXPERIENCING NECTAR bone ornaments while Buddha Vajradhara is blue and wears ornaments made of jewels. Buddha Vajradharma is similar to Buddha Amitabha in that he is a manifestation of the speech of all the Buddhas. It is primarily through receiving teachings from our Guru that we receive the blessings of Buddha's speech, so for us our Guru functions as the manifestation of Buddha's speech. To help us develop this recognition we visualize our Guru as Buddha Vajradharma. When we practise the yoga of sleeping according to genera-tion stage the most important thing is to maintain strong divine pride that we are Vajrayogini, that our room is the phenomena-source, and that our bed is a sun cushion or moon cushion. As we lie on our bed we imagine that we rest ou:r head in Guru Vajradharma's lap and then, with strong faith in our ·Guru, we go to sleep. As we fall asleep we should prevent all ordinary appearances and maintain only pure appearano:!s. When we wake we should immediately recollect that we are Vajrayogini, that our room is the phenomena-source mandala, and that our root Guru is on the northern petal of the lotus in the aspect of Buddha Vajradharma. The yoga of sleeping according to comph~tion stage In the completion stage yoga of sleeping, before we go to sleep we imagine that the entire world system and all its inhabitants melt into light, and that this light dissolves into our body. Our body then gradually melts into light and diminishes in size until it dissolves into the letter BAM at our heart. At this stage only the letter BAM appears to our mind; nothing else is perceived. Then the letter BAM gradually dissolves into its head, or upper horizontal line, the head dissolves into the crescent moon, the crescent moon dissolves into the drop, and the drop dissolves into the nada; the three-curved line at the top of the letter. The nada then gradually decreases in size, until finally it dissolves into the clear light of emptiness. Now only emptiness appears. It is important to feel that our mind of clear light has become one with emptiness, like water 31"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND mixed with water. This inseparable union of our very subtle mind and emptiness is called the 'clear light of emptiness'. We identify this as the Dharmakaya, the Truth Body of Vajrayogini, and then we fall asleep, maintaining this recognition through-out our sleep. When we wake the next morning we immediately remember emptiness. This practice increases our wisdom, caus-ing us to gain experience of the clear light, and eventually to achieve the Truth Body of a Buddha. The clear light mind manifests automatically during sleep and during death, but only those proficient in completion stage meditation are able to retain mindfulness at these times. Most people are unable to recognize either the clear light of sleep or the clear light of death. Besides sleep and death, the only other time the clear light manifests is when all the winds are deliber-ately gathered and dissolved into the central channel through the force of completion stage meditation. Yogis who can cause the clear light mind to manifest in this way are able to use this mind to meditate on emptiness. When they fall asleep they remain mindful throughout their sleep and use the clear light of sleep to deepen their experience of emptiness. In deep sleep the winds naturally and forcefully gather and dissolve within the central channel, and the clear light that manifests at that time is purer than that which a novice completion stage med-itator can induce through meditation alone. Therefore, sleep becomes extremely valuable for these Yogis. Their most pro-found experience of emptiness occurs during deep sleep. Meditators who are familiar with transforming the clear light of sleep into the spiritual path will also be able to transform the clear light of death. They will remain aware throughout their death process and when the clear light of death dawns they will be able to transform it into ultimate example clear light. This realization directly prevents ordinary death. For this reason transforming sleep into the path is one of the principal practices of Secret Mantra, and one of the most important methods for attaining enlightenment. 32"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SLEEPING, RISING, AND EXPERIENCING NECTAR THE YOGA OF RISING There are two ways to practise the yoga of rising depending upon which way we practise the yoga of sleeping. If we sleep according to generation stage we should practise the yoga of rising according to generation stage, and if we sleep according to completion stage we should practise the yoga of rising accord-ing to completion stage. The yoga of rising according to generation stage Immediately upon waking we should recall our visualization of the previous night and try to prevent ordinary appearances. We should develop three recognitions: that the world is Pure Dakini Land with our room as the phenomena-source mandala, that we are Vajrayogini, and that all other beings are Heroes and Heroines. We imagine that in the space around us Dakas and Dakinis are reciting Vajrayogini's mantra. This causes us to arise with the joyful motivation to benefit others. Throughout the day we regard any sound we hear as the sound of this mantra. While dressing, instead of putting on ordinary clothes, we imagine that we are offering the five ornaments, such as the crown, and the earrings, to ourself generated as Vajrayogini. Then we prostrate three times to our root Guru on the northern petal of the lotus. This causes our Guru to generate a joyful wish to enter our body and mind. We imagine that he melts into light and decreases to the size of a small egg. He then enters through our crown and dissolves into the letter BAM at our heart. Throughout the day we should remember that our Guru is at our heart in the aspect of a letter BAM. We should also retain the divine pride of our body and mind as Vajratyogini's body and mind, the room as the phenomena-source mandala, the world as Pure Dakini Land, and all beings as Heroes or Hero-ines. When we a:re about to develop negative states of mind we should immediately recall these recognitions. If we can maintain this pure appearance there will be no basis for delusions to 33"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND arise. We should try to maintain these three recognitions until we go to sleep, when we once again practise the yoga of sleeping. The yoga of rising is practised continually throughout the day and the yoga of sleeping is practised continually throughout the night. If we practise these two yogas diligently all our daily actions become a quick path to enlightenment, and Buddha-hood will definitely be attained before very long. The yoga of rising according to completion stage If we have slept according to completion stage yoga, absorbed in the clear light of emptiness, then upon waking we imagine that from that state of emptiness we arise instantly in the form of Vajrayogini, just as clouds might suddenly appear in a clear sky. As in the practice of generation stage, we should recall the three recognitions: ourself as Vajrayogini, the world as Pure Dakini Land with our room as the phenomena-source mandala, and all beings as Heroes and Heroines. The previous night we dissolved all phenomena into emptiness and our mind of clear light was mixed inseparably with this emptiness and identified as the Dharmakaya. From this union of bliss and emptiness a new world now appears, arising from the substance of our blissful mind and having the same nature as our mind. If we think like this it will be easy to generate pure appearance and develop the three recognitions. We should maintain the three recognitions strongly through-out the day, recalling them again and again until we go to sleep. In order to sustain this practice we need both mindfulness and alertness. By relying on mindfulness we should maintain the motivation and the three recognitions that we generated upon rising. From time to time we should apply alertness to check that we are still holding these recognitions. If we fail to apply alertness our practice of maintaining the three recognitions will quickly degenerate. We will lose pure appearance and revert to viewing ourself as ordinary. This happens because we are so accustomed to ordinary appearance. Whenever we find that we have forgotten our initial motivation, or the three recognitions, 34"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SLEEPING, RISING, AND EXPERIENCING NECTAR we should recall them immediately. To maintain pure appear-ance we do not need to recite words or sit on a cushion. If our daily actions are performed with mindfulness of the three recognitions they all become a method for attaining enlighten-ment quickly. When we are able to maintain these three recognitions all the time, everything we see will help us to develop great bliss. Nothing will appear as ugly, irritating, or disgusting. Every-thing experienced by our senses will seem attractive and will stimulate pure pleasure. Because, at this stage, we will be very familiar with meditating on the union of bliss and emptiness, even our sense pleasures will remind us of emptiness. Thus, by maintaining the three recognitions all our daily experiences can be transformed into the wisdom of great bliss and empti-ness. The practice of the three recognitions is the supr.eme moral discipline of Vajrayana. THE YOGA OF EXPERIENCING NECTAR The main purpose of practising the yoga of experiencing nectar is to transform our pleasures into the spiritual path. Because we are beings of the desire realm, we always take delight in seeing attractive forms, listening to beautiful sounds, smelling fragrant scents, tasting delicious food, and touching smooth and sensuous objects. These five objects of enjoyment, known as 'the five objects of desire', are usually enjoyed with a mind of attachment. Consequently most actions related to these objects are unwholesome and lead to experiences of suffering in the future. It is only through Dharma practice, particularly the practice of Secret Mantra, that experience of these five objects of desire can be transformed into a spiritual path. According to Sutra teachings, attachment to the five objects of desire is prevented by recognizing their faults and avoiding contact with them. In the practice of Secret Mantra, however, our enjoyment of desir-able objects is transformed into the spiritual path. This trans-formation is one of the special attributes of Secret Mantra. The practice of transforming enjoyments is very extensive 35"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND because it applies to every object of desire. One method is to regard all visual forms as being in essence Rupavajra goddesses, all sounds as Shaptavajra goddesses, all odours as Gandhavajra goddesses, all tastes as Rasavajra goddesses, and all tactile sen-sations as Parshavajra goddesses. When enjoying a delicious meal, for example, we should overcome our ordinary appear-ance of the food by dissolving it into emptiness and then, in its place, visualize Rasavajra goddesses offering us pure nectar which induces spontaneous great bliss. The enjoyments of the other senses can be transformed in a similar way. Another way to transform our experience of pleasurable objects into the spiritual path is to consider all sense objects to be in nature indivisible spontaneous great bliss and emptiness. We should regard every visual form, sound, taste, smell, and tactile object as having this nature. Amongst the many Tantric methods for transforming pleasur-able experiences into the spiritual path, the yoga of experiencing nectar is a method for transforming our enjoyment of food and drink, thereby enhancing our practice of Secret Mantra. There are three ways to practise the yoga of experiencing nectar. One way is to taste and swallow a nectar pill that has been made in the traditional way, another is to taste nectar made by dissolving a nectar pill into inner offering, and another is to regard our daily food and drink as nectar. We should try to obtain a genuine nectar pill that has been blessed by our Guru. There are various types of nectar pill produced according to the different traditions of Tibetan Bud-dhism. In all traditions, the ingredients are first blessed through meditative concentration and mantra recitation and then they are made into pills. A meditation similar to that for blessing the inner offering is then used to consecrate the pills, and the mantra OM AH HUM is recited many times with strong concen-tration until certain signs of accomplishment occur. At the beginning of the consecration, the ingredients of the pills are visualized as five 'meats' and five 'nectars'. The five 'meats' that are visualized are the corpses of a cow, a dog, an elephant, a horse, and a human, and the five 'nectars' that are visualized are excrement, brains, semen, blood, and urine. 36"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SLEEPING, RISING, AND EXPERIENCING NECTAR These base ingredients are then transformed into precious nectar. A highly realized meditator can transform the actual five meats and five nectars into the substance of precious nectar pills. When the first Panchen Lama made nectar pills there were clear signs of this transformation. Through the power of his concentration, fire blazed beneath the container and the ingredients boiled. However, only someone of exceptional accomplishment can transform impure substances such as urine and excrement into precious nectar pills; it is impossible for an untrained person of low realization to do this. It has been known for some practitioners to make pills from actual meats and nectars and to distribute them, even though they have received no signs that the ingredients have been transformed. We are warned in various Tantric texts not to accept such pills, otherwise we may find ourselves eating excrement! Instead we should try to obtain pills made from medicinal herbs by a quali-fied Tantric Master who is known for his accomplishment and integrity. We can then be confident that the pills we are given are both wholesome and genuine. If possible, we should try to obtain blessed pills that originate from those of Losang Chogyan, the first Panchen Lama. These pills are known as 'fire-blessed nectar pills'. Nowadays it is difficult to find pills wholly made by the first Panchen Lama. However, it is possible to obtain pills that have been made by later accomplished meditators who mixed a portion of a pill made by the Panchen Lama with fresh substances and con-tinued doing this with all subsequent pills so that each pill contains part of a pill blessed by the Panchen Lama. If we obtain one of these pills, we can use it as the basis of our practice of the yoga of experiencing nectar and also for making more pills. If we are unable to make new nectar pills ourselves, we should pour some alcohol into a skullcup, or some other small, clean container, and into this dissolve a pill blessed by a quali-fied Master. Every morning we should bless this nectar as an inner offering, as explained on pages 57-63, and then taste it. To do this, we dip our left ring finger into the inner offering nectar and draw a triangle on the palm of our right hand. The triangle is drawn counter-clockwise with one point towards the wrist. 37"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND We then dip the same finger into the inner offering three times, each time placing a drop in the centre of the triangle so that they coalesce to form a single drop. We bless this nectar by reciting the mantra OM AH HUM three times. We imagine that the blessed nectar now has three characteristics: it is a medicine-nectar that prevents sickness, it is a life-nectar that overcomes d~ath, and it is a wisdom-nectar that purifies all delusions. We them taste the nectar regarding it as an offering to ourself, the Deity Vajrayogini. While tasting the nectar we imagine that we experience spontaneous great bliss, and with this mind we meditate on emptiness, or at least remember emptiness briefly. If neither a nectar pill nor inner offering is available, as may be the case for instance when we are travelling, the first drink of the day can be used as the nectar offering. First we lift the cup with the left hand and bless the contents by reciting OM AH HUM three times. We imagine that the drink transforms into nectar with the three characteristics and we offer this to ourself generated as Vajrayogini. As we drink we imagine that we experience great bliss and then we meditate on emptiness, or recall emptiness according to our own understanding. The yoga of experiencing nectar should be practised first in the morning and then throughout the day whenever we eat or drink. In this way all our daily actions of eating and drinking become the yoga of experiencing nectar. When practising this yoga, practitioners of the body mandala of Vajrayogini should recall the thirty-seven Heroines at their heart and offer the nectar to them. There are many benefits from practising this yoga. For exam-ple, even if we are old, we will retain a youthful vitality because every time we eat or drink we accumulate great merit and create the cause to enjoy a long and happy life. Furthermore, the practice of the yoga of experiencing nectar is a cause to attain Tantric realizations such as spontaneous great bliss. Tasting nectar pills and inner offerings reminds us that all eating and drinking is to be transformed into the yoga of experiencing nectar. If we meditate on bliss and emptiness every time we eat and drink, our experience of the essential point of Secret Mantra, the union of spontaneous great bliss and emptiness, will rapidly increase. 38"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Yoga of Immeasurables The main practices of the yoga of immeasurables are going for refuge, generating bodhichitta, and meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva. Going for refuge is called 'immeasurable' because during this practice we concentrate on an immeasurable number of objects of refuge; the cultivation of the altruistic mind of bodhichitta is called 'immeasurable' because it trains us to focus our mind of compassion on immeasurable sentient beings; and meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva is called 'immeasurable' because it purifies the non-virtuous actions we have accumu-lated over an immeasurable period of time. The commentary to the yoga of immeasurables is presented under the following seven headings: 1 Going for refuge 2 Generating bodhichitta 3 Receiving blessings 4 Instantaneous self-generation as Vajrayogini 5 Blessing the inner offering 6 Blessing the outer offerings 7 Meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva Within the eleven yogas, the fourth yoga, the yoga of immeasur-ables, and the fifth yoga, the,yoga of the Guru, contain the practices of the four great preliminary guides: the great guide of going for refuge and generating bodhichitta, the great guide of meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva, the great guide of Guru yoga, and the great guide of mandala offe:rings. The first two are included in the yoga of immeasurables and the second two are included in the yoga of the Guru. These practices are called 'guides' because, by engaging in them, we are guided to the actual spiritual paths of Secret Mantra.

Meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva is the gateway to purifying negativities and downfalls. Guru yoga is the gateway to receiving blesSings. Mandala offerings is the gateway to collecting an accumulation of merit. There are two ways to practise the four great preliminary guides. One way is to emphasize merely reciting the words and collecting numbers, and the other is to emphasize the meaning of these practices by going for refuge purely, generating bodhi-chitta with strong compassion, reciting Vajrasattva's mantra with sincere regret, engaging in Guru yoga with strong faith, and making mandala offerings with firm concentration. In this way we will be. guided to the actual spiritual paths of Secret Mantra. GOING FOR REFUGE This has two parts: 1 General explanation 2 The practice of refuge General explanation It is not only Buddhists who go for refuge; everyone takes refuge in something or someone. Followers of non-Buddhist religions take refuge in their God or gods, and, because every-one in samsara has to experience fear and difficulties, even those who deny religion occasionally need to seek refuge. When danger or disaster strike, people cry out to others for refuge, even though they have never heard of Buddhist refuge. When animals or birds are chased by predators they seek refuge in holes in the ground, or up trees. Although all beings seek refuge from suffering, as Buddhists we should not go for refuge merely to avoid temporary prob-lems; rather we should go for refuge in order to free ourselves and others from all future suffering, and to achieve complete 40"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES freedom and happiness. However, if we cannot go for refuge for these reasons, going for refuge to the Three Jewels merely in order to be protected from the misery and dangers of this life is still very beneficial. There are three levels of motivation for taking Buddhist refuge. Those who go for refuge to the Three Jewels with the wish for protection from the sufferings of this life, or to be protected from falling to the lower realms in future lives, take the refuge of a person of initial scope. ThosE~ who have developed renunciation and desire merely their own release from samsara are known as beings of intermediate scope. When they go for refuge to the Three Jewels they do so in order to become liberated from all forms of suffering. This is the refuge of a person of intermediate scope. A person of the greatest capacity is motivated by great compassion for all beings and wishes to free them from suffering. Realizing that in order to fulfil this wish it is necessary to attain enlightenment, a person of great scope goes for refuge to the Three Jewels, seeing them as the principal means by which Buddhahood is achieved. Many people take refuge in worldly gods such as Ishvara, but worldly gods cannot provide ultimate security and happiness because they themselves are still bound within samsara. We need to seek a source of refuge that is perfectly reliable. Highly accomplished meditators and scholars endowed. with great powers of clairvoyance have discovered that it is only the Three Jewels -Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha -who can provide lasting protection from suffering. They are the supreme objects of refuge. Other than the Three Jewels, there is no source of ultimate refuge. If we have strong faith in the Three Jewels we will derive great benefit from reciting refuge prayers. It is important to understand clearly the significance of the Three Jewels, to know the meaning of going for refuge, and to contemplate these while reciting the refuge prayers. We should gradually deepen our understanding of the profound nature of the Three Jewels and strengthen our conviction in their protective power. Then we will come to know for ourselves that the Three Jewels are the supreme and only lasting source of refuge. Any being who is completely free from obstacles to liberation 41"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND and obstacles to omniscience is a Buddha Jewel. Obstacles to liberation are· delusions such as ignorance, attachment, anger, jealousy, arid so forth. Obstacles to omniscience are the imprints of these delusions that remain in our mental continuum after the delusions have been abandoned. Buddha Shakyamuni, Buddha Vajradhara, and Venerable Vajrayogini are all examples of Buddha Jewels. Any being who has realized emptiness directly is a Sangha Jewel. All Hinayana Superiors and Mahayana Superiors are Sangha Jewels. Dharma Jewels are either true paths or true cessations. True paths lead to true cessations, so a true path is similar to a cause and a true cessation is similar to an effect, but a true cessation is not an actual effect because it is permanent in nature and not produced from causes. The third Noble Truth concerns true cessations and the fourth Noble Truth concerns true paths. True paths are paths of wisdom that directly realize empti-ness, and all paths of method such as renunciation, compassion, and bodhichitta that are conjoined with such wisdom. These paths lead to definite freedom from the two obstructions and from the sufferings of samsara. A true cessation is the emptiness of inherent existence of a mind which, in dependence upon true paths, has been freed from either of the two obstructions. A true cessation is a non-affirming negative, a mere absence of inherent existence. At the beginning, it is not easy to under-stand true cessations. All minds are empty of inherent existence. Our root mind and its emptiness are our Buddha lineage, the seed from which our enlightenment will grow. The reason we are not yet enlight-ened is that our Buddha lineage is obscured by the obstructions to liberation and omniscience. These obstructions prevent the growth of our Buddha lineage. When our mind realizes empti-ness directly that realization is a true path. When through the power of this realization the ultimate nature of our mind is freed from any obstruction, that ultimate nature becomes a true cessation. When the mind is completely free from all delusions and their imprints it transforms into the omniscient mind of a Buddha and is called the 'Wisdom Truth Body'. The emptiness of that mind is called the 'Nature Body'. 42"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES At the moment, ordinary beings do not have true Dharma Jewels, but through our daily practice we can lay the foun-dations for achieving them in the future. For example, a mind that meditates on impermanence in order to overcome attach-ment is similar to a true path. When we temporarily abandon attachment through meditating on impermanence we gain tem-porary freedom from the problems of attachment, and this tem-porary abandonment of attachment is similar to a true cessation. Both the mind that meditates on impermanence and the tem-porary abandonment of attachment that depends upon this meditation are foundations for attaining actual Dharma Jewels. Therefore, pure meditation which is a cause of abandoning any delusion is a foundation for attaining true paths, and overcom-ing any delusion, even for a short time, is the basis for attaining true cessations. By improving our meditation on emptiness we will eventually gain a direct realization of emptiness and our mind will become a true path, an actual Dharma Jewel. Dharma Jewels, therefore, are not merely something that we visualize and make requests to, they are something to be developed within our own mental continuum through our practice of meditation. It is relatively easy for those who are trained in Buddhist thought to understand the meaning of the Buddha Jewel and the Sangha Jewel, but it is more difficult to understand the real meaning of the Dharma Jewel. Therefore it is not easy to understand the deeper meaning of going for refuge. To grasp the profound significance of refuge we must study and contem-plate for a long time, paying particular attention to understand~ ing the nature of the Dharma Jewel. There are two ways of going for refuge: going for causal refuge and goingfor resultant refuge. We go for causal refuge by visualizing the Three Jewels in front of us and making requests for protection and so forth. We go for resultant refuge by focusing our mind on the Three Jewels while generating a strong aspiration to become a Buddha Jewel and a Sangha Jevvel by attaining the realizations of the Dharma Jewel. This way of going for refuge is pr<J.ctised by those with special aptitude and greater skill. For an intelligent practitioner self-generation is a practice of 43"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND resultant refuge. At the beginning of the meditation session he or she generates the motivation: 'To attain enlightenment swiftly, I will bring the future result into the path by generating myself as a Buddha'. This is a type of resultant refuge. Our main purpose in practising Mahayana Buddhism is to perfect our ability to help all sentient beings by becoming a Buddha Jewel, and to do this we must gain all the realizations of the Dharma Jewel and become a Sangha Jewel. Until we gain a firm experience of generation stage meditation it is necessary to practise the eleven yogas in conjunction with the words of the Vajrayogini sadhana, but once we are familiar with the practices we can dispense with the words. In general, there are four Vajrayogini sadhanas: the extensive, the mid-dling, the condensed, and the very condensed. It is best to receive teachings on the extensive sadhana since they include the instructions for practising the three shorter ones. This commentary is based on the extensive sadhana known as Quick Path to Great Bliss, which was composed by Je Phabongkhapa. A translation of this sadhana can be found in Appendix II. The extensive sadhana of Vajrayogini is very short when compared with the extensive sadhanas of Heruka, Yamantaka, or Guhyasamaja, but it contains the essential meaning and blessings of all those Deity practices. If we really want to experi-ence the results of these instructions it is very important to practise the extensive sadhana of Vajrayogini regularly. The practice of refuge This has five parts: 1 Visualizing the objects of refuge 2 Developing renunciation 3 Developing compassion 4 Developing conviction in the power of the Three Jewels 5 Reciting the refuge prayer 44"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES Visualizing the objects of refuge In the space in front of us, level with our eyebrows, we visualize a vast jewelled throne supported by eight snow-lions. Com-pletely covering the surface of the throne is a four-petalled lotus. The eastern pet<!-1, which is closest to us, is white, the northern petal, which is to our right, is green, the western petal is red, and the southern petal is yellow. The centre of the lotus is green. Upon this there is a smaller throne and upon this there is a moon cushion and a sun cushion, with the sun cushion uppermost. Sitting on the sun cushion is our root Guru in the aspect of Buddha Vajradharma. He is red in colour with one face and two hands. His hands are crossed at his heart and hold a vajra and bell. At Guru Vajradharma's heart, on a sun cu.shiori, stand Father Heruka and Mother Vajrayogini. Heruka is blue with four faces and twelve arms. He embraces his consort Vajra-yogini who is red with one face and two arms. In the sadhana it says 'In the space before me appear Gum Chakrasamvara Father and Mother'. Here, according to Je Phabongkhapa's intention, 'Guru' refers to Guru Vajradharma, and 'Chakrasam-vara' refers to the Deity Heruka embracing Vajrayogini at Guru Vajradharma's heart. Around Guru Vajradharma, on the yellow anthers of the lotus, there are the Gurus of the Narokhacho lineage and all the other lineage Gurus of Sutra and Tantra. From the heart of Guru Vajradharma all the other objects of refuge emanate and fill the entire surface of the four-petalled lotus. At the centre of the eastern petal stands Vajrayogini sur-rounded by all the Deities of the four classes of Tantra. These are in four concentric circles with the Deities of Highest Yoga Tantra forming the innermost circle. These are surrounded by the Deities of Yoga Tantra, who are surrounded by the Deities of Performance Tantra, who are surrounded by the Deities of Action Tantra. At the centre of the southern petal is ·Buddha Shakyamuni surrounded by all the Emanation Bodies and Enjoyment Bodies of the Buddhas. At the centre of the western petal there are Dharma Jewels 45"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND in the symbolic form of books composed by the Gurus, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas. These books include the Kangyur, the Tengyur, the Tantric texts of Heruka, and a countless number of other texts together with their commentaries' that have been composed by other Buddhas. We should imagine that these books, which are made of light, are the realizations of the Gurus, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas. Holy beings benefit all sentient beings by displaying their realizations in the form of books that can be studied and put into practice. At the centre of the northern petal is Manjushri surrounded by all the superior Bodhisattvas, Emanated Arhats, Heroes, and Heroines. Around the outer edge of the four petals are the Dharma Protectors. Each refuge being is either sitting or stand-ing on a sun cushion or moon cushion. We imagine that each one is a real living being, not lifeless like a statue or painting. All the countless refuge objects on the throne in front of us are included within the Three Jewels: the Buddha Jewel, the Dharma Jewel, and the Sangha Jewel. The Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas are all Buddha Jewels; the Bodhisattvas, Emanated Arhats, Heroes, Heroines, and Dharma Protectors are all Sangha Jewels; and the Dharma books represent the Dharma Jewels. We should also regard all the refuge objects as manifes-tations of our root Guru, Guru Vajradharma. The Sangha Jewels are all manifestations of Guru Vajradharma's body, the Dharma Jewels are all manifestations of his speech, and the Buddha Jewels are all manifestations of his mind. We should not expect to be able to visualize the refuge assembly clearly at the beginning. To start with it is sufficient simply to imagine that they are in the space in front of us. The most important thing is to have strong conviction that they are actually present. Even though we may not be able to see them, we can be certain that they are appearing before us in subtle forms and that we are actually in their presence. Gradually, we shall be able to bring to mind a rough mental image of the whole assembly and, as we become more familiar with the visualization, we will naturally attain a more detailed image. To start with, however, we should not be concerned with detail. For example, when we think of a friend, we simply bring to mind a general image of him; we do not try to achieve a detailed 46"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES image of all his features such as his face, his legs, his arms, and so forth. In the same way, when we begin to visualize the refuge assembly we should be satisfied with a general image of the holy beings and not try to see all their specific details. Developing renunciation When we practise the yoga of rising we wake with the divine pride of being Vajrayogini, but when we go for refuge or engage in practices such as Vajrasattva purification we should tempor-arily give up this divine pride and think: In reality I have yet to become Vajrayogini. Because 1 have many delusions and because my mind still bears the imprints of the negative actions I have accumulated since beginningless time, I will continue to experience suffering. I have experienced pain and death countless times already. Each time I died I had to leave my body. If all the blood and bones of my previous bodies existed now the blood would be greater than an ocean and the bones would cover the entire earth. Countless times in the past, without any choice, I have had to experience the suffering of changing my body, and I will have to experience this again countless times in the future. In countless previous lives I have been born as an insect and survived on excrement. If all the excrement I consumed in my insect rebirths existed now it would form a pile as high as a mountain. How wonderful it would be if I could reach liberation in this life! If I do not, I will have to take countless more rebirths and experience the sufferings of birth, sickness, old age, and death again and again, and I shall continue to endure all the different sufferings such as the three sufferings, the six sufferings, and the eight sufferings. Reflecting on the sufferings of repeated birth, death, and rebirth in this way, we will develop a deep disgust for samsara. As long as we remain in samsara suffering is inevitable. The painful feelings we occasionally experience last only for a short time, but if we think of the sufferings of future lives and of samsara in general we will realize that unless we achieve libera-tion the misery we must experience is endless. We are now sitting comfortably reading this book, but our death may come 47"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND at any moment. If we die today, where will we·be next week? We all suffer the uncertainty of not knowing when we will die or where we will be reborn. The only thing we can be certain of is that wherever we take our next rebirth we will experience some form of suffering. If we are reborn as a human being we· will have to experience the suffering of being in the womb and leaving the womb. We will have forgotten all the knowledge we have acquired in this life and we will have to start our education all over again. At the moment we all have a sense of pride in ourselves, whatever our social status, but after death our bodies will be buried beneath the ground, or burned to ashes in a fire. The nature of samsara is impermanence and misery. If we contemplate all these points skilfully we will begin to feel very uncomfortable at the thought of having to remain ·in samsara. This discomfort will lead to renunciation, the wish to escape from samsara. Developing compassion Next we contemplate the sufferings of all other sentient beings. We think: I am not alone in having to experience suffering. There are countless sentient beings all of whom have experiences and prob-lems similar to my own, so how can I think of working solely for my own liberation? Every living being has at some time in the past been my dear mother. Again and again each one of them has had to experience the sufferings of sickness, ageing, death, having to part with what they like, having to encounter what they do not like, and having to search in vain for what they want. At some point or other they all have to endure hunger, thirst, conflict, uncertainty, and the repeated loss of status and companions. Up till now they have been unable to find security or satisfaction and have ~een forced to give up body after body, taking rebirth again and again. I cannot bear the misery of all these beings drowning in the ocean of samsara, each one having no choice but to experience immense suffering. I must work to liberate them all. 48"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES Developing conviction in the power ol the Three Jewels Without the protection and guidance of enlightened beings it is impossible for confused sentient beings to escape from sam-sara. If we think deeply we will come to realize that only the Three Jewels have the complete power to guide us and protect us. Buddhas can protect us because they have four special attributes: they are free from-all fear and suffering, they have skill in liberating all beings, they have great compassion for all sentient beings, and they are without partiality. The Dharma that is revealed by Buddha is the actual method for gaining release from samsara, and the Sangha help us to gain realiza-tions of Dharma. If we repeatedly contemplate these facts we will develop strong faith and conviction in the Three Jewels. Reciting the refuge prayer First we visualize the refuge assembly and generate the causes of refuge: renunciation, compassion, and faith in the Three Jewels. Then we recite the refuge prayer from the sadhana. We imagine that we are surrounded by the countless living beings of the six realms of samsara. We visualize them alUn human form, but we remember that in reality each one is experiencing the sufferings of their particular realm. Closest to us are our parents, family, and friends. We imagine that we all recite the refuge prayer together. If we practise in this way the benefit we :receive from going for refuge will be equal to the number of all sentient beings. With our prayer to the Gurus, we request our Spiritual Guides to bestow upon us their blessings and to transform all our actions of body, speech, and mind into the spiritual path. With our prayer to the Buddhas, we request their guidance on the spiritual paths lea,ding to liberation and enlightenment. With our prayer to the Dharma, we remember the special qualities of the Dharma Jewel and generate a strong wish to attain Dharma realizations quickly. With our prayer to the Superior Sanghas, we request their assistance on the spiritual path and the removal 49"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND of all obstacles preventing our attainment of liberation and enlightenment. If we are collecting one hundred thousand refuge prayers as the first of the four great preliminary guides ·we can count the refuge prayer at this point. We can either collect the prayers from the sadhana or we can collect the following short prayer: I go for refuge to the Gurus, Buddhas, Dharmas, and Sanghas. After reciting the prayer a hundred times, or as many times as we wish, we imagine that lights and nectars in five colours descend from each of the refuge objects. They dissolve into us and purify all our negative actions, especially those committed against our Gurus, the Buddhas, the Dharma, and the Sangha. We have committed many such negative actions. We may have been angry with our Gurus or the Buddhas or behaved dis-respectfully towards them. We may have lost our faith in them, or broken the commitments and promises we made to them. We may have temporarily abandoned the Dharma, or developed an aversion to listening to Dharma teachings or to practising Dharma. We may have been critical of the Sangha or behaved disrespectfully towards them. As we recite the prayers and visualize the lights and nectars descending we imagine that all these unwholesome actions, created in this and all our previous lives, are purified, and that our lifespan, merit, and Dharma realizations increase. GENERATING BODHICHITTA The practice of Mahayana refuge includes developing renunci-ation and compassion, both of which are essential factors for generating bodhichitta. The more we train in Mahayana refuge, the stronger our bodhichitta will become. The root of bodhichitta is compassion. The principal means for developing compassion is contemplating the suffering of others and trying to develop the wish that all beings be freed from their suffering. This compassionate wish needs to be 50"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES developed strongly so that it arises spontaneously at all times and influences all our thoughts and actions. Compassioninc.uces a superior intention. With this we see the inadequacy of merely wishing to free others from suffering and we make the definite decision, 'I myself will act to free all beings from their suffering'. We realize that to liberate all living beings from suffering we ourselves must first attain enlighten-ment. Only then will we have the power to bring lasting happi-ness to all other beings. This strong desire, rooted in compassion, to attain enlighten-ment in order to benefit all beings is known as 'bodhichitta'. When bodhichitta arises spontaneously we enter the actual Mahayana paths. Je Tsongkhapa said that to enter the Maha-yana it is not enough merely to study Mahayana teachings; the only gateway to the Mahayana paths is actually to generate the spontaneous mind of bodhichitta. We should generate and enhance the mind of bodhichitta by reciting the bodhichitta prayer in the sadhana. This prayer contains the practices of aspiring bodhichitta, engaging bodhi-chitta, and the four immeasurables. The phrase 'Once I have attained the state of a complete Buddha' refers to the practice of aspiring bodhichitta. The phrase 'I shall free all sentient beings' refers to immeasurable equanimity, indicating that our compassion embraces all sentient beings without partiality. The phrase 'from the ocean of samsara's suffering' refers to immeasurable compassion. The phrase 'and lead them to the bliss of full enlightenment' refers to immeasurable love and immeasurable joy. Finally, the words 'For this purpose I shall practise the stages of Vajrayogini's path' refer to engaging bodhichitta. By practising the two stages of Vajrayogini's path we are actively engaging in the methods to attain enlightenment for the benefit of others. We may recite these prayers either in English or Tibetan. The purpose of reciting prayers is to remind u~ of their meaning. Our minds are weak in Dharma understanding so we must rely upon the support of verbal prayers. Just as a feeble, old person needs a walking stick, so we need to recite prayers to remind us to improve our bodhichitta. Before practising Secret Mantra we should train well in 51"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Lamrim, the stages of the path common to both Su tra and Tantra, and we should be familiar with the methods for gener-ating bodhichitta. The main foundation of successful practice of the two stages of Vajrayogini is to have developed the three principal realizations: renunciation, bodhichitta, and the correct view of emptiness. In addition to these we need to engage in the preliminary practices. Just as a strong foundation is needed to build a good house, so a firm foundation of training in the preliminaries and training in the three principal aspects of the path is essential for our Secret Mantra practice. If our practice of generation and completion stages of Secret Mantra has such a fim1 foundation it will become a quick method for attaining enlightenment. Our present state of mind is not permanent. It can change either into a negative mind such as anger, or into a positive mind such as the altruistic wish to attain enlightenment. At the moment our bodhichitta may be artificial because it is generated with effort, but with practice we can transform our primary mind into a real bodhichitta that arises spontaneously. We cannot develop compassion and bodhichitta merely by listening to teachings. We should be prepared to spend a long time training in the methods to develop them, both in and out of meditation. More detailed explanations of going for refuge, generating bodhichitta, and so forth can be found in Joyful Path of Good Fortune. Throughout our practice of the two stages of Vajrayogini we should continue to improve our bodhichitta. We should not discourage ourselves by thinking that we cannot practise Secret Mantra because we have not yet developed bodhichitta; we can train in both simultaneously. Secret Mantra and Lamrim should be practised together so that eventually we will achieve realiza-tions of both simultaneously. If we sow an apple seed and a pear seed at the same time and we water and nourish them equally, they will grow together and ripen together. Similarly, from now on we should begin to practise both Secret Mantra and Lamrim, and in the future we will accomplish their results together. These two practices are like friends who help and support each other. Both are indispensable if we are to progress to full enlightenment. 52"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES Tantric teachings give special methods to improve our bodhi-chitta and our understanding of emptiness. For example, there is one practice called 'generating the mind of all yogas' which is explained when Highest Yoga Tantra empowerments are given. To generate the mind of all yogas we first generate a mind of great compassion focusing on suffering sentient beings, and then we develop a strong wish to attain Buddhahood for their sake. This is conventional bodhichitta. Without losing this wish we then remember that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence. This is ultimate bodhichitta. At our heart we visualize our conventional bodhichitta in the form of a very small moon cushion lying flat. At the centre of the moon cushion we visualize a white five-pronged vajra standing vertic-ally and identify this as our ultimate bodhichitta. Imagining that the moon and vajra are very firm and stable, and are radiating light, we hold this visualization without distraction for as long as possible. We should constantly recall this experience throughout the day. For skilful meditators the practices of generation stage and completion stage are the supreme methods to improve their conventional and ultimate bodhichitta. RECEIVING BLESSINGS As mentioned before, the Gurus, Yiciams, and Buddhas are emanations of Guru Vajradharma' s mind, the assembled Dharma Jewels are emanations of Guru Vajradharrna's speech, and the assembled Sangha Jewels are emanations of Guru Vajra-dharrna's body. With this in mind, we recite from the sadhana the special request prayer to receive the blessings of the Three Jewels. We imagine that as a result of making these requests with strong faith, the group of Sangha Jewels melts into white light. This light dissolves into our crown and our body receives the blessings of Guru Vajradharrna's body. Then the assembly of Dharma Jewels melts into red light. This light dissolves into our throat and our speech receives the blessings of Guru Vajradhar-ma's speech. The Gurus, Yidams and Buddhas then melt into 53"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Vajrayogini"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES blue light. This light dissolves into our heart and our mind receives the blessings of Guru Vajradharma's mind. By receiv-ing these blessings all our faults and negative actions of body, speech, and mind are purified, and our actions of body, speech, and mind transform into spiritual paths. INSTANTANEOUS SELF-GENERATION AS V AJRA YOGIN! After receiVmg the blessings of Guru Vajradharma's body, speech, and mind, we imagine that the entire world system, together with all its inhabitants, melts into light and dissolves into our body. Our body also melts into light and slowly dimin-ishes in size until it finally dissolves into emptiness. This resembles the way in which all the appearances of this life dissolve at death. We meditate single-pointedly on emptiness without permitting any conventional appearance to arise. We imagine that our mind mixes completely with ~~mptiness and we develop the recognition 'I am the Dharmakaya, the Truth Body, of Vajrayogini'. This is called 'bringing death into the path ohhe Truth Body'. From the Truth Body we instantly transform into an oval of red light, about eighteen inches high and twelvt: inches wide, standing vertically on an eight-petalled lotus and a sun cushion. This transformation resembles the way in which the body of the bardo being arises out of the clear light of death. We develop the recognition 'I am the Sambhogakaya, the Enjoyment Body of Vajrayogini'. This is called 'bringing the intermediate state into the path of the Enjoyment Body'. Now the red oval of light, in nature our own mind, increases in size and transforms into the Nirmanakava, the Emanation Body of Vajrayogini. We generate the divine pride 'I am Vajra-yogini'. This resembles leaving the intermediate state and taking rebirth. It is known as 'bringing rebirth into the .path of the Emanation Body'. Those who wish to practise Vajrayogini Tantra daily, but have insufficient time or ability to practise either the extensive or the middling sadhana, can fulfil the commitment taken during the 55"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Vajrayogini empowerment to generate as the Deity by practising the following sequence. First we go for refuge, generate bodhi-chitta, and dissolve the objects of refuge as explained earlier. Then we meditate on bringing death, intermediate state, and rebirth into the path and generate as the Deity Vajrayogini, as just described. We then visualize that at our heart, inside a red phenomena-source and on top of a moon cushion, there is a red letter BAM. Circling counter-clockwise around this there is the mantra of Vajrayogini: OM OM OM SARWA BUDDHA DAKI-NIYE VAJRA WARNANIYE VAJRA BEROTZANTYE HUM HUM HUM PHAT PHAT PHAT SOHA. With strong faith we concentrate on the BAM and mantra letters and recite the mantra as many times as possible, or at least as many times as we promised to during the Vajrayogini empowerment. Finally, we recite a short prayer of dedication. It is also possible to perform a brief self-generation practice in conjunction with the short sadhana called Dakini Yoga, which can be found in Appendix II. This sadhana is helpful for busy practitioners because it combines the essential stages of self-generation as Vajrayogini with Six-session Guru Yoga. How-ever, we should not be satisfied with only short practices. If we want to achieve Buddhahood by relying on Vajrayogini we definitely need to practise the eleven yo gas extensively. BLESSING THE INNER OFFERING This has five parts: 1 The benefits 2 The basis of the inner offering 3 The visual object of the inner offering 4 How to bless the inner offering 5 The significance of the inner offering The benefits The practice of inner offering is found only in Highest Yoga Tantra. Inner offering can be used as an offering to the holy 56"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES beings, for ourselves as in the yoga of experiencing nectar, or to avert external or internal obstacles. Blessing and tasting the inner offering is a cause of many levels of completion stage realization. Through this practice we can purify our five con-taminated aggregates and elements and transform them into the five Buddha Families, and we can purify the five delusions and transform them into the five omniscient wisdoms. Making the inner offering acts as a cause to increase our lifespan, to accumulate merit, and to experience great bliss. The basis of the inner offering The inner offering is so called because its basis is a collection of five meats and five nectars, all of which are inner substances, or substances derived from the bodies of sentient beings. Torma and tsog offerings are based upon external substances which are not obtained from the body and so they are called 'outer offerings'. For the inner offering, the basis and the visual object are different, whereas for the outer offerings they are the same. The visual object of the inner offering We set up in front of us a real skullcup, or a vessel of similar shape, or any small container that has a lid. Into this container we pour black tea or alcohol, and into this we put a nectar pill that has· been blessed by our Guru or received from a Dharma practitioner of the same lineage as ourself. This is the visual object. Focusing on this, we proceed to bless the inner offering. How to bless the inner offering This has four parts: 1 Clearance 2 Purification 3 Generation 4 Transformation 57"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Clearance 'Clearance' here means to clear, or to drive away, obstacles such as harmful spirits who might interfere with the blessing of the inner offerings. This is done by reciting the mantra OM KHANDAROHI HUM HUM PHAT. Among the many Deities of the Heruka mandala, the wrathful female Deity Khandarohi is the Deity responsible for dispelling obstacles and hindrances. She is also known as the 'Goddess of Action' and her mantra is called the 'action mantra'. While reciting this mantra we imagine countless Khandarohi goddesses manifesting from our heart. They disperse in all directions and drive away any negat-ive forces that might obstruct the blessing of the inner offering. When this has been accomplished the goddesses are reabsorbed into our heart. Purification In this context, 'purification' means purifying our ordinary appearances and conceptions, including self-grasping, by means of meditation. It is necessary to purify the ten substances before we can transform them into nectar. To do this, we focus on the visual object of the inner offering and contemplate that it and all other phenomena, including ourselves, are empty of inherent existence. At the same time we recite the mantra OM SOBHAWASHUDDHASARWADHARMASOBHAWASHUDDHO HAM, followed by the phrase 'Everything becomes emptiness'. The mantra summarizes the meditation on emptiness. OM refers to the visual object of the inner offering, SARWA DHARMA means 'all phenomena', and SOBHAWA SHUDDHO means 'lack inherent existence'. The whole mantra, therefore, means: 'All phenomena including the visual object of the inner offering are empty of inherent existence'. After reciting 'Everything becomes emptiness' we meditate briefly on emptiness, the lack of inherent existence. We imagine that all conventional appearances have dissolved into empti-ness, identify this emptiness as emptiness of inherent existence, and then try to mix our mind with this emptiness. 58"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES Generation This has two parts: 1 Generating the container 2 Generating the contained substances GENERATING THE CONTAINER We visualize: From the state of emptiness a blue letter YAM appears. This is the seed of the wind .element and its nature is the wisdom of great bliss and emptiness. The YAM transforms into a gigantic wind mandala. This is blue, semi-circular in shape, and lies flat with its curved edge furthest from us. At both corners there is a fluttering white banner. The movement of the banners activates the wind mandala causing the wind to blow. Above the wind mandala there appears a red letter RAM. This is the seed of the fire element and its nature is the wisdom of great bliss and emptiness. This letter transforms into a triangular fire mandala which is flat and red. It has one corner pointing towards us, directly above the straight edge of the wind mandala, and the other two corners above the semi-circular edge of the wind mandala. This red triangle, which is slightly smaller than the wind mandala, is the core of the fire mandala. As this core is fanned by the wind, red-hot flames blaze and cover the whole wind mandala. Above the fire mandala there appear three AH letters of different colours. The letter AH above the eastern point, the point closest to us, is white; the letter above the northern point, 1~0 our right, is red; and the letter above the southern point, to our left, is blue. These letters transform into three large human heads in the same colours as the letters from which they developed. A large white letter AH, which symbolizes emptiness, appears above the centre of the three heads. This transforms into a vast skullcup, white outside and red inside, which rests on top of the heads. 59"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND GENERATING THE CONTAINED SUBSTANCES To generate the contained substances we should visualize the following. Inside the skullcup there instantly appear the ten letters OM, KHAM, AM, TRAM, HUM, LAM, MAM, PAM, TAM, BAM. Gradually these letters transform into the five meats and the five nectars. In the east, the part of the skullcup nearest to us, the white letter OM transforms into yellow excrement which is marked by a radiant white OM, the seed of Vairochana. In the north, to our right as we look, the green letter KHAM transforms into white brains marked by a radiant green KHAM, the seed of Amoghasiddhi. In the west the red letter AM transforms into white sperm marked by a radiant red AM, the seed of Amitabha. In the south the yellow letter TRAM transforms into red blood marked by a radiant yellow TRAM, the seed of Ratnasambhava. In the centre the blue HUM transforms into blue urine, marked by a radiant blue HUM, the seed of Akshobya. In the south-east the white letter LAM transforms into a black corpse of a cow marked by a radiant white LAM, the seed of Lochana. In the south-west the blue MAM transforms into a red corpse of a dog marked by a radiant blue MAM, the seed of Mamaki. In the north-west the red PAM transforms into a white corpse of an elephant marked by a radiant red PAM, the seed of Benzarahi. In the north-east the green TAM transforms into a green corpse of a horse marked by a radiant green TAM, the seed of Tara. In the centre the red BAM transforms into a red human corpse marked by a radiant red BAM, the seed of Vajravarahi. All the corpses lie on their backs and are marked at the heart by their respective letters. The human corpse lies in the urine with its head pointing away from us. All the other corpses lie with their heads towards the centre of the skullcup. In summary, from inside the vast skullcup there arise the ten letters, the seed letters of the five Buddha Fathers and the five Buddha Mothers. These ten letters transform into the ten inner substances which constitute the basis of the inner offering. Those with no understanding of emptiness should not try to visualize the ten substances too clearly. Otherwise they might 60"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES feel they are visualizing real excrement and urine, and instead of being able to transform it into nectar they will feel disgusted! This has three parts: 1 Purifying faults Transformation 2 Transforming into nectar 3 Increasing PURIFYING FAULTS We contemplate: Light rays radiate from the letter BAM at our heart and strike the two banners of the wind mandala, causing them to flutter. This causes the wind mandala to blow, which in turn cat~ses the fire mandala to blaze. The heat from the fire mandala causes the ten seed letters that mark the substances and the ten substances themselves to boil. They all melt together into a hot, orange liquid. As the letters mix with the ten substances, the unpleasant colours, tastes, and smells of those substances are purified. TRANSFORMING INTO NECTAR We contemplate: Above the orange liquid a white letter HUM appears. This is the nature of Heruka's mind, the wisdom of indivisible great bliss and emptiness. The HUM transforms into a white upside-down khatanga. The substance of the khatanga is white bodhichitta and its nature is Heruka's mind. Due to the heat of the boiling liquid below, the white khatanga begins to melt and drip into the skullcup, as butter melts when close to steam. The melted white khatanga swirls three times counter-clockwise inside the skullcup and then mixes completely with the liquid. The liquid becomes cool a1;1d sweet and takes on the colour of mercury. Due to the mixing of the khatanga, the liquid transforms into nectar possessing three qualities: it is a medicine-nectar that prevents all diseases, it is a life-nectar that destroys death, and it is a wisdom-nectar that eradicates all delusions. 61"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Whilst we are imagining that the liquid is transforming into nectar with the three qualities we need very firm and very strong concentration. INCREASING Directly above the nectar we visualize a row of Sanskrit vowels and consonants which are white in colour. In the centre is the first vowel, the letter OM. Starting from the right of the OM and extending from right to left there are the remaining vowels in the following sequence: A AA I II U UU RI RII LI LII E AI 0 AU AM AH. Starting to the left of the OM and extending from left to right there are the consonants in the following sequence: KA KHA GA GHA NGA CHA CHHA JA JHA NYA DA THA TA DHA NA DrA THrA TrA DHrA NA BA PHA PA BHA MAYA RA LA WA SHA KA SA HA KYA. Above this row of white letters there is a similar row of red letters, and above this there is a row of blue letters. The letters of each row are the same, differing only in colour. All three rows of letters are made of radiant light. We imagine that the row of white vowels and consonants gradually dissolves from both ends towards the centre and transforms into a white OM. In the same way, the row of red letters transforms into a red AH, and the row of blue letters transforms into a blue HUM. So now, above the nectar, there is a white letter OM, a red letter AH, and a blue letter HUM, one above the other. These three letters radiate brilliant light rays to the Buddha Lands of the ten directions, invoking the enjoyments of all Buddhas, Heroes, and Yoginis, and drawing all their wisdom-nectars into the three letters. The blue HUM turns upside-down, descends, and dissolves into the nectar, followed in the same way by the red AH and the white OM. The three letters mix with the nectar, causing it to become inexhaustible. To stabilize the transformation of the nectar we recite OM AH HUM three times. All these inner offering practices are done whilst reciting the appropriate words in the sadhana. At the conclusion of the blessing we should develop a strong conviction that in front of 62"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES us there is a special wisdom-nectar possessing the three qualit-ies. This nectar can now be used either for our own purposes or to benefit others. The significance of the inner offering When advanced meditators bless their inner offering they vis-ualize the various stages as external transformations, but at the same time, internally, they engage in completion stage practices that correspond to the stages of the blessing. Knowing the symbolism of the inner offering, they use the process of blessing that it to greatly enhance their completion stage practice. For example, during the blessing of the inner offering the wind mandala that is visualized symbolizes the downward-voiding winds that are located below the navel. Above the wind mandala there is the triangular-shaped fire mandala symboliz-ing the inner fire, or tummo, at the navel. Above the fire man-dala there are three human heads representing the minds of white appearance, red increase, and black near-attainment, the fifth, sixth, and seventh of the eight signs that occur when the winds have dissolyed within the central channel. Above the three heads there is a skullcup which symbolizes the mind of clear light, the eighth sign. The skullcup is white outside and red inside, symbolizing emptiness and great bliss respectively. The skullcup itself symbolizes the indivisible union of bliss and emptiness. Inside the skullcup there are the ten substances. The five nectars signify the five contaminated aggregates and the five meats symbolize the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and space, as well as the five principal delusions: confusion, miserliness, attachment, jealousy, and self-grasping. The con-taminated aggregates and elements are the principa:t basis that is to be purified during completion stage practice. Their genera-tion inside the skullcup of bliss and emptiness symbolizes their purification and transformation. In general, meat symbolizes the flesh of the four maras that are slain by Tantric practitioners with the weapon of their wis-dom. Each of the five meats also has a special significance. Cows are very dull and stupid, so the meat of the cow symbolizes 63"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND confusion. The meat of the dog symbolizes miserliness because dogs are very possessive and miserly. Although a dog usually cannot enjoy its master's possessions it will nevertheless guard them diligently and attack anyone who threatens them. Ele-phant meat symbolizes attachment. Horse meat symbolizes jeal-ousy because horses are very competitive. When they run together and one horse moves ahead, the others jealously chase after it. Human flesh symbolizes self-grasping because most humans have an inflated sense of their own importance. These delusions must be purified because they are the main cause of developing both contaminated aggregates and contaminated elements. The fluttering of the banners on the wind mandala symbolizes the downward-voiding winds ascending. The blazing fire is symbolic of the blazing of the inner fire, or tummo. Through the blazing of the inner fire, the winds gather and dissolve within the central channel, inducing the three signs symbolized by the three human heads on top of the fire mandala. The skullcup on top of the three human heads symbolizes the mind of clear light that manifests after the energy-winds have com-pletely dissolved within the central channel. Through medi-tating on the clear light the five contaminated aggregates are purified and transform into the five Buddha Fathers, and the five contaminated elements are purified and transform into the five Buddha Mothers. This is symbolized by the ten substances transforming into wisdom-nectar. In summary, blessing the inner offering indicates the basis that needs to be purified, the path that purifies, and the results of purification - the basis, path, and result of completion stage practice. When we have understood this and can combine our understanding with the practice of blessing the inner offering, we will begin to appreciate the real significance of this profound practice. Marpa Lotsawa said that tasting the nectar of his inner offer-ing was mote powerful than receiving one hundred initiations from other Lamas. This may seem to be a boastful statement, but when we thoroughly understand the inner offering's special qualities we will realize the profound truth of Marpa's words. When we bless our inner offering the basis of the offering is 64"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES the ten inner substances, but the visual object of the offering is a nectar pill dissolved in alcohol. When we bless torma and tsog offerings, the visual object of the offerings and the basis of the offerings are the same, both having the aspect of nectar food for eating. Apart from these differences the four stages of clearance, purification, generation, and transformation are the same when blessing inner offering, tsog offerings, and torma offerings. The process for making nectar pills that was mentioned in the yoga of experiencing nectar is also similar to the process for blessing the inner offering. However, there are some differences with regard to the visualized basis upon which the pills are established, the substances that are used, and the number of OM AH HUM mantras that are recited during the blessing. BLESSING THE OUTER OFFERINGS This has two parts: 1 General explanation 2 How to bless the outer offerings General explanation There are traditionally eight outer offerings which are some-times followed by a further six. Listed in the order in which they are offered, the eight offerings are: nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, flowers, incense, light, perfume, food, and music. The purpose of making these offerings to the Gurus, Yidams, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas is to increase our stock of merit or good fortune and thereby to create the main cause for our wishes to be fulfilled. More specifically, by offer-ing food and nectar we will gain freedom ·from the suffering of poverty and achieve the enjoyments of the Buddhas. By offering bathing water and perfume we create the cause to be free from samsaric rebirths and to attain the Form Body of a Buddha. By offering beautiful flowers we will experience freedom from 65"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND sickness, ageing, and other bodily ailments, and we will attain the special attributes of the body of a Buddha. By offering incense we create the caus~ to keep pure moral discipline and achieve pure concentration. By offering lights we will become free from the inner darkness of ignorance and achieve omniscient wisdom. Offering beautiful music creates the cause never to have to hear unpleasant sounds but only to hear pleas-ant sounds, especially the sound of Dharma, and to receive only good news. It is also a cause of attaining the speech of a Buddha. Knowing these benefits, we should try to make outer offerings every day, at least mentally. All Buddhist practitioners should keep a statue or a picture of Buddha Shakyamuni and regard this as the living Buddha. Practitioners of these special Vajrayogini instructions should also keep statues or pictures of Je Tsongkhapa and Vajrayogini and regard these as they would the living Je Tsongkhapa and Vajrayogini. In front of these representations of the Buddhas, Gurus, and Yidams we arrange three sets of offerings. The first set is to the Field for Accumulating Merit visualized in the practice of Guru yoga. The second is an offering to the in-front-generated Deity visualized during the torma offering, and the third set is an offering made to ourself generated as the Deity. We can arrange more than three sets if we wish. We can set out a hundred rows of offerings, or even more, if we have the time. According to Mother Tantra, offerings are made starting from the left hand of the Deity. Thus, offerings to the self-generation should be set out starting from our left, and offerings to in-front-generated Deities should be arranged starting from our right, and placed in the order already explained. When we set out the eight offerings, traditionally the first two and the sixth are water, but we should regard them as nectar. In front of us, on a small table, we place in a row from our right to left a damaru, a bell, a vajra, and our inner offering. The bell faces us with the vajra to its right, just touching it. The other opjects should be placed a little apart. 66"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES How to bless the outer offerings This has four parts: 1 Clearance 2 Purification 3 Generation 4 Actual blessing Clearance For the clearance stage of the blessing we recite OM KHANDA-ROHI HUM HUM PHAT and visualize either ten or countless wrathful Khandarohi goddesses emanating from the letter BAM at our heart. These goddesses drive away all spirits who try to interrupt us. We then reabsorb the goddesses into our heart. Purification While reciting the mantra OM SOBHAWA SHUDDHA SARWA DHARMA SOBHA WA SHUDDHO HAM we mE~ditate on the emptiness of inherent existence of the eight offering substances and of all phenomena. This practice purifies our ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions. Generation We visualize the following: From the state of emptiness eight KAM letters instantaneously appear in the space in front of us. These eight letters, which have the nature of great bliss and emptiness, transform into eight skullcups. Inside each skullcup a letter HUM appears. These letters, which are in nature indivisible bliss and emp.tiness, trans-form into the individual offerings: drinking water, water for bathing, and so on. Each offering has three attributes: its nature is the wisdom union of great bliss and emptiness, its aspect is that of the particular outer offering, and its function is to cause those who enjoy the offering to experience special uncontaminated bliss. 67"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Actual blessing Above each skullcup we visualize the three letters OM AH HUM, one above the other, and then we recite the appropriate blessing mantra. For each blessing mantra we insert the Sanskrit name of the offering between OM and AH HUM. The names of the eight outer offerings are: AHRGHAM, drinking water; P ADAM, water for bathing the feet; V AJRA PUPE, flowers; V AJRA DHUPE, incense; VAJRA DIWE, lights; V AJRA G.ANDHE, perfume; V AJRA NEWIDE, food; and VAJRA SHAPTA, music. Thus to bless drink-ing water, for example, we recite the blessing mantra OM AHRGHAM AH HUM. After verbally blessing each offering in this way we imagine that the letter HUM above each skullcup dissolves into the offer-ing, followed by the letters AH and OM. In this way the offerings are blessed and transform into the nature of the wisdom union of great bliss and emptiness possessing the three attributes. OM is the seed-letter of all Buddhas' bodies, AH the seed of all Buddhas' speech, and HUM the seed of all Buddhas' mind. The letters OM AH HUM, therefore, symbolize the body, speech, and mind of all the Buddhas. These three letters are the source of all the mantras of the Gurus, Buddhas, Yidams, and Dharma Protectors, and when we recite this mantra we invoke the great power of all these holy beings. Despite its brevity, this is one of the most blessed and powerful of all mantras. If we recite it with conviction and strong faith we will receive the blessings of all the Buddhas. While we recite the blessing mantra we can perform the accompanying hand gestures, which symbolize and bless each offering. Illustrations of the various gestures can be found in Appendix III. While we recite the blessing mantra for the music offering we play the damaru and bell. The bell symbolizes clear light wisdom. We hold the bell in the left hand and play it at heart-level to symbolize the experience of clear light, which arises through the dissolution of the inner winds within the central channel at the heart. To attain the wisdom of clear light through meditation we need to ignite and increase the inner fire, and this is symbolized by playing the damaru. The vajra and damaru should be held in the right hand. The damaru is 68"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES played at the level of the navel because the inner fire is ignited by concentrating on the navel channel wheel. First we begin by playing the damaru and we imagine that it ignites our inner fire. Then we accompany it by playing the bell briefly, signifying the subsequent experience of clear light. Playing the instru-ments in this way sows in our mind a special propensity to achieve these attainments in the future. The six additional outer offerings are also known by their Sanskrit names. They are: V AJRA ADARSHE, indestructible form -we imagine all visual forms appear as Rupavajra goddesses; V AJRA WIN!, indestructible sound - all sounds arise as Shapta-vajra goddesses; V AJRA GANDHE, indestructible scent -all smells arise as Gandhavajra goddesses; V AJRA RASE, indestruc-tible taste - all tastes appear as Rasavajra goddesses; V AJRA P ARSHE, indestructible tangibles - all tangible objects arise as Parshavajra goddesses; and V AJRA DHARME, indestructible phenomena - all other phenomena appear as Dharmadhatu-vajra goddesses. MEDITATION AND RECITATION OF VAJRASATTVA This has three parts: 1 Developing the intention to purify 2 Visualizing Vajrasattva 3 Reciting the mantra Developing the intention to purify Sometimes we feel that our relatives and friends cause our happiness and that our enemies cause our suffering and prob-lems, but in fact all our happiness is the result of our own virtuous actions and all our suffering is the result of our own negative karma. Although, even in our dreams, it is our con-stant wish to be free from misery, suffering, fear, and danger, we will never enjoy these freedoms until we have purified all the negative actions we have accumulated in this and previous lives. Purification is very important for everyone, but it is 69"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND especially important for Dharma practitioners who wish to gain realizations of Sutra and Tantra. The negative actions we have created in the past are the main obstacles to our attainment of Dharma realizations and the fulfilment of our spiritual wishes. Out of his compassion for sentient beings, Buddha taught many methods for purifying negative actions. Among these, one supremely powerful method is meditation arid recitation of Vajrasattva. In Root Text of the Mahamudra, the Main Path of the Conquerors, the first Panchen Lama wrote: And since the realization of the ultimate nature of the mind Depends upon accumulating merit and purifying obstructions, You should first recite the hundred-letter mantra a hundred thousand times And make as many hundreds of prostrations as possible whilst reciting Confession of Moral Downfalls, And then from the depths of your heart you should make requests again and again To your root Guru who is inseparable from All the Buddhas of the three times. Visualizing Vajrasattva We imagine that at our crown there appears a white, thousand-petalled lotus and a moon cushion. Upon the moon cushion sit Vajrasattva Father and Mother. They have white-coloured bodies and are in nature one with Guru Heruka. The Father holds a vajra in his right hand and a bell in his left. His arms are crossed embracing his consort Vajramanani, and he sits in the vajra posture. He is adorned with six types of bone mudra-ornament: crown ornament, earrings, necklace, heart ornament, bracelets and anklets, and ashes of bone spread on his body. Vajramanani holds a curved knife in her right hand and a skullcup in her left. She is adorned with the first five mudra-ornaments, but not the ashes. She sits in the lotus posture, so called because her legs make a shape similar to a lotus as she embraces Vajrasattva. 70"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES They are to be regarded as the real, living Vajrasattva and consort. Their bodies are the synthesis of all Sangha Jewels, their speech the synthesis of all Dharma Jewels, and their minds the synthesis of all Buddha Jewels.

Reciting the mantra This has three parts: 1 The mantra to be recited 2 How to combine the recitation with purification 3 Conclusion The mantra to be recited There are four kinds of hundred-letter mantra: the hundred-letter mantras of Heruka, Yamantaka, Vajrasattva, and the Pama lineage. All four mantras are the same for the most part, the main difference being the name of the Yidam found at the beginning of the mantra. Thus, in the hundred-letter mantra of Heruka we recite OM VAJRA HERUKA SAMAYA ..• and so on; in the hundred-letter mantra of Yamantaka we recite OM YAMANTAKA SAMAYA ... ; in the hundred-letter mantra of Vajrasattva we recite OM V AJRASA TIC SAMA YA . . . ; and in the mantra of the Pama lineage we recite OM P AMASA TIC SAMA Y A . . . The remaining letters of the manb:as are mostly the same. In the practices of Heruka and Vajrayogini we recite the hundred-letter mantra of Heruka. In general, Vajrasattva and Vajradhara have the same nature, differing only in shape, colour, and ornaments. This is like someone expressing different aspects of their nature by wearing different clothes. In the Guhyasamaja Tantra, Vajradhara said that there are one hundred Buddha Families. These hundred Families can be condensed into five; these can be condensed into three; and these can be condensed into one: Vajradhara, 71"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND or Vajrasattva. The hundred-letter mantra symbolizes the hun-dred Buddha families and has the same nature as these families. How to combine the recitation with purification This has two parts: 1 General explanation 2 Purification in seven rounds GENERAL EXPLANATION To combine the recitation of the mantra with purification we must first develop a strong sense of regret for all the negative actions we have committed in this life and in countless previous lives. All unhappiness, problems, fears, dangers, and unfulfilled wishes are the result of our harmful actions. In what way do negative actions produce suffering? Let us take a single act of killing as an example. This action will result in four effects of great suffering. As its ripened effect we will take rebirth in an unfortunate realm. As its environmental effect, when eventually we are born human, our birthplace and living environment will be -very poor and barren, and we will meet many hazards and problems. As the experience similar to the cause, when we take a human form our body will be ugly and deformed. We will have to undergo much physical pain and our lifespan will be short. Finally, as the tendency similar to the cause, in future lives we will have a natural tendency to kill, taking delight in hunting, warfare, etc. Th~se impulses will lead us to create the causes to be reborn in the lower realms again and again. All non-virtuous actions, even the tiniest, produce these four great sufferings. However much we may wish to advance spiritually, we will find it difficult to make any progress until we have purified these negative actions. Through contemplating the faults and dangers of negative actions we develop intense regret and make a firm determination not to commit negative actions in the future. We keep this regret and determination in our mind and then take refuge in Guru Vajrasattva at our crown, regarding 72"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES him as the synthesis of the Three Jewels. Remembering the words of Shantideva in Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life: But I may die before I purify All my negativities; 0 please protect me so that I May swiftly and surely be free from them. we mentally supplicate Vajrasattva: Please protect me and all sentient beings from the dangers of negative actions and their effects. Then we recite the mantra. First we visualize on a moon cushion at Father Vajrasattva's heart a white letter HUM encircled by the white hundred-letter mantra standing counter-clockwise. All the letters radiate light and have the wisdom nature of Guru Vajrasattva. The hundred letters of the mantra are inseparable from the hundred Buddha Families. While reciting the mantra, we mentally request Vajrasattva to protect us <md all living beings from the misery of our negative actions and their effects. For this purification practice to be effective we must correctly apply four opponent powers. Developing regret for the negative actions we have performed in the past is the power of destruc-tion, resolving not to repeat the action is the power of promise, taking refuge in Guru Vajrasattva is the power of reliance, and reciting the mantra is the power of the antidote. PURIFICATION IN SEVEN ROUNDS We can combine mantra recitation with purification in seven rounds. These are: dispelling negativity from above, dispelling negativity from below, destroying negativity at the heart, puri-fication through receiving the vase empowerment:, purification through receiving the secret empowerment, purification through receiving the wisdom-mudra empowerment, and puri-fication through receiving the word empowerment. The first three are general practices and the remaining four are practices unique to Highest Yoga Tantra. 73"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Dispelling negativity from above To practise the first round of meditation, we begin by recollecting the feeling of regret and determination not to commit negative actions in the future. Then we focus our attention on the hundred-letter mantra at Guru Vajrasattva's heart and generate strong conviction and faith in Guru Vajrasattva and the power of his mantra. We recite the mantra verbally or mentally seven or more times and then imagine that white light and nectar descend from the mantra letters. They leave through the point of union of Guru Vajrasattva Father and Mother and enter our body through our crown. We visualize all our negative actions and delusions in the aspect of sooty liquid, all our ailments and sufferings in the aspect of pus, blood, and mucus, and all hindrances from spirits in the aspect of snakes, spiders, and scorpions. As our body fills with light and nectar we imagine that all these impurities are pushed down from the upper part of our body and leave through our lower doors. They ,descend to the depths of the earth where they enter the mouth of the Lord of Death. We imagine that he is fully satiated. Our body fills with wisdom light and nectar and transforms into a body of light, free from all faults of sickness, ageing, and death. We meditate on this pure body of light single-pointedly. Dispelling negativity from below We recall our previously generated regret, determination, and faith in the power of this practice to purify negativities, and then we recite the mantra seven times or more. As before, we visualize light and wisdom-nectar descending and filling our body. We imagine that this causes all our negative actions, sickness, sufferings, and delusions in the form of smoke, pus, blood, snakes, spiders, and scorpions to rise up from the lower parts of our body and leave through our mouth and nostrils. They then disperse and disappear completely into space. This method is like cleaning the inside of a dirty bottle. As water is poured in from the top and the water level inside rises, the dirt floating on the surface is forced out through the mouth of the bottle, leaving it completely clean inside. 74"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF IMMEASURABLES Destroying negativity at the heart We visualize all our bad karma, sickness, sufferings, and delusions in the form of a mass of black light at our heart and then develop the three necessary conditions of regret, determination, and faith. We recite the mantra seven times or more. Then: we visualize light and nectar descending and entering our body through our crown. When they reach our heart aU our negative actions, sicknesses, and so forth are dispelled, disappearing all at once, just as darkness is instantly dispelled when a light is switched on. Purification through receiving the vase empowerment To receive the vase empowerment and the blessings of Guru Vajra-sattva's body, we first recollect the three conditions and recite the mantra for a short time. Then we imagine that light and wisdom-nectar descend and fill our entire body, purifying our negative physical actions such as killing, stealing, and so forth. We generate a feeling of great bliss and recognize that this feeling is the essence of the vase empowerment. This empower-ment ripens the seeds of our generation stage realizations as well as our potential to attain a Buddha's Emanation Body. Purification through receiving the secret empowerment To receive the secret empowerment and the blessings of Guru Vajrasattva's speech, we first recollect the three conditions and recite the mantra as before. Then we imagine that wisdom light and nectar fill our body. We imagine that all our negative actions of speech such as harsh words, lying, criticism, and verbal retaliation are purified. This induces an experience of great bliss which is the essence of the secret empowerment. This ripens the seeds of our attainment of the illusory body and our potential to attain the Enjoyment Body of a Buddha. Purification through receiving the wisdom-mudra empower-ment To receive the wisdom-mudra empowerment, we recol-lect the three conditions, recite the mantra, and then imagine that wisdom light and nectar fill our body, purifying our nega-tive actions of mind such as harmful thoughts, wrong views, lack of faith, and disrespect to holy beings.

PuriD.cation through receiving the word empowerment To receive the word empowerment, we recollect the three con-ditions, recite the mantra, and then visualize that wisdom light and nectar fill our body, purifying all our downfalls, our broken commitments, and our transgressions of the Bodhisattva vows and the Tantric vows. The wisdom light and nectar confer upon us the blessings of Guru V ajrasattva' s body, speech, and mind, inducing an experience of great bliss, which is the nature of the word empowerment. This ripens the seeds of our completion stage realizations of the Union that Needs Learning and the Union of No More Learning. Sometimes we can practise the first three rounds and at other times the remaining four rounds. For practitioners emphasizing meditation on gathering and dissolving the inner winds into the central channel it is not necessary to practise the first two rounds. Conclusion When we have finished the meditation and recitation we feel that Guru Vajrasattva is delighted with us. We imagine that he slowly diminishes in size, dissolves into light, and enters our body through our crown. When he reaches our heart he dis-solves into our subtle mind, and our subtle body, speech, and mind become one with Vajrasattva's body, speech, and mind. We can do the meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva with the short prayers from the Vajrayogini sadhana or separately with the extensive Vajrasattva sadhana. When we do this prac-tice as one of the four great preliminary guides, we collect one hundred thousand recitations of the hundred-letter mantra.

As practitioners of Highest Yoga Tantra, we have a commitment to practise Guru yoga six times every day. Guru yoga is an especially powerful method that enables us to receive the blessings of the Buddhas and greatly increases our store of merit. By following the Sutra path alone it would take a thousand aeons to accumulate the vast amount of merit needed to attain Buddhahood, but, as Sakya Pandita observed, by wholeheartedly practising Guru yoga the same amount of merit can be accumulated in the brief span of one human life. Our mind is like a field. Purifying negative karma and accumulating merit are like clearing the field of obstructions and fertilizing it, and meditating on generation stage and completion stage is like sowing good seeds. However, these seeds will grow into a harvest of realizations only if they are watered by a rain of blessings from the Yidams and Buddhas. Practising Guru yoga is the means by which we receive these blessings. Training in reliance upon the Spiritual Guide, as explained in Joyful Path of Good Fortune, is the best method to enhance our Guru yoga practice. Yeshe Tsi:indru, a highly accomplished Lama, says in Essence of Nectar: 78"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU When disciples rely sincerely upon their Spiritual Guide, All the Buddhas naturally enter and abide within the Guru's body, And he, delighted with his disciples, accepts their offerings And blesses their mental continuum. At that time, the minds of the faithful disciples Receive the blessings of all the Buddhas. Thus maras, evil spirits, and delusions will not harm them, And they will naturally achieve the realizations of the spiritual grounds and paths. Many Dharma practitioners, such as Naropa, Dromtonpa, and Geshe Jayulwa, have attained instant, pure realizations of Sutra and Tantra through receiving the blessings of their Gurus. Animals are generally unable to generate virtuous. minds, but occasionally, through receiving the blessings of the Buddhas, they naturally generate minds such as compassion, love, and the wish to help others. If this occurs when an animal is about to die its mind will become peaceful and positive, and this will help it to achieve rebirth as a human or a god. Nagarjuna said that there is no living being who has not experienced the happiness of humans or gods through receiving the blessings of the Buddhas. Whether or not we receive the Buddhas' blessings through our Spiritual Guide depends upon how we view him or her. If we regard our Spiritual Guide as a Buddha, we will receive the blessings of a Buddha; if we view him as a Bodhisattva we will receive the blessings of a Bodhisattva; and if we see him as an ordinary being we will receive no blessings. Geshe Potowa said that whether our Guru is precious or not depends upon our own view and not upon the Guru's qualities. It does not matter whether our Spiritual Guide is an actual Buddha or not. If we lack faith in our Spiritual Guide we will gain nothing from him, even if he is a living Buddha. Con-versely, if our Spiritual Guide is an ordinary being but we regard him as a Buddha we will definitely receive Buddha's 79"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND blessings. The benefits of relying upon the Spiritual Guide and the methods for doing so in thought and deed are explained in detail in Lamrim. It is important that we train in reliance on the Spiritual Guide in accordance with the Lamrim instructions. Who is our root Guru? As Tantric practitioners, our root Guru is the Spiritual Teacher from whom we receive the empower-ment, transmission, and complete commentary of our main Yidam practice. Thus if our main practice is Vajrayogini, our root Guru is the Teacher who gave us the empowerment, trans-mission, and complete commentary of Vajrayogini. Some Vajrayogini practitioners may have more than one root Guru, but when they practise Guru yoga they should visualize Buddha Vajradharma and regard him as being the essence of all their Gurus, and with this recognition make prostrations, offerings, requests, and so forth. THE PRACTICE OF GURU YOGA This has six parts: 1 Visualization 2 Prostration 3 Offerings 4 Requesting the lineage Gurus 5 Receiving the blessings of the four empowerments 6 Absorbing the Gurus Visualization In the space in front of us, arisen from the omniscient wisdom of Guru Vajradharma and inseparable from emptiness, there is a celestial mansion which is square with four doorways, ornaments, and archways. It possesses all the essential architec-tural and ornamental features. In the centre of this mansion there is a precious jewelled throne supported by eight snow-lions. Upon this, on a lotus of various colours, a moon, and a sun cushion, sits our root Guru in the aspect of Buddha 80"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU Vajradharma. He has a red-coloured body, one face, and two hands, which are crossed at his heart and hold a vajra and bell. He is in the prime of his youth, adorned with silk garments and the appropriate jewel and bone ornaments. Around Guru Vajradharma there are the lineage Gurus. These are arranged in a counter-clockwise sequence, forming a square around Guru Vajradharma. In front of Guru Vajra-dharma there is the first lineage Guru, Buddha Vajradharma. In the sadhana it says Buddha Vajradhara. Buddha Vajradhara and Buddha Vajradharma are the same nature. Here, Buddha Vajradhara is appearing in the aspect of Buddha Vajradharma. To Buddha Vajradharma's left there is Vajrayogini, followed by Naropa, Pamtingpa, and Sherab Tseg. The next nine lineage Gurus, from Malgyur Lotsawa to Sonam Gyaltsan, are to Guru Vajradharma's left; the next nine Gurus, from Yarlungpa to Wangchug Rabtan, are behind him; the next nine Gurus, from Jetsun Kangyurpa to Ganden Dargyay, are to his right; and the last five Gurus, from Dharmabhadra to Losang Yeshe, are in front of him and to the right of Buddha Vajradharma. The complete list of the lineage Gurus can be found in the extensive sadhana. From Buddha Vajradharma to Lama Losang Yeshe Trijang Dorjechang there are thirty-seven lineage G~rus, but the total number of lineage Gurus can vary for different disciples. For example, if a practitioner's root Guru is Trijang Dorjechang, Trijang Dorjechang should be at the centre of his or her visualiz-ation, in the aspect of Guru Vajradharma. For that practitioner the last lineage Guru would then be Phabongkha Dechen Nyingpo and the lineage Gurus would number thirty-six. There-fore, the number of lineage Gurus is not fixed. We should visualize Buddha Vajradharma and Vajrayogini in their usual aspect. The remaining lineage Gurus are in the aspect of Hero Vajradharma. In the prime of theix youth, they have red-coloured bodies with one face and two hands. They sit in the vajra posture wearing the six bone ornaments. With their right hands they play damarus, and with their left hands they hold at the level of their hearts skullcups filled with nectar. Khatangas rest against the inside of their left elbows.

LAND the body of all Buddhas; at their throat there is a red AH, the symbol of the speech of all Buddhas; an!i at their heart there is a blue HUM, the symbol of the mind of all Buddhas. These three letters show that these Gurus are the synthesis of the Three Jewels. Visualizing our root and lineage Gurus in this way is called 'generating the commitment beings'. From the HUM at the heart of the Gurus, light rays radiate and invite all the Buddhas, Gurus, Yidams, and Dharma Protec-tors to come from their natural abodes. The natural abode of all Buddhas is the Nature Body, the ultimate nature of the omniscient mind. We then recite: OM VAJRA SAMADZA DZA HUM BAM HO Each becomes a nature which is the synthesis of all objects of refuge and we imagine that the invited wisdom beings dissolve into the commitment beings. Prostration Focusing on our Spiritual Guide on the cenh·al throne, we gen-erate three recognitions: that he is the embodiment of all Bud-dhas, that he is inseparable from Vajrayogini, and that his kindness exceeds that of all other Buddhas. In this way we generate deep faith and respect for our Spiritual Guide. With this mind offaith and respect we imagine that we emanate an infinite number of replicas of our own body which pervade the entire world, and that with these emanated bodies we make physical prostrations to our Guru. At the same time, with our palms pressed together, we recite the following praise while contemplating its meaning: Vajra Holder, my jewel-like Guru, Through whose kindness I can accomplish The state of great bliss in an instant, At your lotus feet humbly I bow.

This bliss is the supreme, quick path to Buddhahood that enables us to fulfil all our own wishes, and those of all other sentient beings.

If we constantly make prostrations to our Guru with our body, speech, and mind, every moment of our human life will have great meaning. Offerings We make the following seven offerings: 1 Outer offerings 2 Inner offering 3 Secret offering 4 Suchness offering 5 Offering our spiritual practice 6 Kusali tsog offering 7 Mandala offerings Outer offerings To make the eight outer offerings we recite the oHering prayers from the sadhana. As we offer each substance we imagine that countless offering goddesses emanate from the letter BAM at our heart and make the offerings to the Gurus. First innumer-able white Ahrghamvajra goddesses emanate, each one holding a vessel of nectar. These are followed by white Padamvajra goddesses holding vessels of bathing water, white Pupevajra goddesses holding flowers, smoke-coloured Dhupevajra god-desses holding incense, orange Diwevajra goddesses holding lights, green Gandhevajra goddesses holding vessels of per-fume, multicoloured Newidevajra goddesses holding precious bowls of food, and multicoloured Shaptavajra goddesses play-ing musical instruments. As we make each offering we perform the accompanying 83"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND hand gesture and recite the appropriate offering mantra. Thus, when we make the first offering, nectar for drinking, we eman-ate the Ahrghamvajra goddesses, perform the hand gesture of offering nectar for drinking, and recite OM AHRGHAM PARTI-TZA SOHA. Then the Ahrghamvajra goddesses are reabsorbed into our heart and we emanate the next set of goddesses, the Padamvajra goddesses, recite the appropriate offering mantra, and perform the accompanying hand gesture. Each of the eight offerings follows the same pattern. Next we offer the objects of enjoyment of the six senses such as beautiful forms, melodious sounds, and so forth. We imagine that countless Vajra goddesses such as Rupavajra goddesses emanate from the BAM at our heart to make the offerings. Each offering that the Gurus receive causes them to experience uncontaminated great bliss. The different Vajra goddesses are named after the Sanskrit word for their offering and they all have different aspects. Rupavajra goddesses are white and hold jewelled miri:ors reflecting all the visible forms of the universe; Shaptavajra goddesses are blue and play various instruments such as flutes; Gandhavajra g9ddesses are yellow and hold jewelled vessels filled with perfume; Rasavajra goddesses are red and hold jewelled containers filled with various foods; Parshavajra goddesses are green and hold an assortment of precious clQths, delightful to the touch; and Dharmadhatuvajra goddesses are white and hold phenomena-sources symbolizing the ultimate nature of phenomena. While we visualize these goddesses making the offerings we recite the offering mantras from OM AH V AJRA ADARSHE HUM up to OM AH V AJRA DHARME HUM and perform the accompanying hand gestures. These hand gestures are illustrated in Appendix III. Whenever we make these offerings, we imagine that all the visual forms that exist in the universe transform into Rupavajra goddesses, all sounds transform into Shaptavajra goddesses, all smells transform into Gandhavajra goddesses, all tastes trans-form into Rasavajra goddesses, all tangible objects transform into Parshavajra goddesses, and all other phenomena transform into Dharmadhatuvajra goddesses. These goddesses make offerings to the assembled Gurus and Deities, to the self-gener-ation, or to the assembly of the Deities of the body mandala. 84"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU Inner offering To make the inner offering we imagine that red offering god-desses emanate from our heart, scoop up some ne·ctar from the inner offering before us, and offer it to the Gurus. At the same time we dip our left ring finger into the nectar and flick some nectar into space whilst reciting the inner offering mantra OM GURU VAJRA DHARMA SAPARIWARA OM AH HUM. We imagine that the Gurus accept this offering and, as a result, experience spontaneous great bliss. The goddesses are then re-absorbed into our heart. Secret offering While reciting the prayers from the sadhana we imagine that countless attractive knowledge-goddesses emanate from our heart in the aspect of Vajrayogini. These knowledge-goddesses serve as Tantric consorts. They are of three types: Dakinis of the Twenty-four places, mudras with realizations of generation stage or the first stages of completion stage, and mudras with realizations of the union that needs learning or the Union of No More Learning. The goddesses absorb into one another to become one single Deity. She then embraces Guru Vajra-dharma, causing both of them to experience uncontaminated bliss. Suchness offering Through embracing, Guru Vajradharma Father and Mother experience an uncontaminated bliss that realizes suchness, the emptiness of all phenomena. This realization of indivisible bliss and emptiness is the 'suchness', or 'thatness', offering. Offering our spiritual practice At this point we offer our practice of the Tantric seven limbs. This is the supreme offering that delights our Guru more than any other. The Tantric seven limbs are our practices of purify-ing, rejoicing, ultimate bodhichitta, refuge, aspiring bodhi-chitta, engaging bodhichitta, and dedication. 85"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND The seven-limb practice is indispensable for practitioners of Highest Yoga Tantra. According to the teaching of Highest Yoga Tantra, ultimate bodhichitta is the wisdom of spontaneous bliss that realizes emptiness directly. This is the actual quick path leading to the Union of No More Learning. Before we can realize ultimate bodhichitta we must generate the two aspects of conventional bodhichitta, aspiring bodhichitta and engaging bodhichitta, and these depend upon going for refuge, accumu-lating merit, purifying negative actions, and making dedication. We can offer these seven limbs with the Tantric seven-limb prayer from the sadhana: I go for refuge to the Three Jewels And cQnfess individually all negative actions. I rejoice in the virtues of migrating beings And hold with my mind a Buddha's enlightenment. I go for r.efuge until I am enlightened To Buddha, Dharma, and the supreme Assembly, And to accomplish the aims of myself and others I shall generate the mind of enlightenment. Having generated the mind of supreme enlightenment I shall invite all sentient beings to be my guests And engage in the pleasing, supreme practices of enlightenment. May I attain Buddhahood to benefit migrators. The first four lines of this prayer come from the Vajra:panjara Tantra. According to the Highest Yoga Tantra interpretation, the first two lines concern purification, the third line concerns rejoicing, and the fourth line refers to training in ultimate bodhi-chitta. The phrase 'hold with my mind a Buddha's enlighten-ment' means to train in developing the wisdom of spontaneous bliss united with emptiness. This wisdom is the main cause of the enlightened mind of a Buddha. The first two lines of the second verse concern Mahayana refuge, and the last two indi-cate the practice of aspiring bodhichitta. In the last verse, the first three lines concern engaging bodhichitta and the Bodhi-sattva vows, and the last line is a dedication prayer. 86"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU Sometimes we can offer our experience of these seven limbs by imagining that our inner experiences transform into a variety of offerings such as flowers, beautiful gardens, parks, moun-tains, and lakes. We can offer to the Gurus any of our virtuous actions such as moral discipline, giving, patience, mental stabil-ization, or wisdom. All these offerings of our spiritual practice are called 'sublime offerings'. Kusali tsog offering 'Kusali' literally means 'possessor of virtue'. It is the rtame given to very special Dharma practitioners, like Shantideva, who appear to engage in little spiritual practice but who in fa,ct practise extensively and powerfully in secret. In the kusali tsog offering we use our imagination to offer our own body rather than offering external things. Because it is our most precious possession, it is far more powerful to offer our body to our Spiritual Guide by performing the kusali tsog offering than it is to offer other material things. The kusali tsog offering is said to resemble the ~ecret practices of kusali Yogis because it is made only mentally and other people cannot see it. The literal mean-ing of the word 'tsog' is 'collection'. In this context it refers to the vast collection of merit that is accumulated by making this offering. There are two ways to offer our body to the Gurus and the Buddhas. One way is to offer our body as a servant, as did Naropa, Milarepa, and Geshe Jayulwa. The other way is to generate a strong and clear determination to offer our body, mentally to transform it into nectar, and then to offer it to the holy beings and give it to all sentient beings. This method is similar to the 'white distribution' of the 'chod', or 'cutting', practice, the principal difference being that in the Rusali tsog we do not use ritual objects such as a large drum or a thigh-bone trumpet. Kusali tsog is an especially powerful practice of giving that can sever our self-cherishing and self-grasping. A similar effect can also be achieved through the practice of taking and giving, known in Tibetan as 'tong len'. Both practices greatly increase our accumulation of merit. 87"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND To practise the. kusali tsog offering we temporarily abandon our clear appearance of being the Deity and resume our ordin-ary form. Then we generate a special motivation by contemplat-ing the following: From beginningless time I have taken countless rebirths, and each time I had a body. Of all these bodies my present body is the only one that remains. All my previous bodies have dis-appeared; some were reduced to ashes by fire, some were buried in the ground, some were thrown into water, and some were eaten. To have taken all those forms would have been worthwhile if I had extracted some meaning from my past lives, but most of my lives were wasted. To have taken this present form will prove just as futile if I do not use this life in a meaningful way. My main aim is to achieve enlightenment as soon as possible so t~at I can benefit all living beings. To accomplish this I must use my body to create a gfeat wealth of merit. Whether I use it in a mean~ngful way or not, this body will be destroyed sooner or later, as were all my previous bodies. Therefore I must use my body now while I still have the opportunity. The best way to do this is by practising the kusali tsog. I will transform my body into nectar, offer it to the Gurus and Three Jewels, and give it to all sentient beings. Through this practice I will cut my self-cherishing and self-grasping and attain Buddhahood in order to protect all living beings. Having generated this motivation, we visualize that our mind is in the aspect of a letter BAM at our heart. Then we develop a strong wish to separate our mind from our body. Our mind, the letter BAM at our heart, transforms into a thumb-sized Vajrayogini, referred to in the sadhana as the 'powerful Lady of Dakini Land'. In this form our mind shoots up from our heart like an arrow, leaves our body through the crown of our head, and flies towards our Guru. Coming face to face with our root Guru, our mind-Vajrayogini then increases to the size of a woman of average height. We retain this form for the remainder of the kusali tsog offering. Now we transform our old body into a form that is suitable to offer. We imagine that we turn to look back at it and see that it has fallen to the ground, where it has become fat and oily, 88"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU and as huge as a mountain. Those who are ordained should visualize their old body in the aspect of a lay person and not as a monk or nun. As we move closer to this gigantic corpse three enormous human heads spontaneously appear. They are arranged in a triangle, like three stones arranged to support a cooking pot. We touch the forehead of the corpse with our curved knife and instantly the skin peels away and the skull cracks open. The skullcap falls away to form a ~~ant cup, or kapala, which is placed on the grate of three human heads. We chop the rest of the corpse into pieces and heap these into the skullcup. The pile of dismembered flesh and bones in the skullcup is as large as a mountain and it is surrounded by an ocean of blood, pus, and other bodily liquids. Our mind-Vajrayogini stares with wide-open eyes at the skullcup and the substances inside. As it is inappropriate to offer such impure substances to the holy beings, we must now bless these sub-stances and transform them into nectar. The blessing of the kusali tsog includes all the profound meaning of the blessing of the inner offering, and the visualiza-tion is very similar. The main difference is that on this occasion we need recite only OM AH HUM HA HO HRIH three times whilst performing the accompanying hand gestures. These six letters, accompanied by the hand gestures, contain the four stages of blessing that are found in the blessing of the inner offering. Clearance, usually the first stage, is the last stage in the kusali tsog blessing and it is accomplished through a hand gesture. Purification and generation are accomplished in associ-ation with the letters OM AH HUM, and transformation is accomplished in association with the letters HA HO HRIH. When we say OM, the right hand should be made into a fist at heart level. On top of this we place the left hand which is open with the palm facing outwards, the fingers pointing upwards, and the thumb tucked in. This gesture symbolizes the wisdom of clear light realizing emptiness. Generally in Secret Mantra the left side or left hand signifies wisdom realizing emptiness and the right signifies method. Mother Tantras such as Vajrayogini emphasize the development of the clear light of emptiness, and to remind us of this we should try t:o begin each physical action with our left. For example, when we start to 89"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND eat, we should pick up the cutlery with our left hand, and recall clear light emptiness. This helps us to maintain mindfulness throughout the day. The letter OM symbolizes the ultimate nature of our body, and all other phenomena. By reciting OM, performing the accompanying hand gesture, and briefly meditating on the emptiness of inherent existence of the skullcup and its contents, we overcome our ordinary appearance and ordinary concep-tions and thereby purify the skullcup and its contents. When we say AH, we make a similar gesture but with the left hand in a fist and the right hand upright. This gesture symbolizes method, indicating the generation of the conven-tionally existent offering container. When we focus our mind on the huge skullcup on top of the three human heads, this is similar to generating the skullcup from the syllable AH in the blessing of the inner offering. When we say HUM, we imagine that from a HUM inside the large skullcup the substances of our former body appear in the form of the five meats and five nectars. At the same time we perform the hand gesture symbolizing the ten substances. To make this gesture the hands are held at the level of the heart with the palms facing outwards, the tips of the thumbs touch-ing, and the finge:r;s outstretched. Inside the kapala, there are the five meats and the five nec-tars. By reciting HA HO HRIH we transform them into nectar. The letters HA HO HRIH have the same nature and the same meaning as the letters OM AH HUM which are used to bless the inner offering. Both signify the three Vajra Buddhas: Akshobya, Amitabha, and Vairochana. Akshobya is the Vajra Mind Buddha, the Buddha whose nature is the mind of all Buddhas; Amitabha is the Vajra Speech Buddha, whose nature is the speech of all Buddhas; and Vairochana is the Vajra Body Buddha, who is the essence of the bodies of all Buddhas. HRIH and HUM are the seed-letters of Buddha Akshobya, HA and AH are the seed-letters of Buddha Amitabha, and HO and OM are the seed-letters of Buddha Vairochana. In the space directly above the kapala we imagine a blue letter HRIH. This symbolizes the vajra mind, the nature of all Buddhas' minds. To the right of this letter we visualize a red 90"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU letter HA, the symbol of vajra speech, the nature of all Buddhas' speech, and to the left of the HRIH we visualize a white letter HO, the symbol of the vajra body, the nature of all Buddhas' bodies. As we recite HA HO HRIH these letters melt and fall into the skullcup, mixing with the ten substances. As the letters and substances mix together they transform into nectar possessing the three qualities, as explained in the inner offering. While reciting HA HO HRIH we perform the hand gesture of clearance, known as the 'Garuda mudra'. This; mudra symbolizes the Deity, Garuda, who appears as a terrifying bird. At one time the people of this world were afflicted by many terrible diseases caused by harmful naga-spirits. These diseases were extremely difficult to cure. After being requested by Vajrapani, Buddha Shakyamuni manifested as the Garuda and completely pacified the harmful actions of these malevolent beings. To make the Garuda hand gesture we touch the middle finger and thumb of each hand together and then touch the joined middle fingers and thumbs of both hands together. The tip of the right ring finger then crosses on top of the nail of the left ring finger and both little fingers touch at the tips and point away from us. The two index fingers point upwards. The spaces inside the touching middle finger and thumb symbolize the Garuda's eyes, the index fingers are the Garuda.'s horns, the two ring fingers the Garuda's tucked-in wings, and the two little fingers symbolize the Garuda' s tail. Seeing this hand gesture, naga-spirits remember the Garuda and immediately flee in panic. This gesture also drives away the many other spirits who harbour harmful thoughts against practitioners, as well as the spirits who try to interfere with the blessing of the kusali tsog. Now our old body has been blessed and transformed into nectar and is ready to be offered to the holy beings and given to ordinary beings. First we offer the nectar to the principal guest, our root Guru, Guru Vajradharma. To make offerings to our root Guru, we hold the inner offering container at the level of our forehead and recite the offering prayer from .the sadhana: 91"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Naropa"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU I offer this nectar of commitment substance To my root Guru, the nature of the four [Buddha) bodies; May you be pleased. At the same time we visualize that seven leading offering god-desses, together with many other goddesses, emanate from our heart. With their skullcups they scoop up nectar from the huge skullcup and offer it to our root Guru. At the end of the offering prayer we say OM AH HUM seven times. Each time we say OM AH HUM we dip our left ring finger into the nectar and flick a drop of nectar into space. We imagine that our root Guru is delighted with our offering and accepts it by drawing the nectar through his tongue of vajra light. This causes him to experience spontaneous great bliss. All the offering goddesses then re-absorb into our heart. After making offerings to our root Guru, we offer the nectar to the lineage Gurus of these instructions. Holding the inner offering container as before, we recite the next verse while imagining that many goddesses holding skullcups emanate from our heart. These goddesses scoop up nectar from the huge skullcup and offer it to the lineage Gurus who surround our root Guru. At the end of the verse we say OM AH HUM once and flick a drop of nectar away from us. We imagine that the lineage Gurus are pleased to accept the offering and then we reabsorb the offering goddesses. Next we hold the inner offering at throat level and focus on the Three Jewels. Visualizing them as in the Lamrim merit field, we make offerings to all the other lineage Gurus of Sutra and Tantra, to the Buddhas, to the Yidams of the four classes of Tantra, and to the Bodhisattvas. Many offering goddesses mani-fest from our heart and scoop up the nectar as an offering to the Three Jewels. We recite the appropriate VE!rse from the sadhana and then, while reciting OM AH HUM, flick the nectar once. We imagine that the Three Jewels accept with delight and the offering goddesses reabsorb. Then we hold the inner offering at heart level and recite the verse to the local guardians. We visualize all the local guardians, regional guardians, and directional guardians throughout the universe, concentrating especially on those who protect our 93"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND own country and the area in which we live, or where we are doing retreat. We also visualize all peaceful and wrathful spirits and nagas, those who help, those who harm, and those who are neutral. Again we emanate offering goddesses who scoop up the nectar and offer it to the guardians. While reciting OM AH HUM we flick the nectar. The guardians accept the offering and the offering goddesses reabsorb. Lastly we hold the inner offering at navel level and recite the verse to all the sentient beings in the six realms and in the intermediate state. Again we emanate offering goddesses who give nectar to all these beings. We recite OM AH HUM and flick the nectar once. We imagine that all the guests are completely satisfied and enjoy uncontaminated bliss. All sentient beings receive whatever they wish for - food, drink, beautiful things -and their mental and physical faults are purified. Their environment is purified and transforms into outer Dakini Land, their bodies transform into the form of Vajrayogini, and their minds transform into the supreme inner Dakini Land, the clear light Dharmakaya. After making the offering we reabsorb the offering goddesses and contemplate that the guests, the offering, and we ourselves are empty of inherent existence and have the nature of the union of bliss and emptiness. There are other ways of mentally giving our body. For example, in Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Shantideva teaches a method of giving our body in which we imagine that it trans-forms into a wish-granting jewel that radiates light throughout the universe, fulfilling the wishes of all sentient beings and causing them to experience great happiness and satisfaction. Mandala offerings In general 'mandala' means 'universe', but a literal translation of the Tibetan equivalent, 'kyil khor', is 'taking the essence'. By making mandala offerings we create the cause to experience outer and inner Dakini Land, and so we are taking the essence of this precious human life. In the Guhyasamaja Tantra Vajradhara says: 94"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU Those who wish for attainments Should mentally and skilfully fill this universe With the seven precious objects. By offering them every day, Their wishes will be fulfilled. This reveals the offering of the mandala. Although it explicitly mentions only seven points, implicitly it refers to the full thirty-seven-point mandala. It is important for practitioners to obtain a traditional mandala set which consists of a base, three rings, and a top jewel. The rings and base are used to support heaps of rice, or some other grain, which represent the various features of the mandala. Such simple things may seem useless to those who do not know their significance, but they can be very valuabl•~ in the hands of a practitioner who knows how to use them to accumulate a vast collection of merit. To construct the thirty-seven-point mandala we first take a little rice in our left hand and hold the mandala base with that hand. With the right hand we scoop up more ric:e and sprinkle a little onto the surface of the base. With the inside of the right wrist we rub the base clockwise three times. This symbolizes purification of the universal gt:ound. As a result, all rocky and uneven grounds become smooth and level and all our delusions are purified. Then we rub the base three times counter-clock-wise and imagine that all the blessings of the body, speech, and mind of all the Buddhas gather into us. We think that the whole ground has been blessed and recite the mantra for bless-ing the ground: OM VAJRA BHUMI AH HUM. WE! then sprinkle the rice that r-emains in the right hand onto the base and visual-ize that the whole universe transforms into a, pure golden ground. Then, while reciting OM V AJRA REKHE AH HUM, we place the largest ring on the base and, in a clockwise direction, pour a ring of rice inside it to represent the precious iron fence. We then place one heap of grain in the centre of the ring to symbol-ize Mount Meru, visualizing it as a huge mountain made of precious jewels. Next we take another handful of grain and place it in a heap in the east, the part of the mandala base 95"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND nearest to us. This represents the eastern continent. Proceeding clockwise around the ring, we place heaps of grain in the three remaining cardinal directions to symbolize the southern, west-ern, and northern continents. Now we make eight small heaps to represent the eight sub-continents. Beginning with the eastern continent and proceed-ing in a clockwise direction, we place one heap a little to the left and one a little to the right of each continent. Then we make four small piles of grain inside the eastern, southern, western, and northern continents to symbolize respectively the mountain of jewels, the wish-granting tree, the wish-granting cow, and the unsown harvest. We imagine that there are countless continents and sub-continents, each possessing their own special wealth of resources and riches. Now we place the second ring on top of the grains and pour a heap of grain in the east, south, west, and north to represent respectively the precious wheel, the precious jewet the pre-cious queen, and the precious minister. We then place a heap of grain in each of the intermediate directions, south-east, south-west, north-west, and north-east, to represent respect-ively the precious elephant, the precious supreme horse, the precious generat and the great treasure vase. We imagine countless numbers of each of these filling all of space. Again we take grain and place heaps clockwise, first in the four cardinal directions to represent the goddess of beauty (east), the goddess of garlands (south), the goddess of music (west), and the god-dess of dance (north), and then in the four intermediate direc-tions to represent the goddess of flowers (south-east), the god-dess of incense (south-west), the goddess of light (north-west), and the goddess of scent (north-east). We imagine that there are countless offering gods and goddesses filling space. We then place the third ring on top of the grains and make a heap of grain in the east for the sun, one in the west for the moon, one in the south for the precious umbrella, and one in the north for the banner of victory. We imagine that all of space is filled with innumerable precious objects. As we place the top jeweC which is the last thing to be placed on the mandala, we imagine an abundance of other precious jewels and resources enjoyed by both humans and gods. In the 96"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU space above Mount Meru there are the environments of the desire realm gods, and above these there are the form realms. These god realms transform into Pure Lands and the enjoy-ments of the gods become pure enjoyments. Having constructed the mandala, we take a little rice in the right hand and hold the base with both hands. We imagine that all the innumerable world systems and everything contained within them have completely transformed into Pure Lands and pure enjoyments. We imagine that all these are present on the base in our hands, and yet the base does not increase in size and the universe does not become smaller. Just as a mirror can reflect huge mountains, or a small television screen can show images of entire cities, so we imagine that we hold the whole universe in our hands. We concentrate single-pointedly on these countless worlds, resources, and inhabitants, and, with firm faith, offer them all to our Gurus and the Buddhas. While we construct this mandala we should recite the offering prayer from the sadhana. When we have recited the long man-dala offering prayer we can continue, while still holding the base, to offer the twenty-three-point mandala. We do not need to construct a new mandala because the twenty-three precious objects are included among the precious objects of the thirty-seven-point mandala. The twenty-three precious objects are: Mount Meru, the four continents, the eight sub-continents, the seven precious objects (from the precious wheel up to the precious general), the treasure vase, the sun, and the moon. To offer the twenty-three point mandala we recite from the sadhana: 0 Treasure of Compassion, my refuge and I'rotector, I offer you the mountain, continents, precious objects, treasure vase, sun, and moon, Which have arisen from my aggregates, sources, and elements As aspects of the exalted wisdom of spontaneous bliss and emptiness. With this verse we make outer, inner, secret, and suchness mandala offerings. The outer mandala is offered by visualizing the mountain, continents, precious objects, treasure vase, sun, 97"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND and moon. The inner mandala is offered by mentally transform-ing our aggregates and elements into the form of the outer mandala. The secret and suchness mandalas are offered by imagining that our mind of indivisible bliss and emptiness trans-forms into the mandala. From the point of view of it having the nature of great bliss it is the secret mandala, and from the point of view of it being a manifestation of emptiness it is the such-ness mandala. If we wish to collect twenty-three-point mandalas as one of the great preliminary guides we can construct them using the base, with or without the rings, and recite this verse. Offering the mandala is the best method to free ourselves from. future poverty and to create the cause for rebirth in a Buddh!i's Pure Land, By making mandala offerings we lessen our attachment to worldly enjoyments and possessions and we accumulate a vast collection of merit. As a result we will experience a gradual increase of our enjoyments, wealth, and good conditions. Our temporary wishes will be fulfilled and finally we wili attain our ultimate goal, full enlightenment. If we wish to experience these benefits we should familiarize our-selves with the practice of offering the mandala. Je Tsongkhapa was an enlightened being who did not need to accumulate merit, but to show a good example to other practitioners he offered a million mandalas during one of his long retreats in the south of central Tibet, in the cave called Olga Cholung. For a base he used a flat stone and, through offering so many mandalas, he rubbed the inside of his wrist until it was raw and bleeding. Many practitioners have received visions of holy beings as a result of offering mandalas. Khadrubje, a disciple of Je Tsong-khapa, would take his mandala base with him wherever he went because mandala offerings were so important to him. After Je Tsongkhapa had passed away Khadrubje received many visions of him while he was making mandala offerings. The bhikshuni Palma also emphasized the practice of mandala offerings and she received a direct vision of Avalokiteshvara as a result. Whenever Atisha offered a mandala to Tara he would immediately receive a vision of her, and when Chandragomin offered mandalas he received visions of Avalokiteshvara. These examples indicate the power and importance of this practice. 98"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU If we are strongly attached to someone or something we can imagine the object of our attachment on the mandala base, transform it into a pure object_ and then offer it while praying, 'May I be free from all attachment'. In a similar way we can offer all the objects of our ignorance, anger, jealousy, pride, and so forth. While reciting the verse from the sadhana we can offer all objects of our delusions and pray to be free from those delusions. To make mandala offerings as one of the great preliminary guides, we collect one hundred thousand mandala offerings. At the beginning of each session we offer a thirty-seven-point mandala, and then we count seven-point mandalas. To con-struct and count seven-point mandala offerings, we place a loosely threaded mala over the fingers of the left hand, take some rice in it, and then hold the mandala base with that hand. Then we take some rice in the right hand and recite refuge and bodhichitta prayers while constructing the mandala. To do this, we sprinkle a little rice on the base and, with the inside of the right wrist, rub three times clockwise and three times counter-clockwise. We then place a heap of rice at the centre of the base, one in the east, one in the south, one in the west, and one in the north. These represent Mount Meru and the four continents. Then we place a heap of grain in the east for the sun, and one in the west for the moon.

IDAM GURU RATNA MANDALAKAM NIRYATAYAMI After reciting the prayer we tip the grains towards us into a cloth on our lap. This is counted as one mandala offering and so we move one bead along the mala. We make as many mandala offerings as we wish during each session. At the end of the 99"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND session we make a long mandala offering of thirty-seven points and then dedicate the merits. Requesting the lineage Gurus This request is made using the prayer from the long sadhana. As we recite the prayer we should focus our mind on the Gurus mentioned in each verse, generate strong faith in them, and request their blessings. Our principal request is for the realiza-tion of spontaneously-born exalted wisdom, which is the essence of Highest Yoga Tantra. This wisdom is attained when the very subtle mind of spontaneous great bliss realizes empti-ness. It is only by attaining the spontaneously-born exalted wisdom that Buddhahood can be achieved in a single human life, and it is because of this wisdom that Highest Yoga Tantra is the quick path to enlightenment. This wisdom is the real ultimate bodhichitta. When we train in methods to develop spontaneously-born exalted wisdom we are practising the fourth offering of the Tantric seven limbs explained earlier. In Song of the Spring Queen, Je Tsongkhapa says: You who have the characteristic of the liberation of great bliss, Do not say that deliverance can be gained in one lifetime Through various ascetic practices having abandoned great bliss, But that great bliss resides in the centre of the supreme lotus. This clearly indicates that spontaneously-born exalted wisdom is the heart of Tantric practice. Other accomplished Yogis such as the Mahasiddhas Saraha, Nagarjuna, Naropa, and Tilopa have also highly praised the realization of spontaneously-born exalted wisdom and emphasized the importance of the practices that lead to its attainment. At this point in the sadhana we request each lineage Guru to bless our mind to help us to attain this essential realization. Merely gaining an intellectual understanding of the real nature, function, quality, and characteristics of spontaneously-100"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF THE GURU born exalted wisdom will give us great encouragement to study and practise the methods to develop it. If we listen to teachings on this wisdom our mind will become happier and more peace-ful, our ignorance will diminish, and our desire to practise Highest Yoga Tantra will increase. It is important to distinguish between ordinary bliss, the pure bliss mentioned in the Sutras and the lower Tantras, and the spontaneous bliss described in Highest Yoga.Tantra. We should also understand the difference between the bliss achieved through generation stage practice and the spontaneous bliss achieved through completion stage practice. By studying auth-entic commentaries on completion stage practice we will come to understand what spontaneous bliss is, and thereby under-stand the real nature and function of ultimate bodhichitta. More detailed explanations on these essential points can be found in Clear Light of Bliss. In Clear Light of Bliss fou:r distinct experiences of great bliss are explained. The foremost of these is spontaneous great bliss. It is only through attaining a mind of spontaneous great bliss realizing emptiness that we can achieve Buddhahood. Through completion stage meditation we can cause the subtle winds to dissolve into the indestructible drop inside the central channel at the heart. Then, when the bodhichittas melt within the cen-tral channel, we experience great bliss. Several levels of bliss are generated in this way, but the most sublime is spontaneous great bliss. When spontaneous great bliss realizes emptiness, either directly or conceptually, this wisdom is called 'spontan-eously-born exalted wisdom'. We should try to understand the importance of this wisdom and how it is attained. The main purpose of Tantric practice is to develop this wisdom. Wh.en we generate an intense wish to attain this special rE!alization we request our Gurus to grant their blessings to help us to do so. We should firmly believe that the living Gurus are sitting in front of us and cultivate strong faith in them. As we recite the words of request we concentrate on their meaning and imagine that the Gurus listen attentively. After reciting the last verse, to Losang Yeshe Trijang Dorjechang, we focus our mind on our root Guru on the central throne and recite the following two verses: 101"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND My kind root Guru, Vajradharma, You are the embodiment of all the Conquerors Who grant the blessings of all Buddhas' speech, I request you, please bestow the spontaneously-born exalted wisdom. Please bless me so that through the force of meditation On the Dakini yoga of the profound generation stage, And the central channel yoga of the, completion stage, I may generate the exalted wisdom of spontaneous great bliss and attain the enlightened Dakini state. We should not be satisfied with merely reciting these requests. We should make a strong determination actually to engage in the practices of generation stage and completion stage. This is because the attainment of the enlightened Dakini state, Buddhahood, depends upon spontaneously-born exalted wisdom, which depends upon the central channel yoga of com-pletion stage, which in turn depends on the self-generation practices of generation stage. Having understood the purpose of the two Tantric stages, we should conclude our request by making a strong determination to practise them. Receiving the blessings of the four empowerments The first of the four empowerments is the vase empowerment, through which we receive the blessings of all Buddhas' bodies. This empowerment purifies the negative karma we have created with our body and sows the seed for us to attain generation stage realizations and the Emanation Body of a Buddha. Through the second empowerment, the secret empowerment, we receive the blessings of all Buddhas' speech. The secret empowerment purifies our negative karma of speech and is a cause to attain the illusory body of completion stage and the Complete Enjoyment Body of a Buddha. Through the third empowerment, the wisdom-mudra empowerment, we receive the blessings of all Buddhas' mind.

We take the four empowerments to obtain these blessings and realizations. We receive the four empowerments directly from our Guru during the actual Highest Yoga Tantra empowemtent. The pur-pose of receiving the blessings of the four empowerments when we practise the sadhana is to prevent the blessings we received directly from our Guru from degenerating. First we request our root Guru to grant the four empower-ments by reciting the following prayer three times: I request you 0 Guru incorporating all objects of refuge, Please grant me your blessings, Please grant me the four empowerments completely, And bestow on me, please, the state of the four bodies. Then we visualize that, from the OM at our Guru's forehead, rays of white light and nectar radiate. Each tiny particle of the light and nectar appears in the form of a radiant white letter OM, which is the essence of the bodies of all the Buddhas. The light and nectar dissolve into our forehead, purifying the negativities and obstructions of our body. We receive the vase empowerment and the blessings of our Guru's body enter our body. These cause the seeds of the generation stage realizations and the Emanation Body to ripen. From the letter AH at our Guru's throat, rays of red light and nectar radiate.

Alternatively we can recite the same number of either the name mantra of our Guru or the mantra of Guru Vajradharma: OM AH GURU VAJRADHARMA SARWA SIDDHI HUM HUM.

Out of his affection for us, our root Guru develops a wish to unite with us, and we from our side also wish strongly for this to happen.

These three bodies are called the 'three resultant bodies' or the 'three results of purification'. The basic truth body is our clear light of sleep and our clear light of death. At the moment, neither of these minds is an actual Truth Body, but they are the bases of the actual Truth Body because they are similar in aspect to th<e Truth Body and they are the bases that are brought into the path and trans-formed into the actual Truth Body of a Buddha. The basic enjoyment body is our dream body and our intermediate state, or bardo, body. They are the bases of the Enjoyment body because they are similar in aspect to the Enjoyment Body. By bringing the dream body and the intermediate state body into the path we can eventually transform them into the actual Enjoyment Body of a Buddha. The basic emanation body is waking from sleep and rebirth. They are the bases of the actual Emanation Body because they are similar in aspect to the way in which an Emanation Body develops, and because by bringing waking and rebirth into the path we will eventually achieve the actual Emanation Body of a Buddha. The three resultant bodies of a Buddha, the actual Truth Body, the actual Enjoyment Body, and the actual Emanation Body, are achieved through the generation and completion stage practices of Highest Yoga Tantra. First we must attain the three bodies of the path: ultimate example dear light, which directly prevents ordinary death; the illusory body, which directly prevents ordinary intermediate state; and the gross Deity body that arises from the illusory body, which directly prevents ordinary rebirth. These three bodies of the path are achieved through completion stage practice. To achieve the three bodies of the path we need to train in bringing the basic truth body into the path that prevents ordin-ary death, bringing the basic enjoyment body into the path that prevents ordinary intermediate state, and bringing the basic emanation body into the path that prevents ordinary rebirth. We can meditate on bringing the three bas:ic bodies into the path according to generation stage or according to completion stage. Before we achieve actual completion stage realizations we need constantly to improve our meditation on bringing the 107"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND three basic bodies into the path according to generation stage. Once we have gained experience in this, and have also achieved some experience of completion stage, we should emphasize the meditations on bringing the three basic bodies into the path according to c;:ompletion stage. Finally we will achieve the actual three bodies of the path. To summarize, the bases that need to be purified are death, intermediate state, and samsaric rebirth; the methods to purify these are the three bodies of the path and the practices of bringing the three basic bodies into the path; and the results of purification are the three bodies of a Buddha. Since beginningless time, we have experienced an uninter-rupted cycle of death, intermediate state, and rebirth. For as long as we remain in this cyclic state we shall be imprisoned within samsara and we shall continue to experience misery without choice. Until we purify death, ·intermediate state, and rebirth, we will not achieve Buddhahood. The principal function of the generation and completion stages is to purify these three states and thereby to attain the three resultant bodies. This is done by engaging in the meditations on bringing the three basic bodies into the path. The practice of bringing the three bodies into the path This has three parts: 1 Bringing death into the path of the Truth Body 2 Bringing the intermediate state into the path of the Enjoyment Body 3 Bringing rebirth into the path of the Emanation Body BRINGING DEATH INTO THE PATH OF THE TRUTH BODY This practice has three main functions: it purifies ordinary death, it causes the realization of clear light to ripen, and it increases our accumulation of wisdom. In this meditation, we cultivate experiences similar to those we experience when we die by imagining that we perceive the signs that occur during the death process, from the mirage-like appearance to the appearance of clear light. 108"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS Having requested our Guru to bless our mind and imagined that he has entered our heart, we develop three recognitions: that the nature of our Guru's mind is the union of great bliss and emptiness, that our Guru's mind has mixed inseparably with our own mind, transforming it into the union of great bliss and emptiness, and that our mind of great bliss is in the aspect of a red letter BAM at our heart. We meditate on this for a while. Then the letter BAM begins to increase in size, gradually melting our body into blissful red light, just as warm water melts ice when it is poured onto it. The BAM expands until it has absorbed our whole body. Continuing to expand, the letter BAM gradually absorbs our room, our house, our town, our country, our continent, our world, and finally the whole uni-verse, including all the sentient beings who inhabit it. Every-thing is absorbed and transformed into an infinitely large letter BAM that pervades the whole of space. This BAM is the nature of our mind of great bliss and emptiness. We perceive nothing but this letter BAM and we meditate on this single-pointedly for a while. We think, 'I have purified all sentient beings together with their environments'. After a while the letter BAM begins to contract, gradually gathering inwards from the edges of infinite space and leaving behind only emptiness. It becomes smaller and smaller until there remains only a minute letter BAM. Then this tiny letter BAM gradually dissolves from the bottom up to the horizontal line at the head of the BAM. During this process we imagine that we undergo experiences similar to those experienced by a dying person. At this point we perceive the mirage-like appear-ance that arises due to the dissolution of the earth element. The head of the BAM then dissolves into the crescent moon and we perceive the smoke-like appearance that arises due to the dissolution of the water element. The crescent moon then dis-solves into the drop and we perceive the sparkling-fireflies-like appearance that arises due to the dissolution of the fire element. Then the drop dissolves into the nada and we perceive the candle-flame-like appearance that arises due to the dissolution of the wind element. These four appearances are the inner signs that our four 109"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND bodily elements have dissolved. When we die, the four elements that make up our body gradually absorb one into another and, because of this, we experience these four signs. Normally when the fourth sign of the death process; the candle-flame-like appearance, is perceived, all gross memory, gross inner winds, and gross appearances cease and the external breathing stops. At this point in the meditation all that remains is the nada. After a while we imagine that we experience the fifth sign, the mind of white appearance. With each succeeding dissolution the mind becomes increasingly subtle. When the lower curve of the nada dissolves upwards into the middle curve we experi-ence the mind of red increase, and when the middle curve dissolves into the upper curve we experience the mind of black-near-attainment. Finally the upper curve dissolves into empti-ness and we experience the most subtle mind, the mind of clear light. At this point we should have four recognitions: (1) we imagine that our mind of clear light has actually manifested and that it is experiencing great bliss, (2) only emptiness appears to our mind, (3) this emptiness is ascertained as emptiness of inherent existence, (4) we imagine that we have achieved the Truth Body of a Buddha and think, 'I am the Truth Body'. We then meditate on the mind of clear light whilst trying to main-tain constantly these four recognitions. Without being distracted from the main meditation, from time h;> time we should use one part of our mind to check that none of these recognitions is missing. If we find that we have lost one or more of them we should apply skilful effort to re-estab-lish them. If we meditate in this way every day, even with weak concentration, we will gather an accumulation of wisdom. An accumulation of wisdom is defined as any virtuous mental action that principally causes the attainment of a Buddha's Truth Body. An accumulation of merit is defined as any virtuous action that principally causes the attainment of a Buddha's Form Body. By completing these two accumulations we will achieve Buddhahood. For the beginner there is a simplified meditation on bringing death into the path. When we have dissolved the nada into 110"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS emptiness we imagine that we perceive the eighth sign, the clear light, and we imagine that this mind is experiencing great bliss. Then, with this mind of bliss, we meditate on emptiness. Without losing this experience of the blissful mind of clear light meditating on emptiness, with one part of our mind we imagine that our mind of bliss has completely mixed with emptiness like water mixing with water, and we identify this union of bliss and emptiness as the Truth Body. We then meditate on this single-pointedly. When, through completion stage meditation, we are able to cause our inner winds to enter and dissolve within the central channel at the heart channel wheel, we experience the isolated mind of example clear light. Once we have achieved this realiza-tion, our death will no longer be an uncontroll·ed, samsaric process. We will be able to control the process of dying by transforming the clear light of death into the mind of ultimate example clear light. This is the quick path to Buddhahood. When we arise from this clear light, instead of entering the ordinary intermediate state with an intermediate state body, we attain the illusory body. From this subtle illusory body, instead of having to take an ordinary rebirth, we emanate a gross Deity body similar to the Emanation Body of a Buddha. In summary, from the moment we attain ultimate example clear light we will be able to control death, intermediate state, and rebirth. The attainment of ultimate example clear light depends upon training in meditation on bringing d•eath into the path of the Truth Body. To meditate on bringing death into the path of the Truth Body we must first prevent all ordinary appearances by perceiving everything as empty. This emptiness should be identified as emptiness of inherent existence, and we should imagine that our mind merges with this emptiness. Then, with a feeling that our mind is completely one with emptiness, we try to develop the divine pride of being the Truth Body. ff we are successful in this meditation our meditations on generating ourselves as a Deity will also be successful. Once a practitioner told Longdol Lama that, even though he tried hard to generate himself as a Deity, he was still conscious of his ordinary body, his friends, his house, and all the things he usually did. He asked what he should do to correct this. 111"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Longdol Lama replied that he could solve the problem by train-ing in the meditation on bringing death into the path of the Truth Body. By imagining that everything dissolves into empti-ness, ordinary appearances will be overcome and this will make it easy to generate new, pure appearances. BRINGING THE INTERMEDIATE STATE INTO THE PATH OF THE ENJOYMENT BODY Immediately after an experience of clear light has ceased and the mind has become slightly grosser, a subtle body manifests. For an ordinary being, a dream body arises when the clear light of sleep ceases, and a bardo body arises when the clear light of death ceases. For a Tantric practitioner, the impure illusory body arises from the mind of ultimate example clear light, and the pure illusory body arises from the mind of meaning clear light. For a Buddha, the Enjoyment Body arises from the clear light of the Truth Body. When we meditate on bringing death into the path of the Truth Body, we develop divine pride thinking, 'I am the Dharmakaya'. While maintaining this divine pride, one part of our mind should think, 'If I remain only as the Truth Body I cannot benefit sentient beings because they are unable to see this Body. I must therefore arise in a Form Body, a Buddha's Enjoyment Body'. With this thought we imagine that, from the clear light of emptiness, our mind instantly transforms into an Enjoyment Body in the aspect of the red letter BAM. We generate divine pride thinking, 'I am the Enjoyment Body' and meditate briefly on this feeling of being the Enjoyment Body. At this stage it is more important to meditate on the feeling of being the Enjoy-ment Body of a Buddha than it is to dwell on the thought that we are in the aspect of a red letter BAM. The nature of our mind is great bliss and its aspect is a red letter BAM. The letter BAM has three parts: the BA, the drop, and the nada. These symbolize the body, speech, and mind of the bardo being and the body, speech, and mind of the Enjoy-ment Body. This demonstrates that meditation on bringing the intermediate state into the path purifies the intermediate state 112"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS and causes the ripening of the illusory body, which eventually transforms into the Enjoyment Body of a Buddha. BRINGING REBIRTH INTO THE PATH OF THE EMANATION BODY For ordinary beings, the waking state arises from the dream body, and after death their next rebirth arises from the bardo body. Similarly, for Tantric practitioners, the gross Deity body arises from the illusory body and, for Buddhas, the Emanation Body arises from the Enjoyment Body. When we meditate on bringing rebirth into the path of the Emanation Body, we imagine a similar process. While we are in the form of the red letter BAM standing in space, which we identify as being the Enjoyment Body, another part of our mind thinks, 'If I remain only in this form I will not be able to benefit ordinary beings because they are unable to see a Buddha's Enjoyment Body. Therefore, I must be born in an Emanation Body so that even ordinary beings can see me'. With this motivation we decide to look for a place in which to take rebirth. Looking down through the space beneath us we see two red EH letters appearing from the state of emptiness, one above the other. These transform into a phenomena-source, which is shaped like a double tetrahedron and stands with its fine tip pointing downwards and its broad neck facing upwards. There is an outer tetrahedron, which is white, and an inner one, which is red. They are both made of light and so they interpen-etrate without obstruction. Looked at from above, the top of the double tetrahedron resembles a six-pointed star, with one point of the inner tetrahedron pointing towards the front and one point of the outer tetrahedron pointing towards the back. The triangular segments at the front and the back are empty, but in each of the four remaining segments there is a pink joy swirl spinning counter-clockwise. Inside the phenomena-source there appears .a white letter AH which transforms into a white moon cushion. Standing around the edge of the moon cushion there are the letters of the three-OM mantra: OM OM OM SARWA BUDDHA DAKINIYE V AJRA WARNANIYE VAJRA BEROTZANIYE HUM HUM HUM PHAT PHAT 113"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND PHAT SOHA. The letters are red and they are arrayed counter-clockwise, starting from the front. The centre of the moon cushion is empty. Our mind, the red letter BAM, observes these developments from above. The outer phenomena-source represents the rebirth environ-ment and the inner phenomena-source symbolizes the mother's womb. The white moon cushion symbolizes the white bodhi-chitta of Father Heruka and the red mantra garland symbolizes the red bodhichitta of Mother Vajrayogini. Because the mantra garland is reflected in the moon, the moon is tinged with red. The moon and mantra garland together symbolize the union of the germ cells of the father and mother at the moment of conception. Just before a bardo being takes rebirth it sees its future parents having intercourse. Similarly, we, in the aspect of the red BAM, observe below us the union of Father Heruka and Mother Vajrayogini in the symbolic forms of the moon and mantra garland, and we generate a strong motivation to take rebirth there. With this motivation we, the letter BAM, descend and alight upon the centre of the moon inside the phenomena-source. This is similar to a bardo being taking rebirth in the womb of its future mother. From the letter BAM and the mantra garland, rays of light radiate throughout space. On the tip of each ray there is a Deity of Heruka's mandala. These Heroes and Heroines bestow blessings and empowerments upon all beings throughout the universe. They purify all samsaric beings and those who have entered solitary nirvana, together with their environments, and transform them into pure beings in Vajrayogini's Pure Land. Then the transformed beings, their worlds, the phenomena-source, and the moon cushion all melt into light and dissolve into our mind, the letter BAM. This and the mantra garland then instantly transform into the supporting mandala and the supported Deities of Vajrayogini. We become Vajrayogini with a pure body; speech, and mind, abiding in the Pure Land of Vajrayogini and experiencing pure enjoyments. We think, 'Now I am born in Pure Dakini Land as Buddha Vajrayogini' s Emanation Body'. We hold this recognition firmly and meditate on it for a while. 114"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS Checking meditation on the mandala and the beings within it With the divine pride of being the Emanation Body of Buddha Vajrayogini, and viewing our environment as Pure Dakini Land, we now improve our clear appearance of the mandala and the beings within it by contemplating the following: The mandala is supported by a vast and extensive vafra ground, which is composed entirely of indestructible vajras. Each vajra consists of vajra-shaped atoms. Enclosing the entire vajra ground is the circular vajra fence. The vajra fence has three layers of huge five-pronged vajras. The first layer lies horizontally. Upon this, the second layer stands vertically, and on top of this the third layer lies horizontally. The vajra fence is impenetrable and indestructible, with not even the smallest gap. On top of the vajra fence there is the vajra canopy, which serves as a ceiling. Above this there is the cone-shaped vajra tent. The impenetrable canopy and tent, which have the shape of'a MongoliCJn tent, are also composed of vajras. Each vajra is composed of tiny atom-like vajras, which allow no intervening space. Although all the tiny vajra-atoms are clear and distinct, not one single atom can be removed. The vajra ground, fence, canopy, and tent are blue in colour and are entirely surrounded by five-coloured flames of wisdom-fire which swirl counter-clockwise. The flames are real and have the power to protect us from all harm from evil spirits. By repeatedly contemplating the details of the protection circle, the clarity of our visualization will gradually improve and we will develop firm conviction that the protection circle actu-ally exists and is effective in protecting us from harm and hind-rance. We continue our checking meditation: Just inside the protection circle, situated in the cardinal and intermediate directions, there are the eight great charnel grounds. The eastern charnel ground is called Ferocious One, the northern ground, Very Dense Forest, the western ground, Blazing Vajra, and the southern ground, Possessing Bone and Marrow. In the south-east the charnel ground is called Auspicious Guardian, in 115"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND the south-west, Fearful Darkness, in the north-west, Making the Sound Kili Kili, and in the north-east, Wrathful Laughter. Each charnel ground has eight features: a tree, a directional guardian, a regional guardian, a lake, a naga, a cloud, a fire, and a stupa. In the eastern charnel ground the tree is called Naga Tree. At its foot is ,the guardian of the east called Indra. He is yellow, holds a vajra and skullcup, and rides a white elephant. At the top of the tree there is a white regional guardian called Elephant Face. Below there is a lake called Water of Compassion in which there is a white naga called Increasing Wealth. In the sky above there is a cloud called Making Sounds. A fire called Wisdom Fire blazes at the base of a precious mountain called Mount Meru.

A fire of wisdom blazes at the base of a white mountain called Kailash. At the crest of the mountain there is a white stupa. In the southern charnel ground the tree is called Tsuta. At its foot is the guardian of the south called Yama. He is blue, holds a staff and skullcup, and rides on a buffalo. At the top of the tree there is a black regional guardian called Buffalo Face. In the lake below there is a white naga called Lotus, and in the sky above there is a cloud called Moving. A fire of wisdom blazes at the base of a yellow mountain called Malaya. At the crest of the mountain there is a white stupa. 116"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS In the south-eastern charnel ground the tree is called Karanza.

In the lake below there is a white naga called Great Lotus, and in the sky above there is a cloud called Unmoving. Afire of wisdom blazes at the base of a black mountain called Great Power. At the crest of the mountain there is a white stupa. In each of the. eight charnel grounds the regional guardian holds a red triangular-shaped torma and a skullcup, and sits in the top of the tree with the upper half of his body emerging above 117"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND the branches. The lake, fire, and stupa in each of the charnel grounds have the same names as those in the eastern charnel ground. In addition to these eight features, in each charnel ground there are various creatures such as crows, owls, eagles, foxes, snakes, and bull-headed snakes, as well as other manifesta-tions such as spirits, zombies, and flesh-eating spirits. There are also many different Tantric meditators in the aspect of humans and gods, and many Yogis and Yoginis manifesting in various forms. Everything inside the charnel grounds, including the lakes, clouds, and animals, is an emanation of Vajrayogini. In general, the eight directional guardians and the eight regional guardians are worldly deities who control the eight directions of this world and all the major regions within it. In the Mahakala sadhana it says that each directional guardian has a retinue of a hundred thousand, and this is true also of the regional guardians. The directional guardians are like officers of the whole country and the regional guardians are like district officers who control regions within the country. In addition, every city, town, and small village has a local guardian spirit who controls that area. Usually they try to help the humans living there, but sometimes, due to discontent or anger, they cause problems such as hail storms or hurricanes. The directional guardians and regional guardians in the char-nel grot..nds ofVajrayogini's mandala, however, are not worldly deities but emanations of Vajrayogini. In the preliminary torma offering prayer in the self-initiation sadhana, eleven different assemblies of guardians are mentioned, such as the gods, nagas, givers of harm, and so forth. The directional guardians and regional guardians in the charnel grounds appear in these eleven different aspects. Some appear as gods, some as nagas, and so forth. When we offer tormas to the mundane dakas and dakinis we invite these eleven groups from the eight charnel grounds to. receive the torma. Continuing our checking mediation on the mandala we now contemplate: In the centre of the circle of eight charnel grounds there is the celestial mansion, a red phenomena-source standing on its tip on the vajra ground. Within each of its four side corners there is a 118"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS pink joy swirl spinning counter-clockwise. Inside the phenomena-source there is an eight-petalled lotus of various colours. The lotus petals in the cardinal directions are red. The colours of the petals in the intermediate directions are: in the south-east, yellow, in the south-west, green, in the north-west, yellow, and irt the north-east, black. The centre of the lotus is green and is encircled by yellow anthers. In the centre of the lotus there is a sun mandala. Upon this I arise in the form of Venerable Vajrayogini. My outstretched right leg treads on the breast of red Kalarati. She has one face and lies on her back with her two hands pressed together. My bent left leg treads on the forehead of black Bhai-rawa. He has one face and lies on his front with his head bent backwards, touching his back, and his two hands pressed together. I have a red-coloured body which shines wif\"h a brilliance like that of the fire at the end of an aeon. I have one face, two hands, and three eyes looking up towards the Pure Land of the Dakinis. My right hand, outstretched and pointing downwards, holds a curved knife marked with a vajra. My lejt holds up a skullcup filled with blood which I partake of with my upturned mouth. My left shoulder supports a khatanga marked with a vajra from which hang a damaru, bell, and triple banner. My black hair, hanging straight, covers my back down to my waist. I am in the prime of my youth. My aroused breasts are full and I show the manner of generating bliss. My head is adorned with five human skulls and I wear a long necklace of fifty human skulls. Naked, I am adorned with five mudras and stand in the centre of a blazing fire of exalted wisdom. The protection circle, charnel grounds, and phenomena-source are extremely vast and in the nature of uncontaminated wisdom. This is the Pure Land of the Dakinis. I have now been born here in the aspect of Vajrayogini. In order to overcome ordinary appearances we should repeat-edly contemplate the symbolism of the protection circle, the charnel grounds, the mandala, and all the beings within them. The five-coloured fire of the protection circle is a manifestation of the five omniscient wisdoms of Vajrayogini and symbolizes ultimate bodhichitta. The vajra fence and tent symbolize con-ventional bodhichitta, and the charnel grounds symbolize 119"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND renunciation. Together these three teach us that first we should gain experience of the three principal aspects of the path. The red, inner phenomena-source symbolizes great bliss and the white, outer phenomena-source symbolizes emptiness. Together they teach us that we should develop the union of great bliss and emptiness. The phenomena-source gradually increases in width from the bottom upwards, showing that high Tantric realizations cannot be attained inst..mtly but develop gradually. By constantly improving our small Dharma experience we will eventually achieve the supreme attainment of Buddhahood. The three points of the top of each tetrahedron represent the three doors of liberation: the emptiness of the nature of all phenomena, the emptiness of causes, and the emptiness of effects. These teach us that the nature of all phenomena, as well as all causes and all effects, are simply manifestations of emptiness. The empty front and back corners symbolize the selflessness of persons and the selflessness of phenomena. The pink joy swirls in the other four corners symbolize the four joys. Together all six corners show that we should combine the practice of emptiness with the practice of the four joys. The sun mandala upon which we stand symbolizes the method for ripening the virtuous crop of generation stage and completion stage realizations, and for attaining the harvest of Vajrayogini's faultless Form Body, her Pure Land, and her pure enjoyments. The lotus symbolizes that Vajrayogini's body, speech, and mind are free from faults and are completely pure. Our right leg treads on the breast of red Kalarati, the principal worldly goddess, and our left leg treads on the forehead of black Bhairawa, or wrathful Ishvara, the principal worldly god. These are not the actual sentient beings, Kalarati and Bhairawa, but manifestations of Vajrayogini' s wisdom of bliss and empti-ness appearing in the aspect of Kalarati and Bhairawa. They symbolize the maras of the delusions. Vajrayogini treads on Kalarati and Bhairawa to demonstrate that she has destroyed her attachment, hatred, and ignorance, and to show that she is free from the fears of samsara and solitary peace and can lead all sentient beings to the same freedom. The brilliance of Vajrayogini's red-coloured body, which 120"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRATORS shines like the fire at the end of an aeon, symbolizes the blazing of her inner fire. Her inner fire causes her body to be pervaded by spontaneous great bliss through which she completely destroys the two obstructions. Her single face indicates that she has realized that ultimately all phenomena are of one taste, or of one nature. Her two arms represent her complete realization of the two truths. Her three eyes reveal her ability to see every-thing in the past, present, and future. She looks up to space, demonstrating her attainment of outer and inner Pure Dakini Land, and indicating that she leads her followers to these attain-ments. Her right hand holds a curved knife to show her power to cut the continuum of the delusions and obstacles of her followers, and of all sentient beings. Her left hand holds a kapala filled with blood, which symbolizes her experience of the clear light of bliss. Vajrayogini's left shoulder supports a khatanga showing that she is never separated from Father Heruka. The khatanga is Heruka himself and the various features of the khatanga are the sixty-two Deities of Heruka' s mandala. The khatanga is octagonal in cross-section, symbolizing the eight great charnel grounds of Heruka's mandala. At its lower tip there is a single-pronged vajra which symbolizes the protection circle of Heruka's mandala. Towards the upper end of the khatanga there is a vase symbolizing Heruka's celestial mansion. Above this there is a crossed vajra symbolizing the eight Deities of the commitment wheel, a blue human head symbolizing the sixteen Deities of the heart wheel, a red human head symbolizing the sixteen Deities of the speech wheel, and a white human head symbolizing the sixteen Deities of the body wheel. At the very top of the khatanga there is a five-pronged vajra symbolizing the five Deities of the great bliss wheel. Vajrayogini' s body is in nature the perfection of wisdom of all the Buddhas. Her five mudra-ornaments of bone are the other five perfections of all the Buddhas. Adorning her crown there is a horizontal eight-spoked wheel made from bone, and at its centre there is a precious red jewel with nine facets. On top of this there is a blue five-pronged vajra. At the front edge of the wheel there is a tiara of five human skulls and on top of each skull there is a jewel. The five jewels symbolize the five 121"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Buddha Families. All these together constitute Vajrayogini's head ornament, which is the perfection of effort of all the Bud-dhas. The other ornaments are: the ear ornaments, the perfec-tion of patience; the neck ornaments, the perfection of giving; the heart ornaments, the perfection of mental stabilization; and the ornaments of the arms and legs, the perfection of moral discipline. Vajrayogini's five purified aggregates appear in the form of the five human skulls. Her fifty purified inner winds, the seeds of speech, appear in the form of a garland of fifty human skulls which she wears hanging from her neck. Her hair is black, symbolizing the unchangeable nature of her Truth Body. It falls freely down her back to show that she is free from the fetters of self-grasping. In the long dedication prayer in the sadhana her hair is said to be orange, but this refers mainly to her human emanations who have appeared with orange hair, as witnessed by Tsarchen Losal Gyatso and others. Vajrayogini is naked ,and her breasts are full and aroused, showing that she herself experiences great bliss and also that she bestows the siddhi of great bliss upon practitioners. By· contemplating this symbolism we should try to prevent ordinary appearance of ourself, our environment, and our enjoyments, and think strongly, 'I am newly-born in my own Pure Dakini Land as the Emanation Body of Vajrayogini'. The actual meditation of generation stage The third part of the yoga of self-generation, actual generation stage meditation, is explained after the next two yogas. THE YOGA OF PURIFYING MIGRATORS Through continual practice of the sixth yoga, the yoga of self-generation, we will improve our familiarity with the recognition that we have achieved Buddhahood in the aspect of Vajrayogini. After having generated ourselves as Vajrayogini abiding in her Pure Land, we should think: 122"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF SELF-GENERATION AND PURIFYING MIGRA TORS I have compassion and love for all beings of the six realms. Now I can lead them all to enlightenment by purifying their environments, enjoyments, bodies, and minds and transforming them into the environments, enjoyments, body, and mind of Vajrayogini. We then recite the appropriate words from the sadhana, while meditating on their meaning as follows: At my heart inside a red phenomena-source, a double tetrahedron, there is a moon mandala. In the centre of this there is a letter BAM encircled by a mantra rosary. Light rays radiate from the moon, letter BAM, and mantra rosary and leave my body through the pores of my skin. These light rays touch all sentient beings of the six realms, cleansing their negativities and obstructions together with their imprints and transforming them all into the form of Vajrayogini. When we generate bodhichitta we have two wishes: to attain Buddhahood ourselves and to lead all living beings to the same state. We imagine that we have already fulfilled our first wish by practising the sixth yoga, the yoga of self-generation. We now fulfil our second wish by practising the seventh yoga, the yoga of purifying migrators. Both practices are the main cause to fulfil these two wishes. 123"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Pamtingpa"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Yoga of being Blessed by Heroes and Heroines This has six parts: 1 Meditation on the body mandala 2 Absorbing the wisdom beings and mixing the three messengers 3 Putting on the armour 4 Granting empowerment and adorning the crown 5 Making offerings to the self-generation 6 The eight lines of praise to the Mother MEDITATION ON THE BODY MANDALA This has two parts: 1 General explanation 2 The actual meditation General explanation A body mandala is so called because the original substance that transforms into a body mandala is part of the body of a self-generation. This is similar to calling a vase a golden vase because the substance of the vase is gold. A body mandala is defined as the transformation of any part of the body of a self-generation into a Deity. Merely visualizing Deities marked on the body, as in the. practice of Yamantaka, is not a body mandala practice. Moreover, when we generate ourselves as Vajrayogini, our body is not a body mandala because its substantial cause is not a part of our body. During the practice of bringing death into the path we mentally dissolve 125"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND our ordinary body into emptiness, and from emptiness we arise in the form of the letter BAM, which is the nature of our own mind. This BAM then transforms into the body of Vajrayogini. Since the substantial cause of the body of the self-generation is our mind, the body of the self-generation cannot be a body mandala. It is only when a part of the body of the self-generation transforms into a Deity that it becomes a body mandala. This is not easy to understand at first and there are different interpretations in various texts as to what is and what is not a body mandala. Recognizing its superiority over the body mandala practices of other Deities, many highly realized Masters have praised the profound body mandala practice of Vajrayogini. It is an especially powerful method to bless our channels, winds, and drops. Through such blessings, our inner winds will gather and dissolve within the central channel at our heart, and this will cause us to experience the clear light of bliss, the actu,al quick path leading to Buddhahood. Je Tsongkhapa said \"that the attainment of spontaneous great bliss depends upon the chan-nels and drops being blessed by Heroes and Heroines. Meditat-ing on the body mandala enables us to receive these blessings. Wnen we visualize our channels and drops in the aspect of Heroines, the Heroines of the Twenty-four Holy Places actually enter into our channels and drops and bless them. This helps us to develop great bliss. The body mandala of Vajrayogini has thirty-seven Deities generated from thirty-seven parts of her body. These thirty-seven parts are the twenty-four channels of the twenty-four inner places, the eight channels of the eight doors of the sense powers, the four channels of the heart channel wheel, and the very subtle indestructible drop at the heart. Shortly after conception, when the body begins to take form, the first channel to develop is the central channel at the level of the heart. From the central channel, the eight channels of the heart branch out, and from these the twenty-four channels develop. The central channel can be likened to the central rod of an umbrella and the twenty-four channels to its spokes. The inner tips of the twenty-four channels join the central channel 126"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES at the heart channel wheel and the outer tips terminate at the twenty-four inner places. The twenty-four inner places of the body are: the hairline of the forehead, the crown of the head, the right ear, the back of the neck, the left ear, the place between the eyebrows, the two eyes, the two shoulders, the two armpits, the two breasts, the navel, the tip of the nose, the mouth, the throat, the heart, that is the area ffiidway between the two breasts, the two testicles for men, or the two sides of the vagina for women, the sex organ, the anus, the two thighs, the two calves, the eight fingers and eight lesser toes, the fronts of the two ankles, the two thumbs and the two big toes, and the two knees. These corre-spond to the twenty-four outer Pure Lands of Heruka and Vajrayogini that exist in this world. In the practice of Heruka' s body mandala, Deities are gener-ated at the outer tips of the twenty-four channels, at the twenty-four inner places. In Vajrayogini's body mandala, however, the Deities are generated at the inner tips of the twenty-four channels, inside the central channel at the heart channel wheel. This is the main reason why Vajrayogini's body mandala is more profound than those of other Yidams. The eight channels are those of the eight doors of the sense powers. These eight doors are tiny openings or vacuoles at the outer tip of each of the eight channels. They are located at: the root of the tongue, the navel, the sex organ, the anus, the point between the eyebrows, the two ears, the two eyes, and the nostrils. The inner tips of these eight channels join the central channel at the heart channel wheel together with the inner tips of the twenty-four channels, the inner tips of the four channels of the heart channel wheel, and the indestructible drop. These thirty-seven parts of the bodytransform into the thirty-seven female Deities of the sixty-two Deities of Heruka' s man-dala. The sixty-two Deities are included within five 'wheels': the six Deities of the great bliss wheel, the sixteen Deities of the heart wheel, the sixteen Deities of the speech wheel, the sixteen Deities of the body wheel, and the eight Deities of the commitment wheel. However, we directly visualize only the eight Heroines of the commitment wheel, the eight Heroines of the body wheel, the eight Heroines of the speech wheel_ the 127"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND eight Heroines of the heart wheel, and the five female Deities of the great bliss wheel (the Goddesses of the four directions and the main Deity of the body mandala, Vajrayogini). The remaining twenty-five Deities, the male Deities, are not visual-ized directly but appear as the khatangas that are held by each of these Heroines. All the Heroines of the body mandala are generated inside the central channel of the heart channel wheel. The central channel is flanked on both sides by the right and left channels. At the heart channel wheel, these two channels loop round the central channel three times, forming six knots in the central channel. At the centre of these knots inside the central channel there is a tiny vacuole. This is where we visualize the body mandala of Vajrayogini. The centre of the heart channel wheel is one of the ten doors through which winds can enter the central channel. It is very important to locate accurately the place of the body mandala meditation. If we practise the body mandala every day, visualizing the Heroines and their khatangas at the inner tips of the twenty-four channels, and regarding these channels as the twenty-four inner places, all the Heroes and Heroines of the Twenty-four outer Places will enter our body. There is no need to go to the Twenty-four outer Places to receive blessings from these Deities. The actual meditation At the centre of the heart channel wheel we visualize a phe-nomena-source in the centre of which there is a tiny moon cushion, smaller than a fingernail or as small as we can visualize it. On top of the moon cushion there are the thirty-six channels and the indestructible drop. Beginning from the front of the moon cushion and going counter-clockwise, there are the twenty-four channels of the twenty-four inner places and the eight channels of the eight doors of the sense powers, making a circle of thirty-two channels. This arrangement is similar to the way in which the thirty-two letters of the three-OM mantra are arranged on the moon cushion during mantra recitation. The channels stand upright. They are slightly thicker than a 128"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES needle and very short. They are transparent and are filled with red and white drops. Inside the circle of the thirty-two channels there are the four channels of the heart channel wheel standing in the cardinal directions. In the centre of. these there is the very subtle indestructible drop, which is about the size of a mustard seed. The top half is white and the bottom half is red, and it is clear and translucent. It is important to believe that these visualized channels and drops are the actual channels and drops of our own body. The thirty-two channels form a circle around the edge of the moon-disc. Inside these there are the four channels of the four directions, and in the very centre of these there is the indestruc-tible drop. The thirty-two channels instantaneously transform into the thirty-two letters of the three-OM mantra, which are standing upright. The four channels, starting from the left, or the north, and going counter-clockwise, transform respectively into the green letter YA, the red letter RA, the yellow letter LA, and the white letter WA. The central drop transforms into the letter short-AH, the top half of which is white and the bottom half of which is red. We try to focus our mind clearly on these thirty-seven letters. These are in essence our thirty-six channels and our indestructible drop, but they have the aspect of the letters of the three-OM mantra. After focusing on these letters for a while w~~ imagine that they transform simultaneously into the Heroines of Heruka' s mandala. In the centre is Vajrayogini. She is surrounded by the four Heroines of the four cardinal directions, and these in turn are surrounded by the thirty-two Heroines who stand around the edge of the moon cushion. They are all in the aspect of Vajrayogini and face the principal Deity in the centre. Around the edge of the moon-cushion, starting from the front and going counter-clockwise, there are the eight Heroines of the heart wheel of Heruka: Partzandi, Tzandriakiya, Parbhawatiya, Mahanasa, Biramatiya, Karwariya, Lamkeshoriya, and Druma-tzaya. These are followed by the eight Heroines of the speech wheel of Heruka: Airawatiya, Mahabhairawi, Bayubega, Sura-bhakiya, Shamadewi, Suwatre, Hayakarna, and Khaganana. These are followed by the eight Heroines of the body wheel of Heruka: Tzatrabega, Khandarohi, Shaundini, Tzatrawarmini, 129"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Subira, Mahabala, Tzatrawartini, and Mahabire. These are the twenty-four Heroines of the Twenty-four Places. Completing the circle of the thirty-two Heroines are the eight Heroines of the commitment wheel of Heruka: Kakase, Ulukase, Shonase, Shukarase, Yamadhathi, Yamaduti, Yamadangtrini, and Yama-matani. Y:fe imagine that the thirty-two letters of the three-OM mantra transform into these Heroines. For example, the first OM of the mantra transforms into the Heroine Partzandi, the second OM transforms into Tzandriakiya, the third OM transforms into Par-bhawatiya, the SAR transforms into Mahanasa, the WA trans-forms into Biramati and so on, finishing with the third PHAT which transforms into Yamaduti, the SO which transforms into Yamadangtrini, and the HA which transforms into Yamamatani. Inside the circle of thirty-two Heroines, the four letters YA, RA, LA, and WA transform into the four Goddesses. In the north the letter YA transforms into green Lama, in the west the letter RA transforms into red Khandarohi, in the south the letter LA transforms into yellow Rupini, and in the east the letter W A transforms into white Dakini. These four Goddesses look exactly like Vajrayogini except that each has a different colour. In the very centre, the red and white short-AH transforms into Vajrayogini herself. The four Goddesses of the four cardinal directions together with Vajrayogini are the Heroines of the great bliss wheel of Heruka. All the Heroes, the male Buddhas of Secret Mantra, and all the Heroines, the female Buddhas of Secret Mantra, are included within the Heroes and Heroines of the Twenty-four Places. Therefore, when we visualize the Heroes and Heroines of the Twenty-four Places in the form of the thirty-seven Hero-ines of the body mandala and their khatangas, in effect we visualize all the Buddhas. If we have strong faith that the thirty-seven Heroines are really at the centre of our heart, all the Buddhas will enter our heart and remain there. In this way our body will become very precious. Buddhas' bodies are not obstructed by matter. Wherever we visualize them, whether it be in front of us or at our heart, they will be there immediately. If we harbour doubts about this we deny ourselves the chance of receiving their blessings. When doing these practices we 130"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES need firm conviction in the existence of enlightened beings and in their ability to appear wherever and whenever we visualize them. In the Sutras Buddha said that he would be present whenever someone with faith visualized him. We ordinary beings cannot see Buddhas directly because we do not have sufficient merit. Our minds are obscured by dE!lusions and the propensities of unwholesome actions, just like a sun obscured by clouds. Although Buddhas exist we shall not be able to see them until we have dispelled our own mental obscurations. Until that time we should try to develop conviction that Bud-dhas are actually present whenever we visualize them. Without this conviction our practice of Secret Mantra, and especially that of the body mandala, will be unsuccessful. If we believe firmly that the Heroes and Heroines are at the centre of our heart channel wheel they will definitely enter and bless our channels, winds, and drops. We will draw closer to them and receive their care and guidance, and they will help us to develop spon-taneous great bliss. There are two important points to remember when we med-itate on the body mandala. The first is that !:he thirty-seven Heroines at the centre of our heart channel wheel are the real Heroines of Vajrayogini's Pure Land. The second is that their nature, or essence, is that of the channels, drops, and elements of our own body. If we do not recollect the first point we will not receive direct blessings from the Heroines, and if we do not recollect the second point our meditation will not be a body mandala practice. During the actual meditation on the body mandala, our mind should first focus on the principal Deity Vajrayogini at the centre of the moon cushion and remember that she is in essence our own indestructible drop. We then focus on each of the four Heroines in turn and remember that their nature is that of the four channels of the four directions at the heart. Then we focus on the thirty-two Heroines, remembering that their nature is that of the twenty-four channels of the twenty-four places and the eight channels of the eight doors of the sense powers. Having briefly focused on the thirty-two Heroines, we again focus on the four Heroines, and then on the main Deity. We repeat this cycle of analytical meditation several times, gradually 131"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND building up a visualization of the entire assembly. When we have a rough image of the assembly of thirty-seven Heroines we try to hold it with single-pointed concentration in placement meditation. At first we will not perceive each Heroine clearly and individually. We should be satisfied with a rough image of the whole assembly and focus single-pointedly on this. Using placement meditation, we try to merge our mind with the assembly of Heroines so that we lose the feeling of our mind and the assembly being separate. First we observe the assembly as if we were separate from it and then we dissolve our mind into the assembly so that our mind and the assembly become one. Then we meditate on it single-pointedly. To begin with, until we become familiar with the practice, we should do this meditation only for a short time. It is not advisable to concentrate for too long on subtle objects at the beginning. After meditating for a short time we rest for a while and then we begin analytical meditation again. We check from the central Vajrayogini to the four Heroines, to the thirty-two Heroines, and back again, and when we gain an image of the entire assembly, we place our mind on this single-pointedly. This is how to train gradually in the body mandala meditation. During the meditation our attention should not wander out-side the central channel. Keeping our attention focused within the central channel will cause our winds to enter, abide, and dissolve there. When this happens we will experience each of the signs of dissolution, from the mirage-like appearance up to the clear light. There are other ways of generating the body mandala but the method explained here is the most succinct. It was taught by Je Phabongkhapa and by Kyabje Trijang Dorjechang. ABSORBING THE WISDOM BEINGS AND MIXING THE THREE MESSENGERS This has two parts: 1 Absorbing the wisdom beings into the commitment beings 132"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES 2 Mixing the three messengers Absorbing the wisdom beings into the commitment beings Iri this practice there are two types of commitment being: ourself generated as Vajrayogini together with the thirty-seven Deities of the body mandala, and the visualized protection circle, char-nel grounds, and phenomena-source. The wisdom beings are the male and female Buddhas of the ten directions. When we invite them, we imagine that they arrive in the space before us in the same aspect as the commitment beings and then dissolve into the commitment beings, becoming one with them. While visualizing this, we recite the following lines from the sadhana: PHAIM Light rays radiate from the letter BAM at my heart and, leaving from between my eyebrows, go to th~~ ten direc-tions. They invite all the Tathagatas, Heroes, amd Yoginis of the ten directions in the aspect of Vajrayogini. We recite 'PHAIM' quite loudly to exhort the wisdom beings to come to us. While doing so we mentally recall bliss and empti-ness and physically perform the hand gesture called 'the blazing mudra'. To perform this gesture we first place the two tips of the thumbs together and, with our palms facing outwards, loosely hook the two index fingers together, with the right index finger crossing over the left. The two middle fingers slightly touch and the ring fingers and little fingers of both hands stretch upwards. The shape formed by the index fingers and thumbs is said to resemble the shape of a vagina, which symbolizes great bliss. The empty space between these fingers symbolizes emptiness. The combination of these two symbol-izes the union of great bliss and emptiness. The ring fingers and little fingers stretching upwards symbolize the blazing of the inner fire. This hand gesture reminds us to generate great bliss and emptiness. Initially, we hold our hands in this way at the left knee and then, whilst reciting PHAIM, we bring both hands up in an arc to the level of the forehead a:nd make nine 133"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND small circular movements of the hands, three counter-clockwise, three clockwise, and again three counter-clockwise. We then bring the hands down to the right knee. With the verbal exhortation PHAIM we invoke the wisdom beings. We imagine that all male and female Buddhas, the Heroes and Heroines of the ten directions appearing in the aspect of V ajrayogini, come to the space above our visualized mandala together with the entire mandala and Deities. The wisdom beings are identical in aspect to the commitment beings. Then we recite DZA HUM BAM HO. As we say DZA, the wisdom beings appear above the commitment beings. At the same time we perform the hand gesture called the 'hooking mudra'. To perform this mudra the index fingers and little fingers of each hand are extended and the middle fingers and ring fingers of each hand are tucked into their respective palms and held there with the thumbs. Then, with the right hand held palm downwards and the left hand palm upwards, the tip of the right index finger is placed on the tip of the little finger of the left hand. As we say HUM, the wisdom beings dissolve into the commit-ment beings. At the same time we perform the hand gesture called the 'rope mudra' or 'binding mudra'. This mudra is a mirror image of the 'hooking mudra'. Thus the left hand is held palm downwards and the right hand palm upwards and the left index finger is placed on the little finger of the right hand. As we say BAM, the wisdom beings and commitment beings become inseparably mixed. At the same time we perform the hand gesture called the 'iron chain mudra'. For this mudra the fingers are held as before but both palms face upwards and the index fingers and little fingers are loosely hooked together. As we say HO, the inseparable mixing of the wisdom beings and the commitment beings is stabilized. At the same time we perform the 'bell mudra'. We continue to hold down the middle finger and ring finger of each hand with the thumbs, and extend the index and little fingers as before. Then we cross the arms with the left forearm closest to the body, hold the left hand with fingers pointing upwards, and turn the right wrist so that the fingers point downwards with the palm facing outwards. 134"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES Both wrists are touching with the inside of the right wrist against the outside of the left wrist. This invocation is similar to the way in which an oracle invites a Deity to enter his body by means of his concentration. On such occasions there are many valid signs that the Deity actually enters the oracle's body. In a similar way, when we invoke the wisdom beings of Vajrayogini and invite them to enter the body of the self-generation, we should have no doubt that we have become unified with the wisdom being, Vajrayogini, and that our environment is Vajrayogini's Pure Land. The scriptures say that if we verbally recite PHAIM, perform the hand gesture, and recollect great bliss and emptiness, all the Buddhas will definitely come to us. Vajradhara himself promised that he would come with all the Buddhas whenever faithful practitioners called him. We need have no doubt about this. If we regularly make this powerful invocation, our mental continuum will receive the blessings of the Heroes and Heroines and we will gain confidence that the wisdom beings actually dissolve into us and remain with us always. Secret Mantra attainments are achieved largely through the power of faith and imagination. By vividly imagining that the wisdom beings dissolve into our body and believing that this actually happens, both our divine pride of being Vajrayogini and the clarity of our visualization will improve. Through this practice we will overcome ordinary conceptions and appear-ances and achieve Tantric realizations. Even though the absorp-tion of the wisdom beings is only imagined to start with, it still has these effects. Through continued practice, eventually the wisdom beings will actually enter our body whenever we invoke them, exactly as happens with an oracle. Having dissolved the wisdom beings of Vajrayogini into our-self, we then recite the mantra OM YOGA SHUDDHA SARW A DHARMA YOGA SHUDDHO HAM, which means, 'l am the nature of the yoga of the complete purity of all phenomena'. In this context 'yoga' refers to the union of bliss and emptiness. From the ultimate point of view all phenomena are in essence the union of great bliss and emptiness. Observing this all-embracing union of bliss and emptiness, we generate divine pride, thinking, 'This is me'. 135"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND When reciting this mantra we perform the hand gesture called 'giving the essence mudra'. To perform this mudra, we perform the lotus-turning mudra three times - first from the left side of the chest, then from the right side of the chest, then at the heart -and then we perform the embracing mudra. The first mudra symbolizes the inner winds of the left channel gathering into the central channel; the second symbolizes the inner winds of the right channel gathering into the central channel; the third symbolizes all the winds dissolving within the central channel at the heart; and the fourth symbolizes the union of Father and Mother in embrace. We hold this mudra briefly while we recall great bliss inseparable from emptiness. This is the secret Vajra-yogini that is generated during the Vajrayogini empowerment. While reciting the mantra and making the hand gesture, we imagine that our mind of great bliss mixes with the ultimate nature of all phenomena. We then take this union of great bliss and emptiness as the basis upon which to impute I, and gener-ate divine pride of being the Truth Body. At the same time we recite 'I am the nature of the yoga of the complete purity of all phenomena'. This experience is very profound and its real meaning is not easy to understand. Correct practice of this meditation combines the mixing of the outer, inner, and secret messengers. In the sixth yoga, the yoga of self-generation, we visualize the inner Vajrayogini, the letter BAM. Now, in the yoga of being blessed by Heroes and Heroines, we first absorb the outer Vajrayoginis, the Dakinis of the Twenty-four Holy Places, and then we identify the secret Vajrayogini, or the definitive Vajrayogini, which is the union of bliss and emptiness. Mixing the three messengers A messenger is someone who fulfils the wishes of two people by relaying a message between them. In this practice there are said to be three kinds of messenger: outer messengers, inner messengers, and secret messengers. The outer messengers are the Heroines who reside in the Twenty-four Places of Heruka and in the Pure Land of the Dakinis. They are invited when we 136"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HE:ROINES invoke the wisdom beings to dissolve into the commitment beings. They are called messengers because they fulfil the wishes of those practitioners who want to attain spontaneous great bliss. The inner messengers are the thirty-seven channels of our body that appear in the aspect of the Heroines of the body mandala. Through concentration we can penetrate these channels, cause the winds to enter, abide, and dissolve within the central channel, and thereby generate spontaneous great bliss. The secret messengers are the many levels of realization of spontaneously-born exalted wisdom, which are the main cause of Buddhahood, our ultimate aim. Inner messengers are the observed objects of completion stage meditation and secret messengers are the realizations attained as a result. In the practice of mixing the three messengers we invite the outer messengers, the Heroines of the Twenty-four Places and the Pure Land of the Dakinis, to dissolve into the inner messen-gers, the channels of our body, and then we ima~~ne that we generate the secret messenger, a mind of great bliss indivisibly mixed with emptiness. In one Vajrayogini prayer it says: 0 venerable and beautiful Lady of Dakini Land, Through receiving assistance from the three outer messengers And meditating on the three inner messengers, May I attain the three secret messengers. An outer messenger is anyone who helps us to generate great bliss. There are three kinds of outer messenger: supreme, mid-dling, and minor. A supreme outer messenger is one who has attained the Union that Needs Learning or the Union of No More Learning, a middling outer messenger is one who has attained completion stage realizations but not Union, and a minor outer messenger is one who has some experience of generation stage but not of completion stage. Inner messengers are also of three kinds. The supreme inner messengers are the central channel and the four heart channels, the middling inner messengers are the twenty-four channels of the twenty-four places of the body, and the minor inner messengers are the eight channels of the eight doors of the 137"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND sense powers. Meditation on the central channel and four heart channels is the quickest and most powerful method to centralize the winds and to experience spontaneous great bliss. Meditative penetration of the twenty-four channels of the twenty-four inner places is a less powerful method for centralizing winds than meditating on the central channel itself, but it is more powerful than meditating on other channels such as the eight channels of the eight doors of the sense powers. Meditative penetration of the eight channels will also cause the winds to enter the central channel but this is the least powerful method for experiencing spontaneous great bliss. Therefore the eight channels are called 'minor inner messengers'. The meditations on the three inner messengers include medi-tations on the winds and the drops as well as on the channels. An example of the first is the vajra recitation meditation, also known as the 'yoga of wind', which is explained in detail in the commentaries to the grounds and paths of Highest Yoga Tantra. This is an excellent method for bringing the winds into the central channel and thereby causing spontaneous great bliss to arise. An example of the second is the meditation of inner fire, also called 'tummo' or the 'yoga of drops', which is another excellent method to experience spontaneous great bliss. In this meditation we focus on the red blood cell, or drop, located at the navel which has the nature of inner fire. Any method that causes the experience of spontaneous great bliss is called a messenger. Secret messengers are also of three types: a supreme secret messenger is a mind of spontaneous great bliss meditating on and directly realizing emptiness; a middling secret messenger is a mind of spontaneous great bliss meditating on a generic image of emptiness; and a minor secret messenger is achieved when we simply imagine that we attain a spontaneous great bliss that meditates on emptiness and becomes indivisible from it. Even though this last meditation is not a complete realization it is called a secret messenger because it helps us to develop the actual realization of the union of great bliss and emptiness. In summary, we attain the three secret messengers by pen-etrating the three inner messengers with the assistance of the three outer messengers. To penetrate the inner messengers it 138"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES is necessary to meditate on our channels, winds, and drops. There are many outer messengers who will assist us in our practice, but it is very important that our meditation on the channels, winds, and drops is done correctly. The knots of the heart channel wheel can be loosened by means of completion stage meditation in which the inner winds enter and dissolve within the central channel at the heart and cause us to experience great bliss. However, although we can loosen the knots through solitary meditation, we cannot untie them completely without relying on an outer messenger. At the time of death, the knots of the heart channel wheel completely untie through the force of karma allowing our consciousness to leave the body, but to untie the knots completely before death we need the assistance of an outer messenger, or an 'action mudra', with whom we can strengthen and improve our experi-ence of great bliss. When all the knots of the heart channel wheel are completely untied through meditation and reliance upon an action mudra, practitioners will attain a level of realiza-tion called 'isolated mind of ultimate example dear light'. This clear light of great bliss is a secret messenger, and once we have gained this realization we will certainly attain enlightenment before death. By relying on the outer messengers and meditating on the inner messengers, we generate the secret messengers. Unifying the three kinds of messengers in this way is called mixing the three messengers. PUTTING ON THE ARMOUR There are three main reasons for putting on armour. The first is to stabilize the absorption of the wisdom beings into the commitment beings, the second is to safeguard against external obstacles such as harmful spirits, and the third is to protect ourselves from inner obstacles such as delusions and sickness, which disturb our concentration on generation stage practice. Just as warriors used armour to protect themselves in battle, so meditators need armour to defend themselves against obstacles and hindrances. 139"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND There are two systems for wearing armour. One is to visualize Deities marked on the body and the other is to visualize the seed-letters of Deities marked on the body. When the practice is done elaborately, as in the extensive Heruka sadhana, Deities are visualized marked on the body, but in both the extensive and the condensed sadhanas ofVajrayogini only the seed-letters of the Deities are visualized. In Secret Mantra it is important to recognize that Deities and their seed-letters have the same nature. For instance, the thirty-two letters of the three-OM mantra are the same nature as the thirty-two Deities of Vajrayogini's body mandala. We will not accomplish supramundane attainments if we regard mantras and Deities as being different in nature. In the practice of Vajrayogini the seed-letters of six Goddesses are visualized at various points of the body, between the skin and flesh. The six Goddesses are: Vajravarahi, the consort of Buddha Akshobya; Yamani, the wrathful aspect of Lochana, the consort of Buddha Vairochana; Mohani, the wrathful aspect of Benzarahi, the consort of Buddha Amitabha; Sachalani, the wrathful aspect of Vajradhatuishvari, the consort of Buddha Vajradhara; Samtrasani, the wrathful aspect of Mamaki, the consort of Buddha Ratnasambhava; and Chandika, the wrathful aspect of Tara, the consort of Buddha Amoghasiddhi. At the level of our navel, we visualize a moon mandala, which is standing upright, and at its centre we visualize the red letters OM BAM on the right and left respectively. Although they have the aspect of letters they are in essence Vajravarahi. At the level of our heart there is an upright moon mandala. At its centre there are the blue letters HAM YOM, on the right and left respectively. They are in essence Yamani. At the top of our neck, just under the chin, there is an upright moon mandala which has at its centre the white letters HRIM MOM, on the right and left respectively. They are in essence Mohani. At our forehead in the centre of an upright moon mandala there are the yellow letters HRIM HRIM. They are in essence Sachalani. At our crown in the centre of a moon mandala which is lying flat there are the green-coloured letters HUM HUM. They are in essence Samtrasani. At both shoulders, both wrists, both hips, and both ankles in the centre of upright moon mandalas there 140"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES are the smoke-coloured letters PHAT PHAT. They are in essence Chandika. In the sadhana it says that these letters are 'at all my limbs', but the meaning is that they are at the eight places mentioned here. These places are known as 'the eight great joints'. In each case the two letters at each point symbolize the Father and Mother of each Buddha Family. The lette?rs on the right side symbolize the Father and those on the left symbolize the Mother. For instance, at the navel the OM symbolizes Aksho-bya, the Father of the Vajra Family, and the BAM symbolizes Vajravarahi, the Mother of that Family. From the green letters HUM HUM at our crown, green light radiates between the skin and flesh, causing the surface of our skull above the forehead to be protected by a layer of green light. This does not, however, alter the colour of the outer layer of our skin. This remains red because we have generated ourselves as Vajrayogini. From the yellow letters HRIM HRIM at the forehead, yellow light radiates between the skin and flesh down to the neck. From the white letters HR1M MOM at the neck, white light radiates down and around the body to the heart. From the blue letters HAM YOM at the heart, blue light radiates down to the navel. From the red letters OM BAM at the navel, red light radiates down to the hips. From the letters PHAT PHAT at the hips, smoke-coloured light radiates to the ankles. From the letters PHAT PHAT at the ankles, smoke-col-oured light radiates down to the tips of the toes. From the letters PHAT PHAT at the shoulders, smoke-coloured light radi-ates down to the wrists, and from the letters PHAT PHAT at the wrists, smoke-coloured light radiates to our fingertips. There are no gaps between the different coloured lights so that every part of our body, between the flesh and skin, is suffused with these radiant lights. In summary, we imagine that our body is enclosed within a protective layer of light, which, in essence, is the five Buddha Families. Our body and mind are filled with their wisdom. In this way the wisdom beings remain one with us and prevent any obstacles from penetrating our body and mind. It is import-ant to have strong faith that these lights are the same nature as the great bliss and emptiness of the five Buddha Families. This 141"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND conviction will prevent us from receiving any harm. In effect, we are creating an inner protection circle. GRANTING EMPOWERMENT AND ADORNING THE CROWN There now follows an explanation of three practices: granting empowerment and adorning the crown, making offerings to the self-generation, and the eight-line praise to the Mother. Although these are not directly listed within the eleven yogas they are an important part of the self-generation practice. From the point of view of uncommon appearances, when Buddha Shakyamuni was born, the five Buddha Families of the ten directions anointed his body with the five nectars. Here we imagine that we, the newly-born Vajrayogini, receive the same empowerment. First we recite PHAIM while performing the blazing mudra. We visualize light rays radiating from the letter BAM at our heart and inviting the empowering Deities of Heruka' s mandala to appear in the space above us. We then request these Deities, together with all the Buddhas, to grant us empowerment. The eight Goddesses of the doorways respond to our request by driving away all hindrances, the twenty-four Heroes such as Khandakapala chant auspicious verses, the twenty-four Hero-ines such as Partzandi sing vajra songs on emptiness, and the offering goddesses such as Rupavajra and Shaptavajra make offerings to the principal Deity Heruka. The principal Deity consents to grant the empowerment and Vajravarahi and the four Mothers, Lama, Khandarohi, Rupini, and Dakini, hold aloft precious jewelled vases filled with the five wisdom nectars and pour the nectar onto our crown. The nectar enters through our crown channel wheel, filling our entire body and purifying all obstructions and negative actions of body, speech, and mind. A little nectar overflows through our crown channel wheel and transforms into Buddha Vairochana-Heruka together with his consort who sit withiri the multi-faceted jewel of our crown ornament. Buddha Vairochana-Heruka and his consort are both white. The Father sits in the vajra posture holding a wheel in 142"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES his right hand and a bell in his left hand at the level of his heart. Vairochana-Heruka is the method aspect of all Buddhas appearing in the form of a Deity, and Vajrayogini is the wisdom aspect of all Buddhas appearing as a Deity. Vajrayogini actually belongs to the Family of Akshobya,. but. here she is adorned by Vairochana-Heruka to demonstrate the union of method and wisdom. This is one of many symbols of the union of method and wisdom to be found throughout the practice of Vajrayogini. MAKING OFFERINGS TO THE SELF-GENERATION According to some traditions, it is not necessary to make offer-ings to ourself generated as the Deity; offerings to the in-front-generated Deity are said to suffice. Je Tsongkhapa, however, gave many explanations showing the importance of making offerings to the self-generation and cited Tantras to support his reasoning. In the Root Tantra of Heruka it states: Making offerings to oneself Becomes an offering to all Buddhas. This is because when we absorbed the wisdom beings, all the Buddhas dissolved and merged inseparably with ourself gener-ated as Vajrayogini. Moreover, during the practice of bringing death into the path of the Truth Body, all environments and beings, including all Buddhas, are dissolved into the clear light, and this clear light is identified as the Dharmakaya, which is one with the minds of all Buddhas. From this clear light we arise in the form of the Emanation Body of Vajrayogini. The self-generation therefore is the synthesis of all Buddhas, and so when we make offerings to the self-generation we are making offerings to all Buddhas. Making offerings to ourself generated as the Deity is an especially powerful method for accumulating merit. If we main-tain the awareness that we are Vajrayogini throughout the day, then whatever we enjoy, such as food and drinl<, becomes an offering to the Deity. It is only in Secret Mantra that we have the opportunity to create merit in this way. If we fail to make offerings to the self-generation the power 143"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND of our practice of Secret Mantra will diminish. Great Tantric scholars and meditators of the past, including Buddha Shakya-muni, have stated that Tantric practice is characterized by the four complete purities: the complete purity of place, the com-plete purity of body, the complete purity of deeds, and the complete purity of enjoyments. In the practice of Vajrayogini the complete purity of place is the transformation of our environment into Vajrayogini's mancj.ala, the complete purity of body is the transformation of our body into that of Vajra-yogini, the complete purity of deeds is the practice of the yoga of purifying migrators, and the complete purity of enjoyments is attained when every enjoyment is viewed as an offering to the self-generation. If we omit these offerings our practice will not have the fourth complete purity and so it will not be a fully-qualified Tantric practice. It will lack the full power, quality, and benefits of a Secret Mantra practice. Therefore, it is important to make offerings to ourself generated as Vajrayogini. The way to bless the eight outer offerings has already been explained. To make the outer offerings to the self-generation we imagine that offering goddesses emanate from our heart, take replica offerings from those blessed previously, and offer them to ourself generated as Vajrayogini. Whilst visualizing this, we recite the offering mantras and perform the accompany-ing hand gestures. After making the eight offerings we make the offerings of th~ six knowledge-goddesses, Rupavajra and so forth, together with their offering mantras and hand ges-tures. The Heruka sadhana contains the more elaborate offer-ings of the sixteen knowledge-goddesses. To make the inner offering to the self-generation we imagine that many offering goddesses emanate from our heart and fill their skullcups with inner offering from the large skullcup of blessed nectar. As we recite the three-OM mantra for the inner offering these goddesses offer the nectar to us, generated as Vajrayogini, and to the thirty-seven Deities of the body man-dala. We then recite OM AH HUM and taste the inner offering. To make the secret offering and suchness offering to the self-generation we visualize that the khatanga that we support on our left shoulder transforms into Father Heruka. He enters into embrace with us, generated as Vajrayogini. Through this 144"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES embrace the inner fire at Heruka's navel blazes, causing the white bodhichitta at his crown to melt and flow down his central channel. This white bodhichitta reaches our sex organ and enters the lower tip of our central channel. It then begins to ascend through our central channel. When it reaches our navel we experience joy, when it reaches our heart we experience supreme joy, when it reaches our throat we experience extra-ordinary joy, and when it reaches our crown we experience spontaneous great joy. As we experience the fourth joy, we imagine that the thirty-seven Deities at our heart also experience spontaneous great joy. We meditate for a short time on this experience of spontaneous great joy. This experience· is the secret offering. We then recall emptiness and try to merge our mind of spontaneous great bliss with emptiness. Meditating on this is the suchness offering. Another method for making the secret and such:ness offerings is to change our aspect from that of Vajrayogini into that of Heruka and, through embrace with V ajrayogini, called the 'secret Mother' in the sadhana, imagine that we experience the four joys. After making these offerings we then resume the form of Vajrayogini. Both methods are equally valid and we can choose either. Je Phabongkhapa says that the first method may be more suitable for female practitioners and the second for male practitioners. There is another special method to experience the four joys that can be practised at this point. If our· motivation is com-pletely pure, we should try to receive oral instructions on this method from a qualified Tantric Spiritual Guide. THE EIGHT LINES OF PRAISE TO THE MOTHER When the four types of offering have been completed, we eman-ate praising goddesses who respectfully press their palms together and recite the eight-line. praise to us, generated as Vajrayogini. This praise was taught by Vajradhara and it is an especially blessed practice. For practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini these words are the most supreme of all praises. Merely reciting these praises will cause Vajrayogini and all the 145"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Deities of Heruka' s mandala to draw closer to us and remain with us constantly. We can also use these praises to pay homage to other Oeities, regarding them and their environment as one in nature with Vajrayogini and her Pure Land. By doing this we glorify all holy beings. Practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini can regard anyone they meet as an emanation of Heruka or Vajrayogini and recite the eight-line praises of Heruka or Vajrayogini to them. By sincerely reciting these praises we will swiftly purify our ordin-ary appearances and reach outer Dakini Land. Even if we are confronted with an aggressive and vicious criminal we should not dwell upon ordinary appearances but regard him as an emanation of Heru,ka or Vajrayogini and silently make praises to him with these eight lines. Through gradually gaining famili-arity with this practice we can come to view all beings as pure. We can even extend this pure view to inanimate objects such as mountains, lakes, buildings, and the earth itself. We should not be misled by the external aspect of any object but should think that its real nature is the same as that of Heruka and Vajrayogini and then praise it with the eight lines. This helps us to overcome ordinary appearances and causes. us to attain the outer Pure Land of Vajrayogini. Many texts on Heruka Tantra, including Illuminating All Hidden Meanings by Je Tsongkhapa, describe Heruka in two ways. The conventional view of Heruka, called the interpretive :tferuka, is that Heruka is an Emanation Body of Vajradhara, with a blue-coloured body, four faces, and twelve hands. The ultimate view of Heruka, called the definitive Heruka, is that Heruka is a mind of great bliss that is inseparably mixed with emptiness. Since the ultimate nature of afl phenomena is empti-ness, the definitive Heruka pervades all phenomena. In Tibetan the definitive Heruka is called 'kyabdag' Heruka. 'Kyab' means 'pervasive' and 'dag' means 'nature', so 'kyabdag' means 'the same nature as all phenomena'. From this profound viewpoint, all the Deities such as Guhyasamaja, Yamantaka, Heruka, and Vajrayogini are in essence the same. Every Yidam, including Vajrayogini, has a definitive and an interpretive nature. By understanding the definitive Vajrayogini or Heruka there is 146"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND HEROINES great hope that we will be able to perceive whatever appears to our mind as Vajrayogini or Heruka. Through their devotion and sincere practice of these instruc-tions, practitioners draw close to Heruka and Vajrayogini and become as if one with them. If we make offerings and praises to such practitioners we will create great merit and our mind will be blessed. At this point in the sadhana, the eight-line praise is recited in Sanskrit. An explanation of the English translation is given as follows: OM I prostrate to Vajravarahi, the Blessed Mother HUM HUMPHAT In each line of this praise OM symbolizes the body, speech, and mind of V ajrayogini to whom we are offering praise. All Buddhas have totally destroyed their ignorance through the perfection of wisdom, and Vajravarahi, or Vajrayogini, is the embodiment of the perfection of wisdom of all Buddhas. The Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit name Vajravarahi is Dorje Pagmo. Here, 'pag' means pig. The pig is a symbol of ignorance, which is why it is depicted at the very centre of the wheel of life. By calling Vajrayogini 'Vajravarahi' we are praising her as the essence of the perfection of wisdom that destroys ignorance. She is the 'Blessed Mother' because she has destroyed the four maras and possesses all the good qualities of a Buddha. At the end of each line we recite HUM HUM PHAT. With the first HUM we make the request 'Please grant me the mundane attainments such as increased wealth, life-span, and merit'. With the second HUM we make the request 'Please grant me the supramundane attainments such as the realization of spontaneous great bliss, the Union that Needs Learning, and the Union of No More Learning'. With 'PHAT' we request the destruction of the outer, inner, and secret obstacles that prevent us from gaining these attainments. OM To the Superior and powerful Knowledge Lady unconquered by the three realms HUM HUM PHAT Here, 'Superior' refers to Vajrayogini' s mind, which sees directly the ultimate nature of all phenomena, and 'powerful 147"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Knowledge Lady' means that she has the power to bestow great bliss upon Heruka and upon practitioners. 'Unconquered by the three realms' means that she has abandoned all delusions of the desire, form, and formless realms. OM To you who destroy all fears of evil spirits with your great vajra HUM HUM PHAT Here, 'great vajra' means spontaneous great bliss. Her wisdom of· spontane:::msly-born great bliss inseparable from emptiness destroys all harm from evil spirits. OM To you with controlling eyes who remain as the vajra seat unconquered by others HUM HUM PHAT Vajrayogini is the vajra seat of Heruka who is always in union with her. While remaining unconquered by others she can con-trol them just by looking at them.

If someone has no ordinary appearances and no ordinary conceptions they cannot be harmed by external demons; therefore they are said to have conquered them. OM To you who conquer all those who make us dull, rigid, and confused HUM HUM PHAT Vajrayogini enables us to overcome all harms inflicted by evil spirits who can interfere with our practice by causing us to become physically dull or heavy, verbally rigid-for example, unable to pronounce mantras clearly - or mentally confused about our practice. 148"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF BEING BLESSED BY HEROES AND H:E!ROINES OM I bow to Vajravarahi, the Great Mother, the Dakini consort who fulfils all desires HUM HUM PHAT Because Vajrayogini is a manifestation of the perfection of wisdom, known as 'the Great Mother of all the Buddhas', she destroys the ignorance of all sentient beings and has the power to fulfil the wishes of all living beings. 149"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Actual Meditation of Generation Stage Although it is part of the sixth yoga, the yoga of self-generation, the actual generation stage meditation is explained here because it is at this point in the sadhana that we train in improving our concentration on divine pride and clear appearance. The actual meditation of generation stage is presented in three parts: 1 What is generation stage? 2 Training in gross generation stage meditation 3 Training in subtle generation stage meditation WHAT IS GENERATION STAGE? Generation stage is a realization of a creative yoga that is achieved as a result of pure concentration on bringing the three bodies into the path, in which one mentally generates oneself as a Tantric Deity and one's surroundings as the Deity's mandala. Meditation on generation stage is called a 'creative yoga' because its object is created by correct imagination. The preceding eight yogas are necessary preparations for suc-cessful practice of actual generation stage meditation. The eleven yogas are like the limbs of a body and the actual genera-tion stage meditation is like the body itself. This special method of combining actual generation stage meditation with recitation of the sadhana was taught and emphasized by Je Tsongkhapa. Nagarjuna advised that we should progress step by step from generation stage to completion stage in the same way that we climb a staircase. The main purpose of doing generation stage meditation is to prepare the ground for the later development of completion stage realizations. Without first engaging in 150"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL MEDITATION OF GENERATION STAGE generation stage meditation we cannot succeed in completion stage meditation. TRAINING IN GROSS GENERATION STAGE MEDITATION This has two parts: 1 Training in divine pride 2 Training in clear appearance Training in divine pride Divine pride is a special way of regarding ourself in which we imagine that we are a Tantric Deity and that our environment is his or her Pure Land. Although it is called 'pride', divine pride it is not a delusion; it is totally different from deluded pride. Deluded pride causes only rebirth in cyclic existence, whereas generating the divine pride of being Vajrayogini leads only to liberation. At the beginning of actual generation stage meditation, we should cultivate divine pride and then, based on this, develop clear appearance. The principal objects to be abandoned during generation stage meditation are ordinary conception and ordin-ary appearance. Divine pride overcomes ordinary conception and clear appearance overcomes ordinary appearance. The terms 'ordinary conception' and 'ordinary appearance' are best explained by the following example. Suppose there is a Vajrayogini practitioner called John. Normally he sees himself as John and his environment, enjoyments, body, and mind as John's. These appearances are ordinary appearances. The mind that assents to these ordinary appearances by holding them to be true is ordinary conception. Ordinary conceptions are obstructions to liberation and ordinary appearances are obstruc-tions to omniscience. All sentient beings, except Bodhisattvas of the tenth ground who have attained the vajra-like concen-tration of the path of meditation, have ordinary appearance. 151"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Now, if John were to meditate on the generation stage of Vajrayogini, strongly regarding himself as Vajrayogini and believing his surroundings, experiences, body, and mind to be those of Vajrayogini, at that time he would have the divine pride that prevents ordinary conception. If he were also to achieve clear appearance of himself as Vajrayogini with the environment, enjoyments, body, and mind of Vajrayogini, at that time he would have the clear appearance that prevents him from perceiving ordinary appearances. At the beginning, ordinary conception is more harmful than ordinary appearance. How this is so is illustrated by the follow-ing analogy. Suppose a magician conjures up an illusion of a tiger in front of an audience. The tiger appears to b<?th the audience and the magician, but whereas the audience believe there actually is a tiger in front of them and consequently become afraid, the magician does not believe that the tiger actually exists, and so he remains calm. The problem for the audience is not so much that a tiger appears to them, as their conception that the tiger actually exists. It is this conception rather than the mere appearance of the tiger that causes them to experience fear. If, like the magician, they had no conception that the tiger exists, then even though they still had an appear-ance of a tiger, they would not be afraid. In the same way, even though things appear to us as ordinary, if we do not conceptually grasp them as ordinary this will not be so harmful. Similarly, it is less damaging to our spiritual development to .see our Spiritual Guide as ordinary and yet hold him or her to be in essence a Buddha than it is to see our Spiritual Guide as ordinary and to believe that he or she is ordinary. The convic-tion that our Spiritual Guide is a Buddha, even though he or she may appear to us as an ordinary person, helps our spiritual practices to progress rapidly. Ordinary conceptions are reduced by developing divine pride. For this reason we need to emphasize the development of divine pride at the very outset of our training in generation stage. To meditate on divine pride it is essential to forget our ordinary body and mind. If we continue to perceive our ordin-ary body and mind this will obstruct our development of divine pride. Therefore, when we meditate on divine pride, we must 152"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL MEDITATION OF GENERATION STAGE ensure that we lose all awareness of our ordinary body and mind by imagining that instead we have achieved Vajrayogini's pure body and mind. Then, in order to subdue our ordinary conceptions and improve our divine pride, we can contemplate the following three reasons: 1. I am no longer an ordinary being because my ordinary body, mind, and environment have been purified through the practice of bringing the three bodies into the path. During this practice I actually died and took rebirth as Vajrayogini in her Pure Land. 2. When I absorbed the wisdom beings I dissolved all Buddhas in the form of Vajrayogini into myself. Therefore I am one with Vajrayogini and my nature is the same as that of all Buddhas. 3. The ordinary deluded pride I have had until now results only in suffering and continued rebirth in samsara, but divine pride will lead me to liberation and Vajrayogini's Pure Land. Therefore I shall never give up this pure pride of being Vajrayogini. Contemplating these three reasons, or any other helpful reasons, is analytical meditation. When, as a result of this reasoning, divine pride arises in our mind we try to hold it with single-pointed concentration in placement meditation. We then need continually to strengthen our divine pride through repeated meditation. It is very important not to mistake the basis upon which we) generate divine pride. If a practitioner called John tries to develop divine pride of being Vajrayogini on the basis of his ordinary body and mind, he is completely mistaken. John's body and mind are contaminated aggregates and are a valid basis of imputation for John, but they cannot be a basis of imputation for Vajrayogini. The appearances of John's body and mind are ordinary appearances and assenting to these appearances is ordinary conception, which is contrary to divine pride. When we generate the divine pride of being Vajrayogini in her Pure Land we must first prevent our normal conception and appearance of ourself, as well as of our environment, body, and mind. We need to dispel these from our mind completely. Having eliminated ordinary appearances, we should then use 153"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND our imagination to try to perceive Vajrayogini's environment and. body, and look upon these as our own environment and body. These are the bases upon which we generate divine pride by firmly deciding 'I am Vajrayogini surrounded by my pure environment and pure enjoyments'. Training in clear appearance There are two ways to train in clear appearance: 1 Training in clear appearance on the general aspect 2 Training irt clear appearance on specific aspects Training in clear appearance on the general aspect Those who have already gained some skill in meditation can immediately begin training in clear appearance on the general aspect, that is on oneself and the complete mandala of Vajra-yogini viewed as a whole. If this is too difficult, we can begin by training in clear appearance on specific aspects until we gain more familiarity, and then proceed to train in clear appearance on the general aspect. To meditate on clear appearance of the general a_spect we begin by doing analytical meditation in order to achieve a gen-eric image of the entire mandala. We check from the fire circle, yajra fence, charnel grounds, and phenomena-source up to the lotus, sun, and ourself, Vajrayogini, and then back again. We continue in this way until we have a rough image of ourself, Vajrayogini, together with the entire mandala and all the beings within it. We then try to hold this image with single-pointed concentration in placement meditation. Gradually, through repeated meditation, we improve our clear appearance of our-self as V ajrayogini in her mandala. When we have a rough image of ourself as Vajrayogini sur-rounded by her mandala we have found the object of actual generation stage meditation. We have also achieved the first of the nine levels of concentration of tranquil abiding, which is called 'placing the mind'. Through regular daily practice, and 154"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL MEDITATION OF GENERATION STAGE sometimes in short or longer retreat, we should improve this concentration until we achieve the fourth level of concentration on generation stage called close placement'. At this point, if we enter a strict retreat with the aim of achieving tranquil abiding on generation stage it is possible to achieve this within six months. After attaining tranquil abiding on generation stage it will not be long before we achieve outer Pure Dakini Land. A more detailed explanation on the method for attaining tranquil abiding is given in Joyful Path of Good Fortune. Training in clear appeariince on specific aspects The 'specific aspects' are specific objects within the mandala. For instance, we can focus first on the central eye of Vajrayogini until we perceive it clearly. Then, without forgetting this, we focus on the other two eyes, and then on the face, neck, torso, arms, legs, and so forth, until we have a mental image of the entire body. Gradually we can include the phenomena-source, eight charnel grounds, and protection circle. Contemplating each aspect in this way will help us finally to gain clear appear-ance of the entire supporting and supported mandala. Once we have achieved this we train in concentration as before. In this way, through training in analytical and placement meditation, we should improve our clear appearance until we complete the realizations of both gross and subtle generation stages. TRAINING IN SUBTLE GENERATION STAGE MEDITATION The protection circle, charnel grounds, phenomena-source, and self-generation, all have gross and subtle features. The vajra ground, fence, tent, canopy, surrounding fires, charnel grounds, phenomena-source, lotus, sun, Kalarati and Bhairawa, and our body in the aspect of Vajrayogini are the gross features. They are the objects of gross generation stage meditation. Their constituent parts, such as the tiny vajras within the vajra fence, are the subtle features. A meditation using these subtle features as the object is called 'meditation on subtle generation stage'. 155"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND Through constant training in meditation to improve clear appearance of the gross objects, eventually we will directly perceive with our mental consciousness the entire mandala, from the fire circle to the self-generation, as clearly as we now see things with our eyes. When we gain this experience in meditation we have attained the complete realization of gross generation stage meditation. Through further training in medi-tation we will improve our clear appearance of the subtle objects, until eventually we are able to perceive them directly with our mental consciousness as clearly as we now see objects with our eyes. When we attain this realization we will have completed the subtle generation stage meditation. The supreme object of subtle generation stage meditation is Vajrayogini's body mandala. When we can see the thirty-seven Dakinis of the body mandala directly we have completed subtle generation stage. If at the same time our winds gather and dissolve into the central channel at the heart channel wheel, we will attain completion stage realizations. From this we can see that skilful meditation on the body mandala of Vajrayogini is a real inner wish-fulfilling jewel that satisfies the wishes of pure practitioners. We might find it difficult to believe that it is possible for ordin-ary beings directly to perceive themselves as a Deity and their environment as a Buddha's Pure Land. We should consider that although our present body and mind are not the I, nevertheless due to strong familiarity with self-grasping we directly and vividly see our I as one with our body and mind. Because of this, whenever our body is unwell we say 'I am unwell', and whenever our mind is unhappy we say 'I am unhappy'. If, through familiarity with self-grasping ignorance, we can come to identify with a contaminated body and mind, then through correct imagination and pure concentration we can certainly come to identify ourselves as Vajrayogini. Then, through famili-arizing ourselves with generation stage meditation, we shall definitely come to perceive ourselves directly as Vajrayogini. This has been the experience of many Tantric meditators. There is an account of a Yamantaka practitioner who through his clear appearance of being Yamantaka saw himself as the 156"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL MEDITATION OF GENERATION STAGE real Deity in every detail, including the horns on his head. He felt as if he could even touch the horns. Whenever he wanted to go through a door he would bend down to allow room for his horns to pass through. Although he was not actually Yamantaka, his clear appearance of himself as the Deity Yaman-taka was not a mistaken appearance. If something is a mistaken appearance it necessarily arises from ignorance. If a Tantric practitioner sees himself as a real Yamantaka or Vajrayogini, this clear appearance arises from his or her pure concentration and not from ignorance. Such experiences are evident only to the practitioner himself; other people will continue to see him as an ordinary person. People with no experience of Tantric meditation may find it difficult to believe that it is possible to change our identity from an ordinary person into a Deity, but by developing a correct understanding of how persons lack true existence and are mere imputations we will realize that it is definitely possible. This will help us to experience deep realiza-tions of Tantra and enable us to gain an understanding of the two truths according to Highest Yoga Tantra -· meaning clear light and the illusory body - which is essential for the practice of the completion stage. 157"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Paldiin Lama Tiin .. pa Sonam Gyaltsiin"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Yoga of Verbal and Mental Recitation This has four parts: 1 The mantra to be recited 2 The benefits of reciting this mantra 3 Actual mantra recitation 4 Explanation of close retreat THE MANTRA TO BE RECITED Vajravarahi and Vajrayogini have many different aspects such as Sangye Khandroma, or Buddha Dakini; Do:rje Rabngama, or Vajra Speech Dakini; Dorje Nampar Ngangtsema, or Vajra Form Dakini; and so forth.

The three-OM mantra is: OM OM OM SARWA BUDDHA DAKINIYE V AJRA WARNANIYE VAJRA BEROTZANIYE HUM HUM HUM PHAT PHAT PHAT S6HA. This mantra originally comes from the forty-eighth and fiftieth chapters of the Root Tantra of Heruka. The three OMs that begin the mantra and give it its name signify that Vajrayogini is the embodiment of the Three Bodies of all Buddhas. The first OM 159"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND symbolizes the Truth Body of all Buddhas, the second OM the Enjoyment Body of all Buddhas, and the third OM the Emana-tion Body of all Buddhas. SARW A BUDDHA DAKINIYE literally means 'All the Buddhas' Dakinis'. In this context, 'Dakini' is the inner Dakini, the clear light mind of a Buddha, and so SARW A BUDDHA DAKINIYE reveals that Vajrayogini is in nature the clear light mind of all Buddhas. VAJRA WARNANIYE means 'Vajra Speech Dakini' and indic-ates Vajrayogini is in nature the vajra speech of all Buddhas. VAJRA BEROTZANIYE means 'Vajra Form Dakini' and indic-ates Vajrayogini is the vajra body of all Buddhas. Here, 'vajra' refers to great bliss inseparable from emptiness. HUM HUM HUM is a request to Vajrayogini: 'Please grant me the blessings of your body, speech, and mind so that I may attain the Vajra body, speech, and mind of a Buddha'. PHAT PHAT PHAT is the request: 'Please pacify my outer, inner, and secret obstacles'. SOHA conveys the request: 'Please help me to build the foun-dation of all attainments'. Some commentaries interpret the letters OM OM OM, HUM HUM HUM, and PHAT PHAT PHAT slightly differently, but there are no contradictions between these different interpretations. By reciting the mantra we are calling Vajrayogini and her thirty-two Dakinis and entreating them. It is important not to regard the letters of the three-OM mantra as ordinary. We should regard them as having the same nature as the thirty-two Dakinis. In the Root Tantra of Heruka it says: If you wish to achieve the supreme attainment Do not view the mantra as being different from the Deities. The three-OM mantra explicitly contains thirty-two letters. These are like the retinue of the principal letter, the BAM. The letter BAM consists of five letters, YA, RA, LA, WA, and short-AH, and so altogether there are thirty-seven letters. These are of one nature with the thirty-seven Dakinis. The short-AH is Vajrayogini, and the letters YA, RA, LA, and W A are Lama, Khandarohi, Rupini, and Dakini respectively. The letters OM OM OM SAR WA BU DHA DA KI NI YE VAJ RA WAR NA NI YE 160"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION VAJ RA BE RO TZA NI YE HUM HUM HUM PHAT PJHAT PHAT SO HA are the retinue of Dakinis: Partzahdi, Tzandriakiya, Par-bhawatiya, Mahanasa, Biramatiya, Karwariya, Larnkeshoriya, Drumatzaya, Airawatiya, Mahabhairawi, Bayubega, Sura-bhakiya, Shamadewi, Suwatre, Hayakarna, Khaganana, Tzatra-bega, Khandarohi, Shaundini, Tzatrawarmini, Subira, Mahabala, Tzatrawartini, Mahabire, Kakase, Ulukase, Shonase, Shukarase, Yamadhathi, Yamaduti, Yamadangtrini, and Yamamatani. THE BENEFITS OF RECITING THIS MANTRA By reciting the three-OM mantra we come closer to Vajrayogini. There are two ways to understand this. In the first sense, it is like making a connection with a special friend, and in the second sense it means actually becoming the Deity Vajrayogini. A dose retreat is a retreat in which mantra recitation and meditation on a Tantric Deity are emphasized in order to bring us closer to the Deity in both these senses. Reciting the three-OM mantra purifies our non-virtuous actions and their imprints and pacifies the obstacles that prevent success in our practice. It also increases th.e power of our speech. The speech of most ordinary beings is mundane and possesses little power, but ordinary speech can be transformed through reciting this mantra. Using mantra recitation we can pacify all inner obstacles such as sickness and strong delusions, as well as outer obstacles such as being harmed by evil spirits. Our lifespan, merit, wealth, and, most important,. our spiritual realizations will increase. We will gain control over the evil actions of others and be able to lead them into correct paths. When necessary we will be able to tame the minds of others and thereby help many sentient beings by using wrathful actions. Reciting the three-OM mantra continually with faith will cause us to experience increasing happiness and fulfil our wishes. It causes realizations of the completion stage practice of vajra recitation to ripen and, finally, it enables us to attain the vajra speech of a Buddha. The Root Tantra of Heruka praises Vajrayogini's mantra as the 'king of all mantras' and states that there is no mantra in all 161"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND the three realms of existence that is more powerful. This Tantra also explains that Vajrayogini's mantra is in essence the mantra of all Dakinis, and that just by remembering or reciting it with faith we remember or recite the mantras of all Dakinis. Je Phabongkhapa said that only with Vajrayogini's mantra is it possible to receive actual attainments merely by recitation. In the Root Tantra of Heruka, Vajradhara says: Attainments can be achieved merely by reciting the mantra, And all actions will be completed perfectly. This, the king of all mantras, Causes the completion of every action. There is no mantra more supreme than this In all the three realms. This is the essence of all Dakinis. By merely remembering this mantra All the attainments will be achieved. Here, 'attainments' refers to the temporary happiness of humans and gods and the ultimate happiness of liberation and enlightenment. It also refers to those attainments that are common to Sutra and Tantra such as renunciation, bodhichitta, and correct view, and to the uncommon attainments of Secret Mantra such as the realizations of generation stage and com-pletion stage. Besides achieving these attainments, through reciting this mahtra we will be cared for by all the Dakas and Dakinis of the Twenty-four Places and their emanations. By reciting the three-OM mantra we are reciting the essence mantra of all Dakinis. For example, when we recite this mantra we are also indirectly reciting the mantras of Tara, Sarasvati, Marichi, and of all other Dakinis. Reciting this mantra also leads to the attainment of outer and inner Dakini Land. By reciting this mantra we can help others to fulfil their wishes and gain peace, good health, long life, and prosperity. We will attain the ability to avert others' diseases such as cancer, strokes, paralysis, and all physical pain, as well as dangers from fire, water, earth. and wind. Some practitioners who have a strong karmic link with 162"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION Vajrayogini through their daily practice, or by merely reciting this mantra, attain outer Dakini Land before their death, some-times without even engaging in dose retreats or intense medi-tation. Some attain Dakini Land in the bardo by remembering, as in a dream, their daily recitation of the mantra, thereby enabling Vajrayogini to lead them to her Pure Land. In Dakini Land these practitioners are cared for by Heruka and Vajra-yogini and, without ever having to undergo uncontrolled death again, they attain enlightenment during that life. It is for these reasons that the three-OM mantra of Vajrayogini is called the 'king of all mantras'. ACTUAL MANTRA RECITATION This has two parts: 1 Verbal recitation 2 Mental recitation with two completion stage meditations Verbal recitation At the time of receiving the Vajrayogini empowerment, we make a promise to recite a certain number of three-OM mantras as a daily commitment. It is important to keep a suitable rosary, or mala, on which to count mantra recitations. The mala has great meaning and is one of the commitment ritual objects. Once we have found a suitable mala we should try to bless it every day by performing the following short blessing. We regard our left hand as being the nature of the wisdom of emptiness and our right hand as being the nature of great bliss. We place the mala in the palm of our right hand and cup our left hand over it. Joining the two hands in this way symbolizes the union of great bliss and emptiness. We then recall that the nature of the mala is empti-ness and recite the three-OM mantra three or seven times. We then blow on the mala while rubbing it between our hands and, with strong concentration, imagine that the mala transforms 163"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND into Vajrayogini's wisdom, which is the union of great bliss and emptiness. Once the mala has been blessed in this way we should always regard it as a holy object. By blessing and continuously using our mala while reciting the mantra, it will gradually become a very powerful object with which to bestow blessings and avert others' obstacles. Many Tibetans have experienced the spiritual power of the malas of pure practitioners. When they or their children are afflicted by evil spirits they go to pure practitioners who cure them by the healing action of touching the sick per-son's crown with a blessed mala and praying for their welfare. Through the power of such actions many people have received real benefit. During mantra recitation there is a special way of using the mala to gather all the Dakinis into our body and to receive their blessings. We begin by hanging the mala over the ring finger of our left hand. The mala can be held either at the level of the heart or at the level of the navel. We recite the mantra once and then move the first bead inwards, towards ourself, with the thumb. We imagine that from the emptiness of each bead there arises a Deity in the aspect of Vajrayogini who dissolves into our heart or navel. After reciting a few mantras in this way we can continue by hanging the mala over the middle. finger, or index finger if this is more comfortable, and move the mala beads with the thumb as before. However, it is an auspicious sign for our practice to use the ring finger and thumb at least a few times at the beginning of the mantra recitation session because it symbolizes controlling delusions. Tantric practitioners have a commitment to make offerings to the Buddhas and to benefit sentient beings. To fulfil these two commitments we can recite the three-OM mantra with the visu-alization described in the sadhana. At my heart inside a red phenomena-source, a double tetrahedron, in the centre of a moon mandala, is a letter BAM encircled by a red-coloured mantra rosary circling counter-clockwise. From these, immeasurable rays of red light radiate. They cleanse the negativities and obstruc-tions of all sentient beings and make offerings to all the 164"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION Buddhas. All the power and force of their blessings is invoked in the form of rays of red light which dissolve into the letter BAM and mantra rosary, blessing my mental continuum. This is the recitation of commitment. To improve our body mandala meditation we can recite the mantra with the following visualization. At the heart of the principal Deity of the body mandala th~re is a phenomena-source. Inside this, on a moon cushion, there is a. red letter BAM surrounded by the red three-OM mantra. We recite the three-OM mantra with an alert mind and, while observing the letters of the mantra, we identify each of the thirty-seven Deities of the mantra. For example, as we recite the first OM we simul-taneously try to identify Partzandi, as we recite the second OM we try to identify Tzandriakiya, and so forth, until we reach the last syllable HA when we try to identify Yamamatani. Mental recitation with two completion stage meditations This is presented in three parts: 1 First completion stage meditation 2 Mental recitation 3 Second completion stage meditation Mental recitation can be practised with either the generation stage or the completion stage meditations. Through this practice we receive benefits both from mantra recitation and completion stage meditation. First completion stage meditation To do this meditation we visualize that at our heart there is a phenomena-source about the size of the tip of a little finger. Inside this is a moon cushion, mantra rosary, and letter BAM. The phenomena-source descends through the central channel to the centre of our navel channel wheel. We concentrate on 165"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND this for a few moments. We then gently inhale and imagine that all the winds of the upper part of our body gather and descend through the central channel, reaching the point just above the phenomena-source at the navel. Then we slightly tighten the muscles of the lower part of the body and gather up all the lower winds. These rise up through the central chan-nel and reach the point just below the phenomena-source at the navel. Both the lower and upper winds of the body are now held together at the navel. This is called the 'vase breath' because the shape of the united upper and lower winds is like the shape of a bulbous vase. We should feel that our mind is inside the phenomena-source at the centre of the navel channel wheel. We then focus on the four side corners of the phenomena-source where tiny joy swirls spin counter-clockwise. We hold the vase breath and concen-trate single-pointedly on the four joy swirls for as long as poss-ible. Just before we begin to feel discomfort we exhale slowly and gently. This process can be repeated many times in one session because initially we are unable to hold our breath for very long. After we have gained some experience in this meditation we can practise actual mental recitation. Mental recitation We begin mental recitation by repeating the previous meditation up to the vase breath. Our mind then dissolves into the letter BAM and becomes one with it. Then, while we hold the vase breath inside the central channel at the navel, our mind, the letter BAM, reads the letters of the three-OM mantra counter-clockwise. We mentally recite the mantra three or seven times and then exhale gently. Then again we draw in the winds to the navel, hold them there while mentally reciting the mantra, and then exhale again. This cycle can be repeated many times in one session. 166"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION Second completion stage meditation Regular practice of the following meditation will develop and increase our experience of great bliss, improve our understand-ing of emptiness, and cause us to realize the clear light of bliss. We visualize that at the centre of our body, midway between the two shoulders but closer to the back than the front, there is the central channel. It is red in colour, smooth, and clear. It is in the nature of light and about the thickness of an arrow. From the lower tip, which is at the sex organ, it goes straight up to the crown. Then it arches downwards and ends at the point between the eyebrows. Just inside the lower tip of the central channel there is a tiny white joy swirl which spins very quickly counter-clockwise, and inside the upper tip of the central channel, between the eyebrows, there is a tiny red joy swirl also spinning very quickly counter-clockwise. We focus first on the white joy swirl inside the lower tip of the central channel. We concentrate on it spinning rapidly and imagine that it induces a strong feeling of great bliss. As it spins, the joy swirl slowly rises within the central channel, causing our experience of great bliss to intensify. When the joy swirl reaches the centre of our heart channel wheel we concentrate on it while experiencing bliss. Then we focus on the red joy swirl at the upper tip of the central channel. Spinning continuously, it rises from between the eyebrows to the centre of the crown channel wheel and then descends slowly through the central channel. When it reaches the point just above the white joy swirl at our heart we focus on both joy swirls spinning very rapidly and continuously, one above the other, and we recollect that everything is in the nature of emptiness. As the joy swirls spin, they gradually come closer to each other until finally they merge and transform into one pink joy swirl. The pink joy swirl continues to spin and gradually becomes smaller and smaller until finally it dissolves into the clear light of empti-ness. Our mind of great bliss then meditates on emptiness and we concentrate on this experience single-pointedly for as long as possible. The 'clear light of emptiness' referred to here is the experience of the clear light of bliss mixed inseparably with emptiness. 167"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND This experience is called the 'secret Dakini'. The letter BAM visualized at our navel during the empowerment and in the first completion stage meditation is called the 'inner Dakini'. The Dakinis of the Twenty-four Holy Places are called the 'outer Dakinis'. These three types of Dakini are mentioned in the extensive dedication prayer in the Vajrayogini sadhana: The beautiful Mother of the Conquerors is the outer Yogini, The letter BAM is the supreme inner Vajra Queen, The clarity and emptiness of the mind itself is the secret Dakini Mother; May I enjoy the sport of seeing the self-nature of each. EXPLANATION OF CLOSE RETREAT This has four parts: 1 What is a retreat? 2 Explanation of close retreats of signs, time, and numbers 3 Preliminary practices for close retreat 4 The actual close retreat What is a retreat? On retreat we stop all forms of business and extraneous activ-ities in order to emphasize a particular spiritual practice. There are three kinds of retreat: physical, verbal, and mental. We engage in physical retreat when, with a spiritual motivation, we isolate ourselves from other people, activities, and noise, and disengage from extraneous and meaningless actions. We engage in verbal retreat when, with a spiritual motivation, we refrain from meaningless talk and periodically remain silent. We engage in mental retreat by preventing distractions and strong delusions such as attachment, anger, and jealousy from arising, and by maintaining mindfulness and conscientiousness. If we remain in physical and verbal retreat but fail to observe mental retreat, our retreat will have little power. Such a retreat 168"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION may be relaxing, but if we do not prevent strong delusions from arising even on retreat our mind will not be at peace. However, keeping physicaL and verbal retreat will help us to keep mental retreat, and for this reason Shantideva praised the first two kinds of retreat in Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life. Explanation of close retreats of signs, time, and numbers A close retreat is a retreat in which we practise special methods that cause us to draw closer to the attainments of a Tantric Deity. We engage in a close retreat of signs when we remain in retreat until a correct sign of attainment manifests. We engage in a close retreat of time when we do a retreat for a definite period of time such as six months, or, alternatively, when we do either a long or short close retreat every year at the same time. There are two kinds of close retreat of numbers: a dose retreat of actions, and a great close retreat. There are also longer and shorter close retreats of actions. On a long clost? retreat of actions of Vajrayogini the three-OM mantra is recited four hun-dred thousand times, and on a short close retreat of actions on Vajrayogini the mantra is recited one hundred thousand times. To conclude both long and short close retreats of actions we should recite ten thousand wisdom-descending mantras and then perform a fire puja. There are also two kinds of great close retreat: extensive great close retreat, and short great close retreat. In an extensive great close retreat of Vajrayogini we recite the three-OM mantra ten million times, and in a short great close retreat we recite the mantra three million, two hundred thousand times. Preliminary practices for close retreat There are two kinds of practice that can be done as preliminaries to engaging in a successful close retreat: distant preliminaries and close preliminaries. Whether or not we achieve mundane 169"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND or supramundane results from doing a close retreat depends upon the preparations that we make. Well-made preparations will bring good results. Distant preliminaries There are nine distant preliminary practices: 1 Going for refuge 2 Vajrasattva mantra recitation 3 Prostrations 3 Mandala offerings 5 Guru yoga 6 Samayavajra mantra recitation 7 V ajradaka burning offering 8 Making images of the body or mind of a Buddha 9 Water offerings Each of these should be performed a hundred thousand times. If we are unable to do all nine preliminaries, but wish strongly to attain realizations of generation and completion stages, we should try to do at least the first five preliminaries, performing each one purely a hundred thousand times. The practices of going for refuge, Vajrasattva mantra recitation, mandala offer-ings, and Guru yoga can be done in conjunction with Je Phabongkhapa's extensive Vajrayogini sadhana. At first we may feel that these preliminaries are too great a task for us, but I, the author, would like to give encouragement by relating my own experience. I have completed four Vajra-yogini close retreats. I did my first in a group very soon after receiving the empowerment of Vajrayogini. At that time I had not completed the first five preliminaries. Later, after complet-ing the five preliminary practices, I did my second and third close retreats. Later still I completed the remaining four pre-liminaries and I did my fourth close retreat. Since then I have accomplished meditational retreats on Vajrayogini and other Yidams many times. We should not think that by completing just one or two close retreats we will become a Buddha! It is very important to gain a clear understanding of how to perform each of the nine preliminary practices. The practices of 170"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION refuge, Vajrasattva mantra recitation, Guru yoga,. and mandala offerings have been explained earlier in this book. The way to accumulate a hundred thousand Guru yogas is to recite the main practice of Guru yoga in the sadhana once at the beginning of each session and then to count the number of recitations of the brief request, or of the name mantra of our Guru, or of the mantra of Guru Vajradharma. The way to accumulate pros-trations in conjunction with the Bodhisattva's Confession of Moral Downfalls is explained in The Bodhisattva Vows. The mantra recitation of Samayavajra and the burning offer-ing of Vajradaka should be done together with their respective sadhanas. These can be found in Appendix II. The Samayavajra mantra recitation mainly purifies degenerated commitments and vows, and the burning offering of Vajradaka purifies our negative karma in general. These two practices and the Vajra-sattva mantra recitation are principally purification practices. Making prostrations is both a practice of purification and a method to accumulate merit. To perform the burning offering of Vajradaka we need black sesame seeds and a small container for the fire. The container represents the mandala of Vajradaka and serves as the visual object of the practice. The fire that is made inside the container should be smokeless and should last for at least as long as the session. The fire container is set up in front of our meditation seat. We put as many sesame seeds as are to be burned in that session on a plate and arrange the seeds in the shape of a scorpion. When everything has been prepared, we sit on the meditation seat and begin the session. We imagine that all the negative karma created by ourself and other living beings gathers into a mass of black light which dissolves into the scorpion-shaped arrangement of sesame seeds. While reciting the offering mantra we take a few sesame seeds with the thumb and ring finger of the right hand and throw them into the fire. We continue in this way until all the sesame seeds on the plate have been burned. While doing this we count the number of mantra recitations and offerings on a mala with our left hand. We should patiently follow this pro-cedure, collecting the mantra recitations and offerings each day 171"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND in several sessions, until we have completed a hundred thou-sand recitations and offerings. Je Tsongkhapa compiled instructions specifically for this prac-tice. It is a very powerful method to purify our own negative actions and it can also be used to purify the negative actions of others, whether they are alive or dead. For example, if our mother has died we can purify her negative actions by perform-ing this burning offering on her behalf. To do this, we follow the sadhana as usual except that we focus mainly on our mother, visualizing her in front of us, as if she were alive. We imagine that all the negative karma she has created since beginningless time gathers together in a mass of smoke-coloured light which dissolves into the sesame seeds. Whilst reciting the offering mantra we offer the seeds to the mouth of Vajradaka at the centre of the mandala. We then request that our mother's mental continuum be cleansed of all faults. We repeat this offer-ing and request many times. To make a hundred thousand images of a Buddha, or of a Buddha's stupa, we need an authentic mould from which to cast the images. We should try to do the casting ourself rather than paying others to do it. As each statue or stupa is produced we imagine that a new living Buddha manifests from the Dharmakaya. While making these images we recite the mantra of the essence of dependent relationship: OM YE DHARMA HETU TRABHAWA HETUN TEKAN TATAGATO HAWADA TEKANTSA YO NIRODHA EHWAMBHADHI MAHA SHRAMANIYE SOHA. With one mould we can produce many statues at the same time, so it will not take very long to make a hundred thousand. The statues or stupas can be either large or small. Even making one statue or stupa with faith creates the cause for us to become a living Buddha in the future. To make a hundred thousand water offerings, ideally we should obtain a hundred offering bowls and fill these with pure water every day. If we wish to do retreat we can do five sessions each day, offering a hundred water bowls in each session. Gradually we will collect the hundred thousand water offerings. The benefits of offering water and the way to make water offer-ings are explained in Joyful Path of Good Fortune and other books. 172"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION At first we may think that we should just do the retreat and not bother with the preliminary practices because they are too difficult. Although it is true that the nine preliminaries take a long time, it is nevertheless important to try to do them. The preliminary practices are like preparing a meal and the actual retreat is like eating the meal. Preparing a meal is more difficult than eating it, but a meal that is prepared with great care is a joy to eat. Some practitioners may think that once they have finished one retreat there is no need to do the nine or the five preliminar-ies, but this attitude is incorrect. We cannot say we have fin-ished meditation retreats until we achieve Buddhahood. After completing one close retreat and concluding with a fire puja, in subsequent close retreats we can emphasize meditation and try to gain experience of generation and completion stages. Close preliminaries The close preliminary practices are performed just before start-ing a close retreat. We need to find a quiet and peaceful place with a good, well-built retreat room in a safe and healthy enVironment. We should make certain that all necessary facil-ities such as food, water, heating, and so forth are readily available. We also need a suitable assistant to help us during our retreat. We should have the freedom to practise within our own spiritual tradition. In addition to these external conditions we need certain inner conditions. In particular we must have studied the :instructions and commentaries thoroughly so that we understand how to practise the preliminaries, the eleven yogas of generation stage, and the completion stage meditations. We should then prepare the retreat room. First we clean the room and set up a shrine with statues or paintings of Buddha Shakyamuni, Je Tsongkhapa, Vajrayogini, and our root Guru. If we have other images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas we can also place them on the shrine. We set up our meditation seat facing the shrine. The seat should, if possible, face west. It should be stable and comfortable, with a slightly raised back. Since the cushion should not be moved throughout the retreat 173"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND it is important, especially on a long retreat, that it is ventilated underneath. This can be done by raising it on a wooden plat-form with holes in. These preparations should be carried out a few days before the retreat is due to begin. On the morning of the day the retreat begins, we set up the tormas and other offerings on the shrine, placing the tormas on a slightly higher level than the other offerings. In front of these we set out four rows of offering bowls. The first row, nearest the back of the shrine, is for the supramundane Deities, the second row is for the mundane dakas and dakinis, and the third row is for the Dharma Protectors. These three rows of outer offerings are laid out starting from the statue's left, that is from our right. The fourth set of outer offerings is to the self-generation and is arranged starting from our left. Each row of offering bowls is arranged in the following order: AHRGHAM, PADAM, PUPE, DHUPE, DIWE, GANDHE and NEWIDE. There is no need to set out a shapta offering because music is not a visual object. On a small table in front of us we place our ritual objects: the bell and vajra, damaru, inner offering container, ritual vase, and rosary. The vase should be more than half-filled with fresh water mixed with saffron, and the spout of the vase should point towards us. Until the retreat is finished the meditation seat should not be moved or changed, nor should the commit-ment ritual objects be r~moved from the retreat room. Outside the retreat house we should mentally make a bound-ary around the retreat area by choosing various landmarks such as trees, roads, or mountains. These can be as near or far as we wish. When we have marked the boundary we make a strong determination not to go beyond it until we finish the retreat. At the beginning of the retreat we make a strong determina-tion not to meet people for the duration of the retreat. However, we can make exceptions for special people such as our Spiritual Guide, our assistant, our close Dharma friends, or our doctor. We should also decide to refrain from all worldly activities, mental busyness, and meaningless conversations. In short, we should make a determination to engage in a retreat of body, speech, and mind. We should also prepare two tormas for the preliminary rituals 174"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION - one, consisting of three small tormas with candles in front of them, for dispelling obstacles, and the other for the local guardians. The first torma is taken out during the preliminary rituals. The torma for the local guardians can be taken outside after these rituals are concluded. Having completed all the preparations, in the mid-afternoon of the first day of our retreat we should sit on the meditation cushion and perform the preliminary rituals. We recite the pre-liminary prayers for entering retreat-g<;>ing for refuge, gener-ating bodhichitta, instant self-generation, blessing the inner offering, accomplishing the cleansing water. of the vase, making torma offerings to the mundane dakas and dakinis, offering the torma to the local guardians, giving and sending out the obs-tacle-dispelling torma. Then we mentally generate Khandarohi at each of the boundary landmarks to avert obstacles to our retreat. At this point we meditate on the protection circle - the vajra ground, fence, tent, and canopy, surrounded by the five-coloured wisdom fires. We strongly imagine that we are inside this protection circle. The meditation cushion is then blessed and we once again meditate on the protection circle. We then bless our meditation environment and everything within it, and we bless our three bodily places. Then once again we meditate on the protection circle. All of these preliminary rituals should be performed in conjunction with the retreat preliminaries sad-hana composed by Je Phabongkhapa, which can be found in Appendix II. We should try to finish these preparations in good time so that we can take a break to relax and have supper before sunset. The first session of the actual retreat should start at dusk. The actual close retreat We begin the first session of the retreat by generating an especially pure motivation. We think: Through the kindness of Buddha Shakyamuni, and especially through the kindness of my precious root Guru, I now have the 175"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND great fortune and opportunity to practise the supreme path of Vajrayogini. I must use this opportunity to benefit all living beings. With a feeling of great happiness we then recite the sadhana, concentrating on the meaning of the words without being dis-tracted. After the Prayer to Behold the Beautiful Face of Vajrayogini we make the tsog offerings and then continue with the remain-ing prayers of the sadhana, concluding with the long dedication prayers and the auspicious prayers. When we go to bed we should remember to practise the yoga of sleeping. On the next day, the first session should be finished before breakfast, the second session before lunch, the third session before supper, and the last session before going to bed. This, or a similar timetable, should be maintained every day for the duration of the retreat. During the meditation breaks we should improve our renunciation, compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness by studying and contemplating Lamrim instructions, and also improve our understanding of the genera-tion and completion stages by reading Tantric commentaries. In each session, after blessing the inner offering, we take one drop of nectar with the tip of the left ring finger and, with it, draw a triangle on the palm of the right hand. We imagine that this nectar is made of the white and red bodhichittas of Father Heruka and Mother Vajrayogini that came from the Mother's sex organ. We taste the nectar and imagine that our channels, drops, and inner winds are blessed and purified of all faults, and we experience the clear light of bliss. By going for refuge we increase our renunciation and com-passion, through meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva we purify our negative karma, by practising Guru yoga we collect a vast accumulation of merit, by meditating on bringing the three bodies into the spiritual path we ·purify and gain control over death, intermediate state, and rebirth, and through the actual meditation on generation and completion stages we purify ordinary appearance and ordinary conception. Through these practices and through reciting the three-OM mantra, moment by moment we draw closer and closer to Vajrayogini and all the Dakinis. By offering tormas we will quickly receive 176"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE YOGA OF VERBAL AND MENTAL RECITATION attainments from Vajrayogini, and by making tsog offerings we fulfil our commitments and so will be cared for by the Heroes and Heroines. During the retreat we should often think about these benefits. It is very important to keep the commitments of retreat, namely, not to meet many people, not to engage in meaningless conversations, to maintain mindfulness and conscientiousness, not to engage in worldly activities, not to read books that are unrelated to our main practice, to make torma offerings each day at the same time, not to argue with others, not to show our commitment ritual objects to those with no faith, to be careful not to damage tormas, and not to allow those without faith to touch our mala. We should also try to abandon the ten faults of verbal recitation - breaking the recitation by talking or by coughing, or reciting the mantra too loudly, without any sound, too quickly, too slowly, with sighs, while hiccupping, with a sleepy mind, or with a distracted mind. When we do a close retreat of actions the full number of mantras should be recited on the same cushion. After complet-ing either one hundred thousand or four hundred thousand recitations of the three-OM mantra, we recite the wisdom-descending mantra ten thousand times: OM OM OM ~ARWA BUDDHA DAKINIYE. V AJRA WARNANIYE V AJRA BEROTZANIYE HUM HUM HUM PHAT PHAT PHAT HUM HA ADZE SOHA. While reciting this mantra we visualize countless rays of red light radiating from our heart to the ten directions and inviting all the Buddhas in the form of Vajrayogini. These dissolve into our body like a heavy shower of rain falling into an ocean. With strong conviction we think that we have received the blessings of all the Buddhas and we imagine that our mind and body transform into the nature of omniscient wisdom. After complet-ing ten thousand wisdom-descending mantras, we do the last session of our retreat in the morning of the last day. In this session we should recite the whole sadhana, including the tsog offering, exactly as we did in the first session of the retreat. After we have finished the retreat; we can take out the tormas and other offerings and put them in a high place, or into the sea or a river, or in any clean and pure place. Until we complete the fire puja, we should continue to recite once a day the whole 177"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN!

More information on the preparations for the fire puja and on the design of the hearth can be found by consulting the sadhana and the diagram in Appendix III. When we come to perform the actual fire puja we shall require the help of several assistants. 178"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Yoga of Inconceivability and the Yoga of Daily Actions THE YOGA OF INCONCEIVABILITY Training in this meditation will improve our experience of both the common and uncommon aspects of the two truths. The common aspect of the two truths is that which is taught in Sutra teachings and the uncommon aspect is meaning clear light and the pure illusory body. All the appearances of this life, our environment, enjoyments, body, and mind, arose from the clear light of death of the previous life. Immediately after that clear light of de;:lth ceased we perceived the appearance of black-near-attainment of reverse order, which was the first moment of the mind of this life. From this mind, all the gross minds that perceive the things of this life gradually developed and we came to experience various pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings. Later, when we die, all our gross minds that perceive the things of this world will dissolve back into the clear light of <;ieath and at the same time everything that appears to us now will vanish. Similarly, when we meditate on bringing death into the path of the Truth Body we imagine that all ordinary appearances dissolve into the dear light of death and that from this mind the gross minds that perceive the pure environment, enjoy-ments, body, and mind of Vajrayogini gradually develop. Then, in the yoga of inconceivability, these minds dissolve back into the clear light of emptiness. Everything we perceive during generation stage meditation disappears and we once again experience only the dear light of emptiness.

They exist only as mere appearances to the mind. The actual practice of this yoga is done by following the sadhana. We visualize as follows: From the letter BAM and the mantra rosary at my heart, light rays radiate and pervade all three realms. The form-less realm dissolves into the upper part of my body in the aspect of rays of blue light. The form realm dissolves into the middle part of my body in the aspect of rays of red light. The desire realm dissolves into the lower part of my body in the aspect of rays of white light. I, in tum, gradually melt into light from below and above and dissolve into the phenomena-source. That dissolves into the moon. That dissolves into the thirty-two Yoginis. They dissolve into the four Yoginis, and they dissolve into the Principal Lady of the body mandala. The Prin-cipal Lady, in tum, gradually melts into light from below and above and dissolves into the phenomena-source. That dissolves into the moon. That dissolves into the mantra rosary. That dissolves into the letter BAM. That dissolves into the head of the BAM. That dissolves into the crescent moon. That dissolves into the drop. That dissolves into the nada, and that, becoming smaller and smaller, dis-solves into clear light emptiness. Having dissolved everything into clear light emptiness, we imagine that we experience the clear light of bliss mixed indivis-ibly with emptiness and we meditate on this for as long as possible. The real inconceivability is the union of the clear light of bliss and emptiness. Only qualified Tantric practitioners can experience this. The yoga of inconceivability is principally a method for training in this union, and for attaining meaning clear light and the pure illusory body. The meditation given here is the common practice of the yoga of inconceivability, which can be practised by all practitioners of Vajrayogini. There is also an uncommon practice of the yoga of inconceivability which can be practised only by Vajrayogini practitioners who have received special instructions. 181"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND THE YOGA OF DAILY ACTIONS The yoga of daily actions is a method for transforming everyday actions such as eating, sleeping, walking, and talking into pro-found spiritual paths, thereby extracting great meaning from every moment of our life. The yoga of daily actions has two parts: 1 The main practice 2 The branch practices The main practice With the feeling of great bliss experienced at the time of meditat-ing on the yoga of inconceivability, instantaneously we arise from the state of emptiness as Vajrayogini. We are surrounded by the outer protection circle and wear the inner protection circle of armour marked on our body. We now generate the directional protection circle of the wrathful Dakinis of the ten directions by reciting the wrathful mantra called the 'mantra emanating from the four mouths' while snapping the thumb and index finger of our left hand in each of the ten directions. We imagine that ten wrathful Dakinis emanate from the letter BAM at our heart. In the east, that is, in front of us, is Kakase, in the north Ulukase, in the west Shonase, in the south Shuka-rase, in the south-east Yamadhathi, in the south-west Yamaduti, in the north-west Yamadangtrini, and in the north-east Yama-matani. In the space above is Kakase, and in the space below is Khandarohi. We visualize all these Deities in the aspect of Vajrayogini, but with wrathful expressions. Powerful flames of wisdom fire emanate from their bodies and pervade the direc-tion they guard, protecting practitioners from harmful spirits. First we recite OM SUMBHANI SUMBHA HUM HUM PHAT, exhorting the Deity in the east and the Deity in the space above, both of whom are called Kakase, to drive away all evil spirits from these directions. As we recite this mantra we snap the left thumb and index finger twice, first in front of us, and then a little above us. Snapping our fingers reminds us that everything 182"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAII.Y ACTIONS is in the nature of emptiness. Then with the recitation of OM GRIHANA GRIHANA HUM HUM PHAT, we exhort Ulukase to dispel all evil spirits from the north and we snap our fingers once to the north and recall emptiness. With OM GRIHANA PAYA GRIHANA PAYA HUM HUM PHAT, we exhort Shonase in the west and Khandarohi in the space below to drive away the evil spirits from those directions, and we snap our fingers twice, first behind our head and then behind our neck. With OM ANAYA HO BHAGAWAN VAJRA HUM HUM PHAT, we exhort Shukarase to avert the evil spirits in the south, and we snap our fingers once to the south and recall emptiness. Then we recite the four mantras once again. With the recita-tion of the first mantra we exhort Yamadhati to drive away all the evil spirits from the south-east and we snap our fingers once to the south-east and recall emptiness. With the second mantra we exhort Yamaduti to drive away the ,evil spirits from the south-west and we snap our fingers once to the south-west and recall emptiness. With the third mantra we exhort Yamadangtrini to drive away all the evil spirits from the north-west, and we snap our fingers once to the north-west and recall emptiness. With the fourth mantra we exhort Yamamatani to drive away the evil spirits from the north-east and we snap our fingers once to the north-east and remember that everything is the nature of emptiness. These mantras are called the 'mantra emanating from the four mouths' because the sound of these four mantras comes from the mouths of four-faced Heruka. These mantras possess special power that can avert all obstacles. Having set up this directional protection circle, we should maintain the following recognitions throughout our daily activ-ities: whatever appears to our mind is the nature of emptiness, all emptinesses have the nature of great bliss, and all experi-ences of great bliss are in nature one with Vajrayogini. We should try to combine all our daily actions with these three recognitions. Those who can do this practice successfully can transform their everyday actions into acts of great virtue, even though others may think that their actions are neutral, or even evil. Through gaining experience in the correct view of empti-ness we will be able to practise the first recognition. Through 183"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND gaining experience in bringing the three bodies into the path, and through gaining experience of the tenth and eleventh yogas, we will be able to practise the last two recognitions. The branch practices There are six branch practices: 1 The yoga of eating 2 The tsog offering 3 Burning 'offerings 4 Offerings of the tenth days 5 Torma offerings 6 Actions of the left The yoga of eating Buddha gave many instructions on how Dharma practitioners should eat. According to Hinayana teachings we should regard food and drink as medicine for curing the pain of hunger and thirst, and eat and drink without attachment. Sutra Mahayana teachings advise us first to cultivate a bodhichitta motivation and then to think: 'My main wish is to help all living beings but to do this I first need to attain Buddhahood. The human body I now have is essential for fulfilling this wish. Therefore I must take care of it by eating and drinking'. With this motiva-tion we then enjoy our food and drink. According to the Vajra-yana teachings, in addition to the bodhichitta motivation, we should enjoy every action involving the senses, such as eating and drinking, wearing clothes, washing, singing and dancing, watching television, or listening to music, as an offering to ourself generated as a Deity, the synthesis of all Buddhas. With strong conviction in the truth of Vajradhara's words we should recall the two lines from the Root Tantra of Heruka: Making offerings to oneself Becomes an offering to all Buddhas. As Vajrayogini practitioners, when we are about to eat or 184"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS drink, we should first bless the food or drink by reciting three times the mantra OM AH HUM HA HO HRIH. OM clears away obstacles; AH purifies the defects of smell, taste,. and colour; HUM generates the substances, the five meats and five nectars; and HA HO HRIH transform the substances into nectar. Then, recalling the thirty-seven Dakinis of the body mandala at our heart, we recite the mantra PHAIM to invite all Buddhas in the aspect of Vajrayogini. We then recite DZA HUM BAM HO, and as we do so we imagine that the wisdom beings arrive, dissolve into the Dakinis of the body mandala, and mix inseparably with them. Then we enjoy the food or drink, regarding it as an offering to the thirty-seven Dakinis and thereby dt>lighting all the Buddhas. We should try to memorize the following prayer so that we can recite it before we eat or drink: OM: With a nature inseparable from the three vajras I generate as the Guru-Deity. AH: This nectar of uncontaminated exalted wisdom and bliss, HUM: Without stirring from bodhichitta I partake to delight the Deities dwelling in my body. AH HO MAHA SUKHA HO. Here, 'the three vajras' are the vajra body, vajra speech, and vajra mind of all Buddhas. The tsog offering For practitioners of Highest Yoga Tantra in general, and of Heruka and Vajrayogini in particular, the tsog offering is very important for renewing commitments and averting obstacles. It is a special method through which we come under the care and guidance of the Dakas and Dakinis who bestow completion stage realizations. Our wealth, merit, and great bliss will increase through this practice. A 'tsog' is an assembly of Heroes and Heroines. The terms 'Hero and Heroine' and 'Daka and Dakini' are inh~rchangeable. Shantideva says that a real Hero or Heroine is someone who has destroyed his or her self-cherishing mind, has conquered their delusions, and has developed the courage to help many 185"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND sentient beings. When we make a tsog offering we should regard both those to whom the offering is made and those who are making the offering as Heroes and Heroines. We offer the tsog to the Field for Accumulating Merit, which includes the entire assembly of Heroes and Heroines. When we gather together in a group to make a tsog offering puja it is very important that we regard each other as an assembly of Heroes and Heroines. If we do this puja alone we should visualize ourself surrounded by all sentient beings in the aspect of Heroes and Heroines. The substances of a tsog offering can be any pure food and drink such as cakes, chocolate, fruit, honey, biscuits, fruit juice, or yogurt. A true tsog offering must also include meat and alcohol, usually referred to by the Sanskrit terms 'bala' and 'madana' respectively, but if these are unavailable we can use something else to represent them. If we wish, we can make a tsog torma in the shape of a Heroine's breast. Traditionally this torma is col()ured red and decorated with a wheel, half moon, drop, and nada. All these substances are the basis of the tsog offering. When we make tsog offering to Vajrayogini we visualize in the space in front of us the protection circle, charnel grounds, and phenomena-source. At the centre of the phenomena-source stands Vajrayogini surrounded by the four Dakinis, the thirty-two Dakinis, all the Yidams of the four classes of Tantra, all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and all Emanation Solitary Con-querors and Hearers. In the space above these and a little behind Vajrayogini we visualize the assembly of Gurus. In the front corner of the phenomena-source we visualize supran•und-ane Heroes and Heroines and in the back corner we visualize the Dharma Protectors. Between the charnel grounds and the vajra fence we visualize countless sentient beings in the aspect of Vajrayogini. We should hold strong divine pride that we are really Vajrayogini, that our environment is the real Pure Dakini Land, and that all the beings we see in front of us are emana-tions of Vajrayogini. First we bless the tsog offering according to the sadhana. Then we recite the tsog offering prayers from the sadhana, making the offerings in the following order: to the assembly of 186"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS Gurus to receive their blessings, to the assembly of Vajrayoginis for the attainment of outer and inner Pure Dakini Lands, to the assembly of other Yidams for general Tantric attainments, to the assembly of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Solitary Conquerors, and Hearers for the attainment of general Dharma realizations, to the assembly of Dharma Protectors, Heroes, and Heroines, to avert obstacles and to gain their assistance in developing great bliss, and to all sentient beings so that they can attain liberation from ignorance and suffering. As we recite the verses we emanate countless Rasavajra goddesses from the letter BAM at our heart and imagine that they serve all the guests of the tsog offering. Then we offer outer offerings, inner offerings, and the eight lines of praise. If the Vajra Master is present on the throne it: is traditional to offer him the first portion of the nectar-food of tsog by making up a separate plate of blessed food. One, two, or three disciples, depending how elaborate is the offering, make three prostrations to the Vajra Master. If there are two disciples, one should hold the plate containing the first portion and the other should hold the bala and madana. Both should stand respect-fully facing the Vajra Master. These two disciples begin to chant the first line of the first verse of Offering the tsog to the Vajra Master, after which the assembled disciples join in. The Vajra Master begins the chanting of the second verse, and the dis-ciples join in. The representative disciples begin the third verse, and the Vajra Master begins the fourth verse. With the recitation of the mantra AH HO MAHA SUKHA HO, which means '0 great bliss!', the Vajra Master accepts the first portion of the nectar-food of tsog, the bala, and the madana, and the remairi.ing blessed food is then distributed to those present to enjoy with the yoga of eating. Then the whole assembly together with the Vajra Master chant the Song of the Spring Queen to generate and increase great bliss. This prayer, which was composed by Je Tsongkhapa, is a very blessed vajra song that expresses the profound essence of Highest Yoga Tantra. It was offered to Je Tsongkhapa by a host of Dakinis when he was living in Ganden Yangpa Chen. There are several commentaries to this song, such as those by Gungthang Tenpei Dronme and Kachen Yeshe Gyaltsan. 187"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND After sharing out· the tsog offering substances, one disciple should collect a piece of blessed food from each disciple and, last of all, from the Vajra Master. To this plate is added some offering substances which were not distributed, and some bala and madana. If the offering is made at night we should also put a stick of burning incense on the plate. This offering is then blessed with the prayer from the sadhana, and is given to the spirits who live on left-over food that has been dedicated to them by humans. It is very important for practitioners of Vajrayogini and Heruka to make tsog offerings because it is a principal method to attain both outer and inner Pure Dakini Land. Khadrubje received a vision of Heruka in which Heruka said to him, 'Prac-titioners who sincerely practise tsog offering without missing the two 'tenth' days of each month will definitely be reborn in Pure Dakini Land'. We should therefore make sure that we do not miss tsog offerings on these two days, ten days after new moon, and t.en days after full moon, which are the tenth and the twenty-fifth days of the month according to the Tibetan calendar. Burning offerings The real burning offerings that delight the Gurus and Buddhas are the mental practices that consume the fuel of ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions. In generation stage lT\\editation we develop the 'fire' of concentration on clear appearance and divine pride which partially consumes the fuel of ordinary appearance and ordinary conception. Then, during completion stage meditation, we develop the 'fire' of the wis-dom of the union of spontaneous great bliss and emptiness which totally consumes the fuel of ordinary appearance and ordinary conception. The scriptures mention three kinds of burning offering: outer, inner, and unsurpassed. Burning offering practices that involve the use of an external fire and material substances are called outer burning offerings. There are many different kinds of outer burning offering such as the burning offering of black sesame seeds, the burning offering fulfilling the commitment of close 188"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS retreat, the burning offering of ten per cent of close retreat, and the burning offerings to achieve pacifying, increasing, control-ling, and wrathful actions. The Vajradaka fire puja and the burning offering of the candle-flame are both examples of offerings in which only black sesame seeds are burned. The latter was compiled by Je Phabongkhapa to be practised in conjunction with Vajrayogini practice. To complete a close retreat of action we need to do the burn-ing offering of fulfilling the commitment of close retreat in order to purify any mistakes we may have made during our retreat. We may have recited the mantra incorrectly, developed doubt or lack of faith, succumbed to distractions, or fallen asleep. We may have mispronounced words or omitted or added extra words while reciting the sadhana. It is possible that we practised with a bad motivation, deluded doubt, wrong views, lack of conviction, or without separating our mind from worldly activ-ities. We may have allowed our mindfulness to slacken, engaged in conversation without good reason, developed anger, jealousy, or other strong delusions, or we may have ignored or forgotten our Guru's instructions. All such mistakes can be purified by performing the fire puja. To perform the burning offering of fulfilling the commitment we should first obtain and prepare the traditional substances and make a suitably-sized fire place. We then clean and purify the area where the fire puja is to take place and make the necessary arrangements such as drawing the mandala on the fire place, arranging the fire wood, laying out the substances in the correct order, setting up the seating arrangements, and so forth. Once we are seated at the fire puja site we pick up our vajra and belt which we should hold throughout the puja, and we stop speaking. We then imagine that a wisdom-fire arises from emptiness. In the centre of the fire we visualize Vajrayogini and mundane Fire Deity and, while reciting the appropriate prayers from the fire puja sadhana, we offer to them twelve main sub-stances, a special mixture of substances, outer offerings, inner offerings, and torma offerings. We should regard all these sub-stances as having the nature of wisdom-nectar. 189"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND Each of the twelve substances has a particular significance. Offering milk wood, that is wood that still contains sap, increases our vitality, offering butter increases our wealth, offer-ing sesame seeds purifies our negative karma, offering couch grass increases our lifespan, offering rice increases our merit, offering wholemeal flour mixed with yoghurt increases supreme bliss, offering kusha grass cleanses the mind, offering mustard seeds averts outer obstacles, offering barley with its husk increases harvests, offering barley without its husk causes the development of a powerful and quick mind, offering green peas increases the power of the body, and offering wheat alleviates and controls diseases. The thirteenth offering is a special mix-ture of twelve substances. It is comprised of kusha grass, milk, barley, sesame seed, couch grass, rice, flour and yoghurt, san-dalwood powder, ti yang ku (a type of grass), thang chu (a special gum), flowers, and dried, puffed rice. The burning offering of ten per cent of close retreat is per-formed after completing a great close retreat in which we have recited ten million three-OM mantras. During this puja, which is performed over a number of days, we recite an additional one million mantras, a tenth of the tptal mantra count, and we make the same number of burning offerings. We can also do this after retreats of a hundred thousand mantras, four hundred thousand mantras, or1three million and two hundred thousand mantras. In each case, if we wish, we may perform over a number of days a fire puja in which we recite additional mantras equal to one tenth of the total mantra commitment of the retreat. Once we have accomplished a close retreat of actions and the concluding fire puja, we are permitted to perform four types of burning offering: burning offerings of pacifying actions, to pacify obstacles for ourself and others; burning offerings of increasing actions, to increase wealth, lifespan, merit, good fortune, and realizations; burning offerings of controlling actions, to gather and draw in the power of the Buddhas, Bodhi-sattvas, sentient beings, and the four elements; and burning offerings of wrathful actions, through which we can destroy the power of evil spirits. When we perform a fire puja we offer the twelve substances and other material offerings to the Deities, and at the same time 190"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS we think that our own and others' ordinary appearances and conceptions are consumed in the fire of wisdom. By thinking like this, our fire puja will be a genuine burning offering prac-tice. Any generation stage burning offering that does not involve the use of an external fire is called an inner burning offering. Any completion stage burning offering is an unsurpassed burn-ing offering. We can practise both these burning offerings when we practise the yogas of eating and drinking. vVhenever we eat or drink we focus on the letter BAM at our heart and imagine making offerings to all the Dakas and Dakinis. To make such offerings we first generate the divine pride of being Vajrayogini and imagine that the thirty-seven Dakinis of the body mandala dissolve and transform into the red letter BAM at our heart. The nada of the BAM then flares up and becomes a blazing wisdom fire which completely burns up our food and drink as we con-sume it. While we visualize this, we believe that our ordinary appearance and conception is totally consumed by the wisdom fire and this causes us to experience the unified wisdom of great bliss and emptiness. This practice is a cause of a healthy body with fewer physical disorders. It also increases our accumu-lations of both merit and wisdom. Offerings of the tenth days The first tenth day is the tenth day after the first. day of the waxing moon, and the second tenth day is the tenth day after the first day of the waning moon. Although, in the Tibetan calendar, the second tenth day is generally regarded as the twenty-fifth day of the month, from this explanation we can understand why each month is said to have two tenth days. When special offerings are made on either of these days it is called 'an offering of the tenth day'. Because these two days are sacred to the Dakinis, if we make offerings or prayers on these days it is especially powerful, and it is easier to peceive the blessings of the Dakas and Dakinis. For these reasons sincere practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini shou:td not forget to make offerings on the two tenth days. According to the practice of Vajrayogini there are three kinds of offering of the tenth day: 191"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND 1 Extensive offerings of the tenth days 2 Middling offerings of the tenth days 3 Brief offerings of the tenth days EXTENSIVE OFFERINGS OF THE TENTH DAYS This has two parts: 1 The preparation$ 2 The actual offering The preparations On a large, high table that is in front of the shrine, or in any position that is practical, we place a clean cloth. On this we place horizontally a picture of Vajrayogini's mandala. In the centre of the mandala we put a small container of sindhura powder. This is called the 'heap mandala of body'. It is the visual object upon which we generate the body of the in-front-generated Vajrayogini. Over this we arrange a tripod on which we place a real or artificial skullcup, or a similar vessel. We pour some alcohol into the skullcup, stir in a little honey, and, if possible, add a nectar pill. Then we cover the vessel with a small, clean red cloth. This is called the 'nectar mandala of speech'. It is the visual object upon which we gener-ate the speech of Vajrayogini. On top of this cloth we place the sindhura mandala of mind, the visual object upon which we generate the mind of the in-front-generated Vajrayogini. If we do not have a traditional wood block sindhura mandala we can use a clean, circular piece of wood, or a round mirror. On the flat surface we paint a red phenomena-source, shaped like a six-pointed star formed by two interlocking triangles, with joy swirls in the four side corners. In the centre of the phenomena-source we write in gold, preferably with real gold paint, the letter BAM with the three-OM mantra encircling it counter-clock-wise. Then we sprinkle a little sindhura powder through a small si,eve onto the surface of the disc, covering it lightly. We can then use this as the sindhura mandala of mind, and place it on top of the nectar mandala of speech. This method of making the sindhura mandala of mind was explained by Ngulchu Dharmabhadra in accordance with authentic tradition. · Around the mandalas of body, speech, and mind we arrange 192"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS counter-clockwise a set of small offering bowls. Starti~g in the east, in front of the mandala, we place AHRGHAM, in the north-east (to our right) P ADAM, in the north PUPE, in the north-west DHUPE, in the west DIWE, in the south-west GANDHE, in the south NEWIDE, and finally, in the south-east a flower to mark the border. In front of these we arrange a minimum of five sets of outer offerings. The first set, closest to the mandala, begins from the mandala's left (our right), and consists of nine bowls containing in order: AHRGHAM, P ADAM, ANTZAMANAM (water for rinsing the mouth), PROKYANAM (watt~r for sprink-ling), PUPE, DHUPE, DIWE, GANDHE, and NEWIDE. This is the offering to the Deities of the in-front-generated mandala. The second set, laid out in front of the first set and in the same direction, are the general outer offerings: AHRGHAM, P ADAM, PUPE, DHUPE, DIWE, GANDHE, and NEWIDE. These can be used at any stage in the sadhana such as for torma offerings, tsog offerings, or thanking offerings. In front of this row ~here are the outer offerings to the Deity of the vase, from AHRGHAM to NEWIDE, set out from the mandala's left. In front of these there are the preliminary offerings, arranged from the mandala's left, from AHRGHAM to NEWIDE. The front set of offerings, from AHRGHAM to NEWIDE, is for the self-generation. These offer-ings are arranged in the opposite direction, from our left to our right. We then place the torma offerings on the mandala's right side (on our left), slightly to the front. The tsog offerings are arranged to the left of the mandala, or wherever there is room, and the preliminary torma is placed in any suitable place. In front of our own seat, on a small table, we place a vase or vessel half filled with saffron water and add a pinch of the special substance of the vase, known in Tibetan as 'bum dza', if it is available. We place on the table a small conch shell and a miniature vajra that has a long thread of five colours wound around it, together with our bell and vajra, damaru, inner offer-ing container, and some rice or a flower head. In a group practice, only one vase, conch shell, and small vajra are neces-sary for the whole group. The actual offering The extensive offerings of the tenth day are made in conjunction with the Vajrayogini self-initiation 193"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND sadhana which can be found in Appendix II. The sequence of the sadhana is as follows: self-generation, the accomplishment of the vase, the accomplishment of the in-front mandala, making offerings, receiving empowerments, offering the tormas, offering the tsog, making the thanking offering, making the dedication, and reciting auspicious prayers. If Vajrayogini practitioners who have not yet completed a close retreat of action of Vajrayogini wish to do the extensive offering of the tenth day they should make the same preparations, but when they recite the sadhana they should omit the sections on pre-liminary torma offerings and the accomplishment of the vase, and then continue from accomplishing the in-front mandala and making extensive offerings, up to receiving empower-ments. They should then omit the section on receiving the empowerments, and continue from the torma offerings and tsog offerings to the end of the sadhana. MIDDLING OFFERINGS OF THE TENTH DAYS The middling offering of the tenth days is made by reciting the extensive self-generation sadhana of Vajrayogini together with the tsog offering prayers. BRIEF OFFERINGS OF THE TENTH DAYS The brief offering of the tenth days is made by reciting the condensed sadhana of Vajrayogini together with the tsog offer-ing prayers. Since the offerings of the tenth days is an important commit-ment for practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini, we should try not to miss them. When we make tsog offerings in conjunc-tion with the Lama Chapa puja as a tenth-day offering, we should regard the principal Field for Accumulating Merit, Lama Losang Tubwang Dorjechang, as having the same nature as Heruka and Vajrayogini. Whenever we perform a tsog offering related to any other Deity, we should regard the principal object of the Field for Accumulating Merit as being one in nature with Heruka and Vajrayogini. 194"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS If circumstances prevent us from making a tenth-day offering we can offer sweets or chocolate to three or seven young girls, regarding them as Vajrayogini. Alternatively we can recite twice the number of our usual daily commitment of the three-OM mantra. If we ignore or completely forget to make a tenth-day offering we break our commitment. Each year there is one month, known in Tibetan as 'gyal da', which is a very important time for practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini. This month, which lasts from the sixteenth day of the eleventh month of the Tibetan calendar to the fifteenth day of the twelfth month, is a powerful time for practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini to make offerings and to do retreat. The two tenth days within this month are particularly special. The first, which is the twenty-fifth day of the eleventh month, is a special day of Vajrayogini, and the second, which is the tenth day of the twelfth month, is a special day of Heruka. It is particularly important to make special offerings on these two days. Torma offerings A torma offering is a special offering of food made in order to gain spiritual attainments. Whereas tsog offerings can be made only by practitioners of Highest Yoga Tantra, torma offerings can be made by any practitioner of Sutra or Tantra. The Vinaya Sutras teach that monks should offer tormas to the Three Jewels and to the Dharmapalas in order to avert obstacles and gather all necessary conditions, and that they should give tormas to the local guardians as a way of making friends with them. A similar practice is explained in the Mind Training teachings. The torma offering in the practice of Vajrayogini is explained in two parts: 1 The preparations 2 The actual torma offering THE PREPARATIONS Generally, for the practice of Vajrayogini, there are four tormas: the three principal tormas and the Ogminma torma. However, 195"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND according to this tradition, if we wish to offer tormas continu-ally, as part of our daily practice or during close retreat, we can set up five tormas. These tormas are usually coloured red and are decorated. If we wish, we can make them in the traditional manner as illustrated in Appendix III. If we cannot make tormas in the traditional Tibetan way, we can use honey, fresh cakes, alcohol, or any other pure food to represent them. The tormas are set up on the shrine in front of a statue or picture of Vajrayogini. The central torma is for Vajrayogini and her retinue, who are the main guests of the torma offering. The torma immediately to its right (to our left) is for the mundane dakas and dakinis, and to the right of this there is a torma for the general Dharma Protectors, usually called the 'Ogminma torma'. Ogmin, or 'Akanishta' in Sanskrit, is a Buddha's Pure Land. The torma immediately to the left of the central torma (to our right) is for the Kinkara Dharma Protectors. These Pro-tectors are special Protectors for practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini. ·They are also known as 'Father Mother Lord of the Charnel Grounds'. To the left of this torma there is a torma for the Dharma Protector, called the 'great Protector of the Guru's words'. In the sadhana, the prayer for offering tormas to the general Dharma Protectors, usually referred to by its Tibetan name 'Ogminma', contains these two lines: I request you, I make offerings to you, 0 host of Protectors of the Conqueror's doctrine, I propitiate you and rely on you, 0 great Protectors of the Guru's words. The first line refers to Dharma Protectors in general and the second line refers specifically to our own Guru's Dharma Protec-tor. We should find out the name of this special Dharma Protec-tor by asking our main Guru who guides us along Vajrayogini's path. I, the author, have Dorje Shugdan as my special Dharma Protector. For me, Dorje Shugdan is the great Protector of the Guru's words and I use the fifth torma as an offering to him. The following special verse for offering the torma to Dorje Shug-dan can be added to the prayers immediately after the verse to the Kinkara Protectors: 196"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABII.ITY AND DAILY ACTIONS From the supreme places such as Tushita, Keajra, and so forth, Great Protector of the doctrine of the second Conqueror, Dorje Shugdan, five lineages, together with your retinues, Come here please and partake of this offering and torma. THE ACTUAL TORMA OFFERING The visualization of the guests to whom the tormas are offered is exactly the same as the visualization for making the tsog offering and for making the offerings of the tenth days. The tormas are blessed according to the sadhana and then we em-anate countless Rasavajra goddesses from the letter BAM at our heart to offer tormas to the guests. While visualizing the tormas being offered we recite the mantra OM V AJRA AH RA LI HO: DZA HUM BAM HO: V AJRA DAKIN! SAMAYA TON TRISHAYA HO three times and per-form the accompanying hand gesture. To make this gesture, we hold up both our hands in front of us with the flattened palms facing upwards and the thumbs tucked in. When we recite DZA HUM BAM HO, we snap the fingers of the right hand. With the first recitation we make torma offerings to Guru Vajrayogini and her retinue of thirty-six Dakinis as well as to the lineage Gurus. With the second recitation we make torma offerings to all the other Yidams, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Solit-ary Conquerors, and Hearers. With the third recitation we make torma offerings to all Dharma Protectors and supramundane Dakas and Dakinis. The meaning of the offering mantra is as follows: OM: 0 Vajrayogini V AJRA: refers to the torma itself AH RA LI HO: please enjoy DZA: we imagine the nectar reaches Vajrayogini's tongue HUM: the nectar reaches her throat BAM: it reaches her heart HO: Vajrayogini experiences spontaneous great bliss V AJRA DAKJNI: 0 Vajrayogini 197"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND SAMAYA TON: through your compassionate equanimity TRISHAYA HO: please care for me. We then recite twice the mantra which begins OM KHA KHA, KHAHI KHAHI, SARWA YAKYA RAKYASA .... With the first recitation we offer tormas to the mundane dakas and dakinis of the four principal directions, and with the second recitation we offer tormas to the mundane dakas and dakinis of the four intermediate directions. When we recite this mantra we call upon the mundane dakas and dakinis, the eleven assemblies such as the assembly of gods, the assembly of nagas, and so forth who reside in the eight charnel grounds, to accept the torma and enjoy it, and to assi~t us in fulfilling our wishes. After offering these tormas, we then make outer and inner offerings and recite the long and short prayers to Vajrayogini, requesting her to lead us and all sentient beings to her Pure Land. We then offer the torma to the general Dharma Protectors such as four-faced Mahakala, Kalindevi (Palden Lhamo), and the Kinkara Protectors, as well as the special torma to the great Protector of the Guru's words. For these offerings we use the prayer from the sadhana called 'Ogminma' in Tibetan. At the conclusion of the sadhana, we recite the Vajrasattva mantra while ringing the bell to recall emptiness. This purifies any mistakes we may have made during our practice. We ask the holy beings to be patient and to forgive any mistakes. We then recite the dedication prayers and auspicious verses. Actions of the left In the Root Tantra of Heruka, Vajradhara says: All migrators and the unmoving three realms Arise from the left. Here, 'the left' is the clear light of emptiness. This passage means that everything within the three realms, including all sentient beings, arises from emptiness. Mother Tantra in gen-eral, and Vajrayogini and Heruka Tantras in particular, princip-ally reveal the practice of the clear light of emptiness, that is, a 198"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE YOGAS OF INCONCEIVABILITY AND DAILY ACTIONS mind of clear light conjoined with a realization of emptiness. Practitioners of Heruka and Vajrayogini should treasure the clear light of emptiness as their heart practice. To constantly remind ourselves of this, we should try to begin all physical actions from the left. For example, when we are about to touch something or pick up an object we should use our left hand. Whenever we look at something, we should try to think that we are looking at it first with our left eye. When we listen to something, we should try to think that we are hearing it first with our left ear. When we are about to walk we should take the first step with the left foot. We should apply this to all our physical actions. Through gaining familiqrity with this practice all our activities will be transformed into actions that are similar to those of the Dakinis, who in all their activities remember emptiness. This practice of actions of the left is a commitment of Mother Tantra. 199"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"How to attain Outer Pure Dakini Land through the Practice of Generation Stage There are three kinds of Vajrayogini practitioner: those who possess great fortune, those with middling fortune, and those with least fortune. HOW V AJRA YOGIN! PRACTITIONERS WHO POSSESS GREAT FORTUNE ATTAIN OUTER PURE DAKIN! LAND A practitioner of great fortune can attain outer Dakini Land before death by engaging in daily practice of generation stage, reciting the three-OM mantra, and making offerings on the tenth days.

Completing a great close retreat emphasizing self-generation After completing the nine preliminary practices we can engage in a great close retreat. The preparation and the way to engage in a great close retreat are basically the same as for doing close retreats in general, except that in this case we should collect ten million three-OM mantras and one million wisdom-descending mantras, all on the same cushion. Then, mainly using black sesame seeds, we should perform burning offerings of one million mantras, one tenth of the number recited during the great close retreat.

The preparations for this-setting up the heap 201"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND mandala of body, the nectar mandala of speech, the sindhura mandala of mind, the torrnas, and the other offerings-are the same as for the extensive offerings of the tenth day, and the retreat itself is basically the same as a close retreat. During the sessions we should sit facing the west. In each session we recite the self-generation sadhana, from going for refuge up to and including the yoga of inconceivability, and then we continue in accordance with the self-initiation sadhana with accomplishing the sindhura mandala and making exten-sive offerings and praises, up to just before receiving the empowerments. At this point we recite the mantra to the Vajrayogini generated in front of us. At the heart of the principal Deity of the sindhura mandala there is a phenomena-source. Inside this, on a moon cushion, there is a red letter BAM surrounded by the three-OM mantra. The BAM and mantra radiate countless red light rays which purify the negative karma of all sentient beings and make offer-ings to all the Buddhas. All their power and blessings gather back in the aspect of red light. This dissolves into the red letter BAM and mantra at the heart of the in-front-generated Deity. Then from the BAM and mantra wisdom-light radiates to our own heart and we receive the blessings of all the Dakinis. With this visualization we recite the three-OM mantra. We should do this in four sessions a day until we have completed four hun-dred thousand mantras. This practice is basically the· same as that in the self-initiation sadhana except that we do not send out the preliminary torrna, accomplish the vase, or take the four actual empowerments. We should know how the practice can be abbreviated or modified without omitting the essentials. Each day we need to arrange a new set of the three mandalas and make tsog offerings and other offerings. The sindhura powder should be changed every day and the old sindhura powder kept in a special container to be used later in the prac-tice of actualizing the effect. In the last session of each day we make torma offerings, tsog offerings, and thanking offerings, and we recite the long dedication prayers and the auspicious prayers. In this way we finish reciting the four hundred thousand three-OM mantras of the in-front-generated Deity. 202"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"HOW TO ATTAIN OUTER PURE DAKIN! LAND When this has been completed we make a container out of the stem of a langali tree, which is a tropical tree that resembles bamboo, except that it is thicker. We cut a section of the stem a few inches long. One end should be closed by a natural blockage in the wood and the other end should be open. Onto a piece of wood, which will be used to plug the open end of the hollow stem like a cork, we carve a joy swirl seal. We divide the sindhura powder that was collected each day into eight small bowls, set them out in front of the mandala, and then recite eight thousand three-OM mantras together with the same practice as in accomplishing the mandala. After we have recited one thousand mantras we empty one bowl of sindhura powder into the langali stem. We continue in this way until we have recited eight thousand mantras and all eight bowls of sindhura have been poured into the langali stem. Then we seal the top of the stem with the joy-swirl plug. The stem is then wrapped in a piece of red cloth which should envelop both ends. The cloth should be marked with a letter BAM, if possible with real gold, to indicate which way up it should stand. After completing these preparations, on the first tenth day of the month we perform the practice called 'accomplishing the sindhura with the langali stem'. The three mandalas, the offer-ings, tormas, and tsog offerings are prepared in exactly the same way as for making extensive offerings of the tenth days. The langali stem is placed upright at the centre of the sindhura mandala of mind with the letter BAM on the cloth :facing us. During the day we do the self-initiation practices according to the sadhana and make extensive offerings. In the evening, just before dark, with a Heruka practitioner to assist us, we take the langali stem to an isolated place that we have found to be suitable and which we should regard as the charnel grounds of Vajrayogini's mandala. When we arrive there we dig a triangularhole about eighteen inches deep, with one point directed towards the west. The stem is placed upright inside the hole and then covered with earth. The surface should be smoothed so that it is not noticeable to others, but we should mark or make a mental note of its whereabouts so that we can find it again. We then sit on top of the hole, facing west, and perform the 203"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND self-generation practice from going for refuge up to the mantra recitation while remembering that we and the sindhura in the langali stem are one with emptiness. We then meditate princip-ally on the uncommon yoga of inconceivability. While we are meditating, our assistant stays nearby, reciting the mantra emanating from the four mouths and the close-essence mantra of Heruka, OM HRIH HA HA HUM HUM PHAT, to prevent interruptions to our meditation. After finishing the session we return to the retreat house and practise the yoga of sleeping. The next day we perform self-initiation with extensive offerings as on the previous day, and at dusk we again go with our assistant to the isolated place, find the place where we buried the ·langali stem, and do a session in the same way as the previous day, but this time slightly longer. After the session we return to the retreat house and practise the yoga of sleeping. This should be repeated every day until the second tenth day, the twenty-fifth day of the Tibetan month, each day lengthening the duration. of the night session. On the second tenth day we again do self-initiation as before, making even more elaborate offerings. Then, at dusk, we go to the isolated place with our assistant and begin the session as before, but this time we continue the session throughout the night until dawn. In this session, after reciting the mantra, we should practise mainly the uncommon yoga of inconceivability with strong concentration and faith. Then, at dawn, we con-clude the session, remove the langali stem from the ground, and return with it tp the retreat house. We place the langali stem in the centre of the sindhura mandala, and finally, with extensive offerings, perform the self-initiation practices. Actualizing the effect The great close retreat, the practice of accomplishing the man-dala, and the langali stem practice are preparations that enable us eventually to meet with an emanation of Vajrayogini who will take us by the hand and lead us directly to her Pure Land. When all these preparations have been accomplished the time has come to leave samsaric places. We should think: 204"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"HOW TO ATTAIN OUTER PURE DAKINI LAND Now is the time to leave samsara and go to a perfect world, the Pure Land of the Dakinis. There is no reason to be attached to my home, friends, or possessions. I must leave the prison of samsara and, guided by Vajrayogini, go to her Pure Land. Then, without any attachment, doubt, or hesitation we leave our home and travel in search of an emanation of Vajrayogini. We take with us the langali stem filled with sindhura, and a small mirror. Every day we mark our forehead with sindhura, using the joy swirl seal on the langali stem. We should wander round cities, towns, big markets, public houses, large parties, wherever many women gather. We can travel to other countries and visit any of the Twenty-four Auspicious Places of Heruka. Maintaining strong divine pride of being Vajrayogini at all times, we imagine our wisdom eye beholds all women. We continue in this way without discouragement until one day we see a woman, old or young, who has the mark of the sindhura joy swirl seal on her forehead, exactly like our own. When this happens we should immediately look into the mirror to see if our joy swirl mark has disappeared. If it has, this clearly indic-ates that the woman is an emanation of Vajrayogini. We should not be concerned about whether she is beautiful or ugly, religious or seemingly non-religious. Even if outwardly she appears to deny the Dharma, we should have no doubt. We should mentally prostrate to her and request her to care for us. If possible we should also make verbal and physical prostrations and request her to accept us. She may not immediately agree to our request, but, knowing that we are now very close to achieving our final goal, we should remain undiscouraged. Sooner or later our wish will be fulfilled. This is the way practitioners of middling fortune complete the preparations and actualize the effect.

As mentioned before, outer Dakini Land is the Pure Land of Vajrayogini. When this is achieved as a result of generation stage practice, inner Dakini Land and Buddhahood can be attained within that same life through the practice of completion stage meditation.

Although an extensive explanation of objects of know-ledge is presented in Sutra teachings, if we do not study Tantric teachings we will gain only a rough understanding of Buddha-dharma. We will not achieve a deep understanding of Dharma through studying Sutra teachings alone. The teachings of High-est Yoga Tantra contain the most profound explanations of the bases, the paths, and the results of practice. There are innumerable basic objects of knowledge, but here we are concerned principally with three: 1 Objects of knowledge related to the body 2 Objects of knowledge related to the mind 3 Objects of knowledge related to the elements Objects of knowledge related to the b.ody To practise completion stage we need a human body that pos-sesses the six elements: bone, marrow, white drops, flesh, skin, and blood. The first three come from our father and the second three from our mother. Anyone, even an advanced Bodhisattva, who lacks these elements has no opportunity to practise com-pletion stage. As human beings we are very fortunate because we have these six elements and we have the opportunity to listen to, contemplate, and meditate on the teachings of Highest Yoga Tantra. Our present body is a gross temporary body ori~~nating from the bodies of our parents. Although it is now used by us, in actual fact it is a product of the sperm and egg of our parents. It is therefore a transformation of parts of others' bodies. Due to familiarity with self-grasping, we believe that this gross form is our true body. In reality, however, our true body is a very subtle body composed of the inner wind that is inseparable 209"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND from our very subtle mind. We have had this very subtle body since beginningless time, and it will remain with us forever. The dream body and bardo body are subtle bodies, and the illusory body is a very subtle body. In the intermediate state and in our dreams a subtle body naturally becomes manifest, but, until we achieve the illusory body, the very subtle body is never manifest. When we become a Buddha, the very subtle inner wind that forms our very subtle body transforms into a Buddha's Form Body and our very subtle mind becomes the omniscient mind of a Buddha. From this we can understand that all living beings have within them the seed of a Buddha's body, and that if they meet the Buddhadharma that explains how to ripen this seed they can become enlightened beings. Once we have achieved the pure illusory body our subtle body is always manifest. It becomes our actual body with which we naturally identify. At this stage, our subtle body is our true body and our gross body is like our house. When a highly realized practitioner who has achieved the illusory body finally leaves his or her gross body, ordinary beings believe that person has died, but their actual body never dies. The defining charac-teristic of death is the final separation of body and mind. Since the very subtle body never separates from the very subtle mind, once this body is always manifest we are free from death. When asked by one of his disciples to give an example of a deathless person, Khadrub Sangye Yeshe replied that thousands of Je Tsongkhapa' s disciples achieved the pure illusory body and that all these beings are deathless because they have achieved a vajra body that is completely free from death. Objects of knowledge related to the mind There are three kinds of mind: gross, subtle, and very subtle. The five sense consciousnesses, and the delusions that manifest within our mental continuum, are gross minds because they are produced by gross inner winds and are relatively easy to recognize. As we fall asleep, and as we die, our gross inner winds gradually dissolve into the central channel. Due to this dissolution we experience eight signs. These signs indicate dif-ferent levels of absorption of the inner winds. A mind that 210"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"COMPLETION STAGE experiences any of the first seven signs is a subtle mind because it depends upon subtle inner winds and because it is more difficult to recognize than the gross minds. A mind that experi-ences the eighth sign is a very subtle mind because it is con-joined with the very subtle inner wind and because it is even more difficult to recognize than the subtle minds. The very subtle mind is also called the 'continually residing mind', because it has been with us since beginningless time and will remain with us until we achieve Buddhahood. Other minds, such as the deluded minds of attachment, anger, and jealousy, are called 'temporary minds' because they will cease when we achieve liberation. The terms 'very subtle mind', 'con-tinually residing mind', and 'mind of dear light' all mean the same. There are two ways to realize the continually residing mind: intellectually through receiving an introductory explanation, or experientially by meditating on completion stage practices such as the yogas of channels, winds, and drops. When Gampopa told Milarepa of his special experience of concentration, Mila-repa replied that, although Gampopa' s experience was good, he should meditate on tummo as Milarepa himself did, and through this coine to recognize the nature of mind. By this Milarepa meant that by meditating on tummo Gampopa would attain a direct realization of the continually residing mind. Objects of knowledge related to the elt~ments There are three elements that are important in completion stage meditation: the channels, the drops, and the inm!r winds. It is said that the channels are like a house, the drops are like the furniture, and the inner winds are like the owner. By engaging in specific meditations on these three with strong concentration, our inner winds will gather and dissolve within the central channel and we will experience our continually resid-ing mind, the mind of dear light. When this mind manifests as a result of meditation, our mind becomes very peaceful and calm, free from distractions and disturbing conceptual thoughts. This experience is greatly superior to the tranquil abiding described in Sutra teachings. It is only by gaining this realization 211"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND that we can attain the deathless vajra body. Meditating on the continually residing mind is both an accumulation of merit and an accumulation of wisdom, and so it is a cause to attain both the Form Body and the Truth Body of a Buddha. There are three principal channels, six channel wheels or chakras, and seventy-two thousand subsidiary channels. These are explained in Clear Light. of Bliss. The red drops and the white drops that flow through our channels are the essence of blood and sperm respectively. During sexual intercourse, the two lower tips of the central channels of a man and woman join and interpenetrate, thereby causing the heat inside the channels to increase. This causes the white drops of the man and the red drops of the woman to melt and descend through the channels, and this induces bliss. Experienced completion stage practitioners can penetrate their own central channel and thereby increase the heat within it. Because of this, the white or red drops melt and flow down and up within the central channel, causing the practitioner to experience spontaneous great bliss for an extended period of time. These practitioners can then use their continually residing mind to meditate on emptiness, and finally mix with emptiness non-dualistically. The original red drop, from which the red drops and inner heat originate, is located principally at the centre of the navel channel wheel. The original white drop, from which the white drops and bodily strength develop, is located principally at the .centre of the crown channel wheel. The white and red drops are sometimes called bodhichittas. Actual bodhichitta, in this context, is spontaneous great bliss, which is the main cause for attaining enlightenment. Here the white and red drops are given the name of the effect because the melting and flowing of these drops within the central channel is a principal cause for the experience of spontaneous great bliss. The quintessential drop is the indestructible drop located at our heart inside the central channel. It is about the size of a very small pea. Its upper half is white and its lower half is red. This white and red drop is called 'indestructible' because it will not divide until we die. During the process of dying our inner 212"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"COMPLETION STAGE winds dissolve into this drop and cause it to open, thereby allowing our very subtle mind to leave and go to the next life. The inner winds are special energy-winds related to the mind that flow through our channels. Our mind cannot function without these winds. The mind can be likened to a lame person and our inner winds to a vehicle. Just as a lame person can move from place to place only by using a vehicle, so our mind can move to a fresh object only by depending upon our inner winds. It is extremely important to develop pure inner winds because if pure winds predominate the mind becomes calm and peaceful, whereas if impure winds predominate, negative thoughts and delusions will arise. The inner winds that flow through the right and left channels are impure. These impure winds are a root of samsara because they give rise to many conceptual thoughts that obscure the clarity of our mind. The inner winds that flow through the central channel are pure. These are the winds that cause the wisdom of great bliss to arise. The main point of Highest Yoga Tantra practice is to control the inner winds by gathering them from the subsidiary channels and dissolving them into the central channel. All completion stage meditations are methods to control our inner winds. When we gain control over our inner winds we also have full ·control over our mind. Je Tsongkhapa praised the yoga of winds because it is the principal method for controlling our inner winds. In Lamp Thoroughly Illuminating the Five Stages he says that all completion stage meditations are directly or indirectly included within the yoga of winds. There are five root inner winds and five branch inner winds. The various functions, locations, and characteristics of these winds are described in Clear Light of Bliss. Any inner wind that is the vehicle of a gross mind is a gross inner wind, and any inner wind that is the vehicle of a subtle mind is a subtle inner wind. The very subtle inner wind is the wind related to the very subtle mind. The ve1y subtle inner wind and the very subtle mind have the same nature and both are called 'indestructible'. It is our very subtle inner wind that transforms into the illusory body, and our very subtle mind 213"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKINI LAND that transforms into meaning clear light. Eventually the very subtle inner wind transforms into the Form Body of a Buddha and the very subtle mind transforms into a Buddha's mind.

The explanation of tummo meditation has five parts: 1 Visualizing the central channel 2 Visualizing the tummo letter 3 Meditating on the blazing of the tummo fire 4 Purifying imperfections 5 Generating the experience of great bliss and emptiness These five practices of tummo meditation are revealed in the dedication prayer in the extensive sadhana: When the reddish-black RAM residing in the centre of the three channels at my navel Has been set ablaze by my upper and lower winds, And its cleansing fire has burned away the seventy-two thousand impure elements, May my central channel be completely filled with pure drops. The first line explains how to visualize the central channel and the tummo letter, the second line reveals the meditation that 214"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"COMPLETION STAGE causes the tummo fire to blaze, the third line refers to purifying impurities through tummo meditation, and the fourth line refers to generating the experience of great bliss and emptiness, which depends on pure drops flowing through the central channel. In each session of meditation on tummo we begin by visualiz-ing in front of us our root Guru in the aspect of Buddha Vajrad-harma. We firmly believe that his body is the synthesis of all Sangha Jewels, his speech is the synthesis of all Dharma Jewels, and his mind is the synthesis of all Buddha Jewels. We then go for refuge, generate a special bodhichitta motivation, and with strong faith in Guru Vajradharma offer a mandala with the request: I request you my precious Guru, the essence of all Buddhas, Please bless me to be successful in the profound practice of tummo meditation, Please bless me to generate the union of great bliss and the wisdom realizing emptiness by gathering my inner winds in the central channel, Please bless me to pacify all outer, inner, and secret obstacles. We imagine that Guru Vajradharma dissolves into our heart and becomes one with us. We meditate on the emptiness of our body in order to prevent all ordinary appearances, and then we generate ourself as Vajrayogini. We imagine that our body is made of pure red light, non-obstructive like a rainbow, and we meditate single-pointedly on this. VISUALIZING THE CENTRAL CHANNEL The central channel is as thiek as an arrow. From its lower tip at the sex organ it ascends straight to the crown, travelling midway between our right and left sides but slightly closer to our back than to our chest. At the crown it curves forward and terminates between the eyebrows. We visualize the central channel as having three qualities: it is soft and smooth, like a flower petal; it is clear and transparent, like a candle flame; and it has a rich red colour, like pure blood. 215"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND The right channel, called 'roma' in Tibetan, is red, and the left channel, called 'kyangma', is white. Both are as thick as straws. The side channels and central channel ascend from the navel to the crown alongside each other. At the crown, the side channels separate from the central channel and curve down to the two nostrils. The lower tips of the side channels join the central channel at the navel, forming a vacuole inside the central channel. We should contemplate the central channel's nature, colour, shape, location, and qualities until we gain a rough mental image of it and then meditate on that image. By repeat-edly contemplating and meditating in this way we will improve the clarity of our image of the central channel. VISUALIZING THE TUMMO LETTER 'Tummo' or 'inner fire' refers to the original red drop, at the centre of the navel chakra, which has the nature of heat and is the source of all our bodily warmth. This drop is visualized as a red letter RAM, the seed-letter of the fire element, which is located inside the vacuole within the central channel at the centre of our navel channel wheel. This letter RAM, which is about the size of a sunflower seed, is dark red, radiates light, and is capped with a crescent moon, drop, and nada. We can visualize the letter RAM either as the English letter R capped with a crescent moon, drop, and nada, or as the Tibetan letter (see Apendix III). First we form a rough mental image of the RAM and then we imagine that our mind dissolves into it. We then concentrate on this single-pointedly for as long as possible. We need to do this meditation repeatedly over a period of time so that our experience of it improves. MEDITATING ON THE BLAZING OF THE TUMMO FIRE First we contract the muscles of the lower doors of the body slightly and draw in the stomach a little. Then we imagine that all the lower inner winds enter the central channel and gather just below the letter RAM at the navel. Next we inhale gently and swallow, imagining that all the upper inner winds enter the central channel and gather at the point just above the letter RAM. The lower and upper winds now unite at the navel. 216"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"COMPLETION STAGE We imagine that, because of the lower winds moving upwards inside the central channel, the letter RAM at the navel begins to glow like a red hot iron in a furnace, and that the nada blazes like a very tiny but intense fire. While holding the breath and the inner winds at the navel we meditate single-pointedly on the tiny fire of the nada. Just before we feel any discomfort we slowly exhale through both nostrils, not through the mouth. We repeat this process seven, fourteen, or twenty-one times in each session. PURIFYING IMPERFECTIONS While we are meditating on the blazing tummo fire, we imagine that the light of the tummo fire gradually permeates all the channels of our body and that, due to this, all the defects and imperfections of our channels, drops, and winds are purified. GENERATING THE EXPERIENCE OF GREAT BLISS AND EMPTINESS While meditating on the blazing tummo fire we imagine that all the pure red and white drops of the branch channels flow through the right and left channels jnto the central channel. They enter the central channel at the point where the side channels join it at the navel. Our central channel fills with pure red and white drops and we imagine that a sb:ong feeling of great bliss arises. With this mind of great bliss we meditate on the emptiness of persons and phenomena. Through skilful and continuous practice of tummo meditation our winds will enter, abide, and dissolve within the central channel without difficulty, and we will experience the eight signs mentioned previously. If, as a result of meditation, while inhaling and exhaling, our breath flows through both nostrils at the same time and with equal strength, this is a sign that our inner winds have entered the central channel. After this, if, as a result of continued medi-tation, both the breath and the movement of the abdomen cease, these are signs that our inner winds are abiding or remaining within the central channel. At some point after this 217"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND we will gradually experience the eight signs which indicate that the winds have actually dissolved within the central channel. A more detailed explanation of these signs is presented in Clear Light of Bliss. There are various systems for meditating on tummo. In the tummo meditation described in Clear Light of Bliss a short-AH is used instead of the letter RAM, and in other systems a letter BAM is used, but there is no essential difference between these three letters. The tummo meditation that is presented here is simpler than that presented in other instructions, mainly because it is not necessary to visualize channel wheels and so forth. Having centralized the inner winds, how to progress along the actual paths This has two parts: 1 How to develop and improve great bliss 2 How to develop and improve the rainbow body The main paths to full enlightenment are the wisdom of great bliss that realizes emptiness and the illusory body. By improv-ing these two we will attain the Truth Body and Form Body of a Buddha. How TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE GREAT BLISS We visualize the central channel as before, but this time without the side channels and the letter RAM. Just inside the entrance to the upper tip of the central channel, which is between the eyebrows, we visualize a small, red, single phenomena-source. This fits neatly into the entrance of the central channel. The long thin point has a hole at its tip and is inside the central channel. Of the remaining three points, which are flush with our skin, one points upwards, one to the right, and one to the left. At the lower tip of the central channel we visualize a similar phenomena-source, except that the tip inside the channel entrance has no hole. Inside the phenomena-source between the eyebrows, we 218"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"COMPLETION STAGE visualize a small spherical drop made of light of five colours and having the nature of the wisdom of great bliss of all Bud~ dhas. The centre of the drop is white, the eastern portion is blue, the southern portion is yellow, the western portion is red, and the northern portion is green. Lights of these five colours radiate from the drop. We meditate on this drop single~point~ edly while imagining that we experience bliss. Then we imagine that the blissful five~coloured drop begins to ascend through the central channel until it reaches the centre of the crown channel wheel. We meditate single~pointedly on this drop at the crown and, when a feeling of bliss arises, we imagine that a tiny white droplet emerges from the central portion and falls slowly down our central channel. When this droplet reaches our throat we hold it there for a short time and imagine with strong concen-tration that we experience joy. Then the drop descends further until it reaches our heart. When it reaches the heart we hold it for a short time and experience supreme joy. When the drop descends to our navel we concentrate on the experience of extraordinary joy. We then allow the drop to descend until it reaches the lower tip of our central channel. When it reaches this point we experience spontaneous joy. We keep the drop at the lower tip of the central channel for a while and then imagine that it begins to ascend, rising slowly through the central channel. When it reaches our navel we experience joy of reverse order, which is greater than the fourth joy; when it reaches our heart we develop supreme joy of reverse order; when it reaches our throat, we develop extra-ordinary joy of reverse order; and when it reaches our crown, it dissolves back into the main drop and we experience spon-taneous great joy of reverse order. We now meditate on the emptiness of persons and phenomena, trying to prevent any conventional appearances. This meditation can be repeated three, seven, or more times in one session. By doing this meditation regularly we will improve our experience of great bliss and emptiness. 219"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND HOW TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE THE RAINBOW BODY At our crown inside the central channel we visualize a five-coloured drop which is in essence the five Buddha Families. The drop sparkles with five-coloured lights. We meditate on this drop and experience great bliss. While experiencing great bliss we imagine that the radiance of the five-coloured lights gradually extends until it pervades our whole body. Our body becomes a mass of rainbow light with the nature of the five Buddha Families. The five lights continue to spread, gradually pervading our house, the immediate surroundings, the country, the whole world, and finally all three realms, including all sentient beings. Everything transforms into rainbow light, the nature of the five Buddha Families. We meditate on this with strong concentration for as long as possible. We then imagine that, from its outer reaches, this expanse of light gradually gathers inward until finally all environments, enjoyments, and living beings have dissolved into our body. Our body gradually dissolves, beginning with the feet, until finally it completely absorbs into the drop. This then dissolves into emptiness, and with a mind of great bliss we meditate on emptiness. The whole meditation is then repeated exactly as before, from visualizing the five-coloured drop at our crown to dissolving everything into the drop and meditating on emptiness with a mind of great bliss. We can do this meditation seven, fourteen, or twenty-one times in each session. As a result of sincere and continuous training in this medi-tation we will experience certain signs that we will soon attain the rainbow body. We will become aware that our body is becoming lighter than usual, or that our normally dark shadow appears to be less distinct, or that our footprints are less deep, or that in conditions of extreme heat or cold, even if exposed to hot sun or immersed in freezing water for a long time, we experience no physical discomfort and our bliss never dimin-ishes. We may even notice that if someone beats us with a stick we do not experience pain. The authentic rainbow body is the same as the actual illusory body. 220"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"COMPLETION STAGE How to attain the results The ultimate result of practising the generation and completion stages is the Union of No More learning. In this context 'Union' refers to the union of the pure body, the illusory body, and the pure mind, meaning clear light. This union is of two kinds, the Union that Needs Learning and the Union of No More Learn-ing. By progressing through the five stages of completion stage, eventually we will achieve the Union of No More Learning, or Buddhahood. The five stages of completion stage are: isolated speech, iso-lated mind, illusory body, meaning clear light, and Union. By doing the meditations described above we can improve our experience of these five stages and then, by relying on an action mudra, we can bring it to completion. Before we are able to dissolve the inner winds into the indes-tructible drop at our heart, we can experience the union of great bliss and emptiness by dissolving the inner winds into the central channel through the navel channel wheel, or through any of the points of entry into the central channel other than the heart channel wheel. This realization of great bliss and emptiness is called 'isolated speech' because with this experi-ence the practitioner is isolated from, or free from, ordinary appearance and conception of his or her own body and speech. The realization of great bliss and emptiness achieved through dissolving inner winds into the indestructible drop at the heart is called 'isolated mind', because with this experience the prac-titioner is isolated from ordinary appearance and conception of his or her mind. There are two stages in which inner winds dissolve into the indestructible drop. The first stage, in which some of the ten inner winds dissolve, can be achieved by solitary meditation. However, in order to achieve the second stage, in which all ten inner winds, including the pervasive inner winds, dissolve completely into the indestructible drop, it is necessary to rely on an action mudra. The correct time to rely on an action mudra is when we are able to dissolve most of the inner winds into the indestructible drop through solitary meditation. The moment we dissolve all 221"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN! LAND the inner winds in the indestructible drop by relying on an action mudra, we achieve the isolated mind of ultimate example clear light. When we arise from this concentration we achieve the illusory body, the third completion stage. This illusory body is called the 'impure illusory body' because at this stage we have not yet abandoned all delusions completely. Having achieved this illusory body, we meditate on empti-ness with the clear light mind of bliss. The moment our clear light mind of bliss realizes emptiness directly we achieve mean-ing clear light and become an Arya, or Superior being, who has completely abandoned all delusions. When we arise from the concentration of meaning clear light we achieve the pure illusory body, the actual vajra body. The next time we manifest meaning clear light we attain the union of the illusory body and meaning clear light. This union is called the 'Union that Needs Learning' and is the fifth of the five completion stages. By continuing to meditate on meaning clear light we will finally become completely free from the obstruc-tions to omniscience. Our illusory body will then become a Buddha's body and our meaning clear light will become a Bud-dha's mind. We will then have achieved Buddhahood, the great inner Dakini Land and the Union of No More Learning. This is the union of the ultimate illusory body, a Buddha's body, and the ultimate meaning clear light, a Buddha's mind. 222"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Dedication We should pray: Through the virtues I have accumulated by reading this book, May I become a Buddha for the benefit of all living beings.

They are like the root text, and the words of the commentary are like branches that grow from the root. If possible, we should try to memorize these outlines. In this way we will find that, even though we cannot remember all the words of the commentary, nevertheless we shall be able to recall their essential meaning. This will be of great benefit if we have to explain the practice to others. Also we will find it easy to apply the meaning of the commentary to our actual practice. For example, if, when we practise going for refuge according to the sadhana, we recall the relevant outlines, we shall be able to remember all the essential stages of going for refuge - visualizing the objects of refuge, developing renunci-ation, developing compassion, developing conviction in the power of the Three Jewels, and reciting the refuge prayer-and then we shall be able to practise accordingly. The outlines have been presented in the traditional manner in order to preserve the blessings of the lineage. Generally speaking they correspond to the headings within the comment-ary, although some of the divisions are not listed separately within the commentary. Moreover, the sequence of the outlines does not always correspond to the sequence of the text. For example, strictly speaking, the section on the actual generation stage meditation is the third part of the yoga of self-generation, and is listed as such within the outlines, but within the commo:?ntary it occurs later, just before the yoga of verbal and mental recitation, because this is the place in the sadhana where the actual medi-tation is done. 225"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN!

Here we are concerned solely with how to perform a burning offering to fulfil the commitment of a close retreat, for as it says in Ornament of Vajra Essence Tantra, All faults of excess and omission in Secret Mantra Are redressed by a burning offering. In the place where the burning offering is to be performed, first examine the site, seek permission to use it, and then purify it [by means of the site ritual appended to this sadhana]. Then, on ground that is naturally white, or that has been coloured white, begin by determining the very centre, and from that draw lines in each of the cardinal and intermediate directions. Take a piece of thread half a cubit in length, hold one end at the centre, and describe a circle. Then describe two more circles beyond that, each with a radius four finger-widths longer than the last. These are Muran and Kakyer respectively. Now hold the thread at the point where the eastern line intersects the inner circle, measure off the distance to the centre, and then swing the thread to the left and right:, marking the points where it intersects the inner circle. Then do the same from the western point. By drawing lines to connect these points the outline of a phenomena-source will emerge. Draw a second set of lines one finger-width inside these. Now, on the cardinal lines in each of the four directions, mark. a point two finger-widths beyond the outer circle. From these, measure the distance to each of the four intermediate lines and join these to form a square. This is the fireplace. At the heart of the phenomena-source in the centre of the 439"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"GUIDE TO DAKIN!

In each of the four corners [of the phenomena-source], apart from the front and the back, draw a joy swirl. The inside of the phenomena-source is col-oured red but its outline is white. The rest of the hearth and symbols should be only white in colour. Within Kakyer on the hearth draw a rosary of vajras and within Muran draw either a rosary of curved knives or fire. At each of the four corners of the hearth draw a half-moon marked by a vajra. When the hearth is drawn, erect a circle of milk-wood and other similar, clean firewood around the inner circle, Muran. Now you should arrange neatly to hand all the ritual sub-stances, leaving nothing out. These include the burning sub-stances, from milk-wood to the special pacifying substance, that are to be offered to both the mundane and supramundane Deities. These should be prepared according to the general system for pacifying. According to the words of the previous Lamas within this tradition, both alcohol and beef must be included. In addition there should be the tormas, two sets of outer offerings, two sets of garments, tambula tormas, the four waters, cleansing water, inner offering, a wind flag, a small pile of kusha grass, a ladle and a funnel, and materials for lighting the fire. 440"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Vajrayogini Burning Offering Sadhana There are three stages to the burning offering: 1 The preliminaries 2 The actual practice 3 Subsequent activities THE PRELIMINARIES Begin by practising the stages of self-generation up to and includ-ing the yoga of inconceivability (pp 269-97).

Since there is no separate mantra for the special pacifying substance it should be offered with the Deity's mantra. Since the milk-wood and the molten butter are the principal offerings, each time one of these is offered it is counted as one burning offering.
