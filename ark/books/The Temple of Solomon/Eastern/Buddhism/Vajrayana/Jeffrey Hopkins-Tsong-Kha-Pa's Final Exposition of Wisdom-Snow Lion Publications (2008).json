There I found that the Dalai Lama was about to begin a sixteen-day series of four- to six-hour lec-tures on Tsong-kha-pa Lo-sang-drak-pa’s Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment Practiced by Persons of Three Capacities. Despite my cynicism that a governmentally appointed reincarnation could possibly have much to offer, I slowly became fascinated first with the strength and speed of his articulation and then, much more so, with the touching meanings that were conveyed. Enthused by his commentary, I translated the section on special insight shortly thereafter, checking about half of it with Lati Rinpoche by orally retranslating the English back into Tibetan. Returning to it in 2002,a I could recognize from my intervening work (on another Ful-bright) on Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen’s Mountain Doctrine: Final Unique Quintessential Instructionsb what Tsong-kha-pa was often seeking to refute. Thus this book first provides Tsong-kha-pa’s presentation of special insight, as well as the sections on the object of negation and on the two truths in his Illumination of the Thought: Extensive Explanation of (Chandrakīrti’s) “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle,’” and then details Dol-po-pa’s views and Tsong-kha-pa’s reactions to them.

Studying and practicing in Am-do until age sixteen, he left for Central Tibet, never to return to Am-do. In Central Tibet, Chö-jay Don-drup-rin-chend advised him to study the Five Great Books of Indian Buddhism: 1. the coming Buddha Maitreya’s Ornament for Clear Realization,e a ren-dering of the hidden teaching on the path structure in the Perfec-tion of Wisdom Sūtras 2.

A notable exception is the curriculum at the monastery of the Paṇ-chen Lama, Tra-shi-hlün-po Monastic Univer-sity (bkra shis lhun po), where Dharmakīrti’s Pramāṇavārttika is the topic of this initial long period of study. f tshad ma rnam ’grel, pramāṇavarttika; Peking 5709, vol. 130. g dbu ma la ’jug pa, madhyamakāvatāra; Peking 5261, Peking 5262, vol. 98. Since Chandrakīrti often refers to Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle (dbu ma’i bstan bcos, madhyamakaśāstra) merely by the appellation madhyamaka, the madhyamaka of “madhya-makāvatāra” is held to refer to a text propounding the middle, specifically Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle. My translation of avatāra (’jug pa) as “supplement” is controver-sial; others use “introduction” or “entrance,” both of which are attested common trans-lations in such a context. My translation is based on the explanation by Tsong-kha-pa that Chandrakīrti was filling in holes in Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle; see Tsong-kha-pa, Kensur Lekden, and Jeffrey Hopkins, Compassion in Tibetan Buddhism (London: Rider, 1980; reprint, Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, 1980), 96-99. Among the many meanings of the Tibetan term for avatāra, ’jug pa can mean “to affix” or “to add on.” To summarize the oral teachings of the late Ken-sur Nga-wang-lek-den: Avatāra means “addition” in the sense that Chandrakīrti’s text is a supple-ment historically necessary so as to clarify the meaning of Nāgārjuna’s Trea-tise on the Middle. He wanted to make clear that the Treatise should not be in-terpreted according to the Mind-Only system or according to the Middle Way"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 Three Translations of Tsong-kha-pa’s Views presentation of the explicit teaching on the emptiness of inherent existence in the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras 4.

Guṇaprabha’s Aphorisms on Discipline,b the source text for formu-lated codes of discipline. These five texts became the basic curriculum of sūtra study in the monasteries that Tsong-kha-pa and his followers established. From childhood, Tsong-kha-pa’s study and practice was interlaced with tantra, which became the focus of a majority of his writings. He studied a great deal with masters of the Ka-gyuc and Sa-kyad orders. As                                 Autonomy School (dbu ma rang rgyud pa, svatantrikamādhyamika), the founding of which is attributed to Bhāvaviveka. During Nāgārjuna’s lifetime, Bhā-vaviveka had not written his commentary on the Treatise, nor had he founded his system; therefore, it was necessary later to supplement Nāgārjuna’s text to show why it should not be interpreted in such a way. Moreover, it is said that Chandrakīrti sought to show that a follower of Nāgārjuna should ascend the ten grounds by practicing the vast paths necessary to do so. This is be-cause some interpret the Middle Way perspective as nihilistic. They see it as a means of refuting the general existence of phenomena rather than just their inherent existence and conclude that it is not necessary to engage in prac-tices such as the cultivation of compassion. Therefore, in order to show that it is important to engage in three central practices—compassion, non-dual un-derstanding, and the altruistic mind of enlightenment—and to ascend the ten Bodhisattva grounds, Chandrakīrti—in reliance on Nāgārjuna’s Precious Gar-land—wrote this supplementary text. See Jeffrey Hopkins, Buddhist Advice for Living and Liberation: Nāgārjuna’s Precious Garland (Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, 1998).

It also per-haps accords with the fifth meaning given in Vaman Shivaram Apte, Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Poona, India: Prasad Prakashan, 1957), 163, “Any new appearance, growth, rise,” though it seems that not much of a case can be made from the Sanskrit. Of course, such a supplement also serves as an introduction, or means of entry, to Nāgārjuna’s Treatise. a chos mngon pa’i mdzod, abhidharmakośa; Peking 5590, vol. 115. b ’dul ba’i mdo, vinayasūtra; Peking 5619, vol. 123. c bka’ brgyud. d sa skya."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"    Background    15   Stephen Batchelor says in The Tibet Guide:a While still very young he was recognized as possessing unusual spiritual qualities and as a young man was sent to Central Tibet to further his understanding of Buddhism in the more cultured region of the country. The first monastery he visited was that of Drigung, where he studied medicine and the doctrines of the Kagyu lineage. From here he proceeded to Netang, Samye, Zhalu, and Sakya monasteries. He met his main teacher Ren-dawa at Tsechen Monastery just outside Gyantse. For many years he studied the full range of Buddhist philosophy, includ-ing the more esoteric tantric systems. He then retreated to Olka, north of the Brahmaputra downstream from Tsetang, and spent the next four years in intense retreat. Upon returning to society he found himself much in demand as a teacher. One place where he taught was the hill in Lhasa on which the Potala was eventually built. Together with Rendawa he stayed for some time at Reting, where he composed his most famous work, The Great Exposition of the Stages on the Path to Enlighten-ment. After another meditation and writing retreat at Chöding Hermitage (above where Sera monastery now is), he founded, in 1409, the famous annual Mönlam (prayer) festival in Lhasa, which, after a twenty-five year hiatus, was reinaugurated in 1986.... During his lifetime Tsongkhapa was regarded as a remark-able spiritual figure whose genius and saintliness held him above the sectarian differences of his times. Although greatly inspired by the example of Atisha, to the point of attributing authorship of his own major written work to him, and by the spirit of the Kadampa tradition, Tsongkhapa nonetheless stud-ied widely with representatives of all the major orders in Tibet and assimilated their lineages. Though some question whether Tsong-kha-pa intended to found a new order, it strikes me that the construction of seventy buildings in one               a Stephen Batchelor, The Tibet Guide: Central and Western Tibet (Boston: Wisdom Publica-tions, 1998), 129-131.

In any case, the writings of his immediate followers, such as Gyel-tsap,e Ke-drup,f and the latter’s brother Ba-so-chö-kyi-gyel-tsen,g clearly indicate the raising of this seminal teacher to the status of saint and founder of a new religious order. His followers eventually came to have great influence throughout a vast region stretching from Kalmyk Mongolian areas, where the Volga empties into the Caspian Sea (in Europe), to Outer and Inner Mongolia, and the Buriat Republic of Siberia, as well as to most parts of Tibet and Ladakh. They established a system of education centered in monastic universities of varying size that became some of the prime centers of religious education in the region.

Thus, the three translations in this book are from his final two compo-sitions on the view of emptiness. The first translation is the section on special insight in his next-to-last exposition of the view of emptiness, the Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment. Here Tsong-kha-pa presents the topic of wisdom in a far more accessible manner than he did sixteen years earlier in his Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path. In other sec-tions of the Medium-Length Exposition he merely condenses the Great Treatise, but for the section on wisdom he structures a new composition with the exception that the beginning and the end (these being chap-ters one and eleven in the following translation) are condensations of the Great Treatise. The most striking addition is the long section on the two truths (chapters seven through nine in the translation below), for which there is no corresponding section in the Great Treatise. Also, of one hundred and forty-six scriptural citations from Indian texts in the section on special insight in the Medium-Length Exposition, seventy-six are not found in the Great Treatise.

In this new exposition he presents at length the two truths, obscu-rational truths and ultimate truth, from the viewpoint of Chandrakīrti’s Middle Way Consequence School with particular emphasis on: • the mode of difference between the two truths (105ff.) • the multiple meanings of saṃvṛti and how obscurational truths are truths for ignorance but are not posited by ignorance (109ff.) • how the two truths are not two ways of perceiving the same object (114ff.) • how one can know an obscurational truth, such as a pot, but not know it as an obscurational truth (115) • how real and unreal conventionalities are posited just in relation to conventional valid cognition (116ff.) • how the ultimate truth is non-deceptive (121) • how the ultimate truth is found, or realized, by wisdom but cannot bear analysis by wisdom and thus is not truly established (122) • how nirvāṇa is an ultimate truth (125) • how all phenomena, ultimate and conventional, exist only conven-tionally (125ff.) • how what exists conventionally cannot be undermined by valid cognition (127ff.) • how the ultimate is seen in the manner of non-seeing (129ff.) • how a Buddha perceives pure and impure conventionalities (135)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"    Background    23   • how to understand the meaning of actual ultimates and concordant ultimates so as to eliminate that pristine wisdom itself is an ulti-mate truth in the Middle Way School (138ff.) • how there are only two truths based on the deceptive and the non-deceptive being a dichotomy (148ff.) Tsong-kha-pa also cites passages from Nāgārjuna’s Sixty Stanzas of Rea-soning to show that emptiness is approached through the reasoning of dependent-arising (55), that nirvāṇa also is empty of inherent existence (100), and that Buddhas perceive conventional phenomena (137), and he explains passages in Nāgārjuna’s Praise of the Element of Attributes and Praise of the Supramundane to show that his Collection of Praises is har-monious with his Collection of Reasonings in terms of the view of real-ity (98ff.). The last two translations in Part One are drawn from Tsong-kha-pa’s final exposition of the view of emptiness, the Illumination of the Thought: Extensive Explanation of (Chandrakīrti’s) “Supplement to (Nāgār-juna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle.’” The first treats the issue of the difference between the Autonomy School and the Consequence School concerning the object of negation in emptiness. Tsong-kha-pa explains the topic not from the viewpoint of the controversy between Bhāvaviveka on one side and Buddhapālita and Chandrakīrti on the other, as he did in the Great Treatise, but by way of contrasting Kamalashīla’s Illumination of the Middle with Chandrakīrti’s views. The last translation is Tsong-kha-pa’s commentary on Chandrakīrti’s presentation of the two truths, thereby fortifying and expanding on his treatment in the Medium-Length Exposition. Throughout these translations quotations are cross-referenced so that Tsong-kha-pa’s treatments of them can be compared—“Insight” referring to the special insight section of the Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment and “Illumination” referring to Illu-mination of the Thought: Extensive Explanation of (Chandrakīrti’s) “Supple-ment to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’”. These three translations provide a vantage point from which to contrast the views of the Tibetan scholar whom Tsong-kha-pa took as his main opponent in his writings on the view of emptiness, Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen. Part Two presents this controversy structured around how these two great authors treat specific Indian source quota-tions. My aim is to bring more clarity to both of their views in the mir-ror of contrast."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" SUPRAMUNDANE SPECIAL INSIGHT From Tsong-kha-pa Lo-sang-drak-pa’s Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment Practiced by Persons of Three Capacities"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 27 1. The Source Tradition The explanation of how to train in special insight has four parts: pre-requisites for special insight, divisions of special insight, how to culti-vate special insight, and the measure of having established special in-sight through meditative cultivation. Prerequisites for special insight This section has two parts: general exposition of the prerequisites for special insight and how to delineate the view in particular. General exposition of the prerequisites for special insight Kamalashīla’s second [of three worksa on the] Stages of Meditationb says that relying on an excellent being, seeking hearing of the doctrine from that person, and proper contemplation are the three prerequisites for special insight. The generation of the view realizing suchness by the wisdoms of hearing and thinking—upon having heard the stainless texts in dependence on scholars who unmistakenly know the essentials of the scriptures—is an indispensable prerequisite for special insight.c For, if you do not have a view decisive to the fullest extent with respect to the meaning of the mode of beingd [of phenomena, that is, empti-ness], it is impossible to generate realization of the special insight real-izing the modee [of being of phenomena]. Furthermore, such a view must be sought by one who is relying not on interpretable meanings but on the definitive meaning.f Hence, it is               a These are not three chapters or sections of one work; they are three separate works on the same topic.

Consequently, you should rely on an unmistaken commentary [of Buddha’s] thought. On whom should you rely? He is the Superior Nāgārjuna, widely renowned in the three levels [below, above, and on the ground], whom the Supramundane Victor himself prophesied very clearly in many sū-tras and tantras as unraveling the essence of his teaching—the pro-found meaning [of emptiness] devoid of all extremes of [inherent] exis-tence and no [nominal] existence.b Therefore, you should seek the view realizing emptiness in dependence on his texts. Since Āryadeva is taken to be as valid as the master [Nāgārjuna] even by great Proponents of the Middle such as the masters Buddha-pālita, Bhāvaviveka, Chandrakīrti, Shāntarakṣhita, and so forth, both the father [Nāgārjuna] and his spiritual son [Āryadeva] are sources for the other Proponents of the Middle.c Hence, earlier [Tibetan scholars rightly] used the convention “Proponents of the Middle of the model texts” for those two and “partisan Proponents of the Middle” for the others. Some earlier [Tibetan] spiritual guides [wrongly]d said that from the viewpoint of how Proponents of the Middle posit conventionalities,                                 Rely on doctrine, but do not rely on persons. Rely on meaning, but do not rely on words. Rely on definitive meaning, but do not rely on interpretable meaning. Rely on pristine wisdom, but do not rely on consciousness. For Jam-yang-shay-pa’s detailed explanation of these by way of persons, times, and four validities as well as for identifying the four to be relied upon, the four not to be relied upon, and the benefits of the four reliances, see Jeffrey Hopkins, Maps of the Pro-found: Jam-yang-shay-ba’s Great Exposition of Buddhist and Non-Buddhist Views on the Nature of Reality (Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, 2003), 316-318. a For Tsong-kha-pa’s exposition of this in the Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path, see Tsong-kha-pa, Great Treatise, vol. 3, 112-114, and Napper, Dependent-Arising and Emptiness, 159-163 and 247-267. b For a detailed account of the prophecies of Nāgārjuna, see Hopkins, Nāgārjuna’s Pre-cious Garland, 9-21. c The material in this paragraph through the remainder of this chapter is in Great Trea-tise, vol. 3, 115-117; for detailed analysis see Napper, Dependent-Arising and Emptiness, 164-167 and 268-283. d Tsong-kha-pa, after quoting Ye-shay-day on this topic below, explains that Chandrakīrti does not fit either of these."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" The Source Tradition 29 they are designated as two types: • Sūtric Proponents of the Middle,a who assert that external objects exist in conventional termsb • Yogic Proponents of the Middlec who assert that in conventional terms there are no external objects.

Tsong-kha-pa’s expositions of these two positions in his Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path and his later Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path differ slightly. Let us cite these with the differences highlighted; first the Great Exposition: those propounding an establishment of illusion by a rational consciousness, who assert that a composite of appearance and emptiness is an ultimate truth, and those propounding thorough non-abiding, who assert that a mere exclusionary elimination of the proliferations with respect to appearances is the ultimate truth (snang stong gnyis tshogs don dam bden par ’dod pa sgyu ma rigs grub pa dang snang ba la spros pa rnam par bcad pa tsam don dam bden par ’dod pa rab tu mi gnas par smra ba’o) and the Medium-Length Exposition: those propounding an establishment of illusion by a rational consciousness, who assert that a composite of the appearances of the subject, such as a sprout, and of its absence of true existence is an ultimate truth and those pro-pounding thorough non-abiding, who assert that an inclusionary elimina-tion—an exclusionary elimination of the proliferations with respect to ap-pearances—is the ultimate truth (myu gu la sogs pa’i chos can dang bden med kyi snang ba tshogs pa don dam bden par ’dod pa sgyu ma rigs grub pa dang snang ba la spros pa rnam par bcad pa’i yongs gcod don dam bden par ’dod pa rab tu mi gnas par smra ba’o) The additions to his earlier explanation of those propounding an establishment of illu-sion by a rational consciousness merely identify the composite more clearly, whereas his addition of “inclusionary elimination” to his explanation of those propounding thorough non-abiding is more dramatic in that it serves to exclude his own position that the actual ultimate is a non-affirming negative, or mere exclusionary elimination. For my speculation on what this inclusionary elimination might be, see footnote b, p. 144."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight consciousness,a who assert that a composite of the appearances of the subject, such as a sprout, and of its absence of true existence is an ultimate truth,b and • those propounding thorough non-abiding,c who assert that an in-clusionary eliminationd—an exclusionary elimination of the prolif-erations with respect to appearances—is the ultimate truth.e They asserted those propounding an establishment of illusion by a ra-tional consciousness to be the masters Shāntarakṣhita, Kamalashīla, and so forth.f Some Indians also accepted the designations “illusion-like” and “thoroughly non-abiding.” The great translator [Lo-den-shay-rapg rightly] says [in his Epistolary Essay, Drop of Ambrosia],h “The positing of the two from the viewpoint of how the ultimate is asserted is an ob-scured presentation generating amazement.”i Concerning this, the master Ye-shay-dayj explains that:               a sgyu ma rigs grub pa, or Reason-Established Illusionists. b For Tsong-kha-pa’s later consideration of this position, see 143. c rab tu mi gnas par smra ba, or Proponents of Thorough Non-Abiding. d yongs gcod; an elimination that includes something positive. e Tsong-kha-pa mentions this position later (144). f Tsong-kha-pa refutes this identification later (144). g blo ldan shes rab, rngog lo chen po; 1059-1109. h spring yig bdud rtsi’i thigs pa; see Napper, Dependent-Arising and Emptiness, 165, 271, 275-276, 405, 667 n. 75, and 740 n. 316. i Since Tsong-kha-pa himself posits the Autonomy and Consequence schools as subdi-visions of the Middle Way School by way of their assertions of the ultimate, his objec-tion concerns this particular way of making the divisions. There are two types of amazement, at the good and at the bad. The Four Interwoven Annotations on (Tsong-kha-pa’s) “Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path” (vol. 2, 168.3) explains that this is “not a presentation pleasing excellent scholars but merely a pres-entation causing the obscured (rmongs pa rnam) to generate amazement,” in which case it is the obscured’s amazement at something they think is good, and thus should be translated as “The positing of the two from the viewpoint of how the ultimate is as-serted is a presentation generating amazement [in] the obscured.” However, I take “obscured” (rmongs pa) as modifying the presentation, in which case the amazement is Lo-den-shay-rap’s amazement at something bad.

The stages are as follows: • to some they teach doctrines to turn them away from ill-deeds such as killing; this is so that these trainees who have the thought-patterns of beings of small capacity may achieve the ranks of gods or humans as fruits of their merit • to some trainees who have the thought-patterns of beings of middle ca-pacity they teach doctrines based on the duality of apprehended object and apprehending subject and that cyclic existence is one-pointedly to be abandoned and nirvana is one-pointedly to be adopted • to some trainees they teach ultimately established consciousness empty of a difference in substantial entity between apprehended object and ap-prehending subject, thereby teaching to them [doctrine that is] not based on duality • to some trainees of highest faculties, who will achieve the unsurpassed"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight the system of Cognition-Onlya [or Mind-Only] and presented a system in which external objects exist in conventional terms.

The chronology of the clarification [of the model texts of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva by those masters] through great treatisesc is evident in accordance with that [explanation by Ye-shay-day].d However, al-though the master Chandrakīrti asserts that external objects exist in conventional terms, he does not do so in comparison with another tenet system.

How-ever, Tsong-kha-pa does not take Ye-shay-day’s statement as a mere chronology of great Mādhyamikas who asserted tenets in accordance with those systems because there were earlier great Proponents of the Middle who had assertions similar to Bhā-vaviveka and Shāntarakṣhita.

His Autocom-mentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’” says (Louis de La Vallée Poussin, Madhyamakāvatāra par Candrakīrti, Bibliotheca Buddhica 9 [Osnabrück, Germany: Biblio Verlag, 1970], 406.9, commenting on stanzas XIII.1 and 2): May scholars ascertain that just as, except for Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle, this doctrine called “emptiness” is not expressed non-erroneously in other treatises, so the system that appears in this [treatise]—set out together with objections and answers to any [other] system—does not exist, in terms of the doctrine of empti-ness, in other treatises. Therefore, it should be understood that a certain [scholar’s] propounding that just what are propounded ul-timately in the system of the Sūtra School are asserted convention-ally by Proponents of the Middle Way School is a proposition only by one who does not know the suchness of Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle. At the end of also saying such with respect to the system of the Great Exposi-tion School (La Vallée Poussin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 407.1), [Chandrakīrti] says: This is because a supramundane doctrine is not fit to be similar to a mundane doctrine. May scholars ascertain that this system is un-shared. Through the reason of his own system’s not being shared with other Propo-nents of the Middle Way School, [Chandrakīrti] posits that one who asserts that what are propounded ultimately by the two Proponents of [Truly Exis-tent External] Objects [that is, the Great Exposition School and the Sūtra School] are propounded conventionally by Proponents of the Middle Way School does not know the Middle Way suchness. The reason is that, in the [Consequentialists’] own system, even conventionally, phenomena that are established by way of their own character are not asserted, whereas those [Proponents of True Existence] only posit [all phenomena] in the context of that [establishment of objects by way of their own character]. If one falls from either of the two truths, one also falls from the other; therefore, it is not suitable that a supramundane doctrine that has not fallen from the mode of the two truths be similar in terms of either of the two truths with a mundane doctrine that has fallen from the two truths. There-fore, this system of the Superior [Nāgārjuna]—in terms not only of the ulti-mate but also of the conventional—is not shared with the schools of the Pro-ponents of True Existence. *The bracketed additions are mostly drawn from Ta-drin-rap-ten’s Annotations, 270.5-272.6.

It strikes me that Chandrakīrti gave his commentary on Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle this title in contrast to Bhāvaviveka’s commentary, Lamp for (Nā-gārjuna’s) “Wisdom” (shes rab sgron me, prajñāpradīpa) which, due to its brevity and lack of elaboration, is often difficult to fathom and thus unclear. As an example of such diffi-culty, see Bhāvaviveka’s refutation of Buddhapālita’s explanation of the refutation of production from self (Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness, 461ff ). Also, in the Clear Words Chandrakīrti gives a very clear picture of the movement of Nāgārjuna’s refutations by citing the qualm that each step answers, such as in his brilliant commentary on the second chapter of the Treatise. Stcherbatsky, in his The Conception of Buddhist Nirvana, however, indicates that at least for him Chandrakīrti’s text is not clear and that the title seems ironic (75, n.1): Candrakīrti has given to his commentary the title of “The Clearworded” (prasanna-padā) probably not without some dose of irony, since, as Prof. Was-silieff attests, its extreme dialectical subtlety, especially in the first chapter, is equaled by no other work in the whole domain of Northern Buddhist litera-ture. In the same vein, Mervyn Sprung (xii) says about the first chapter, in defense of his abridgements of the text: ...[the excisions] are, without exception I believe, concerned with Can-drakīrti’s controversy with Bhāvaviveka, his rival commentator within the Mādhyamika school, or with his support of Buddhapālita, a commentator he attempts to follow, or else with traditional arguments of the Sāṃkhya school having to do with causation.

In Ge-luk-pa scholastic centers of learning this very controversy between the three masters of the Middle Way School is used as the means for gaining access to the Middle Way School, as it is the first major topic of debate in the Middle Way class of ge-shay studies at the point of the sixth chapter of Chandrakīrti’s Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle.” Chandrakīrti’s Clear Words forms the basis of the study with commentaries, such as that by Jam-yang-shay-pa, used to unravel its meaning; it is because of the clarity that I found in using Jam-yang-shay-pa’s commentary that this controversy could be included in Part Five of my Meditation on Emptiness.

Thus, you must meditate on suchness as an antidote to ignorance.

Ignorance is the opposite of knowledge, but knowledge should not be taken as just any knowledge; rather, it is wisdom knowing such-ness—selflessness.

He explains that desire and so forth are like a snake imputed to a rope from the viewpoint of being imputed to be established by way of their own nature whereas they are not. A rope-snake and desire and so forth are not similar in terms of whether they do or do not exist in conven-tional terms [since a rope-snake does not exist in conventional terms whereas desire and so forth do]. For those reasons, the mode of apprehending true existence—the object of negation—is to conceive [that objects] are not posited through the force of beginningless conceptuality but are established objectively by way of their own entity.b The conceived object of that apprehension is called “self,” or “inherent existence.” The non-existence of that with a person as the substratum is called a selflessness of a person, and the non-existence of that with [other] phenomena such as an eye, ear, and so forth as the substratum is called a selflessness of phenomena.

Jam-yang-shay-pa’s cogent point is that Tsong-kha-pa’s meaning is that refuting that the “I,” for instance, does not depend on causes and does not change is not itself a refu-tation of the innate misapprehension of the inherent existence of the “I,” because the apprehension that the “I” is independent and immutable does not constitute the innate apprehension that the “I” inherently exists, that is to say, exists in its own right.

Although the system of this [passage] differs from the mode of positing two apprehensions of self [in the Consequence School] as explained above, the stages of how afflictive emotions are produced [according to the Consequence School] can be understood in dependence on it. Moreover, initially when the “I” that is the object of observation of the thought “I” is apprehended to exist by way of its own character, desire with respect to the self is generated. That generates attachment to the self ’s pleasure. Also, since the self ’s pleasure is not independent but depends on the “mine,” there is attachment to the “mine.” Obscur-ing the disadvantages of the “mine,” this attachment brings about per-ception of the “mine” as advantageous.

In brief, when the many supreme scholars who commented on the meaning of the scriptures on the profound [emptiness] delineated the meaning of suchness, they analyzed by way of scripture and reasoning. They did this from having perceived that selflessness and emptiness cannot be realized without seeing that the self as apprehended by er-roneous apprehension does not exist and without seeing the emptiness of that self. It is important to gain ascertainment with respect to this. For if you do not meditate on the meaning of the negation of the erroneous object that is the root of being bound in cyclic existence, even though you meditate on the meaning of something else that you consider to be profound, it will not harm the apprehension of self at all: • because unless the mind becomes absorbed in the suchness of self-lessness and emptiness, an overcoming of the apprehension of self cannot occur, and • because without rejecting the object of the apprehension of self, although you perform the mere withdrawal of the mind that moves over there to its object, this cannot be posited as being absorbed in selflessness. The reason for this is that there are three modes of the mind’s operat-ing on an object—(1) apprehending the object of observation to truly exist, (2) apprehending it to not truly exist, and (3) apprehending it without qualifying it with either of those. Hence, just as although one is not apprehending [an object] as not truly existent, one is not necessar-ily apprehending it as truly existent, so, although one is not involved in the two selves, it is not necessary that one is involved in the two self-lessnesses. For there are limitless minds abiding in the third category. Furthermore, because the two apprehensions of self operate mainly within observing effective things, persons and phenomena, you need to delineate that just those bases—with respect to which the error is made—do not exist in the way that they are apprehended. Otherwise, it is like searching for a robber on the plain after the robber has gone to the woods. Since error is removed by meditating on the meaning that has been delineated in this way, such an emptiness is the supreme meaning of suchness, but delineation of the meaning of suchness as something else forsaking this is reduced to being only imputed by one’s own wish.

When that is overcome, the other afflictive emotions—desire and so forth—which have the view of the transitory as their root are overcome. When they are overcome, actions motivated by them are overcome. When they are overcome, powerless birth in cyclic existence impelled by actions is overcome, whereby liberation is attained. Think-ing about this, you should generate firm ascertainment and then unerr-ingly seek the view of suchness. Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle says:a By extinguishing actions and afflictive emotions [which are the causes producing cyclic existence], there is liberation.

The reason why it must be done this way is that although there is no difference in subtlety with regard to the selflessness to be ascer-tained in terms of the persons or phenomena that are its substrata, self-lessness is easier to ascertain in terms of a person due to essentials of the substratum,a whereas it is more difficult to ascertain in terms of [other] phenomena. This is like the fact that, for example, since it is more difficult to ascertain the selflessness of phenomena in terms of an eye, ear, and so forth and easier to ascertain it in terms of a reflection and so forth, the latter are posited as examples for delineating selfless-ness in terms of the former.b In consideration of this fact, the King of Meditative Stabilization Sūtra also says (see also Insight, 87; Illumination, 204):c Just as you know [how to generate] discrimination [taking to mind the delineation of the mode of subsistence] of a self, Apply this mentally to all [phenomena]. [The reason for this is that] all phenomena are [established as               a In his 1972 lectures, the Dalai Lama suggested that a reason for this is that the person is already considered by the other Buddhist systems to be imputedly existent. b In his 1972 lectures, the Dalai Lama noted that Tsong-kha-pa’s presentation here dif-fers slightly from that in his Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path, where he uses as an example the coarse falsity of a reflection of a face being empty of establishment as a face, which, of course, is realized by ordinary beings who have not realized emptiness. That is used as an example, or analog, of a reflection of a face being empty of inherent existence. However, here the emptiness of inherent existence of a reflection is used as a similar example in the process of realizing the emptiness of inherent existence of phe-nomena such as an eye, an ear, and so forth. The difference between the two is ex-plained as being for different trainees; the description in the Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path is for those whose continuums have not matured, whereas the description in the Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path is for those whose continuums have matured. The Dalai Lama reported that according to Jam-yang-shay-pa it could be that first one contemplates coarse falsity and then as one’s understanding becomes more profound, one realizes subtle selflessness with respect to a reflection of a face, where-upon this is used as an example for realizing the subtle selflessness of other phenom-ena. c ting nge ’dzin rgyal po’i mdo, samādhirājasūtra, XII.7; Toh. 127, mdo sde, vol. da, 44a.2-44a.3; cited in Prasannapadā, in commentary to stanza IV.9; Toh. 3860, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 43b.1-43b.2; La Vallée Poussin, Mūlamadhyamakakārikās (Mādhyamikasūtras) de Nāgārjuna avec la Prasannapadā Commentaire de Candrakīrti (Osnabrück, Germany: Biblio Verlag, 1970), 128.11-128.13: yathā jñāta tayā ’tmasaṃjña tathaiva sarvatra peṣitā buddhiḥ / sarve ca tatsvabhāvā dharma viśuddhā gagaṇakalpāḥ // ekena sarvaṃ jñānāti sarvam ekena paśyati /.

This sūtra speaks of the collection of the aggregates as the basis of imputation of a person. A basis of imputation is not feasible to be the object imputed, and the collection of the aggregates must be taken as both a collection at one time and a collection over former and later [moments]; therefore, it is not feasible to posit the continuum of the collection of the aggregates as a person. When the collection is posited as the basis of imputation, the possessors of the collection [that is, the parts] are also posited as the bases of imputation, and therefore both of those [that is, the collection and its parts] are not fit to be a person.

For if—from between the object of observation and the subjective aspect of a consciousness apprehending [an inherently existent] “I”—[the aggre-gates] were the object of observation, they would have to be posited as the self.

For when another school tries to prove that the mental consciousness is the self, Bhā-vaviveka responds that they are proving what is already established for him: This is a proof of what is already established [for me] since we also actually impute the term “self ” to [the mental] consciousness conventionally. Because [the mental] consciousness takes rebirth, it is called the self. In his Great Exposition of Tenets, Jam-yang-shay-pa says that this statement indicates that for Bhāvaviveka the collection is the basis of designation and thus is the phenomenon imputed. In his Great Exposition of the Middle (475b.1-475b.3) he takes it slightly differ-ently, saying that in this passage Bhāvaviveka posits consciousness as the self that con-tinuously takes rebirth and indicates (1) that the mere collection of the body and senses is the self and (2) that the five aggregates—the body and so forth—are the basis of des-ignation of that self, just as, for example, (1) the mere collection of the parts of a char-iot is the chariot and (2) its parts are the basis of designation. Jam-yang-shay-pa points out that Bhāvaviveka (P5256, vol. 96, 36.4.6) cites this very sūtra passage as support for his position: It is said [in sūtra], “Just as one thinks ‘chariot,’ for example, with respect to a collection of parts, so in dependence on the aggregates ‘sentient being’ is im-puted conventionally.” a Stanza VI.132; P5262, vol. 98, 104.2.6; Toh. 3861, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 210b.5; La Vallée Pous-sin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 254.18-255.2; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 12 (1911): 301. b This passage is quoted in Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on the “Supplement,” P5263, vol. 98, 142.4.8, commenting on VI.126cd and also in Tsong-kha-pa’s Illumination, P6143, vol. 154, 84.3.7; La Vallée Poussin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 244.16-244.18; La Vallée Poussin, “In-troduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 12 (1911): 291."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight viewing the aggregates must be explained as referring to observing the self that is imputed toa the aggregates.

Delineating “I” as not inherently existent Concerning this, the first of the four essentials is to identify the mode of apprehending a self of persons through analyzing your own contin-uum.c It was explained earlier.d The second essential is the decision that if a person is inherently established, it must be established as either one entity with or a               a As here, Tsong-kha-pa himself does not always say “imputed in dependence upon”; however, this is taken to be the meaning of “imputed to.” b The outline (416.3) mistakenly reads “four.” c About Tsong-kha-pa’s presentation of the four essentials here in the Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path, which is also called the Small Exposition of the Stages of the Path, Jang-kya’s Presentations of Tenets says: The lack of being one or many is applied to both selflessnesses. The extensive teaching of the reasoning that is the lack of being one or many by way of an analysis of four essentials set forth in Tsong-kha-pa’s Small Exposition of the Stages of the Path is based on the eighteenth chapter of Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle. It is said that this chapter teaches the meanings of all the other twenty-six chapters of Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle, arranged in stages of practice; hence, [Tsong-kha-pa’s teaching of the four essentials] in this way is very important. See Jeffrey Hopkins, Emptiness Yoga (Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, 1987), 382.

It is established through experience that when “pot and pillar,” for instance, are positively set off as plural,a it is eliminated that they are single.b And when “pot,” for instance, is positively set off as single, it is eliminated that it is plural. Hence, there is no third category that is neither one nor many;c thereby, it is deter-mined that something that is not one entity or different entities does not occur. The third essential is to see the damage to [the position that] a per-son and the aggregates are one inherently established entity. The fourth essential is to see well the damage [to the position that] those two are inherently different. When in that way the four essentials are complete, then the pure view realizing the suchness that is the selfless-ness of a person is generated. Concerning that, if the two—the self and the aggregates—are one inherently established entity, from among three fallacies the first dam-age to this position is that the assertion of a self [or person] would be senseless. If the sameness of entity of those two were inherently estab-lished, then they would become an utterly indivisible one. This is be-cause if a sameness of entity were ultimately established, then to what-ever awareness those two appeared, they would necessarily not appear to be different. The reason for this is that although among falsities—conventionalities—it is not contradictory for the mode of appearance and mode of being to be in disagreement, such is necessarily contradic-tory in what is truly established because the mode of being of what truly exists must appear just as it is to any mind to which it appears. The assertion of an inherently established self is for the sake of es-tablishing an assumer and discarder of the aggregates; however, if it is one with the aggregates, those are not feasible. About that, Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle says:d When [you say that] there is no [inherently existent] self [who is the appropriator of the mental and physical aggregates] Separate from the appropriated [aggregates],               a zla bcas literally means having an equivalent, having a mate, and thus not being alone. b zla med literally means not having an equivalent, not having a mate, and thus being alone, matchless. c Or, neither singular nor plural; neither one nor different. d XXVII.5; Toh. 3824, dbu ma, vol. tsa, 18a.1; de Jong, Mūlamadhyamakakārikāḥ, 41: upādānavinirmukto nāsty ātmeti kṛte sati / syād upādānam evātmā nāsti cātmeti vaḥ punaḥ // Brackets are from Four Interwoven Annotations, vol. 2, 628.6.

Just as the aggregates are produced and disintegrate, the self also would be produced and disintegrate because those two are one.a Objection: It is accepted that the self, or person, is produced and dis-integrates each moment. Answer: There is no fault in merely asserting such in conventional terms, but the opponent asserts that persons are established by way of their own character and consequently has to assert that persons are produced and disintegrate by way of their own nature. That has three fallacies, as set out in Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle.’” With respect to the first fallacy, his Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle” says:b Those that are separate by way of their own character Are not feasible to be included in one continuum. Hence, it is not feasible for former and later individuals that are estab-lished by way of their own nature to have the relationship of the later depending on the former. For, since the former and later would be es-tablished as able to set themselves up under their own power, reliance on others would not be suitable. When in that way a sameness of con-tinuum is not feasible, memory of a former life as in “At such-and-such a time in that life I became such-and-such,” is not possible. It is like the fact that when Devadatta remembers a [former] life, he does not think, “I became Yajñadatta,” who [is his contemporary and] has a separate continuum. In our own system, although there is [conventionally existent] dis-integration in each moment, it is not contradictory for former and later to be one continuum. Due to this, memory of lives is feasible. Those who do not understand the meaning of the above think that because in the sets of discoursesc Buddha frequently says, “In the past I became such-and-such [a person],” the two persons—the one after enlightenment and the one at an earlier time—are one. Furthermore, [they think that] it would not be suitable for them to be one if they were compounded phenomena, since they would disintegrate moment by moment, and therefore they say that both are permanent.

To prevent falling to such [a view], when Buddha remembered a life, he spoke of remembering in general, saying “I” without qualifying it with a specific place, time, or nature.b You need to understand well this feature of his mode of remembering [former lives]. The second fallacy [of an inherently produced and disintegrating person] is that actions done would be wasted. The two—the agent of the action and the experiencer of the effect—could not be included within the single substratum of the “mere “I” .” The [third] fallacy is that one would meet with [the effects of ] ac-tions not done [by oneself ]. This is the greatly absurd consequence that even all the effects of actions accumulated by another [person] of a dif-ferent continuum would have to be experienced by [the person of ] this continuum. These two fallacies are incurred by way of the essential—as in the above explanation of Chandrakīrti’s Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle”—that if a person is established inherently, former and later moments are not suitable to be the same continuum.

The definition rūpaṇa is rendered by de Jong in Cinq chapitres de la Prasannapadā, 4, as “le pouvoir d’être brisé,” “capable of being broken.” Ajitamitra explains the term this way in his commentary on Nāgārjuna’s Precious Garland (P5659, vol. 129, notation lost). Therefore, it might be that the translators into Tibetan were aware of both meanings and chose “suitability as form” here. In oral commentary, Lati Rinbochay explained that “capable of being broken” is not appropriate as a definition of form at least in those schools that assert partless particles as these cannot be broken down either physically or mentally. Perhaps this is the rea-son why the translation as “that which is suitable as form,” meaning whatever one points to when asked what form is, was preferred. Still, the late Geshe Gedün Lodrö opined that partless particles could not be further reduced without disappearing, and thus indicated that they could be broken; therefore, if we take their physical disappear-ance as their susceptibility to being broken, this reading of rūpaṇa as “that which is susceptible to being broken” would be an appropriate definition of form. b Stanza XXVII.7; Toh. 3824, dbu ma, vol. tsa, 18a.2; de Jong, Mūlamadhyamakakārikāḥ, 41: anyaḥ punar upādānād ātmā naivopapadyate / gṛhyeta hy anupādāno yady anyo na ca gṛhyate //.

There are two meanings of such teachings of being like an illusion. In the description of, for instance, an ultimate truth as being like an illusion, it is taken [as meaning] that although [an ultimate truth, that is, an emptiness,] is established as merely existent, truth [that is, its true existence] is negated.b [The second] is an illusory-like appearance in which [an object] appears while being empty [of inherent existence]. Between these two, here [being like an illusion refers to] the latter. Concerning this, two [factors]—appearance of something and emp-tiness of existing the way it appears—are needed. Moreover, if [objects seem] to be utterly non-existent even as mere appearances, like the horn of a rabbit or the child of a barren woman, and do not dawn as appearing yet empty of existing the way they appear, the meaning of illusory-like appearance has not dawned to the mind. Therefore, the way to know other phenomena as like the example of an illusion is as follows. For example, the illusions emanated [or con-jured] by a magician are from the start empty of being horses and ele-phants, but appearances as horses and elephants undeniably dawn; and likewise you should know that phenomena, persons and so forth, also are from the start empty of inherent existence—that is, of being estab-lished by way of their own nature right with the object—but it is unde-niable that they appear as if established that way.

Because all actions, agents, and objects are feasible, this is not an annihilatory emptiness. Also, because phenomena, which from the primordial start have been empty in this way, are just being known as empty, this is also not a mentally fabricated emptiness.

Objection: If this ascertainment that reflections and so forth are empty of what they appear to be is a realization of their absence of in-herent existence, then the direct perceptions of common beings would realize the absence of inherent existence [since they know, for in-stance, that that reflection of a face is empty of being an actual face], and due to that, they would be Superiors.a If the ascertainment that reflections and so forth are empty of what they appear to be is not a realization of their absence of inherent existence, how could these be suitable as examples of the absence of inherent existence? Answer: Concerning this, Āryadeva’s Four Hundred says:b Whoever is a viewerc of one thing [as without inherent exis-tence] Is described as a viewer of all [as without inherent existence. The reason for this is] that that which is the emptiness [of in-herent existence] of one [thing] Is the emptiness [of inherent existence] of all [things]. He explains that a viewer, or realizer, of the emptiness of one thing also can realize the emptiness of other things. However, the realization that a reflection of a face is empty of a face does not do any damage to the object of a [consciousness] apprehending true existence, that is to say, which apprehends a reflection to be established by way of its own na-ture. Furthermore, without rejecting the object of that apprehension, the emptiness of inherent establishment of the reflection is not real-ized. Hence, that awareness [realizing that a reflection of a face is empty of a face] does not realize the suchness of the reflection. Due to this, though one realizes magical illusions to be empty of beings horses               a Superiors (’phags pa, āryan) are those who have realized emptiness directly. b VIII.16; Toh. 3846, dbu ma, vol. tsha, 9b.6; Lang, Āryadeva’s Catuḥśataka, 82: bhāvasyai-kasya yo draṣṭā draṣṭā sarvasya sa smṛtaḥ / ekasya śūnyatā yaiva saiva sarvasya śūnyatā //.

If an object is truly established, it is not suitable for it to appear to a mind in any way other than just what its mode of subsistence is; therefore, that these [reflections and magical illusions] are empty of an inherent nature in the sense of being established by way of their own nature is proven through showing the contradiction in those two [that is, being truly established and appearing to be something they are not].

Therefore, even the dawning of shimmering ephemeral ap-pearances, induced by realizing those, is not at all the meaning of being like an illusion. Therefore, it is not difficult, when analyzing with reasoning to think, “Persons and so forth do not in the least have an objective mode of abidinga which is their being established by way of their own na-ture,” and in dependence on this, for these appearances to shine forth ephemerally.b Such happens to all who are interested in Middle Way tenets and have heard a few scattered doctrines teaching the mode of the absence of inherent existence. However, the difficult point is that you must, from the depths, be able to induce ascertainment with re-spect to the negation, without residue, of an inherent nature—establishment by way of [the object’s] own nature—and be able to posit those very persons and so forth, lacking inherent existence, as the ac-cumulators of actions, experiencers of effects, and so forth. A compos-ite of these two hardly occurs; hence, the Middle Way view is very diffi-cult to find. Therefore, it is said that because production and so forth, when analyzed with the reasoning analyzing suchness, are not found, inher-ently existent production and so forth are refuted, but all whatsoever production, cessation, and so forth are not refuted, and if they were refuted, there would be the fallacy that [everything] would be like the horns of a rabbit or the child of a barren woman, empty of all perform-ance of function, and all dependently arisen agents, actions, and objects would not be feasible within the mere illusory-like appearance that is left over.

In that way, through analyzing phenomena frequently with the reasoning analyzing whether they are established by way of their own nature or not, strong ascertainment with respect to the absence of in-herent existence is generated, and when, after that, one views the dawning of appearances, they dawn as like illusions. There is no sepa-rate way of delineating illusory-like emptiness.

They should be done within this. Through having become proficient in this, even by merely becoming mindful of the view those will dawn as like illusions. To describe how to seek that ascertainment in a way easy to under-stand: • As explained earlier, cause the generality of the object of negation by reasoning to appear well, and contemplating well inherent exis-tence as it is superimposed by the ignorance in your own contin-uum, identify it. • Then, with particular emphasis contemplate the fact that if such inherent establishment exists, it does not pass beyond oneness and difference, and with particular emphasis contemplate the mode of the presence of damage to assertions [of the self and aggregates] as either one or different, inducing ascertainment seeing the damage. • Finally, make firm the ascertainment thinking, “A person does not in the least have inherent establishment.” Frequently train this way in the factor of emptiness.

From that discussion and the source materials cited, it is clear that Tibetan and Indian translators of Sanskrit into Tibetan adopted a code for handling the three-part discussion of the formation of pratītyasamutpāda: prati = rten cing i or itya = ’brel bar samutpāda = ’byung ba Their overriding concern was with having a three-part translation equivalent that makes sense in Tibetan when the parts are put together. As a result, the individual equivalents often make no sense when associated with the various explanations of the formation of the term by Indian scholars. Some Tibetan scholars mistakenly claim that rten cing and ’brel bar have different meanings; however, since Chandrakīrti says that prati (rten cing), which itself means prāpti (phrad pa), modifies the meaning of itya (’brel ba) into meaning prāpti (phrad pa), the two words come to have just one meaning, and thus the two were separated out in Tibetan merely in order to convey the discussion of the meaning of the individual parts. (An alternative to the three-part code would have been to transliterate the indi-vidual parts into Tibetan script rather than attempt to translate each part, but this avenue was not chosen.) In Chandrakīrti’s explanation, pratītya has just one meaning: a continuative meaning “having depended.” In Tibetan this is rten nas as in the commonly used rten nas ’byung ba or rten in rten ’byung. Strictly speaking, therefore, in the Consequence School rten nas ’byung ba or rten ’byung is the most appropriate general term, with rten cing ’brel bar ’byung ba suitable only as a code equivalent for the three-part discussion. rten ’brel is a common usage that is neither. The point is that all three—rten nas ’byung ba, rten ’byung, and rten cing ’brel bar ’byung ba—have the same meaning, dependent-arising. b blo gros rgya mtshos zhus pa’i mdo, sāgaramatiparipṛcchāsūtra; Toh. 152, mdo sde, vol. pha, 48a.4. c klu’i rgyal po ma dros pas zhus pa’i mdo, anavataptanāgarājaparipṛcchāsūtra; Toh. 156, mdo sde, vol. pha, , 224a.1; cited in Prasannapadā, in commentary on stanza XIII.2; Toh. 3860, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 81b.3-81b.4; La Vallée Poussin, Mūlamadhyamakakārikās (Mādhyamikasū-tras) de Nāgārjuna avec la Prasannapadā, 239.10-239.13; J.W. de Jong, “Text-critical Notes on the Prasannapadā,” Indo-Iranian Journal 20, nos. 1/2 (1978): 55: yaḥ pratyayair jāyati sa hy ajāto na tasya utpādu svabhāvato sti / yaḥ pratyayādhīnu sa śūnyu ukto yaḥ śūnyatāṃ jānāti sā prasamanta iti //.

Therefore, although observed to exist, they have no in-herently existent production. When those are not differentiated, you do not pass beyond the two extremes of superimposition and deprecation since then once a thing exists, it exists by way of its own nature, and once something does not exist by way of its own nature, it is totally non-existent.

The antas mentioned this way [in Vasubandhu’s text] are also indeed accepted in our own system, but with respect to the anta (extreme) that is a place of going wrong with respect to the view, as in “devoid of the extremes,” Kamalashīla’s Illumination of the Middle says:c If in the middle there were any ultimate nature of inherent ex-istence of the mind,d then since it had that, how could even manifest adherences to “permanence” and “impermanence” with regard to it be extremes (anta)? It is not reasonable to say that proper mental application in accordance with the such-ness of things is a situation of falling [to an extreme (anta)]. As he says, mental application in accordance with how an object actu-ally is, is not a situation of falling [to an extreme].

If the assertion of these as truly ex-istent could not be refuted by this reasoned analysis, then since it would also be the same in all respects with regard to compounded phe-nomena, true existence could not even in the least be refuted. Objection: The meaning of the statement that compounded phe-nomena are empty of their own inherently existent entity is that those phenomena do not have their own entities, whereby this is an annihila-tory emptiness. However, since thusness has its own entity, it truly ex-ists. Answer: [The first part of that assertion] is the final place of going wrong with respect to delineating compounded phenomena as empty of inherent establishment, a view deprecating the dependent-arising of compounded phenomena. The latter [part of that assertion] is an awful view of permanence superimposing true existence on whatever has its own entity. Therefore, [the proponents of this] are wrongly perspected with respect to the correct meaning of emptiness. If [an object’s] emptiness of its own inherently established entity [meant that] it did not exist within itself, then since not existing within itself [means] that existence would not occur anywhere, holders of the thesis that some phenomena truly exist as well as the scriptures and reasonings proving this, and so forth, would not be established bases [that is, would not exist] due to being empty of their own inherently established entity.

Therefore, the subjects, uncompounded phenomena, are not inherently established because of being related with their objects of attainment, their definitions, their positers, and so forth. There is entailment [that if something is related with its objects of attainment, its definition, its positers, and so forth, it is necessarily not inherently established] because since reliance on something else is unsuitable in that which is truly established—that is, inher-ently established—relationship cannot be posited [with respect to it]. The above reason [—that it is established that uncompounded phenom-ena are related with objects of attainment, definitions, positers, and so forth—] is confirmed because if these were unrelated with those, one could not avoid [the problem] that all unrelated things would be definition and de-finiendum."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight phenomena truly exista is an unexamined propounding of whatever appears to mind.

Basis of Division of the Two Truths Presentation of obscurational truths and ultimate truths This section has four parts: the basis of division of the two truths, num-ber of divisions, meaning of dividing them that way, and meaning of the individual divisions. Basis of division of the two truths With respect to the basis of division of the two truths there are many modes of assertion among earlier [scholars];a however, here objects of               a Jam-yang-shay-pa’s Great Exposition of Tenets (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 894-895) gives a clear presentation of these: There are many systems of assertion with regard to the basis of division of the two truths—that is, what is divided into the two truths. These incorrect systems hold that: 1. Mere appearances are the basis of division of the two truths because ul-timate truths are not objects of knowledge. 2. The entities of form through to omniscience are the basis of division be-cause Chandrakīrti explains that phenomena have two entities. 3. Non-superimpositional objects are the basis of division. 4. Non-investigated and non-analyzed objects of knowledge are the basis of division. 5. Truths are the basis of division, and when truths are divided, there are two, obscurational truths and ultimate truths. 6. There is no necessity for a basis of division, but there is much to be said about the two truths that are the divisions. Those are not correct because: 1. If [according to you] ultimate truths do not exist [because they are not objects of knowledge, and hence not existents]: • It [absurdly] follows that the final mode of subsistence of forms and so forth does not exist. • It [absurdly] follows that because what is seen now is the final mode of subsistence, all sentient beings are already liberated. and so forth. 2. Just as the two truths are not among the entities of a form, so it is [for all phenomena] through to omniscience. [If the two truths were both in-cluded within, for instance, form, then the ultimate truth of a form, which is its emptiness, would be a form, due to which emptiness ab-surdly would not be an uncompounded phenomenon which it actually is.] 3. Existing superimpositional systems [such as the Sāṃkhya system] are obscurational truths.

If the base of division and the mode of division are not known, then [the two truths] become attributes without a substratum... Therefore, that objects of knowledge are the basis of division [of the two truths] is proved by: • scripture: The Meeting of the Father and Son Sūtra which says, “Further-more, objects of knowledge [that is, objects to be known] are exhausted as these two truths, obscurational and ultimate.” [See the following note.] • and reasoning: [The two truths] are objects of two types of awareness—that is, objects to be known and objects of analysis by those two types of awareness. a bslab pa kun las btus pa, śikṣāsamuccaya; Toh. 3940, vol. khi, 142b.2; Sanskrit in Bendall, Çikshāsamuccaya, 256: etāvaccaitat jñeyam / yaduta saṃvṛtiḥ paramārthaśca /.

Furthermore, objects of knowledge are exhausted as these obscura-tional truths and ultimate truths.

The addition does indeed seem strained, but the sūtra itself, just above, has spoken about both truths. b Or, “those that are to be known,” that is to say, what is to be known by those seeking liberation and omniscience.

That the reason is so follows because the two, truth and falsity, are explicitly contradictory in the sense of mutual ex-clusion. That this is so follows because the two, deceptive and non-deceptive, are such. That this is so follows because when a particular basis is positively included as being non-deceptive, it is eliminated that that basis is deceptive, and when it is eliminated that a particular basis is non-deceptive, it is posi-tively included that it is deceptive. The reason for this is that the meaning of true and false on this occasion refers to deceptiveness and non-deceptiveness. d For Jam-yang-shay-pa’s exposition of four positions on this topic, see Hopkins, Maps"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight Pot and woolen cloth, for instance, are different entities.a Prod-uct and impermanent thing, for instance, are one entity and different isolates.b In these two cases, the two that are different are both effective things; however, in cases of difference when either is a non-effective thing [that is, a permanent phenome-non] they have a difference that [merely] negates sameness.c Among these three [modes of ] difference, the two truths are different in the sense of negating sameness.

Obscurational Truths Meaning of the individual divisions This section has three parts: obscurational truths, ultimate truths, and indicating the definiteness of the number of the truths as two. Obscurational truths This section has three parts: the meanings of the terms saṃvṛti (kun rdzob) and satya (bden pa), definition of an obscurational truth, and divi-sions of conventionalities. Meanings of the terms saṃvṛti (kun rdzob) and satya (bden pa) Chandrakīrti’s Clear Wordsa describes three [meanings] for saṃvṛti—(1) obstructing suchness,b (2) mutually dependent objects,c and (3) worldly conventions.d Since he explains the last as having the character of ob-ject of expression and means of expression, knower and object of knowledge, and so forth, it is not just subjective conventions—consciousnesses and expressions—[but also objects known and objects expressed]. Nevertheless, [this is just an etymology and not a definition since] not all whatsoever objects of knowledge and objects of expres-sion should be held to be obscurational truths [because an emptiness is an object of knowledge and object of expression but is an ultimate truth].e               a La Vallée Poussin, Mūlamadhyamakakārikās (Mādhyamikasūtras) de Nāgārjuna avec la Prasannapadā, 492.11-492.12. b de kho na nyid la sgrib pa, tattvāvacchādana. c phan tshun brten pa, parasparasaṃbhavana. d ’jig rten gyi tha snyad, lokavyavahāra. e Jam-yang-shay-pa’s Great Exposition of Tenets (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 904-905) says: In the Sanskrit original of ’jig rten kun rdzob bden pa (worldly obscurational truth) lokasaṃvṛtisatya: • Loka (’jig rten; world) on this occasion is taken to be persons and also du-alistic awarenesses...A person imputed in dependence on the aggregates is called “world”...but it is not suitable to take all occurrences of “world” as referring to common beings—it refers to both common beings and Su-periors [depending on context]...Still, “world” on this occasion is not just persons because there are many instances of its referring to dualistic consciousness...acting in both erroneous and non-erroneous ways with regard to conventionalities..."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight The saṃvṛti that is the obscuring consciousness with respect to which forms and so forth are posited as truths [in the sense that igno-rance takes them to exist the way they appear to be inherently exis-tent] is the first among the three [meanings]. It is the ignorance super-imposing on phenomena the existence of their own inherently estab-lished entity, whereas they do not have such.a This is because: • true establishment does not occur in objects, and therefore the pos-iting of [objects that appear to be truly existent] as truths is in the perspective of an awareness, and • there is no positing [of objects that appear to be truly existent] as truths in the perspective of a mind that is not an apprehender of true existence. In that way moreover, Chandrakīrti’s Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s)                                 • In general, saṃvṛti is used in many ways, but on this occasion saṃvṛti is obscurational (kun rdzob), or samantavṛti [meaning] concealing all (kun sgrib), or concealing reality (yang dag sgrib), that is to say, ignorance; “ob-scurational truths” (kun rdzob bden pa) are so called since they are true in the perspective of ignorance...Hence, saṃvṛti is used for “concealing real-ity” (yang dag sgrib), “concealing all” (kun sgrib), and “concealing the na-ture” (rang bzhin sgrib)...  Saṃvṛti also means mutual dependence—falsity...[Because they are mutually dependent, that they have a self-instituting nature is untrue.] Hence, the world’s mutual dependence is called saṃvṛti, and “relative truths” (kun rdzob bden pa, saṃvṛtisatya) are so called since they exist just in mutual dependence.  In addition, saṃvṛti means terminology (brda), or conventions (tha snyad), which include both objects expressed and means of expression, objects known and consciousnesses, and so forth...Because the world’s objects expressed and means of expression and the world’s objects known and consciousnesses are the world’s terminology, or conventions, they are called “conventional” (saṃvṛti); “conventional truths” (kun rdzob bden pa, saṃvṛtisatya) are so called since their mode of appearance and mode of abiding accord with the world’s terminology, or conven-tions. a Nga-wang-pel-den (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 904) describes how conventionali-ties are falsities: Ultimate truths necessarily are established in accordance with how they ap-pear to the awarenesses to which they clearly appear. Thus, obscurational truths are necessarily falsities. The meaning of falsity is “deceptive,” and the meaning of deceptive is “discordance between the mode of appearance and the mode of abiding.” [This conflict] is taken to be that although they ap-pear—to the awarenesses to which they clearly appear—to be truly estab-lished, they are without true establishment."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"   Obscurational   Truths   111   “Treatise on the Middle” (see also Illumination, 235) says:a The Subduer said that because bewilderment [that is, the ap-prehension of inherent existence] obscures [direct percep-tion of ] the nature [of the mode of subsistence of phenom-ena], [This ignorance] is all-obscuring (kun rdzob)b and he said that those fabrications appearing To be true due to this [ignorance] are obscurational truths (kun rdzob bden) [because of being true in the perspective of the obscurational apprehension of inherent existence].

To childish [com-mon beings] these are deceptive, but to the others [that is, to the Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas described above] they are mere conventionalitiesa due to being depend-ent-arisings, like a magician’s illusions and so forth [appearing to truly exist while not truly existing the way they appear]. This passage does not indicate (1) that the positing of obscurational truths as existent is a positing of their existence by ignorance or (2) that obscurational truths are not posited in the perspective of Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have abandoned afflictive ig-norance. The reasons for the first point are: because, as explained before, afflictive ignorance is a con-sciousness apprehending true existence, due to which the ob-ject apprehended by it does not exist even in conventional terms, and because whatever is an obscurational truth neces-sarily exists in conventional terms. Therefore, whatever is the conventionality (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) that is the ground from which phenomena are posited as existing convention-allyb (kun rdzob tu yod pa, saṃvṛtisat) must be something that is not the afflictive ignorance that is taken as the obscurer (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) [in “obscurational truth” (kun rdzob bden pa, saṃvṛtisatya)]. The reason for the second point is: Chandrakīrti is establishing that those who have abandoned the obscurer, afflictive ignorance, do not have the obscurer—a consciousness adhering to true existence—in the perspective of which [objects appearing to exist inherently] are posited as truths, and, therefore, compositional phenomena are not truths for them. He is not establishing that compositional phenomena are not obscurational truths.c Consequently, Chandrakīrti’s statement that compositional phenomena are mere conventionalities for them means that, between convention-ality and truth, those are not positable as truths for them, and there-fore the term “mere” [in “mere conventionalities”] eliminates truth,               a Or, “mere fraudulences” (kun rdzob tsam, saṃvṛtimātra). b kun rdzob tu yod par ’jog sa’i kun rdzob. c Even for Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have abandoned afflictive ignorance and who see compositional phenomena as like the existence of reflections and so forth, compositional phenomena are obscurational truths, since they know that others take them to be truths and since these exist but are not ultimate truths."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"   Obscurational   Truths   113   not obscurational truth. Hence, Chandrakīrti’s thought in speaking of the two—mere conventionality and obscurational truth—should be un-derstood in that way. Chandrakīrti’s Clear Words says,a “Truths for a worldly obscurer are worldly obscurational truths.”b With respect to this, Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’” says:c Those which are perceived as true by the obscurer and are in-dividually perceived as having inherent existence, whereas they do not, are truths for a worldly erroneous obscurer; hence, they are worldly obscurational truths. Therefore, the statement in Chandrakīrti’s Clear Words should be taken in accordance with this clear description of truths in the perspective of that obscurer which is the ignorance described earlier, and it should not be taken as true establishment in conventional terms: • because otherwise it would contradict the system of the non-occurrence of establishment by way of [the object’s] own character even in conventional terms,d and • because the refutation of true establishment and the proof of the absence of true existence are done in conventional terms.

Tsong-kha-pa’s concern is that Chandrakīrti’s statement might be mistaken to mean that whatever ignorance takes to be truly established is an obscurational truth or that obscurational truths are truly established conventionally. He addresses these mistakes in what follows. c Commenting on VI.28; Toh. 3862, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 254b.5-254b.6; La Vallée Poussin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 107.8-107.10; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 11 (1910): 304.

Answer: If that which is merely true in the perspective of the ob-scurer—a consciousness apprehending true existence—were posited as an obscurational truth, such would indeed be so, but that is not pro-pounded. This is merely an explanation of the obscurer with respect to which the truths of “obscurational truths” are truths, and the mode of truth in its perspective.a Definition of obscurational truth Each of these external and internal things has two natures, ultimate and conventional. If this is illustrated with, for instance, a sprout, there is the nature of a sprout found by a rational consciousness perceiving the meaning of suchness, a real object of knowledge, and there is the nature of a sprout found by a conventional consciousness comprehend-ing a deceptive object, a false object of knowledge. The former of those is the nature of the sprout’s ultimate truth; the latter is the nature of the sprout’s obscurational truth. In that way also Chandrakīrti’s Sup-plement to (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle” (see also Illumination, 217 and 219) says:b [Buddha] said that all things have two natures, Those found by perceptions of the real and of the false— Objects of perceptions of reality are suchnesses, [And] objects of perceptions of the false are obscurational truths. This indicates that with regard to the natures of a sprout there are two—the natures of the two truths—and that the ultimate is found by the former consciousness, whereas the conventional is found by the latter consciousness. It does not indicate that one nature of a sprout itself is the two truths in relation to the former and latter conscious-nesses.c Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s)               a It is not a complete definition of obscurational truth, for which see the next section. b VI.23; Toh. 3861, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 205a.5-205a.6; La Vallée Poussin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 102.8-102.11; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 11 (1910): 299.

In order to ascertain an illustration [of an obscurational truth], such as a pot, as a false object of knowledge, a deceptive object, it is necessary to gain the view that—with respect to that substratum—causes disbeliefc in the conceived object of the ap-prehension of true existence through a rational consciousness. For without having refuted trueness through reasoning, falsity cannot be established by valid cognition. Although pots, woolen cloth, and so forth are obscurational truths, it is not necessary—when they are established by an awareness [as ex-isting]—that the meaning of obscurational truth be established by the awareness.d It is like the fact that although pots, woolen cloth, and so forth are illusory-like appearances seeming to be inherently existent whereas they are not, an awareness that establishes them [as existing] does not have to establish the meaning of being illusory-like. Therefore, it is not feasible to propound that in this system pots, woolen cloth, and so forth are posited as obscurational truths in rela-tion to the perspective of a consciousness of a common being who does not have the Middle Way view and that the same are posited as ulti-mate truths in relation to a Superior. For that would be propounded opposite to what Chandrakīrti says in his Commentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’” (see also Illumination, 253):e Regarding this, those which are ultimates for common beings are mere conventionalities for Superiors acting on objects               a Commenting on VI.23; Toh. 3862, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 253a.6; La Vallée Poussin, Madhya-makāvatāra, 102.14-102.15; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 11 (1910): 300.

That which is the nature of those [ob-jects]—emptiness—is the ultimate for them.

Hence, in relation to the perspective of these consciousnesses of those [common beings], pots and so forth are ultimately established and are not conventional objects. Pots and so forth—the bases that for them are ultimately established—are conventionalities in relation to the percep-tion by the pristine wisdom in the continuum of a Superior compre-hending illusory-like appearance. In relation to this consciousness, these cannot be posited as true, whereby they are mere conventionali-ties. This is what Chandrakīrti is saying. Nevertheless, since he says that their nature is the ultimate truth, a differentiation should be made, saying, “Pots and so forth are conven-tionalities, and their nature is the ultimate of Superiors.” However, it should not be propounded that pots and so forth are ultimates for Su-periors: • because their rational consciousnesses seeing the meaning of real-ity do not find pots and so forth, and • because that which is found by a rational consciousness seeing the meaning of reality is said to be the meaning of an ultimate truth.

Those harming the physical sense powers are two types: those in which the cause of error is in-ternal and those in which it is external. The first are, for example, opthoma-lia, jaundice, and eating dadhura [a poison]. External causes of mistake are mirrors; a sound in an empty cave; in the summer the contact of sunlight with pale yellow sand; medicines and spells used by a magician; and so forth. The way these generate mistaken consciousnesses is as follows. Op-thomalia acts as the cause of a mistaken sense consciousness seeing falling hairs; jaundice acts as the cause of a mistaken sense consciousness seeing a white conch shell as yellow; eating dadhura acts as the cause of a mistaken sense consciousness to which the ground appears gold; the coming together of a mirror and a face acts as the cause of a mistaken sense consciousness to which the reflection of a face within the mirror appears to be a face; a sound in an empty cave acts as the cause of a mistaken sense consciousness to which an echo appears to be an expressive sound; the contact of summer sunlight and the pale yellow sand acts as the cause of a mistaken sense consciousness to which a mirage appears to be water; and the medicines and mantras used by a magician act as causes of a mistaken sense consciousness to which peb-bles and twigs appear to be horses and elephants. The second, causes of mistake harming the mental sense power, are wrong tenets, counterfeit reasons, sleep, and so forth. As to how they gener-ate error, wrong tenets and counterfeit reasons act as the cause of mistaken mental consciousnesses apprehending the general principal (spyi’i gtso bo, sāmānya-pradhāna) [of the Sāṃkhya system] and so forth to be existent; sleep acts as the cause of a mistaken mental consciousness apprehending the ap-pearance of an elephant in a dream as an elephant. a ’phags pa’i gzigs pa’i rjes su ’brang ba’i rigs shes.

Proponents of the Middle themselves also assert such real and unreal [conven-tionalities relative to worldly valid cognition], but they conventionally do not assert the former type of real [conventionalities relative to a rational con-sciousness] in their own system...Therefore: • The worldly perspective in “existing conventionally,” the worldly per-spective in “existing in the world’s conventions,” the convention in “conventional truth,” and the noble [or superior] in “noble truth” are conventional valid cognitions. • The worldly perspective in [Chandrakīrti’s statement about real conven-tionalities] “They are true in just the world,” is an innate ordinary [con-sciousness]. • The obscurational [consciousness] (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) in the perspective of which forms and so forth are posited as true must be ignorance.

On this occasion: 1. “object” (don, artha) does not mean purpose but means the object known, analyzed, and found by pristine wisdom. 2. Because of being both such an object and the supreme, or ultimate, of objects, it is ultimate. 3. It is called “truth” since it does not deceive trainees [by] not abiding the way it appears or since the mode of appearance and the mode of abiding are concordant—not being discordant like false conventionalities. h Nga-wang-pel-den’s Annotations for (Jam-yang-shay-pa’s) “Great Exposition of Tenets”"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight Commentary on (Nāgārjuna’s) “Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning” says that an ul-timate truth is merely posited as existing through the force of worldly conventions.a Therefore, the meanings of the term “truth” differ in the two: • in “obscurational truth,” “truth” [means] “truth for a conscious-ness apprehending true existence,” and • in “ultimate truth,” [“truth” means non-deceptive]. Explaining the definition of ultimate truth This section has two parts: actual definition of ultimate truth and dis-pelling objections. Actual definition of ultimate truth The definition of ultimate truth is that given in Chandrakīrti’s Supple-mentb (see also Illumination, 217 and 219) as explained earlier (114)c—that which is found by a perception of a real object of knowledge. Chandrakīrti’s commentary on that says:d Concerning that, with respect to the ultimate its own entitye is found through being the object of the specific pristine wisdom                                 (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 904) expands on Tsong-kha-pa’s meaning: Ultimate truths necessarily are established in accordance with how they ap-pear to the awarenesses to which they clearly appear. Thus, obscurational truths are necessarily falsities. The meaning of falsity is “deceptive,” and the meaning of deceptive is “discordance between the mode of appearance and the mode of abiding.” [This conflict] is taken to be that although they ap-pear—to the awarenesses to which they clearly appear—to be truly estab-lished, they are without true establishment. a In his Commentary on (Nāgārjuna’s) “Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning,” commenting on stanza 5cd; Toh. 3864, dbu ma, vol. ya, 7b.6; Scherrer-Schaub, Yuktiṣaṣṭikāvṛtti, 36. b VI.23. c The complete stanza is: [Buddha] said that all things have two natures, Those found by perceptions of the real and of the false— That objects of perceptions of reality are suchnesses, [And] that objects of perceptions of the false are obscurational truths.

His saying that it is found by the uncontaminated pristine wisdom comprehending suchness and that it is not established by way of its own nature refutes the proposition that if there is anything found by uncontaminated meditative equipoise, it is truly established. His speak-ing of a “specific pristine wisdom” indicates that what is found by any pristine wisdom of Superiors is not sufficient, but rather what is found by a specific pristine wisdom—the pristine wisdom knowing the mode [of being]—is an ultimate truth. “Found” means “established thus by that consciousness”; it is the same also for conventionalities.a Furthermore, with respect to its way of finding: • When the eyes of one with cataractsb see falling hairs—the               a About the definition of ultimate truth, Jam-yang-shay-pa’s Great Exposition of Tenets (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 902-903) says: An object explicitly found by an awareness, that is, a rational consciousness distinguishing the ultimate—[called] a rational consciousness since it is a logical consciousness—is feasible as [the definition of ] an ultimate truth...This is a general [definition]; it covers all those for whom meditative equipoise and the state subsequent to meditative equipoise have not become one, that is, those at the end of the continuum [of being a sentient being with obstructions yet to overcome] and below. The convention of “finding” does not apply in cases when the aspect of an object does not appear to that awareness; hence, that which is implicitly real-ized is not suitable to be an object found...Since it is explained that the quali-ties of a Buddha’s exalted body, speech, and mind are inconceivable, the idea that whatever is an object found by an omniscient consciousness distinguish-ing a conventionality necessarily is an object found by a rational consciousness distinguishing a conventionality is a fool’s over-extension [of the above, lim-ited definition to include the mode of perception of a Buddha]... Hence, if you wish to include even the separate positing of the two truths by one pristine wisdom [of a Buddha] in which meditative equipoise and the state subsequent to meditative equipoise have become one, then [the defini-tions] should be put together this way: • ultimate truth: object found with respect to which [an awareness] comes to be a rational consciousness distinguishing the ultimate • obscurational truth: object found with respect to which [an awareness] comes to be a rational consciousness distinguishing a conventionality. b rab rib, timira; the term means “dimness” and thus “dim sightedness,” the technical name in English perhaps being “amblyopia.” Since Tsong-kha-pa uses the example of floating hairs, the Tibetan and Sanskrit general terms include a disease resulting in the perception of floaters as if they are external to the eye.

Otherwise, the clause would mean “because the bases of negation must be established as false due to the very fact that the absence of true existence of the substrata—appearances—is not truly established”; in that case the point would be that only by the fact that ultimate truths are not truly existent—that is, falsely estab-lished—can it be said that all bases of negation are falsely established. c Commenting on stanza 5cd; Toh. 3864, dbu ma, vol. ya, 7b.1; Scherrer-Schaub, Yuk-tiṣaṣṭikāvṛtti, 35. d The aggregates are impermanent, miserable, unclean, and non-self.

Consequently, the diverse objects must appear to an exalted knower of the diversity [of phenomena]. Since exalted knowledge without the aspect [of the object appearing] is not this [Con-sequentialist] system, [objects are known by an omniscient conscious-ness] upon the appearance of their aspect. Also, the diversity that are the appearing objects are twofold—(1) the marks and beauties and so forth of a Buddha, which are not polluted by the latencies of ignorance, and (2) impure environments and inhabitants, and so forth, which are polluted by the latencies of ignorance. There is no sense of the vanish-ing of the first of those on the Buddha ground, whereas the second have vanished due to the reversal of their causes on that ground. With respect to the mode of appearance, when the marks and beau-ties of a Buddha appear to persons who have not abandoned ignorance, their appearance as established by way of their own character—despite not being so established—is not by reason of those objects’ having arisen through the force of the latencies of ignorance but is an appear-ance due to the [perceiving] subject’s being polluted by the latencies of                                 two—non-conceptual exalted wisdom and suchness—are undifferentiably merged like water poured into water.

In that way Jñānagarbha’s Differentiation of the Two Truths explains that [this pristine wisdom] vividly perceives directly all the diversity:d An omniscient knower directly perceives All the dependently produced Just as they appear Devoid of the superimposed entity. and he explains that [Buddhas] never rise from the meditative stabiliza-tion in which dualistic appearance has been pacified: Because that which does not see knowers, Objects known, and selfhood has a stable abiding Due to the non-arising of signs, [Buddhas] do not rise [from meditative stabilization].

Its concordance is that by reason of negating conceptualization of really [exis-tent] production and so forth—that is, the proliferations of the apprehension of true existence—it accords with non-conceptual pristine wisdom. He also explains this and the previous two quotes in terms of the object, emptiness: With respect to how to explain the meaning of these passages within applying them to the object, emptiness: this absence of truly established production moreover is called an ultimate concordant with the ultimate due to being free from only a portion of proliferations in the perspective of a conceptual ra-tional consciousness, because freedom from the proliferations of the appre-hension of true existence in its perspective accords only partially with free-dom from the proliferations of dualistic appearance in the perspective of an uncontaminated consciousness. It is not an actual ultimate free from both proliferations in the perspective of a non-conceptual rational consciousness because whatever is an actual ultimate—a rational consciousness—in the per-spective of which an ultimate truth is free from both proliferations must be a rational consciousness in the perspective of which [an ultimate truth] is be-yond both proliferations. a Below (146), Tsong-kha-pa explains that this statement is misread as meaning that a negative of ultimately existent production is a conventionality, whereas he holds that it is an ultimate truth; Tsong-kha-pa asserts that the meaning of this quote is that a nega-tive of ultimately existent production exists conventionally. b rnam grangs pa yin min gyi don dam bden pa; 482.2. c don dam bden pa btags pa ba; 482.3. d kun rdzob bden pa mtshan nyid pa; 482.3."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"   Ultimate   Truths   141   • the non-enumerative ultimate truth cannot be taken as an object of any awareness and therefore is not an object of knowledge.a Since that is not the meaning of those [passages], they are to be ex-plained as follows. Though indeed the object, the noumenon, is to be taken as the ultimate, there are also many descriptions of the subject—the rational consciousness—as an ultimate, as is set forth in: • Jñānagarbha’s Differentiation of the Two Truths:b               a This is not aimed at Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen, since he (below, 298) asserts that the ultimate is an object of knowledge. Jam-yang-shay-pa’s Great Exposition of Tenets (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 908) says: Many earlier Tibetans asserted that: • The emptiness that is a negative of forms’ ultimately existent production and so forth is an enumerative ultimate, an imputed ultimate truth (don dam bden pa btags pa ba), and a fully qualified obscurational truth (kun rdzob bden pa mtshan nyid pa). • The non-enumerative ultimate truth cannot be taken as an object of any awareness and therefore is not an object of knowledge. Those are very incorrect because not only does each ultimate—enumerative and non-enumerative—have, [when taken] as object [from between object and subject], the absence of true existence [which is an ultimate truth and hence not an obscurational truth], but also the enumerative ultimate has, [when taken] as subject [from between object and subject], awarenesses of hearing and thinking, and the non-enumerative ultimate has, as subject, pristine wis-doms of meditative equipoise [which take the absence of true existence as their object, and, therefore, even the non-enumerative ultimate, as object, is an object of knowledge, and thus it is wrong to hold that the non-enumerative ultimate truth cannot be taken as an object of any mind]... Although the absence of ultimately existent production, which is the mode of subsistence, does not have proliferations from its own side, an infer-ence of determinative realization [of the absence of ultimately existent pro-duction] comprehends [the absence of ultimately existent production] to-gether with proliferations of dualistic appearance in the perspective of its ap-pearance factor despite the fact that proliferations have disappeared in the perspective of its ascertainment factor. Hence, since it accords with the ulti-mate that is the object of a Superior’s meditative equipoise, it is called a “con-cordant ultimate.” Since the absence of ultimately existent production is with-out all of the collections of proliferations both in the perspective of the ascer-tainment factor of meditative equipoise and even in the perspective of its ap-pearance factor, it is called an “actual ultimate” or “non-enumerative ulti-mate.” Therefore, how could even the object found by inference—the absence of truly existent production—be a conventionality! b Stanza 4ab; Toh. 3881, dbu ma, vol. sa, 1a.4; Tibetan in Eckel, Jñānagarbha’s Commentary, 156; his English translation is on p. 71.

Production and so forth do not exist for such consciousnesses and in this sense do not exist ultimately.] There are two types of rational consciousnesses: 1. non-conceptual: a Superior’s non-conceptual pristine wisdom of meditative equipoise 2. conceptual: a rational consciousness comprehending suchness in dependence on a reason, and so forth.b The thought of Bhāvaviveka’s Blaze of Reasoningc in describing the ulti-mate as twofold—a non-conceptual pristine wisdom and a wisdom con-cordant with that—and the thought of Kamalashīla’s Illumination of the Middle in describing two ultimates are the same. Therefore, it is not the meaning of those texts that the explanation of two ultimates should be taken as ultimates only in terms of objects and not in terms of subjects. Concerning this, when the first [that is, a Superior’s non-conceptual pristine wisdom of meditative equipoise] understands suchness, it is able to simultaneously eliminate with respect to its ob-ject the proliferations of [the apprehension of ] true [existence] and the proliferations of dualistic appearance; hence, [a Superior’s non-conceptual pristine wisdom of meditative equipoise] is an actual ulti-mate; also, that is the meaning of being “beyond all proliferations” (see the quote on 139).

Thus, an inferential rational con-sciousness itself realizes only the absence of inherent existence, not a combination of appearance and emptiness; later, through its force phenomena dawn as like illusions. It seems to me that it is perhaps in this sense that a combination of appearance and emp-tiness is established through the force of an inferential rational consciousness even though it is not comprehended by an inferential rational consciousness, and therefore Tsong-kha-pa switched from his earlier usage of “comprehended” in the Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path to “established” here in the Medium-Length Exposition."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"144 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight appearance of the absence of the true existence of sprouts and so forth through the appearance of the lack of being a true one or many: • There is no point in proving such [a combination of an object and the appearance of its emptiness] to an intelligent persona who has not eliminated doubt with respect to whether or not those bases [that is, sprouts and so forth] truly exist [in that it will not help in realizing the absence of inherent existence, which has to be done first].

Question: How many [types of ] special insight are there? Answer: Here I will not mainly indicate the special insights of those on high grounds but will predominantly indicate those to be cultivated while a common being. All inclusively, the divisions of the special in-sights to be cultivated while a common being are those of the four na-tures, the three approaches, and the six examinations.

Examination of things is to examine, “This is an internal thing; that is an external thing.” 3. Examination concerning characteristics is twofold—to examine, “This is a specific characteristic; that is a general characteristic,” or shared and unshared.e 4.

Examination concerning reasoningsa is of four types. • The reasoning of dependenceb is [from the viewpoint] that the arising of effects depends on causes and conditions. It is also an examination of the conventional, the ultimate, and their bases [that is, instances,] individually. • The reasoning of performance of functionc is [from the viewpoint] that phenomena perform their respective func-tions, such as fire performing the function of burning. Moreover, one examines, “This is the phenomenon; this is the functioning; this phenomenon performs this function.” • The reasoning of tenable proofd is to prove a meaning without contradicting valid cognition. It is an examination within considering whether or not [the meaning] has valid cognition—direct, inferential, or believable scripture. • The reasoning of naturee is to examine [from the view-point] of (1) natures renowned in the world, such as heat being the nature of fire and moisture being the nature of water, (2) inconceivable natures [such as a Buddha’s placing a world-system in a single hair-pore],f and (3) the subsisting nature [such as phenomena’s emptiness of inherent exis-tence]. It is done by way of believing in them and not con-templating other reasons for their beingg like that.

The thought of these texts is not that first one generates calm abid-ing observing any object of observation but not the meaning of self-lessness, and then the later sustaining [of calm abiding] within observ-ing selflessness is special insight: • because the two—calm abiding and special insight—are not differ-entiated by way of object of observation, and • because Ratnākarashānti’s Quintessential Instructions on the Perfection of Wisdom also explains that first one generates calm abiding within observing suchness—the emptiness of duality of apprehended ob-ject and apprehending subject—and later generates special insight through analytical meditation within observing that same object of observation, and • because the Superior Asaṅga also describes a special insight observ-ing the diversity and says that after having first generated calm abiding, in dependence on it [mundane] special insight is cultivated having the aspect of [viewing the lower level as] gross and [the up-per level as] peaceful, and • because Asaṅga moreover speaks of this [mundane special insight] as a path common to both non-Buddhists and Buddhists, as well as both common beings and Superiors. Therefore, when one who has not earlier achieved calm abiding is newly achieving it, it is to be achieved within setting [the mind] one-pointedly on whatever the object of observation is. Except for this, [calm abiding] is not achievable within analyzing the object of observa-tion in many ways. For if you do it the former way [within setting the mind one-pointedly on any object of observation], you will achieve calm abiding, whereas if you do it the latter way [within analyzing the               a Tibetan and English in Powers, Wisdom of Buddha, 150-153; Tibetan and French in Lamotte, Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, 89-90 and 210. b byang chub sems dpa’i sa, bodhisattvabhūmi; Toh. 4037, sems tsam, vol. dzi."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 Tsong-kha-pa: Supramundane Special Insight object of observation in many ways], achievement is impossible. When one who has first achieved calm abiding does not just extend the conditioning to mere stabilizing meditation as before but performs analytical meditation in which the object appropriate to the occasion—the mode or the diversity—is individually analyzed with wisdom, finally a special one-pointed meditative stabilization can be induced. There-fore, since the former [mode of mere stabilization] cannot induce a very powerful one-pointed meditative stabilization as achieved through analytical meditation, analytical meditation is praised. Just that mode of achievement is how, in dependence on first hav-ing sought calm abiding, to cultivate special insight afterwards. Hence, it is the general reason for there being two different modes of proce-dure in calm abiding and special insight, even though the object of ob-servation—selflessness, for instance—might be the same. In particular, cultivation of special insight having the aspect of grossness/peacefulness—individually analyzing the faults of a lower realm and advantages of an upper realma—and the cultivation of special insight having the aspect of selflessness, in which the meaning of self-lessness is sustained within analysis through the wisdom of individual investigation, necessarily involve generation of strong and steady as-certainment. Consequently, they have great power with respect to abandoning their individual objects of abandonment. Not only is there cultivation of special insight observing the diver-sity that has the aspect of grossness/peacefulness for the sake of aban-doning the manifest afflictive emotions, but also, as is explained in Rat-nākarashānti’s Quintessential Instructions on the Perfection of Wisdom, there is analytical meditation thoroughly differentiating the character of the eighteen constituents.b Therefore, using this as an illustration you should understand that there are other special insights that involve meditation differentiating the objects comprising the diversity. Ratnākarashānti’s Quintessential Instructions on the Perfection of Wis-dom explains that prior to generating calm abiding and special insight               a In brief, about this process, Gedün Lodrö (Calm Abiding and Special Insight, 231) says: For example, someone who is cultivating an actual absorption of the first concentration views the afflictive emotions pertaining to the Desire Realm as gross relative to the afflictive emotions of the Form Realm. The afflictive emotions of the Form Realm are also viewed as peaceful in comparison to those of the Desire Realm; other qualities of the Form Realm are seen as even more peaceful. For a detailed and evocative description of the faults of the Desire Realm drawn from Gedün Lodrö’s book, see the Appendix (363ff.). b These are the six objects, six senses powers, and six consciousnesses."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" Procedures of Special Insight 157 observing the mode [emptiness], calm abiding and special insight on the ground [or level] of yoga observing the diversity is to be generated. However, here according to the assertions of Shāntideva, Kamalashīla, and so forth, first any calm abiding is generated and then special in-sight is generated, and they indicate that this, moreover, is just the special insight observing the mode.a From the viewpoint of which paths of which vehicle, great or small, this is the system Question: From the viewpoint of which vehicles—Great or Small and Sūtra or Mantra—is this the mode of serially generating calm abiding and special insight? Answer: It is common to the two vehicles—that of the Hearers and Solitary Realizers and that of the Perfections—and moreover is com-mon to the four schools of tenets,b and in my Great Exposition of Secret Mantra I have explained that the assertion of the individual tantras and their great commentators is that it is similar also for the three lower tantra sets within the Mantra [Vehicle].c With respect to Highest Yoga [Mantra], Ratnākarashānti’s Quintes-sential Instructions on the Perfection of Wisdomd explains that the three grounds of yoga—observing mind-only, observing suchness, and with-out appearance—taught in the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra:e               a In his 1972 lectures, the Dalai Lama indicated that for those who have attained the stability of calm abiding, except for cultivating special insight observing emptiness, it is not necessary to cultivate special insight observing an upper realm as gross and a lower realm as peaceful. He added that for someone practicing Highest Yoga Tantra, cultiva-tion of mundane special insight would be to stray into a diversionary path in that one would become separated from desire for the attributes of the desire realm, his point being that desire for the attributes of the desire realm is needed for certain levels of the completion stage. b Great Exposition School, Sūtra School, Mind-Only School, and Middle Way School. c For translations of the sections on Action Tantra and Performance Tantra see His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tsong-kha-pa, and Jeffrey Hopkins, Deity Yoga (Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, 1987); for Yoga Tantra see His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Tsong-kha-pa, and Jeffrey Hopkins, Yoga Tantra: Paths to Magical Feats (Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, 2005). d Toh. 4079, sems tsam, vol. hi, 161a.5-161b.1. e Tsong-kha-pa quotes only the first two lines and indicates the rest by “and so forth.” The Sanskrit, in Nanjio’s Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, 298-299, reads: cittamātraṃ samāruhya bāhya-marthaṃ na kalpayet / tathatālambane sthitvā cittamātramatikramet // cittamātramatikramya nirābhāsamatikramet / nirābhāsasthito yogī mahāyānaṃ na paśyate //.

Therefore, he asserts that the way special insight observing the mode [that is, emptiness] is generated in the mental continuum is similar [in Highest Yoga Mantra and in the Perfection Vehicle]. Our own system is as follows: Even in the context of Highest Yoga [Mantra] the system of generating understanding of the view must be done in accordance with what occurs in the Middle Way texts. With respect to how it is sustained, on some occasions during states subse-quent to meditative equipoise on the stages of generation and comple-tion, one takes suchness to mind within analyzing it, but when those on the stage of completion who have attained the capacity to put penetra-tive focus on essential points in the body sustain suchness in medita-tive equipoise, although they definitely must meditate within setting [the mind] in the context of the view, they do not perform the analyti-cal meditation of special insight as it occurs in other texts. Therefore, with respect to that occasion, do not posit analytical meditation as                                 to show that Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra teaches the Great Middle Way, which is beyond consciousness, as the finality of a three-staged teaching: Similarly, the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra also says that, for the time being, one is taught mind-only, but finally having thoroughly passed beyond that, one is taught the middle without appearance, and that, having also passed beyond this, one is taught the middle with appearance, and it says that if one does not arrive at that, one has not seen the profound meaning of the Great Vehicle. a XV.135; gsang ba ’dus pa, guhyasamāja; Toh. 442, rgyud, vol. ca.

Actual way to cultivate special insight in dependence on calm abiding If the view of selflessness is not found, no matter what system of medi-tation you perform, that meditation will not dwell in the meaning of suchness. Therefore, it is necessary to find the view. If although you have understanding of the view, during meditation on suchness you do not meditate within being set in its context—not becoming mindful of it—such will not serve as meditation on suchness. Therefore, even to set [the mind] without contemplating anything at the end of first doing a little analysis of the view is not a sustaining of suchness. Even to become accustomed to a mere placement within the view upon becoming mindful of it is reduced to being just the way to sustain calm abiding explained earlier.c Therefore, such is not the meaning of texts describing the way to sustain special insight, which is distinct from that. For this reason, within individually analyzing the meaning of self-lessness by means of wisdom as explained before [when presenting the reasonings establishing selflessness], you should sustain [the view]. Moreover, if analytical meditation is solely done, the calm abiding gen-erated earlier will degenerate. Therefore, having mounted the horse of calm abiding, you should sustain [the view] within analysis and then periodically alternate it with stabilizing meditation. Furthermore, if due to too much analytical meditation stability lessens, you should perform more stabilizing meditation and reinstate the factor of stability. If due to too much stabilizing meditation you do not want to analyze or, despite analyzing, it is unworkable and the mind entirely goes into the factor of stability, you should perform more               a zhar la. b One-pointed meditation on suchness from within the context of the view is stabiliz-ing meditation, not analytical meditation.

It is very powerful when [in this way] the two—calm abiding and special insight—are cultivated within continuously making them equal; therefore, you should do it this way. The last of Kamalashīla’s [three works on the] Stages of Meditation says:a Moreover, when due to having cultivated special insight [too much], the wisdom [of individual analysis] becomes excessive, [the stability of ] calm abiding diminishes. Due to this, like a butter-lamp set in a breeze, the mind fluctuates [and becomes unstable], whereby suchness is not seen very clearly. Therefore [in order to achieve stability seeing suchness clearly], at that time you should cultivate [just] the calm abiding [of non-analytical fixation]. Also, when [the stability of] calm abiding is excessive, you will, like a person asleep, not see suchness very clearly [due to the diminishment of individual analysis]. There-fore, at that time also you should cultivate the wisdom [of indi-vidual analysis]. With respect to sustaining [meditation] within analysis in this way, it is not correct to stop analytical meditation upon holding that all con-ceptuality whatsoever is apprehension of signs—that is, apprehension of true existence. For earlierb [I] have proven in many ways that con-ceptuality apprehending true existence is just one class of conceptual-ity. It is established that to regard that whatever conceptuality appre-hends incurs the damage of reasoning is a deprecation in which the object of reasoned negation is excessivec and also is not the meaning of the scriptures. If with regard to other subjects you do not assert that whatever conceptuality apprehends incurs the damage of reasoning, but you think that whatever the mind apprehends with respect to the noumenon is a consciousness apprehending signs that is an adherence to true existence, this also is a fallacy in which the mode of estimation is faulty.

Objection: Concerning this, if meditation on suchness is for the sake of generating the non-conceptual, it will not be generated from indi-vidual analysis because the two—cause and effect—must accord. Answer: About this, the Supramundane Victor himself gave a clear answer; the Kāshyapa Chapter says:a Kāshyapa, it is thus: For example, from the rubbing together of two branches by the wind fire arises, and once arisen, the two branches are burned up. Similarly, Kāshyapa, if one has correct individual analysis [of things, through its force] a Superior’s faculty of wisdom is generated. Through its generation correct individual analysis itself is consumed. This says that a Superior’s wisdom is generated from individual analy-sis. Also, Kamalashīla’s middle [of three works on the] Stages of Medita-tion says:b When analyzing in that way with wisdom, yogis [meditating on emptiness] definitely do not apprehend an inherent nature of anything [being analyzed] as ultimately [existing], they enter into meditative stabilization [of emptiness] not conceptualizing [that objects truly exist]. They also realize the naturelessness of all phenomena. The conceptualization [of true existence]—of those who do not cultivate individual analysis of the nature of things with wisdom but only cultivate just a mere thorough abandonment of mental application—will never be reversed, and they will never realize naturelessness because of not hav-ing the illumination of wisdom. It is thus: The Supramundane Victor said [in the Kāshyapa Chapter] that when the fire of knowing the real just as it is arises from correct individual analysis itself, the wood of conceptuality is burned, like the fire of sticks rubbed together.               a ’od srung gi le’u, kāśyapaparivarta; Toh. 87, dkon brtsegs, vol. cha, 133a.7-133b.1; Tibetan and Chinese edited by Alexander von Staël-Holstein, Kāçyapaparivarta: A Mahāyanasūtra of the Ratnakūṭa Class (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1926; reprint, Tokyo: Meicho-fukyū-kai, 1977), 102; Sanskrit of this passage not extant.

The entities and modes of generating the pliancies are as explained earlier. More-over, because one even has the pliancy induced by calm abiding that has already been achieved and has not deteriorated, [the achievement of special insight] is not the mere presence of pliancy. Question: Then, what is it? Answer: When the power of having performed analytical meditation itself is able to induce pliancy, it then becomes special insight. This is the same for both special insight observing the diversity and special insight observing the mode [of being of phenomena]. Furthermore, in that way the Sūtra Unraveling the Thought says:a “Supramundane Victor, until a Bodhisattva has attained physi-cal and mental pliancy [induced through the power of analysis], what is the mental contemplation—that is an internal taking to mind of an image, an object of meditative stabilization, of those                                 cus is about to be generated. It is a mental lightness generated only from meditation when the mind happily stays on its object. This mental flexibility causes a favorable energy to circulate throughout the body, thereby producing physical flexibility removing all physical awk-wardness and dysfunction producing fatigue that leads to a lack of enthusi-asm for meditation. Your body feels light like cotton. This physical flexibility immediately engenders a bliss of physical flexibility, a feeling of comfort per-vading the body. Now you can use your body in virtuous activities in accor-dance with your wish. This physical pleasure leads to mental pleasure, called “bliss of mental flexibility,” making the mind full of joy that initially is a little too buoyant, but then gradually becomes more steady. At this juncture you attain an un-fluctuating flexibility. This marks the attainment of true calm abiding. Prior to this, you just have a similitude of calm abiding. With fully qualified calm abiding, your mind is powerfully concentrated enough to purify destructive emotions when it is joined with insight. When you enter into meditative equipoise, mental and physical flexibility are quickly generated, and it is as if your mind is mixed with space itself. Leaving meditation, your body is like new to you, and aspects of mental and physical flexibility remain. Outside of meditation your mind is firm like a mountain and so clear that it seems you could count the particles in a wall, and you have fewer counter-productive emotions, being mostly free from desire for pleasant sights, sounds, odors, tastes, and touches, as well as free from harm-ful intent, lethargy, sleepiness, excitement, contrition, and doubt. Also, sleep easily turns into meditation, in which you have many wonderful experiences. a Toh. 106, mdo sde, vol. ca, 26b.7-27a.1; Tibetan and English in Powers, Wisdom of Bud-dha, 152 and 153; Tibetan and French in Lamotte, Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, 90 and 211.

As long as physical and mental pliancy [induced through the power of analysis] are not generated, [this analyti-cal meditation] is a mental contemplation that is a similitude of special insight.

Therefore, this inducing of calm abiding through analytical meditation of individual analysis by its own power is a quality of previously having achieved calm abiding. Since in that way calm abiding becomes far more developed through analytical meditation performed by one who has already achieved calm abiding well, you should not hold onto thinking that if analytical meditation of individual analysis is performed, the factor of stability will diminish.

Answer: It is by way of the nine mental abidings. It is thus: In dependence upon having thoroughly established the medi-tative stabilization [of calm abiding induced by] having at-tained the ninth [mental abiding called] “equipoise,” one [re-peatedly performs analytical meditation by way of making] intense effort at higher wisdom differentiating phenomena. At that time the path of the differentiation of phenomena comes to [continuously] operate naturally and without exer-tion, and similar to [when] the path of calm abiding [was at-tained] there is no activity [of exertionc]. Due to this, special insight is conjoined with thorough purity [from laxity and excitement], thorough refinement [without any discomfort or unserviceability], subsequence to calm abiding [that is to say, one-pointed stability like calm abiding], and blissful ex-perience [due to having generated pliancy induced by the power of analysis].

Because these two [texts] do not accord with the mode of commenting on emptiness in this [Middle Way Consequence] system, [the ten samenesses] are to be explained differently here. Concerning this, the first sameness is that all phenomena are simi-lar in that appearances of [their] dissimilar characteristics [such as white, red, and so forth]c do not exist in the perspective of a Superior’s meditative equipoise [on thusness]. The second is that all phenomena are the same in being without establishment by way of their own char-acter.

Furthermore, mere identification of (1) a true establishment that is superficially imputed by proponents of tenets and (2) [the conscious-ness] apprehending such true establishment is not sufficient.

Nga-wang-pel-den, on the other hand, holds that what arises from a consciousness appre-hending true existence is an artificial apprehension of true existence in the continuum of a Proponent of True Existence. In his Annotations for (Jam-yang-shay-pa’s) “Great Exposi-tion of Tenets” (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 740-742) he recasts the meaning of this passage as follows: The subject, an innate consciousness conceiving true existence, which con-ceives that phenomena ultimately exist inherently whereas they do not, is called an “obscurer” (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) or obstructor (sgrib byed) because a consciousness conceiving true existence, like an eye obstructed by an eye dis-ease, obstructs itself from seeing suchness [or] this consciousness conceiving true existence veils other awarenesses from seeing suchness, like covering something with a cloth. This is because the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra says: The production of things [exists] conventionally (kun rdzob tu, saṃvṛtyā); Ultimately it lacks inherent existence. That [consciousness] mistaken regarding the lack of inherent exis-tence Is asserted as the obscurer of reality (yang dag kun rdzob, satyaṃ saṃvṛti). ...Since an artificial awareness in the continuum of a Proponent of True Exis-tence arises from that consciousness conceiving true existence, all false things such as forms and so forth—which are the observed objects of such an artificial awareness that sees them displayed by that consciousness conceiv-ing true existence as if they are truly existent—exist only conventionally, not ultimately. Not only does that artificial awareness arise from a consciousness conceiving true existence but also this consciousness conceiving true exis-tence arises through the maturation of beginningless predispositions for mis-take. This consciousness conceiving true existence displays truly established phenomena to all living beings as if they exist, whether their awarenesses are affected by systems of tenets or not, and those living beings also perceive them that way. Therefore, since it would not be suitable to posit phenomena as existing through the force of appearing to a consciousness conceiving true existence, existence that is posited through the force of appearing to a non-defective awareness—its factors of appearance and conception not being affected by the force of a consciousness conceiving true existence—is the meaning of ex-isting conventionally. Hence, the object of negation, true existence, does not appear to sense consciousnesses.

The passage “...is called an ‘obscurer’ (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) because it ob-structs [itself ] from [perception of ] suchness or because it veils [other awarenesses] from perception of suchness” is the meaning of “the obscurer of reality (yang dag kun rdzob, satyaṃ saṃvṛti)” [in the quote from the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra].

The passage “Moreover, that [apprehension of true existence] arises through the maturation of beginningless predispositions for mis-take” indicates that this apprehension of true existence is innate. Therefore, [Kamalashīla] speaks of “all living beings.” The “thoughts” of those living beings are not just conceptual con-sciousnesses but also are to be taken as non-conceptual conscious-nesses. False things—that is to say, that do not exist ultimately but are posited as existing through the force of those two [conceptual and non-conceptual consciousnesses]—exist only conventionally. This is the meaning of the statement in the [Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra], “The production of things [exists] conventionally (kun rdzob tu, saṃvṛtyā).” Moreover, this does not mean that [such falsities] exist conventionally in the sense of existing for a saṃvṛti (kun rdzob) that is an apprehender of true existence.

Answer: That is true. You need to understand that the qualification “ultimately” is affixed in two ways to the object of negation: 1. Rational consciousnesses of hearing, thinking, and meditating are taken as the ultimate [consciousness], and what is not established by them [is not ultimately established, that is to say, not estab-lished for an ultimate consciousness], as described [by Kamalashīla just] above. 2.

Existing in an objective mode of subsistence without being merely pos-ited through the force of appearing to a non-defective awareness is pos-ited as “existing ultimately,” and not existing in that way is posited as “not existing ultimately.” Concerning these: 1. Both the ultimate in the first mode of positing [that is, a conceptual ra-tional consciousness analyzing suchness] and something established in its perspective [namely, emptiness] exist. 2.

Not differentiating these [two meanings of “ultimate”], many have held that the measure of the object of negation is “that which is able to bear reasoned analysis”c or “a thing able to bear analysis.”d In depend-ence upon this, it appears that many mistakes asserting that ultimate truths are not established bases [that is, do not exist] or that ultimate truths are truly established have arisen.

Whatever is established in the perspective of the former ultimate [that is, in the perspective of a conceptual rational consciousness] is not necessarily es-tablished as the latter ultimate [as existing in an objective mode of subsistence without being posited through the force of an awareness] because having ana-lyzed whether or not something truly exists, a rational consciousness finds non-establishment of true existence, and it does not find true existence. b Emptiness is established for a rational consciousness but is not truly established, and the apprehension that any other phenomenon is established for such a rational con-sciousness is artificial and not innate. c rigs pas dpyad bzod. d dpyad bzod pa’i dngos po. e gshis lugs la dang don dam du med. f chos nyid, dharmatā. g Nga-wang-pel-den (Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 745) gives more detail: If these are understood well, you will know that it is not contradictory: • to say that something is not established as [its own] mode of disposition"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" Autonomy School on True Existence 195 Indicating truth and falsity relative to worldly persons through the example of a magician’s illusion Since for understanding the styles of existence posited and not posited through the force of an awareness, making these known in terms of the example of a [magician’s] illusion is praised, let us explain it. When a magician causes a pebble, twig, or the like to appear as a horse or ele-phant, there are three [types of persons present]: l. the magician 2. the audience whose eyes have been affected [by the mantra the magician has cast] 3. [a person who comes later and thus] whose eyes have not been af-fected [by the mantra]. For the first [that is, the magician] there is the mere appearance as a horse or elephant, but he/she does not adhere to such [as being true]. The second [the audience whose eyes have been affected] have both the appearance [as horse or elephant] and adherence to that appearance. The third [a person whose eyes have not been affected] has neither the appearance as a horse or elephant nor adherence to it. When, for example, a rope is mistaken for a snake, it is said that the rope is a snake in the perspective of that consciousness but in general is not a snake. However, it is not suitable to say that similarly, when a ba-sis of conjuring appears as a horse or elephant, the appearance as a horse or elephant is only in the perspective of a mistaken conscious-ness but in general the basis of conjuring does not appear as a horse or elephant [because it does]. Even though that qualification [that is, “in general”] is not affixed, it must be asserted that the basis of conjuring                                 (gshis lugs su ma grub pa) and is not ultimately established • and to assert that ultimate truths exist and to propound that ultimate truths are the mode of subsistence and are ultimates. Due to not distinguishing these, there arose explanations such as: • The great translator Ngok [Lo-den-shay-rap (blo ldan shes rab, rngog lo chen po, 1059-1109)], sole eye of the snowy land, said that ultimate truths are not objects of knowledge. • The lord of reasoning Cha-pa Chö-kyi-seng-ge (cha pa or phywa pa chos kyi seng ge, 1109-1169) asserted that ultimate truths are truly established in the sense of being able to bear analysis by reasoning. • Dro-lung-pa’s (gro lung pa blo gros ’byung gnas, eleventh century) Stages of the Teaching and so forth explain that through dividing one awareness by way of conceptually isolatable factors [it can be said that] there is no ob-ject of a rational consciousness, but there is an object of an inferential consciousness."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"196 Tsong-kha-pa: The Object of Negation does appear as a horse or elephant [even though it only appears so for a mistaken consciousness] because if this were not the case, mistakes regarding appearances would not occur. Therefore, that the basis of conjuring can be posited as appearing as a horse or elephant is, according to the magician, through the force of appearing that way to a mistaken awareness; it is not posited other-wise through the force of the mode of abiding of the basis of conjuring itself. As for the audience, the appearance as a horse or elephant does not seem to be posited through the force of an internal awareness; rather, they conceive that there is a fully qualified horse or elephant dwelling on that place where the appearance is, covering that spot. In terms of the example, those are how something is apprehended to be posited through the force of an awareness and is apprehended not to be posited through the force of an awareness. When a basis [that is, an object] appears in a certain way, there are two [types]—those that do and do not correspond with the mode of subsistence as it appears. When you understand well this [presentation of how phenomena are posited through the force of the mind according to the Autonomy School], you will come to differentiate the two positions [of the Auton-omy School and the Proponents of True Existence which some] confuse. They think: Objects of comprehension [that is, all objects] are posited through the force of valid cognitions, and since valid cognitions are awarenesses, the positing of objects of comprehension through them is a case of positing [objects] through the force of an awareness. Hence, even the systems of the Proponents of True Existence refute true establishment. [However,] that objects of comprehension are posited [that is, certified] through the force of valid cognitions means that valid cognitions real-ize the mode of abiding of the two [types of ] objects of comprehen-sion.a Therefore, the two—this [meaning of positing or certifying ob-jects of comprehension] and the former [meaning of positing objects through the force of an awareness according to the Autonomy School] are utterly dissimilar. According to the Yogic Middle Way Autonomists [who do not assert external objects], the appearance of such an illusion is established [or certified] by a self-knowing direct perception, and according to [the Sūtra Middle Way Autonomists] who assert external objects, the               a The two types of objects of comprehension are specifically and generally character-ized objects, or impermanent and permanent objects, or manifest and hidden objects."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" Autonomy School on True Existence 197 appearance of such an illusion is established [or certified] by a sense direct perception apprehending the basis—for instance, the area [on which the illusion appears] or intermediate space [in which it appears]. With respect to its not existing in accordance with how it appears, [that the illusory horse or elephant exists as it appears] is refuted with signs [that is, reasons] such as, “If it did exist that way, it would be seen by those whose eyes are not affected [by the mantra], but they do not see it,” and so forth. At this time, a combination of the two—appearing that way and an emptiness of that—is established, at which point [the illusion] is established as a falsity relative to an ordinary conventional awareness not involved in [philosophical] tenets. Hence, an awareness that establishes [or certifies] this [composite of appearance and empti-ness] and a reflection’s emptiness of what it appears to be is not as-serted to be either a coarse or a subtle rational consciousness.a Even if something is truly established in terms of a conventional ordinary awareness,b if [an object] appears as that, it could not be empty of it, and also if it is empty of that, it could not appear that way. Hence, if a combination of those two [that is, appearing one way and existing another] occurs, it is only a falsity in terms of an ordinary awareness. Explanation within applying the example to the meaning When external and internal phenomena appear as truly existent, sen-tient beings, like the audience of magic whose eyes are affected [by the mantra cast by the magician], apprehend that there is a mode of subsis-tence of those phenomena not posited through the force of an aware-ness. This apprehension is the innate apprehension of true existence which has operated beginninglessly. What the Autonomists posit this way is very coarse relative to the Consequentialists’ apprehension of the object of negation; hence, it is not the innate subtle apprehension of true existence [according to the               a rigs shes. A coarse rational consciousness establishes a coarse selflessness, whereas a subtle rational consciousness establishes a subtle selflessness. b “True establishment in terms of a conventional ordinary awareness” does not refer to the object of negation as the term “true establishment” usually does but to something that is true on the conventional level. Even on the conventional level, if something is true, there will be no conflict between how it appears and how it is; it will not appear to be something and yet not be that, and correspondingly if it is empty of something, that is, if it is not something, it will not appear to be that. Therefore, a magician’s illusion, since it appears to be a real object and yet is not, cannot be true (or truly established) in a conventional sense of true establishment and thus must be a falsity, appearing one way and existing another."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198 Tsong-kha-pa: The Object of Negation Consequentialists]. When the true existence apprehended by the apprehension of true existence is refuted through reasoning, one—like the magician—does not apprehend external and internal phenomena as having a mode of abiding that is not posited through the force of an internal awareness; rather, one understands [external and internal phenomena] as mere existents posited through the force of an awareness. Moreover, those posited through the force of an awareness that are not damaged by valid cognition are asserted as existing in conventional terms; however, everything posited through the force of an awareness is not asserted as existing in conventional terms. Although the production of a sprout from a seed is posited through the force of an awareness, it is not contradictory that the sprout also is produced from the seed from its own side. This is like the fact that there is an appearance as a horse or an elephant even from the side of the basis of conjuring [that is, a pebble or twig]. Through this, all phe-nomena existing in conventional terms are to be understood. Even the noumenon is posited as existing through the force of the awareness to which it appears. Hence, it is not an exception to being posited as existing in conventional terms. Therefore, the significance of applying the example, a magician’s illusion, to the meaning—other phenomena—is not at all that just as a magician’s illusion appears to be a horse or an elephant but is empty of being such, so all [phenomena] such as pots and so forth appear to be pots and so forth, but are empty of being pots and so forth. For, if that were the case, being that phenomenon [for example, being a pot] would not occur, and the application of the example to the meaning would be that [phenomena] appear to be such-and-such but are not the actual thing. When non-conceptual pristine wisdom of meditative equipoise is generated, in its perspective all dualistic appearances are quiescent. This is like one whose eyes, not having been affected [by the magician’s mantra], have neither the illusory appearance nor adherence to it. Later [in Chandrakīrti’s text] there is no indication of the Autono-mists’ uncommon modes of refuting [true existence] by reasoning; therefore, let us here express briefly and in a way easy to understand how through this system all phenomena are caused to appear as like a magician’s illusions. Objects of knowledge are inclusively divided into the two: effective things and non-effective things [or impermanent and permanent phenomena]. Let us explain this with respect to effective things first."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" Autonomy School on True Existence 199 Effective things are inclusively divided into the physical and non-physical. Applying the refutation, as explained elsewhere, of physical things that are directionally partless—eastern direction, and so forth—and of consciousnesses that are temporally partless, [the Autonomists] prove that effective things necessarily have parts. Then, if parts and whole were different entities, they would be unrelated; thereby [a dif-ference of entity of parts and whole] is refuted, and [parts and whole] are shown to be one entity. At that time, no matter how the mind looks into it, it is undeniable that although the mode of being [of parts and whole] is to be one en-tity, in their mode of appearance [to thought] they appear to be differ-ent entities. Thereby, it is delineated that [effective things] are, like a magician’s illusions, a combination of the two—appearing one way and being empty of [existing] that way. Then, although such is not contradictory in the context of the mode of abiding of a falsity posited through the force of appearing to an awareness, if a certain base [that is, a certain phenomenon] had a mode of subsistence not posited through the force of appearing to an awareness, [such a combination of appearance and emptiness] would not at all be reasonable because discordant modes of abiding and of ap-pearance cannot occur in what is truly established, as was explained earlier, because if something is truly established, it must abide in a manner devoid of falsity in all respects and because [since appearance and mode of being would necessarily be concordant,] the awareness to which [parts and whole] appear as different entities would have to be unmistaken, thereby damaging their being one entity. Once this is established [with respect to effective things], in de-pendence on that reasoning it can be refuted that non-effective things are truly established. For, even with respect to uncompounded space, it must be asserted that it pervades certain physical objects, and regard-ing this it must be asserted that it has a part pervading the east and parts pervading the other directions. Likewise, the noumenon [or emp-tiness] also has many parts pervading [phenomena], as well as many different parts realized by different former and later awarenesses. Also, other uncompounded [phenomena] are similar. Therefore, since the two—the many parts and the whole—are not fit to be different entities, they are one entity. Also, that [same discrepancy between modes of being and of appearance] is suitable in a falsity but not suitable in what is truly established. Hence, [the true establishment of uncompounded phenomena] is refuted as before [with compounded phenomena], whereby all objects of knowledge are established to be without true"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"200 Tsong-kha-pa: The Object of Negation existence. Since this treatment is the assertion of the father Shānta-rakṣhita and his spiritual son [Kamalashīla], reckoning part and whole only for effective things is a flaw of those with small intelligence. The falsity renowned among those whose awarenesses have not been affected by tenets does not have the same meaning as the falsity asserted by the Middle Way School; therefore, although it is posited by an awareness, [this type of being posited by an awareness] is in accor-dance with how that is renowned to them. However, in the [Autono-mists’] own system merely this is not asserted as [the meaning of being] posited by an awareness. [Concluding remarks] In that way, even though there is no mode of subsistence not posited by the force of appearing to an awareness, in this system it is not contra-dictory for there to be a mode of subsistence that is posited by the force of appearing to an awareness but is not merely nominally imputed,a [whereas such is contradictory in the Consequence School]. Hence, the objects of negation in the two Middle Way Schools come to differ greatly with regard to the perspective of the awareness [in the face of which objects are posited].b Having seen that contemporary persons—who have been briefly instructed well in [the Autonomists’] identification of true [existence] and [their estimation of ] the apprehension of true existence as well as [their] reasonings refuting those—discern the Consequentialists’ view well when, afterwards, that system is taught, [I] have explained these here.               a ming tu btags pa tsam min pa. b For the Autonomists the awareness is any consciousness, either conceptual or non-conceptual, not affected by superficial causes of mistake, whereas for the Consequen-tialists it must be only conceptual, as will be described below."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 201 3.

[The rope’s] speckled color and mode of coiling are similar to those of a snake, and when this is per-ceived in a dim area, the thought arises with respect to the rope, “This is a snake.” As for the rope, at that time [when it is imputed to be a snake], the collection and parts of the rope are not even in the slightest way positable as an illustration of a snake [that is, positable as a snake]. Therefore, that snake is merely imputed by conceptuality. In the same way, when the thought “I” arises in dependence upon the [mental and physical] aggregates, nothing in terms of the aggre-gates—neither the collection that is the continuum of the earlier and later [moments], nor the collection [of the parts] at one time, nor the parts of those [mental and physical aggregates]—is even in the slightest way positable as an illustration of that “I” [that is, positable as “I”].

Furthermore, with regard to whatever is imputed in dependence upon an aggregation of parts, the parts or the whole are not suitable to be posited as an illustration of it [that is, as something that is it], and anything that is a different entity from those two also could not be an illustration of it either. The mere factor of how a pot and so forth are posited by conceptu-ality is similar to the imputation of a rope as a snake. However, whether those two—a pot, and so forth, and a rope-snake—exist or do not exist, are able or unable to perform functions, and so forth are not at all similar.

To refute that, he says, “It is not established by way of its own selfness.” Hence, those who propound that it is the system of this master that if a pristine wisdom of meditative equipoise comprehended an ultimate truth, [the ultimate] would be truly established and that, therefore, [the ultimate] is not an object of knowledgec have not at all realized the meaning of [Chandrakīrti’s] explanation that although [ultimate truth] is found by [a consciousness in] meditative equipoise, it is not truly es-tablished.

He is not saying that pots, woolen cloth, and so forth, which are obscurational truths, are posited by that consciousness apprehending true existence because he asserts that what is posited by a consciousness apprehending true existence does not exist even in conventional terms. Therefore, it ap-pears that, because of the similarity of name between the saṃvṛti [ob-scuring consciousness] in the perspective of which the truth that is part of saṃvṛtisatya [obscurational truth] is posited and the saṃvṛti [conventionality or conventional consciousness] in the positing of pots and so forth as existing conventionally, many cases of mistaking these even to have the same meaning have arisen; therefore, these should be differentiated well.

Though some contemporary Ge-luk-pa scholars explain this discrepancy by claiming that Tsong-kha-pa was quoting from memory, it strikes me that Tsong-kha-pa was de-liberately trying to make the passage clearer by lifting it above mere literal translation into a more fluid rendering. Chandrakīrti actually says: Moreover, for Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have aban-doned afflictive ignorance and who see compositional phenomena as just be-ing like the existence of reflections and so forth, those [compositional phenomena] have a fabricated nature and are not truths because they have no conceit of true existence."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"242 Tsong-kha-pa: The Two Truths Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas]. Furthermore, because [Chandrakīrti] does not take these to be just any Hearers, Solitary Real-izers, or Bodhisattvas, he mentions qualifications [“who have aban-doned afflictive ignorance and who see compositional phenomena as like reflections and so forth”]. One qualification is the direct realization that all compounded phenomena are empty of inherent existence but appear to be inherently existent, like reflections. Since even Bodhisatt-vas on the seventh ground and below as well as Hearers and Solitary Realizers who are Learner Superiors [that is, who have reached the path of seeing but not the path of no more learning] have merely this [direct realization], in order to eliminate them [Chandrakīrti] says of the three persons that they “have abandoned ignorance.” Hence, the three persons are to be taken as Bodhisattvas on the pure grounds [that is, on the eighth, ninth, and tenth grounds] and the two types of Foe Destroyers, Hearer and Solitary Realizer. [These pots and so forth] are not truths in the perspective of those three. The reason why these are not truths [in their perspective] is that they have no conceit of true existence,a that is, they do not have the conception of true existence;b this is because they have extinguished the ignorance apprehending true existence.c Hence, it is proven that external and internal phenomena are not established as truths in the perspective of obscuring [consciousnesses] of those three types of per-sons [because they do not have such ignorance]. Through commenting in that way, [Chandrakīrti] has not at all proven that [external and in-ternal phenomena] are not obscurational truths in their perspective but has proven that these are not truths [in their perspective]. Those who, despite this, hold that [Chandrakīrti’s commentary] has proven that these are not obscurational truths [in the perspective of those three types of persons] have a bad mode of explanation, having con-taminated the master [Chandrakīrti’s] thought with the defilements of their own minds due to the very great coarseness of the operation of their minds.

If, in contrast to the above explanation, [Chandrakīrti] were prov-ing that [external and internal phenomena] are not obscurational truths in the perspective of those [three types of persons, the reason that he stated, “because they have no conceit of true existence,”] would be an extremely unrelated proof because for a base [that is, an object] to be established as an obscurational truth in the perspective of a cer-tain awareness, that base must be established as a falsity, and hence stating as the reason [why external and internal phenomena are not obscurational truths in the perspective of those three types of persons] that they do not have apprehension of true existence would be a source of laughter.a In order to establish for a certain awareness that a base [that is, an object] is an obscurational truth, [that object] must be estab-lished [for that awareness] as a falsity. The reason for this is by way of the essential that if it is seen that when positing the truth that is part of the term “obscurational truth” with respect to pots and so forth, it must be posited—from between an awareness and fact—as a truth in the perspective of just an obscuring [consciousness] that apprehends true existence and is not posited as a truth in fact, it must be seen that if that distinction [of being in the perspective of an obscuring con-sciousness] is not applied, it is not established as a truth and is a falsity.

These are Hearers and Solitary Realizers on the paths of seeing and of meditation as well as Bo-dhisattvas on the first through seventh Bodhisattva grounds. a That these beings do not have consciousnesses apprehending inherent existence indicates that they understand that external and internal phenomena are obscurational truths—objects that seem to exist the way they appear only for an ignorant conscious-ness. They can understand this because they no longer have such ignorance. Thus it would be ridiculous to indicate that these persons who understand that forms and so forth are falsities do not understand that these are obscurational truths."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"244 Tsong-kha-pa: The Two Truths Manifest Knowledges,a and since understanding it appears to be very important, let us explain it. Consciousnesses apprehending that things truly exist are of two types, those apprehending persons to truly exist and those apprehending [other] phenomena to truly exist. It has al-ready been explained that just these are considered to be the two ap-prehensions of self. Both Chandrakīrti’s Autocommentary on the “Supple-ment to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’” and his Commentary on (Āry-adeva’s) “Four Hundred” explain that this consciousness apprehending true existence is an afflictive ignorance and explain that Hearer and Solitary Realizer Foe Destroyers have abandoned this ignorance,b and Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on (Āryadeva’s) “Four Hundred” explains that Bodhisattvas who have attained forbearance with respect to the doc-trine of no production [this being at the beginning of the eighth Bodhi-sattva ground] have abandoned it. Therefore, afflictive ignorance is the faction discordant with knowledge of the suchness of selflessness, and, furthermore, afflictive ignorance is not to be taken as merely an ab-sence of that knowledge [of selflessness] or as merely other than it but is the discordant faction that is the contrary [of knowledge of selfless-ness]—a superimposition that persons and [other] phenomena are in-herently established. Taken that way, [the Consequence School’s] positing that a [con-sciousness] superimposing a self of phenomena is an afflictive igno-rance and its positing that the two apprehensions—that “I” and “mine” are established by way of their own character—are views of the transi-tory collectionc do not accord with the Proponents of Manifest Knowl-edge.d The systems of the Proponents of Manifest Knowledge, as is explained in the ninth chapter of Vasubandhu’s Autocommentary on the “Treasury of Manifest Knowledge,”e posit a [consciousness] apprehending               a These are the abhidharmas that are primarily set forth, respectively, in Asaṅga’s Sum-mary of Manifest Knowledge (chos mngon pa kun btus, abhidharmasamuccaya; P5550, vol. 112) and in Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Manifest Knowledge (chos mngon pa’i mdzod, abhidharma-kośa; P5590, vol. 115). b Chandrakīrti’s Autocommentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Mid-dle’” explains that Hearers and Solitary Realizers know that all phenomena lack inher-ent existence; see Hopkins, Compassion in Tibetan Buddhism, 150-160; and La Vallée Pous-sin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 19.17ff; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 8 (1907): 268. c ’jig tshogs la lta ba, satkāyadṛṣṭi. d mngon pa ba, *ābhidharmika. e chos mngon pa’i mdzod kyi bshad pa, abhidharmakośabhāṣya; P5591, vol. 115.

Apprehension that persons substantially exist in the sense of being self-sufficient also exists among those whose awarenesses are not af-fected by tenets,b but [according to the Consequence School] apprehen-sion that persons exist as other than the [mental and physical] aggre-gates in the sense of having a character discordant with them does not exist among those whose awarenesses are not affected by tenets. Thus, views holding to extremes also are of two types [innate and artificial]. Question: How does one prove to those whose position is that per-sons and phenomena are established by way of their own character that those apprehensions are afflictive ignorance and the two appre-hensions of self ? Answer: The inherent establishment of persons and [other] phe-nomena is negated by the reasonings refuting this, and at that time it is established that a consciousness apprehending such is a consciousness apprehending true existence that is mistaken with respect to its con-ceived object. Also, when this is established, it is established that the apprehensions of the two, persons and [other] phenomena, as truly es-tablished are the two apprehensions of self. When those are estab-lished, it is established that this apprehension of true existence is the discordant faction that is the contrary of knowledge of suchness, whereby it is established that this is ignorance. Because it can be proven that until this is extinguished, the view of the transitory [as in-herently existent “I” and “mine”] is also not extinguished, it is estab-lished that [these apprehensions of persons and other phenomena as truly existent] are afflictive ignorance. Hence, it is very important to know how to posit the [Consequentialists’] unique presentation of af-flictive emotions. With respect to how other afflictive emotions such as desire and so forth also operate from the bewilderment that is a consciousness ap-prehending true existence, let us explain this in accordance with                                 not a metaphoric expression for a series of skandhas.

Chandrakīrti says (see also Insight, 51):b Bewilderment, due to being beclouded with respect to those [objects] from considering them to be true [that is, truly estab-lished], enters into the superimposition that things have their own true entities. Also, desire and so forth operate within the superimposition of features, such as beauty and ugliness, on just the inherent nature of things imputed by bewilderment. Hence, they operate non-separately from bewilderment and also depend on bewilderment, because bewilderment is just chief. [The first sentence] “Bewilderment, due to being beclouded [with re-spect to things] from considering them to be true, enters into the su-perimposition that things have their own true entities” indicates that bewilderment is a [consciousness] apprehending true existence. That desire and so forth operate non-separately from bewilderment [means] that they operate in association with bewilderment; they do not oper-ate separate from it. The reason for this is that they “operate within the superimposition of features, such as beauty and ugliness, on just the inherent nature of things imputed by bewilderment.” Concerning this, [a consciousness] superimposing attractiveness or unattractiveness on objects is improper mental application, which is the cause producing the two, desire and hatred; therefore, [this passage] does not indicate the mode of apprehension of the two, desire and hatred.c Therefore,               a Stanza VI.10ab; stanzas VI.10-11; Toh. 3846, dbu ma, vol. tsha, 7b.2-7b.3; Lang, Āry-adeva’s Catuḥśataka, 66; Sonam Rinchen and Ruth Sonam, Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas, 156-157.

First ignorance superimposes inherent existence on the object; then improper mental application superimposes inherently existent beauty or ugliness, after which desire and hatred are generated."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"   Obscurational   Truths   247   “desire and so forth operate within the superimposition of features, such as beauty and ugliness, on just the inherent nature of things im-puted by bewilderment” says that the two, desire and hatred, operate in dependence upon the superimposition of only inherently established attractiveness or unattractiveness [superimposed by improper mental application]. [Chandrakīrti] is not indicating that just true establishment im-puted by bewilderment is the object of observation [of desire and ha-tred] from between the two, the object of observation and the subjec-tive aspect of desire and so forth. This is because—from between the two, the object of observation and the subjective aspect—the objects of observation of both innate [consciousnesses] apprehending self are es-tablished bases [that is, they are existent, whereas truly established objects do not exist at all], and desire and so forth have the same object of observation as bewilderment, since even they are in similar associa-tion with it. [Consciousnesses] induced by those two improper mental applica-tions [superimposing attractiveness or unattractiveness on the object] and that have the aspect of desiring the object or of not desiring—that is to say, turning away from—the object come to be desire and hatred. Hence, [in the Consequence School] mere [consciousnesses] that are induced by the apprehension of a person as substantially existent in the sense of being self-sufficient and that have the aspects of desiring or not desiring are not posited as [encompassing all] desire and hatred. Therefore, even the modes of positing the two, desire and hated, are different [in the Consequence School from how these are posited in the other schools. That desire and hatred] “also depend on bewilderment” means that desire and so forth are induced by bewilderment that apprehends [ob-jects] to be established by way of their own character and that precedes them. The example [from the Four Hundred quoted above,] that “the body sense power [pervades] the body” means that just as the other four sense powers do not have a base posited separately from the body sense power, so all the other afflictive emotions operate in dependence upon bewilderment and operate without being separated from it. Therefore, all afflictive emotions are overcome through just overcom-ing bewilderment, and hence it is said that one should be intent on just discourse about its antidote—dependent-arising, the emptiness of in-herent establishment."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"248 Tsong-kha-pa: The Two Truths Nāgārjuna’s Seventy Stanzas on Emptinessa says that this apprehen-sion of things as truly existent is the ignorance that is the root of cyclic existence.

Existent predispositions of desire and so forth are also causes of such acts of body and speech.

[Chandrakīrti’s saying] “also” [in “The existent predispositions of desire and so forth are also causes of such acts of body and speech”] indicates that the predispositions of desire and so forth are also obstacles to distinguishing [all] objects of knowledge [simultaneously]; therefore, predispositions [established by] afflictive emotions are ob-structions to omniscience.

Through extinguishing all seeds of afflictive emotions, consciousnesses apprehending true exis-tence are not generated, but due to being polluted with predispositions, awarenesses mistaken with respect to their appearing objects [in that their appearing objects seem to inherently exist] are generated. Since Superiors who have not been Buddhafied have not aban-doned the ignorance that is an obstruction to omniscience, they have an alternation between conceptuality involving the appearance [of in-herent existence and/or conventional phenomena] in states subse-quent to meditative equipoise and the absence of [such] appearance in meditative equipoise. Buddhas, on the other hand, have completely, that is, entirely, become enlightened, that is, have realized actualiza-tion of the ultimate and conventional aspects of all phenomena; hence, all movements of conceptual minds and mental factors have utterly vanished, due to which they have no alternation between having or not having the conceptuality involving appearance [of inherent existence and/or conventional phenomena] in meditative equipoise and in states subsequent to meditative equipoise. [Chandrakīrti’s saying] “utterly” indicates that for other Superiors the vanishing [of the movement of conceptuality] in meditative equi-poise is temporary; therefore, [for them] meditative equipoise and sub-sequent attainment [that is, states subsequent to meditative equipoise] alternate. Hence, [Chandrakīrti’s saying] “because [those three types of beings] partake of the ignorance that is an obstruction to omniscience” is not a reason for their having appearance,a but is a proof for the alter-nating occurrence of the existence and non-existence of appearance in meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. The “movement of minds and mental factors” is asserted to be con-ceptuality, [since] Chandrakīrti’s Clear Words (see also Insight, 132) explains:b               a If the reason for their perceiving mere appearances outside of meditative equipoise were that they had obstructions to omniscience, then when those obstructions were removed, they would no longer perceive appearances. To avoid saying this, Tsong-kha-pa explains Chandrakīrti’s reason as being why they must alternate between meditative equipoise and a subsequent state in which they perceive appearances. b Commenting on stanza XVIII.9; Toh. 3860, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 120a.3-120a.4; La Vallée Poussin, Mūlamadhyamakakārikās (Mādhyamikasūtras) de Nāgārjuna avec la Prasannapadā, 374.1-374.2: vikalpaścittapracāraḥ / tadrahitatvāttattattvaṃ nirvikalpaṃ // yathoktaṃ sūtre / paramārthasatyaṃ katamat / yatra jñānasyāpyapracāraḥ kaḥ punarvādo ’kṣarāṇāmiti /."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"   Obscurational   Truths   253   If conceptuality is the movement of the mind, due to being de-void of it suchness is non-conceptual.

Though the force of his or her eyes being affected by cataracts, a per-son with cataracts sees falling hairs as well as bees and so on—which are [included] within [Chandrakīrti’s] “and so forth”—inside a vessel for food and drink, such as rhinoceros horn and so forth, which is in the hand. Seeing these, the person wishes to clean away the erroneous en-tities that he or she has imputed to be falling hairs, bees, and so forth and thereupon gets the difficulties of again and again turning the ves-sel upside down. Someone without cataracts, whose eyes are clear, real-izes this and approaches the person, whereupon even though the per-son without cataracts aims his or her sight to that place where the one with cataracts sees the entities of those falling hairs and so forth, he or               a Toh. 3861, vol. ’a, 205b.3; La Vallée Poussin, Madhyamakāvatāra, 109.6-109.9; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 11 (1910): 305."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"   Ultimate   Truth   257   she does not observe those aspects of falling hairs and does not concep-tualize anything having falling hairs as their substratum, that is to say, does not conceptualize any attributes of falling hairs. Moreover, when the one with cataracts reveals his or her thought to the one without cataracts, saying, “[I] see falling hairs,” the one without cataracts—wishing to clear up the idea of the one with cata-racts—takes cognizance of his or her perspective and speaks words in-tent on negation, saying, “There are no falling hairs here,” but the speaker has no deprecatory denial of falling hairs. The suchness of the falling hairs that are seen by the one with cataracts is what is seen by the one without cataracts; it is not what is seen by the one with cata-racts. Understand the meaning at this point in accordance with these two examples. With respect to how this is to be understood, the entities of the ag-gregates, constituents, sense spheres, and so forth observed by those who do not see suchness because their minds are damaged, that is, pol-luted, by the cataracts of ignorance are the conventional entities of those aggregates and so forth, like the hairs observed by those with cataracts. That object—which is observed by not seeing those very ag-gregates and so forth and which the Buddhas, being free from the pre-dispositions of ignorance, the obstructions to omniscience, perceive as the nature of the aggregates and so forth in the way that the eyes of one without cataracts do not see falling hairs—is the ultimate truth of those Buddhas. Dispelling objections to that Objection: Just as the eyes of those without cataracts do not perceive even an appearance of falling hairs, so if a Buddha does not perceive conventionalities, such as aggregates and so forth, which appear to awarenesses polluted by ignorance, then those would not exist because if something exists, it must be perceived by a Buddha. If conventionali-ties such as aggregates do not exist, then even the attainment of Buddhahood would not exist because a person who initially generates a mind [of altruistic aspiration to Buddhahood] is one who is polluted by ignorance. Answer: Let us explain how this fallacy does not occur. There are two ways that a Buddha’s pristine wisdom knows objects of knowl-edge—a mode of knowing all objects of knowledge that are ultimate truths and a mode of knowing all objects of knowledge that are obscurational truths. Concerning those, the first is knowledge of the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"258 Tsong-kha-pa: The Two Truths suchness of the aggregates and so forth in the manner of not perceiving their conventional appearances. The second is knowledge [of those ag-gregates and so forth] in the perspective of the pristine wisdom know-ing the diversity [of phenomena] in the manner of dualistic appearance as object and subject; this is because it is not suitable to posit that a Buddha has implicit realization in which something is realized even though it does not appear and hence [everything] must be known upon its appearing.a Although with respect to a Buddha’s knowledge of the diversity the aggregates and so forth do not appear upon its being polluted by the predispositions of ignorance, what appears to the consciousnesses of other persons that are polluted with ignorance must appear to a Bud-dha. This is because it is not suitable for those appearances to be non-existent, and if a conventionality exists, it must be observed by [a Bud-dha’s] knowledge of the diversity. Although the falling hairs that ap-pear to one with cataracts do not appear to the eye consciousness of one free from cataracts, those appearances do not need to be non-existent; therefore, they are unlike [the situation with] a Buddha [wherein if a conventionality exists, it must appear to a Buddha, and if something does not appear to a Buddha, it must not exist]. Until the predispositions for mistaken dualistic appearance have been extinguished, the two direct comprehensions (1) of the mode of being [of phenomena] and (2) of the diversity [of phenomena] cannot be generated in one entity, due to which these must be comprehended within an alternation between meditative equipoise and states subse-quent to meditative equipoise, and, therefore, comprehension of these two does not come within a single instant of pristine wisdom. When the predispositions for mistakenness have been completely abandoned, the generation of the two pristine wisdoms within each instant of pristine wisdom is continuous; hence, alternation between directly compre-hending and not comprehending the two types of objects of knowledge at one time is not necessary. For this reason, [our presentation] also does not contradict the statement: A single instant of exalted knowledge Pervades the full circle of objects of knowledge. That although the two pristine wisdoms are one entity, there is not even the slightest contradiction in there coming to be two different modes of knowledge in relation to two [types of ] objects is an attribute               a This counters Dol-po-pa’s notion that a Buddha only implicitly knows obscurational truths; see below, 275ff."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"   Ultimate   Truth   259   solely of a Buddha, a Supramundane Victor. Whereas that is the case, those who take only the mode of knowledge of suchness as the mode of a Buddha’s mode of knowledge and thereupon say that knowledge of the diversity [of phenomena] does not exist in a Buddha’s mental con-tinuum but instead is included within the continuums of trainees are deprecating a Buddha’s knowledge of the diversity. Also, some [other scholars] appear to deprecate both pristine wisdoms, saying that even knowledge of the mode [of being of phenomena] does not exist in a Buddha’s mental continuum. Some remaining topics concerning this will be explained on the occasion of [explaining the eleventh ground,] the fruit. Objection: Would a nature with such an aspect of the vanishing of dualistic appearance not be unseen? Therefore, how do those Buddhas perceive it? Answer: Since dualistic appearance has vanished in the perspective of perceiving suchness, it is true that it is not perceived in a dualistic manner, but it is said that they perceive in the manner of non-perception. How this serves as an answer to the objection is: • because that knowledge of the mode [of being of phenomena] di-rectly perceives the suchness of the aggregates and so forth, and • because the non-establishment of the aggregates and so forth in the perspective of that perception is their suchness, and • because the suchness of the aggregates and so forth must be per-ceived in the manner of not perceiving them. Chandrakīrti’s Autocommentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Trea-tise on the Middle’” (see also Insight, 132) says:a Without contacting produced things, it actualizes solely the na-ture,b whereby suchness is understood; therefore, [a being who possesses such knowledge] is called “Buddha.” Thus, Chandrakīrti says that a Buddha’s pristine wisdom knowing the ultimate realizes only the noumenon without contacting the substrata. This has the same meaning as the statement that the suchness of the aggregates and so forth is seen in the manner of not seeing them. Also, with respect to the meaning of the statement (see also Insight,               a Commenting on VI.97; Toh. 3862, dbu ma, vol. ’a, 283a.2; La Vallée Poussin, Madhya-makāvatāra, 201.17-201.19; La Vallée Poussin, “Introduction au traité du milieu,” Muséon 12 (1911): 255. b rang bzhin, svabhāva.

Rather, as explained earlier, not see-ing the proliferations [of inherent existence and of conventionalities] is posited as seeing what is devoid of proliferations; therefore, the seen and the unseen do not refer to the same base. Moreover, in that way the Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom (see also Insight, 130) says:a The One-Gone-Thus teaches that one who does not see forms, Does not see feelings, does not see discriminations, Does not see intentions, does not see Consciousness, mind, or sentience sees the dharma.b Analyze how space is seen as in the expression By sentient beings in words, “Space is seen.” The One-Gone-Thus teaches that seeing the dharma is also like that. The seeing cannot be expressed by another example. This says that the unseen is the aggregates, and the seen is the dharma,c which means suchness,d as in the statement, “Whoever sees dependent-arising sees the dharma.” Furthermore, it is like, for example, the fact that space is a mere elimination of the obstructive objects of touch, and that seeing it—or realizing it—is taken as not seeing the preventive obstruction that is the object of negation and is suitable to be observed if it were present. In that [example], the seen is space, and the unseen is preventive ob-struction.

That it is not contradictory that although this pristine wisdom directly seeing suchness can be posited as a knower of the ultimate and ultimate truth can be posited as its ob-ject known, in the perspective of that pristine wisdom those two—agent and object—are absent is because agent and object are posited only in the perspective of conventional awarenesses.

However, in many Buddhist systems such as those of the Tibetan scholar-yogis Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsena (the principal author of the Jo-nang-pa order), Tsong-kha-pa Lo-sang-drak-pab (the founder of the Ge-luk-pa order), and Mi-pam-gya-tsoc (the foremost twentieth-century exponent of the Nying-ma order) “complete” conceptual maps are laid out with the moves neatly delineated. In order to follow the map, one must undergo the battering and smashing of misbegotten conceptuality, gain the appropriate con-ceptual realization and then through becoming accustomed to it and gaining intense concentration, eventually arrive at non-conceptual re-alization. It is a mistake to assume that these scholars are satisfied with a mere verbal lay-out of intricate philosophy. Rather, there is a basic rec-ognition that we are controlled by our ideas, and thus re-formation of ideas in a harrowing process of analytical meditation—involving one’s feelings in the most intimate sense—is of central importance. For in-stance, through not refuting phenomena themselves but qualifying that the object negated is inherent existence, Ge-luk-pa scholar-practitioners maintain the commonsense notion that one cannot say that something does not exist and then claim that it also is not non-existent. In this system the refutation of alternatives is not used to lift the mind to a non-conceptual level through shock but to penetrate the noumenon through a reasoned, conceptual process of refutation. When the negation of inherent existence is understood this way, realization during this phase is conceptual but not wandering among many con-ceptions; it is wholly focused on the absence of inherent existence. Sub-sequently, through combining that realization with the force of the stable meditative state of calm abiding, the ability to remain one-pointedly on emptiness is enhanced. Still, one needs to alternate stabi-lizing and analytical meditation on emptiness in order to induce special insight, which in turn is deepened over the path of preparation, result-ing in a totally non-conceptual realization of emptiness on the path of seeing.               a dol po pa shes rab rgyal mtshan, 1292-1361. b tsong kha pa blo bzang grags pa; 1357-1419. c mi pham ’jam dbyangs rnam rgyal rgya mtsho; 1846-1912."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266   Comparison   Thus, even though it is sometimes disappointing to encounter con-ceptual qualifications of scriptural passages that, without these qualifi-cations, seem to lift the reader beyond conceptuality, it is a mistake to conclude that these systemizations are intended to intellectualize the profound to the point of stultifying and blocking non-conceptual medi-tation. Rather, they seek to put the intellect in its place, using it in a profound way in a process leading to non-conceptual direct perception. Such pursuit of conceptual intricacies stimulates thought to the point where topics can come alive, yielding profound insight. What makes enlightenment possible? It is incumbent upon systems of self-liberation to show what factors pre-exist in the mind or spirit that allow for transformation into a state of freedom from suffering. In Tibet in the fourteenth and fifteenth cen-turies there was great ferment about what makes enlightenment possi-ble. This controversy about the nature of the mind, which persists to the present day, raises the questions: • Is the reality of the mind already endowed with ultimate Buddha qualities, or is reality just the immaculate nature of the mind that allows for Buddha qualities to be developed? • If conventional phenomena are empty of their ordinarily perceived status, is the reality of the mind empty of itself or is it empty only of conventional phenomena? • Do conventional objects have so little status that they do not ap-pear to a Buddha? • Is the reality of the mind known only by pristine wisdom, or is it also known through inference?

As Cyrus Stearns says:a Without question, the teachings and writing of Dol po pa, who was also known as “The Buddha from Dol po” (Dol po sangs rgyas), and “The Omniscient One from Dol po who Embodies the Buddhas of the Three Times” (Dus gsum sangs rgyas kun mkhyen dol po pa), contain the most controversial and stunning ideas ever presented by a great Tibetan Buddhist master. The con-troversies which stemmed from his teachings are still very much alive today among Tibetan Buddhists, more than 600 years after Dol po pa’s death. Dol-po-pa’s work was of seminal importance in the Tibetan cultural region, stretching from Kalmyk Mongolian areas near the Volga River (in Europe where the Volga empties into the Caspian Sea), to Mongolia, to the Buriat Republic of Siberia, as well as to Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, and parts of Nepal. Dol-po-pa was born in 1292 in a family that practiced tantric rites of the Nying-ma order. After receiving tantric initiation at the age of five, he had a vision of Red Mañjushrī, after which his intelligence is said to have burgeoned. At twelve he was ordained and at seventeen fled, against his parents’ wishes, to study in Mustang, where it is said that in a month he learned the doctrinal language of path-structure studies, epistemology and logic, and phenomenology. Dol-po-pa also received crucial teachings on the Kālachakra Tantra and related sūtras and commentaries that shaped his own practice and teachings. At the age of twenty-two, while making a tour of western and Cen-tral Tibet to learn at other institutions, he was recognized as highly learned, even being called “Omniscient,” an epithet that even his op-ponents still use. At twenty-nine in 1321, however, he was completely humbled when he visited the monastery of Jo-nang and saw that eve-ryone who was seriously practicing meditation had realized the nature of reality. In 1322 he received in-depth instruction on the Kālachakra Tantra and entered into two retreats, during which he is said to have gained realization of the first four branches of the six-branched yoga of the Kālachakra system. During the second retreat he realized the view of “other-emptiness” but did not speak about it for several years. In 1326 he was                                 other scholars. a Cyrus R.

Either during or after the building of the stūpa, for the first time he taught that conventional phenomena are self-empty, in the sense that they lack any self-nature, whereas the ul-timate is other-empty, in the sense that it is empty of the relative but has its own self-nature. This realization Dol-po-pa himself stated to be previously unknown in Tibet. He completed his magnum opus, Moun-tain Doctrine, Ocean of Definitive Meaning, before the final consecration of the monument. His view of “other-emptiness,” based largely on his understanding of the Kālachakra Tantra and commentary by Kalkī Puṇḍarīka and bol-stered by the Aṅgulimāla Sūtra, Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, Matrix of One-Gone-Thus Sūtra, Lion’s Roar of Shrīmālādevī Sūtra, and so forth, was received with amazement and shock. However, he was also highly lauded and received great offerings from exalted figures of the day. He gave teach-ings sometimes to thousands of persons and at other times to luminar-ies. Along with Bu-tön Rin-chen-drupa—another great master of Kāla-chakra—he was invited to China by the Yüan dynasty (Mongolian) Em-peror Toghon Temür. Neither of them went, and to avoid the emperor’s displeasure Dol-po-pa “stayed in different isolated areas for four years.”b In 1358, at the age of sixty-six, he departed from Jo-nang for a visit to Hla-sa. Along the way, he gave teachings to the Fifteenth Patriarch of Sa-kya, Sö-nam-gyel-tsen,c who requested that he compose The Great Calculation of the Doctrine, which has the Significance of a Fourth Council,d along with his own commentary. Dol-po-pa audaciously titled his work this way because he considered the doctrine of other-emptiness and its implications for the Buddha-nature to be like an addition to the famous three councils in India. After six months, when leaving Hla-sa to return to Jo-nang, he was thronged by believers, and again, along the way he taught huge crowds and received the praise of monastic leaders.

Less than fifteen years after his death, the influential Sa-kya scholar Ren-da-wa Shön-nu-lo-dröb over three readings of the text first found it unappealing, then appealing, and then unappealing. Ren-da-wa’s student, Tsong-kha-pa found it so provocative that he took Dol-po-pa’s views as his chief opponent in his works on the view of emptiness. Dol-po-pa developed a new doctrinal language through an amalga-mation of the classical texts of the Mind-Onlyc and Middle Wayd sys-tems of India into a Great Middle Way,e and he also intertwined the par-ticular vocabulary of the Kālachakra system. In what are typically con-sidered the classical texts of separate systems, he saw presentations of multiple systems crowned by the Great Middle Way, which he declared to be concordant with Ultimate Mind-Only,f or Supramundane Mind-Only,g which is beyond consciousness.h Not just in sūtras and tantras but also in Indian treatises—usually taken to strictly present doctrines of the Mind-Only School—he found passages teaching Mind-Only and others teaching the Great Middle Way. He also criticized the then (and still) popular notion that recogni-tion of conceptions themselves as the body of attributesi of a Buddha would alone bring about enlightenment,j without requiring abandon-ment of any misconceptions.k Thus he was bucking two popular trends—(1) separation of the classical Indian texts of the Great Vehicle into isolated systems along with putting Sūtra and Tantra in isolated camps and (2) reduction of the final path to self-recognition of basic mind amidst conceptuality.               a Ibid., 34-35. b red mda’ ba gzhon nu blo gros, 1349-1412. c sems tsam pa, cittamātra. d dbu ma pa, madhyamaka. e dbu ma chen po, mahāmadhyamaka. f don dam pa’i sems tsam.

Tsong-kha-pa emphasized philosophical controversies between schools that are evident in these same texts. Writing a book under the rubric not of intertwining texts but of distinguishing them, he titled it Treatise Differentiating Interpretable and Definitive Meanings: The Essence of Eloquencea—even the name of which can be seen to be in response to Dol-po-pa’s Mountain Doctrine, Ocean of Definitive Meaning. Tsong-kha-pa’s sense that the separateness of many textsb needed to be emphasized comes to life when we consider the context of his reaction to Dol-po-pa’s synthesis.

Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen’s Views Self-emptiness For Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen, there are two types of emptiness—self-emptiness and other-emptiness. He calls the first empty-emptiness, whereas he calls the second non-empty-emptiness,a because it is not self-empty. Self-emptiness means that conventional phenom-ena are empty of their own entities. Such phenomena cannot withstand analysis, for he says (Mountain Doctrine, 213), “subjects that cannot withstand analysis and finally disintegrate are empty of their own enti-ties.” Does this mean that an object is empty of itself ? Is a table empty of a table, and a consciousness empty of a consciousness, and so forth? If so, would this mean that a table is not a table and that a conscious-ness is not a consciousness, and hence that tables and minds do not ex-ist? In the Mountain Doctrine (214) Dol-po-pa quotes the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra,b which clearly says that cows and horses exist: Child of lineage, as you propound, a horse does not exist in a cow, but it is not suitable to say that a cow does not exist, and a cow does not exist in a horse, but it is not suitable to say that even a horse does not exist. From this, it seems that ordinary phenomena do indeed exist. Also, some passages in the Mountain Doctrine limit the scope of the negation by qualifying that these phenomena do not appear to wisdom of reality, for Dol-po-pa speaks of their not existing in the mode of sub-sistence (Mountain Doctrine, 527-528): [Vasubandhu’s] Commentary on the Extensive and Middling Mothers and so forth also say that because in the mode of subsistence these imputational three realms are utterly non-existent like the horns of a rabbit, they do not appear to a consciousness of the mode of subsistence, just as the horns of a rabbit do not ap-pear to an unmistaken consciousness. and (Mountain Doctrine, 535-536): That the noumenon exists in the mode of subsistence and that               a Hopkins, Mountain Doctrine, 213, 252, 301. b yongs su mya ngan las ’das pa chen po’i mdo, mahāparinirvāṇasūtra; P787-789, vols. 30-31."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272   Comparison   phenomena do not exist in the mode of subsistence are set forth in many elevated, pure scriptural systems such as Mai-treya’s Differentiation of the Phenomena and Noumenon and so forth. If you are skilled in the thought of the similar, extensive statements of existing and not existing in the mode of subsis-tence such as: • the ultimate exists, but the conventional does not exist • nirvāṇa exists, but cyclic existence does not exist • true cessation exists, but the other three truths do not exist • the noumenal thoroughly established nature exists, but the other natures do not exist • thusness exists, but other phenomena do not exist • external and internal adventitious defilements do not exist, but the alternative supreme matrix-of-One-Gone-to-Bliss exists, you will know them within differentiating well existence and non-existence. By qualifying non-existence with “in the mode of subsistence” he sug-gests that ordinary phenomena indeed exist but not ultimately. However, at other points Dol-po-pa seems to indicate that not ex-isting in the mode of subsistence means that conventional phenomena only provisionally exist in a way that is equivalent to not existing. He recognizes that this position has many consequences and carefully de-fends it against criticism: 1. He says that these phenomena exist only for consciousness,a which is necessarily mistaken, and thus what appears to pristine wisdomb does not appear to consciousness and what appears to conscious-ness does not appear to pristine wisdom (Mountain Doctrine, 527): Also, the statement in Vasubandhu’s Principles of Expla-nation: Awakened from the sleep of ignorance And spread intelligence also to what is to be known, and so forth establishes that these three realms, which are appearances of ignorance, do not appear to the pristine wisdom of one awakened from the sleep of               a rnam shes. b yes shes."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   273   ignorance because these three realms are appearances of consciousness and whatever is consciousness is igno-rance. Vasubandhu’s] Extensive Commentary on the Perfec-tion of Wisdom Sūtra in One Hundred Thousand Stanzas also says that just as when awakened from sleep, dream ap-pearances, which dawn in sleep, fade away, so these three realms, which are like dreams, do not appear to pristine wisdom for one awakened from the sleep of ig-norance. 2. Dol-po-pa says that these phenomena appear “in the perspective of mistake,” that is, only in the perspective of a mistaken conscious-ness (Mountain Doctrine, 537): Therefore, these mistaken karmic appearances of sen-tient beings are the private phenomenaa just of sentient beings; they utterly do not occur in the mode of subsis-tence, like the horns of a rabbit, the child of a barren woman, a sky-flower, and so forth. Consequently, they are not established even as mere appearances to a cog-nition of the mode of subsistence, and appearing in the face of mistake does not fulfill the role of appearing in the mode of subsistence. In consideration of these [points], it is again and again said in many formats that all phenomena are not observed, non-appearing, unap-prehendable, and so forth. 3. These mistaken phenomena do not even appear to a pristine wis-dom that has extinguished mistakenness (Mountain Doctrine, 525-526): It is not reasonable for these to appear to a pristine wis-dom in one for whom ignorance and imputation have been extinguished, just as falling hairs, a yellow conch, and so forth do not appear to those whose eyes are flawless. For Āryadeva’s Middle Way Conquest over Mis-take also says: When the eye of intelligence is opened and the undefiled pristine wisdom of a One-Gone-to-Bliss dawns like awakening upon separating from the sleep of the predispositions of igno-rance, nothing at all is perceived because an               a sgos chos."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"274   Comparison   entity of things is not observed. and when, upon the dawning of the sun of the correct pristine wisdom knowing emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, all predispositions of non-knowledge and the afflictive emotions that make the connection [be-tween lives] are cleared away, minds and mental fac-tors as well as their objects of activity are not perceived and not observed as actualities and entities because, when the unsurpassed pristine wisdom dawns, the great rest is attained. Having in that way indicated through reasoning that all phenomena conventionally are like dreams, fal-ling hairs, and visual illusions and ultimately those are non-things, clear light, non-appearing, and devoid of proliferations, he also indicates such through scrip-tures. The holy master says that just as when one has awakened from sleep, dream appearances vanish and just as when the eyes become free from visual defect, appearances of hairs and so forth vanish, so to pristine wisdom—cleared of the sleep of ignorance and devoid of the visual cloudiness of consciousness—the phenom-ena of the three realms, minds and mental factors as well as their objects and so forth do not appear, be-cause for pristine wisdom those as well as their seeds have stopped, been extinguished, and have vanished. 4. Dol-po-pa finds the perception of what exists in fact to be contra-dictory with perceiving what does not exist in fact, and thus if pris-tine wisdom, which has removed mistakenness, perceived the de-sire, form, and formless realms, which do not exist in fact, it would very absurdly follow that it does not perceive the noumenon, which abides in fact. Since these three realms have not passed be-yond consciousness, if they did appear to such pristine wisdom, it would very absurdly follow that pristine wisdom would not have passed beyond consciousness, in which case it would not be a pris-tine wisdom perceiving the real.

A consequence of the non-appearance of ordinary phenomena to pristine wisdom is that these phenomena do not appear to Buddhas. Dol-po-pa accepts this but holds that Buddhas are still omniscient, since they implicitly know these phenomena, in which case the phenomena themselves do not have to appear. He explains implicit realization in this context to mean that when Buddhas know the ultimate, they know that these phenomena do not exist and in this way know them (Mountain Doctrine, 532-534): Objection: In that case, a Buddha’s pristine wisdom would not know the phenomena of the three realms, but this contradicts the statements even in the Exten-sive and Medium-Length Mothers and so forth that [a Buddha’s pristine wisdom] knows—just as they are—minds involved with withdrawal, diffusion, and desire and so forth. Answer: There is no fault because, since there are innumerable cases of knowing within not appearing, knowing does not entail appearance [of the object], like knowing the past and the future, which are separated [from the present] by many eons, and knowing self-lessness and so forth, even though those do not appear.

Therefore, upon explicit appearance of the basis devoid of all phenom-ena—the noumenal thoroughly established nature—it is implicitly known that phenomena do not exist, whereby that is called “knowing all phenomena.” Also, when such is seen, the real meaning of great signifi-cance is seen. In consideration of these [statements] in that way of knowing but not appearing, it is said: Why? Because the Buddhas, knowing, Do not perceive phenomena. This means that phenomena are known, although they do not appear. Similarly, [the Verse Summary of the Per-fection of Wisdom] says: The One-Gone-Thus teaches that one who does not see forms, Does not see feelings, does not see discrimina-tions, Does not see intentions, does not see con-sciousness, Mind, or mentality sees reality.

When special insight sees, All are not seen. Because of this and because a conqueror’s pristine wis-dom is the finality of special insight, it is perforce es-tablished that these three realms do not appear to it because these appear to those without special insight. 6. A consequence is that a Buddha’s pristine wisdom has both explicit and implicit realization (Mountain Doctrine, 535): Therefore, the final pristine wisdom perceiving the ul-timate is a valid cognition of explicit realization with respect to knowing that the noumenon exists and is a valid cognition of implict realization with respect to knowing that phenomena do not exist. 7. Dol-po-pa faces an objection, based on scripture, that all phenom-ena whatsoever must appear to a Buddha’s pristine wisdom by ex-plaining away the passage as being metaphorical (Mountain Doctrine, 536): Objection: If these three realms do not appear to a Conqueror’s pristine wisdom, it contradicts: Just as the sun’s emitting one ray Illuminates transmigrating beings, A conqueror’s pristine wisdom simultane-ously Shines to all objects of knowledge.

Moreover, it was proven above that knowledge of the non-existence of phenomena within their non-appearance is the meaning of knowing phenomena. 8. At the end of Mountain Doctrine Dol-po-pa makes it clear that these phenomena do not appear to a Buddha in any way at all, since a Buddha is always in meditative equipoise (538-539): Objection: Although objects do not appear to the meditative equipoise of a conqueror’s pristine wisdom, they appear to [a conqueror’s] pristine wisdom subse-quent [to meditative equipoise]. Answer: [A conqueror’s] pristine wisdom is solely only meditative equipoise: • because it is said that [a conqueror’s pristine wis-dom] is always just meditative equipoise, “Though an elephant rises, it is set in equipoise,” and so forth • and the holy Āryadeva also says: Buddhas are always set In equipoise on thusness. Entry into and leaving That inexpressible state does not exist. How could the state subsequent to medita-tive equipoise Be the way pristine wisdom is? If this did occur in them, How would they differ from those who have entered on grounds! Hence, there is never non-equipoise in a Buddha’s pris-tine wisdom. Objection: That contradicts such statements as, “[Buddha] rose from being thoroughly set within,” and “[Buddha] rose from the meditative stabilization.” Answer: Those are solely mere displays. Though [Buddhas] display rising from meditative stabilization,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   279   they do not have unequipoised minds because [their mind] is a pristine wisdom in which the mind-basis-of-all as well as the seeds are utterly extinguished, the continuum of all breaths has stopped, and the two ob-structions as well as their seeds have been utterly ex-tinguished. Therefore, you need to be skilled in the thought also of other such scriptural passages and need to be skilled also in the thought of other [scriptural passages speaking of ] states subsequent [to meditative equipoise in a Buddha]. Self-emptiness is not the ultimate For Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen, self-emptiness is inadequate to being the ultimate truth. He carefully analyzes a sūtra passage that indicates that the ultimate is of a different order of being, beyond the temporary nature of compounded phenomena, which, like hail-stones, may appear solid but quickly disappear. In the Aṅgulimāla Sūtra,a Mañjushrī—the god of wisdom—pretends not to understand emptiness properly, holding that everything, even Buddha qualities, is empty. Aṅgulimāla, a sinner famed for having killed 999 persons and cut off a single finger (aṅguli) from each to make a rosary (māla) who then became a follower of Bud-dha, scathingly corrects the god of wisdom in what can be seen as a genre of comedy (Mountain Doctrine, 210-212): Aṅgulimāla said to Mañjushrī: Mañjushrī, if you are the supreme of those seeing the great emptiness, then what is it to see emptiness? What is the mean-ing of “empty, empty”? O one endowed with great mind, speak quickly; cut off my doubts. Then, the youthful Mañjushrī spoke in verse to Aṅgulimāla: The Buddha is like space; Space is signless. The Buddha is like space; Space is produced signlessly. The Buddha is like space; Space is formless. Attributesb are like space;               a sor mo’i phreng ba la phan pa’i mdo, aṅgulimālīyasūtra; P879, vol. 34. b chos, dharma."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"280   Comparison   The One-Gone-Thus is the body of attributes. Pristine wisdom is like space; The One-Gone-Thus is the body of attributes. Pristine wisdom unapprehendable, unfathomable, Desireless is the One-Gone-Thus. Liberation is like space; Space also is signless. Liberation is the Buddha, One-Gone-Thus. How could you, Aṅgulimāla, understand Empty nothingness! Then, Aṅgulimāla further said this to the youthful Mañjushrī: It is like this: For example, a rain-storm falls from a great cloud, and a person with a childish nature picks up a piece of hail. Thinking that it is a precious vaiḍūrya jewel, the person carries it home and, not dar-ing to hold it due to its great coldness, thinks to treat it as a treasure and carefully puts it into a vase. Seeing that round piece of hail melt, the person thinks, “Empty,” and turns speechless. Similarly, venerable Mañjushrī, one who meditates on extreme emptiness and considers emptiness to be profound uncomfortably sees all phenomena to be destroyed. Even non-empty liberation is seen and considered to be emptiness. It is like this: For example, having thought that a piece of hail is a jewel, the person meditates even on jewels as empty. Likewise, you also consider non-empty phe-nomena to be empty. Seeing phenomena as empty, you also destroy non-empty phenomena as empty. [How-ever] empty phenomena are other; non-empty phe-nomena are other. The tens of millions of afflictive emotions, like hail-stones, are empty. The phenomena in the class of non-virtues, like hail-stones, quickly dis-integrate. Buddha, like a vaiḍūrya jewel, is permanent. The scope of liberation also is like a vaiḍūrya jewel. Space also is Buddha-form; there is no form of any Hearers and Solitary Realizers. The liberation of a Bud-dha also is form. Even if the liberations of Hearers and Solitary Realizers are formless, do not make a discrimi-nation of non-division, saying, “The character of libera-tion is empty.”"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   281    Mañjushrī, an empty home in a built-up city is called empty due to the absence of humans.

Alas, venerable Mañjushrī, acting out the behavior of a bug, you do not know the real meaning of empty and non-empty. The naked onesa also meditate on all as empty. Do not say anything, you bug of the naked ones! Dol-po-pa explains the meaning of the quotation as being that the mere finding that some phenomena are empty does not make all phenomena, such as the great liberation, also empty: The passage from “The Buddha is like space” through “How could you, Aṅgulimāla, understand/ Empty nothingness!” which indicates, in accordance with the assertions of some, that everything is a self-emptiness of nothingness, is an intro-duction by Mañjushrī. [It leads] to [Aṅgulimāla’s] delineating the difference between self-emptiness and other-emptiness, despite the fact that [Mañjushrī actually] knows [the differ-ence]. Then, using the example of a hail-stone becoming non-existent upon melting, Aṅgulimāla teaches that all afflicted and non-virtuous phenomena are empty; this teaches that all that are included among mundane conventional truths are empty of themselves and of [their own] entities. Using the example of a vaiḍūrya jewel, which does not become non-existent upon melt-ing, he teaches that the final liberation, Buddhahood, is not               a gcer bu pa, nirgrantha; the Jainas."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"282   Comparison   empty. This teaches that the ultimate supramundane truth, the body of attributes, is not empty of its own entity. Using the ex-amples of an empty home, an empty vase, and an empty river, he teaches an emptiness of all defects; this teaches that the fi-nal liberation is other-emptiness. All descriptions of non-emptiness—“Liberation is not empty in all respects,” “A Su-pramundane Victor is not empty,” “Non-empty phenomena are other,” and so forth—mean that the ultimate noumenon is not itself empty of itself. The very many statements in other sūtras and tantras of “is not empty” and “non-empty” also are similar. The Superior Mañjushrī knows well both self-emptiness and other-emptiness. However: • for the sake of teaching that those unskillful persons who assert that everything is only self-empty are like the naked ones • and in order to indicate that the proposition that every-thing is self-emptiness is just bug[-like], relative to proposi-tions made within good differentiation of what is and is not self-empty [Aṅgulimāla] says: Venerable Mañjushrī, acting out the behavior of a bug, you do not know the real meaning of empty and non-empty. The naked ones also meditate on all as empty; do not say anything, you bug of the naked ones! and: You also consider non-empty qualities to be empty. Seeing phenomena as empty, you also destroy non-empty qualities as empty and so forth. These are advice and teachings for those who one-pointedly have decided that self-emptiness—which is that sub-jectsa that cannot withstand analysis and finally disintegrate are empty of their own entities—is the final profundity. Dol-po-pa describes self-emptiness as meaning that phenomena, which cannot withstand analysis and are subject to disintegration, are empty of their own entities. Self-emptiness is taught provisionally for those who take such to be the final reality. From this, it is clear that, for him, the actual ultimate truth, other-emptiness, is able to bear analysis and               a That is, phenomena."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   283   is not impermanent. Other-emptiness Dol-po-pa faces the objection that, to the contrary, Āryadeva holds that realization and accustoming to self-emptiness is taught as an antidote to afflictive emotions (Mountain Doctrine, 394): Objection: Āryadeva’s Lamp Compendium for Practice states: All Ones-Gone-Thus possessing an essence of compas-sion—seeing all sentient beings fallen into a whirlpool of suffering, without refuge, and without defender—cause those beings to purify afflictive emotions through thorough knowledge of the nature of afflictive emotions in a conventional manner, and cause them to be thoroughly set in meditative stabilization having an essence of the mode of reality through having cleansed conventional truth also by means of ultimate truth. and so forth. Does this not say that the entities of afflictive emotions are purified through knowledge itself that they are self-empty? Answer: This is in consideration of temporarily suppressing or reducing the pointedness of coarse afflictive emotions be-cause even this very passage says that, in the end, the conven-tional knowledge that afflictive emotions are self-empty must also be purified by non-conceptual pristine wisdom, meditative stabilization actualizing the ultimate. Although self-emptiness does not fulfill the role of the actual ultimate, it has a place in the course of spiritual development as a means to tem-porarily reduce the force of coarse levels of afflictive emotions. Thor-oughgoing release, however, is brought about through wisdom of other-emptiness (Mountain Doctrine, 394): Through merely knowing that things are self-empty one is not released; rather, when one is released from the stirrings of wind and mind, one is released from bondage; mistake as well as mistaken appearances having vanished, pristine wisdom manifests in self-appearance. Dol-po-pa objects to the notion that the ultimate also could be self-empty, since then the ultimate would be empty of itself and thus would not exist at all (Mountain Doctrine, 213-214):"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"284   Comparison   Moreover, if everything were self-empty, then the body of at-tributes of release also would be self-empty, and if that is ac-cepted, it also would be totally non-existent, whereby this would accord with the systems of the [non-Buddhist] Forder naked ones and so forth. The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra... Also, that same sūtra, using the non-existence of a horse in a cow and the non-existence of a cow in a horse, pronounces that the ultimate noumenon, the great nirvāṇa, is other-empty in the sense of not being empty of itself. It extensively says: Child of lineage, it is thus: Nirvāṇa is not formerly non-existent, like the non-existence of earthenware in clay. It is not non-existent upon ceasing, like earthenware’s non-existence upon being destroyed. It is also not ut-terly non-existent, like the hairs of a turtle or the horns of a rabbit. Rather, it accords with the non-existence of the one in the other. Child of lineage, as you propound, a horse does not exist in a cow, but it is not suitable to say that a cow does not exist, and a cow does not exist in a horse, but it is not suitable to say that even a horse does not exist. Nirvāṇa also is like that; nirvāṇa does not exist in afflic-tive emotions, and afflictive emotions do not exist in nirvāṇa. Hence, it is said to be the non-existence of the one in the other. Based on such passages, Dol-po-pa speaks of the thoroughly established nature not as empty of merely a non-existent object of negation, as Tsong-kha-pa does, but as empty of the other two natures—imputational natures and other-powered natures. If this rule for the ultimate—that if it is self-empty, it would be non-existent—is also to be applied to conventional phenomena, then since they are self-empty, they are decidedly non-existent. However, in the Mountain Doctrine Dol-po-pa does not explicitly extend this rule for the ultimate to the con-ventional. In sum, the ultimate is empty of something other than itself and thus is other-empty. Just as a home is empty of humans, so the great liberation is empty of defects—which are other than itself and do not exist in reality—but it itself is not empty of itself. The great liberation does not melt under examination; it can bear analysis. In this way, other-emptiness, the thoroughly established nature, ultimately exists (Mountain Doctrine, 219-220):"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   285   The imputational nature is empty in the sense of always not ex-isting. Other-powered natures, although tentatively existent, are empty in the sense of not existing in reality; those two are fabricated and adventitious. It is said that the noumenal thor-oughly established nature exists because the emptiness that is the [ultimate] nature of non-entities [that is, the emptiness that is the ultimate nature opposite from non-entities]—due to be-ing just the fundamental nature—is not empty of its own entity, and it is also said that it does not exist because of being empty even of other-powered natures. Thus, that other-emptiness ultimately exists means that it is able to withstand analysis. Though Dol-po-pa himself does not explicitly say that the ultimate is truly established, or truly existent, the seventeenth-century Jo-nang savant Tāranātha, second only to Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen in Jo-nang estimation, repeatedly uses this vocabulary in his short presenta-tion of the schools of Buddhism, The Essence of Other-Emptiness.

Other-emptiness is an affirming negative, not a non-affirming negative Since the ultimate, although without the phenomena of cyclic exis-tence, is replete with beneficial qualities, it is not a mere absence. In the Mountain Doctrine, Dol-po-pa identifies the ultimate as an affirming negative (nine times), something that implies a positive in place of the negation. For instance (132-133): Earlier statements due to the perspective of trainees that all—liberation and so forth—do not exist, are empty, selfless, and so forth are in consideration of the non-existence of whatsoever [object of negation] in something, whereas later statements of non-emptiness, existence of self, and so forth are in considera-tion of the remainder after the negation. Therefore, the fact that, although earlier and later scriptures seem to be contradic-tory but are, when analyzed well, non-contradictory is because an affirming negative exists as the basis of a non-affirming negative and because a pristine wisdom in which all fundamen-tal qualities are contained abides—in the manner of thorough establishment pervading space—in the basis which from the start is naturally pure and devoid of all defects. and (205-206):"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   291   When, through having yogically made endeavor at the perfec-tion of wisdom, a meditative stabilization that is a union of calm abiding and special insight has been generated, you need to be taught within differentiating existence and non-existence, emptiness and non-emptiness, and so forth, and you need to identify these in accordance with how they abide and how they are: • because all do not abide as non-existent and non-established, and so on, and there exists an affirming nega-tive as the basis of non-affirming negatives—such as non-existence and emptiness and the basis of them • and because an inclusionary elimination abides as the basis of an exclusionary elimination • and because realization that contains all final qualities spontaneously abides in the basis that naturally has aban-doned all defects. Therefore, the third wheel of doctrine is said to be “possessed of good differentiation.” Other-emptiness and the middle wheel of doctrine Although Dol-po-pa recognizes that the middle wheel of doctrine teaches that even the ultimate does not ultimately exist, he explains this away as a technique for developing non-conceptual meditation at a certain level of practice. Dol-po-pa depicts the middle wheel of doctrine and Nāgārjuna’s Collection of Reasonings as presenting the view that phenomena are as unfounded as a flower of the sky, the horns of a rab-bit, and the child of a barren woman in the perspective of their final nature (Mountain Doctrine, 199): About that, in order to realize well the commonly renowned correct view [of self-emptiness], it is necessary to conclude that all phenomena are like a sky-flower because in the mode of abiding they are not anything and are not established as any-thing, like the horns of a rabbit and the child of a barren woman. Since sources for this are well renowned in the middle wheel of Buddha’s word and in Nāgārjuna’s Collection of Rea-sonings and so forth, and since here an exposition on this topic would be too much, I will not write on it.

Therefore [in the second wheel of doctrine, Buddha] was intent on teaching everything as emptiness through many aspects such as everything’s non-existence, non-establishment, void-ness, and so forth but was not intent on differentiating exis-tence, non-existence, and so forth, due to which the second wheel of doctrine is said to be “through the aspect of speaking on emptiness.” However, the middle wheel’s blanket teaching of emptiness and non-existence does not take into account that the ultimate ultimately exists (Mountain Doctrine, 206): In this fashion, the second wheel out of purposeful intent teaches that even what are not self-empty are self-empty, and so on, and is not possessed of good differentiation, that is to say, is not without internal contradictions, and for such reasons [the Sūtra Unraveling the Thought] says that [the second wheel] “is surpassable, affords an occasion [for refutation], requires in-terpretation, and serves as a basis for controversy.” About the third wheel by reason that, opposite from those, it differenti-ates meanings well just as they are, and so forth, [the Sūtra Un-raveling the Thought] says that it “is unsurpassable, does not af-ford an occasion [for refutation], is of definitive meaning, and does not serve as a basis for controversy.” The third wheel, however, clearly differentiates what does and does not truly exist (Mountain Doctrine, 202): The first wheel of doctrine concords with a precursor to medi-tating on the profound definitive meaning of the Great Vehicle; the second wheel of doctrine concords with practicing a special meditative stabilization of equipoise on the profound meaning; and the third wheel concords with profound Secret Mantra identifying—within good differentiation—existence, non-existence, and so forth.

From this viewpoint, he sees the middle and final wheels as differing primarily in terms of clar-ity, not in terms of meaning: Absence of production, absence of cessation, quiescence from the start, and naturally passed beyond sorrow are taught even in the third wheel and are taught in the vajra vehicle. By reason of teaching unclearly [in the middle wheel], clearly [in the third wheel], and very clearly [in tantra], there are great and also very great differences of being obscured, not obscured, and so forth with respect to the meaning of those. Therefore, even the statements of being surpassable or unsurpassable, affording an opportunity [for refutation] or not affording an opportunity, and so forth are due to differences in those texts with respect to whether the final profound meaning is unclear and incom-plete or clear and complete, and so forth, and are not due to the entity of the meaning.a Dol-po-pa sees—as the meaning of a great many pronouncements in Great Vehicle scriptures about non-existence and existence—that the non-existent are conventionalities and the existent is the noumenon (Mountain Doctrine, 222): Here, in accordance with the statement in that way of the meaning of not existing and not not existing, Maitreya’s Differ-entiation of the Middle and the Extremes says, “Not existent, and also not non-existent,” and moreover the thought of all the statements—in a great many stainless texts of the middle way—of being devoid of the extremes of existence and non-existence is that: • Since all dependently arisen conventionalities do not really exist, when one realizes this, one does not fall to an ex-treme of existence and is released from the extreme of su-perimposition. • Since the ultimate noumenon that is beyond dependent-arising is never non-existent, when one realizes this, one does not fall to an extreme of non-existence and is released from the extreme of deprecation.               a He does not explain how the middle wheel could teach what is opposite to the ulti-mate—by proclaiming that the ultimate which is actually not self-empty is self-empty—and yet be unclear and incomplete with respect to the ultimate. Nowadays, some Jo-nang-pas explain that these statements in the middle wheel of doctrine that the ulti-mate also is self-empty merely refer to a conceptualized ultimate."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"294   Comparison   The middle wheel of doctrine requires interpretation both because of its lack of clarity on what does and does not ultimately exist and be-cause it over-extends statements of non-existence to include the ulti-mate. For Dol-po-pa, the final wheel of doctrine clearly teaches a truly established “other-emptiness”—that is, a thoroughly established nature that is empty of imputational natures and other-powered natures—and hence is definitive, whereas the middle wheel does not clearly teach the actual mode of subsistence of phenomena and hence requires in-terpretation. He refers to the third wheel as teaching directly and clearly and to the other two wheels as teaching obliquely by way of in-tentional speech (Mountain Doctrine, 394-395): Consequently, the noumenal ultimate truth—the basis of the emptiness of all phenomena abiding as empty—is the final de-finitive meaning of the profound scriptures, be they those that directly teach clearly or those that teach by way of oblique in-tention. In this way, he is able to frame the three wheels of doctrine as a har-monious whole. Still, he does not obliterate any difference between the teachings of the middle and final wheels. For he holds that the middle wheel of doctrine teaches what is non-empty to be empty—that is, that the ultimate is empty of true establishment—and he says that the mid-dle wheel is even internally contradictory. He repeats this point later (Mountain Doctrine, 364): Similarly, it should be understood that all statements—in these and those texts of the middle wheel of doctrine—of the non-self-empty as self-empty are just of interpretable meaning with a thought behind them. [Understanding] this depends on the lamp of unique quintessential instructions of good differentia-tion [found in the three cycles of Bodhisattva commentaries]. The “purposeful intent of,” or “thought behind,” the second wheel is to draw practitioners into a state of non-conceptual meditative equipoise (Mountain Doctrine, 209-210): Therefore, although the meaning of the last two wheels of doc-trine and of the vajra vehicle is one, when they are practiced, you set in equipoise in the conclusive profound noumenon de-void of proliferation in accordance with the middle wheel, and then when making distinctions in subsequent attainment [after meditative equipoise], you individually discriminate phenom-ena in a correct way, at which time you make identifications"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   295   upon good differentiation in accordance with what is said in the final wheel and in the vajra vehicle. When [this procedure is followed], practice of the meaning of all the scriptures of the Great Vehicle becomes complete, unmistaken, and just thor-oughly pure. Hence, here I will teach within making good dif-ferentiation of: • existing and not existing in the mode of subsistence • emptiness and non-emptiness of its own entity • exclusionary elimination and inclusionary elimination • non-affirming negation and affirming negation • abandonment and realization and so forth in accordance with how these are in the basic dis-position of things. Dol-po-pa’s opinion is that the middle wheel overstates the doctrine of self-emptiness when it extends this to the ultimate, declaring it to be without true existence. Two truths In Dol-po-pa’s system the ultimate is true ultimately, and obscurational truths are true obscurationally, or conventionally (Mountain Doctrine, 342-344): Objection: Since truth does not exist in any phenomenon, the ultimately true does not occur. Answer: That is not so. If something is not true convention-ally, it is not suitable as a conventional truth, and hence that which is a conventional truth is conventionally true and is not ultimately true. Just so, if something is not ultimately true, it is not suitable as an ultimate truth, and hence that which is an ul-timate truth is ultimately true and is not conventionally true. Furthermore, that which is the ultimate truth is ultimately true because: • the honorable Superior Nāgārjuna’s autocommentary,a the Akutobhayā says: Since the ultimate truth is realized by Superiors to be non-erroneous, that which is perceived as the non-production of all phenomena is itself               a Ge-luk-pa scholars do not accept that this is Nāgārjuna’s autocommentary, since it cites Nāgārjuna’s own student, Āryadeva, in it."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"296   Comparison   ultimately true for them themselves, whereby it is the ultimate truth. • and [a sūtra cited therein] says, “Monastics, it is thus: this non-deceptive phenomenon, nirvāṇa, is the supreme of truths.” • and the master Avalokitavrata, in his Commentary on (Bhā-vaviveka’s) “Lamp for (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Wisdom’,” also quotes those same words • and Buddhapālita’s Commentary on (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle” also quotes those same words and says, “Fur-thermore, truth is one; there is no second.” • and Nāgārjuna’s Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning also says: When the conqueror said That only nirvāṇa is a truth, What wise person would think, “The rest are not unreal”?... • and the Shrīmālādevī Sūtra also says, “The truth of the cessa-tion of suffering itself is—in reality—true, permanent, and a refuge.” • and Chandrakīrti’s middle way Clear Words also says, “The Supramundane Victor said, ‘Monastics, this is the ultimate truth—nirvāṇa having the attribute of non-deceptiveness.’” • and profound Secret Mantra texts also have extensive statements as in: Endowed with the truth And abiding in the manner of the two truths. and so forth.

Furthermore, despite suggestions that conventional phenomena are only diseased phenomena to be transcended, there are conven-tional types of four of the five pristine wisdoms of a Buddha (Mountain Doctrine, 456-457): Similarly, the pristine wisdom of the pure element of attributes is only ultimate, whereas there are compounded and uncom-pounded [types] with regard to the four—the mirror-like wis-dom and so forth—whereby it should be known that there are conventional [ones] and there are also ultimate [ones]. Conventional form bodies, unlike ultimate form bodies, are imperma-nent (Mountain Doctrine, 448): Conventional form bodies are endowed with correct pristine wisdom, the non-perverse thoroughly established nature; they are endowed with the Great Vehicle pristine wisdom of a non-learner that is not beyond momentariness. Tāranātha gives a brief summary of which Buddha qualities are ul-timate and which are conventional:a Therefore, the pristine wisdom of the element of attributes necessarily is only an ultimate truth; although the other four pristine wisdoms are mainly the primordially abiding ultimate, each in a minor way has conventional portions that are newly attained through having cultivated the path. The ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and so forth also are similar to those [four pristine wisdoms in mainly being the primordially abiding ul-timate, but each in a minor way has conventional parts that are newly attained through having cultivated the path]. The quali-ties of exalted body (the marks, the beauties, and so forth) and the qualities of exalted speech (the sixty branches [of vocaliza-tion] and so forth) each equally has conventional and ultimate portions. Likewise, the nature body is only ultimate; the body of attributes is mostly ultimate; the two, the complete enjoy-ment body and emanation bodies, have equal portions when a division of actual and imputed types is not made; moreover, the appearances of exalted activities in others’ perspectives are conventional, whereas the pristine wisdom of capable power is ultimate.               a Tāranātha, The Essence of Other-Emptiness, 95-96."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"298   Comparison   Hence, all exalted body, pristine wisdom, qualities, and ac-tivities that are included within the ultimate abide primordially in the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus. When a person is Buddhafied, those are not newly attained and are merely separated from de-filements obscuring them, but those that are conventional are newly attained. In past Buddhas and in future Buddhas those that are ultimate are one entity, and even those that are con-ventional are indivisible in nature upon attaining Buddhahood and thereafter but at the point of attainment are different; hence, they are unpredicable as either the same or different.a In this way, Tāranātha shows the multiple viewpoints in which these two types of qualities are the same and/or are different. Relationship of the two truths Dol-po-pa clearly holds that the ultimate exists and is an object of knowledge (Mountain Doctrine, 241): Likewise, the Tantra of the Supreme Original Buddha also speaks of it as being the ultimate object of knowledge and also the ulti-mate mind with: That object of knowledge seen here, Unproduced and unceasing, Is none other than one’s own mind. The two truths, obscurational/conventional and ultimate, are different and are not the same entity (Mountain Doctrine, 404-405): An emptiness of allb does not occur because an emptiness of the noumenon does not occur. A basis of the emptiness of all phe-nomenac occurs; it is the noumenon. A basis empty of the noumenond does not occur because that is damaged by im-measurable, great, absurd consequences.

Those who consider that they are the same or different Are improperly oriented. Answer: That passage refutes that the two truths are the same entity or different entities because although ultimate en-tities are established in the mode of subsistence, conventional entities are not established [in the mode of subsistence]. Hence, the two truths are neither one nor one entity. They are differ-ent, though not different entities. Hence, an ultimate truth is not an obscurational truth, and an obscurational truth is not an ultimate truth. Their difference means simply that they are not the same entity. The ultimate is other than lowly conventionalities (Mountain Doc-trine, 389-391): Similarly, without the flaws of a combination of contradictions many scriptural statements—speaking of body without body, existence without existence, wondrous form without form, the aspectless endowed with all aspects, and so forth—again and again teach the profound ultimate other-emptiness, the basis of emptiness, beyond worldly examples....The Revelation of the Thought Tantra... and Glorious Union of All Buddhas... extensively speak of natural, fundamental, noumenal, naturally pure ag-gregates, constituents, and so forth—which primordially are bases of emptiness of fabricated, adventitious aggregates, con-stituents, and so forth—alternative, supreme, transcendent, and ultimate. In this way, ultimate truths are other than these lowly external and internal conventionalities; they are tran-scendent, ultimate, and supreme.

As is the internal, so is the alternative. It is said that just as although the external husk of a grain, the internal part, and the essence of the grain are not the same en-tity, but abide similarly in terms of aspect, so although this ex-ternal world of the container-environment, the internal sen-tient beings who are contents, and the alternative matrix-of-One-Gone-to-Bliss, thusness, are indeed not the same entity, they are similar in aspect. This mode abides as equivalent also to the statement in other texts of the great middle: Just this as it appears is conventional. The counterpart is other. “Just this as it appears” [means that] these externals and inter-nals appearing to consciousness are conventionalities. That which is “other” than these is the ultimate noumenal, which is other than these conventional phenomena—transcendent or the ultimate of the supreme. From between the two truths, ul-timate truth is the counterpart to conventional truths; there-fore, it is called “the counterpart.” Thus this statement that whatever are ultimates are other than conventionalities also clears away the assertion by some that the two truths are un-differentiable. The otherness of the two truths eliminates the possibility that some-how they are undifferentiable. Though the two truths are different, their difference is not that conventionalities are appearances and their emptinesses are ultimate truths, since the ultimate also appears to pristine wisdom and since conventionalities are self-empty (Mountain Doctrine, 391): Furthermore, those who assert that these things appearing to consciousness are conventionalities and the factors of their emptiness of themselves are ultimate truths are extremely mis-taken: • because it is impossible for those that are self-empty to be ultimate truths and it is impossible for those that are ulti-mate truths to be self-empty • and because many pure sources for those have been set forth and will be set forth."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   301   Similarly, the assertion that all whatsoever appearances are conventionalities and all whatsoever emptinesses are ultimates also is babble because since both appearance and emptiness are contained in conventionalities and both appearance and emp-tiness are contained in ultimates, this [assertion] is harmed by the absurd consequence that even the appearance of the noumenon would be a conventionality and by the extreme ab-surdity that conventional emptiness [that is, self-emptiness] would be ultimate. The ultimate is not a dependent-arising For Dol-po-pa, dependent-arisings are limited to impermanent phe-nomena produced from causes and conditions, and, therefore, the ulti-mate cannot be a dependent-arising. This seems to contradict Nāgār-juna’s statement that all phenomena are dependent-arisings, but Dol-po-pa explains that it does not, first by showing that the ultimate is necessarily not impermanent and deceptive through citing a Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra, the Sūtra Unraveling the Thought, the Shrīmālādevī Sūtra, and Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle, Called “Wisdom” and then by indicating that Nāgārjuna’s reference about the mutuality of dependent-arising and emptiness both here and in his Essay on the Mind of Enlightenment has to be to self-emptiness, not other-emptiness (Moun-tain Doctrine, 398-400): Objection: Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle, Called “Wisdom” says: Because there are not any phenomena That are not dependent-arisings, There are not any phenomena That are not empty.

It cannot be taught that ultimate truths create effects. and so forth and also in the Sūtra Unraveling the Thought: Subhūti, it is like this: Thusness, the ultimate, selfless-ness in phenomena does not arise related to causes; it is not compounded; it also does not become non-ultimate. An ultimate other than that ultimate is not to be sought. In permanent, permanent time and in everlast-ing, everlasting time, whether Ones-Gone-Thus arise or do not arise, the noumenon of phenomena, the basic element that is the abode of attributes only abides; it is not otherwise. and so forth. Moreover, if ultimate truths were not beyond de-pendent-arisings, even final true cessations would not be be-yond dependent-arisings. And if that is asserted, they would not be beyond compounded phenomena, in which case they would most absurdly have the attributes of impermanence, fal-sity, and deceptiveness and would not be final sources of ref-uge. This is because the Shrīmālādevī Sūtra says: Supramundane Victor, among these four noble truths, three truths are impermanent, and one truth is perma-nent. Why? Supramundane Victor, it is because the three truths are included in what have the characteris-tic of being compounded, and, Supramundane Victor, those included in what have the characteristic of being compounded are impermanent. Those that are imper-manent have the attribute of falsity, deceptiveness. Su-pramundane Victor, those that are impermanent have the attribute of falsity—deceptiveness—and are untrue, impermanent; they are not a refuge. Supramundane Victor, consequently, the noble truths of suffering, source of suffering, and path going to the cessation of suffering are, in reality, untrue and impermanent; they"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   303   are not a refuge. Supramundane Victor, among those [four truths], one truth, [the cessation of suffering,] is beyond the realm of the character of the compounded. Supramundane Victor, that which is beyond the realm of the character of the compounded is permanent. Whatever is permanent has the attribute of non-deceptiveness. Supramundane Victor, that which has the attribute of non-deceptiveness is true, permanent, and a refuge. Supramundane Victor, consequently, among these the truth of the cessation of suffering it-self is—in reality—true, permanent, and a refuge. Su-pramundane Victor, the truth of the cessation of suffer-ing, which is beyond the objects of consciousness of all sentient beings, is inconceivable; it is not the domain of knowledge of Hearers and Solitary Realizers. and Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle, Called “Wis-dom” also says: The bhagavān said that whatsoever phenomena Are deceptive are falsities. All compounded things are deceptive phenomena. Therefore, those are falsities. and a passage cited in the commentaries on that also says, “All compositional things have the attributes of falsity and decep-tiveness,” and so forth, at length. Consequently, although whatever are compounded dependent-arisings are necessarily empty, those who assert that all whatsoever emptinesses are dependent-arisings are mistaken because although the ultimate emptiness is beyond dependent-arising, it is the profound very final emptiness. Dol-po-pa openly faces an objection that this would contradict the fre-quently made statement that conventionalities and emptinesses are mutually pervasive by answering that in such a context “emptiness” refers to self-emptiness, not other-emptiness (Mountain Doctrine, 400-401): Objection: Well then, this contradicts [Nāgārjuna’s state-ment in the Essay on the Mind of Enlightenment]: Conventionalities are described as emptinesses, And just emptinesses are conventionalities"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"304   Comparison   Because it is definite that without the one, the other does not occur, Like product and impermanent thing. Answer: There is no fault because emptiness on this occa-sion is dependently arisen self-emptiness, and he is indicating that it is a mutually pervasive single entity with dependent-arising, and we also assert this in that way. For Dol-po-pa also, all conventionalities are self-empty, or self-emptinesses—the two terms being used interchangeably—and thus self-emptiness is a conventionality, not the ultimate. Third category Dol-po-pa holds that the ultimate—since it is an object of pristine wis-dom—is an object of knowledge, and thus he does not resort to a third category with regard to whether it is or is not an object of knowledge. Also, as detailed above, he holds that the two truths are different, and whatever exists must be either an ultimate truth or an obscurational truth. However, he uses the notion of a third category in other con-texts, for he holds that the ultimate is not a wing of a dichotomy be-tween existing as an effective thing and not existing as an effective thing, since it is neither (Mountain Doctrine, 338): Hence, those who propound that all objects of knowledge are limited to the two, existing as an effective thing and not exist-ing as an effective thing, are reduced to only not having real-ized the ultimate mode of subsistence, since although it is an object of knowledge, it does not either exist as an effective thing or not exist as an effective thing. Consequently, it is also established as just a third category and the center or middle. and (346): Similarly, that: • a non-fallacious combination of contradictions does not oc-cur • a third category does not occur with regard to direct con-tradictories [that is, with respect to dichotomies] • objects of knowledge are limited to the two, effective thing and non-effective thing and so forth are in terms of conventionalities, but ultimate"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   305   truths are not included in any of those. The matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus ultimately exists Dol-po-pa’s opinion is that the body of the basic element of attributes exists in the dispositional mode of subsistence, but nothing else does. “Existing in the dispositional mode of subsistence” is the meaning of ultimately existing, and he finds support for this position in the state-ment in Nāgārjuna’s Sixty Stanzas of Reasoninga that “only nirvāṇa is a truth” (Mountain Doctrine, 425): If you know the division of the two truths also with respect to the statements that the bodies of a Buddha bhagavān are one, two, three, four, and so forth, you will not be obscured about the word of the Subduer. Concerning this, the body of the final mode of subsistence, reduced to one, is the ultimate body. It is said that, except for the body of the element of attributes, no phenomenon exists in the dispositional mode of subsistence; [Nāgārjuna’s Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning] says, “Only nirvāṇa is a truth,”b and, “There are no phenomena that are not enlighten-ment,” and: Except for the element of attributes Phenomena do not exist. and: There are no phenomena Except for the element of attributes. and it is said that in the final mode of subsistence there is one truth, the ultimate truth, the noumenal exalted body—without example or parallel, sole, noumenal, manifold within one taste, the exalted body in which knower and known are the same: “The one, having the nature of a vajra—hard, indivisible,” and               a rigs pa drug cu pa, yuktiṣaṣṭikā, stanza 35; Toh. 3825, dbu ma, vol. tsa, 21b.5; Lindtner, Master of Wisdom, 84. b Stanza 35; Toh. 3825, vol. 68, 21b.5; Lindtner, Master of Wisdom, 84.

Dol-po-pa’s focuses on demonstrating that the final object of medi-tation for purifying obstructions is the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus, en-dowed with ultimate Buddha qualities and ultimately existent: • the uncontaminated primordial wisdom empty of all the phenom-ena of cyclic existence • permanent, stable, eternal, everlasting, uncompounded by causes and conditions, and intrinsically possessing the ultimate qualities of a Buddha such as the ten powers. He shows that Nāgārjuna in his Collections of Praises asserts such a ma-trix-of-One-Gone-Thus (Mountain Doctrine, 102-105): Objection: Although others assert the matrix-of-One-Gone-to-Bliss as of definitive meaning, it is not so asserted in the Middle Way School. Answer: The honorable Superior Nāgārjuna, [the foremost proponent of the Middle Way School,] asserts it. His Praise of the Element of Attributes says:a Homage and obeisance to [the sole jewel,] the element of attributes, Definitely dwelling [pervasively] in all sentient beings, Which if one does not thoroughly know [with pristine wisdom], One wanders in the three existences. From having purified [by means of the path the defile-ments of ] just that [element of attributes] Which serves as the cause of cyclic existence [due to be-ing together with adventitious defilements], That very [element of attributes] purified [of defilement] is nirvāṇa.

Similarly, the mind of clear light [which is the nature of all sentient beings] Is obscured by five obstructions— Desire, harmful intent, laziness, Excitement, and doubt. [Therefore, although a Buddha in which all qualities such as the powers and so forth are integrally com-plete exists primordially in all sentient beings, the de-filements are extinguished through striving at the path clearing away obstructions, but the clear light is not consumed; for example,] When a garment [made from a hard mineralc] that is stained With various defilements and to be cleansed [of defile-ment] by fire Is put in fire, its stains Are burned but it is not.               a Cat’s-eye gem. b Dol-po-pa aligns these five respectively with the five obstructors mentioned in the next stanza. c This is likely asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral; I have read about asbestos gar-ments from ancient times but have lost the reference."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   309   So, similarly, with regard to the mind of clear light Which has the stains of desire and so forth, Its stains are burned by the fire of wisdom [on the path] But [since it does not burn the clear light, the qualities of the clear light do not become non-existent the way iron is consumed or worn away, and hence] that [path] does not [burn away] the clear light.

Hence, by way of many examples Nāgārjuna speaks at length of the matrix-of-One-Gone-to-Bliss that is equivalent to the element of attributes, body of attributes, mind of natural clear light, self-arisen pristine wisdom, and so forth. At the beginning of the Mountain Doctrine, Dol-po-pa inspiringly speaks of the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus as the basic reality and pristine wis-dom (61): Just that final Buddha, the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus, the ulti-mate clear light, element of attributes, self-arisen pristine wis-dom, great bliss, and partless pervader of all is said to be the basis and source of all phenomena and also is said in reality to be the basis that is empty of all phenomena, the void basis, and the basis pure of all defilements. It also is said to be endowed with the qualities of the body of attributes beyond the count of the sands of the Ganges River, within an indivisible nature. These ultimate Buddha qualities inherently exist (Mountain Doctrine, 100): The Aṅgulimāla Sūtra, rare as an udaṃvāra flower, also exten-sively says that faulty factors such as production and cessation do not exist inherentlya and that the Buddha-element or ele-mental Buddhab—endowed with multitudes of qualities estab-lished inherently, the endless signs and beauties of the noumenon—exists in all sentient beings. Thus, although Dol-po-pa himself uses the vocabulary of inherent exis-tence and ultimate existence, Tāranātha, as mentioned above, appears to be justified in extending the set of vocabulary to include “true exis-tence.”               a rang bzhin gyis med pa; that is, they do not exist in the basic disposition. b sangs rgyas kyi dbyings sam dbyings kyis sangs rgyas."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   311   Two types of effects: separative and produced Although ultimate Buddha qualities pre-exist in the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus, effort at the spiritual path is nevertheless required because there are two types of effects, separative and produced, and the latter have to be generated through practice. In this way, although Dol-po-pa holds that the basis and the fruit are undifferentiable, he makes the distinction that while a person is still a sentient being, the basis is ob-structed by defilements, and when a person has become a Buddha, the basis has separated from defilements (Mountain Doctrine, 148-151): That all sentient beings nevertheless do not perceive [ultimate qualities] is due to being obstructed by adventitious defile-ments, since those [ultimate qualities] are not objects of con-sciousness and since they are objects of activity just of self-cognizing pristine wisdom. Moreover, the Mahāparinirvāṇa Sū-tra says: Then, the Bodhisattva mahāsattva Lion’s Roar asked: Supramundane Victor, if all sentient beings possess the Buddha-nature which is like a powerful vajra, why is it that all sentient beings do not see it? Buddha said: Child of lineage, for example, although there are different forms—blue, yellow, red, white, long, and short—a blind person does not see them. Such are not seen, but it is not suitable to say that the differ-ences of blue, yellow, red, and white do not exist and that long and short shapes do not exist. Why? Even though a blind person does not see them, it is not that one with eyes does not see them. The Bud-dha-nature is like this. Even though all beings do not see it, Bodhisattvas on the ten grounds see a portion, and a One-Gone-Thus sees it entirely. Bodhisattvas on the ten grounds see the Buddha-nature like a form seen at night. The One-Gone-Thus sees it like a form in daytime. Child of lineage, the semi-blind do not see a form clearly, but when a doctor skilled in medi-cine cures them, through the power of the medi-cine it is clearly seen.

Through the power of the medi-tative stabilization [called] proceeding like a hero, they will see it very clearly. and: There are cases in which it is known but not seen. When it is known that all sentient beings have the Bud-dha-nature, but, overwhelmed and obstructed by afflic-tive emotions, it is not seen, this is called “known but not seen.” Also, there are cases in which it is known and seen a little. Bodhisattva mahāsattvas on the ten grounds know that all beings have the Buddha-nature, but cannot see it clearly; this is like the moon being un-clear during the day. Moreover, there are cases in which it is both seen and known—by Buddhas, Ones-Gone-Thus—this is called “perceived and known.” and: It is not that nirvāṇa did not exist in the beginning but presently exists. If nirvāṇa did not exist in the begin-ning but presently exists, it would not be a phenome-non that always abides. Whether Buddhas arise or do not arise, the nature and character [of nirvāṇa] always abides. Because sentient beings are obstructed by afflic-tive emotions, they do not see nirvāṇa, and hence think, “It does not exist.” Bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have familiarized with ethics, meditative stabilization, and wisdom excise the afflictive emotions and there-upon see it. Hence, nirvāṇa has the quality of always abiding. Since it is known that it is not formerly non-existent and presently existent, it is therefore called “permanent.” and: All sentient beings have the Buddha-nature. Due to be-ing thoroughly veiled by afflictive emotions it is not seen. and so forth, and the Great Drum Sūtra also says: "},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   313   Kāshyapa, these four are examples of causes of obstruc-tions to the basic constituent of sentient beings and ex-amples of reasons [for its existence]. What are the four? Like eyes darkened by yellow and blue eye film; like the moon covered by clouds; like digging a well; like a lamp inside a pot. Kāshyapa, these four are causes and rea-sons for saying, “The matrix exists.” By way of these causes and reasons all sentient beings and all living be-ings have the Buddha-constituent; its adornment, the endless good signs and beauties, will be perceived, and due to that basic constituent sentient beings will attain nirvāṇa. With respect to “one whose eyes are [afflicted] with cataracts,” the eyes, darkened from being covered with yellow and blue film, are suitable to be cured but will be blind until a physician is found, and when a physician is found, will speedily see again. About this basic con-stituent, covered by a sheath of millions of afflictive emotions, like being darkened upon being covered with blue film: as long as one takes a liking to Hearers and Solitary Realizers, the self will not be the self; it will be the self ’s self. When one takes a liking to the Buddha Supramundane Victors, [the self ] becomes the self, and after this, one becomes a human fit for advancement. The afflictive emotions are to be viewed as like that human’s eye disease—the darkness of yellow and blue film. The matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus definitely exists, like the eye. With respect to “like the moon covered by clouds,” just as the sphere of the moon covered by awful clouds is not perceived, the basic constituent covered by a sheath of afflictive emotions is not perceived. When it is separated from the collections of afflictive emotions, like clouds, then the basic constituent, like the full moon, is perceived. With respect to “like digging a well,” when, for ex-ample, a person digs and digs a well, as long as the ground comes up dry, this sign makes the person think, “Water is a long ways from here.” When mud comes up, this sign causes the knowledge, “Water is near here.” When water is arrived at, that is the end of digging."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"314   Comparison   Similarly, Hearers and Solitary Realizers please the Ones-Gone-Thus and partake of good practices, whereby they dig out the afflictive emotions.

With respect to “like a lamp inside a pot,” just as the light of a lamp inside a pot is not bright and vivid and does not do anything for sentient beings, so the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus, said to possess limitless good marks and beauties, does not bring about the wel-fare of sentient beings. Just as when the pot is broken, then the lamp brings about the welfare of living beings through its own illumination, so when the afflictive emotions of cyclic existence are consumed due to the intense burning, like a lamp, of the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus abiding in the pot of cyclic existence, which has the covering of millions of afflictive emotions, the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus—like the lamp of a broken pot—brings about the welfare of sentient beings. Through these four reasons it should be understood that just as I have the basic constituent of a sentient be-ing, so all sentient beings also have it. and so forth and: Some, wanting to view the self, asked, “If one looks into the self ’s afflictive emotions and the self ’s beginning and end, will they be found?” The Supramundane Victor said, “They will not.

Thereby, many very profound sūtras set forth many examples for and reasons why although the pure nature, the matrix-of-One-Gone-to-Bliss, always dwells in all sentient beings, it is not seen and is not attained if not separated from adventitious defilements. Thus, there is no question that a process of purification must take place before Buddhahood can be attained.

Ultimate Buddha and Buddha qualities are already present in the noumenon, whereas conventional Buddha and conventional Bud-dha qualities must be attained. Great Middle Way Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen developed a new doctrinal language through an amalgamation of the classical texts of the Mind-Only and Middle Way systems into a Great Middle Way,a and he also intertwined the particular vocabulary of the Kālachakra system. As he says:b Tantras should be understood by means of other tantras. Sūtras should be understood by means of other sūtras. Sūtras should also be understood by means of the tantras. Tantras should also be understood by means of the sūtras. Both should be understood by means of both. In what are usually considered the classical texts of separate systems, he saw presentations of multiple systems crowned by the Great Middle Way. For instance, he considered separate passages of the Sūtra Unravel-ing the Thought, usually considered to be Mind-Only, to present the views of Mind-Only and the Great Middle Way, the latter being concor-dant with Ultimate Mind-Only,c or Supramundane Mind-Only,d which is beyond consciousness.e In his Mountain Doctrine, he takes the following passage from the ninth chapter of the Sūtra Unraveling the Thought to evince the view of the Great Middle Way (235): That which brings about definite emergence [from obstruc-tions] by means of the middle path upon having abandoned the extreme of superimposition and the extreme of deprecation is their wisdom. Also, by way of that wisdom, they also thor-oughly and correctly know, just as it is, the meaning of the doors of liberation with respect to the three doors of libera-tion—emptiness, wishlessness, and signlessness.

They also thoroughly and correctly know, just as it is, the meaning of non-nature with respect to the three non-natures: character-non-natures, production-non-natures, and the ultimate-non-nature. Not just in sūtras and tantras but also in Indian treatises that are usu-ally taken to be strictly Mind-Only he finds passages teaching Mind-Only but others teaching the Great Middle Way. Thus Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen’s synthesis is by no means a col-lage drawing a little from here and a little from there and disregarding the rest. Rather, he had a comprehensive, thorough, and overarching perspective born from careful analysis. For him, others had just not seen what the texts themselves were saying and, instead of that, read into the classical texts the views of single systems. For instance, he says that the mere fact that the three natures and the eight collections of consciousness are taught in Maitreya’s Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes does not make it a Mind-Only text, since these are also taught in sūtras and tantras of the Great Middle Way. He adds (Mountain Doctrine, 235): Furthermore, the meaning of the statement in Maitreya’s Dif-ferentiation of the Middle and the Extremes, “All are just name-only,” contradicts the view of the Mind-Only School. He quotes many sūtras to the same end (Mountain Doctrine, 236-237): Similarly, the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra also says that, for the time being, one is taught mind-only, but finally having thoroughly passed beyond that, one is taught the middle without appear-ance, and that, having also passed beyond this, one is taught the middle with appearance, and it says that if one does not ar-rive at that, one has not seen the profound meaning of the Great Vehicle: Relying on mind-only, One does not imagine external objects. Relying on non-appearance, One passes beyond mind-only. Relying on observing reality, One passes beyond non-appearance. If yogis dwell in non-appearance, They do not perceive the Great Vehicle. In this way, Dol-po-pa’s perspective is syncretic in that he draws from a"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"   Dol-po-pa’s   Views   317   great variety of sūtras, tantras, and treatises. It is synthetic perhaps only in the sense that he finds within these an exposition of a view be-yond the traditional schools. It is not a mere putting together of pieces from here and there. Since he breaks boundaries between set systems, it is no wonder that his grand, overarching, iconoclastic perspective shocked many Tibetan scholars and attracted others from his own day to the present. It offers so much provocative food for thought that it has to be taken into account."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":" 319 2. Tsong-kha-pa Lo-sang-drak-pa’s Rebuttal Tsong-kha-pa’s writings on the view of emptiness deliberately differ markedly from those by Dol-po-pa. Both implicitly and explicitly he rebuts his predecessor’s opinions, even though he never mentions Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen by name. Making distinctions in basic termi-nology, he reveals his own overarching perspective on the Middle Way view. Not all ordinary consciousnesses are wrong Dol-po-pa’s perspective is that the phenomena of the three realms exist only for consciousness,a which is necessarily mistaken, as when he says (above, 273), “these three realms are appearances of consciousness and whatever is consciousness is ignorance.” To counter this and to estab-lish that conventional consciousnesses can be valid, Tsong-kha-pa dis-tinguishes between three types of awarenesses with regard to the ap-prehension of true, or inherent, existence (above, Insight, 57): In brief, when the many supreme scholars who commented on the meaning of the scriptures on the profound [emptiness] de-lineated the meaning of suchness, they analyzed by way of scripture and reasoning. They did this from having perceived that selflessness and emptiness cannot be realized without see-ing that the self as apprehended by erroneous apprehension does not exist and without seeing the emptiness of that self. It is important to gain ascertainment with respect to this. For if you do not meditate on the meaning of the negation of the erroneous object that is the root of being bound in cyclic existence, even though you meditate on the meaning of some-thing else that you consider to be profound, it will not harm the apprehension of self at all: • because unless the mind becomes absorbed in the suchness of selflessness and emptiness, conquest of the apprehen-sion of self cannot occur, and • because without rejecting the object of the apprehension of self, although you perform the mere withdrawal of the mind that moves there to its object, this cannot constitute being absorbed in selflessness.               a rnam shes."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"320   Comparison   The reason for this is that there are three modes of the mind’s operating on an object—(1) apprehending the object of obser-vation to truly exist, (2) apprehending it to not truly exist, and (3) apprehending it without qualifying it with either of those. Hence, just as although one is not apprehending [an object] as not truly existent, one is not necessarily apprehending it as truly existent, so, although one is not involved in the two selves, it is not necessary that one is involved in the two self-lessnesses. For there are limitless minds abiding in the third category. Tsong-kha-pa’s opinion is that when the “I,” for instance, is appre-hended, there are basically three possibilities with respect to how it is being apprehended in relation to true, or inherent, existence: 1. One may be apprehending the “I” to be inherently existent. 2. Or, if one has understood the view of the Middle Way School, one may apprehend the “I” as only being nominally existent. 3. Or, whether one has understood the view of the Middle Way School or not, one may apprehend the “I” without qualifying it with either inherent existence or an absence of inherent existence. In this vein, the Fifth Dalai Lama’s Sacred Word of Mañjushrī says:a Furthermore, consciousnesses innately apprehending “I”—which conceive an “I,” or self, based on the [nominally existent] person—are of three types: 1. A conceptual consciousness [correctly] apprehending “I” that exists in a person who has generated the Middle Way view in his/her mental continuum. This consciousness [correctly] apprehends “I” taken to be qualified as being only designated in the context of its basis of designation [the mental and physical aggregates]. 2. An actual innate [consciousness mis]apprehending “I” taken to be qualified as being inherently existent. It is to be overcome through its antidote here on this occasion [of the path of wisdom].               a Nga-wang-lo-sang-gya-tso (ngag dbang blo bzang rgya mtsho, 1617-1682), Dalai Lama V, Instruction on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Sacred Word of Mañjushrī (byang chub lam gyi rim pa’i khrid yig ’jam pa’i dbyangs kyi zhal lung) (Thimphu: kun-bzang-stobs-rgyal, 1976), 182.5-210.6.

A conventional validly cognizing consciousness that estab-lishes [the existence of ] “I.” This consciousness exists [for example] in the continuums of those common beings whose mental continuums have not been affected by sys-tems of tenets and who thus do not differentiate between nominal imputation and inherent existence. In this case, the “I” is not taken to be qualified as being either nominally imputed or inherently existent. In Tsong-kha-pa’s system, though uneducated common beings do not propound either inherent existence or nominal imputation, the “I” ap-pears to them to be inherently existent, and because they sometimes assent to that appearance—though without reasoning—they also have a consciousness apprehending an inherently existent “I.” Moreover, they, like all other beings, even including those who have been edu-cated in wrong systems of tenets, have consciousnesses that do not en-gage in apprehensions of inherent existence, such as when just appre-hending themselves without any particular attention. Thus, in the continuum of uneducated persons some conscious-nesses apprehending “I” or other phenomena of the three realms are right, and some are wrong. Moreover, even in the continuum of a falsely educated person some consciousnesses apprehending “I” or other phenomena are right. In Tsong-kha-pa’s system, both the unedu-cated and the falsely educated have misapprehensions of an inherently existent “I” and other phenomena as well as consciousnesses appre-hending these without qualifying them as being either nominally im-puted or inherently existent. In this way, Tsong-kha-pa makes room for correct consciousnesses that can certify the existence of common phe-nomena, and on this platform he holds that common phenomena are established by valid cognition. Nevertheless, for Tsong-kha-pa, since the objects of all three types of consciousness mentioned above appear to exist inherently, all three are mistaken with respect to their appearing objecta but not necessarily mistaken with respect to their object of operationb because they do not necessarily apprehend that the object inherently exists. This distinc-tion allows him to hold that in the continuum of anyone but a Buddha a validly cognizing consciousness, such as an eye consciousness appre-hending blue—while valid and hence not a wrong consciousnessc—is               a snang yul. b ’jug yul.

An eye consciousness apprehending blue as blue is non-deceived about its main object and, therefore, is a valid cognition, and even though the patch of blue ap-pears to it to exist inherently, the eye consciousness itself does not mis-takenly apprehend, or conceive, blue to be inherently existent; it does not affirm the false appearance of inherent existence. From the view-point of its object of operation, which is just the patch of blue, it is non-mistaken, even if it is mistaken with respect to its appearing object. This is how Tsong-kha-pa can have validity and mistake in the same consciousness. Thus, for both Dol-po-pa and Tsong-kha-pa all or-dinary consciousnesses are mistaken, but Tsong-kha-pa, by making a distinction between the appearing object and the object of operation, holds that the mistaken can be valid. Despite his emphasis on valid cognition in the continuums of ordi-nary beings, Tsong-kha-pa asserts that neither the falsely educated nor the uneducated can distinguish between imputedly existent objects and inherently existent objects. Both must become educated in the Middle Way view of the absence of inherent existence and the presence of im-puted existence in order to overcome the innate tendency to assent to the false appearance of the “I” and other phenomena as if inherently existent, that is to say, existing from their own side and existing under their own power. This is the immediate purpose of meditation on self-lessness. Saṃvṛti does not just mean obscurer Dol-po-pa considers conventional objects to exist only in the perspec-tive of mistaken consciousness (above, 273):a Therefore, these mistaken karmic appearances of sentient be-ings are the private phenomenab just of sentient beings; they utterly do not occur in the mode of subsistence, like the horns of a rabbit, the child of a barren woman, a sky-flower, and so forth. Consequently, they are not established even as mere ap-pearances to a cognition of the mode of subsistence, and ap-pearing in the face of mistake does not fulfill the role of appear-ing in the mode of subsistence. In consideration of these [points], it is again and again said in many formats that all phe-nomena are not observed, non-appearing, unapprehendable, and so forth.               a I have lengthened the citation here; see Hopkins, Mountain Doctrine, 537-538. b sgos chos."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   323   Objection: In that case, this contradicts Shāntideva’s expla-nation that these appearances of apprehended object and ap-prehending subject are not objects of negation. His Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says: Here these which are seen, heard, And known are not what are negated. Here the conceptualization of truth That is the cause of suffering is just what is to be over-come. Answer: There is no fault: • because [Shāntideva’s] meaning is that “Since it is not con-tradictory for those to be untrue in the mode of subsistence but to appear in the face of mistake, do not deprecate the appearance of those conventionally”; he is not indicating that those appear to a consciousness of the mode of subsis-tence • and because we also do not assert that as long as mistake has not been stopped, mistaken appearances stop. He associates appearing “in the face of mistake”—that is, appearing to a mistaken consciousness—with existing conventionally. It is likely that he takes “existing conventionally” (kun rdzob tu yod pa, saṃvṛtisat) to mean existing for ignorance, since it is generally agreed that in the term “obscurational truth” (kun rdzob bden pa, saṃvṛtisatya), kun rdzob (saṃvṛti) means that which obscures, or conceals, reality, and thus kun rdzob bden pa (saṃvṛtisatya) means “that which is a truth for ignorance,” that is to say, something that an ignorant consciousness takes to exist the way it appears, to have a concordance between the way it appears and the way it is in fact. For Tsong-kha-pa to make the case that conventional objects can be obscurational truths but be validly established, he must distinguish between the saṃvṛti of obscurational truths (kun rdzob bden pa, saṃvṛtisatya) and the saṃvṛti of conventionally existent (kun rdzob tu yod pa, saṃvṛtisat). He justifies the distinction by citing Chandrakīrti and the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra (above, Insight, 109): Chandrakīrti’s Clear Words describes three [meanings] for saṃvṛti—(1) obstructing suchness,a (2) mutually dependent ob-jects,b and (3) worldly conventions.a Since he explains the last               a de kho na nyid la sgrib pa, tattvāvacchādana. b phan tshun brten pa, parasparasaṃbhavana."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"324   Comparison   as having the character of object of expression and means of expression, knower and object of knowledge, and so forth, it is not just subjective conventions—consciousnesses and expres-sions—[but also objects of knowledge and objects of expres-sion]. Nevertheless, [this is not a definition since] not all what-soever objects of knowledge and objects of expression should be held to be obscurational truths [because an emptiness is an object of knowledge and object of expression but is an ultimate truth]. The saṃvṛti that is the obscuring consciousness with re-spect to which forms and so forth are posited as truths [in the sense that ignorance takes them to exist the way they appear to be inherently existent] is the first among the three [meanings]. It is the ignorance superimposing on phenomena the existence of their own inherently established entity, whereas they do not have such. This is because: • true establishment does not occur in objects, and therefore the positing of [objects that appear to be truly existent] as truths is in the perspective of an awareness, and • there is no positing [of objects that appear to be truly exis-tent] as truths in the perspective of a mind that is not an apprehender of true existence. In that way moreover, Chandrakīrti’s Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle” says: The Subduer said that because bewilderment [that is, the apprehension of inherent existence] obscures [di-rect perception of ] the nature [of the mode of subsis-tence of phenomena], [This ignorance] is all-obscuring (kun rdzob) and he said that those fabrications appearing To be true due to this [ignorance] are obscurational truths (kun rdzob bden) [because of being true in the perspective of the obscurational apprehension of in-herent existence]. Things that are fabrications [exist] conventionally (kun rdzob tu). Concerning this, Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on the “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’” says (see also Illumination,                                 a ’jig rten gyi tha snyad, lokavyavahāra."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   325   240): In that way, respectively, obscurational truths are pos-ited through the force of the afflictive ignorance that is included within the [twelve] links [of the dependent-arising] of cyclic existence. Moreover, for Hearer [Foe Destroyers], Solitary Realizer [Foe Destroyers], and [eighth ground] Bodhisattvas, who have [entirely] abandoned afflictive ignorance and who see that [al-though] compositional phenomena [are thoroughly empty of being established by way of their own charac-ter but appear to be established by way of their own character] like the existence of reflections and so forth, these have [only] a fabricated [false] nature and are not truths, because they do not exaggerate [forms and so forth] into being truly [established]. To childish [com-mon beings] these are deceptive, but to the others [that is, to the Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas described above] they are mere conventionalitiesa due to being dependent-arisings, like a magician’s illusions and so forth [appearing to truly exist while not truly existing the way they appear]. This passage does not indicate that (1) the positing of obscura-tional truths as existent is a positing of their existence by igno-rance or (2) that obscurational truths are not posited in the perspective of Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have abandoned afflictive ignorance. The reasons for the first point are: because, as explained before, afflictive ignorance is a consciousness apprehending true existence, due to which the object apprehended by it does not exist even in conventional terms, and because whatever is an ob-scurational truth necessarily exists in conventional terms. Therefore, whatever is the conventionality (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) that is the ground from which phenomena are posited as exist-ing conventionally (kun rdzob tu yod pa, saṃvṛtisat) must be something that is not the afflictive ignorance that is taken as the obscurer (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) [in “obscurational truth” (kun               a Or, “mere fraudulences” (kun rdzob tsam, saṃvṛtimātra)."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"326   Comparison   rdzob bden pa, saṃvṛtisatya)]. The reason for the second point is: Chandrakīrti is establishing that because those who have abandoned the obscurer, afflictive ignorance, do not have the obscurer—a consciousness adhering to true existence—in the perspective of which [objects appearing to exist inherently] are posited as truths, compositional phenomena are not truths for them; he is not establishing that compositional phenomena are not obscurational truths.a Consequently, Chandrakīrti’s statement that compositional phenomena are mere conventionalities for them means that, between conventionality and truth, those are not positable as truths for them, and therefore the term “mere” [in “mere con-ventionalities”] eliminates truth, not obscurational truth. Hence, Chandrakīrti’s thought in speaking of the two—mere conventionality and obscurational truth—should be understood in that way. Tsong-kha-pa affirms that kun rdzob bden pa (saṃvṛtisatya) means “ob-scurational truth” because here kun rdzob (saṃvṛti) means the igno-rance in the perspective of which objects are mistakenly posited to be true, that is, to exist the way they appear. However, he insists that the consciousness in the perspective of which objects are posited as existing is not ignorance, despite the fact that objects are said to be kun rdzob tu yod pa (saṃvṛtisat). He finds support for this in the first line of a passage in the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra, which he cites in his Extensive Explanation of (Chandrakīrti’s) “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’”: Il-lumination of the Thought. He takes the sūtra as using both meanings of kun rdzob (saṃvṛti) (above, 236): Because, through it, sentient beings are obstructed, that is to say, beclouded, with respect to viewing the nature that is how things abide, it is [called] bewilderment. Bewilderment, or ig-norance, which has an essence of obstructing the perception of the nature that is the mode of being [of phenomena through] superimposing inherent existence on the entities of things that do not inherently exist, is the obscurer (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti).               a Even for Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have abandoned afflictive ignorance and who see compositional phenomena as like the existence of reflections and so forth, compositional phenomena are obscurational truths, since they know that others take them to be truths and since these exist but are not ultimate truths."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   327   This is an identification of the obscuring [consciousness] (kun rdzob / kun rdzob pa, saṃvṛti) in the perspective of which truth in [the term] “obscurational truth” is posited; it is not an iden-tification of kun rdzob pa (saṃvṛti) in general [which means “conventionality” or “conventional consciousness”]. Furthermore, that identification [in Chandrakīrti’s Supple-ment] is the meaning of the statement in the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra [above, 189] that an awareness making the mistake that what ultimately lacks inherent existence exists inherently is an obscurational (kun rdzob pa): The production of things [exists] conventionally (kun rdzob tu, saṃvṛtyā); Ultimately it lacks inherent existence. That [consciousness] which is mistaken regarding the lack of inherent existence Is asserted as the obscurer of reality (yang dag kun rdzob, satyaṃ saṃvṛti). Since the Sanskrit original for “obscurer” (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) [does not just mean “convention” but] is also used for “obstruc-tor” (sgrib byed), this obscurer (kun rdzob, saṃvṛti) [in the final line] is an obstructor. What does it obstruct? Since [the sūtra] says that it is “the obscurer of reality (yang dag kun rdzob, satyaṃ saṃvṛti),” it says that since it obstructs [perception of ] the meaning of reality, it is asserted as an obscurer, or obstruc-tor. It is not indicating that it is a right conventionality (yang dag kun rdzob, tathya-saṃvṛti) from between the two [categories of conventionalities], right and wrong [conventionalities]. The [kun rdzob (saṃvṛti) translated as] “conventionally” in-dicated in the first line and the [kun rdzob (saṃvṛti) translated as] “obscurer” indicated in the last line should not be construed to be identical. For, the first is the conventional way in which we ourselves assert things to be produced and so forth, whereas the latter is the obscurer—[a consciousness] apprehending true existence—in the perspective of which things are true [that is, a consciousness taking things to exist the way they appear to in-herently exist]. Through the force of that obstructing [consciousness] ap-prehending true existence, fabricated phenomena such as blue and so forth—which, although lacking inherent establishment, are fabricated to appear to be inherently established and which"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"328   Comparison   appear to sentient beings to be true—are true in the perspec-tive of the worldly, erroneous, obscuring [consciousness] de-scribed above. Hence, they are worldly obscurational truths. The Subduer said such; the way he said this is what is set forth in the above sūtra [that is, the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra]. If everything that exists for ignorance did exist conventionally, then even absurdities such as the offspring of a barren woman or of a sterile man, a permanent creator, and so forth, would have to exist conven-tionally. By holding that kun rdzob tu yod pa (saṃvṛtisat) means conven-tionally existent with kun rdzob (saṃvṛti) in this phrase referring to a conventional valid cognition, Tsong-kha-pa is able to allow for refuting objects that are only imagined to exist. Without mentioning Dol-po-pa by name, Tsong-kha-pa concludes in his Illumination that these distinc-tions refute the opinion that existing for a mistaken consciousness is the meaning of existing conventionally (above, 231): Therefore, entities such as the three qualities as they are im-puted by these Fordersa in their respective texts do not exist even as worldly conventionalities. This refutes well the state-ment that what exists in the perspective of a mistaken aware-ness is posited as conventionally existing by this system. Similarly, the horse or elephant that is imputed to a magi-cal illusion, the water that is imputed to a mirage, the face that is imputed to a reflection, and so forth also just do not exist even from [the viewpoint of ] worldly conventions. In that way, for something to exist conventionally, it must be established by valid cognition. Self-emptiness does not mean an object is empty of itself Dol-po-pa explains that other-emptiness eliminates and is beyond the extremes of non-existence, whereas self-emptiness, despite avoiding the extreme of existence, does not eliminate the extreme of non-existence (Mountain Doctrine, 328-329): This emptiness, which is thus equivalent to the element of at-tributes and so forth, is the meaning of the emptiness of non-entities, other-entity emptiness, and non-empty emptiness mentioned again and again in stainless scriptures. Mere self-emptiness does not fulfill its role. Why? It is because that which               a Such as in the Sāṃkhya system."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   329   is the ultimate emptiness not only clears away the extreme of existence but also clears away the extreme of non-existence—“not existent and not non-existent”—but self-emptiness does not clear away the extreme of non-existence. Concerning this, whereas conventional phenomena do not at all exist in the mode of subsistence, the extreme of existence is the superim-position that they do. Whereas the partless, omnipresent pris-tine wisdom of the element of attributes always abides pervad-ing all, the extreme of non-existence is the deprecation that it does not exist and is not established and is empty of its own en-tity. That which is the middle devoid of those extremes is the basis devoid of all extremes such as existence and non-existence, superimposition, and deprecation, permanence and annihilation, and so forth, due to which it is the final great middle. It is non-material emptiness, emptiness far from an an-nihilatory emptiness, great emptiness that is the ultimate pris-tine wisdom of Superiors, five immutable great emptinesses, six immutable empty drops, a which is the supreme of all letters, Buddha earlier than all Buddhas, primordially released One-Gone-Thus, causeless original Buddha, aspectlessness endowed with all aspects—insuperable and not fit to be abandoned. Not to be deprecated, it is the inconceivable element of attributes beyond phenomena of consciousness and not in the sphere of argument; it is to be realized in individual self-cognition by yogis. Consequently, those who come to the conclusion that: • the “middle” is solely designated to the mere voidness of all extremes • “even the middle is empty of the middle” • “even the ultimate is empty of the ultimate” and so forth do not accord with the thought of the conqueror because, for the character of the emptiness that is the final mode of subsistence, the mere emptiness of non-entities is not sufficient. Rather, the emptiness that is the [ultimate] nature of non-entities [that is, emptiness that is the ultimate nature op-posite from non-entities] is required. Tsong-kha-pa responds that Dol-po-pa has not understood the meaning of self-emptiness; first he states his predecessor’s opinion (see Insight, 97):"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"330   Comparison   Objection: The meaning of the statement that compounded phenomena are empty of their own inherently existent entity is that those phenomena do not have their own entities, whereby this is an annihilatory emptiness. However, since thusness has its own entity, it truly exists. Then Tsong-kha-pa proceeds to make the case that Dol-po-pa has com-pletely misunderstood what is negated in self-emptiness. Whereas Dol-po-pa holds that it is the entities of phenomena themselves that are negated, Tsong-kha-pa holds that it is the inherent existence of those entities: Answer: [The first part of that assertion] is the final place of going wrong with respect to delineating compounded phenom-ena as empty of inherent establishment, a view deprecating the dependent-arising of compounded phenomena. The latter [part of that assertion] is an awful view of permanence superimpos-ing true existence on whatever has its own entity. Therefore, [the proponents of this] are wrongly perspected with respect to the correct meaning of emptiness. If [an object’s] emptiness of its own inherently established entity [meant that] it did not exist in itself, then since not exist-ing in itself [means] that existence would not occur anywhere, holders of the thesis that some phenomena truly exist as well as the scriptures and reasonings proving this, and so forth, would not be established bases [that is, would not exist] due to being empty of their own inherently established entity. There-fore, the positing of a tenet that some phenomena truly exista is an unexamined propounding of whatever appears to mind. In the previous chapter we saw that there is some question as to just how far Dol-po-pa takes the negation in self-emptiness; Tsong-kha-pa, however, indicates that he reads his predecessor as denying the very existence of compounded phenomena. This is hard to square with Dol-po-pa’s assertion that persons do not become Buddhas until the com-pounded qualities of Buddhahood are attained and does not include his frequent statements that conventionalities do not exist in the mode of subsistence, but Tsong-kha-pa’s estimation does reflect tendencies in other parts of Dol-po-pa’s presentation like that given at the head of               a Dol-po-pa Shay-rap-gyel-tsen holds that suchness, the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus, and all of the ultimate Buddha attributes associated with the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus ultimately, or truly, exist, whereas all conventional phenomena are empty of them-selves."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   331   this section. Tsong-kha-pa concludes that (see Insight, 98): Also, with respect to those here [in Tibet] who propound two discordant [positions] regarding suchness, you should through the above explanation, understand well the status of their modes of debate—as to whether the ultimate is ultimately es-tablished or not—in the context of their affinity for the former mode of conventionalities being empty of their own inherently established entity [mistaking this to mean that self-emptiness means that phenomena are empty of themselves and wanting to avoid holding that the ultimate is empty of itself and hence non-existent, which would be a view of deprecatory nihilism]. For the two—(1) [correctly] not asserting true existence with respect to all things and all phenomena, having [properly] re-futed with reasoning true existence in phenomena, and (2) propounding that all things and all phenomena do not truly ex-ist based on an annihilatory emptiness in which the way of un-derstanding emptiness is faulty—are dissimilar in all respects. Tsong-kha-pa attributes Dol-po-pa’s assertion that the ultimate truly exists to his misunderstanding of self-emptiness. Tsong-kha-pa’s position that what is negated in self-emptiness is not the object itself but the inherent existence of the object allows him to hold that self-emptiness is not annihilatory, whereby the ultimate can be a non-affirming negative. The ultimate does not truly exist: “ultimate” in “ultimate truth” and in “ultimately existent” are not the same Contrary to Dol-po-pa’s view that other-emptiness is ultimately estab-lished in the sense that it can withstand analysis, Tsong-kha-pa holds that everything, including the ultimate, is not ultimately established because of not being able to withstand analysis (see Insight, 82): When sought with reasoning analyzing suchness, persons—who are born and transmigrate—and so forth, able to withstand analysis, are not found, not even a particle. and (see Insight, 99): Therefore, when [an ultimate truth] is analyzed with the rea-soning investigating whether it is truly established or not, it is"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"332   Comparison   not truly established in the sense of being able to withstand analysis. To establish that emptiness is the ultimate truth but is not ultimately existent, Tsong-kha-pa distinguishes between the meanings of “ulti-mate” in these two usages. For Dol-po-pa the ultimate truth has to be ultimately existent, for if it were not, it would not exist as the ultimate. Dol-po-pa (for more context see 295 above) holds that: If something is not true conventionally, it is not suitable as a conventional truth, and hence that which is a conventional truth is conventionally true and is not ultimately true. Just so, if something is not ultimately true, it is not suitable as an ulti-mate truth, and hence that which is an ultimate truth is ulti-mately true and is not conventionally true. Tsong-kha-pa responds that Dol-po-pa has failed to make a distinction between: • truly, or ultimately, established in the sense of being able to with-stand analysis, and • ultimately true in the sense of being true for a rational conscious-ness.a Tsong-kha-pa re-explains one of Dol-po-pa’s sources and then openly refutes Dol-po-pa’s opinion by drawing an absurd conclusion (see In-sight, 126): Moreover, with respect to the master Jñānagarbha’s statement [in his Commentary on the “Differentiation of the Two Truths”], “Be-cause of being a truth ultimately, it is an ultimate truth,” since he also describes a rational consciousness as the ultimate, he is saying that what is non-deceptive in its perspective is a truth. His thought is not that [an ultimate truth] is truly established in the sense of being able to withstand analysis because in his text the true establishment of all phenomena is refuted. There-fore: • we accept the proposition that “If an ultimate is not true ultimately [that is, in the perspective of a rational con-sciousness called the ultimate], then a conventionality is not a truth conventionally [that is, in the perspective of a               a rigs shes. This term specifically refers to an inference realizing emptiness or to a con-sciousness of meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness; it does not refer to a consciousness engaged in reasoning in general."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   333   conventional valid cognition],” • but to propound [as Dol-po-pa does] that “If the ultimate is not ultimately established, then a conventionality is not conventionally established,” is to [absurdly] say that if a negative of truth [that is, a negative of true establishment] is not truly established, then the subjects that are the bases of the negation would be truly established. This is because an ultimate truth is posited as just a negative of truth [that is, an absence of true establishment] in the subject that is the basis of negation and because the suggestion that subjects are not established conventionally suggests that they are not falsely established. Thus, [to propound such] would be even extremely senseless because the bases of negation must be established as false due to the very fact that the subjects—appearances—do not exist as truly established, that is to say, are not truly established. In the process of discussing the reasoning probing the relationship between the person and the mental and physical aggregates, Tsong-kha-pa makes the point that whatever is truly established must always appear within the context of its mode of appearance being concordant with how it actually is (see Insight, 67): Concerning that, if the two—the self and the aggregates—are one inherently established entity, from among three fallacies the first damage to this position is that the assertion of a self [or person] would be senseless. If the sameness of entity of those two were inherently established, then they would be-come an utterly indivisible one. This is because if a sameness of entity were ultimately established, then to whatever awareness those two appeared, they would necessarily not appear to be different. The reason for this is that although among falsities—conventionalities—it is not contradictory for the mode of ap-pearance and mode of being to be in disagreement, such is nec-essarily contradictory in what is truly established because the mode of being of what truly exists must appear just as it is to any mind to which it appears. Let us take this a step further. For Tsong-kha-pa, since the ultimate is not truly established and is falsely established, it can appear falsely to an inferential consciousness as if it inherently existed but appear to a wisdom directly realizing it without any falsity whatsoever, that is,"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"334   Comparison   within the context of its mode of appearance being concordant with how it actually is. For Dol-po-pa, the ultimate, other-emptiness, ap-pears only to pristine wisdom, never to consciousness; thus, there is always a concordance between how it appears and how it actually is. It could be said that in this sense he agrees with Tsong-kha-pa about one of the implications of true establishment; however, they disagree on the fundamental point—whether utterly everything is unable to bear analysis. For Tsong-kha-pa, that Dol-po-pa makes an exception for other-emptiness is just foolish (see Insight, 98): Seeing well the implications of the reasoning of this situation, all our own [Buddhist] sects in the country of Superiors [India] who propound that phenomena truly exist are called propo-nents of [truly existent] things since they definitely propound that things truly exist. Once things are propounded as not truly existent, not to assert any phenomenon [as truly existent] ap-pears to be a sign of greatly surpassing those who propound the foolishness of this position [that thusness truly exists]. He finds it pointless and counterproductive to assert that the ultimate truly exists (see Insight, 96): With regard to how it is easy to establish [uncompounded phe-nomena as not truly existent], when the inherent establish-ment of compounded phenomena is refuted as before, it is es-tablished that even though [phenomena] do not inherently ex-ist, it is permissible to posit agents, activities, and objects—bondage and liberation, cause and effect, object comprehended and comprehender, and so forth—with respect to them. When that is established, even though uncompounded phenomena such as the noumenon and analytical cessations also do not truly exist, it is permissible to posit well the presentations of them as the objects of attainment and objects of comprehen-sion of the path, as well as the doctrine jewel that is a source of refuge for trainees, and so forth. Hence, when those are not as-serted to truly exist, there is no way to say that these presenta-tions of the necessity for positing them as these are not feasi-ble. Consequently, there is no point in asserting them to truly exist. Even those who assert that [the noumenon, cessations, and so forth] truly exist must indeed assert and do indeed assert—with respect to those—presentations of definiendum and"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   335   definition, separative cause and separative effect, comprehen-sion by such-and-such valid cognition, and so forth. Then, if [it is claimed that the noumenon, cessations, and so forth] are not related with one’s object of attainment, definition, means of comprehension, and so forth, it could not be refuted that all unrelated [phenomena] would be [in the relationship of ] defi-nition and definiendum, and so forth. If a relation is asserted, then since dependence on another is not suitable in what truly exists, that is to say, is inherently established, a relationship cannot be posited [since it is being claimed that the noumenon, cessations, and so forth truly exist]. Positing the ultimate as truly existent undermines the assertion that other phenomena do not truly exist (see Insight, 97): Similarly, [the inherent existence of an uncompounded phe-nomenon] should also be refuted through analyzing whether [it and its basis of imputation] are one or different. If the assertion of these as truly existent could not be refuted by this reasoned analysis, then since it would also be the same in all respects with regard to compounded phenomena, true existence could not even in the least be refuted. As we saw earlier (301), Dol-po-pa holds that the ultimate is not a de-pendent-arising and thus there is no way that dependent-arising could be used to prove that the ultimate does not truly exist. Tsong-kha-pa, however, sees just the opposite (see Insight, 95): Thinking that when in this way compounded things—persons and other phenomena—have been established as not truly exis-tent by way of the reasonings described earlier, it can be estab-lished with little difficulty that uncompounded phenomena such as space, analytical cessations, non-analytical cessations, thusness, and so forth are not truly existent, Nāgārjuna says in the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle, Called “Wisdom”: Since compounded phenomena are thoroughly not es-tablished, How could the uncompounded be established? Whereas for Dol-po-pa dependent-arising necessarily means arising in dependence on causes and conditions, Tsong-kha-pa posits two types of dependent-arising (1) from the viewpoint of reliance on causes and conditions and (2) from the viewpoint of reliance of the object’s own"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"336   Comparison   parts (see Insight, 91): Therefore, external things such as sprouts and internal things such as compositional activity arise in dependence, respec-tively, on seeds and so forth, and on ignorance and so forth. This being so, that those [sprouts, compositional activity, and so forth] are established by way of their own character is not feasible because whatever is established by way of its own na-ture must be inherently established—that is, be able to set itself up under its own power—due to which it is contradictory for it to rely on causes and conditions. Āryadeva’s Four Hundred says: That which has a dependent arising Is not under its own power. All these are not under their own power; Therefore, self [inherent existence] does not exist. Through this you should understand that persons, pots, and so forth also are without inherent establishment because of being imputed in dependence on their own collection [of parts]. Those are two presentations of the reasoning of dependent-arising.a Jam-yang-shay-pa’s Great Exposition of Tenets shows that samutpāda does not just mean arising in the sense of being produced but also includes “existing” and “being established”:b Hence, pratītyasamutpāda means the dependent-arising of products—their arising in reliance on their own causes and conditions. It also means the dependent-arising [of all phenomena, products and non-products]—their existence meeting to or in reliance on their own parts, their own bases of imputation, or their own components because: • with regard to the Sanskrit original of “arising” (samut-pāda), Vasubandhu’s Commentary on the “Sūtra on Dependent-Arising” explains sam as “coming together,” “aggregating,” and so forth, and • Rājaputra Yashomitra explains pāda as “existing” and so forth.               a The two are (1) arising in dependence upon causes and conditions and (2) being im-puted in dependence on their own collection of parts. b Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness, 673-674, and Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 863."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   337   Also, because all phenomena are just established in dependence upon, in reliance upon, or meeting to [causes and conditions, their parts, and their basis of imputation], they are not self-instituting and do not exist through their own power. From Tsong-kha-pa’s viewpoint, Dol-po-pa’s limitation of dependent-arising to what is arisen from causes and conditions reflects non-comprehension of the basic Middle Way tenet of the compatibility of dependent-arising and emptiness and has not risen above the explana-tion of dependent-arising in the Great Exposition School, Sūtra School, and Mind-Only School. However, it is not that Dol-po-pa is without sources for his asser-tion that the ultimate truly exists, and thus Tsong-kha-pa must explain away quotes from Nāgārjuna that Dol-po-pa uses to buttress his argu-ment. Specifically, Dol-po-pa takes the statement in Nāgārjuna’s Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning that “only nirvāṇa is a truth” (above, 305) and statements in Nāgārjuna’s Praise of the Element of Attributes as support-ing his notion that the mode of subsistence ultimately or truly exists. Tsong-kha-pa accurately re-states Dol-po-pa’s argument but re-frames Nāgārjuna’s statements so that they support the opposite opinion (see Insight, 98): Objection: If the meaning of the statement [in Nāgārjuna’s Treatise on the Middle]: Since compounded phenomena are thoroughly not es-tablished, How could the uncompounded be established? is as you have explained above (96), does it not contradict (1) the statement in his Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning that only nirvāṇa is true and that the others are not: When the Conqueror said That only nirvāṇa is a truth, What wise person would think, “The rest are not unreal”? and (2) the statement also in his Praise of the Element of Attributes that the sūtras teaching emptiness—the absence of inherent ex-istence—are for the sake of abandoning the afflictive emotions and do not teach the non-existence of the naturally pure basic constituent: All the sūtras teaching emptiness"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"338   Comparison   Set forth by the Conqueror Overcome the afflictive emotions. [These sūtras] do not diminish this basic constituent. Answer: Those [who say such] are wrongly perspected with respect to the meaning of the scriptures as follows. The mean-ing of the former scripture is expressed [in sūtra]: The Supramundane Victor said, “Monastics, this ulti-mate truth is one—non-deceptive nirvāṇa. All composi-tional things have the attribute of falsity, deceptive-ness.” This sūtra passage also says that nirvāṇa is a truth and all com-positional things are false. The early part of the passage very clearly explains that truth means non-deceptive, and the latter part very clearly explains that falsity means deceptive. Fur-thermore, nirvāṇa [here refers] to ultimate truth [that is to say, the natural nirvāṇa, which is the emptiness of inherent exis-tence, and not the nirvāṇa that is the cessation of obstructions attained through practice of the path], as is explained in Chandrakīrti’s Commentary on (Nāgārjuna’s) “Sixty Stanzas of Rea-soning.”...Moreover, Nāgārjuna’s Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning says: These two, cyclic existence and nirvāṇa, Do not [inherently] exist. The thorough knowledge itself of cyclic existence Is called “nirvāṇa.” He explains that both cyclic existence and nirvāṇa are not in-herently existent and that [the emptiness which is] just the ob-ject of the knowledge that cyclic existence is not inherently es-tablished is posited as nirvāṇa. Therefore, how could this be a position asserting that the emptiness that is the absence of true existence of cyclic existence is an annihilatory emptiness! Moreover, the passage from Nāgārjuna’s Praise of the Element of Attributes (above, 99) means: For the sake of overcoming the apprehension of things as truly existent—the root of all other afflictive emo-tions—the sūtras teaching emptiness, the absence of inherent establishment, teach that the conceived object of the apprehension of true existence does not exist. They do not teach that emptiness—the naturally pure"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   339   basic constituent, the negative of the two selves that are the objects of the apprehension of true existence—does not exist. Since although this emptiness exists, it is not truly established, that passage serves as a source refuting the proposition that the emptiness that is a negative of true existence—its object of negation—does not exist. It also refutes the proposition that it is not necessary to realize emptiness, the ultimate suchness, in order exhaustively to abandon the afflictive emotions. Hence, Nāgārjuna’s Praise of the Element of Attributes itself says: Through the three called impermanence, [coarse] emp-tiness, And suffering, the mind is purified. The doctrine supremely purifying the mind Is naturelessness [that is, the absence of inherent exis-tence]. and: The naturelessness of phenomena Should be meditated upon as the element of attributes. He says that the absence of an inherently established nature in these phenomena is the element of attributes that is the object of meditation, and he says that just meditation on it is the su-preme purifier of the mind. Therefore, how could it be suitable to cite this [Praise of the Element of Attributes] for the position that the emptiness that is the absence of inherent establish-ment of phenomena appearing in this way is an annihilatory emptiness and that, therefore, a truly existent emptiness sepa-rate from it is to be posited as the emptiness that is the object of meditation! This is like propounding that in order to remove the suffer-ing of fright upon apprehending a snake in the east despite there being none there, the demonstration that there is no snake in the east will not serve as an antidote to it, but rather one should indicate, “There is a tree in the west.” For, one is propounding that in order to remove the suffering upon adher-ing to the true existence of what appears in this way to sentient beings, realization that those bases [that is, objects]—which are apprehended to truly exist—do not truly exist will not serve as an antidote, but that rather one must indicate that some other"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"340   Comparison   senseless base truly exists. From this viewpoint Tsong-kha-pa repeatedly criticizes Dol-po-pa for turning to a truly existent ultimate as the principal object of medita-tion. Tsong-kha-pa emphasizes that because suffering is caused by mis-apprehending the nature of persons and phenomena, reflective and meditative attention must be paid to the absence of such a status. Oth-erwise, it is impossible to overcome the afflictive emotions driving the very process of cyclic existence. The fundamental principle is that because beings misapprehend the status of phenomena, they must concentrate on understanding the lack of such a status in order to overcome the tendency to this basic error and all the ills built on it. Otherwise, meditation would be unre-lated to the problem sought to be overcome (see Insight, 57): ...it is like searching for a robber on the plain after the robber has gone to the woods. and in the context of the Mind-Only School:a ...since ordinary sentient beings conceive just these other-powered internal and external things—eyes, forms, and so forth which are objects seen, heard, and so forth—as self [that is, as objects and subjects that are different entities or as established by way of their own character as the referents of conceptual consciousnesses and of words], emptiness must be delineated within taking just these as the bases of emptiness. The error does not come through holding that the other two natures [that is, other-powered natures and imputational natures] exist as other factualities in the thoroughly established nature. Therefore, how could selflessness be delineated within thinking [as the Jo-nang-pas do] that the thoroughly established nature is empty because of existing as factually other than the other two natures! ...Therefore, Sthiramati’s Explanation of (Vasubandhu’s) Commentary on (Maitreya’s) “Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes” also says that it is not like a temple’s being empty of monastics and so forth but like a rope’s being empty of a snake...

If this is done, it will serve as an antidote to the apprehension of self. If, on the other hand, one meditates on an emptiness the mode of which is other than this style, it will not harm the apprehen-sion of self at all. Tsong-kha-pa makes the cogent case that innate misapprehension of the self of phenomena must be countered by taking those same phe-nomena—which are misperceived so as to lead beings into suffering and finitude—and by seeing that they do not have the falsely superim-posed quality of the imputational nature. He indicts Dol-po-pa for put-ting forth a system that is inadequate to the task of opposing the basic ignorance drawing beings into suffering and finitude:a With respect to that, when the thoroughly established nature that is the self lessness of phenomena is delineated in either the Yogic Practice School or the Middle Way School, the bases of emptiness with respect to which [the thoroughly established nature] is delineated are relative to those bases with respect to which a self of phenomena is apprehended by a consciousness apprehending a self of phenomena. It is like, for example, the fact that if you wish to remove the suffering of fright from someone upon that person’s apprehending a rope as a snake, you must show—upon taking the rope as the basis of empti-ness—that it is empty of a snake. However, it is not suitable to take the rope’s emptiness of a snake as the basis of emptiness and say that it is empty [of being a rope and a snake] because of existing as factually other [than them]. Furthermore, with respect to the apprehension of a self of phenomena, such apprehensions as that directionally partless minute particles exist and that objects of apprehension com-posed of them exist or that a moment of consciousness that has no earlier and later temporal parts exists or that a conscious-ness that is a continuum composed of those exists—these being imputed only by those whose awarenesses have been affected by [mistaken] tenets—occur only among those proponents of tenets and do not exist among other sentient beings. Therefore, though an emptiness that is no more than merely an absence of those [objects of negation] is taught, it does not at all harm the               a Hopkins, Emptiness in the Mind-Only School of Buddhism, 226-227."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"342   Comparison   innate apprehension of self that has resided [in the mental con-tinuum] beginninglessly.

Despite their difference about the relationship of the two truths, Dol-po-pa and Tsong-kha-pa agree that the ultimate is an object of knowl-edge and a wing of a dichotomy: whatever exists must be either an ul-timate truth or an obscurational truth. Dol-po-pa (above, 304) holds that the ultimate—since it is an object of pristine wisdom—is an object of knowledge and that the two truths are different, and Tsong-kha-pa similarly says (see Illumination, 224): The reasoning [why there are only two truths] is that if a cer-tain base [that is, an object] is—on the positive side—distinguished as a falsity, a deceptive object, then on the exclu-sionary side it must be eliminated that it is a non-deceptive suchness, due to which the deceptive and the non-deceptive are dichotomous explicit contradictories. Since whatever is [a dichotomous pair] covers all objects of knowledge, a further category that is both and a further category that is neither are eliminated. It is as Kamalashīla’s Illumination of the Middle says: Phenomena that have the character of being a dichot-omy are such that if something is refuted to be the one and it is not established to be the other, then it does not exist. Therefore, it also is not reasonable to think of it as in a class that is neither of those two. and: Two that are such that something does not exist if it is neither [of them] have the character of being a dichot-omy.

Examples are, for instance, particular [pairs] such as the physical and the non-physical, and so forth. This is also to be understood with respect to all other explicit contradictories [that is, dichotomies].

The Mid-dle Way Autonomy School and the Middle Way Consequence School do not differ with respect to [asserting] that [within ex-istents] if something is eliminated as being one side of a dichot-omy, it must be established as the other and that if one is re-futed, the other is established. Still, as we saw above (304) Dol-po-pa does not hold that the ultimate is a wing of a dichotomy between existing as an effective thing and not existing as an effective thing, since it is neither, and thus is “a third category and the center or middle.” Tsong-kha-pa, on the other hand, holds that the ultimate is a non-effective thing; he does not opt for a third category here. A pristine wisdom is not an ultimate To establish that a pristine wisdom is not an ultimate, as opposed to Dol-po-pa’s fundamental assertion (above, 306) that self-arisen pristine wisdom is an ultimate truth and a thoroughly established nature, Tsong-kha-pa distinguishes between many different usages of the term “ultimate” in the literature of the Middle Way School (see Insight, 141): Though indeed the object, the noumenon, is to be taken as the ultimate, there are also many descriptions of the subject—the rational consciousness—as an ultimate, as is set forth in: • Jñānagarbha’s Differentiation of the Two Truths: Because of being undeceiving, a rational [conscious-ness] is an ultimate. • and moreover in Kamalashīla’s Illumination of the Middle: The statements also that production and so forth do not ultimately exist are asserted to mean the follow-ing: All consciousnesses arisen from correct hearing, thinking, and meditating are non-erroneous subjects; hence, they are called “ultimates” because of being the ultimate among these [consciousnesses."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"346   Comparison   Production and so forth do not exist for such con-sciousnesses and in this sense do not exist ultimately.] There are two types of rational consciousnesses: 1. non-conceptual: a Superior’s non-conceptual pristine wis-dom of meditative equipoise 2. conceptual: a rational consciousness comprehending such-ness in dependence on a reason, and so forth. The thought of Bhāvaviveka’s Blaze of Reasoning in describing the ultimate as twofold—a non-conceptual pristine wisdom and a wisdom concordant with that—and the thought of Ka-malashīla’s Illumination of the Middle in describing two ultimates are the same. Therefore, it is not the meaning of those texts that the explanation of two ultimates should be taken as ulti-mates only in terms of objects and not in terms of subjects. Concerning this, when the first [that is, a Superior’s non-conceptual pristine wisdom of non-conceptual meditative equipoise] understands suchness, it is able simultaneously to eliminate with respect to its object the proliferations of [the apprehension of ] true [existence] and the proliferations of du-alistic appearance; hence, [a Superior’s non-conceptual pristine wisdom of non-conceptual meditative equipoise] is an actual ultimate; also, that is the meaning of being “beyond all prolif-erations” (in the quote above on 139). Although the second [that is, a conceptual rational consciousness comprehending suchness in dependence on a sign, and so forth] is able to cease the proliferations [of the apprehension] of true [existence] with respect to its own object [that is, emptiness], it cannot elimi-nate the proliferations of dualistic appearance; hence, it is an ultimate that accords in aspect with the supramundane ulti-mate. It is necessary to set forth two modes also with respect to the object-ultimatea that is the negative of ultimately [existent] production—and so forth—of forms and so on. Concerning this: • In the perspective of a non-conceptual rational conscious-ness, the object-emptiness is the actual ultimate free from both proliferations. • In the perspective of a conceptual rational consciousness,               a yul gyi don dam; 483.6.

However, this is not to say that in general it is not an actual ultimate truth. Therefore, except for the case of being free from all prolifera-tions of dualistic appearance in the perspective of certain awarenesses, an emptiness of true existence free from all pro-liferations of appearance does not occur, and hence the mean-ing of those texts is not that whatever is an ultimate truth is necessarily free from all proliferations of dualistic appearance. Nga-wang-pel-den’s Annotations for (Jam-yang-shay-pa’s) “Great Exposition of Tenets”a draws out the meaning of this passage within emphasizing that the distinction of actual and concordant emptinesses is made rela-tive to the perspectives of different types of realizational conscious-nesses and that emptiness itself, whether realized by a conceptual con-sciousness or a non-conceptual consciousness, is always the actual ul-timate: This says that a Superior’s uncontaminated pristine wisdom is an actual subject-ultimate, not that it is an actual ultimate. In general, an ultimate truth is an actual ultimate free from both proliferations in the perspective of a non-conceptual rational consciousness and is the ultimate free from only one class of proliferations in the perspective of a conceptual rational con-sciousness. It is utterly not the case that the emptiness that is the object comprehended by a non-conceptual rational con-sciousness is the ultimate free from both proliferations and that the emptiness that is the object comprehended by a con-ceptual rational consciousness is the ultimate free from only one class of proliferations because both an ultimate free from both proliferations and an ultimate free from only one class of proliferations do not occur [that is, they are impossible], since whatever is an ultimate truth necessarily is involved with pro-liferations. For elucidation of the last clause—“whatever is an ultimate truth nec-essarily is involved with proliferations”—Nga-wang-pel-den refers readers to his Explanation of the Obscurational and the Ultimate in the Four Systemsb where he emphasizes that the frequent description of the               a dngos, la, 188.4. b 194.2, 195.1, 199.1."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"348   Comparison   ultimate as free from the proliferations of conceptuality is in terms of certain consciousnesses, for if the ultimate were free from prolifera-tions in general, it could not be either existent or non-existent or either one or different.a These distinctions, beyond trying to have fun with Dol-po-pa’s and others’ emphasis on reality as free from conceptual proliferations, ex-plain away the many descriptions of wisdom as the ultimate by con-signing such a designation to the realm of the metaphoric, since, ac-cording to this explanation, the only actual ultimate is emptiness even if in direct realization of emptiness there is not the least recognition of difference between the wisdom consciousness and emptiness. Whereas Dol-po-pa’s system and many others start from equating pristine wis-dom and emptiness, Tsong-kha-pa starts from their difference, despite his own description of the state of non-conceptual realization as undif-ferentiated. A Buddha’s omniscient wisdom perceives the conventional explicitly, not implicitly For Tsong-kha-pa an omniscient mind must know all phenomena, in-cluding the ordinary (see Insight, 135): If a Buddha did not perceive the aggregates and so forth, it would deprecate the exalted knowledge of the diversity and all the diverse objects because the existent and what is not known by a Buddha are mutually exclusive. Dol-po-pa (above, 275) similarly holds that an omniscient mind must know all phenomena, but he makes the distinction that it only implic-itly knows ordinary phenomena, which, therefore, do not appear to it. Tsong-kha-pa, to the contrary, asserts that an omniscient mind must explicitly know all phenomena, which, therefore, must appear to it. He continues: Consequently, the diverse objects must appear to an exalted knower of the diversity [of phenomena]. Since exalted knowl-edge without the aspect [of the object appearing] is not this [Consequentialist] system, [objects are known by an omniscient consciousness] upon the appearance of their aspect.               a This is the type of initially mind-boggling but eventually cogent, in-your-face distinc-tion that Tibetan (not just Ge-luk-pa) scholars love to make: there is non-conceptual realization of emptiness, but this does not necessitate that emptiness itself has to be free from the proliferations of conceptuality."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   349   To establish that an omniscient mind explicitly knows all phenomena, including the ordinary, and yet does not itself become mistaken, Tsong-kha-pa distinguishes between what an omniscient mind knows from its own perspective and what it knows from others’ perspectives: With respect to the mode of appearance, when the marks and beauties of a Buddha appear to persons who have not aban-doned ignorance, their appearance as established by way of their own character—despite not being so established—is not by reason of those objects’ having arisen through the force of the latencies of ignorance but is an appearance due to the [per-ceiving] subject’s being polluted by the latencies of ignorance. For those [marks and beauties of a Buddha] do not appear to that subject [that is, a Buddha’s consciousness] from the view-point of merely appearing thusa to other persons but appear thus from [a Buddha’s] own viewpoint. The appearance of objects such as forms and soundsb—which appear in the perspective of those who have not aban-doned ignorance as established by way of their own character whereas they are not so established—to a Buddha’s pristine wisdom knowing the diversity is an appearance to a Buddha only from the viewpoint of [these phenomena] appearing to persons who have the pollutions of ignorance. Without depend-ing on their appearing thus to others, they do not appear from a Buddha’s own viewpoint. Therefore, a Buddha’s knowing forms and so forth—which appear to be inherently established whereas they are not so established—is also from the viewpoint of their appearing thus to those who possess ignorance. With-out depending on the appearance of them to those persons, Buddhas from their own viewpoint do not know them in the manner of their appearing this way; hence, there is no sense in which [a Buddha’s consciousness] could become mistaken through their appearing. This is because, although they do not appear within the context of the pristine wisdom’s having pol-lution, they appear by way of the essential that the pristine               a That is, as the marks and beauties of a Buddha. b The false appearance of objects such as forms and sounds as if they inherently exist is itself something that exists, and thus it must be known by an omniscient Buddha and hence must appear to a Buddha. However, this appearance occurs to a Buddha not be-cause of a fault in that Buddha, but only because it occurs this way for beings who have the pollutions of ignorance. From a Buddha’s own viewpoint, only endless purity is perceived."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"350   Comparison   wisdom must know all objects of knowledge. From the viewpoint of an exalted knower of the diversity itself, all things appear in the perspective of selflessness and the absence of inherent existence, whereby they appear as fal-sities, like illusions; they do not appear as truths. When [phe-nomena] appear to that pristine wisdom from the factor of ap-pearing to those who have ignorance, this is a mere becoming visible of the appearance [of those] as true to other persons. To maintain that a Buddha actually perceives all phenomena, Dol-po-pa holds that Buddhas know obscurational truths only implicitly in the sense that by explicitly knowing the truth they know that these other phenomena do not exist. Tsong-kha-pa, to uphold a Buddha’s omnis-cience, makes an entirely different distinction that allows for explicit realization of everything. As a reason why conventional phenomena do not appear to a Bud-dha, Dol-po-pa cites several sources clearly indicating that Buddhas are always in meditative equipoise (above, 278). Tsong-kha-pa counters that an omniscient mind has two types of knowledge simultaneously. First he gives sources for his own position and then explains away Dol-po-pa’s sources as referring only to a Buddha’s knowledge of suchness (see Insight, 137): In that way Jñānagarbha’s Differentiation of the Two Truths ex-plains that [this pristine wisdom] vividly perceives directly all the diversity: An omniscient knower directly perceives All the dependently produced Just as they appear Devoid of the superimposed entity. and he explains that [Buddhas] never rise from the meditative stabilization in which dualistic appearance has been pacified: Because that which does not see knowers, Objects known, and selfhood has a stable abiding Due to the non-arising of signs, [Buddhas] do not rise [from meditative stabilization]. Although to those who do not properly understand those two explanations it seems to be contradictory to assert both—rather than just one of the two—there is no contradiction. This is because although the two pristine wisdoms perceiving"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   351   suchness and perceiving the diversity are one entity, there is not the slightest contradiction that in relation to individual ob-jects [that is, the ultimate and the conventional] there come to be two—a rational consciousness and a conventional con-sciousness. Tsong-kha-pa makes the distinction that the two types of a Buddha’s pristine wisdom—dualistically knowing the diversity of phenomena and knowing suchness non-dualistically—are determined relative to particular objects. In this way, each of the two types of pristine wisdom realizes both the diversity and suchness, but in relation to those objects they are called knowing the diversity and knowing suchness. Tsong-kha-pa stresses that all phenomena must appear to a Buddha (see Illumination, 257): There are two ways that a Buddha’s pristine wisdom knows ob-jects of knowledge—a mode of knowing all objects of knowl-edge that are ultimate truths and a mode of knowing all objects of knowledge that are obscurational truths. Concerning those, the first is knowledge of the suchness of the aggregates and so forth in the manner of not perceiving their conventional ap-pearances. The second is knowledge [of those aggregates and so forth] in the perspective of the pristine wisdom knowing the diversity [of phenomena] in the manner of dualistic appearance as object and subject; this is because it is not suitable to posit that a Buddha has implicit realization in which something is realized even though it does not appear and hence [everything] must be known upon its appearing.a Although with respect to a Buddha’s knowledge of the di-versity the aggregates and so forth do not appear upon its be-ing polluted by the predispositions of ignorance, what appears to the consciousnesses of other persons that are polluted with ignorance must appear to a Buddha. This is because it is not suitable for those appearances to be non-existent, and if a con-ventionality exists, it must be observed by [a Buddha’s] knowl-edge of the diversity. Although the falling hairs that appear to one with cataracts do not appear to the eye consciousness of one free from cataracts, those appearances do not need to be non-existent; therefore, they are unlike [the situation with] a Buddha [wherein if a conventionality exists, it must appear to a               a This counters Dol-po-pa’s notion that a Buddha only implicitly knows obscurational truths; see above, 275ff."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"352   Comparison   Buddha, and if something does not appear to a Buddha, it must not exist]. He goes on to accept at face value the quote (or one similar to it) that Dol-po-pa (above, 277) had to explain away: Just as the sun’s emitting one ray Illuminates transmigrating beings, A conqueror’s pristine wisdom simultaneously Shines to all objects of knowledge. Tsong-kha-pa takes the passage literally: Until the predispositions for mistaken dualistic appearance have been extinguished, the two direct comprehensions (1) of the mode of being [of phenomena] and (2) of the diversity [of phenomena] cannot be generated in one entity, due to which these must be comprehended within an alternation between meditative equipoise and states subsequent to meditative equi-poise, and, therefore, comprehension of these two does not come within a single instant of pristine wisdom. When the pre-dispositions for mistakenness have been completely aban-doned, the generation of the two pristine wisdoms within each instant of pristine wisdom is continuous; hence, alternation be-tween directly comprehending and not comprehending the two types of objects of knowledge at one time is not necessary. For this reason, [our presentation] also does not contradict the statement: A single instant of exalted knowledge Pervades the full circle of objects of knowledge. That although the two pristine wisdoms are one entity, there is not even the slightest contradiction in there coming to be two different modes of knowledge in relation to two [types of ] objects is an attribute solely of a Buddha, a Supramundane Victor. Whereas that is the case, those who take only the mode of knowledge of suchness as the mode of a Buddha’s mode of knowledge and thereupon say that knowledge of the diversity [of phenomena] does not exist in a Buddha’s mental continuum but instead is included within the continuums of trainees are deprecating a Buddha’s knowledge of the diversity. Dol-po-pa’s opinion, as documented earlier (275), is that a Buddha ex-plicitly knows only the mode of being, including all ultimate qualities"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"   Tsong-kha-pa’s   Rebuttal   353   subsisting in it, but only implicitly knows the diversity of ordinary phe-nomena through knowing them to be non-existent. Tsong-kha-pa explains away Dol-po-pa’s evidence for his position in sūtra passages saying that the non-seeing of phenomena is seeing the noumenon (see Insight, 130): “They see it in the manner of non-seeing” does not refer to not seeing any and all objects but indicates that if these that are observed through the power of the cataracts of ignorance ex-isted as [their own] suchness, they would have to be observed by the pristine wisdom of uncontaminated meditative equi-poise of Superiors, whereas they are not, and thus their seeing suchness is by way of not seeing any of those. For due to not observing the object of negation—despite the fact that if it did exist, it would be suitable to be observed—it is posited that the negative of the object of negation is realized [and hence empti-ness is seen and it is not that nothing at all is seen]. The mean-ing of “Non-seeing is the excellent seeing” (see Illumination, 259) is to be understood similarly. Moreover, in that way the Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom (see also Illumination, 260) says: The One-Gone-Thus teaches that one who does not see forms, Does not see feelings, does not see discriminations, Does not see intentions, does not see Consciousness, mind, or sentience sees the dharma.a Analyze how space is seen as in the expression By sentient beings in words, “Space is seen.” The One-Gone-Thus teaches that seeing the dharma is also like that. The seeing cannot be expressed by another example. This says that the unseen is the aggregates, and the seen is the dharma, which means suchness, as in the statement, “Whoever sees dependent-arising sees the dharma.” Furthermore, it is like, for example, the fact that space is a mere elimination of obstructive objects of touch, and that see-ing—or realizing—it is taken as not seeing the preventive obstruction that is the object of negation and is suitable to be               a chos, which here means chos nyid (dharmatā), as Tsong-kha-pa says just below when he equates it with suchness."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"354   Comparison   observed if it were present. In that [example], the seen is space, and the unseen is preventive obstruction. The last two lines re-fute that suchness is seen while seeing blue [for instance], which would be not to see in accordance with the example [of seeing space]. The statement that the five aggregates are not seen indicates that the substrata [that is, these phenomena,] are not seen in the perspective of perception of suchness by uncontaminated meditative equipoise. In this way, Tsong-kha-pa limits the scope of the many statements that conventional phenomena do not appear to the pristine wisdom non-dualistically realizing suchness (see Illumination, 262): All those [statements] are sources for the non-appearance of conventionalities, such as the aggregates, in the perspective of directly perceiving suchness. Therefore, none of the proliferations of dualistic phenom-ena such as effective thing, non-effective thing, and so forth occur in the perspective of directly perceiving suchness be-cause the entities of those proliferations are not observed in that [perspective]."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" 355 3. Summary Twenty-four major points highlight Dol-po-pa’s and Tsong-kha-pa’s systems. 1. Dol-po-pa: Self-emptiness is empty emptiness in that compounded phenomena are empty of themselves. Tsong-kha-pa: Self-emptiness is empty emptiness in that both com-pounded and uncompounded phenomena are empty of inherent exis-tence, but they are not empty of themselves. 2. Dol-po-pa: Other-emptiness is non-empty emptiness in that the ultimate is the basis of emptiness, which is empty of the other, that is to say, conventionalities, and is not empty of itself. Tsong-kha-pa: It can be said that the ultimate is other-empty in that the ultimate is not the conventional, but it is empty of inherent existence, and thus the ultimate is a self-emptiness and thus an empty emptiness. 3. Dol-po-pa: Self-emptiness is not the ultimate. Tsong-kha-pa: Self-emptiness is the ultimate. 4. Dol-po-pa: The ultimate is able to bear analysis. Tsong-kha-pa: Even the ultimate is not able to bear analysis. 5. Dol-po-pa: The middle wheel of doctrine teaches that the ultimate is self-empty only out of a purposeful intent and thus requires interpre-tation. Tsong-kha-pa: The teaching in the middle wheel of doctrine that the ultimate is self-empty is literally acceptable because the ultimate also is empty of inherent existence. 6. Dol-po-pa: Realizing and accustoming to self-emptiness just tempo-rarily suppresses or reduces the pointedness of only coarse afflictive emotions. Tsong-kha-pa: Realizing and accustoming to self-emptiness totally removes all coarse and subtle afflictive emotions."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"356   Comparison   7. Dol-po-pa: The third wheel of doctrine is definitive because it clearly teaches that the ultimate ultimately exists but conventionalities do not ultimately exist. Tsong-kha-pa: The third wheel requires interpretation because it teaches that all phenomena, ultimate and conventional, are established by way of their own character. 8. Dol-po-pa: The ultimate exists and is an object of knowledge. Tsong-kha-pa: Agreed. 9. Dol-po-pa: The ultimate is not a dependent-arising, since depend-ent-arisings are necessarily impermanent and deceptive. Tsong-kha-pa: Even the ultimate is a dependent-arising, since de-pendent-arising means (1) arising in dependence on causes and condi-tions, (2) existing in dependence on parts, and (3) existing in depend-ence on a basis of imputation and in dependence upon conceptuality that imputes it, due to which even the permanent are dependent-arisings. 10. Dol-po-pa: The two truths, obscurational and ultimate, are neither one nor one entity since they are different, though not different enti-ties. Their difference simply means that they are not the same entity. Hence, an ultimate truth is not an obscurational truth, and an obscura-tional truth is not an ultimate truth. Tsong-kha-pa: The two truths are not one but are one entity. They are different isolates but not different entities. Hence, an ultimate truth is not an obscurational truth, and an obscurational truth is not an ulti-mate truth. 11. Dol-po-pa: Whatever exists is either an ultimate truth or an obscu-rational truth. Tsong-kha-pa: Agreed. 12. Dol-po-pa: Although there is no third category between ultimate truth and obscurational truth since whatever exists must be either an ultimate truth or an obscurational truth, there is a third category be-tween existing as an effective thing and not existing as an effective thing."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"    Summary    357    Tsong-kha-pa: There is no third category between existing as an effective thing and not existing as an effective thing. The ultimate is the latter. 13. Dol-po-pa: The ultimate is true ultimately, and obscurational truths are true conventionally. Tsong-kha-pa: The ultimate truth could not ultimately exist with-out contradicting that it is the absence of inherent existence of all phe-nomena. 14. Dol-po-pa: “Ultimately existent” means “existing as able to bear analysis by a rational consciousness,” and ultimate truth is able to bear analysis by a rational consciousness and is, therefore, ultimately exis-tent. Tsong-kha-pa: “Ultimately existent” means “existing from its own side,” a consequence of which is that any object that ultimately exists must be able to bear analysis by a rational consciousness, and nothing can bear such analysis. 15. Dol-po-pa: If the ultimate were self-empty, it would be empty of itself and thus would not exist at all. Tsong-kha-pa: The object of negation of self-emptiness is not the object that is the substratum of self-emptiness but its inherent exis-tence, due to which even though the ultimate is self-empty, it exists. 16. Dol-po-pa: The ultimate is an affirming negative, not a non-affirming negative. Tsong-kha-pa: The ultimate is non-affirming negative, not an af-firming negative. 17. Dol-po-pa: Conventionalities do not exist in the mode of subsis-tence, but the ultimate (including ultimate Buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind) exist in the mode of subsistence. Tsong-kha-pa: Nothing exists in the mode of subsistence in that nothing exists as its own mode of subsistence, since then it would in-herently exist. Thus, the mode of subsistence, that is, emptiness, is not its own mode of subsistence, but the mode of subsistence exists, and the mode of subsistence is the mode of subsistence."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"358   Comparison   18. Dol-po-pa: Karmic appearances of sentient beings exist in the per-spective of mistaken consciousness and do not exist in the perspective of pristine wisdom. Nothing is both a valid cognition and a mistaken consciousness. Tsong-kha-pa: Karmic appearances of sentient beings exist in the perspective of valid cognitions that are mistaken consciousness only in the sense that their objects appear to inherently exist whereas they do not. They also are directly perceived by a pristine wisdom knowing the diversity of phenomena. 19. Dol-po-pa: Pristine wisdom and the ultimate are equivalent. Tsong-kha-pa: Pristine wisdom and the ultimate are mutually ex-clusive, even though there is no sensing of their difference in direct realization of the ultimate. 20. Dol-po-pa: The matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus, endowed with ultimate Buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind, is the basic reality and pristine wisdom. Tsong-kha-pa: The matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus is not endowed with ultimate Buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind; the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus is the emptiness of inherent existence of a defiled mind and thus is not endowed with Buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind, which are generated through observing and meditating on emp-tiness. 21. Dol-po-pa: The Great Middle Way is presented in texts by Great Ve-hicle masters such as Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, Āryadeva, Buddhapālita, Bhā-vaviveka, Vasubandhu, and so forth up to but not always including Chandrakīrti, who is self-contradictory in both refuting and propound-ing a matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus endowed with ultimate Buddha quali-ties. Tsong-kha-pa: The Great Middle Way is the view of the Conse-quence School itself, as presented by Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Buddha-pālita, Chandrakīrti, and Shāntideva. 22. Dol-po-pa: Pristine wisdom is simply permanent and not in the sense that its continuum goes on forever. Tsong-kha-pa: Pristine wisdom even at the stage of Buddhahood is"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"    Summary    359    impermanent, though at Buddhahood its continuum goes on forever, and in this sense is called permanent. 23. Dol-po-pa: Buddhas are omniscient in that they know the phenom-ena of the desire, form, and formless realms implicitly. Through know-ing the ultimate explicitly, they know that the phenomena of the de-sire, form, and formless realms do not exist and thus implicitly know them. Tsong-kha-pa: Buddhas know both the ultimate and the conven-tional explicitly, that is, through the appearance of everything to their omniscient wisdom. They perceive only endless purity from their own perspective, but they explicitly and directly perceive other phenomena by way of these phenomena appearing to sentient beings. 24. Dol-po-pa: Buddhas are always in meditative equipoise directly re-alizing the ultimate. Tsong-kha-pa: Buddhas have a state of wisdom in which meditative equipoise directly realizing the ultimate and the state subsequent to meditative equipoise are fused in one mind without having to alternate between them. Five quintessential perspectives I see these marked differences as stemming from five basic perspec-tives: • Both Dol-po-pa and Tsong-kha-pa agree that there is totally non-dual non-conceptual realization of the ultimate, in which from the viewpoint of experience wisdom and emptiness are undifferenti-able. Dol-po-pa takes this to mean that reality and pristine wisdom are identical and bases his system on this identity, resulting in such tenets as holding that wisdom is permanent. Tsong-kha-pa, on the other hand, does not build his system stemming from this experi-ence, although it is one of its aims; rather, he conceptually sepa-rates wisdom and emptiness, allowing pristine wisdom to be im-permanent, though continuous at Buddhahood. • Both agree that ordinary phenomena do not appear to a wisdom of meditative equipoise realizing the ultimate, and both agree that such phenomena do not exist in the mode of subsistence or as their own mode of subsistence. From this viewpoint Dol-po-pa posits conventional phenomena as self-empty, that is, empty of"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"360   Comparison   themselves, whereas Tsong-kha-pa considers this an over-extension of the import of profound meditative equipoise. • Both agree that a yogi’s perspective is crucially important. Dol-po-pa makes this the center of his presentation of even ordinary phe-nomena, whereas Tsong-kha-pa argues that a yogi’s perspective wreaks havoc with a presentation of the world and centers his presentation of ordinary phenomena around ordinary perception, even though he relegates ordinary phenomena to a realm of coarse conventions. He considers a yogi’s perspective to be an exception, whereas for Dol-po-pa an experienced and highly developed yogi’s perspective is the norm. When their respective systems work well with certain trainees, Dol-po-pa’s presentation pulls his followers into the higher level, whereas Tsong-kha-pa’s presentation fits or-dinary perception and provides a way pushing his followers toward the higher state. (When their systems do not work well for certain practitioners, Dol-po-pa’s presentation seems too other-worldly, beyond reach, whereas Tsong-kha-pa’s seems too this-worldly. Both of these are cases of mistaking the intention of the respective systems.) • Both agree that conventional phenomena are posited by mistaken consciousness. Dol-po-pa holds that these consciousnesses are just mistaken, whereas Tsong-kha-pa posits that a consciousness mis-taken with respect to its appearing object can be valid with respect to its object of operation. Taken to their respective extreme, Dol-po-pa’s emphasis on the mistakenness of ordinary consciousness seems to leave no room for any sort of valid progression of thought, possibly resulting in a quandary of how to posit spiritual progress, whereas Tsong-kha-pa’s emphasis on the validity of a great deal of ordinary thought might seem to sanctify the ordinary outlook, leading to mistakenly undermining the need for spiritual progress. • Both agree that a Buddha is omniscient and explicitly knows the ultimate. Dol-po-pa holds that a Buddha knows ordinary phenom-ena only implicitly in that through explicitly knowing the ultimate a Buddha implicitly knows that ordinary phenomena do not exist. Tsong-kha-pa holds that a Buddha also knows ordinary phenomena explicitly, but relegates this knowledge to occurring by way of such phenomena appearing to sentient beings, not from the Buddha’s own perspective. Dol-po-pa’s opinion might seem to undercut his own claim that a Buddha brings about immeasurable benefit for sentient beings, whereas Tsong-kha-pa’s opinion might seem to de-value his own claims of the validity of most ordinary perceptions,"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"    Summary    361    since Buddhas do not perceive ordinary phenomena from their own perspective. • Both agree that spiritual progress is wrought through intense effort at merit and wisdom. One root difference It seems to me that the fundamental distinction is that Dol-po-pa holds that whatever is explicitly realized by pristine wisdom must be ulti-mately established,a whereas Tsong-kha-pa holds that although the ul-timate is realized by pristine wisdom, it is not ultimately established. Tsong-kha-pa is able to do this by making a distinction between being realized (or found) by a rational consciousness (rigs shes kyis rtogs sam rnyed pa) and being able to bear analysis by a rational consciousness (rigs shes kyis dpyad bzod du grub pa), whereas Dol-po-pa does not. They agree that if something is able to bear analysis by a rational conscious-ness, it must be ultimately existent, and thus Dol-po-pa asserts that the ultimate is ultimately existent, but Tsong-kha-pa does not. Dol-po-pa holds that the ultimate can bear analysis by the reason-ing of dependent-arising simply because the ultimate is not a depend-ent-arising, a category which he limits to the impermanent and con-ventional. Also, he holds that the ultimate can bear analysis by reason-ing into whether it is one or many because the ultimate is partless and thus one. By extending the scope of ultimate existence to whatever a Bud-dha’s pristine wisdom explicitly realizes, Dol-po-pa asserts that ulti-mate qualities of body, speech, and mind must also be ultimately estab-lished and permanent. This, in turn, requires that ordinary body, speech, and mind and so forth cannot appear to an omniscient mind, which then must know them only implicitly, for otherwise the ordinary would be ultimately established and permanent and hence not subject to removal. Correspondingly, once ultimate qualities of body, speech, and mind are permanent, they must pre-exist in the continuums of sentient beings, a position requiring that the matrix-of-One-Gone-Thus is endowed with ultimate qualities of body, speech, and mind and is not just the emptiness of the mind in the continuum of a defiled mind, as it is for Tsong-kha-pa.               a Tsong-kha-pa (Illumination, 123) accurately describes Dol-po-pa’s stance as “the proposition that if there is anything found by uncontaminated meditative equipoise, it is truly established.” See also Illumination, 194, and Nga-wang-pel-den’s summation of other scholars’ reactions to the same issue in the accompanying footnote, which is drawn from Hopkins, Maps of the Profound, 745, where there is more context."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"362   Comparison   For the latter, the ultimate is a dependent-arising and has parts, due to which it cannot bear analysis by a rational consciousness and hence is not ultimately established. Also, Tsong-kha-pa makes distinc-tions with regard to how an omniscient mind knows the ultimate and the conventional, such that the conventional can manifestly appear to an omniscient mind and all phenomena can be explicitly realized. Both systems are illustrations of the magnificent flowering of Bud-dhist thought in Tibet, where many savants presented overarching per-spectives incorporating not just a few texts but the entire range of ma-jor Indian expositions.

When one depends on [phenomena of ] the Desire Realm, one will accumulate [one of the nine] thorough enwrapments.c Fifth fault a. When one depends on [phenomena of ] the Desire Realm, there is not the least sinful non-virtue that one will not do.d The first fault has three categories. The first is that beings of the Desire Realm are of little import. Even if they achieve some virtue, it brings little profit. This is because the mental basis is a mind of the Desire Realm. Until one arrives at a high Bodhisattva ground, one cannot use a mind of the Desire Realm with great profit. The second category is that there are many sufferings. This means that no matter what conditions or circumstances one meets with, they mostly generate suffering. It is obvious that the feeling of pain is a case of suffering; feelings of pleasure and neutral feelings also induce suffer-ing. The third category means that there are many objects of observa-tion which generate faulty states—that is, there are many objects capa-ble of generating afflictive emotions, such as desire and hatred, in the perceiver. Usually, in texts, the word nyes dmigs,e which we often trans-late merely as “fault,” applies to the afflictive emotions themselves. Here, however, the object of observation is designated with the name of the afflictive emotion. Usually, nyes dmigs refers to the internal, but here it refers to external objects of observation that serve as causes for generating afflictive emotions. The second of the five faults related to the Desire Realm also has three categories. The first is that when one depends on phenomena of the Desire Realm—virtuous, non-virtuous, or neutral—one does not ex-perience auspiciousness. There is no discussion of the first category in either Indian or Tibetan commentaries; however, there are phrases in other books in dependence on which it can be understood. The word ngoms is interpreted to mean gya noms pa, “auspiciousness,”f although it usually means “satisfaction.” For instance, when one speaks of eating               a yang dag par song ba. b skyes bu dam pa rnams kyis rnam grangs du ma’i sgo nas smad pa. c ’dod pa rnams la brten pa na kun tu sbyor ba rnams nye bar gsog par ’gyur ba. d ’dod pa la brten pa na sdig pa mi dge ba mi bya ba cung zad kyang med pa. e ādīnava. f praṇīta."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":" Mode of Analysis of Grossness/Peacefulness 365 ordinary gross foods, one does not include the experiencing of the food of meditative stabilization, an experience of auspiciousness that is more elevated than just nourishing the body. Probably, the food of meditative stabilization is being contrasted to the gross food of the De-sire Realm. The second category is that when one depends on phenomena of the Desire Realm one does not know satisfaction. No matter what one gets in terms of place, food, clothing, and so forth, more attachment is generated; something further is desired. This second category is di-vided into two parts: itself—that is, not knowing satisfaction—and an-other, having great desire. This latter means that within knowing you cannot get something, you are impelled to keep thinking about getting it. This fact is used as a reason for stopping afflictive emotions—because there is no end to them. The occurrence of this condition serves as a proof that they will increase limitlessly. The third category is that with respect to Desire Realm phenomena there is no end that satisfies the heart. All three of these are basically similar; however, the afflictive emotions of sentient beings have many different forms. Even one afflictive emotion can occur in many differ-ent types. What is indicated here is that there would be no end which would fulfill the heart. I think there is probably a difference in strength among these three, the third being the worst. The first, that there is no auspiciousness in the Desire Realm, is general. The third, although much the same as the second, is a little stronger. The third of the five faults of the Desire Realm, that great beings have derided the Desire Realm on many counts, also has three catego-ries corresponding to three types of great beings who have done so. There are no clear Tibetan commentaries on this; thus, we cannot come to a very definite decision on these three categories. In the first category, the word dam pa, which we generally translate as “excellent,” can be posited in two ways, one in terms of good quali-ties and the other in terms of persons. For instance, Chandrakīrti’s Sup-plement to (Nāgārjuna’s) “Treatise on the Middle”a refers to engagement in the ten excellent paths of action, which are good qualities. Persons who have all ten of these excellent paths of action are known as excellent persons. Thus, the first of the three categories related to the third fault of the Desire Realm concerns these excellent ones. The second category, people who have become elevated, refers to people up to the point of being just about to attain a path.

Thus, this category is more elevated than the first one. The last category is an excellent being. This is almost the same as a valid person.b Such a person is one who, at the very least, has directly realized the four truths. Therefore, these excellent beings would be posited in terms of a Superior path, from the path of seeing on up. These three categories of people deride the Desire Realm. The latter part of the phrase, “deride on many counts,”c goes with all three cate-gories. Another text refers to seven transmigratorsd who are excellent be-ings. They are all identified as Never Returners—seven types of Never Returners who will take rebirth in the Form Realm, become enlight-ened in the intermediate state, and so forth. These are special types of excellent beings, not the general type to which the above term refers. It is clear in sūtra that an excellent being is one who has attained the path of seeing, and so forth. The fourth fault of the Desire Realm is that, when one depends on the phenomena of the Desire Realm, one will accumulate one of the nine thorough enwrapments.e The Nine Thorough Enwrapments 1 thorough enwrapment of desiref 2 thorough enwrapment of angerg 3 thorough enwrapment of prideh 4 thorough enwrapment of doubti 5 thorough enwrapment of ignorancej 6 thorough enwrapment of [bad] view:k view of the transitory collec-               a gdugs dkar. b tshad ma’i skyes bu. c rnam grangs du ma’i sgo nas smad pa. d ’gro ba, gati. e kun tu sbyor ba, saṃyojana. f ’dod chags kyi kun sbyor, *rāgasaṃyojana. g khong khro’i kun sbyor, *pratighasaṃyojana. h nga rgyal gyi kun sbyor, *mānasaṃyojana. i the tshom gyi kun sbyor, *vicikitsāsaṃyojana. j ma rig pa’i kun sbyor, *avidyāsaṃyojana. k lta ba’i kun sbyor, *dṛṣṭisaṃyojana."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":" Mode of Analysis of Grossness/Peacefulness 367 tion [as real I and mine],a view holding to an extreme,b and wrong viewc 7 thorough enwrapment of misapprehension of the supreme:d con-ception of a [bad] view as supremee and conception of ethics and systems of behavior as supremef 8 thorough enwrapment of jealousyg 9 thorough enwrapment of miserlinessh The eighth and ninth, jealousy and miserliness, are chosen out of the long list of twenty secondary afflictive emotions because they are the two chief factors opposing altruism; helping others may be damaged through either jealousy or miserliness. Miserliness here does not refer only to resources; it means not using anything one might have—education, good qualities, and so forth—to help others. The five [bad] views are separated into two groups as divisions of the sixth and seventh thorough enwrapments because the first three, the divisions of thorough enwrapments of [bad] views, are like objects and the divisions of thorough enwrapment of misapprehension of the supreme are like subjects, or apprehenders. The first three [bad] views are the objects of the two consciousnesses that misapprehend the su-preme. It is these three that are viewed as marvelous. What distinguishes the various misconceptions of being supreme? The misconception of [bad] views as supreme involves only the concep-tions of the above three [bad] views as supreme; the conception of these as highly auspicious is the misconception that one has completely abandoned all afflictive emotions and that they will not return again. How could one have this view with respect to ethics? The term “ethics” or “mode of conduct” here does not refer only to our usual modes of behavior. It refers to the abandonment of the afflictive emo-tions and not only to the abandonment of bad activities such as killing. If one conceived that the abandonment of the ten non-virtues was highly auspicious in the sense of considering it to be a complete abandonment of cyclic existence, then that would be a case of conceiv-ing ethics and modes of conduct to be supreme, or better than they               a ’jig tshogs la lta ba, satkāyadṛṣṭi. b mthar ’dzing pa’i lta ba, antagrāhadṛṣṭi. c log lta, mithyādṛṣṭi. d lta ba mchog ’dzin gyi kun sbyor, *dṛṣṭiparāmarśasaṃyojana. e lta ba mchog ’dzin, dṛṣṭiparāmarśa. f tshul khrims dang brdul zhugs mchog ’dzin, śīlavrataparāmarśa. g phrag dog gi kun sbyor, *irṣyāsaṃyojana. h ser sna’i kun sbyor, *mātsaryasaṃyojana."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"368   Appendix   actually are. This thorough enwrapment could exist only up to the path of seeing because someone who has attained a Superior path actually has something that is highly auspicious inasmuch as some afflictive emotions have been utterly abandoned. Before that, on the paths of accumulation and preparation, if one conceived one’s attainments as some type of final abandonment, they would actually not be as auspi-cious as one conceived them to be. The illustrations often used in texts for this are, for instance, the asceticisms of non-Buddhists which are mistakenly conceived to be suf-ficient cause for attaining liberation. Some non-Buddhists believe that, as a result of their engaging in severe asceticism, the body dries up and becomes thin, and one’s sins diminish; thus, severe asceticism is in-cluded in this category. Buddhists might also have such a misapprehen-sion of the supreme, however, if, for example, they felt that abandon-ment of the ten non-virtues was sufficient for liberation. This would also be a case of exaggerating their value. Some people say that a per-son who conceives the supreme mistakenly must be a non-Buddhist, but this is not the case. The ethics which are the object of this view do not necessarily have to be bad. They may be bad only in the sense that they are not highly auspicious and one is wrongly satisfied with them alone. An illustration of a bad mode of conduct would be severe asceticism conceived as highly auspicious. A case of misconceiving ethics as highly auspicious would be to separate temporarily from attachment to afflic-tive emotions and to consider this as liberation. This does not mean whoever has any of these qualities is, as in the illustrations, a non-Buddhist. The fifth fault of the Desire Realm is that, when one depends on phenomena of the Desire Realm, there is not the least sinful non-virtue that one would not do. Those who have attained actual concentrations and actual formless absorptions are able to take good measure of them-selves, recognizing when their afflictive emotions are excessive. How-ever, when one is engaged in the afflictive emotions of the Desire Realm, it is difficult to take one’s own measure independently and to know what the limit should be. Asaṅga’s Grounds of Hearers makes many references to thorough en-tanglements,a such as the eight thorough entanglements: 1 non-shameb 2 non-embarrassmenta               a kun dkris, paryavasthāna. b ngo tsha med pa, āhrīkya."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":" Mode of Analysis of Grossness/Peacefulness 369 3 excitementb 4 contritionc 5 sleepd 6 lethargye 7 jealousyf 8 miserlinessg The first, non-shame, means not avoiding ill deeds from one’s own point of view—one’s own estimation of what one should be doing. It would be, for instance, not thinking about the future and not reflecting on what will happen if one engages in a certain ill deed. Non-embarrassment is a case of not avoiding ill deeds from the viewpoint of considering others. It means that no matter what one does, there is no concern for others’ estimation of oneself. The other thorough entan-glements have already been explained. These eight thorough entanglements are factors opposing the three trainings.h The first two are factors opposing proper ethics.i Excitement and contrition are factors opposing wisdom; sleep and lethargy are fac-tors opposing meditative stabilization. Jealousy and miserliness are fac-tors opposing all three trainings—ethics, wisdom, and meditative stabi-lization. This is because they are factors opposing altruism. Therefore, among these eight, the last two—jealousy and miserliness—are consid-ered in the Mahāyāna to be very strong and very bad...The sleep and contrition included within the eight thorough entanglements are only the non-virtuous forms, not the general ones. “Sleep” here is not merely sleepiness, but it could not include deep sleep. It is by way of motivation that sleep becomes non-virtuous.                                 a khrel med, anapatrāpya. b rgod pa, auddhatya. c ’gyod pa, kaukṛtya. d gnyid, middha. e rmug pa, styāna. f phrag dog, irṣyā. g ser sna, mātsarya. h bslab pa, śikṣā. i tshul krims, śīla."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" 371 List of Abbreviations “Dharma” refers to the sde dge edition of the Tibetan canon published by Dharma Press: the Nying-ma Edition of the sDe-dge bKa’-’gyur and bsTan-’gyur (Oakland, Calif.: Dharma, 1980). “Golden Reprint” refers to the gser bris bstan ’gyur (Sichuan, China: krung go’i mtho rim nang bstan slob gling gi bod brgyud nang bstan zhib ’jug khang, 1989). “Illumination” refers to the translation in this book of Tsong-kha-pa’s Illumination of the Thought: Extensive Explanation of (Chandrakīrti’s) “Supplement to (Nāgārjuna’s) ‘Treatise on the Middle’” “Insight” refers to the translation in this book of the special insight sec-tion of Tsong-kha-pa’s Medium-Length Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment “Karmapa sde dge” refers to the sde dge mtshal par bka’ ’gyur: A Facsimile Edition of the 18th Century Redaction of Si tu chos kyi ’byung gnas Pre-pared under the Direction of H.H. the 16th rGyal dbang Karma pa (Delhi: Delhi Karmapae Chodhey Gyalwae Sungrab Partun Khang, 1977). “Khangkar and Yorihito” refers to Tsultrim Kelsang Khangkar and Ta-kada Yorihito, A Study of Tsong khapa’s Mādhyamika Philosophy 1: An-notated Japanese translation of the Vipaśyanā Section of Medium Exposi-tion of the Stages of the Path (Lam rim).
