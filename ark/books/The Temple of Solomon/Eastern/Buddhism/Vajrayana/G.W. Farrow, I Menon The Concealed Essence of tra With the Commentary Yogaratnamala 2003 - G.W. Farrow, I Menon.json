I have lived in India and Nepal for fifteen years and during my stay there I was introduced to various Hindu and Buddhist sects. I have had personal contact with meditation masters of both religions including Neem Karoli Baba, Deoria Baba, Baba Ram Sevak Das, Mustram Baba, Ganesh Baba, Ram Nath Aghori Baba, Bhairava Baba, Vasudev Baba, Tarrig Rinpochel Trungu Rinpoche and Lama Sanjur. This contact has given me a broad view and a lasting interest in the practice of yoga and in the literature of the various sects to which these yogis belong. Since coming into contact with my co-translator and editor I. Menon our research into the tantric methods of practice led to the study of both Hindu and Buddhist tantric literature.We have translated some pre-viously untranslated tantric works. In addition to the translation pre-sented here we have translated later Hindu tantric works such as the Saktapramoda, Syamru-ahasyarp, Tararahasyarp, Yogakall).ika, siuvollasa Tantra etc., as well as earlier tantric works including the Kaulajnananimaya, selected chapters of Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka, the Vajrayana Buddhist Cai)damaharosaiJa Tantra, and also other texts. For the most part the Hindu tantric works we examined were concerned with cosmology, the different grades of practitioners and their appropriate styles of practice, the rituals for propitiating a variety of male and female deities, the rites of magic, KUQdaliru yoga and the definition of the nature of the guru and the realised practitioner. Among the existing Hindu tantric works we found that the most interesting are those belonging to the Kashmiri Saiva tradition, especially th-:>se of the Kashmiri tan~a. Abhinavagupta, some texts of the Snvidya tradition and texts belonging to the Natha Yogi sect. However, many basic questions regarding the foundations of the tantric method still remained to be conclusively answered. Namely, why male and female deities? Why certain colors and forms for these deities? Why and what are the families (kula) of deities? How are these families able to transform the manifested natures? Why is it necessary to propi-tiate and visualise the forms of the deities and their mal)dalas? How is"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"viii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra the complete union achieved? What is meant by 'the complete union' and how is the fruit of that union defined? In the course of our research we were first introduced to the text of the Yogara01ama1a by way of the critical version published in the Roman scrlpt in Professor D.L. Snellgrove's Hevajra Tantra, A Critical Study, volume II. This critical version has drawn upon manuscripts deposited in the archive libraries ofCambridge and Kathmandu. We are indebted to Professor Snellgrove for making available the critical texts of both the Hevajra Tantra and the Yogaratnamala. Readings of the Hevajra Tantra and Yogaratnamala established that these texts contained definitive information regarding the principles of tantric theory, practice and experience. Therefore, we decided to trans-late both the Hevajra Tantra and the Yogaratnainala. In order to commence our research and translation work we obtained photo-copies of other versions of these two texts as well as copies of various other Buddhist Tantric texts from the National Archives of the Government of Nepal. We consulted the twelfth century, incomplete text of the Yogaratnamala deposited in the Royal Asiatic Society in Calcutta. In order to clarify some parts of the root text and the commentary we also consulted a photo-copy of a manuscript of Ratnakarasanti's Muktavall which is another commentary on the Hevajra Tantra. The Muktavali incorporates and amplifies the interpretation found in the Yogaratnamala. The Hevajra Ta..'1tra dates from approximately the eighth century A.D. The treatise is composed of discourses between the Bhagavan Buddha and his disciple Vajragarbha. In the second part there are dis-courses between the Bhagavan and his consort as well. These discourses are the vehicle v.{hich intmduce the theory, practice and experience of the Krama, the Processes of the Buddhist tantric method. The Hevajra Tantra,like other Buddhist Siitras and Tantras, ;::ommences with the Nidanavakyam, the Fundamental Statement. This opening state-ment of doctrine begins with the crucial phrase evaiJl maya srutarp (Thus have I heard). The Fundamental Statement is the source for the expose of the Upaya, the Means, the modes of practice which are introduced and outlined in the first chapter and which are then further explained and elaborated in the rest of the treatise. This Fundamental Statement and the tantric system of language which is contained within it's composition will be explained and discussed in the Introduction. The YogaratnamaHi also k.i10wn as the Hevajra Pafijika was written around the ninth century A.D. and is a commentary on the Hevajra Tantra. The Yogaratnamala was written in the Pafijika style by the pandit"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Preface ix and Mahasiddha, KrsiJ.acarya. Because the Yogaratnamala is written in the Pafijika style, where words or phrases from successive units of the root treatise are taken and c01p.mented upon, we·decided to translate the Hevajra Tantra and the Yogaratnamala simultaneously. Bearing this idea of compositional style in mind and also in order to thoroughly highlight the unique material found in both texts we have melded both texts so that they can be read together. The root treatise has been broken up to form units of related subject matter. These units, transcribed in the Roman script are presented together with the English translation to facilitate the easy comprehension of the material which is being commented upon. Also, by this method of translating with an important commentary, the views of the commentator, Kr-;Qacarya, as found in the commentary, play a cruGial role in the over.all tone and thrust of the translation of the more difficult, terse and understated style of the root treatise. Many of the technical terms found in the Hevajra Tantra are to be found in earlier Hmayana and Mahayana works. However, we have translated technical terms according to the Vajrayana view by following Kn;IJ.acarya's analysis of these terms. In the glossary we have explained the reasoning for our translation of technical terms such as Sarpvara, Sam ad hi etc. The Hevajra Tantra, like other Buddhist tantras, is written without too much attention to the rules of classical Sanskrit grammar. This unsophisticated style accords with the view on compositional style found in the Pradipodyotana commentary on the Guhyasamaja Tantra and the Vimalaprabhii commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra. Nevertheless, the writer or writers of this treatise have composed a sophisticated work in terms of the subject matter found in the treatise. The root treatise conveys, without unnecessary embellishments, fundamental information regard-ing the processes of the tantric method. Sometimes the vernacular of that era has been utilised to define crucial views regarding the tantric method. The straightforward approach which we employed in the trans-lation of these texts was influenced by the unsophisticated but essential compositional style of Buddhist tantras. Who were the Mahasiddhas? What was special about their era? The Mahasiddhas or Great Accomplishers were the synthesizers and system-atzers of the tantric tradition during the classic tantric period between the fifth century and the thirteenth century A.D. They were the foremost exponents of the tantric method by virtue of their own direct personal experience of the instructions given to them by their own gurus. This made them particularly suited tQ define the style and conduct of the tantric method. They were the founders ofthe seven instruction lineages"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"X The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra which are held to-day by the Tibetan Buddhist Kargyupa, Saskyapa and Gelugpa sects. The oldest Buddhist sect of Tibet, the Nyingmapa, includes many methods of these Mahasiddha lineages but relies mainly on the methods transmitted by Guru Rinpoche, Padmasambhava, and on the later body of hidden texts which are discovered and revealed from time to time. The tantric system of the Mahasiddhas was created out of the. refined use of a variety of practices found in other traditions as well as the evolution of mainstream Buddhist practices. With this inclusive attitude the Mahasiddhas were able to attract a very wide range of followers from all social contexts. The existing religious practices of these followers were sometimes utilized but were adapted .and refined by the adoption of the tantric view of the Wisdom and Means method. The Mahasiddhas were the innovators with and the refiners of, existent social and religious conditions and were therefore the continuers of indigenous Indian cultural·continuity because of their inclusive attitude. However, due to this contact with and conversion of previously non-Buddhist groups many non-Buddhist methods were synthesized and introduced into the Buddhist mainstream. This is demonstrated in the Hevajra Tantra where Hindu deities such as Brahma etc., tantric symbolism of other traditions, such as the five symbolic ornamepts of th~ Kapa.Iikas, yoga methods, such as the Yonimudra of the Kaulas, and tribal warrior modes such as the skilful use of weapons by a hero arc introduced, adapted and refined for use in the Buddhist tantric method. In this way the ancient shamanistic yoga tradition which pre-dates the arrival of the Aryans in the sub-continent was assimilated and refined to suit the needs of the Buddhist tantric yogis. In terms of the systematization of the tantric method, the texts of the Mahasiddhas translated into Tibetan which are collected in the Tangyur and Kangyur as well as in existing Sanskrit manuscripts attest to their work in this field. The Six Yogas ofNaropa are well known in this context. The influence of the Eighty-four Siddhas can be noted in existing Hindu sects such as the Natha Yogi sect, the Dattatreya cult and the Naga yogiS of the Dasanami sannyasins. Their influence is even felt in the later V aisQava sects found in Northern and Eastern India·as well as in the Sikh religion. This influence is seen through the use of yoga practices which -Originate from the Natha yogi sect as well as the incorporation of the Sahaja view of earlier Buddhist sects. These kinds of yoga practices and views are principal themes found in some of the songs and poems of Kabir and his peers. Some of these songs are collected in the Adi Granth"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Preface xi Sahib, the holy work of the Sikhs from the Indian Punjab. Similar kinds of songs and poems are also to be found in other works of the North Indian Sant tradition. The tradition of expressing religious concepts in the vernacular as against the literati, Sanskrit and elite caste tradition of the orthodox Brahmins was taken to it's logical conclusion by Tulasi Das in his classic Hindi formulation of the RamayaJJ.a. In this manner the influence of the non-elitist tantric masters can be definitely felt in the development of the Sant tradition. Today, itinerant members of the Baul sect of Bengal still sing Sahaja songs. The tradition of religious vernacular song is an ancient method of teaching the theories of yoga to the common man by way of allegories contained in the songs. In the sub-continent oflndia some of the earliest collected examples of this tradition are the early Buddhist gathas and the carya songs of the Mahasiddhas. However, this oral tradition should be considered as much older than these Buddhist songs. Who was KrsJJ.acarya? According to Taranatha's Seven Instruction Lineages, KrsJJ.acai\"ya is a very important master of the Innate Radiance lineage and the Karmamudra lineage. KrsJJ.acarya was born into the Brahmin caste in eastern India. His guru ·was Jalandhara. A prophecy stated that a yogi like him had not appeared before nor would aJ;tother like him appear again. In his cary a songs, i<.rSJJ.acarya proclaims himself to be a Kapalika Yogi. He is said to have attained the eight magical accom-plislunents in addition to the Mahamudra Accomplishment. His six principal disciples Bhadrapada, Mahila, Bhadala, Tshembupa, Dhamapa and Dhumapa are all said to have attained the Mahamudra Accomplish-ment. It is said that he was afflicted by pride because of his magical accomplislunents. Accordjng to Abhayadatta's biography of the Eighty-four Siddhas, KrsJJ.acarya was instructed by his guru Jalandhara to seek instruction from another of Jalandhara's disciples, a weaver. Through interplay and instructions received from his fellow disciple he overcame his obscuring pride. Later he realized the Mahamudra Accomplishment. There are conflicting accounts as to whether his attainment of the Mahamudra Accomplishment was realized in his lifetime or in the intermediate state following his death or even if he realized the Mahamudra Accomplishment at all. However, his importance as a lineage master is attested by the inclusion of sixty-four of his works in the Tangyur. The practice with a Wisdom consort, a female practitioner, is an integral part of the radical, purelytantric method advocated by KrsJJ.acarya. KrsJJ.acarya epitomizes the wild, unattached, Kapalika yogi who could easily and mercilessly draw attention to the hypocrisies of the religious"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra and social conventions of the day. He lived and roamed in the cremation grounds and in the jungles, alone orwithhis consorts. Yet he was also able to be completely assured in the intellectual hotbeds of the great monas-teries and universities. These qualities mixed with magical accomplish-ments give hints as to the stature of this awesome and unconventional yogi. It is quite possible that the conflicts and confusions regarding the biography of KrsiJ.acarya stern from prejudices held by some later commentators against the whole idea pf such direct views and methods. The utilization of the Prajfia, the Wisdom consort, during the Consecra-tion Rite and the subsequent practice is the view of the style of transmis-sion and of the method found in the Hevajra Tantra and the commentary the Yogaratnamala by KrsiJ.acarya. In India, Buddhist devotees suited to the methods of the Hinayana and the Mahayana were able to receive consecrations from the monks following those styles of practice. Those suited to the tantric Vajrayana method were given consecration and instructions by the yogis. Accord-ing to the Blue Annals, a history of the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet, the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions of India were again introduced and transplanted into Tibet from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries A.D. prior to and during the Muslim invasions which finally destroyed the great Buddhist monasteries and universities in northern and eastern India. Once these traditions were re-established in Tibet the distinct and purely tantric view and method of the Indian Buddhist yogis became more and more mixed with that of the monk orientated Mahayana method. This monastic ascendency blurred the view of the distinct stages of discipline and preparation which are necessary prior to tantric conse-cration. In this regard it is important to understand the the role of the Yoga Tantras and other dual Mother and Father tantric cycles and their relationship with the Yogiru or non-dual Anuttara Tantras. From the point of view of the Hevajra Tantra, a Yogiru tantra, the first consecra-tion, the Master Consecration, is equated with the culmination of the Kriya Tantras. The culmination of the Carya Tantra is the second consecratio~ the Secret Consecration. The second consecration is the practice of the Sole Hero method which was to be performed until some 'heat' was accomplished. A similar method was utilized for the yogiru, the female practitioner, by the application of the culmination of a dual, Mother, Carya tantra. This is the Process of Generation. Once the disciple achieved some 'heat' he was deemed ready to enter the third consecra-tion, the Wisdom Consecration and practice with the consort. This is the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Preface xiii culmination of the Yoga Tantra, and is the Process of Completion. Then, after, the yogi and yogiru were consecrated into the non-dual Yogiru Tantra, that is, were given the Fourth Consecration. The culmination or fruit of the Fourth Consecration is said to be the uncreated Innate (sahaja) nature. The non-dual view represents the view of the Process of Perfection during the Fourth Consecration. However the culmination stages of the second and third consecrations are applied by means of the view-point of the Process of Perfection. That is, the culminations of the Processes of Generation and Completion are applied by means of the view-point of the Process ofPerfection. The exact nuances of the view of the Processes are only given by the guru. In this way the Hevajra Tantra incorporates the dual tantras as the preliminaries for the non-dual culmination. Initially, in the Hevajra cycle, the realizations of the processes were achieved during the consecration rite and subsequently, by means of the consort practice. Later the yogi or yogiru could generate the complete iqnerunion achieved by way of the consort practice, alone. Each way was deerp.ed useful when used at the appropriate time. In this way the dynamic role and relationship of the culminations of the dual class oftantras and the non-dual Anuttara class of tantras are indicated. Generally,_ today, the use of a Wisdom consort in the consecration rite and in the stages of the method has been dropped in favour of the Erotic Metaphor of Union. Even so, practice with a Wisdom consort is reserved for very advanced disciples. The confused view of the stage by stage development of practices was caused .and enforced by fears for the moral welfare of the disciples. It would appear that the zeal of some sects to propagate their concordance of the Mahayana and Vajrayana method made them lose sight of the fact that in India during the classic 'tantric period only those devotees who were deemed especially suited to the radical tantric yoga method ·were selected and consecrated by the Mahasiddha yogiS. Therefore,when examining the use of the radical tantric practices found in the Hevajra Tantra it must be borne in mind that during Krsoacarya's period it was very difficult to obtain tantric consecFation and tantric precepts. Why was this so? It was recognized in India, as it was later in Tibet, that the radical tantric method of practice was not suitable for most devotees. Bowever, in India, tantric consecration was only bestowed upon carefully selected aspirants. The Buddhist tantric yogis in India put little store in the mass propagation of the tantric method because of the unsuitable views and attitude of most devotees. These"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xiv The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra yogiS felt no need to impress the temporal rulers of Northern and East-em India with a concordance of all Buddhist schools of thought in order to establish the ascendency of any one monastic sect, as can be seen later in Tibet in the relationships between the dominant monastic sects and the Emperors of Orlna. The mass propagation of the Mahayana/V ajrayana religion in Tibet meant the unavoidable watering down of the tantric view of the method in order to make practices readily and safely available to the populace in general. ID India the careful assessment and choice of disciples was carried out by the lineage gurus. Only suitable candidates were accepted. On1;y those of the strongest capability were given immediate tantric consecra-tion. Others were introduced to the methods of the tantric cycles by way of study after being consecrated with the Master Consecration. They were also put through preliminary tests. Only determined aspirants were given further consecrations. Even the very strongest disciples W'\\fe often on1y givenoneconsecrationata time. The biographies oftheMahasiddhas offer graphic accounts of the ordeals and tests that the unripened, but strongest-of-sensibility aspirants, suffered and endured in order to obtain the consecrations and precepts which led to the realization of the Mahamudra Accomplishment Therefore, in India the mo~ ~elfare of the practitioners ang the correct attitude tow_ards the.llldical practices of the tantric lineages was guarded by the careful sel.ection method employed by the tantric gurus. The view of the method and the view of consecration rite found in the Hevajra Tantra and the Yogaratnamal.a are the tantric views of the Buddhist Mahasiddha Yogi Tradition. Today, why is· there a necessity to unflinchingly research and evaluate the Vajrayana tradition founded by the Mahasiddha yogiS? The last transplantation of Vajrayana Buddhism from India into Tibet was methodically planned and executed. It was a project which took some hundreds of years to complete. A vast number oftexts were translated, hence the Tangyur and Kangyur. Since the fall of Tibet to the Chinese communists and the exile of the Tibetan masters another transplantation ofVajrayana is taking place. This transplantation is now occurring in the westernized nations, particularly in North America and Europe. In line with the age of mass communic~tion, pop-culture and easy travel the transference of V ajrayana and the introduction of Buddhism in general into the west is rapidly occurring. However, the vast majority of the population in the west are ignorant of and unaffected by this transference and generally speaking interest in Buddhism is small but growing. In this"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Preface XV expanding assembly of devotees there is a lack, due to language barriers, of available, basic, root, study material regarding the origins oftOday's tradition. The Vajrayana yogi method was forged from a variety of religious and social elements found in India in the early centuries A.D. Therefore, to interested parties, this translation of an important root tantric treatise should be a useful indicator of the refined Vajrayana method. The root tantra indicates the basic tradition which was systematized by the Mahasiddhas during the classic tantric period of the fifth to the thirteenth centuries A.D. The systemization of this broad based tradition is indi-cated by means of the commentary presented here. Throughout it's history in India, Buddhism had to compete with and was influenced by and in it) turn influenced the other indigenous religions. In India the various soCial situations found in tribal, village and urban contexts were also influential in the evolvement of the Buddhist tantric tradition found there. This systematized tradition was totally transferred into Tibet by the end of the thirteenth century. Physically, climatically and demographically Tibet is in contrast to India. Once well-established, the Tibetan tantric tradition evolved in an almost exclu-sively Buddhist religious environment which had not exis.ted in India. The monastic view was the preferred view for the safe practice of the tantric, Vajrayana method in Tibet. After centuries of political and doctrinal rivalry bet'veen the various Mahayana/V ajrayana monastic orders, a conservative view of the method which was acceptable to all the sects was fully evolved by the nineteenth century. Since the fall of Tibet to the Chinese communists and the exile of the Tibetan masters the tradition is continuing and evolving today in various parts of the world through the transmission of teachings by the existing Tibetan sects. The cultural and personal backgrounds of Westerners are very different from those of Tibetans and not much long term value can be placed in venerating and conforming to another's religious tradition without rational and intelligible reasons for doing so. Hence a valid need, because of the introduction oftantric values into another social context, for clear, rational and intelligent information regarding the vibrant and essential features which make up the tantric tradition. Fossilized, mis-leading, exoteric views, usages and superstitions, so often encountered and assimilated when living in the east, are of no real value in the new western context Indeed these views, usages and superstitions must be shorn away from the relevant material in order that the timeless essentials of the tantric tradition can be presented to, transmitted to and assimilated"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xvi The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra by discriminating, intelligent westerners. Therefore, whilst establishing this base for the Vajrayana in the west a foundation of essential, basic, Buddhist tantric values, which are comprehendible in the new western context, must be created and assimilated by the western assembly of devotees. The spiritual and social values of the western nations are very different from the values of classical Tibet and India. In India the Mahasiddhas crafted the tantric method or'breaking incompatible con-ventional social views and the modes of the application of the vow to suit the social mores and imagination of their era. Indian Buddhist Tantra was adopted and introduced wholesale into Ti~t and was the cultural basis for the feudal, theocratic society which developed there. Now that. the West is a new base for Tantric Buddhism it should be bo.me in mind that the tantric tradition is now being established in a twentieth century, com-pletely non-Buddhist society. The religious conventions, social mores and dream icons of a twentieth century society are very different and often alien to the values found in classical Indian and Tibetan societies. In this respect in order to firmly establish the Vajrayana tradition in the totally different religious and social environment of the west a new appraisal of the whole Buddhist tradition must be undertaken and within the basic framework of the tantric method new modes for the application of the vow should be evolved to suit the new social situation. The modes of the application of the vow were evolved to counter hindering social and religious views which were to be found in India a thousand years ago. Tantric practices, such as visualization, were made easier to perform by giving the male or female deities attributes which suited the predilections of that time and place. Similarly, the utility of the tantric yogi's modes of conduct and style of dress were crafted to break incorrect and incompatible religious and social views on the nature of existence and on the nature of religious experience whilst at the same time were able to engender the correct tantric views on these subjects. These modes of conduct and styles of dress had utility because they involved the use of views, objects and situations found in the practitio-ner's own society and because they directly related to what was occur-ring within that society. At present there is a need to evolve modes of tantric conduct and symbolism in the application of the vow which are suitable to counteract incorrect and incompatible religious and social views found in a twentieth century society. This means that the three piece business suit, the jewelry and so on commonly found with twentieth century individuals should be given"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Preface xvii symbolic utility by which the initiate is able to affirm the tantric view, just as previously, the yogi's apparel and accessories were able to affirm such a view. With this updating of the application of the vow the anonymity of the practitioner and the secrecy of the modes of practice can be easily maintained. By a wholesale and indiscriminate adoption of Tibetan mores and dress, which are suited to another time and culture, there is a real danger that the modes of conduct and of dress utilized in the application of the vow will become meaningless by not having any real utility, other than of novelty, in the new social context. In this respect there is a real need for preliminary study of the root tantras in order that the practitioners can be introduced to an historical view regarding the application of the vow as well as being introduced to the full breadth of the tantric method. With this introduction to an historical view on the application of the vow practitioners should become more receptive to the forward thinking and evolutionary ideas of the late Trungpa Rinpoche and other like minded Tibetan masters on this subject. The intellects and appetites of westerners arc very developed in the modem materialistic society. Due to these factors few westerners will be naturally suited to the monastic way. The tantric method of transforma-tion, once the prior, necessary, discipline and preparation arc achieved, would appear to be more appropriate for taming and transforming the natures of suitable westerners. In this respect the tantric view of practice in relation with the practices of the other schools of Buddhism should be clearly established. Within the assembly of devotees this stage by stage development of practices should be taught and understood. Only by this understanding of the evolution of practices can the correct view of the radical tantric method be gained. Once this view is gained any possible anomalies seen between the tantric yoga method as prescribed in the Hevajra Tantra and other Anuttara tantras which include the culminations of the Kriya, Carya and Yoga Tantras and the monk's method as prescribed in the Hinayana and Mahayana traditions·will be resolved. Therefore, if the transplanta-tion of Buddhist Tantra into the west is to be successful and balanced an overview of the totality of the Buddhist tantric tradition should, at the very least; be examined, researched and appraised. Phuket, Thailand 1990 George W. Farrow"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction In the research of any tradition it is necessary to delve into that tradition in its entirety sifting the relevant from the irrelevant. These translations of the Hevajra Tantra and the previously untranslated Yogaratnamala are presented in order to assist the study of the origins and basis of the Vajrayana tradition. The root tteatise and its commentary will enable students of religion to comprehend the theories of the Vajrayana method. These translations will introduCe Sanskrit Vajrayana terminology which succinctly expresses the view of the tantric method. The tantric system oflanguage which was employed by the Mahasiddha tradition in the composition of Buddhist tantric texts will also be clearly indicated. Study of these texts will indicate the real necessity for a competent and well versed tantric guru in order to be consecrated into the tantric method of practice. By study it will become apparent that the need to cultivate a firm commitment is essential in <;>rder to strictly follow the detailed instructions for the stages of the practice which are given by the guru after consecration. These treatises could also be profitably studied by students of comparative religion seeking for keys to unlock the meaning of symbolism found in other religious traditions. In order that the tantric method of Wisdom and Means can be perceived as a dynamic force for transformation, the other schools of Buddhism should be viewed as necessary stages of discipline and preparation required to arrive at the developed stage oftantric practice. The Vajrayana tradition was and is a radical development of orthodox Buddhism in that it does not outright reject the body and the emotions which colour the personality. The Vajrayana method utili~s and refines the basic emotions which arise in the body as· the very means for total transformation. Here there is no asceticism, only prior discipline and preparation for the radical and dangerous tantric method of practice. According to the tantric view, because the emotions arise in the body the deities are said to reside in the body. The presence of the deities is therefore confirmed by the arising of the unpurified emotions. The work of the yogi is first, by means of the method of the Process of Generation, to. purify the obscuring, unrefmed emotional natures by continually iden-tifying with ihe form and nature of the appropriate principal deity. The"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction xix appropriate principaJ, male or female deity is also that with which the yogi or yogiru identifies during the further processes of the meth6d, the Processes of Completion and Perfection. The positive and negative emotions found in the personality are th~ unpurified manifestations of the principal deities .. The appropriate family of male and female deities and their retinues are bestowed upon the disciple by the guru, by means of the consecration rite, only after ascer-taining the dominant emotion which colours the personality of the disciple. This is the 'in character' introduction and entry into the family of a particular deity antidote. By this 'in character' introduction the various emotional natures are transfonned by the Mudra, the Seal, of the appropriate deity family. Therefore, the disciple of a lustful nature is assigned to the lust family deity and so on. All types of positive and negative natures are dealt with in this manner. These natures are made not to arise in the mind of the disciple by being sealed with Wisdom, non-sub-stantiality. This non-substantiality of the dominant nature is achieved in the Process of Generation through the application of the appropriate Wisdom deity antidote. In order to fully examine, research and appraise the Krama, the Processes of Generation, Completion and Perfection, found in the Hevajra Tantra it is first necessary to examine and understand the compositional components of a Vajrayana tantric treatise. In the com-mentary,followingtheviewfoundintheUttaraTantraoftheGuhyasamaja Tantra, it is said that a tantra is a treatise which has three compositional facets, namely the Source facet of the tantra, the Fruit facet of the tantra and the Means facet of the tantra. The Source is said to be the beings belonging to the Vajra family. In the Hevajra Tantra, the Vajra family members are the players in. the drama of the Buddha (buddhanataka). Their dialogue is the vehicle through which the nature of and the means to the enlightened state of the Buddhas are revealed. The Fruit is said to be the perfected Hevajra, that is, the Vajradhara with the fonn ofHevajra. Th€?Means are the methods of practice which are described in the Hevajra Tantra. Wisdom and Means, which are synonymous with the female and male deities respectively, are principai Salllvara, Concealed Essences. The Hevajra Tantra can therefore be described as a.treatise which utilizes triple compositional components in order l}lat the means to and the fruit of the union or mingling of Wisdom and Means can be explained. The compositional components are the threads by which the Kramas, the Processes of Generation, Completion and Perfection are clearly ex-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"XX The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra pressed and thereby familiarity with the yoga method of Wisdom and Means attained. The three compositional components are used in the composition of all the principal Buddhist tantra.s. The processes of the Vajrayana method are comprisedofinstructions for the stages of practice which lead to the va(ious states of Samadhi, the stabilized meditative states. These various blissful, stabilized meditative states are the culminations of particular stages of pracdce within a proc-ess and are also the culminations of each process. From these stabilized meditative states the various psychic powers arise. However these blissful states and their powers are only staging points on the way to full enlightenment. Enlightenment is the culmination of the third process, the Process of Perfection. Enlightenment, in tantric tetms, is the direct personal experience of the final culminating stabilized meditative state, the Sonyatasamadhi, the Stabilised Meditative State of Voidness. This is the Mahamudra Siddhi, the Accomplishment of the Great Seal, which is described as ~ing the experience of the Great Bliss (mahasukha). How are the Processes of Generation, Completion and Perfection defined? In the initial process, the Process of Generation (utpattikrama), the fonns of the male and female deity are visualized within their complete maiJ.dalas. Their fonns, maodalas, symbols and seed syllables are used to snare and purify the various. arising manifestations of the personality. The purification by means of the form of the deity etc., is necessary in order to proceed to the Process of Completion. In the Process of Completion (utpannakrama) the union of the two purified fonns, maiJ.dalas and the seed syllables of the deities of Wisdom and Means is performed. At this stage the absolute Innate nature is not fully apparent. In the Process of Perfection (nispannakrama) this embryonic manifesta-tion of the Innate is nurtured and matured until the Enlightened Con-sciousness, the Innate nature of the Adamantine Being (vajrasattva) is revealed. These arc the processes towards the· Mahamudra Accomplish-ment. The actualization of the Process of Perfection, the Mahamudra Accomplishment, is said to be the realization of the Absolute Voidness of all Natures. This realization of Absolute Voidness is said to be the nature of the Bhagavan. The nature of tlus realization is described at the beginning of the Hevajra Tantra by the phrase evarn maya, thus have I. How is the nature of the Bhagavan indicated by the phrase evarp. maya? All Buddhist Tantric treatises contain hidden information which can be only known by applying the tantric system oflanguage analysis. The method of Wisdom and Means is woven into tantric Buddhist treatises by means of this"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introduction xxi tantric system oflanguage. A very elaborate system of tantric language analysis is to be found in Candraklrti's Pradipodyotana commentary on the Guhyasamaja Tantra. The tantric system oflanguage analysis found in the Hevajra Tantra and Yogaratnamala will now be demonstrated. The principal deity and name of the treatise, Hevajra, will be utilized to demonstrate this tantric system of language employed in the compo-sition of tantric treatises. 'This name also indicates the basic view of the method of practice found in the Hevajra Tantra and all other principal root tantras. How is this possible? In the Hevajra Tantra the name Hevajra is analyzed as being composed of the syllable He, symbolizing Compas-sion and Vajra, symbolizing Voidness. Voidness and Compassion are synonymous with Prajfia, Wisdom and Upaya, Means. In this manner the name Hevajra indicates the basic method, that of uniting Voidness and Compassion. Voidness and Compassion are the natures of the female and male deities. This analysis of the word Hevajra demonstrates that hidden meaning is contained in the name of the principal deity of this non-dual tantric cycle. Within the treatise phrases, words and syllables are used in this manner. This means that names and words· like Hevajra, Bhagavan, Vajrasattva, SI1heruka, Nairatmya, Evarp., Bhaga, V ajra, Padma etc., have more subtle meanings-than their usual definitions. These other subtle definitions must be continually borne in mind when researching and analyzing the treatise. Therefore, in order to attain the necessary familiarity with and comprehension of the method ofWisdom and Means revealed in the Hevajra Tantra it is important to understand Lhe signifi-cance of how the treatise is composed and how the tantric system of language is woven into the treatise to contain· secret but fundamental details of the method. This tantric system of language is utilized in order to shield the true meaning from the uninitiated. For the initiated this method enables the writer to economize on the repetition of details regarding the concepts found within the treatise. This means that once basic concepts have been defined they can, for convenience, be contained within certain key names, words or phrases. In order to understand the profound nature of tantric treatises this system has to be fully understood. The first and principal example of the tantric system of language found within the Hevajra Tantra is the opening unit. This opening unit is known as the Fundamental Statement (nidanavakyarn) and is described in the commentary as that which is revealed within the Sutras and the Tantras. The opening fundamental statement is a declaration of the basic"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra doctrine. In order to be able to analyze this fundamental statement the verse and translation are now reproduced here: evaiJ). maya srutam ekasmin samaye bhagavan sarvata-thagatakayavak.cittavajrayosidbhagesu vijahara// Thus have I heard: At one time Bhagavan dwelt in the wombs of the Vajra Lady which are the Body, Speech and Mind of all the Buddhas. (1.1.1) The Fundamental Statement is a description, in yogic terms, of the realized state of the Bhagavan. This statement indicates the centers of the Body, Speech and Mind which are located in the Buddha realms within the yogi's body. The phrase evaiJI maya .srutaJTl gives, by means of the tantric system of language, an insight into the enlightened state and provides details of the method. How is this possible? Take the word evaJTl, 'thus'. In the early Gupta script the lettere was written as a downward facing triangle and the syllable vam was written as an upwards facing triangle. Here this letter e is said to represent the Lotus o·r the female sexual organ and the syllable vaQl is said to represent Vajra or the male sexual organ. These two sexual organs are synonymous with the mother and fathermandalas, the abodes ofWisdom and Means, that is, the abodes of Voidness and Compassion. They are the two principal components, the Concealed Essences. The perfected union is symbolised by the placing of the syllable vam in the letter e. This six-pointed star is said to symbolise the Sahaja, the uncreated Innate nature, the Enlightened Consciousness. In this way the means to the Innate and the Innate state are indicated by the components and in the formation one word. Although this symbolism was lost in later scripts the import was the same because the components are still the letter e and the syllable VaJTl. Such is the analysis of the key word, the concealed essence, evaiJI. Now the phrase evam maya. In the commentary the Bhagavan states that his doctrine is. to be known by the proper consideration of evaiJI maya, 'thus have I'. How is this possible? As previously stated, by means of the tantric system oflanguage, evam is able to represent the union of the principal concealed essences of Wisdom and Means. Maya, 'have I', is said to symbolise the activation of that union. Therefore evam maya refers to the successful activation or actualization of the method of min-gling Wisdom and Means. The Process of Generation (utpattikrama) is indicated by the letter e and the syllable vam. These two components of the word evam represent the purified male and female, solar and lunar deities and their maQdalas, the two principal concealed essences. The"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction xxiii Process of Completion (utpannakrama) is indicated by the union of these two components and the fonnation of the word evarp.. That is, the union of these two components syinbolizes the union of tbe two deities of Wisdom and Means. The successful activation of the Process ofPerfec~ tion (nispannakrama), the culmination of the evarp. method and the realization of the Innate nature, is indicated by the word maya, 'have I'. In this manner the Processes to Buddhahood, the Means, can be indicated and defined through such a tantric language analysis of the phrase evarp. maya, 'thus have I'. By adding the word srutarp., 'heard' further details of the doctrine are indicated. It is said srutarp., 'heard', refers to that which is heard, that is, the full expose of the doctrine regarding the Innate nature heard in the assembly of devotees. The Innate, the Enlightened Consciousness is said to be of two types, the relative, limited aspect of the Innate and the absolute, unlimited Innate nature. The refined utilization of the limited aspect of the Innate, which is said to be semen, is the harnessing of the libido in order to emanate the fonns and maQ.dalas of the male or female deities. This is the view-point of the Process of Generation. The absolute, unlimited Innate nature is said to be Bliss which is the view-point of the Process of Perfection. In this way the code phrase evarp. maya srutarp., 'thus have I heard', indicates and defines the method to the Innate nature, the Enlightened Consciousness. In the tantric view the Bhagavan is defmed as the one who possesses Bhaga, the womb, which is the source. The wombsofthe VajraLady are the sources of the Body, Speech and Mind of the Buddhas. These wombs are the Secret Centers. These three centers are located in the three realms or bodies of Creation, Enjoyment and Essential Nature. These· three realms comprise the Source of Nature, theDhannodaya. The Centers are the focal points of these realms. The primordial Source is the radiant, uncreated void, the Innate experienced in the Mind center located in the Body of Essential Nature (dhamiakaya). The other sources, the Body center located in the Body of Creation (ninnat)akaya) and the Speech center located in the Body ofEnjoyment (sarp.bhogakaya), are subsidiary to the primordial Source found in the Body of Essential Nature. During the application of the Process of Perfection these are the so·urces which are utilized in the actualization of the Mahamudra Accomplishment The realization of the Mahamudra is the realization of the adamantine nature. The being who possesses the adamantine nature is known as Vajrasattva, the Adamantine Being.

By this kind of wise reasoning Vajrasattva, the Adamantine Being is so called.' (1.1.4). In this manner the hidden details of the doctrine con-tained in the Fundamental Statement are indicated by means of the tantric system of language analysis. The Hevajra Tantra contains and defines the Means, the methods of practice. These Means are said to be Sarp.vara, the Concealed Essence, Abhiseka, the Consecration, Sandhyabhiisa. the Tantric Code Language, Ananda, the Joys, Ksaoa, the Moments and Carya, the Applications of the Vow as well as Bhojana, the Feast and so on. The Means which are revealed in the Hevajra Tantra are known ac; the Fundamentals o,f All Tantras:The Hevajra Tantra reveals the fundamental Means and can be considered as a yardstick for ascertaining the fundamentals of the theory, practice and experience of the tantric method. The Hevajra Tantraestab-lishes a standard by which other tantric treatises can be judged. These fundamental means will now be discussed. The radical· concepts of tantric theory, practice and experience described in the root treatise, the Hevajra Tantra and the commentary, the Yogaratnamala are not for those who rely on orthodox interpretations regarding what does or does not constitute valid religious practice. This is so because the radical concepts of this kind of religious method cannot be properly understood or assimilated from the cosy view-point of conformism or orthodoxy. The tantric method is_unorthodox, exacting, difficult and dangerous. For many students of religion the concept of the multi-stage development of practices is unknown. In this respect it should oo recognized that the Buddhist tantric view of the method can only be correctly understood by the serious study of the Hinayana and Mahayana schools. Once mastery of their view-points is gained the perception of the tantric method of practice will becorr.e clearer. A matured view is especially needed regarding the practices found in the root tantric texts, whether the texts are in the Sanskrit or Tibetan languages. Sarp.vara, Concealed Essence, is so called because it is concealed (samvrta) in the body and because it is the choicest (vara) of essences. Concealed Essence has two categories. The first category is the underly-ing, Concealed Essence of all things, the innate Enlightened Conscious-ness. The second category contains the various Concealed Essences used in the tantric yoga method. Regarding this second category in the commentary it states that the Concealed Essence is that by which the yogi must resolve the externalised gross phenomenal manfestations and inter-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction XXV nalize them. There are different kinds and different uses for the Con-cealed Essences in the various Processes. The male and female procreative quintessences of our progenitors, which created our bodies, are the basis for the concept of concealed essences which are utilised in the yoga method. How is this possible? The union of the two procreative essences, at the time of conception completes the procreative drama. The embryo is formed. The absolute Concealed Essence, the Innate nature and its relative, limited aspect are simultane-ously present at the time when the embryo is conceived. The limited aspect of the Innate is represented by the procreative essences of the male and the female, the semen and the ova. When unified these transmitters of the genetic codes will go on to form the body and the basic natures of the mind. The fully formed, limited, relatiye mind, created from the genetically inherited traits is generally unaware and ignorant of the absolute, unlimited, Enlightened Consciousness, the Concealed Essence of all things, which is present at the conception moment. The absolute, unlimited, Enlightened Consciousness, the Innate, is perceived as the divine, underlying factor of existence. The nature of this underlying Enlightened Consciousness is the vibrant, radiant voidness, the concealed essence of existence. This essential nature encompasses all things, at all times and also beyond all time. The union of the procreative essences allows the sacred and the profane to co-exist until the dissolu-tion of the body. The sacred is the infinite, divine nature which is never extinguished nor is even created.-The relative, finite, aspect of the Innate is the created body and mind, the field of the profane. The profane nature of the mind continually obscures and conceals the Enlightened Con-sciousness, the divine, Innate. The task of the yogi is to become aware of and directly experience the Enlightened Consciousness. This task is achieved by utilizing the breath, the energy of the limited Enlightened Consciousness, the libido and the reflections of our progenitors procrea-tive essences, the causal concealed essences, hidden in the body. The components of the limited Enlightened Consciousness, the life generating male and female essences, the two design carriers necessary for the fulfilment of the bio-genetic plan, are unified and obscured at the conception moment. However, this male/female axis is again separated by the division of the first cell which was formed at the radiant conception moment. The causal activity of the transformed reflections of the malet female duo can be noted by the build-up of the body and later by the various arisings of emotions and reaction patterns, the inherited traits, which color the personality. The marks or reflections of the basic"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxvi The Concealed Essence ofthe Hevajra Tantra essences of life, the polarity points which are biologically essential for the development of the body, are the locations of the deities manc;lalas found in the fully fonned body. These locations or abodes are the causal sources for the emotional natures and the reaction patterns of arislng which were se.aled into the potential personality by the bonding of the bio-genetic essences. It is in this manner that the two manc;lalas of the deities, the concealed essences, are seen as the causal sources of the relative, limited mind. These concealed essences are hidden in all bodies. The concealed essences are the tools which the yogi utilizes in .the Process of Generation and the other Processes. During gestation the causal activity of the manc;lalas is commenced by way of the genetically inherited traits. Upon birth these traits are solidified by the early patterns of breath fonned by· the interplay and experience of sensory stimulus. We unconsciously and consciously reflect upon our experiences by way of the stimulation of body chemis-try through the glands and the digestive system and thereby fonn responses and patterns of breathing to the various stimulations. Basic responses to sensory stimulus have already commenced in the gestation period by the play of genetically inherited traits. These traits are activated during that time by the partially active senses. From birth these responses are continued and built upon by way of the experiences of all the senses, their objects, the body chemistry and by the breathing patterns which are so caused. By this process of cause and effect the conception of a solid notion of personality is gradually fonned. In this manner the manc;lalas of the deities are the original sources of the causal activity of the genetically inherited traits. In tum the effect of the interplay of these traits with the senses and the sut;>sequent reactions and responses go on to create the fully fanned personality. Our ignorance of the intrinsic nature, our conception-right, and our belief in a solidified personal identity stems from not understanding the non~substantiality of the sensory faculties, the sensory objects, the mind and its thoughts. This misunderstanding is caused by our identification with the unpurified manifestations of the causal mal).c;lalas. This misunderstanding is further compounded by the limited understanding of existen~e which is instilled in us by being educated into nonns of any social system. Therefore, the deity antidotes are given by the master in order to purifying the causal manc;lalas, the obscured concealed essences, only after carefully assess-ing the disciple's personality, that is, in accordance with the manifesta-tions of the disciple's personality."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Introduction xxvii Regarding the bio-genetic view of the deities it is stated in the root treatise that: The fonn of the deity with which the yogi identifies exists only as something.whichis born, being a repository of the anns, faces arid colors which moreover arise in accordance with unrefined past tenden-cies (2. 2.45). Further, in Ratnakara8anti 's Muktaval.i commentary on the eighth chapter of the first part of the Hevajra Tantra (1.8.2), regarding the bio-genetic view of the deities, it is said that the deities are the father and mother of the emanator. What is the basis for the transformation technique applied by utilizing the concealed essences in the Process of Generation? The limited, relative, existen.ce is said to be impermanent, transitory and unsatisfactory in nature. Men and women as well as nations, civiliza-tions, worlds, solar systems and even galaxies must rise and fall. The only thing which is not capable of being consumed by time is the void. The Bhagavan defines the void as follows: \"The Void which is the finn essence, indestructible, indepletable, indivisible and not capable ofbeing consumed is called Vajra, the adamantine.\" In view of this kind of reasoning the awareness and reliance on voidness must be cultivated as the view of the nature of existence and of phenomenal things. However, it must be noted that this view is of the radiant, vibrant, liberating experience of voidness and not the intellectual nihilism so often attri-buted to this conception by nineteenth century scholars. This view of the adamantine is the Wisdom view. This Wisdom view is the basis for the technique of transformation which is applied by means of the concealed essences in the Process of Generation. The Wisdom view of transformation is defined in the root treatise as follows: \"The first among these techniques is one method, the method of generating the Heruka, for it is by utilizing the existent itself that me~ are liberated, 0' Vajragarbha of great mercy. Men are bound by the bondage of existence and are liberated by understanding the nature of existence. 0' wise one, existence should be conceived through the understanding of non-existence and likewise the Heruka should also be conceived through the understanding of non-existence.\" ( 1. 1. 10-11) The unique view oftransfonnation is further exemplified in the root treatise as follows: \"Beings are released from the bondage of existence utilizing as Means those very things by which beings, because of their wicked deeds, are bound. Beings are bound by passion and are released by utilizing passion. Such a conception of counteraction is not known to the followers of other Buddnist and non-Buddhist schools.\" (2. 2. 50-51) How is the transformation of the unrefined nature to be achieved?"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xxviii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra The first prerequisite for transfonnation is indicated in the first of the above quoted Wlits by the phrase '0 Vajragarbha of great mercy'. This indicates the generation of com passion. Therefore, the transfonnation of the unrefined nature is achieved by the application of Voidness, Wisdom and Compassion, Means. The.actual stages of practice the Process of Generation and the other processes can only be properly explained and practiced after the appropriate initiation and instruction is given by the guru. How is the view of the True Principle of Wisdom to be cultivated in regard to the experience Qf the phenomenal? Regarding the totality of sensory experience it is said in the root treatise: \"By their very nature, there is neither the fonn nor the one who sees, neither the sound nor the listener, neither the smell nor the one who smells, neither the taste nor the taster, neither the touch north~ one who touches and there is neither mind nor thought.\" (1. 5.1) What is meant by this very terse unit? The commentator states that fonn refers to blue, yellow and other attributes of fonns. He continues that all these fonns do not exist. This is so for all the other objects of sensory experience. Yet, then how is that the non-existent is still visible etc. These objects and sense faculties do not exist because of their very nature. In tenns of the intrinsic nature which is uncreated, transcendent, independent, and self-contained, fonns do not exist because they arise, that is, originate from dependent causation (prautyasamutpada). As these phenomenal fonns are dependent on previous causes that would demon-strate the non-substantiality of phenomenal things. This is the basis of the Wisdom view which must be cultivated in order to COJrectly apply the Process of Generation, the method of purifying the various emotional natures. This view is conceived fro~ the point of view of the True Principle of existence, the Absolute Voidness, the Innate Nature. However this is only the initial process of the method. The use of concealed essences in the Processes of Completion and Perfection will be demonstrated in the following paragraphs. Previously it has been shown that evarp. is a prime concealed essence capable of symbolizing and indicating the method applied in order to reveal and actualize the Innate state. It should be noted that the letter e and the syllable varp. are also synonyms for the principal seed syllables of the respective female, lunar, Mother Mandala and male, solar, Father Mandala. Now the complete inner union from the view-point of the Processes of Completion and Perfection will be described. Regarding the concealed essence evarp. and its application it is said in the root treatise: \"The"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Introduction xxix Concealed Essence of all the Buddhas abides in evaiJI.. EvaiJI. is the Great Bliss which is fully known through Consecration. \"(2.3.2). Why this is so is explained by: 'The divine letter e, adorned with the syllable· VaiJl placed within it, is the abode of all Bliss and the receptacle of all the jewels of the Enlightened Ones.\" (2.3.4). Describing how this occurs it is said: .. It is. there that the Joys arise distinguished by the different Moments. From the experience of these Moments the knowledge of the bliss located in evaiJI. is known.\"(2.3.5). How it is possible to know evaiJl is said by: 'The yogis know that evaip. is attainable through the four Moments .... \" (2.3.6). The unique significance of the Concealed Essence evaiP has been indicated. In terms of yoga what occurs when the syllable VaiJI. is placed in the letter e and forms the evaiJJ., jn the secret place, the Lotus, will be described. In the commentary it is said: '' . .. when those two seed-syllables become one aggregate in the form of a drop within the channel of the vajra gem which is situated in the navel, the Great bliss-filled· Fire of Passion blazes. This fire bums the Five Buddhas who are the Aggregate of the Five Components of Phenomenal Awareness, ·Locana and the others who are the earth element etc., as well as HaiJI.. Then from the center of Great Bliss flows the Moon.\" Again it is said: ..... the differentiated sensory experiences of the eyes etc., the Five Buddhas in their entirety, th~ five elements and the ego are all burnt and the Moon activates the Essential nature .... This great bliss-filled Fire of Great Passion is known as CaiJ.c;lal.I.\" In the Process of Perfection the letter e is the Bhaga, and designated as being the secret place, the Lotus, the female sexual organ, which is the source and is called Sukhavau, the Citadel of Bliss. The syllable VaiJl is the male sexual organ, and is known as the Vajra. In the complete inner union the Vajra is placed in the Lotus. This Vajra, known as the Gem, meaning the adamantine gem, is referred to in the famous Bodhisattva mantra, om maQi padme hurp. This mantra is translated as om [adaman-tine] Gem [of voidness] within the Lotus bUrp. The seed-syllable hOm indicates the enlightened consciousness which is said to be what is emanated in the Process of Perfection. This mantra is a way of recalling to mind the view and the actualization ofEvarp method in the Process of Perfection. In order to completely and clearly define the view of the method of generating the Enlightened Consciousness, the Innate natu·re, the Hevajra Tantra 2. 4. 32-35 is quoted."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra Vajragarbha asked: \"By what means should the Enlightened Con-sciousness be generated?\" The Bhagavan replied: \"The Enlightened Consciousness, which has absolute and relative fonns, should be generated by means of the MaiJoalaCircle etc. and by the process of Self-empowerment. As relative white like jasmine, as absolute essentially blissful, the Enlightened Con-sciousness should be generated in the female Lotus which is Sukhavau, the Citadel of Bliss, by forming the evam. Sukhavau, the Citadel of Bliss, is so called because it protects the bliss and is the resting place of the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Vajradharas.\" It has been shown that the secret abode of all the Buddhas is Sukhavau, the Citadel of Bliss. When the letter e is adorned with the . ( syllable vam it forms Evam and Bliss arises. That is, in terms of the stages of the Consecration, when the Vajra is placed in the secret place, the Lotus, the Joys .that arise in evam are distinguished by way of the Moments and from the experience of the Moments the knowledge of the bliss located in the evam is known. It is through Consecration that the Joys known by marking the Moments are first experienced. In the Hevajra Tantra the initial initiating experience of the Joys (ananda) by way of the marking of the Moments (ksaiJa) was gained by means of the consort practice. In this respect the methods found in the Hevajra Tantra indicate that they are for those inclined to great passion and emotion. In the classic tantric period the four Joys of the four stages of consecration were initially introduced and explained by the Erotic Metaphor of Union and then indicated by the refined procreative drama of the physical union of the master and the consort (the Means and the Wisdom) and finally fuily actualized by the union of the disciple with the Wisdom consort. Today, consecration is generally given only by means of the Erotic Metaphor of Union. It is stated in the commentary that a speciality of the Wisdom and Means method is that it can be practiced with or without an external consort. This means that initially the yogi and the yogiru could experi-ence the Moments and the Joys by utilizing the refined procreative drama, the method of the consort practice. Later, when they were established in the method, the yogi and the yogim could realize and experience the Moments and the Joys, alone. Even today, it is recognized that the Wisdom Consort is an initially necessary part of the tantric method in order that the realizations of the third and fourth consecrations can be achieved."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxi Regarding the physical, refined procreative drama in the root treatise it is said: ''Taking such a consort, having finn confidence in himself, the yogi should perfonn the Application of the Vow. This Application of the Vow which is said to be of a terrifying nature is not instructed for the sake of enjoyment, but for the examination of one's thoughts in order to ascertain if the mind is steady or wavering.\" (2. 1. 21) In the system of the Mahasiddhas men and women are said to epitomize basic qualities, namely compassion and voidness. In relative, social tenns the metaphors for these qualities can be described in women, as the selfless caring of a mother for her child; and in men, as the wish to protect or provide forthe mother and child. In the code language of the yogiS Voidness and Compassion are known as Wisdom and Means and therefore the method is epitomized by the union of Wisdom and Means. Wisdom and Means are prime Concealed Essences. These qualities of Voidness and Compassion are said to be the natures of the two concealed essences, the purified mai)c;ialas, the abodes of the deities, which reside within both men and women. In tenns of religious thought, the unique biogenetic view of the Mahasiddhas perceived that within men and women there resides a special force which could be used for spiritual development. This force is the procreative vibrancy of the semen and the ova. At that time both were known as semen (sukra). They saw that the refined, internal harnessing of the vibrant energy of semen was the relative or limited aspect of the Enlightened Consciousness. The refined internal expression of semen, the limited Enlightened Consciousness, is the culmination of the Process of Generation. This is expressed by the generated fonn of the wisdom deity which renders non-substantial the manifestations J the personality. In the Process of Perfection, by the refined utilization of the generated fonns, the absolute nature of the Enlightened Consciousness in tenns of the Great Bliss, can be revealed and actualized. In this manner it is said that the Bhagavan is of the nature of semen (sukra) and that Bliss is the beloved. Previously the procreative drama has been mentioneq. What is meant by the procreative drama, the refined procreative drama and the erotic metaphor? How are they significant in the tantric scheme? The ordinary procreative drama is the first, external, kind of yoga or union. Why procreative drama? In the act of pr_ocreation each partner has their own procreative quintessence and their own state of mind. These quintessences have influence upon and genetically channel the basic physical fonn and emotional natures of a conceived embryo. We have all"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xxxii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra seen physical traits and character traits in children which are similar to those in a particular parent These physical and mental traits are the given parts of the principles in the procreative drama. The physical union, when fully consummated, leads to the union of the quintessences of man and woman from which a live embryo is conceived and in due time a baby is born. The bio-genetic purpose of the procreative quintessences is fulfilled at conception. Until their complete union the procreative quintessences are the dual, unfulfilled, potentialities oflife. This union, at the conception point, is a dramatic event in that the genetic codes for determining the bodily form and the emotional traits which make up the personality are set in motion at that time. The union of the two quintessences is also a uniquely dramatic event because the nature of the mingling of the procreative essences oflife is the entry into the unlimited Enlightened Consciousness, the Innate. This unlimited En-lightened Consciousness is the underlying factor, the concealed essence, which marks all existence. Regarding the Innate it is said ~n the Hevajra Tantra: \"It is all-pervading and abides in all living bodies. It is truly the Great Life-breath and the World-pervader.\" (1.10.9-1 0). It is also said: \"The Innate is known as that which manifests in simultaneous arising. The essential nature is known as the Innate and is the one Concealed Essence of all things.\" (1.10.40). The refined procreative drama represents the reversal of the factors which obscure the infmite Innate nature. By means of the refined procreative drama the yogi and the yogiru are able to harness the concealed essences and th~ energy of the libido and direct them to reveal the primordial source. By understanding what occurs at the conception point of the biological procreative union they are able to directly analysis and experience the nature of existence and non-existence. They are able to reveal and actualize the Enlightened Consciousness and by this direct personal experience the limited personality is fully resolved into the Innate nature. Regarding the experience of existence and non-existence it is said: \"I am existence as well as non-existence; I am the enlightened one for I am enlightened regarding the true nature of things ... \"(2. 2.37). After conception the Enlightened Consciousness is obscured during the formation of the body and the mind. However, the generated body bears the reflections or marks of the male and female quintessences in the form of obscured maQdalas. These potential concealed essences which, when purified by the Process of Generation, are utilized in the outer union of the yogi and the yogiru as the basis for their mutual, inner union. The"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii fruit of this union is realized by the experience of the Joys through marking the Moments. The participants in this refined p'rocreative drama are seeking to directly reveal and actually experience the primordial Enlightened Consciousness which is present at the time of conception and which is normally not known in daily life. Strange as it may seem this method is similar in result to death where the resolution of the body and mind into the Enlightened Consciousness initially occurs. Here however, the obscuring nature of the personality is consciously resolved, killed so to speak, by the application of the Processes of the Wisdom and Means method. In the Hevajra tradition the refined procreative drama is an int~gral part of the method of the Processes of Completion and Perfection. The complete union of the deities, theirnatures, maJJ.dalas and seed-syllables within the yogi and the yogiru are effected in the manner epitomized by evam during the refined procreative drama. During the refined procrea-tive drama the four Joys are directly experienced by marking the Moments: The limited expression of Enlightened Consciousness is known by marking of the first three Joys. The Innate Joy, the experience of the fully Enlightened Consciousness, is known by means of the Signless Moment. This is the physical refined procreative drama which was utilized in the rite of consecration found in the Hevajra Tantra. The external union of the male and female sexual organs and the mingling of their procreative quintessences and the fruit the child born out of the union of man and woman are the metaphor for describing the inner union. The fruit of this inner union is the uncreated Innate nature. This is the Erotic Metaphor of Union. Regarding the erotic metaphor it is stated in the root treatise that:\" .... The symbolism of the external union [of the two, the male and female sexual organs] indicates the nature of the secret union.\" (2. 4. 53) Hence the procreative drama, the refined procreative drama and the erotic metaphor. In India and later in Tibet large groups of monks existed side by side with tantric yogiS. Even in the classic tantric period in India friction existed between the monks and the yogiS as can be noted in the life stories of many of the Mahasiddhas. This type of friction was caused because the application of the tantric vows (cary a) by the yogis was at odds with the vows of the monks as laid down by the Vinaya. Therefore, many monks turned ·yogiS were forced out of the monasteries because they applied tantric precepts. In applying their tantric vows yogis ate meat and drank wine as parts of the sacrament. They also practiced with an external"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"xuiv The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra consort. By applying the tantric vows the yogiS broke the monastic injunctions against the butchering and eating of flesh and the imbibing of intoxicants as well as breaking the monk's vow of celibacy. It appears that there were two views regarding .the style of consecra-tion into the tantra. The two styles were the monastic style suited to the disciplines of the Mahayana monk and the radical style suited to the free-thinking, alchemist yogiS tired of or unsuited to the conformity and self-repression needed to live in the monastery. In Tibet many famous yogis started their training as monks but as they matured in the practice they often left the monasteries. They left in order to strictly apply their tantric precepts in an undistracted 'in character' manner by wandering and sometimes staying for long periods in mountain caves or lonely places to practice the method with or without their consorts. Because of this strict distinction between monk and yogi and their appropriate set of vows, it appears that the method of consecration into the tantra was different for each of them. The style of consecration for the monk was probably given more in the manner found today which uses the Erotic Metaphor of Union. Whereas the consecration of the yogi was, as previously stated, by means of the physical, refined procreative drama. There are two other differences in the method of giving consecration between the past and present times. Firstly, it was much harder pre-viously to obtain consecration and even when consecration was obtained it was generally given in separate parts, a further part only being given when the disciple was deemed ready. The second difference was that consecration was not generally given en mass or to large assemblies, as is often the case today. Previously only invited aspirants could attend the consecration rite. The rite of consecration was deemed crucial because it directly indicates of the stages of revedal, refinement, union and actualization which lead to full enlightenment. The master performed the rite to coherently demonstrate the stages to full enlightenment in order that his ripened disciples, by means of the direct physical method, could intuitively realize their own conception-right, the Enlightened Consciousness. The observance of the Concealed Essences is said to be the Abhiseka, the Consecration. Consecration is said to be four-fold for the benefit of living beings. The four parts of the Consecration are said to be the Master (acarya), the Secret (guhya), the Wisdom (prajfUi) and after that the Fourth(caturtham). The four stages of consecration are said to give knowledge of the four Anand as, the four Joys. This knowledge of the four Joys is known in the four consecrations by marking the four KsaQ.as, the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Introduction XXXV four Moments. The Joys ~d the Moments are initially known through consecration. There are four Joys, the Ordinary Joy (ananda), the Refined Joy (paramananda), the Joy of Cessation (viramananda) and the Innate Joy (sahajananda). There are also four Moments, the Diverse (vicitra) Moment, the Ripening (vipaka) Moment, the Dissolving (vimarda) Moment and the Signless (vilaksai)a) Moment. The understanding of the Moments is crucial and they cart only be known through Consecration. It is therefore said that the four Joys and the four Moments are related with the four-fold division of consecration. In this· way the Diverse Moment corresponds to the Ordinary Joy and the Master consecration. The Ripening Moment to the Refined Joy and the Secret consecration. The Dissolving Moment to the Joy of Cessation and the Wisdom consecration. The Signless Moment to the Innate Joy and the Fourth consecration. Therefore it is said that in each consecration one of the four Joys and one of the four Moments must be experienced. The Joy and the Moment appropriate to a particular consecration is to be under-stood-as the conclusive proof of the accomplishment of that consecration. Now the four-fold consecration of the tantric tradition will be described. Prior to consecration rite the disciple begs the guru for consecration in the following manner: \"0 Bhagavan, great Tranquil One who is intent only on the Vajra union, perfecter of the Seals who originates from the union of the indivisible Vajras! 0 great Being, as you do for yourself, 0 Lord, may you also do the same for me. I am sunk in the thick mud of phenomenal existence, save me who has no other resort.\" (2. 3. 18-19). Within the cycle of the Hevajra Tantra the master is the one who leads the aspirant far away from unmeritorious natures. This is said to be his observance of the Concealed Essence and is said to be the essence of the Master Consecration. The Master consecration is said to be divided into five parts and is known in other tantras, such as the Caooamaharoslll)a Tantra, as the Five-fold Consecration. There are different five part consecrations for men and women, that is, for the Means and for the Wisdom. In order to actualise of the Master 9onsecration to those of weak sensibility, instruction upon the Seal of Ritual (karmamudra) is given. The Master Consecration is known as the introduction to the nature of the four Moments and the four Joys. After that, in accordance with the degree of the sensibility of the disciple the Master, Secret, Wisdom and Fourth marked by the Moments are to be known. When giving the other"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":".xxxvi The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra parts of the consecration the guru commences the rite with the Master consecration. In the Secret consecration the disciple first honors the guru with clothes and other offerings. Then he presents to the guru a graceful and youthful consort. After that the disciple is either blindfolded or leaves the room and the guru worships himself with fish, meat etc., and serves these to the consort and then unites \\\\i,th her. The red and white fluid which arises from this union is placed in a receptacle. The disciple is called back and the guru introduces the disciple to the Flavour of Essential Similar-ity (samarasa) by dropping or by writing seed syllables on his tongue with the fluid. Then the guru says: *'Today I have generated for you the knowledge of a Buddha by means of which the Buddha Lords of the past, present and future attain their Unrestricted Essence of Release\" (Canoamaharosana Tantra Ch. 3, translated by G. W .Farrow and !.Menon). The disciple vows, on dire consequences, not to reveal the manoala to the uninitiated and is then blindfolded and throws a flower into the manoala. The blindfold is removed and the manoala shown to the disciple. The sign of where the flower has landed as we'll as the full significance of the manoala is explained to the disciple. From the view of the Process of Perfection, the guru's instructions revealing the four Joys which are of the nature of the four Moments when the Vajra Gem is placed in the secret place, the Lotus, is the Secret Consecration. It is said to be secret because it cannot be explained to the yogi in terms of phenomenal concepts. In this Secret Consecration, in-struction upon the emanation of the Seal of the Sacrament (sama-·yamudra) is given for those of medium sensibility. This is the modus operandi of the Secret Consecration. At the stage of the Wisdom consecration the guru offers the Wisdom consort to the disciple saying: \"0' great Being, take this consort who will give you bliss.\" (2:3.15) Or, as in the Canoamaharosaoa Tantra, he says: \"Serve this beautiful vessel of your delight as instructed by the Buddhas.\" (CanoamaharosanaTantraCh.3,translatedby G.W.Farrowandi.Menon). The disciple is warned that by not following the rules he will not attain the Accomplishment Then the guru instructs regarding the division of the four Joys. After that the guru commands the disciple saying: \"0' bearer of the Vajra perform the Union!\" ( 2. 3. 16). The guru then leaves. Then the Wisdom consort becomes naked and squatting points with her index finger to her secret place. She tests the yogi's determination with acts that are considered socially repugnant. She should say: \"Ah! my Lotus contains all pleasures. I grant accomplishment to the one who"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Introduction x.xxvii serves my Lotus in accordance with 'the instructions. Within the Lotus, with a concentrated mind, perform what is appropriate .... Here indeed is located the Great Bliss.\"( CaiJ.oamaharosaQ.a Tantra Ch. 3, translated by G.W.Farrow and !.Menon). The disciple should imagine himself as having the form of the principal male deity and the consort should imagine herself as having the form of the principal female deity. They should then unite and mark the four Joys. From the view of the Process ofPerfection, with the Vajra Gem placed in the secret place, the Lotus, the Wisdom Consecration is explained. Wisdom is the excellent knowledge that all things are merely the creations of one's own mind. The consecra-tion for bestowing that knowledge is the Wisdom Consecration. It is said that this knowledge is the ma~king of the Moments, in accordance with the guru's instructions, by means of that Gem. The Gem is the confluence of the three nac;l.Is the nature of which are the three kinds of consciousness, imaginarf: dependent and fully manifested. It is said that this Knowledge of Wisdom must be experienced together with an external consort. For those of strong sensibility who have been consecrated in this Wisdom Consecration, instruction is given upon the Seal of Essential Nature (dharmamudra), which is th~ Stabilized Meditative State of the Dream-like (mayopamasamadhi). Similarly 'after that the fourth thus'. It is said that 'Thus' is synony-mous with Thusness, the Absolute Void and the Essence of Nature. The consecration which. reveals and instructs upon this Thusness must be given directly after the Wisdom Consecration. The Fourth Consecration is experienced with the external consort and is based, in accordance with guru's instructions, upon a practice which is not dependent upon any-thing (analaiJlbanayoga) and is pervaded with the Signless Moment where it is not possible to determine any definite place of origination. Regarding the nature of the fourth consecration it is said: \"The nature of the Mahamudra accomplishment is such that it cannot be unintention-ally experienced by anyone.\" After marking the four Joys and completing the union the disciple should present himself to the guru. The guru will exhort the disciple saying:\"O great Being, hold the Great Bliss! 0 bearerofthe Vajra, until the attainment of enlightenment act for the benefit of beings!\" (2. 3. 21). Then the disciple should offer a feast comprising intoxicants, meats etc., to the guru and the gathered Circle of Initiates (gai)acakra). The attainment of the Innate Joy is known by marking the Signless Moment at the end of the Refined Joy and at the beginning of the Joy of Cessation. This is explained in the root treatise and commentary as"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"xxxviii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra follows: \"My nature is that of Innate Joy which is [known) at the end of the Refined Joy and at the beginning of the Joy of Cessation.\" (2. 1. 40). This means that the Innate nature must be marked by the appropriate observation at the beginning of the Joy of Cessation. The Signless characteristic is said to be the appropriate observation and because of this characteristic the Innate Joy is said to be different from and devoid of the three other Joys. In this way the Innate nature and the means to the Innate nature have been described in tenns of the Consecrations, Joys and Moments. The Carya, the Application of the Vow is said to be the strict application of vows according to the instructions of the gurus and Buddhas. That is, the instructiOI)S given by the master to the disciple in order that the stages of the consecration can be realized and stabilized. It is also said that whether there is accomplishment (siddhi) or not in this life, definitive clarity for attaining the accomplishment is gained through the foundation of the Application of the Vow. In the commentary it is said that there are four types of practitioners, who are of the mild, medium, strong and strongest sensibilities. No Application of the Vow is mentioned for a person of the strongest sensibility, for at the time of their gaining the Fourth Consecration the Application of the Vow is realized through the Mahamudra. Enlighten-mentis said to be quickly attained by the Application of the Vow. For the disciples of mild, medium and strong sensibilities, the Application of the Vow is said to be of three kinds. These three are the Differentiated, the Undifferentiated and the Extremely Undifferentiated Applications of the Yow. It has been shown that a tantric system of language is utilized in the composition of tantric treatises. However, there is a language code and cipher to be found in the Hevajra Tantra and the commentary the Yogaratnamala. This is the Sandhyabhasa, the Tantric Code Language. The tantric code language is the language of direct communication of intended meaning by means of coded fonnulas between the guru and the disciple. This is the direct, vocal, method of communicating with the guru and the other initiates at the Assembly of the Circle of Initiates and at other times. However there is also another mode of secret communication, that of the Choma, the Secret Sign Language signaled during the Ga.I)acakra, the Assembly of the Circle of Initiates and at other gatherings. These meetings were held at night, in lonely gathering places such as Plthas or other assembly grounds near appropriate temple sites. The feasts were"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxix offered at the time of consecration and on appropriate dates in the lunar calendar. At these gatherings the Songs and the Dances were also offered. The Songs and the Dances will be described shortly. Regarding the Secret Sign Language it is said by the commentator that according to the convention of the yogirus, the secret hand sign language is the accepted mode of communication when meeting the yogirus. This must be known since it is a supreme Means. This non-vocal form of communication was used by the yogiS to greet and converse with the yogirus during the mostly silent drama of enlightened consciqus-ness mimed at the Assembly of the Circle of Initiates. The drama was signaled in terms of the tantric method, where realizations were ex-pressed by sign, as were the basis for further instructions. It was also a method by which the master could reveal his nature to the disciple at the gathering. This kind of communication was deemed necessary because the very nature of the states being described are beyond the realm of phenomenal concepts. At such gatherings, before and after the empow-ering rite and during and after the feasting, the need to communicate was curtailed to only the essential matters at hand and these were expressed in secret sign language. The need to directly perceive or experience the method was given greater priority than sermons etc. It was felt that words and concepts '\\\"Ould only confuse the unripened disciples and hinder their concentration upon the essentials of the method during such gatherings. Such gatherings were a means to introduce novices to the matured realizations of the adepts and thereby deepen their own level of direct personal experience. The secret code language was for the direct, oral, transmission of instructions from the guru to the disciple. At the Assembly of the Circle oflnitiates only the highest adepts vo-calized their realizations in a song or verse form, hence the carya songs of the Mahasiddhas and the Tibetan masters. The Cary a songs of these Masters sh<;>uld be considered as pith instructions regarding the theory, practice and experience of the tantric method. In order to try to convey the mood of the Assembly of the Circle of Initiates and also to exemplify the modes of secret communication five units of a song are now quoted: \"0! the Bola is located at Kollagiri, the Kakko~a at MunmUI).i. The hand-drum is sounded forcefully; Compassion is affected, not discord. Here we eat meat and drink liquor in large quantities. Hey! Here the worthy ones enter, the unworthy ones are barred. We bring faeces, urine, menstrual blood and semen. Here we eat herbs and human flesh with relish. We move to and fro without consideration of pure or impure."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"xL The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra Adorning our limbs with bone-ornaments, here we enter the corpse. In the meeting we perform the sexual union; the untouchable is not rejected here.\" (2. 4. 6-10). In these units the tantric view of the method is fully explained by means of coded language. The commentary gives the cipher which indicates the attitude and ingredients for the erotic union to be completed during the gathering of Initiates. Now the commentary on these units by KrsiJacaryapada. In Kollagiri, that is, in the head, is the seed-syllable haQl which is the Bola [the male sexual organ, the Vajra]. In Mummuni, that is, in the navel, is the seed-syllable aQ1 which is the Kakkola [ the female sexual organ, the Lotus]. From the union of these two seed-syllables, uninter-ruptedly the hand-drum, meaning, the unstruck sound (anahatadhvani) resounds. Compassion is generated by the yogi. 'He does not create dis-cord' means he does not stir up gross erotic play. 'He eats meat' means he consumes the notion of a self, that is, he makes it non-substantial. 'He drinks liquor' means he drinks the nectar of Great Bliss arising from the union. 'The worthy ones enter' means that the breath enters within. 'Unworthy ones' refer to passion and other molestations [which are rejected]. 'Faeces' refers to the Form component of the Aggregate of Phenomenal Awareness, 'urine' to the Sensation component, 'menstrual blood' to the Conceptualisation component and 'semen' to the compo-nent of Phenomenal Awareness. 'We bring' means they are cleansed. The component of the Imprint of Past Actions is what is intended by 'herbs'. 'Human flesh' refers to the identification of all these components with a self. Here 'we eat' means, there in that [erotic] union they are rendered non-substantial. In the phrase 'move to and fro', 'move to' refers to the arising of the seminal fluid from the experience of Great Bliss; 'and fro' refers to its return. 'Without consideration of pure and impure' means that existence and non-existence are not distinguished. 'Bone-ornaments', known in the Tantric Code Language as NiraQlsuka, naked, refer to the drops of semen because they are the bare essence. The 'adorning of the limbs' refers to the pervading [of the semen as enlight-ened consciousness] through every part of the body by way of the nac;iis. 'Here' means in this union. The 'corpse' represents the non-existence of a self in all natures. 'Enters' means enters into that state. 'Meeting' refers to the union of the nac;iis. 'Untouchable' refers to the stabilized meditative state where all things are non-existent. 'Not rejected' means is made apparent to oneself."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction xLi Any conversations during the feast at the Assembly of the Circle of Initiates would be couched in the terms similarto those described in these units. When spoken with the intended meaning, as deciphered by the commentator, these conversations would be powerful tools to instruct disciples on the processes of the method. Now the Dance and Song will be discussed. It is said that Dance which is the performance of emanation must be performed with uninter-rupted attention, an impassioned mind, and with the postures of the deities which serve to indicate their natures. Songs may be sung at the same time and also at a later time. These songs, couched in code, should express the Means to the supreme. The Dance is said to be the emanation and the Song the recitation of mantra. With the Dance the disciples can become familiar with the forms of the deities to be emanated. With the Songs the whole assembly is protected and the inimical forces subdued. In this manner the whole assembly is empowered by the Dance and the Song during the Assembly of the Circle oflnitiates. At the time when the Dances and Songs are completed it is said that the chosen leader of the assembly must take note of the signs. Therefore by means of this empowering feast the theories, practices and experiences of the Processes are taught and directly experienced. This is the celebration of. the 'In Character Yogi'. In this manner the Hevajra Tantra describes the Tantric Code Language, the Secret Sign Language, the Dance and the Song. Now in order to complete this introduction to the Hevajra Tantra and the Yogaratnamala the means to and the nature of the realization of the Innate will be discussed. Regarding the realization of the Innate nature it is said that the actual realization of this culminating state cannot be explained by another, not even by the guru or the Vajradhara. That is, the Innate nature must be intuitively known through ones' own direct personal experience. This direct personal experience (svasamvedyam) is gained as a result of the merit accrued by diligently following the Means, the guru's instructions. The emanation of the Innate is performed by pervading the whole universe and not just a limited sphere. In the light of the direcr personal experience of the True Principle of Wisdom all manifestations are viewed as equal. Regarding this the Bhagavan states: \"Whatever exists, whether fixed or moving are all in truth Me ... \" ( 1.8.37). In this manner when the True Principle, the Innate, is realized, everything is directly understood in terms of Samaras a, the Flavour of Essential Similarity. Therefore whatever exists is conceived as being of the same supreme"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"xLii The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra principle directly experienced by the yogi. The supreme principle, the Enlightened Consciousness is the conception-right of all beings. From the union of evaiJl in the secret place, the Lotus, the Citadel of Bliss, the knowledge that arises from the Dharmodaya, the Source of Nature, is said to be space-like and also consisting of Means. Here, in the Process of Perfection the Means are said to be the emanation of the Innate. Therefore the direct personal experience of the Innate is said to be the empowerment and this knowledge of the Innate is synonymous with the nature of the Bhagavan. It is said that at the moment when this knowledge of Great Bliss intuitively arises in the yogi the five elements do not restrain him and his mind knows the minds of others. His body is at one with the realms of the heavens, earth and the hells and the yogi is no longer afflicted by misconceptions which separate him from others. It is my hope this introduction to the compositional style and contents of the Hevajra Tantra and the Yogaratnamala will assist the reader to clearly perceive the refined and subtle tantric method of Wisdom and Means evolved and utilized in the Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism.

In both the root text and commentary the Hevajra Tantra is refered to as a Yogiru tantra. The commentator calls it a Niruttara tantra. It is evident that the Guhyasamaja Tantra and Sarvatathagatatattvasrupgraha which belong to the Yoga class oftantras have influenced the Hevajra Tantra. In the Hevajra Tantra (2.5.67) there is couplet in an Apabhrrupsa dialect describing the characteristic of the Innate. This couplet is found in one of the songs of the Mahasiddha Saraha. If the Hevajra Tantra is quoting the words of Saraha it would imply that the Hevajra Tantra was composed during or after Saraha's time. We think that it was composed between the 8th and 9th century A.D., somewhere in the region of modem day Bengal, Orissa or Bihar. There is good reason to believe that the KrsiJacarya who has written the Yogaratnamala commentary is the same person whose songs under the name ofKlU)ha and KrsiJapaiJdita are found in the collections ofBuddhist Carya songs. The tantric yoga techniques described in the Hevajra Tantra have their origins in an orally transmitted tradition which antedates the written tradition by at least a few centuries. Concepts and practices from various religious and social contexts are found in the Vajrayana, known as Mantrayana in Buddhisttant.ric literature. The Vajrayana tradition adopted and refined relevant elements from the ascetic yoga traditions, the rituals of tribal shamans, the fertility and passage rites, the rites of initiation into manhood, the rites of coronation of chieftains, ancestor worship, the worship of temple and family deities and the circuits of pilgrimage. Concepts found in the monastic traditions of both the Hmayana and the Mahayana were evolved and utilised to suit the Vajrayana method. The Hevajra Tantra als~ amplifies the views and methods ~ound in the Guhyasamaja Tantra and emphasizes the direct experience of the Innate (sahaja) and the Great Bliss (mahasukha) which characterise the Mahamudra Accomplishment. KrsiJacarya's commentary demonstrates that he was well-versed in the Abhidharma tradition and the Mahayana schools as well as the tantric view which originates from the Guhyasamaja Tantra.

It is worth noting that Heruka, a tenn used for the male deity in Buddhist tantras, is also a synonym for Siva. We examined Snellgrove's edition of the Hevajra Tantra and four manuscripts of the Hevajra Tantra from the National Archives in Kath-mandu, Nepal. While deciding between variant readings of the text of the Hevajra Tantra we gave preference, whenever it was available, to the version found in the Yogaratnmala.

I will amplify evarn in due course. ekasmin samaye (at one time): Means once, not at all times and everywhere. bhagavan: Refers to Vajradhar~ in the form ofHevajra. Bhagavan is the one who has Bh~ga, that is, Lordliness and the other auspicious qualities. It is said: ''The six qualities, Lordliness, Abundance, Grace, Excel-lence, Splendor and Meaningful Application of Knowledge, are called Bhaga.\" vijahara (dwelt): Bhagavan pleasurably dwelt within the abodes of the Buddha, the Enlightened One. Where ~xactly did Bhagavan dwell? sarvatathagatak.ayaviik.cittavajrayosidbhagesu (in the wombs of the Vajra Lady-which are the Body, Speech and Mind of all the Buddhas): Bhagavan dwelt in the wombs of the Vajra Lady which are the Body, Speech and Mind of all the Buddhas. The Body, Speech and Mind are the Three Secret Centr~s (triguhyasarnhara). These three centres constitute the form ofBhagavan Vajradhara which is known as the Source ofNature (dhannodaya). These Secret Centres are the wombs of the adamantine goddesses, Locana and the others. The Three Secret Centres are wombs of the adamantine goddesses because their bodies are in essence faultless and possess infinite pure natures. The Body, Speech and Mind of all the Buddhas are synonymous with the wombs of these adamantine god-desses is the intent. The Bhagavan, together with his retinue, having obtained residence within the wombs, tranquilly passed his time there in the inner chamt?er which is the most secret of secret places. Previous tantras have also in-dicated this to be so. Further explanations are unnecessary here. This is the interpretation literally inferred. [Another interpretation of] evarn maya srutam: \"E is Bhaga (the female sexual organ), vam. is KuliSa (the male sexual organ), maya is the activation and srutam, what was heard, is said to be two-fold.'\" It is said: \"Bhagavan is of the nature of Semen; that Bliss is the Beloved.\" It is also said: \"Vajradhara is characterized by the qualities of Essential Nature (dhanna) and Enjoyment (sarnbhoga).\""},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Vajra Family 5 And again: \"As relative, white like jasmine; as absolute, essentially blissful.\" By such statements the essential tantric view regarding the nature of Voidness (sOnyata) and Compassion (karuQa), Wisdom (prajfia) and Means (upaya), the Body of Essential Nature (dharmakaya) and the Body of Enjoyment (saiPbhogakaya), the Relative (saiPvrti) and the Absolute (paramartha) and the Process of Generation (utpattikrama) and the Process of Completion (utpannakrama) are expressed. Regarding this it is also said: \"He symbolizes Great Compassion, and vajra symbolizes Wisdom. Now listen to this tantra which I proclaim that is the essence of Wisdom and Means.\" This being so, 'at one time' etc., is clear. Some say this is the interpretation according to the lineage holders. And again this interpretation [of evaQl maya srutaiP]: \"E is known as the Earth element, the. Seal of the Ritual (karmamudra) and Locana. Locana is in a lotus of sixty-fou~ petals in the Centre of Creation (nirmiil)acakra) located in the navel. \"VaiJl is known as the Water element, the Seal of Essential Nature (dharmamudra) and Mamaki. Mamaki is in a lotus of eight petals in the Centre of Essential Nature (dharmacakra) located in the heart. \"Ma refers to the the Fire element, the Great Seal (mahamudra) and PaQc;lara. PaQc;lara is in a lotus of sixteen petals in the Centre of Enjoyment (saiPbhogacakra) located in the throat. \"Ya is said to be the Air element, the Seal of the Sacrament (sama-yamudra), and Tarii)l.

The Innate, as relative, is the form of the deity and is the view according to the Process of Generation (utpattikrama). The Innate, as absolute, is bliss and is the view according to the Process of Perfection (nispannakrama). The doctrinal instructions of the Buddhas are founded upon these two truths.\" Therefore later in this tantra it is said: \"The instructions of the Vajradhara are based upon the two processes, the Process of Generation and the Process of Completion\".

The different consecrations will be explained. With reference to consecration it will be said: \"In order that living beings may attain the Accomplish-ment consecration is proclaimed to be four-fold. Consecration is so called because one is sprinkled and cleansed.\" Regarding the fourfold division of consecration it is said: \" ... the Master (acarya), the Secret (guhya), the Wisdom (prajna) and after that the Fourth (caturtham) thus\" and other such statements. In this Yogin! tantra, the Master is the one who leads the aspirant far away from unmeritorious natures. That is his observance of the Con-cealed Essence and is the essential nature of the Master Consecration which is known as an introduction by means of the Seal of the Ritual (karmamudra) to the nature of the four Moments and the four Joys."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"18 The Concealed Essence of the Hevajra Tantra It is said that one is not consecrated by the Master Consecration merely by receiving the simple introductory consecrations of the Kriya and other tantras. It is wrong to say that by merely receiving these consecrations one is worthy of listening to. and interpreting the Yoga tantras, the Yogiru tantras and others. Thus, in order to become worthy to listen, reflect and meditate upon the Hevajra and other Yogin! tantras the Master Consecration is given first After that, according to the sensibility of the disciple, instruction should be given regarding the characteristics of the Master, Secret, Wisdom and Fourth Consecrations. In this sense, in order to make sure that the disciples of weak sensibility who have received the Master Consecration actualize [this first stage of practice] instruction upon the method of differentiated emanation by means of the Seal of the Ritual is given. In this manner, from the view-point of the Process of Perfection, the guru's instruction by placing his Gem [the Vajra] in the Secret Place [the Lotus] and the revealing of the four Joys which are of the nature of the four Moments is tl)e Secret Consecration. It is called 'secret' because it cannot be explained to the yogi in terms of phenomenal concepts. In this Secret Consecration, instruction regarding emanation with the Seal of the Sacrament (samayamudra) is given for those of medium sensibility. Similarly, the Wisdom Consecration. Wisdom is the excellent know-ledge that all things are merely the creations of one's own mind. The consecration for bestowing that knowledge is the consecration of the Knowledge of Wisdom. This knowledge is the marking of the Moments, in accordance with the guru's instructions, by means of that Gem which is the confluence of the three nadis, the nature of which. are the three kinds of consciousness, imaginary, dependent and fully manifested. This Knowledge of Wisdom must be experienced together with an external consort. For those of strong sensibility who have been consecrated in this Wisdom Consecration, instruction is given regarding the Stabilised Meditative State of the Dream-like (mayopamasamadhi) by means of the Seal of Essential Nature (dharmamudra). Similarly 'after that the Fourth thus'. Here 'that' refers to the Consecration of the Knowledge of Wisdom. Here 'thus' is synonymous with Thusness, the Absolute Void and the Essence·ofNature. The con-secration which reveals and instructs upon this Thusness, the Fourth Consecration, must be given 'after that', that is, after the Knowledge of Wisdom Consecration. This is the intent. The Fourth Consecration is"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Vajra Family 19 experienced with an external consort and is based, in accordance with the guru's instruction~. upon a technique of yoga which does not depend upon anything (analmp.banayoga) and is pervaded by the Signless Moment where it is not possible to determine any definite place of origi-nation. Again, the Fourth Consecration is not merely through the guru's instructions. OtheiWise, Bhagavan saying 'one is sprinkled and cleansed' (ref. 2.3.12) would mean only just the washing away of impurities. Then how can the experience of the Fourth Consecration occur t.lm>ugh in-structions? Also, why is it that when the.True Principle is explained the experience of the Fourth does not occur? This is a relevant point because the True Principle is beyond the range of someone else's verbal explana-tion. It is not possible to fully explain the True Principle and the listener cann,ot understand the True Principle [through explanations]. For it is said: \"The disciple does not really understand the principle that arises within the teacher, but from the sound [of the teacher's voice] there arise some notions regarding that principle. The disciple, with hundreds of his own notions, constructs an understanding of that prin-cipl~. What principle can be understood by one confused by notions!\" Surely, if consecration itself is the cause for the realization of the True Principle, all impurities will be destroyed. Then why is the Mahamudra Accomplishment not immediately attained when consecra-tion is given? The Mah~udra is attained only by those heroic [disciples] of strong sensibility whose determination is fully ripened. The nature of the Mahamudra Accomplishment is such that it cannot be unintentionally experienced by anyone. Therefore it has been said by Samayavajrapada: \"For the one who has, by utilising the Means of the Vajra method, purified his mind and fully manifested the direct personal experience of the Great Bliss of the body of Essential Nature, has attained skill and perfected the three Vajras, has completely severed the confu-sions of phenomenal existence by means of the realisation of the non-existence of self, knows the principle of his own purified mantra and is endowed with the proficiency of the Means, the accomplishment of the Vajradhara, in this very life, is in the palm of his hand.\" So it is like this: At the time of the Fourth Consecration those who happen to be initiates of extremely strong sensibility attain the Mahamudra Accomplishment. For the others further instruction upon the Mahamudra should be given."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"20 The Concealed Essence of the.Hevajra Tantra [Referto 1.1.27] caturaryasatyani (Four Noble Truths): In the four consecrations re-spectively, instructions are given on understanding the existence of sorrow, the origin of sorrow, the possibility of the cessation of sorrow and the way to end sorrow by utilising purified emanation.

For ignorant people they do indeed appear to exist. However, their existence is not proved by their mere appearance, for do not people see images of hairs, a double moon, the eyes upon a peacock's tail or flies. If they see these things because of their defective sight, then others in just the same way, w1th the eyes of their mind affected with the cataract of ignorance, see things which are essentially non-existent as though everything out there actually exists. It is similar to the illusory images of hairs seen by a man of defective sight. But it is not so with the Noble Ones, for the eyes of their minds see beyond the defects of ignorance. Thus the Bodhisattva Sarvavivaral).aviskambhi has praised Bhagavan saying: \"0 Lord, when you turned the Wheel of the Doctrine all things, which are by their very nature liberated, returned to their primordial tranquillity and non-arisen state.\" In this manner it is established that form and the rest, by their very nature are intrinsically non-existent. na drasta ityadi (the one who sees etc.): That which sees forms, that is, faculty of visual awareness does not exist because of the non-arising nature of all things.

This is the view from the Process of Completion. Thus the two-fold and four-fold division of the Innate has been explained. This is one interpretation. [Now another interpretation of 1.8.24-25] khadhatav ityadi ('In Space' etc.): 'In the Lotus' means in the four Seals (caturmudra) which are associated with Locana and the others. 'Knowledge' refers to the non-dual knowledge. 'Bhaga' is so called because of destroying (bhanjana) Kle8a and the other Maras. 'Emana-tion' is said to be the Attainment of the State of Unity. The Attainment of the State of Unity is achieved along with an external conson and is by means of uniting the Lotus and Vajra and by the simultaneous dropping of the seminal fluids [in orgasm]. 'Bliss' which is known as the 'Circle' refers to the bliss of the Attainmentofthe State of Unity. The intent is that among the Circles the bliss of the Attainment of the State of Unity is the Fourth. 'The order appropriate' means in the proper sequence of the processes. Regarding 'Direct Personal Experience': The bliss which is persanally experienced in accordance with the guru's instruction in the first Circle, in the Seal of the Ritual which characterises the Master Consecration, is called direct personal experience. That bliss which is generated in the Seal of Essential Nature is the Enlightened Conscious-ness. The bliss which is experienced in the Seal of the Sacrament is the bliss of the deity. The pure Great Bliss which is generated in the Great Seal (mahamudra) is the characteristic of that which manifests 'in the proper order of arising'. What arises in the proper order is the semen (suk.ra). The word 'sukra' is to be understood as being composed of 'su' which refers to the sorrows of phenomenal existence and 'kra' which refers to the severing of these sorrows with a saw. Regarding the two kinds of Innate: In the experiencing of the four types of Seals, two kinds oflnnate arise from the bliss. One is of the nature of Great Bliss and the second is of the nature of semen. The two-fold division of the Innate is thus described in terms of the division of the Seals, the Seal of the Ritual, the Seal of Essential Nature and so on, Is it only in the male that it arises? Certainly not! It is in both the male and the female. In order to demonstrate this it is said: yosit ityadi (the woman etc.). atraivapi (in this very context): The intent is that the four-fold division of Joy are the four types of Seals.

This is the second interpretation (of 1.8.26-28). All this must be understood from the instructions of the guru. Now as a totality the three aspects of relative Joy are mentioned: anandarn prathamarn vlrarJl paramanandarn yogini/ suratanandarn samastam tatsukhopayab sarvavit// (29) The first Joy is the Hero, the Refined Joy is the Yogiru and the erotic Joy is the totality.

Therefore, emanation is not useless for it is impossible to realise the Innate without the perfec-tion of emanation. Regarding this Bhagavan has said: \"You yourself must perform this method that I have instructed which severs the afflictions of desire.\" Surely this is an appropriate reasoning for the emanation of the MaJJdala Circle etc. But the Innate Joy must be experienced in actual terms. In that case, in the matter of something that has to be actually ex-perienced, someone else's instructions are not valid. So it is said: punyat (from merit): Consider it as follows: the Innate Joy is not attained in the phenomenal because the phenomenal world.is defiled by impurities. Then is this Innate, which is the intuitively experienced Body of Essential Nature of the Tathagatas, attainable here? As there is no other way here, the Innate is intuitively known only by oneself from the ripening of the practice of emanation by the actualisation of the instruc-tions on the phenomenal aspects of the Innate, and not before that ripening.
