Not only are the dates uncertain, but so too is almost everything about her. I will explore what there is to know and not to know about Niguma in the introduction. What does stand firmly as testimony to her existence, however, is her legacy of teachings, which form the very core of the Shangpa Kagyu lineage, one of the \"Eight Great Chariots of the Prac-tice Lineages\" that were later identified as the main conduits through which experiential Buddhism spread from India to Tibet.• The collection translated here consists of all of the works that are attributed to Niguma contained in the Tibetan Buddhist \"canon,\" a total of seventeen separate texts, plus the only known biography from the collected texts in the Shangpa tradition. 2 Most of these are only a few pages in length, though their original verses gave rise to a whole body of literature in the Shangpa practice tradition. The exception is her master work, the Stages in the Path of Illusion (sGyu ma lam gyi rim pa), and its commentary (sGyu ma lam gyi rim pa'i 'grel pa). This is our main focus here, though the other texts will be briefly introduced. Stages in the Path of Illusion depicts a spiritual journey, beginning with the point of departure, or \"ground\" -the underlying buddha-nature with its inherent potential for awakening. It takes us through the progres_sive journey common to Mahayana Buddhism, but with Niguma's distinctive twist of using the journey's illusory nature as our guide. That it is illusion is not in question. The crucial instruction is in"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xii .. Niguma. Lady of!Uusion the way to engage that insight to gain the goal of the journey, illusory buddhahood. It could be said that Niguma is the mistress of illusion. Not only is her very nature as a historical person obscure in every way and her main and only treatise focused on that subject, but the other teachings for which she is most famous also reverberate with this theme. The two principal areas of practice in the tradition are the yogas based on the Six Dharmas ofNiguma, with an emphasis on the illusory body and dream yogas, and the special Amulet Mahamudra, a practice of doing nothing. This twofold division of teachings represents the two univer-sal approaches in tantric practice: the path of methods or techniques (thabs lam) and the path of liberation (grollam ), which focuses on the cultivation of a superior way of knowing (shes rab ). The original verses or \"vajra lines\" (rdo rje tshig rkang) of these subjects are translated here. In the first category there are also flve very cryptic instructions (zhal gdams) concerning yogic exercises associated with the practice of inner heat (gtum mo ), one of the six dharmas. The mahamudra category includes an annotated version of the Amulet Mahamudra and a further instruction entitled Naturally Free Mahamudra. Two other very important source texts ofNiguma in this collection are Three Dharmas to Integrate on the Path (lam khyer gsum), which instruct the practitioner on how to integrate all appearances as the guru, the deity, and illusion in daily life, and Glorious Immortal Great Timeless Awareness, which contains teachings on the immortal and infallible nature of the mind and body.3 Together with the six dharmas and mahamudra, these form four of the famed Five Golden Dharmas of the Glorious Shangpa that make up the core of the tradition, and that will be discussed later. The fifth golden dharma, that of the two Kechari c;l.akinis, was not included in this canonical collection.

I will provide more context for the Shangpa literary and practice tradition in the introduction. The collection is capped off by the lyrical prayer known popularly as Niguma's Aspiration Prayer of the Sealed Word or simply Kagyama (bKa' rgya ma), in which she prays to \"become the protector, hope, and reinforcement for all sentient beings equaling space, their every desire and hope, whatever they are, satisfied by me exactly as they wish.\" I would like to add my own altruistic aspirations, otherwise stranded in the realm of wishful thinking, to be carried by Niguma's powerful blessing so that the work of translating her teachings will help accom-plish her profound prayer."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Acknowledgments I AM MOST GRATEFUL for help and comments by Acarya Lama Tenpa Gyaltsen in translating the Stages in the Path of Illusion and its commentary.

I will include here W the brief biography found in the Golden Rosary of Shangpa Biographies, but other than that, one finds only hints and guesses from other sources. For instance, here is a typical description from the great Tibetan master Taranatha: The <;lakini Niguma's place of birth was the Kashmiri city called \"Incomparable.\" Her father was the brahmin Santi-varman (Tib.: Zhi ba'i go cha). Her mother was Shrimati (dPalgyi blo gros rna). Her real name was Srijfiana (dPal gyi ye shes). She had previously gathered the accumulations [of merit and wisdom] for three incalculable eons. Thus, in this life [as Niguma], based on the teachings of the instructions by the adept Lavapa and some others, she manifested the signs of progress in the secret mantra vajrayana, and attained the body of union. So her body became a rainbow-like form. She had the ability to really hear teachings from the great Vajradhara. Having become a great bodhisattva, her emana-tions pervaded everywhere and accomplished the welfare of beings.6 The elusiveness ofNiguma is typical of the lore of the <;lakini, the very embodiment ofliminal spiritual experience. Additionally the difficulty"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"z. .. Niguma, Lady of!llusion of pinpointing historical information may well be due to the lack of ancient sources from India and the lack of concern about such mun-dane matters by the Tibetan masters who encountered her in dreams and visions and maybe in person. Afrer all, when confronted with the blazing apparition of the resplendent and daunting dark 9akini bestow-ing critical cryptic advice, a background check would be rendered irrel-evant. Indian Buddhist hagiographies are virtually unknown, whether of men or women.' In Tibet, where hagiography became a prolific genre in its own right, those of women were extremely rare, for all the usual reasons. It is in the experiences of those heroes who encountered the 9akini that one finds the most information, and these experiences are invested with the value of spiritual meaning. In the Golden Rosary of Shangpa Biographies, Niguma's life story consists of only six folios, and half of them contain a supplication prayer to her, while that of her dis-ciple Khyungpo Naljor, called a \"mere mention\" (zur tsam ), consists of forty-three folios, and those of her brother Naropa, U.ranatha, Tang-tong Gyalpo, and so forth where Niguma is mentioned are much lon-ger than that. Even more distressing, I have discovered that half of the remaining half ofNiguma's life story, the part that concerns her birth-place, appears to be directly lifted from a biography ofNaropa!8 Per-haps she is just an adornment of the lives of great saints, a figment of men's imaginations. That, of course, is something one has to wonder and worry about in nearly all of the more ancient writings about 9akinis. The idealized image of a female messenger, awesome keeper of the great mysteries to be revealed only to the deserving spiritual virtuoso, is packed with power and intrigue for both male and female practitioners. Though unique in its particulars to Himalayan Buddhism, it is found in remi-niscent forms throughout the cultures and religions of the world. The mystery of the 9akini herself will not be revealed because she is the very definition of mystery, and were she discovered by those other than mystics, it would not be she. But what of the actual woman behind the image? In the case of a reportedly historical woman such as Niguma, we should be able to find at least some hint of a subjective story, something to convince us that she is more than the object or projection of the practitioner's realiza-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introduction • 3 tion. And more than the \"other\" of the male \"sel£\" We seek her as the subject of her own story. NIGUMA'S HOME Niguma's life does present us with a few crumbs. First of all, her birth-place is known to be in Kashmir, a hub of Buddhist tantric activity that probably was in close quarters with the Shaivite tradition and other forms of esoteric Hinduism. The specific town, or perhaps monastery, is called Peme (dpe med) in Tibetan, meaning \"without comparison,\" translating the term \"Anupama.\"9 But we learn in her biography that this is not a real town, exactly, but one that has been created by an illu-sionist. So the first hard fact is already shaky. The story first mentions the creation myth, as it were, of Kashmir itself, a land that was once under water. According to Niguma's biography, the story takes place during the time of the previous buddha, Kashyapa, though in other ver-sions the story centers around Buddha Shakyamuni's time and his dis-ciple Ananda.10 In any case, a disciple wished to build a temple in the area ofKashmir and stealthily negotiated with the subterranean beings, or ndga, who were tricked into \"upmerging\" and surrendering a large area of land. It reports that the residents were amazed, though in the same story in Naropa's biography, it is the naga themselves who were amazed. In any case, the amazed ones commission an illusionist to cre-ate a city, which he does based on the \"blueprint\"' of the great celestial city of the gods called Sudarshana. But this talented architect-magician dies before he could dissolve the city, and so it remained. This, then, is Niguma's home town: a divinely inspired illusion. FAMILY AND FRIENDS Niguma's family relationships are similarly elusive, particularly when it comes to her connection with Naropa (9s6-Io4o),11 her contem-porary and a great adept whose teachings on the six dharmas that he learned from Tilopa spread widely in Tibet. The names of Niguma's parents given above by T\"aranatha are indeed the same as the names of Naropa's parents as given in his biography by Lhatsun Rinchen"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"4 ,. Niguma, Lady of Illusion Namgyal {I473-ISS7) and are similar in other biographies too.12 These biographies tell the story of those parents' first child, Shrijiiana, and how they had to perform special supplications for a male child after her birth. We also have the name of Naropa's wife, Vimala or Vimaladipi {Dri med pa or Dri med sgron rna), with whom he parted to pursue his spiritual career. Naropa is sometimes said to be from Bengal in the east, but there is little evidence for this theory, and most authors locate his birthplace in Kashmir, along with Niguma.13 There is even some evidence that Naropa's well-known hermitage ofP~hpahari, or Pulla-hari, commonly identified as being on a hillock west ofBodhgaya, may have been in Ka$hmir.14ln Niguma's biography, it simply mentions that Naropa was also in the area. Despite any misinformed discrepancies, it would seem to be quite clear that Niguma and Naropa were sister and brother. Yet scholars, mostly Western, have insisted on suggesting that Niguma was his consort, perhaps his sister too, in a sort of tantalizing tantric gossip. Alas it may be the great translator Herbert Guenther who started the trend. In his introduction to The Lift and Teaching of Naropa, he makes a most puzzling allusion: [Naropa's] wife seems to have gone by her caste name Ni-gu-ma, and according to the widely practiced habit of call-ing a female with whom one has had any relation 'sister' she became known as 'the sister ofNaropa.'15 Guenther cites The Blue Annals and the Collected Works of bLo bzang chos-kyi nyi-ma, an eighteenth-century Gelukpascholar known as Tuk-wan Lama, as the sources where \"Ni-gu-ma is stated to have been the wife of Naropa.'' However, both sources state nothing so definitive. The Blue Annals, which devotes most of a chapter to the accounts of Niguma and her lineage, mentions her only as Naropa's sister, 16 using the Tibetan word lcam mo, a combination of lcam {an honorific) and sring mo {sister). The second source similarly says only that she is Nigu-ma's lcam, 17 as do all other sources in Tibetan that I have seen. A suppli-cation to Niguma in the practice of the white and red Khechari <;lakinis uses the unambiguous term sring mo, calling her \"the single sister of the awareness-holder.\"18 Admittedly, the word lcam mo can be used as"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction • s mistress or wife, particularly as the senior of several wives, 19 but given this bivalent meaning and the fact that we have the identical parents' names and the name of Naropa's real wife, why on earth would one choose to translate it as \"wife\"? Even the translator Roerich does not do so in the Blue Annals and comments elsewhere that \"in the ancient language !cam means always 'sister'.\"ZO It does seem to be that tired old need to attribute a woman's worth to her mate that plagues the annals of history, coupled with the scholarly penchant for repeating the confi-dent pronouncements of former scholars. Another possible source of confusion pertains to a supposed meet-ing between Naropa's Tibetan disciple Marpa and Niguma. In the introduction to the translation of Tsangnyon Heruk.a's biography of Marpa called The Life of Marpa the Translator, the following informa-tion is offered, repeating the relationship in an even stranger way: After attaining his first realization of mahamudra under Maitripa, Marpa returned to Naropa.This time, Naropasent Marpa to receive teachings from Niguma, Wisdom (Jnana) Dakini Adorned with Bone ornaments. She was Naropa's wife before he renounced worldly life to enter the dharma, and later she became his student and consort. Finally, she became a great teacher herself and her lineage of teachings was taken to Tibet (though not by Marpa) and continues to this present day. Unfortunately. our story here does not tell us very much about their meeting (xliii). The Tibetan text reveals that Marpa was indeed sent on two separate occasions, first by Naropa and later by Shantibhadra, to meet a cer-tain <;lakini called simply by the metonym \"Adorned with Bone Orna-ments.\"21 Nowhere does it mention Niguma -specifically by name in this or other biographies ofMarpa. It is true that in later eulogies Niguma is described as wearing bone ornaments·, but I believe this could be con-sidered a regular wardrobe for c;lakinis; whose options were generally confined to charnel grounds. Better evidence of their identity than sim-ilar attire would be that both Marpa's c;lakini and Khyungpo Naljor's Niguma can sometimes both be found in the same great cemetery of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"6 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion Sosadvipa (Tib. Sosaling), said to be just to the west ofBodhgaya and the vacation spot of many a great master, including Padmasambhava. It was also, however, a famous <;lakin! gathering spot. In Marpa's biogra-phy, he finds the bone-decked <;lakin! on two occasions: once he receives the empowerment and instructions in the Four Seats Tantra from her, and a second time he receives a prophecy about meeting Naropa (after he had already passed away).22 Given the widespread prevalence, even requirement, of <;l.akini encounters on the spiritual path of yogis, this account gives us nothing to cling to. Moreover, there is no account wherein Niguma receives any teachings from Naropa, though the sim-ilarity of the content of their teachings might lead one to believe other-wise. But how do we know that it was not the other way around-that Naropa did not receive teachings from his big sister? TEACHERS The only piece of specific information about Niguma's teachers that I have from my sources is her connection with a certain Lavapa, accord-ing to two accounts by Taranatha. However Lavapa is not mentioned by name in Niguma's Life Story, where it says only that \"she directly saw the truth of the nature of phenomena just by hearing some instruc-tive advice from a ftw adept masters.\" The only two named masters in the Life Story are Naropa and Ratnavajra, and then only as cohabitants in Kashmir. 23 Again, the commonly held belief that Niguma received the six dharmas from Naropa seems to be unsubstantiated. In fact, the Blue Annals, following a similar statement in Khyungpo Naljor's biog-raphy, quotes Niguma saying that \"these six doctrines are known only to myself and Lavapa.\"24 It is, however, difficult to identify this Lavapa. Taranatha provides some nice anecdotes of an acarya Lavapa in The Seven Instruction Lin-eages and discusses him again in his History. 25 He is also mentioned by Naropa's guru, Tilopa, as one of his four human teachers and the one from whom he received dream yoga, or lucid clarity, depending on the account.26 Some sources identify Acarya Lavapa with Kambhalapada, one of the eighty-four great adepts (mahdsiddhas) of Indian Bud-dhism who is associated with the conversion activities in the west of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction .. 7 India.27 Taranacha does not seem to make chis identity and we are lefi: with a lack of information on chis \"Lavapa of the East,\" other than chat he is called \"the lesser (chat is, younger), or latter Lavapa.\" Here is another version by Taranacha, with its veiled jab at this unidentified Lavapa: She listened for a bit to instructions from Lavapa of the East, and afi:er medicating for seven days together with the master himself, she became a <;lakini of timeless awareness with a rainbow body. She manifested the realization of the eighth ground. It is said chat Lavapa of the East [did not gain the full rainbow body because he ]left behind a palm-sized portion of the crown of his head. This Lavapa is the lesser. The name Nigu accords with the Indian language, which is Nigupta, and it is said to mean \"truly secret\" or \"truly hid-den.\" In fact, it is the code-language of the <;lakinis of time-less awareness.28 CODE-LANGUAGE The symbolic or code-language of the <;lakinis (mkha' gro'i brda' skad) is itself\"cruly hidden.\" Masters of meditation decipher these commu-nications in moments of inspiration, but by the time we hear what they might be, they have already been translated and carry all the perils of that craft, including possible fraud. We can see a few indecipherable graphics called \"<;lakini code-letters\" (mkha' gro brda'yig) in treasure texts, but even this is only a subcategory of the mystery code-language itself. In his commentary on the treasure text Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpo, Jamgon Kongtrul explains: A person endowed with the karmic continuation and des-tiny will, by means of a profound coincidence of place, time, and aspiration, be able to decode the symbolic meaning of these treasure letters that are nirma!fakayas, the vajra forms endowed with all eminent aspects, and establish them cor-rectly in writing.2'"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"8 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion Perhaps the <,iakini code-language is beyond verbal communication, with its necessarily dualistic and designatory nature. But then why call it \"language\"? Symbolic communication is specifically distinguished from nonverbal transmission in the Nyingma tripartite transmissions of dzogchen teachings, where the symbolic lineage of the awareness-holders (rig 'dzin brda'i brgyud pa) falls neatly between the nonverbal lineage of the buddhas' \"thought\" or intention, and the aural lineage of ordinary people. Janet Gyatso suggests that the <,iakini, in keeping with her playful character, is \"working within language to subvert it, drawing attention to its own (dualistic) structures while never retreat-ing outside its realm.\"30 And certainly the esoteric teachings of the tan-tras themselves in their written form are known to be coded. After all, the common name for those teachings is \"secret mantra\" (gsang sngags ). The <,iakini code-language is a secret within that secret and seems to be reserved for the most profound and spontaneous experiences of only very gifted practitioners. 'laranatha makes no attempt to tell us what the name \"Niguma\" really means in that language, leaving it rather to the initiated to find out. In a similar way it is difficult to precisely identify Niguma's other attributes that recur in most sources, although they are reported as quantifiable facts. She had high-level realization, placing her in the \"pure\" (dagpa) or nondissipating (zagmed) grounds, she attained the so-called rainbow body, and most famously, she could receive teach-ings directly from Vajradhara. What do these qualities actually mean, apart from being ways to impress us? PURE GROUND The first attribute is at least locatable in the mahayana map to enlight-enment, or road to glory, as some have put it. The milestones on this journey are a main subject in the Commentary to Stages in the Path of Illusion and will be discussed in more detail later. The division into any-where from ten to fourteen levels or stations (literally \"grounds\" Skt. bhumi, Tib. sa) has become somewhat standardized and carries desig-nations of either pure or impure. The impure stages are the grounds up to and including the seventh since there is still the risk that someone"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Introduction .. 9 of low acumen could revert to a lesser degree of enlightenment. The grounds from the eighth and up are pure grounds since there can be no reverting from them.31 Taranatha designates Niguma's position as on only the eighth ground. By her own admission (if indeed she is the true source of the commentary to the Path of Illusion), she states confidently: \"The author is myself, one who dwells on the three pure grounds and has obtained authorization from Vajradhara.\"32 The Life Story reveals more of a progression through these last pure grounds, cul-minating in the tenth ground, \"Cloud of Dharma,\" so-called because, as it says in the commentary, \"cloud-like great timeless awareness per-vades throughout the sky-like dharmakaya.\" Here is her description from Path of Illusion: Then, in a single instant, amidst the great appearance of dharma and immeasurable light and dharma clouds and dharma appearance and dharma light of immeasurable tathagatas, the immeasurably great Cloud of Dharma is attained.33 After the culmination of the tenth ground, wherein the perfection of timeless awareness is achieved, there is the state of total awakening as a buddha. Different systems describe different ways that this final trans-formation occurs, as we shall see, and often further levels are enumer-ated. Twelve are described in Path of Illusion, but it seems that more levels were always being added, especially in the dzogchen tradition, making buddhahood ever more distant. In any case, awesome as Nigu-ma's tenth-ground status appears, with its \"twelve hundred sets of unimaginable qualities; she herself warns that \"the difference between buddhas and bodhisattvas is like the difference in the waters of the ocean and in the hoof print of an ox.\"34 RAINBOW BODY The language of the paths and levels in general is so dazzling as to ren-der one impotent.

Descriptions ofNiguma are all ephemeral because they are descriptions not of a person but of a yogic experience. Later visionary accounts of her, such as that ofTangtong Gyalpo, are of course out of this world. But even the supposedly \"real-time\" encoun-ters described in the biography of Khyungpo Naljor are dreamlike, if not dreams in fact. Rainbows are one of the primary examples of phe-nomena that both appear distinctly and yet are insubstantial, so it is not surprising to hear that the ~akinis encountered in paranormal or limi-nal states of consciousness are described as being rainbow-like. Words could only point to such an experience by evoking in us a similar expe-rience, and even then must fall tragically short. But far beyond a mere metaphor, the phenomenon known as \"rainbow body\" has produced considerable speculation and technically specific statistics-as though it truly existed. Perhaps the rainbow body is a poetic trope of mystical virtuosos used to communicate their innermost experiences. Whether this actually produced the attempt to identify and locate the phenom-enon in the maps of spiritual progress cannot be known. But at least in some literature, the rainbow body is described quite specifically, one might even say concretely, as when Taranatha weighs the exact portion ofLavapa's body that did not rainbow-ize in the above story. There is an enormous amount of material concerning the phenom-enon of light that permeates almost all aspects of Buddhism, and it is not uncommon in other spiritual traditions as well. These many aspects are not irrelevant, but just too much to cover here, and I refer the reader to other sources.35 For our immediate purpose, I could at least narrow the field by pointing out that the majority of the material in the Buddhist tradition concerns the nature of the mind, whether it be the light that describes its essence of clear awareness, or the light that is an actual perception of luminosity (either could be indicated by the Tibetan terms gsa! ba and 'od gsa!). But the term \"rainbow body\" (}a' Ius) concerns an actual physical body that is transformed in its very nature into another kind of appearing phenomenon that is like a rain-bow. The simple dictionary definition is \"the corporeal body liberated"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Introduction _. 11 into a body of light.\"36 This sometimes occurs at death, in which case the corpse either disappears altogether, leaving only fingernails and hair, or else shrinks, a phenomenon known as \"lesser rainbow body.\" This phenomenon has been reported throughout Tibetan history up to the present. For instance, a person who observed the funeral of Lama Norbu Dondrup, the teacher of the late Kalu Rinpoche, reported that his body had diminished to the size of a baby.37 In the dzogchen tradition, it is said to be the product of very specific and intentionally designed practices, unique to that tradition. Accord-ing to the modern Tibetan master Namkhai Norbu, what occurs is that \"instead of decomposing into its constituent elements in the usual way, [the body] dissolves into the essence of its elements, which is light.\"38 However in certain other tantric traditions, such as Kalachakra, it can be the product of particular completion phase yogic practices that work with the subtle energetic body with its potential for enlightenment.39 Again, it occurs based on inner heat practices in the Kagyu tradition: The ultimate attainment, like using quicksilver to transform iron into pure gold, is that the quintessence of the channels, energy currents, and vital essences will increase, gradually consuming the refuse and transforming the body into the actual rainbow body of inseparable form-emptiness, the sarpbhogakaya. 40 It becomes clear that these are not just remarkable death stories, how-ever astonishing. The Tibetan developments of the esoteric instruc-tions concerning this phenomenon perhaps eventually grew into a way to identify the ultimate fruition of practice and hence to describe enlightened beings as well as the practitioner's effulgent experiences of them. Whether applied retroactively or not, the salient point of assign-ing the rainbow body to the great masters of the past, such as Niguma, would seem to be to explain their remarkable and continuing appear-. ance in the lives of their devotees, long after their possible normal life spans. In some places, Niguma is even named \"she with the death-less body of a rainbow.\"41 About this on-going beneficence, Namkhai Norbu continues,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"12 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion But a practitioner who perfects and completes the fourth level of the Todgal [thod rgal] visions do~s not manifest death at all, and makes this transubstantiation while actu-ally living, with none of the symptoms or phenomena of a physical death, gradually becoming invisible to someone with normal karmic vision. This level of realization is called the 'Great Transfer: and this is the realization that Padma-sambhava and Vimalamitra manifested. Both the Great Transfer and the Body of Light [i.e., rainbow body] are in essence the same; it is just that, in the Great Transfer, one arrives earlier.42 Although that particular terminology is specific to the dzogchen liter-ature, it must be that they refer to a similar or equivalent phenomenon, as do a variety of other terms such as \"body of union\" (zung Juggisku), \"vajra body\" (rdo rje sku), and so on. Such terms are found mainly in the context of vajrayana, and we don't find such language in the Indian mahayana delineation of paths and grounds.43 Later, Tibetan scholars attempted to correlate the two vehicles of spiritual journeying. How-ever, when and where the transmutation occurs in relationship to the mahayana path is difficult to pinpoint {as is befitting of an idea that intentionally indicates elusiveness). In the system ofHighest Yoga Tan-tra,Jamgon Kongtrul mentions it in connection with the peak experi-ence, which is the second ground on the third path.44 According to the general correspondences of the five paths and ten grounds, this would not even be the first ground of a bodhisattva, which does not begin until the Path of Seeing. Again, in the same source, the term \"rainbow body\" is used in connection with the first ground in the Kalachakra system, but with the caveat that the term refers to an approximation of the ultimate accomplishment.45 Finally we find it again in the final Path of Consummation as the ultimate achievement of enlighten-ment.46 Another source, Dagpo Tashi Namgyal, similarly assigns it to the highest, or thirteenth,level.47 What are we to make of these various assignments in relation to Niguma? Jamgon Kongtrul may be trying to clarify this in the following passage:"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"-Introduction • 13 It can be determined that the fruition aspect of tantra is two-fold: the actual fruition and the nominal results. The actual fruition is that of supreme Vajradhara, the powerful state of mastery over all family types. The nominal results are those of the illusory body and of an ordinary being who has real-ized primordial unity. The latter case is the flawed embodi-ment of one who is still on the path of training, while the former is the flawless embodiment of timeless awareness of one who has reached the path of no more training. The illu-sory body is also termed that of\"a master of awareness\" and \"rainbow body\"; it constitutes a complete transcendence of the three realms.48 We have seen already that by all accounts Niguma was considered a bodhisattva of the pure grounds, that is, the eighth to the tenth grounds. Her rainbow body must be an attainment less than that of total bud-dhahood, otherwise it might be expected that her appearances were a manifestation of sarp.bhogakaya, the body of total enjoyment, which is an embodiment of a buddha only perceptible by bodhisattvas with extremely pure vision, themselves abiding on the eighth ground or above. If that were the case, what would we make of the. fact that she received teachings from the buddha Vajradhara? Why would she even need to do that? And what does it mean to say that? These questions are given added urgency in the biography ofKhyungpo Naljor, who roamed India specifically in search of those who had \"met the buddha.\" BUDDHA SPEAKING One might be surprised to find that the Golden Rosary oJShangpa Biog-raphies begins with the \"life story\" of the buddha Vajradhara, inciden-tally by the same author as that ofNiguma's biography.49 \"Life story\" is a functional translation of namtar (rnam par thar pa) in Tibetan, which literally means \"total liberation.\" We are accustomed to these accounts' tracing at least some trajectory of the aspirant's journey to the liber-ated state, so it is odd to find such a genre applied to an epitomized"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"14 • Niguma, Ladyof!llusion buddha. In chis \"biography,\" Vajradhara is described as the inner aspect of the buddha Shakyamuni. In this form, the Buddha taught the four classes of cancra to King Indrabhuti, \"he\" abides until the end of time, and he dwells in that mysterious place called the bhaga of the vajra queen.so As Shakyamuni, therefore, he in fact does make a spiritual journey that began with the initial arousing of the spirit of supreme awakening. This inner aspect is called Vajradhara because of \"holding (Skt. dhara) the adamantine or vajra-like absorption of the nature of phenomena.\"s' Buddhas have many dimensions. After presenting vari-ous enumerations ofbuddha-bodies or kayas (sku), this text settles on the usual three: dharmakaya, the body of dharma, sarpbhogakaya, the body of perfect engagement, and nirma!).akaya, the body of emana-tion. Vajradhara as buddha manifests all three. But which Vajradhara does Niguma meet? All indications point to the sarpbhogakaya Vajra-dhara, an actual findable buddha, the intermediary or liminal form of buddha that facilitates communication, not the all-encompassing spa-cious buddha-mind of dharmakaya. In Vajradhara's biography the ques-tion arises, \"To whom do the three kayas appear?\" It is answered quite succinctly: The dharmakaya free of all embellishment [appears) in the meditative equipoise above the first ground. The sarpbhoga-kaya adorned with the signs and marks appears in the subse-quent knowing on the three pure grounds. The nirma!).akaya appears in the subsequent knowing up through the seventh ground and above the greater [ground] of the Path of Accumulation. sz It is interesting that the dharmakaya is accessible first, though specifi-cally in meditation. It seems more profound, the ground of all buddha-bodies, and therefore more difficult to realize. But the keener realization is to meet the fully adorned and manifesting buddha, not in medita-tion but in the subsequent awareness after meditation-in \"daily life\" so to speak. In fact, according to this statement, the nirmiiJ_lakaya, the actual Shakyamuni or other physical emanation, does not appear to"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introduction .. 15 someone dwelling above the seventh ground. In other words, the high-est bodhisattvas dwelling on the three pure grounds only encounter the sarpbhogakaya. They know the manifest appearance of enlightenment, or perhaps that appearance is enlightenment. It must be this sarpbhogakaya that is meant in the Stages in the Path of Illusion: The Commentary where the imminent attainment of the tenth ground is \"to see the Body of the tathagata [in] a fathom of light of a color like gold, completely surrounded by ten million bil-lion brahmas.\"53 And this must be why Khyungpo Naljor is so deter-mined to find someone who has directly encountered the buddha. For if someone had perceived a buddha, that is, a sa.rpbhogakaya, it would indicate the highest of realizations, higher than even finding dharmakaya, which would be merely \"abiding in one's own mind pure as space.\"54 Although he has already met many great masters of India, Khyungpo Naljor wants to meet an actual person who moves in the world with constant and normalized awareness of all dimensions and who can move between those dimensions with ease. In other words, a traveler through space-a <;lakin!. As much as I have searched for this <,lakin! named Niguma and hoped to find her as an actual person and the subject of her own story, it may have been in vain. The more I dig, the more elusive she becomes. No doubt I am looking in all the wrong places, in old books and dusty corners. Still, I hope that this might be more than another case of the female as a vehicle of meaning for men, or that, as one post-Buddhist feminist puts it, \"the place of the male as subject is unconsciously pro-tected, whilst creating a notion of fluidity around the concept of the female body.\"\" I might have to admit, however, that she is primarily an important event in the lives of the men who saw her, rather than a his-torically locatable person. Those men, in any case, are really the only sources of information about her. Her own story, if it ever existed, is not to be found apart from the few details that I have explored here.

Niguma, Lady oj1/lusion STORIES OF NIGUMA KHYUNGPO NALJOR's NIGUMA {This section is a summary based on the Brief Life Story of Lama Khyungpo Naljor found in the Golden Rosary of Shangpa Biographies, vol. 1, 59-143·) After studying with many gurus in Nepal and India, the Tibetan yogi Khyungpo Naljor resolved to find someone who had met the Buddha face-to-face. He was directed to Niguma, who was reported to have received teachings from the great Vajradhara. Inquiring as to where she was at present, he was told that if one had pure perception, one could see her face anywhere, but those with impure perception might search up and down without ever finding her. That was because she dwelt on the pure grounds and had transformed to a rainbow body. \"Pure grounds\" are certainly a matter of perception, rather than loca-tion. Nevertheless, they said, she occasionally shows up in the forest of a great charnel ground, Sosadvipa, to preside over the feast circles of <;lakinis. Inspired, Khyungpo travels there immediately, while pay-ing homage to the Buddha. He sees a dark <;lakin! hovering in the sky, bedecked in bones and holding a trident and skull-cup, dancing about and displaying various forms, appearing sometimes as one and some-times many. Convinced it is she, Khyungpo requests teachings, but the <;lakin! is uncooperative. \"I am a flesh-eating <;lakin!,\" she says. \"When my retinue arrives, you'll be devoured. Get out now.\" Flesh-eating <;lakinis may have been the original <;lakin is of Indian lore, those scary females that populated the charnel grounds and other places where god-fearing people dared not tread. They constellate some of our greatest fears and are never far behind the more beneficent fig-ures that entice and instruct the Tibetan adepts. 56 Here, the gimmick of terrorizing the aspirant as a test of determination is of course a common element in hero stories. At the same time, it is not entirely a ruse. The chimerical <;lakin!, or the energy she represents, could turn dangerous at any time and devour rather than nurture the practitioner. Khyungpo, undeterred, again requests instruction in secret mantra."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Introduction .. 17 \"To request secret mantra mahayana requires gold. If there's gold, I'll do it;' the #kini retorts. Khyungpo offers her the nearly impossible amount of five hun-dred gold srang, but she just throws it about the forest. 57 At this point Khyungpo starts to wonder if she really is a flesh-eating <;lakin! since she does not want the gold. It is difficult not to speculate about the implication here: that a genuine <;lakin! would be greedy for gold, but apparently a flesh-eating <;lakin! is satisfied with-well, flesh. The <;lakin! then glares into space to invoke her vast <;lakin! entou-rage, who begin constructing, in space, all the requisites for an empow-erment, such as palace, sand mandala, and feast provisions. She then bestows the empowerments for the practices of illusory body and dream, tells Khyungpo to get up, and then transports him miraculously about twenty-five miles. There, in the sky above a golden mountain like the great Mount Avrha,58 the <;iakinis perform the feast ceremony and dance about. The golden mountain has four rivers of gold pouring from the four sides, and Khyungpo asks if it can really be somewhere in India or if it is the <;iakini's magical projection. To this she replies with perhaps the most famous verse associated with Niguma, reiterated in various ways in the Path of Illusion: This variety of desirous and hateful thoughts that strands us in the ocean of cyclic existence59 once realized to be without intrinsic nature, makes everything a golden land, child. If you meditate on the illusion-like nature of illusion-like phenomena, actual illusion-like buddhahood will occur through the power of devotion. Niguma then commands Khyungpo to recognize his dreams by means of her blessing, which he does indeed do. He continues to have the very dreamy experience of traveling to the land of gods and demigods, being swallowed whole by a gigantic demigod, and receiving the entire instruction on the Six Dharmas from Niguma. She even mentions, in"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"18 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion his dream, that no one but he has ever received the complete teaching in one nap in all of India. What is never clarified is the starting point of the dream experience: whether it was fro~ the time of being trans-ported to the Golden Mountain or from his first encounter with the 9akini. He recognizes the dream only after she blesses him to so do. In any case, he now wakes up and \"really\" (dngos su) receives the guidance on the Six Dharmas again three times, along with a number of other instructions.60 In short, the story goes on to say, Khyungpo received boundless tantras, sadhanas, and instructions from this 9akini of timeless aware-ness. Ever insatiable, Khyungpo Naljor continues on his quest, offer-ing pounds of gold to many more teachers. Again asking for one who has seen the Buddha, he is directed to the other principal 9akini in the lineage, Sukhasiddhi. That is another story, but with many similar elements. Of the twenty-eight or so Indian and Nepali gurus that are mentioned by name in Khyungpo Naljor's biography, seven of them are female. This fact is not emphasized in anyway, and one might feel it to be quite normal and unremarkable. Female gurus in India, though cer-tainly a minority, continue to be commonly accepted up to the present. Possibly it was in Tibet that it became such an exception.

The great adept [Tangtong Gyalpo] then practiced these profound instructions [on Niguma's teachings received from living masters) in an isolated and pleasant wilderness hermitage. Many types of medita-tive concentration arose in his mind, so that he considered spreading this profound oral transmission in these glacial mountain ranges. At that moment a clear voice from the sky called out, \"Son!

At that time they fully engaged in the great secret practices, such as questions and responses, symbols and return symbols, and happily enjoyed the miraculous sen-sory objects of a ritual feast. On that occasion, Niguma deciphered and fully instructed the great adept in each of the Vajra Lines by means of actual, implied, and hid-den oral instructions. In particular, she bestowed the extremely pro-found transference practices of the infallible White and Red Khecaris, together with instructions for enhancing them by means of two examples sealed by her command. When he put these into practice, he gained an inconceivable repertoire of attainments, such as the instan-taneous display of countless physical forms in just a single moment, a clairvoyant knowledge of others' minds, and the ability to actually transfer [the consciousness] when he performed the transference for another person. Later, on the peak of the famous glorious Riwoche in Lato Jang that was the adept's home, he was given permission by the qakini and placed in writing the guidance manual for this profound path, the Collection of the Essentials, together with the affiliated texts. But the oral instruc-tions for the transference practices of the White and Red Khecaris, together with the illustration of the two examples, he taught with the tune of the indestructible ndda.61 MOKCHOKPA'S NIGUMA The following is translated from the Golden Rosary of Shangpa Biog-raphies, and constitutes the second account there, immediately after that of Buddha Vajradhara.

Lhatsun Rinchen Namgyal wrote, in 1503, that he had copied the Life Story ofBuddha Vajradhara specifically from that of Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsondru.

With that, I would express here just a fraction of the life story of Niguma, the <;lakini of timeless awareness. The land of her birth was the great city called Anupama [Incompara-ble], located in Kashmir. That place, moreover, was a city emanated by an illusionist. The way in which it was emanated is this: During the time of the previous buddha, Kashyapa, there was an arhat named Madhyantika [Midday Sun].65 At that distant time the entire area was covered by water. The arhat wished to build a vihara in that country, so he requested land from the naga king.66 The nagas said, \"We will give you as much land as you can cover sitting in lotus posture.\" Then the arhat emanated a huge body there that covered all the territories of Kashmir. As the nagas had promised, ground arose there and a vihara called Amrtabhavana was built.67 The local people were truly amazed, so they sent for an illusionist."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introduction \" 2.1 That illusionist emanated the great city called Anupama, by using the example of the great [city of] Sudarshana.68 But before the illusion could be dissolved, the illusionist was killed, and so it has remained until now.

Her dissipating illusory body arose as the nondissipating kaya. Dwelling in the three pure grounds, she encountered the great Vajradhara in person. After she had fully received from him the complete four empowerments in the emanated mandala of secret mantra mahayana, she developed the timeless aware-ness of the understanding of all dharma doors-siitras, tantras, esoteric instructions, treatises, and so on.

In particular, she gave many profound and vast pithy instructions that have the power to establish worthy recipients in the awakened state of manifest realization with one body in one life-time. Niguma sealed this with the command that it not spread beyond a one-to-one lineage for seven generations. She then prophesied that the disciples and holders of this lineage would all go to the celestial realm, Khechara. Such is this very lineage that is exalted above others.72 This is the mere mention of the liberation story of the <Jakin! of timeless awareness, written for the realization of the lineage holders by the vaga-bond73 Mokchokpa in the Glorious Monastery ofGyere Yang6n.74 By this merit may all persons who hold the lineage maintain themselves in the manner of the guru's life story. By the pure white virtue of writing this, may I and the sponsors, teachers, and students, and all sentient beings of the three realms, quickly attain unsurpassed awakening. THE TEXTUAL TRADITION The decision to limit the choices for this collection ofNiguma's work to the selection in the so-called Tibetan Canon is somewhat random. The tendency to regard this canon as definitive is always tenuous. There are currently as many as ten known canons, and their formation and histor-ical links to each other are not well documented, although research is proceeding. The most basic division in all cases is between the kangyur, the translated words of Buddha Shakyamuni in one form or another, and the tengyur, the translations of treatises by Indian authors such as Niguma that comment upon those 'original' words. With more than s,250 texts, the Tibetan Buddhist canon contains the textual corpus oflndian Buddhism that was translated into Tibetan and which forms the foundation of the practice of Buddhism in the Himalayan region. The tremendous amount of literary output by Tibetans themselves is, for the most part, not included in the canons, where all sources arc held to be Indian. Thus for a text to be included, or excluded, from"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction ... 2.3 any particular canon may be construed as a comment on its origin and even its authenticity, where authenticity is defined as having Indian ori-gins. It almost goes without saying that the decisions about and prepa-rations of the canons nearly a millennium after Buddhist teachings first reached Tibet were fraught with trouble, politics, biases, and, surely, some serious scholarship. The intricacies and implications of the pro-cess make for very interesting research but will not be explored here. What is of interest to us is that not all of Niguma's works are included in all versions of the tengyur, and with one exception, they are most conspicuously missing from the widespread Derge Canon in its many editions.75 The one exception is the short ritual practice of the deity Hevajra included in the Derge Tengyur, and set apart in the Peking Tengyur in a different volume than all the rest of her works. It is interesting too that, of all these texts attributed to Niguma, this is the only one not in common use in the living Shangpa tradition. The deity Hevajra, so important in the Kagyu and Lamdre lineages, plays only a small role in the Shangpa practice ofFive Tantras' Deities, although the empowerment of Nine Emanated Deities ofHevajra was bestowed on Khyungpo Naljor directly by Niguma.76 I do not mean to read too much into this oddity. Simple omission is certainly a possibility when dealing with thousands of texts being compiled in different corners of a vast country, where communications moved at the speed ofhorses at best and printing was a matter of carving blocks of wood in mirror image for each and every page. I just present it here as a point of interest for further speculation. It seems to suggest that those tengyurs that do contain the majority \"bundle\" ofNiguma's work, such as the Peking and Narthang Tengyurs, had access to local Shangpa collections while others did not. One might have expected the opposite, that is, that the corpus ofNiguma's work would be in the tengyur printed in Derge, the physical center of the later eclectic move-ment (ris med) that played such a pivotal role in rescuing the Shangpa teachings from obscurity.n But it could be that the geographical loca-tion of the earliest Shangpa establishments in the far west of Tsang, far from the Derge cultural arena, played a role in this. Finally, given the obscurity ofNiguma and her historicity, it is possible that the compil-ers of the Derge Canon had doubts as to the true Indic origins of these"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"1.4 • Nigumtl, L.ul_y of Illusion texts. In any case, we find them now only in the closely related Peking, Narthang, and Golden Tengyurs.78 Perhaps the earliest inclusion ofShangpa texts in a collection besides these tengyurs is to be found in the massive collection ofBodong Chok-ley Namgyal (1376-1451). It is said that he received a direct transmis-sion from the two 9akinis Niguma and Sukhasiddhi, the two primary sources of the Shangpa tradition, at the age of sixteen, presumably in visionary experience.79 Bodong's core collection, The Compendium of Suchness in four forms and 137 volumes, may be considered a sort of canon, although it also contains works by Tibetan authors. It forms the bulk of the Tibet House publication called Encyclopedia Tibetica, or Collected I#Jrks ofBodong Chokley Namgyal. Bodong's bold project, at which he succeeded, was to comment on everything conceivable and organize all the teachings of Buddhism in a comprehensive manner. Because of this style of organization by subject, the works attributed to Niguma are scattered among three separate volumes, interspersed with other works and Bodong's own exegeses on the subject.80 We find there some of the works presented in this collection, as well as some of the instructional guides (khrid yig) on these practices also attributed to Niguma but left out of the tengyur.81 The Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC ) holds a copy of a two-volume handwritten manuscript of Shangpa texts found in the monastery of Sangak Choling in .Kinnaur, a county in Himachal Pradesh bordering on Tibet. 82 Many of the Shangpa texts found in the tengyur are also included in these two volumes, 83 along with some very interesting and apparently unique texts from the lineage that need to be researched further. In addition TBRC holds a rare handwritten copy of the Path of illusion and its Commentary, which I have also consulted for this translation. Other sources for Shangpa texts include the collected works of past masters who received both the original teachings from lineage hold-ers, called the \"long lineage\" (ring brgyud), and were granted further instructions and empowerments in direct visions ofNiguma, called the short or \"direct lineage\" (nye brgyud). Of these, the most famous is the great adept Tangtong Gyalpo (1361?-1485), whose visions of Niguma are recounted above.84 He did not write down the instructions that he"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Introduction .., 2.5 received until Niguma granted permission in a third vision in I458. They are known as the Collection of the Essentials, and with a set of related teachings formed a branch of the Shangpa Kagyu called the Tangtong Gyalpo Tradition (Thang lugs). They are contained in Sup-plemental Texts to the Collected 1-Vorks ofThang stong rgyal po Series. 85 In the Jonang tradition, Kunga Drolchok (IS07-IS66) is said to have received the long lineage many times and the direct lineage twice from Niguma in pure visions.86 Since he also received guidance more than a hundred times in twenty-five lineages, his very diverse collection is called Hundred Guides ofjonang and is supplemented by sources and histories.87 His immediate incarnation, the great Tiiranatha (IS 7S-I63s), minces no words in describing his own mastery of these teachings. He made important contributions to the body of Shangpa literature that can be found among his Collected 1-Vorks.88 These include both histories of the lineage and probably the most widely used practice guides. The works of both of these masters were included in the later collec-tions ofJamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye (I 8 I 3-I 9 oo ). This great eclectic savant gathered what he considered the most crucial of the Shangpa cycle of teachings in the collection known as Treasury of Instructions. They constitute two volumes (eleven and twelve) in the eighteen-vol-ume edition. But only two of our original Niguma texts are included there: Vtljra Lines of the Six Dharmas and Niguma's Aspiration Prayer. Mostly this collection contains works by later holders of the lineage and by Kongtrul himself. All of Kongtrul's own compositions related to the Shangpa tradition are found in his Treasury of Extensive Teach-ings, volumes eight and nine. The definitive and probably final collection in Tibetan of Shangpa texts was gathered by the late great master and lineage holder Karma Rangjung Kunchab (I 9os-I 9 8 9), better known in the west as Kalu Rin-poche. It consists of eleven volumes and is entitled Indian Source Texts of the Dharma Cycle of Five Golden Dharmas of the Glorious Shangpa. 89 A later tide within the texts, however, admits \"Indian and Tibetan Source Texts\" and is more reflective of the actual contents since very few Indian texts are represented.

Niguma, Lady of Illusion the three-year retreat facility founded by Jamgon Kongtrul.90 All of the works attributed to Niguma that I have translated here are included in that collection, with the conspicuous exception of the Hevajra sadhana. In addition there are copious compositions and commentaries from all lines of the Shangpa tradition, as well as sources from other lineages that are commonly used as practice material in the tradition. At present this collection forms the primary source for all practice and is transmitted in its entirety through a series of empowerments and scriptural transmission by lineage holders up to the present. It forms the basis especially of the three-year retreat tradition from Palpung that Kalu Rinpoche continued in India and the West, and in which I was privileged to participate. Most recently, in September of 2008, the young incarnation Kalu Yangsi Rinpoche completed this same retreat based on these same teaching transmissions that were granted to him by the late Bokar Rinpoche, dharma heir of the previous Kalu Rinpoche. The next collection ofShangpa texts will be the highly anticipated Eng-lish translation of necessary three-year retreat texts that was initiated by Bokar Rinpoche shortly before his passing on August 18, 2004. Finally, a necessarily brief survey of some available tides in English thus far: In 1978 the scholar Matthew Kapstein wrote an article called \"The Shangs-pa bKa' -brgyud: An Unknown Tradition ofTibetan Buddhism.\" Thanks in part to his own extensive research in this and other articles,9' this is no longer an entirely appropriate title since the tradition has become rather well known. Well before that, George Roer-ich's translation of The Blue Annals, a historical work by Go Lotsawa Zhunnu Pal, was first published in 1949, and contains \"The Book on Ko-brag pa and Ni-gu,\" a required unreadable reading. Then, the not-to-be-forgotten eccentric Yogi Chen received profound instructions in Shangpa practice from Kalu Rinpoche and wrote his own versions and translations into Chinese and sponsored English translations that are still available on his web site. The bibliographer Gene Smith wrote a short introduction to a new edition of the Shangpa Golden Rosary in the fifreenth volume of the Smanrtsis Shesrig Spendzod collection en ti-ded \"The Shangs pa Bka' brgyud Tradition;' first published in 1970 and now found in his Among Tibetan Texts.

Nicole Riggs has translated most of the life stories mentioned above in Like an Illusion, and Ngawang Zangpo has provided translations of the spiritual songs of the lineage masters in the volume Timeless Rapture, which includes brief stories and trans-lated praises as well. Additionally, some of the Shangpa practices are outlined by him in]amgon Kongtrul's Retreat Manual. An important text used in the Shangpa tradition as a basis for preliminary practices called \"Stages in the Path of the Three Types of Person\" (sKyes bugsum gyi lam rim) by T:i.ranatha has been translated as Essence of Ambrosia by Willa Baker. Finally, my translation of Jamgon Kongtrul's synopsis ofShangpa esoteric instructions constitutes chapters in Jamgon Kong-trul, The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Eight, Part Four: Esoteric Instruc-tions. The brief history of the lineage in the same book is a summary of Kongtrul's, which will soon be available in full in books two, three, and four of The Treasury of Knowledge. 93 THE SHANGPA TRADITION The story of the Shangpa literature itself of course does not actually reveal what the tradition represents. Through the centuries a distinctive body of practice has developed from these writings that I have been dis-cussing. This body of practice is far from a lost tradition, as some schol-ars have suggested. At this point in history, it might be said that more practitioners outside of Tibet have had extended retreat experiences of this tradition than any other, due mainly to the activities ofKalu Rin-poche. While it is impossible to do justice here to all of the teachings transmitted in this tradition, I will nevertheless attempt a brief over-view to provide a context for Niguma's writings and their importance in the lineage. Particular teachings will be presented more thoroughly in the translations later in the book. The teachings of Niguma and other Indian masters were received primarily by the Tibetan Khyungpo Naljor, \"Yogi of the Garuda Clan.\"94 All the texts that are attributed to Niguma were in fact written down by him. Khyungpo Naljor was born in a Tiger Year, probably"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"2.8 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion in the eleventh century, and is reputed to have lived for 150 years, an admittedly suspicious age.95 It is said that Khyungpo Naljor, like many other founders of lineages, went to India and Nepal to seek out the great teachers: Khyungpo Naljor, endowed with five culminations, received the entire dharma treasury-the quintessence of the heart-mind-of one hundred and fifty scholar-adepts. These in-clude four root gurus, thirteen especially exalted gurus, and two <;lakin is of timeless awareness, Niguma and Sukhasiddhi, who had heard the dharma directly from Buddha Vajra-dhara. Although this scholar-adept Khyungpo Naljor had progressively studied the [traditions of] Bon and Nyingma and attained accomplishment, the time had come for the [fulfillment of his previous] aspirations for enlightened ac-tivities, so he went in search of the profound teachings of siitra and tantra from the exalted country [ oflndia].96 The vast number of teachings he received could be classified into three areas: those of exegesis, debate, and practice. According to Jamgon Kongtrul and textual evidence, only the last of these, the area of prac-tice, has continued. However one might suggest that Stages in the Path of Illusion: The Commentary is an exception due to its exegetical char-acter. The teachings of these 150-plus gurus are reduced to five cycles by Kongtrul and others:· Thus, [Khyungpo] was the unique teacher in the Land of Snows who [provided] unlimited doorways to the dharma and was unrivaled in his enlightened activity. It is just unimaginable! Of all of these, it is only the quintessence of the heart of the last one-the stages of practice-that has lasted until the present day. This is known as the five dharma cycles that are the root of the golden dharmas of Niguma and Sukhasiddhi. That is, the five cycles ofNiguma, Sukhasiddhi, Vajrasana, Maitripa, and Rahula, along with various miscellaneous precepts.97"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Introduction .., 2.9 Khyungpo Naljor returned to Tibet and established his seat at Zhang-zhang in the Shang region of Western Tsang.98 Henceforth he was known as the Guru of Shang, and the holders of his lineage became known as the Shangpa Kagyu. It must be noted again that the Tibetan word \"kagyu\" (bka' brgyud) generically means \"lineage of Buddha's Word\" and is often applied to lineages other than the famous Kagyu tradition founded by Marpa the translator. The Shangpa Kagyu stands as an entirely separate lineage, though it may be argued that in mod-ern times it was swept into the political camp of the Karma Kagyu and shares some masters with that, and other, lineages. It is reputed that Khyungpo Naljor had eighteen thousand disci-ples,99 but in obedience to the specific injunction ofNiguma, her teach-ings were not spread openly for seven generations. This is known as a one-to-one lineage (gcig brgyud), and thus it passed from Khyungpo only to his last main disciple, Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsondrii (mo-1170), and thence sequentially to Wonton Kyergangpa (or Chokyi Senge, 1143-1216), Sangye Nyenton (or Rigongpa, 1175-1247/12SS?), and Drogon Sangye Tonpa (1207-1278). Sangye Tonpa was to be the seventh \"jewel,\" counting the first as Buddha Vajradhara, from whom it is said Niguma received the direct revelations. And so the vajra seal of the one-to-one lineage was lifted by Sangye Tonpa in the thirteenth century. \"Then;' says Kongtrul, \"the world of Jambudvipa and its sur-rounding islands were filled with his adept disciples.\"100 From that time, the stream of Niguma's teachings flowed out through many channels, often becoming known as specific lineages within the Shangpa, such as Jonang, Jakchen, Samding, and so forth.101 In addition, the continuing revelations of Niguma to later adepts in direct lineages added greatly to the streams of transmission and to the overall body of teachings. Though there are these many streams as well as different specialties and inherited teachings ( bka' babs), the tradition remains quite cohesive. Taranatha sums it up in this way: Although [Niguma's teachings] split into immeasurable dif-ferent kinds of lineages, due to the fact of being preserved in the <;lakini's Testimonial/02 neither the word nor the meaning have ever been compromised. Since it is therefore"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"30 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion unconttived and uncorrupted, it remains on the highest pinnacle of all practice lineages. This cycle of all ofNiguma's instructions in general maintains the perspective of all siitras and tantras. In particular, it is the heart of the ultimate teach-ings of the five tantra classes. Even more particularly, and extraordinarily, it is believed to have extracted the essence of the Sa?'{lvara Ocean and jewel Ocean [Tantras}.103 There are several arrangements of the progressive path of practicing these instructions, such as the extensive, abbreviated, and very abbre-viated.104 However, the framework of the Five Golden Dharmas of the Glorious Shangpa that was passed down in a one-to-one lineage has become the most renowned, while several other practices have become signature Shangpa practices. Here is the short list of those practices. THE FIVE GOLDEN DHARMAS These form the heart of the Shangpa spiritual practice and are so-called because of the enormous amount of gold that Khyungpo Naljor offered to receive them. They have been diagrammed in the mnemonic device of a living tree:1os The roots are the six dharmas The trunk is maharnudra The branches are the three integrations on the path The flowers are the white and red Khechari The fruit is immortal and infallible. Empowerment Niguma's original vajra lines come directly from the Buddha Vajra-dhara. Most of these are included in this collection and will be dis-cussed later. As Niguma points out in Vajra Lines of the Six Dharmas, 106 a practitioner must first receive tantric empowerment in order to become spiritually mature and able to best benefit from the practices. This is the usual and necessary preparation for all tantric practice. It"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Introduction .. 31 presupposes a deep connection with a guru or spiritual mentor who holds the specific lineage and is able to transmit it fully. The initiatory ceremony also involves the taking of pledges that in effect bind one to that preceptor in a sort of covenant (dam tshig; Skt. samaya). That relationship between the guru and disciple forms the working basis of practice. The primary empowerment required for this tradition comes from either the Five Tantras' Deities or from Chakrasaqwara}07 Preliminaries The preliminary practices originally seemed to consist of a single purif-icatory practice unique to the teachings of Niguma called \"The Puri-fier, Hollow Interior of A.\" Though barely mentioned in the Vajra Lines and in several early texts by Khyungpo Naljor, it is elaborated in greater detail by later contributors such as Taranatha.1081he practice involves visualizing and reciting the syllable \"A\" (pronounced \"ah\") as it moves through the central channel and throughout the whole body (the hol-low interiors) as purifying elixir, inseparable from the guru. It was tradi-tionally presented as the preliminary of the Six Oharmas, specifically of inner heat, 109 perhaps much the same way as the practice ofVajrayogini is said to prepare the subtle channels of the vajra body for the prac-tice of inner heat yoga. Later the tradition developed along the lines of other sects in maintaining a four-or fivefold preliminary practice commonly known as \"ngondro\" (sngon gro ).In that system, the hollow interior practice takes the place of the Vajrasattva mantra practice. The Roots: Six Dharmas These consist of the same practices as its better-known cousin, the Six Dharmas ofNaropa. Khyungpo Naljor received the six dharmas several times from Niguma, the first time in a dream from inside the belly of a demigod. In the Shangpa tradition, they are given in verse with their defining characteristics, which can be found in the text translated later: The path of methods [of inner heat)-naturally blazing bliss-warmth."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"32 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion Illusory body-naturally liberated desire and anger. Dream-naturally pure sleep-delusion. Lucid clarity-naturally clarified stupidity. Transference-buddhahood without meditation. Intermediate state-sarpbhogakaya of the victors.110 The Trunk: Amulet Mahdmudrd This is the particular name given to the Shangpa mahamudra tradition not by Niguma herself but because Khyungpo Naljor treasured these teachings so dearly that he wore them constantly in a sandalwood amu-let box around his neck. Concerning the more profound interpreta-tions of the name, Taranatha had this to say: \"Other explanations of the term such as that the 'jewel of the awareness mind is inserted in the amulet box of method and wisdom' are just utterly meaningless gossip.\"111 These are the instructions on the core meaning of mental non-engagement (yid Ia mi byed pa). This particular system is also called \"three naturally. settled states\" (rang babs rnam gsum) after the initial practice from Niguma of settling the body, speech, and mind in calm abiding and higher insight. Niguma's instructions are translated later in this book. The main practice is to become resolved about the nature of mind itself through the natural freedom from four faults, once that nature has been introduced. Khyungpo Naljor received this teaching from Maitripa.112 The final practice is to maintain the recognition that one's own ordinary mind is the three kayas of the buddha, as taught by Sukhasiddhi. Special enhancement practices are also associated with it.113 The Branches: Three Integrations In this practice all sights, sounds, and thoughts are understood to be the nature of the guru, yidam, and illusion. This understanding is inte-grated in life and in a matter of months or years, the three kayas natu-rally arise as clarity, emptiness, and great bliss.114 Niguma's instructions on this are translated later in the book."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Introduction .. 33 Ihe Flowers: White and Red Khechari These practices concern white and red forms ofVajrayogini. Khechari (Tib. mkha' spyod) means to engage in space, synonymous with the Tibetan word for c;lakini: khandroma (mkha' gro ma), \"she who moves in space.\" Though Khyungpo Naljor reportedly received these teach-ings from Niguma, the source of the Vajra Lines for White Khechari is attributed to Atisha Diparpkara Shrijiiana.115 The source text for Red Khechari includes the practice of transference to the Khechara realm at the time of death, instructions that are attributed to Lama Rahula.116 Transference teachings based on both c;lakinis were also transmitted directly to Tangtong Gyalpo by Niguma in his first vision of her, and his teachings on them are well known. The practice is summarized by Jamgon Kongtrul as follows: The Conqueror, the Vajra Queen, as the radiance of sun and moon, is aroused through special supplications and the vital points of visualization. The char.t#li (inner heat) of bliss-emptiness blazes up based on the release of passion at each of the chakras in the four places. Through those very supports, one comes to engage in the space of great unity.117 Ihe Fruit: Immortal and Infallible The instructions called \"Mind and Body, Immortal and Infallible\" are actually a combination of the precepts of the deathlessness of the mind that were transmitted to Khyungpo Naljor by Niguma, translated later in this book, and the instructions on the infallible nature of the body that are attributed to Viriipa. Essentially, mind is immortal because it is unborn. The body is merely inert matter and therefore death and other such designations are irrelevant. The realization of immortal body is achieved through thirty-two yogic practices."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"34 .. Niguma, Lady oflllusion OTHER SHANGPA PRACTICES Six Dharmas ofSukhasiddhi The other principal female guru ofKhyungpo Naljor was Sukhasiddhi, another 4akini of timeless awareness. The tradition tells the intriguing story of her transformation from a sixty-year old housewife whose gen-erosity to a beggar caused her expulsion from her home, to a stunning sixteen-year-old devotee of the beer-guzzling adept Vinipa.118 She too had direct access to the Buddha as Vajradhara. Of the teachings that Khyungpo Naljor received from her, only the most profound Six Dhar-mas and the Mahamudra precepts of pure timeless awareness remain. These more or less parallel the similarly named practices of Niguma, though both systems are practiced separately by modern-day Shangpa practitioners. Five Tantras' Deities Khyungpo Naljor received the transmission in these five tantras many times, first individually from Vairochanaralqhita,u9 and then as a com-bined practice from Vajrasana, his principal male guru.120 He also received the empowerments from Niguma and later in Tibet from Lama Rahula.121 The Indian Source Text of the Glorious Five Tantras is by Vajrasana, 122 but this special practice of visualizing the five tantric deities in the five chakras of one's body is said to be originally from jewel Ocean Tantra, a major source of many Shangpa doctrines.123 It is often said that Khyungpo fully realized the five tantric deities in the five chakras of his body and even appeared to his disciple Mokchokpa in the company of those deities. The practice holds a special significance in the Shangpa tradition for this reason and also, no doubt, because it conveniently combines five of the most complex and weighty tantras in a single prac-tice. According to Taranatha, the six dharmas are the essence of these five tantras.124 Kongtrul connects them with other important practices as follows: Hevajra is the culmination ofinner heat; Chakrasaqwara is the culmination of action mudra; Guhyasamaja is the culmination of illusory body and luminous clarity; Mahamaya is the culmination of dream; and Vajrabhairava is the culmination of enlightened activity.'\""},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Introduction • 35 In the sadhana itself, Vajrasana describes the practice as \"the essence of all tantras gathered into one.\" 1he Five Deities ojChakrasa1!Jvara Niguma's texts translated later in this book cite the Sarrtvara Ocean Tan-tra as the source of this tradition. Niguma imparted certain versions of the Chakrasai)1vara, especially the completion phase, to Khyungpo in their initial encounter and, like the mahamudra instructions, he kept them in the amulet around his neck. He also received the full prac-tice shortly thereafter from a certain Hidden Yogin. 1261he practice text attributed to Niguma translated here is quite remarkable and consid-erably different than the one found in the later Shangpa tradition. The more usual visualization, such as that found in Kalu Rinpoche's daily practice,127 involves ChakrasaJ!1vara with Vajrayogini as the central dei-ties in union surrounded by four 4akinis. There is also a practice of visualizing just the 4akinis without Chak-rasai)1vara called Five l)dkinis (mkha' gro sde lnga) in the Shangpa lin-eage. The relevant texts of this were arranged by Kongtrul, drawing on !aranatha's Mine of jewels, and seem not to date earlier than that, though it is described as an esoteric instruction of Khyungpo Naljor, received directly from the five 4akinis themselves and in turn from the Lion-faced 4ilini.128 1he Four Deities Combined In the seeming fondness for simplifying practices, this creation phase practice groups four beloved deities into one visualization: Six-armed Mahakala, Vajrayogini, Avalokiteshvara, and Green Tara, with one's guru as Vajradhara in the center. Thus it is considered a kind of guru yoga, bringing the practitioner's mind into union with that of the guru in many forms. Kongtrul explains in his guidance manual to this prac-tice that these four deities first actually appeared to the great adept Shavari129and then were codified in a practice manual by Maitripa. Khyungpo Naljor apparently heard it from him, and it became known as the Blessing of Constant Four Deities.130 However, the main source"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"36 .. Niguma, Lady of illusion for this current transmission was again Lama Rahula. After receiving it from him in Tibet, Khyungpo Naljor could be seen by his fortunate disciples actually manifesting as these four deities. There is also a prac-tice of the four deities individually (lha bzhi't sgos sgrub ). Six-Armed Mahdkala, \"Chakdrukpa\" The special dharma protector of the lineage is six-armed Mahakala, or the Swift Protector of Timeless Awareness, a wrathful emanation of Avalokiteshvara. The particular iconography of the protector is distin-guished from the Gelukpa counterpart by having the right foot bent up at the ankle, rather than bent at the knee. There is also a peaceful, white Chakdrukpa specializing in prosperity. Khyungpo Naljor received these practices and empowerments from Maitripa in the Shavari line and from Rahula in the Atayavajra line.131 This wisdom protector also serves in the most treasured guru yoga practice called Dwelling in the Heart, where guru and protector are inseparable.132 Taranatha wrote a \"biography\" of Chakdrukpa and a history of the transmission that is found in the Golden Rosary ofShangpa Biographies after those of all the lineage lamas.133 Maitripa's own story and explanation of the protector as told by him to Khyungpo Naljor is included in the latter's biography. Extraordinary Practices There are certain practices unique to the Shangpa tradition that have been passed down orally through the lineage and have historically been closely guarded. On his third trip to the West in 1977-1978, the late head of the lineage, Khyabje Kalu Rinpoche, decided the time was right to spread one of these practices. It is called Uncommon Calm Abiding and Higher Insight (thun mon ma yin pa'i zhi gnas lhag mthong). In addition to the common practices of calm abiding and higher insight, such as those found in the Karma Kagyu tradition, this version employs special visualizations involving abstract forms of the elements and the aggregates. In some sense they might be called the vajrayana version of calm abiding and higher insight. Instructions are not found in the col-lections, but were spread far and wide by Kalu Rinpoche.1.H"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path oflllusion 1 INTRODUCTION NIGUMA AS the embodiment of illusion may be a distinctive and fascinating twist, but her emphasis on teaching illusion is at least as old as the Buddha. In siitras and tantras beyond count the Buddha spoke of the illusory nature of all perceived phenomena, primarily as a way to cut through attachment. In the earliest sermons, a primary focus was in explaining the lack of intrinsic, findable existence in the person as an individual as well as in all other phenomena. Later this developed into the full-blown doctrine of emptiness (funyatd), based on mahayana siitras known collectively as the perfection of wisdom (prajndpdramitd). The philosophy based on those siitras, madhyamaka, refuted every aspect of existence and nonexistence. Through the rigors oflogic and reasoning, when followed to their conclusion, it is discov-ered that there can be no conclusion, and that things cannot be found. This approach, however, may not imbue the logician with the visceral experience of phenomena that may well be empty and yet undeniably appear clearly. How can one understand such an idea that is ultimately ineffable, a concept beyond conceptual mind? THE MAGIC The Buddha apparently thought that providing illustrations would be a way in to this mystery, a way to get a handle on it through the imag-ing mind rather than just through the intellect. This is why one finds"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"38 • Niguma, Lady of Illusion discussion of examples or similes of illusion almost as much as discus-sion of emptiness itself and its integral ideas of contingency and imper-manence. The two most common images an; dream and illusion since both provide excellent metaphors of our general condition. Dream especially is considered a fortunate fact of human life. How else could we understand our range of reactive emotions to ultimately unreal events if we had not experienced them all in dreams? There are well-known lists of eight, ten, and twelve similes of illu-sion, although there is considerable variation. A typical list of the eight examples of illusion consists of (1) dreams, (2) illusions, (3) hallucina-tions, (4) mirages, (s) moon reflected in water, (6) echoes, (7) fairy cities, and ( 8) emanations or projections. If extended to twelve, the most commonly added are (9) water bubbles, (10) lightning, (u) mir-ror reflections, and of course (12) rainbows, which were discussed in the introduction.• Further examples are eye disease, wheels made by a whirling fire brand, the reflection of trees in water, perceived hair-nets, water whirling about in a mirage, dim-eyed people in the dark, a corpse animated by a ghost, machines, douds, stars, mirages in the air, reflec-tions in the eyes, a barren woman's child, and many more. The popular Diamond Sutra, for instance, states: As stars, blurred vision, candles, illusions, dew, bubbles, dreams, lightning, and douds; so should all that is conditioned be seen.2 The term being translated as \"illusion\" is mdyd in Pa.li and Sanskrit. It appears as an item in all versions of the lists, as well as being the over-all concept that each example is illustrating. As a specific term, \"maya\" has a history of its own. In its earliest usage it seems to be precisely \"deceit.\" For instance, in 1he Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga), a comprehensive summary of the doctrine and practice of the Pali canon by the fifth-century Indian Buddhaghosa, it appears only as one of the many traits of a person of\"greedy temperament;' and as one of an even larger number of flaws that must be overcome for someone to be called \"blessed\" (bhagavd).3"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion ~ 39 Another interesting occurrence early on is in the name of the Bud-dha's mother, Queen Maya. It would be tempting to draw some pro-found conclusions about the nature of women and the doctrine of illusoriness, but that must be a later doctrine as there is little evidence of it here. Rather, it seems to be a pleasant twist on its meaning as \"deceit\" in the sense of the beguiling charm that robs men of their good sense, like many such names for women! The Sutra of the Vast Display (Lali-tavistara) on the life of the Buddha, says: Ravishing the heart like a magical creation, she is called Mayadevi, Goddess oflllusion.5 There is a particular sense that developed from the term \"maya\" as deceit, which is evident in the lists of types of illusion: the idea of a magic show that is intentionally created by an illusionist. It has been variously translated as \"mock show,\" \"apparition,\" \"magic show,\" \"wiz-ardry,\" \"enchantment,\" \"wonderment,\" and so on. Maya was translated into Tibetan as sgyu ma, {from sgyu, \"deceit\"). This in itself can mean the illusionist as well as the illusion that he or she creates, though to be more specific the texts will use sgyu ma mkhan for the illusionist. The story is often told in the si\"mas of a magician who uses sticks and stones to create an apparition, such as this one narrated in the Sutra That Unravels the Intent (Samdhinirmocana): Child of good lineage, for example, a magician (sgyu ma mkhan) or a magician's able student, standing at the cross-ing of four great roads, after gathering grasses, leaves, twigs, pebbles or stones, displays various magical forms, such as a herd of elephants, a cavalry, chariots, and infantry; collec-tions of gems, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch-shells, crystal, and coral; collections of wealth, grain, treasuries, and granaries. When those sentient beings who have childish natures, foolish natures, or confused natures-who do not realize that these are grasses, leaves, twigs, pebbles and stones-see or hear these things, they think: 'This herd of elephants that appears, exists; these cavalry, chariots, infantry, gems, pearls,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"40 • Niguma, Lady of illusion lapis lazuli, conch-shells, crystal, coral, wealth, grain, trea-suries, and granaries that appear, exist.6 The modern reader might feel a sense of incredulity that there were apparently magicians in ancient India who could produce such illu-sions and people who actually believed them, at least until they dis-covered the pebbles and sticks. Few people these days are fooled by magic shows, and so this may seem like an obscure example and an out-dated simile. At the same time, few people believe that motion pictures are real, and yet the theater can be full oflaughing, crying, or scream-ing people covering their eyes. Sometimes they have to purposefully remember that it is \"only a movie.\" The metaphorical value of a movie is the same as that of a magic show. Maya in particular is an example of an illusion that is purposefully created, unlike the natural phenomena of the other similes, such as rainbows and mirages. This is an apt metaphor, then, for mind-the illusionist-that under the influence of habitual cognitive and emo-tional obscurations perceives reality as solid entities permanently fixed in their status as good, bad, or neutral, despite all evidence to the con-trary. There is almost a sense of purposefulness in this creation of the magic show and then an intentional ignoring ofits illusory status. One wants to believe in the show and wills it to be real-to provide enter-tainment, to corroborate emotional response, and to verify one's very existence. The original Indian idea was that we are duped by maya. The whole display of our senses has tricked us into believing it and thus seduces us into the world of suffering. And the illusionist is that old trickster, one's own mind. But when this illusory nature is recognized to be just that, one is released from the bondage of the magic show, at which time it becomes a wonderful spectacle, even a display of the unimpeded cre-ativity and freedom of mind. Then maya itself is both the medium for this realization and the expression ofit. This conscious and intentional method of relating to all phenomena as illusion is thus cast in a totally positive light on the spiritual path, a complete turn-around from the original negative valuation of it as deceit. Now illusion is seen as illu· mination and opportunity.

Aryadeva says: Since everything is an illusory display, it is possible to attain enlightenment.7 The transformation of the maya concept from something to escape to something to engage may be loosely correlated with the shift of empha-sis on understanding emptiness that emerged in the mahayana teach-ings. A further development may be seen in the vajrayana teachings with the esoteric instruction known as Illusory Body (sgyu Ius). This occurs as one of the Six Dharmas ofNiguma and in other configura-tions of completion stage practices in many lineages. According to Jamgon Kongtrul, there are four levels ofillusory body practice. 8 (I) The literal practice is simply to understand all phenomena as the embodiment of illusion. (:z.) The general practice of illusory body is a more specific application of the similes in meditation to develop the understanding that all appearances lack true existence despite their appearance as real. In classical vajrayana methodology, this will involve seeing oneself and the environment as deities in the mandala, still in conjunction with the eight or twelve similes. This is called the special or pure illusory body in the general sense. (3) The hidden sense of illusory body is the application in completion phase yoga of the realizations from the previous practices. This involves the dissolution of the energy currents (praT)a) in the central channel and, ultimately, the appearance of a divine form based only on energy current and mind. This is the true goal of illusory body practice in the context of the six dharmas. (4) The ultimate illusory body is the same as the rainbow body and has already been discussed in the context ofNiguma's level of attainment. This range-and change-of the meaningofillusion is also expressed simply as illusion that is \"impure\" and \"pure;\" or \"false\" and \"genuine.\" Thus the great Nyingma master Longchen Rabjam (1301-I363), in the commentary to his famous Natural Ease in Illusion, says: All dharmas of samsara, appearing to the mind, develop from the force ofhabitual propensity of the mind. Therefore"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"42. .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion that is called \"erroneously conceived illusion.\" All dharmas of nirvana, appearing to timeless awareness, are the Bodies of the natural radiance of intrinsic a~areness and appear-ances of timeless awareness; a spontaneous presence that is beyond things and characteristics of dharmas. Therefore that is called \"genuine illusion.\"9 Longchenpa's text bears many resemblances to Niguma's treatise, Stages in the Path of Illusion. Indeed the autocommentaries to both works cite so many of the same sources that it seems either that one copied from the other (and if chronology and authorship are true, that would mean Longchenpa copied from Niguma), or that they both utilized the same earlier Indian sources. However, their general approach is quite dif-ferent. Longchenpa's work is one of a trilogy, 10 each volume offering a method to rest and restore the mind: in the nature of mind itself, in meditative stability, or in illusion. In the latter, he discusses at length the application of practice through each of the eight similes of illu-sion. Each of the eight is further correlated with the eight qualities of dependently arisen phenomena mentioned in Nagarjuna's famous opening verse in his Root Verses of the Middle. 11 Niguma's treatise, on the other hand, speaks only of illusion as the over-all theory of illusion, which at the same time implies the one example of the magic show. She then shows how one must engage this perspective step by step to travel the bodhisattva path to enlighten-ment. STAGES OF THE PATH Stages in the Path of Illusion and its Commentary do not pursue the hid-den or ultimate levels of illusory body except for the occasional verses. Niguma leaves this for the actual practice of illusory body in the con-text of the Six Dharmas. Rather, Stages in the Path of Illusion applies the attitude of realization indicated by Kongtrul's first and second levels of illusory body to the complexities of the bodhisattva's spiritual journey: the factors of enlightenment, perfections, paths, and grounds. The idea of\"path\" (mtirga, Tib.lam) is as central and ubiquitous in"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. 43 Buddhism as the concept of emptiness. The multileveled structure of the spiritual journey may even seem ironic in light of those teachings on emptiness. Yet as soon as a goal was identified-freedom from suf-fering-then some way to get there from here had to be identified. The path theory has prominence of place in one of the earliest formulations of the Buddha: the four noble truths. There is suffering, it has a cause, removing the cause will eliminate the suffering, and there is a way to do that: \"the path.\" The Buddhist path describes a journey from the bond-age of ignorance to the freedom of complete awakening. Every teach-ing to be practiced that is attributed to the Buddha or to enlightened beings of all times and in all directions makes up the path. One could say that it is a synonym of\" buddhadharma.\" It is not just a random grab bag of methods (though at times it certainly seems so) but is presented as an enlightened and exact formula of spiritual practice and patterns of behavior that progressively remove the factors that obstruct prog-ress and develop the powers one needs to traverse the path to its end. Even though one might say that to wake up from the sleep of ignorance could happen in an instant, there is a gradual journey of many moments to get to that instant. And even though one might say that to reach the goal is to arrive at the starting point and know the place for the first time, there is still the attempt to impose a linear order onto the circular journey, to make sense of it. To ask \"how far?\" The Buddha's teaching of the path to awakening is predicated on the one fact accepted by all Buddhists: that he himself had traveled it and was describing it from the vantage point of its destination. \"This is how I got here, and therefore you could get here by that same route.\" Details of the path, in fact, seem to be originally based on the litera-ture concerning the previous lives of the Buddha, in the same way that the ideal Buddhist aspirant is based on the Buddha as arhant and later on the Buddha in his former life as bodhisattva.12 As the path descrip-tions grew-and grow they did, into what appears now as more of a maze than a road-two functions can be discerned: to be a source of faith and a source of guidance. The path is both descriptive (of what the Buddha, or any idealized person, did), and prescriptive (of what their followers should do). Distinguishing these two functions may help to understand the intimidating amount of material about the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion path. Sometimes, as in the most inclusive tripartite path description of ethical discipline (fila), meditative absorption (samddhi), and wis-dom or intelligence (prajnd), one can engage it as advice and undertake any number of practices that fall under those three headings to lead a wholesome life that tends toward spiritual development. Sometimes, as in the descriptions of even the first ground (bhumi) of the bodhisattva, where one is capable of feats such as visiting a hundred buddha realms, one should perhaps simply appreciate that there are great beings with such powers. Because, as Donald Lopez puts it: That path was increasingly seen as more and more protracted, encompassing lifetimes of practice, finally reaching, in the Mahayana, the generally accepted length of three periods of innumerable aeons (which Har Dayal has kindly calculated for us at 384 x 1058 years).13 Finding one's way through the intricacies of path literature is no task for the timid. It has been the occupation of scholars since the begin-ning, all trying to make sense of it while adding lists upon lists. There is no point in repeating all of that here, as it would be, indeed, all of the buddhadharma. There are several recent publications that will provide readers with more than they will ever need to know.14 But the subjects ofNiguma's texts deserve at least brief mention. These subjects combine four enumerations that appear to have developed somewhat organically along separate lines and in various texts, and were later merged into one comprehensive map painstakingly configured by mahayana scholars (who were apparently unaware of the emptiness of categories). The basis of it all should be mentioned first as the starting place of the path. This refers to the idea of an underlying stratum or foundation that supports all aspects of mind and perception, and so is termed lit-erally the ground of everything or all-base (dlaya, Tib. kun gzhi). The concept of all-base was articulated in the yogachara philosophy devd-oped primarily by Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu based on stltras of the third turning of the wheel of dharma. Although not posited as a \"self\" or existent entity, it nevertheless is used in attempts to explain"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path ofiUusion • 45 the continuity of karmic actions and as such is sometimes translated as \"storehouse.\" It is a neutral base or ground on which everything occurs. It is the ground of timeless awareness and at the same time the basis of delusion, in which aspect it is known as \"all-ground consciousness.\" As such, it is the base of an eightfold scheme of consciousness used by yogacharins to describe human experience. There is an enormous range of interpretation of all-base; Niguma's version in her Commentary fol-lows the classical yogachara description with a leaning toward what later became known as an \"other-emptiness\" viewpoint. In Niguma's teaching, it is the illusory basis upon which the illusory path proceeds to reach the illusory goal of realizing the illusoriness of that basis. The thirty-seven factors or dharmas that are conducive to or con-cordant with awakening seem to have very early beginnings. They are mentioned throughout the early siitras and in the abhidharma and are explained at length in The Path ofPurijication.•s The list includes some very well-known concepts such as the eightfold path of the noble ones and the four foundations of mindfulness. They are as follows: Four foundations of mindfulness (1-4-), four renunciations (s-8), four sup-ports for miraculous activity (9-12), five faculties (13-17 ), five powers (18-22), seven branches of enlightenment (23-29), and the eightfold path of the noble ones (30-3 7 ). This represents just a slight shift of the progressive list in the theravadin tradition, where the eightfold path is listed before the seven branches of enlightenment. The five paths (pancamdrga; Tib. lam lnga) are also an early develop-ment. They emerged as the predominant schema from among wliat Kongtrul calls \"limitless classifications\"; ways of dividing up the basic Buddhist path-theory!6 \"The Sanskrit word \"marga\" (path) derives from the verbal root mdrg (to seek; to search; to strive to attain; to go) and has a wide range of meanings, such as \"way; \"tracks\" (of wild ani-1 ) \" \" \" \" \"ch I\"\" \" \" h\" \"· · \" \" ma s , passage, course, anne , range, searc , mquuy, man-ner,\" \"method,\" \"practice,\" and, specifically, \"the way or path pointed out by Buddha for escape from the misery of existence.\"17 Kongtrul explains that the \"essence of' path' (that on which one progresses) is that, through having entered it, it serves as a stepping-stone for progressing"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"46 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion toward more superior mundane or supramundane states.\"18 Niguma's own verse on the matter defines it as follows: Since calm abiding and higher insight are combined together, and since it is supreme, and one desires to arrive, it is called \"path.\"19 And the commentary elaborates: The essence of the path is that it is the way of combining calm abiding and higher insight. The literal definition is that since one desires to arrive at supreme enlightenment it is called \"path.\" The divisions are the path of accumulation, the path of joining, the path of seeing, the path of medita-tion, and the path of consummation.20 The ten {or so) grounds can be found in various enumerations in the scriptures. 21 The earliest mention of ten grounds may be theMahdvastu, a compilation of stories and traditions about the Buddha.22 There the ten grounds or levels ( bhitmi; Tib. sa) occur in the context of the Bud-dha's previous life as the bodhisattva. This represents a pre-mahayana formulation and may or may not be the source of later classifications, as the ten mentioned in the Mahdvastu do not bear the same names as those of the later standardized lists found in mahayana sii.tras such as the Sittra on the Ten Ground? and in treatises such as the Bodhi-sattva Grounds24 composed in Sanskrit in the late fourth century by Asati.ga.ln fact, in the Entry into the Middle Jiliay, another classical trea-tise devoted to the subject, Chandrakirti declares that the scheme is peculiar to the mahayana tenets. 2s The most commonly studied author-itative text on the matter is Maitreya's commentary on the perfection of wisdom, The Ornament of Clear Realization. 26 The Sanskrit word \"bhii.mi\" has several definitions depending on which etymology it is given.27 In Tibetan it was translated as \"sa,\" mean-ing literally \"ground\" and by connotation \"level\" or \"stage.\" In her com-mentary to the following verses in Stages in the Path, Niguma states"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion \"' 47 simply, \"The literal definition is that since they are the support for all qualities or the basis for progressing higher they are called 'grounds:\" The combined calm abiding and higher insight that transcends the mundane as unfixated naturally arisen illusion is nonconceptual timeless awareness. Being the foundation of the pure qualities, and [because] one progresses higher, they are called \"grounds.\" The divisions are Very Joyful and so on, with ten early signs that one should know. 28 These verses also serve to remind us that the development of calm abid-ing and higher insight is, in short, the Buddhist path. The names for the ten grounds that have become standardized (though not in Eng-lish translation!) in the mahayana are: Very Joyful, Stainless, Illuminat-ing, Radiant, Difficult to Overcome, Manifest, Gone Far, Immovable, Excellent Intelligence, and Cloud ofDharma. The tenth ground, Cloud of Dharma, was traditionally equated with buddhahood, but as dis-cussed earlier, there has been a tendency to add further and further lev-els in the vajrayana tradition-now up to fourteen. The six or ten perfections refer to qualities that a bodhisattva practices and develops on the path and ultimately \"perfects.\" Thus there is both a sense of path and of fruition. In later Pali texts a list of ten such perfec-tions (Pali: pdrami) were added to the canon, possibly as a retroactive addition from the mahayana.29 They differ slightly from the mahayana list and include two of the four immeasurables: love and equanimity.30 In the mahayana, the formula of the six perfections \"was evolved after a process of selection and experimentation.\"31 The list is found through-out Sanskrit literature and makes up the main path of the bodhisattva once the thought of enlightenment has been aroused. In that sense it is comparable to the eightfold path of the noble ones in early teachings of the Buddha. The Sanskrit term pdramitd was translated into Tibetan"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"48 .. Niguma, Lady of ILLusion as pha rol tu phyin pa, meaning literally \"to arrive over there,\" which was perhaps suggested by the addition of the term \"ita\" (gone to the beyond). There are many variables, however, and there has been much discussion about the actual meaning and deri~ation of the term.32 Con-sequently, there does not seem to be any adequate English translation to capture the full range of meaning, and one has to fall back on the deficient but easy term \"perfection.\" Other options are \"transcendent action,\" \"transcendental virtue,\" highest perfection,\" and \"complete attainment.\" With some overlap of the earlier list, the six paramitas are generosity, ethical discipline, patience, diligence, meditative stability, and wisdom. A common way to understand the six perfections in terms of the path and its result is to regard the regular practice of the first five-generos-ity and so on-as the actions that the aspiring bodhisattva must prac-tice. When the sixth-the perfection of wisdom-is applied to those first five, then those practices become truly \"transcendent\" or \"perfect\" and are the actual fruitional qualities possessed by a noble bodhisattva, which is to say, one who traverses the bhiimis. Kongtrul also states that the six paramitas bring about the unfolding of the modes of the ten bhiimis according to the ways of engaging cognition. 33 At some point four more paramitas were added to the list: skill in methods, aspirations, power, and timeless awareness. These four are obviously associated mainly with the higher levels of fruition. A mar-riage of numerical harmony was destined for these two lists of ten, the paramitas and the bhiimis, which might not have been an accident. In the Sutra on the Ten Grounds, the ten paramitas are correlated one-to-one with the ten grounds. The common scheme of six perfections was perhaps expanded to ten precisely for this purpose.31 ALL OF THE ABOVE Thus begins the intricate process of spiritual cartography and match-making that occupies much of the mahayana literature. The thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening are lined up alongside a steady progres-sion in the first three paths, the ten grounds are grafted on to the five paths beginning with the onset of the third path, and the perfections"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. 49 are perfected in a steady sequence on the grounds. The whole map is fine-tuned even further by adding subcategories and levels within each of the five paths; thus there are the lesser, intermediate, and greater lev-els of the Path of Accumulation, and so forth. It is unfortunate that the ancient writings did not include charts, such as the one presented on pages 52.-53,3' which make the path-map easier to visualize. WHY AND WHEREFORE? As the subject progresses in complexity, the question constantly arises \"to what end?\" Although one might master the correlations of the chart, how does one actually apply the information to one's own path? For if one cannot do that, it certainly seems to be an exercise in frustration.36 The idea is often presented that the complexity of the proposed path, reflects the complexity of the defilements that it purports to purify.37 This sounds true but still begs the question whether knowledge of such minutiae actually aids the purification process or confounds it. Cer-tainly examination of defilements is de rigueur for Buddhists. Yet how important is it to identify and even name the process and one's location in a sort of Buddhist GPS? The question is especially pertinent given that the mahayana list in particular seems to be referencing something we can only hope to achieve, even at the very initial stages. The process of trying to apply the categories to oneself and one's own journey seems fraught with the dangers of straying into error, developing arrogance, and just plain wasting time. As I suggested before, one can gain the benefit only if one distin-guishes those aspects that are meant to be applied as personal prac-tices now, \"starting from where you are,\" and those that might inspire confidence in and credulity toward great spiritual beings. In suggesting these two modes of understanding the topic, I am not saying that the inherent ability of all beings to attain buddhahood is in doubt. I am just seeking a way through the maze of endlessly proliferating path-categories toward the exit light of what must somehow be edifying knowledge. Here is another, perhaps similar, way elaborated by Robert E. Buswell, Jr. and Robert M. Gimello in the foreword to their collec-tion Paths to Liberation:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"so .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion It may well be that the persistent Buddhist tendency to elaborate on the path by dividing it into multiple and fur-ther subdivisible stages, although perhaps begun as a kind of\"cartography\" of the terrain of Buddhist religious experi-· ence, led retrospectively to creation of a spiritual pedigree for the ideal person such as might render that person worthy of emulation by others. Thus the process of marga construc-tion, whereby the path is built step by step, may be said to define a necessary stage in the evolutions of a tradition, viz., the stage of transition from the category of the particular, the idiosyncratic, or the biographical to the category of the universal and the generic. In this way the experience of one person is made accessible, in principle, to all. By organizing experience into sequences of stages, the transcendent goal presumed to have been achieved by spiritual exemplars at the source of the tradition is objectified, codified, and made available to ordinary Buddhist practitioners. The detailed ordering of experience that these schemata of the path pro-vide offers practitioners an explicit guide to achieving the original and archetypal goal for themselves. The path thus mediates between the enlightened and the unenlightened.38 NOTHING TO GET HUNG ABOUT And if that doesn't work, well, you might try viewing the path as illusion. This would not be a new concept. As mentioned before, the simile of illusion covers everything and has been used to qualify the Buddhist path specifically at least since the appearance of the perfection of wis-dom s\\mas. For example, in the Perfection oJWisdom in Eight-thousand Lines, the dream/illusion simile is used to describe the four stages on the path of the arhants, as well as of pratyekabuddhas and buddhas: Children of gods, all dharmas are like illusion, like dream. Stream-winning is also like illusion, like dream. The fruition of stream-winning is also like illusion, like dream. In the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. SI same way once-returning and coming back with its fruition, nonreturning and its fruition, and arhants are also like illu-sion, like dream. Arhanthood itself is also like illusion, like dream. Pratyekabuddhas are also like illusion, like dream. Pratekyabuddhahood itself is also like illusion, like dream. Genuine complete buddhas are also like illusion, like dream. Genuine complete buddhahood is also like illusion, like dream.39 In the commentary to the Stages in the Path of Illusion, Niguma cites a similar passage in the Perfection ofWisdom in Eighteen Thousand Lines that names all thirty-seven factors of enlightenment as being like illu-sions and dreams. But what is the point of analyzing the path down to its tiniest track if anyway it is just illusion? Ulusion gives us the perfect metaphor to make sense of the reality of emptiness and appearance; of primordially present awake awareness and an impossibly protracted path to enlightenment. In a way it is the naming of the area between paradoxes, of the creative space in the ten-sion of opposites. The path makes sense only on the level of illusion: a journey that must be negotiated, carefully and with determination, but treading lightly and lightheartedly without becoming trapped in the doldrums of believing in it. The path and its fruition exist only as illusion, but without that marvel there is no path and no fruition. Then you are stuck. The difference between being stuck in samsara and free in nirvana is only the illusory journey on the illusory path. Careful, lest it disappear or solidify."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"S1 ..

There is no other realization than this in the five paths and twelve grounds."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"88 .. Niguma, Lady oj1llusion The meaning of base and its inherent fruition are inseparable in profundity and breadth.74 What does that mean? [Primordial] unity is ascertained in the abiding base just as it is, the practice of unity is the path that is the nature of method, and actualized unity arises naturally as the result. II. The Base Regarding [primordial) unity as the base just as it is, there is the all-base and the four empowerments. A. The All-Base What does it mean to say \"the abiding base just as it is\"? [It refers to] the all-base consciousness, the afflictive mentation, the mental conscious-ness, and the five sense consciousnesses. 1. All-Base Consciousness To classify that all-base consciousness further, there is the all-base as indeterminate awareness, the all-base as the seed of everything, the all-base where latent habitual patterns ripen, and how the all-base con-sciousness is presented. a. All-Base Consciousness as Indeterminate Lucid Empty Pure Awareness The Fully Illuminated Essence Sutra states: The all-base that is lucid, empty pure awareness is known as indeterminate.75 That lucid, empty all-base is neither one nor many, but rather a unity. In the Stainless Essence Sutra it says:"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion • 89 All-base, lucid, empty, indeterminate, being neither one nor many, is the unity of empty and nonempty. At that time it is the seed of all phenomena.76 When the lucid, empty awareness is covered by the latent habitual pat-terns of karma, it is like the example of the waxing and waning moon. The all-base revolves in the constituent of sentient beings, but since it is without increase or decrease, it is naturally lucid clarity. It says in the Dense Array of Adornments: This all-base of embodied beings is covered by the habitual patterns of karma. Like the light of the full moon that illuminates millions of realms, and hovers around the Supreme Mountain, [yet it is] not destructible like real objects. Likewise mind and consciousness and mentation certainly revolve around the constituent of sentient beings [but do not increase or diminish it]. It is always light by nature.77 b. All-Base as the Seed of Everything Virtuous, nonvirtuous and indeterminate latent habitual patterns accu-mulate upon the all-base and become seeds. From the same source: All-base that is constituted by various forms711 is the abode of all consciousness. The all-base with its latent habitual patterns is the seed of everything.79 From that, the seeds of previous habitual patterns give rise to subse-quent ones, as stated in Illuminated Essence:"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"90 • Niguma, Lady of Illusion Since the previous latent habitual patterns give birth to sub-sequent ones, it is the \"seed.\"80 How did those latent habitual patterns accrirnulate? Dense Array [tif Adornments] explains: Immature beings impute samsaric forms that are without beginning in that realm. Negative tendencies and karmic conditions accumulate latent habitual patterns beginninglessly.S1 How do these two-the beginningless all-base and the latent habitual patterns-cohabit? The Fully Illuminated Essence states: Just as gold is to tarnish, the all-base is to habitual patterns. Also it is like river stones and algae, as stated in Adornments: Just as the stones in the depths of the water are completely enwrapped with algae, so the all-base consciousness is said to be stained by latent habitual patterns.82 c. All-Base Is Where Latent Habitual Patterns Ripen The subde habitual patterns of virtue, nonvirtue, and neutrality that are overlaid on the all-base ripen from subde into grosser [patterns] and then fully ripen into each of the six kinds [of ordinary beings]. It says in the Fully Illuminated Essence: Virtue, nonvirtue, and in between; habitual patterns ripen into six kinds of cycling beings."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. 91 d. How All-Base Consciousness Is Presented All-base is fully conscious in its empty-clarity, the nature oflight. From [this] aspect of pure awareness,83 it is called \"all-base consciousness.\" It states in Sections on Grounds:84 The clarity of all-base consciousness is fully conscious as nonconceptual consciousness. Consciousness itself in its clarity is without concept.85 All-base consciousness does not conceive of external objects that are truly existent. Therefore, the scope of its frame of reference is unlim-ited. Moreover, since it becomes the basic support of all samsara and nirvana, it is not differentiated from total perfection (rnam byang). As it says in Adornments: No different than total perfection, all-base cannot be differentiated. If it could be differentiated then all-base would not be permanent.86 And in Illuminated Essence: Since the all-base becomes the base of everything, it is therefore the base of total perfection. Other si\"mas iterate this as well. In them, the basic space of beginning-less time is called \"the base constituent\" (gzhi khams ). It says in the journey to Lanka:~n The basic space of beginningless time is the base of all phenomena. Because that exists, all beings will attain nirvana."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"9 2. .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion Again, the all-base or buddha nature (bde bar gshegs pa'i snyingpo, suga-tagarbha) is described in the Highest Continuum: The (buddha nature] constituent is one that is beginningless. Because that exists, all beings will attain nirvana.88 And again, in Adornments, the all-base or buddha nature is described thus: The base of all the various grounds is buddha nature; virtue is also that. That nature is also termed all-base, which was taught by the tathagata. But feeble-minded people do not understand [buddha] nature known as the all-base.89 It is also called \"the appropriating consciousness,\"90 \"base of the body,\" \"base of all; and \"mind support; as in the Sections on Grounds: That consciousness thus grasps this body and takes posses-sion of it and then it is also called \"the appropriating con-sciousness.\" Since it has become the base of this body, it is called \"all-base.\" Since it is indeterminate it is also called \"a sentient being\" because all the consciousnesses come about based on that.91 There are limitless synonyms given in the siitras, such as beginning-less time (thog ma med pa'i dus), pure awareness (rig pa), basic space (dbyings), constituent (khams), all-base (kun gzhi), suchness (de bzhin nyid), realm of phenomena (chos dbying, dharmadhatu), heart (snying po ), the body of dharma ( chos sku, dharmakdya ), unborn (ma skyes pa ), all-base consciousness (kun gzhi'i rnam shes), the base support pervad-ing sentient beings (sems can kun khyab gzhi rten ), lucid emptiness (gsa! stong), indeterminate (lung ma bstan), the house of the light of pure awareness (rig pa 'od kyi khang pa), the abiding base (gnas pa'i gzhi), and so forth. The mantra tradition also explains many synonyms, such as causal continuum (rgyu'i rgyud), base continuum (gzhi'i rg_yrul),"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion ... 93 quintessence continuum (bcud kyi rgyud), supporting continuum (rten pa'i rgyud), all-continuum (kun gyi rgyud), beginningless continuum (thog ma med pa'i rgyud), core continuum (snying po'i rgyud), and so on. To be learned in the secrets of the all-base and mind and conscious-ness without confusion about the meaning of the names that are thus explained endlessly in the siitras and tantras as synonyms for all-base is to be unconfused about all Buddhist teachings and to fully master them. This is taught in the Sections on Grounds Sutra.92 1. Afflictive Mentation The mentation with afflictive states93 is that which fixates on the self with no reference to the all-base consciousness that is lucid, empty pure awareness, the nature of light. 3· Mental Consciousness The mental consciousness (yid kyi rnam par shes pa) is so-called because it fixates on outer and inner phenomena, or objects. As it says in the Journey to Lanka: Mind is the all-base consciousness. The thought of\"I\" is the afflicted mentation. Whatever it is that fixates on objective reality, is called \"mental consciousness.\"94 4· Consciousnesses of the Five Senses The consciousnesses of the five senses (sgo lnga'i rnam par shes pa) are the eye consciousness that apprehends form, ear [consciousness] that apprehends sound, nose [consciousness] that apprehends smells, tongue [consciousness] that apprehends tastes, and the body [con-sciousness] that apprehends tactile sensations. Since it is aware and conscious of those objects in that way, it is it is held to be conscious-ness. Furthermore, mind [as] all-base is indeterminate. Mentation with afflictive states is unvirtuous. Mental consciousness is both virtuous"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"94 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion and unvirtuous. The journey to Lanka states: Mind is wholly indeterminate. Mental [consciousness] becomes both [because when) consciousness95 arises, it is virtuous and unvirtuous.96 There are ten virtues of the mental [consciousness). The non virtues of mental [consciousness) are six primary afflictive states and twenty sec-ondary afflictive states.97 Therefore, this mental (consciousness] can be both virtuous and unvirtuous. The consciousnesses of the five doors of the sense organs are indeterminate. It is also taught this way in the Sub-lime Absorption Sutra: Mind is indeterminate. The affiicted one is unvirtuous. Mental [consciousness] is both virtue and vice. The five sense doors are indeterminate.98 B. The Four Empowerments The basis of secret mantra is the four empowerments, as stated in the Actualization ofTimeless Awareness: The tantric basis is the four empowerments because they are the basic support for creation and completion.99 And from Secret l)akini: Tantra is the essence of the four empowerments; [both] the subject and the medium are tantra.100 All of that was the exposition on how the base abides."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of illusion .. 95 III. The Path Next, to explain the nature of the methods or the path of unity101 with its corresponding signs. There is both a brief presentation and an exten-sive explanation. A. BriefPresentation The factors of enlightenment are presented as inseparable from illu-sion and dream. From the [Sittra of the Perfection oJWisdom in} Eigh-teen Thousand [Lines}: Children of gods, the applications of mindfulness are like dreams, like illusions. In the same way, the genuine renun-ciations and the supports of miraculous powers, the facul-ties, the powers, the branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path are all like dreams, like illusions. Chil-dren of gods, the ten powers of a tathagata are similarly like dreams, like illusions. Likewise, the four fearlessnesses, the four modes of specific genuine awareness, great love, great compassion, and the eighteen distinct qualities of a buddha are like dreams, like illusions.102 The Array of Sacred Oaths Subsequent Tantra says: Lord of Secrets, [Vajrapani], realize that the five sense support objects and all other categories-the palace residence and the resident forms of deities-are like illusions. Know that in the same way those residences and residents are also inseparable from the factors of enlightenment. Thus those residences and residents are also the nonduality of illusion and the factors of enlightenment. They are not divisible into two.103"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"96 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion [8] From those, the path becomes sublime. The paths and grounds are traversed through months and years of guru devotion. As said in the Actualization ofTimeless Awareness: Stages of the grounds and paths are traversed through months and years of guru devotion. If one is never apart from the guru's manifestation, then one will dwell together with all buddhas. 104 The Array of Sacred Oaths says: By six months of unwavering devotion the ground ofVajradhara is attained.105 [ 10] The same thing is expressed in the fifty sections of tantra.106 Fur-thermore, all appearance exists as the five families. By taking that as the path and meditating on it, appearances need not be dispelled by other [methods].That is to adhere to the sacred oath of secret mantra. It says in the Array ofSacred Oaths of the Five Families: Nirvirana Vishkambin, whoever wishes to abide by the sacred oaths of the five families should understand the shapes of all phenomena as the five insignia. Know the vari-ous colors as the five families. Similarly, the five elements, the five aggregates, the five afflictive states, and the variety of sentient beings should be known as the five families. Thus the various shapes, colors, elements, aggregates, afflictions, and beings are the five families without any duality; they are not divisible into two.107 The form of the deity, whether created in ritual or self-arising, is cre-ation phase in its appearing aspect and completion phase in its empty aspect; by nature an inseparable unity. From Actualization: The deity's form that purifies the ordinary is creation phase from the aspect of its appearance"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. 97 and completion phase from the aspect of its emptiness. This is taught in this way as inseparable. And from the same source: All things are appearance and emptiness inseparable. Creation and completion and their unity; there is not a single phenomenon that is not creation and completion. This is the way that enlightenment is taught. [n) The clarity of the deity's appearance is taken on the path as nirmaQakaya, the bliss as sarpbhogakaya, and the nonconceptuality as dharmakaya. From the Array ofSacred Oaths: The clarity of phenomena is nirm3.Qakaya. The nonconcep-tuality of that is dharmakaya. Because that freedom from concept is joyful, it is the sarpbhogakaya. This is the way enlightenment has been taught. In this way, the nonconceptual wisdom of the clarity of all phenomena is the timeless awareness of the path that is like the first day of the new moon. The timeless awareness of the fruition is like the full moon. It says in the Vimalakirti Sutra: Whoever dwells in sublime meditative absorption [experiences] clarity without concept and comprehends vividness while not having conceptual thought. The timeless awareness of the path and fruition grows like the new moon becoming full.108 In this way, taking appearances and deities and the factors of enlight-enment as inseparable from illusion on the path should be understood through mastering the victor's siitras and tantras."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"98 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion B. Extensive Explanation: The Five Paths Experience and the five paths and ten grounds are inseparable from illusion. [13) The essence of the path is that it is the way of combining calm abid-ing and higher insight. The literal explanation is that since one desires to arrive at supreme enlightenment it is called \"path.\" The divisions are the Path of Accumulation, the Path of Application, the Path of Seeing, the Path ofMeditation, and the Path of Consummation. 1. The Path of Accumulation [14) The essence of the Path of Accumulation is to abandon vice and to earnestly undertake the practice of virtue. It is defined as the gather-ing of the accumulations for the purpose of realizing the nature of phe-nomena (chos nyid; dharmatti). [ 1 s) There are three divisions: the lesser, intermediate, and greater paths of accumulation. a. The Lesser Path of Accumulation [r6] Since carelessness and impaired mindfulness are the cause of downfalls, the meditative absorption on the lesser Path of Accumula-tion involves four direct applications of mindfulness.109 In the Sutra of Bodhisattva Drdhramati, uo Drdhramati asks, \"Bhagavan, how should one meditate on the four direct applications of mindfulness?\" The Bhagavan answers: [17] Drdhramati, you ask how a bodhisattva practices the direct application of mindfulness of the body in scrutinizing the body. You should examine individually the body's past limits, future limits, and present occurrence. Alas! Examin-ing this body [that arises from] causes and conditions [one finds it] to be impermanent and changing, like an illusion. In this body there is nothing to call \"mine.\" You must impart heart to this body that has no heart. What is that heart? It is"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion -4 99 to accomplish and attain the Body of the Tathagata. That is the direct application of mindfulness of the body. [x8] Drdhramati, you ask how one should practice the direct application of mindfulness of sensation to sensations. Any sensation is pertinent: pleasant sensations cause joy, painful sensations cause hatred, and those that are neither cause dullness. Train [in considering that) all of your sensa-tions are like an illusion and without intrinsic nature. Teach the dharma so that all sentient beings can cut the continuity of sensation. For what reason? Realized sensation is bliss-ful. Unrealized sensation becomes painful. Therefore, the wisdom that all the sensations in all mental images, mental engagements, and all designations of possible phenomena are like an illusion is the direct application of the mindful-ness of sensation. [19) Drdhramati, you ask how one should practice the direct application of mindfulness of scrutinizing the mind with the mind. Mind, once it arises, is perishing-it does not abide. It is not that once you have initially engendered mind it then abides. No matter what, it does not abide. Therefore mind does not see mind. Thus, the defining characteristic of the mind is that it is like an illusion. Since therefore there is no [real) defining characteristic, you should rest without fix-ation. That is the direct application of mindfulness to mind. [ 20] Drdhramati, you ask how one should practice the direct application of mindfulness of phenomena by scruti-nizing phenomena. Other than anything being emptiness, without attributes, and without aspirations,m do not imag-ine that there is even a speck of existing phenomena. While looking at that phenomenon and abiding, by genuinely see-ing the nature of phenomena, you are genuinely not actually seeing the nonphenomena. As for what is called \"the direct application of mindfulness [to phenomena),\" the Buddha said that all labels of the multiplicity of phenomena are mere names. You will not find anything inside or outside [corresponding to) names or phenomena. So freedom from"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"100 .. Niguma, Lady of illusion extremes and truly existent phenomena is the direct applica-tion of mindfulness to phenomena. b. The Intermediate Path of Accumulation [ 21] Furthermore, on the intermediate level of the Path of Accumu-lation, one comes to regard vice and nonvirtue as toxic since they are the cause of suffering. In order to renounce them, there are medita-tions on the four aspects of genuine renunciation.112 Drdhramati asked, \"How should one regard the four aspects of genuine renunciation?\" The Bhagavan answered: [22.-2s] Drdhramati, you ask about the fourfold path of a bodhisattva. In order not to generate vice and unvirtuous factors that have not yet arisen, one develops determination, makes effort, initiates diligence, takes control of the mind, and fully engages in what is genuine. In order to totally renounce those vices and unvirtuous factors that have arisen, one develops determination and the rest, as before. In order to generate virtuous factors that have not yet arisen, one develops determination and the rest, as before. In order that the virtuous factors that have arisen may remain, continu-ally increase, not diminish, and not be wasted, one develops determination and the rest, as before. [ 26-2 7] Drdhramati, \"vices and unvirtuous factors\" are those things that are incongruous with ethical discipline, meditative absorption, and wisdom. The things that are incongruous with ethical discipline are impaired ethical discipline and all those factors that will cause it to become impaired. Those things that are incongruous with medita-tive absorption are whatever distracts the mind and impairs meditative absorption. Those things that are incongruous with wisdom are impaired views or holding one's own views as supreme, factors that will obscure the genuine [view!. The mental engagement is to develop determination, make"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of illusion .. 101 effort, initiate diligence, take control of the mind, and fully engage in what is genuine in order to renounce unvirtuous factors. That is the first genuine renunciation. [2.8] Furthermore, those so-called unvirtuous factors are called \"desirous attachment;' \"angry aggression;' and \"unaware dullness;' arising from any cause. The mental en-gagement is to pacify desire with [the meditation on] foul-ness, aggression with love, and stupidity with [meditation on] interdependence. By the distinct revelation of any af-flictive emotion, it is \"renounced.\" Whatever is renounced will no [longer] be found, and that is the second genuine renunciation. [ 2.9) \"To develop determination, make effort, initiate dili-gence, take control of the mind, and fully engage in what is genuine in order to generate whatever virtuous factors have not yet arisen\" [means] determination in the immeasurable virtuous factors that are to be accomplished and putting that into practice through complete control of the mind. This is the root of all the roots of virtue, and it is the third genuine renunciation. [30) In order that the virtuous factors that have arisen may remain, continually increase, not diminish, and not be wasted, one must dedicate all the roots of virtue to enlight-enment. For what reason? By dedicating absolutely all the roots of virtue to omniscience without [applying them] to remaining in the three realms, then nothing whatsoever will be wasted. This is the fourth genuine renunciation. c. The Greater Path of Accumulation [31) Then, on the greater Path of Accumulation, which is the nature of meditative absorption, there are meditations on the four supports of miraculous ability.113 Drdhramati inquired, \"Bhagavan, how should one regard the four supports of miraculous ability?\" The Bhagavan answered:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"102 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion Drdhramati, there are four in the path of the bodhisattva. What are those four? The meditative absorption of deter-mination that is the support of miraculous ability which has the volition of renunciation, the meditative absorption of diligence that is the support of miraculous ability which has the volition of renunciation, the meditative absorption of intention that is the support of miraculous ability which has the volition of renunciation, and the meditative absorption of conduct114 that is the support of miraculous ability which has the volition of renunciation. (32] Drdhramati, whoever (knows] all phenomena to be nonexistent and like illusion, without any frame of reference, free of fixation, [that person] is without fear or anticipation of fear (concerning phenomena], and is joyous and enthusi-astic, which generates determination. That is the meditative absorption of determination. (33] Drdhramati, whoever possesses the determination of one-pointed faith abandons the endeavors of all worldly concerns and resists everything that causes sloth, all the while maintaining constant diligence. That is the meditative absorption of diligence. (34] Drdhramati, whoever, through possessing the unin-terrupted effort of effort, has one-pointed intention con-cerning mind's intrinsic nature oflucid clarity, which has no established existence whatsoever or frame of reference115-that is the meditative absorption of intention. (35] Drdhramati, whoever possesses one-pointed medita-tive absorption engages in all the four periods of moving, walking, sitting, and lying down without ever leaving that meditative absorption-that is the meditative absorption of (engaged] conduct. (37-38] Furthermore, Drdhramati, why are these called \"supports of miraculous activity\"? It is because those medi-tative absorptions cause one to renounce all mistaken fac-tors, engage genuine virtue, arrive at a genuine place, and"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion • 103 progress. [In that sense] the nature of the meditative absorp-tion is called \"the support of miraculous activity.\" [39][Aspects of] the lesser Path of Accumulation that are partially concordant with liberation are that the special outlook of faith in the Jewels and the special faith from the distinct revelation116 of all phe-nomena arise in one's stream of being. The conducive aspects of the intermediate [level] are the birth of diligence and enthusiasm with ref-erence to the six perfections. The aspect conducive to liberation on the greater [Path of Accumulation] is the birth offrequent, short noncon-ceptual meditative absorptions in one's stream of being. [40-43] In this way, the signs of the four [aspects on the] three [levels]-[or] twelve [in all]-on the Path of Accumulation is that once the pure ethical discipline refrains the doors of the senses from any impropriety, one shuns even the slightest evil misdeed. Therefore one understands that all external hateful enemies come from oneself and that there is no self and no other. That which is renounced are the ten nonvirtues accumulated through the three poisons. [ 44] The parameters of the Path of Accumulation are from the first thought of the preliminary determination until the arising of the time-less awareness of warmth. 2. The Path of Application [45] The essence of the Path of Application is the unity of calm abiding and higher insight. The literal explanation is that since it applies to the Path of Seeing, it is called the \"Path of Application\" (sbyor lam). The divisions are four: warmth, peak, acceptance, and supreme dharma.117 a. Warmth and Peak The defining characteristic is [meditative] warmth since there is an early sign (snga ltas) of the fire of non conceptual timeless awareness from the Path of Seeing. Alternatively, it is warmth since one realizes that all the afHictive states that have arisen are baseless or without intrinsic nature."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion It is the timeless awareness of the peak [experience] since the roots of virtue increase, or since one has a slight realization without fixation of the clarity-emptiness of the factors of total perfection. The meditation that mentally engages this are meditations on the five faculties118 at the time of warmth and peak. Concerning that, Drdhramati asked, \"Bhagavan, what are the five faculties.\" The Bhaga-van answered: Drdhramati, on the path of the bodhisattva there are five. What are those five? The faculty of faith, the faculty of dili-gence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of meditative absorption, and the faculty of wisdom. [ 46] What is the faculty offaith? This concerns the actual faith in the genuine view for a worldly person involved in cyclic existence. When such a person would not commit vice even to save their life for fear of the fully ripening con-sequences of action, and enters into the conduct of a bodhi-sattva, and harbors no doubts when hearing about emptiness, absence of characteristics, the powers, fearlessness, and other qualities of a buddha, [but experiences only] joy, then that faith is the faculty of faith. [ 4 7] What is diligence? To generate the power of dili-gence in whatever dharma one has faith in is the faculty of diligence. [48] What is the faculty of mindfulness? To [apply] the power of mindfulness to whatever dharmas were dili-gently gathered so that they are not lost is the faculty of mindfulness. [49] What is the faculty of meditative absorption? To apply the power of undistracted, one-pointed meditative absorption to whatever dharma has been retained through the faculty of mindfulness of those dharmas is the faculty of meditative absorption. [so] What is the faculty of wisdom? To examine those dharmas that have been retained through the faculty of mindfulness of whatever dharmas, and to thus know that"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion • ros all dharmas are like illusions and totally nonexistent is the faculty of wisdom. [ 6 4] In general there are twenty signs of abiding in the four [levels of] the Path of Application. First, the ten signs of warmth, according to Maitreyanatha: (I) Countering form and so on, 119 ( 2.) the expiration of doubts, 120 ( 3) nonleisure, ( 4) dwelling in virtue oneself, ( s) establishing others in it also, ( 6) [practicing] generosity and so on as support for others, ( 7) no hesitation about the profound meaning, ( 8) loving [actions] of the body, and so on, not accompanied by the five obscurations, 121 (9) all latent tendencies conquered, (I o) mindfulness, and awareness.122 From the Actualization of Timeless Awareness: lllusion-like direct experience is in small part the warmth of timeless awareness. Sometimes the teaching of timeless awareness of conduct increases the direct experience. [66] Four signs of the peak [experience] are taught by Maitreya:123 Clean clothing and such, parasites and such not occurring on the body, mind free of deception, assuming abstinence, and eliminating avarice.124 Even in dreams all phenomena are seen to be like dreams, and so forth; signs ofarrival at the peak of application. They were held to be twelve.125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"106 ,. Niguma, Lady of ILlusion From the Latter Ocean Tantra: When once a dream is recognized the yogin is blissful for a fortnight. Gods, nagas, and gandharvas make offerings and praise. Heroes and <;lakinis actually gather 'round. It is the ship ofliberation from the sea of bad existence.126 b. Acceptance and Supreme Dharma [ 67] Then there are meditations on the five powers on the [levels of] acceptance and supreme dharma. Drdhramati asked, \"Bhagavan, what are the five powers?\" And the Bhagavan answered: Drdhramati, there are five on the path of the bodhisattva. What are those five? They are the power of faith, the power of diligence, the power of mindfulness, the power of medita-tive absorption, and the power of wisdom. [68] What is the power offaith? It is to be unintimidated by anyone at all with regard to that in which one has faith and one-pointed interest. [For instance]. if a devil came and transformed into a buddha right in front of you and said, \"Yours is not the [true] dharma;' and [tried to] convert or avert you, you would not lose [that faith] or [try to] escape. Moreover, [even] the four great elements that can change things could not divest you of that power that is focused in the power offaith. That is the power offaith. [ 69] What is the power of diligence? Whoever has under-taken diligent [application) and through the force of the power of steadfast adherence to whatever virtuous dharma it is, maintains such power of diligence until that goal is achieved, so that no one at all would be able to turn one away from it-that is the power of diligence. [7o] What is the power of mindfulness? It is an undis-tracted mind in the direct application of mindfulness to any"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. 107 and all phenomena. That is, the power of mindfulness that no afflictive emotion can overwhelm. If that mindfulness is not defeated by afflictive emotion, then it is the power of mindfulness. [71] What is the power of meditative absorption? With conscientious mindfulness that is not overwhelmed by afflic-tive emotion, wherever one dwells is isolated from busyness. One does not get involved in the notion of fixating on all those objects of attachment and aggression, such as form and so on. Being totally nonconceptual about any phenom-enon is the attainment of the power of isolation from busy-ness. That is the power of meditative absorption. [72] What is the power of wisdom? Fully knowing all mundane and supramundane phenomena through the power of wisdom, that which liberates worldly beings from cyclic existence arises from the power of wisdom and time-less awareness. Therefore it is called \"the power of wisdom.\" [ 73-7 4] Why are they called five powers? As the five faculties stabilize, their power increases, so they are called \"powers\" (stobs). [75-76] The signs of acceptance, according to Maitreya: Proceeding by possessing the nature of phenomena, seeking hell for the sake of sentient beings, impervious to others' misguidance, and as to devils expounding alien paths, realizing that they are \"devils.\"127 [77-79] From the Questions ofFour Girls: Having stayed alone in the forest and taken up the practice of phenomena as illusion, the various dreams are known as dreams and one abides in acceptance, free of bad existence.l2ll"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"108 ,. Niguma, Lady of Illusion [So] [From Ornament of Clear Realization:] The single sign of supreme dharma is conduct that pleases Buddha. Through those twenty signs abiding in warmth and peak with acceptance, and supreme dharma, one will not turn back from perfect enlightenment.129 From the [Sutra of] Kumaraprabha\"': Free of all worldly attachment, whoeyer possesses the altruistic mind pleases the victorious ones like no other dharma.130 [ 82]The eliminations are the same as before: [the ten unvirtuous actions accumulated through the three poisons.] The parameters are from the timeless awareness of warmth up until supreme dharma. 3· The Path of Seeing [ 8 3] Now I will explain the Path of Seeing. The essence of the Path of Seeing is that the meaning of the four noble truths lacks a frame of ref-erence. The literal explanation is that the Path of Seeing is the direct seeing of the nature of phenomena that was not seen before. There are four divisions: suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path. The defining characteristics of the divisions are to see suffering and the other truths as emptiness, which is the acceptance of the know-ing of phenomena.131 Additionally, the subsequent moment of knowing sees that emptiness in an expansive way. It is that seeing of the nature of phenomena that is the Path of Seeing. The realization of thinking that both the acceptance and knowing of phenomena are the infll-lible causes of attaining enlightenment is the acceptance of subsnJUCnt knowing of the four truths. The arising of decisive certainty that such"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion • 109 realization is unmistaken is the acceptance of the subsequent knowing of the phenomena of the four truths.1321hat is seeing with the timeless awareness of the Path of Seeing. Those are differentiated by four degrees of [seeing] the extent of the nature of phenomena: lesser, greater, still greater, and much greater. [ 84] The mental engagement of the meditative absorption [involves] the seven branches of enlightenment.133 In the Questions of Matisamb-hava Sutra*, 134 Matisambhava* asks, \"Bhagavan, how should one regard the seven branches of enlightenment?\" The Bhagavan responds: [8s] Matisambhava, since one neither recollects nor deliber-ates anything, all phenomena are empty of their own char-acteristics. To see all phenomena as in essence nonexistent is the genuine mindfulness branch of enlightenment. [86] Matisambhava, since one [sees that] there is no established existence to virtue, nonvirtue, or neutrality, all designations of phenomena have no frame of reference and are illusion-like. This is the revealing phenomena branch of enlightenment. [87] Matisambhava, since one totally eradicates concepts about phenomena, there is actual realization of the path without accepting or discarding the phenomena of nirvana or the three realms, freedom from fixation, enthusiasm, non-discursive interest, and sustained effort. This is the genuine diligence branch of enlightenment. [88] Matisambhava, since one totally eradicates all joy and sorrow, joy about habitual phenomena is not aroused, and intense affiictive states are removed. This is the genuine joy branch of enlightenment. [ 89] Matisambhava, since one has not even an atom of reference point to any phenomenon that one references, the extreme physical and mental agility [with regard to] all phe-nomena causes the mind to abide in meditative absorption without obscuration or reference point. This is the genuine extreme agility branch of enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"uo .. Niguma, Lady oflllusion (90] Matisambhava, since one totally eradicates or real-izes the fixation on all phenomena, the mind does not refer-ence anything at all. When the mind rests in equipoise on anything, the realization of phenomena occurs. But if the mind does [not] rest in equipoise, it is not it.135 And if the mind rests in equipoise that is not the equipoise of awaken-ing, it is not it. In this way, the placement in equipoise free of fixation is the genuine meditative absorption branch of enlightenment. (91] Matisarnbhava, one does not abide in phenomena whatsoever, nor depend [on them], nor attach [to them], nor bond [with them]. Mind does not fixate on phenom-ena at all-happy, sad, or in between. Without being carried away by all the mundane phenomena, once one is possessed of the equanimity that is genuinely not preoccupied with all phenomena, it is a joy. This is the genuine equanimity branch of enlightenment. Matisambhava, this is how you should regard the seven branches of enlightenment. [ 100] Thus by the power of that absorption, one directly sees the nature of phenomena, and when endowed with the clairvoyant powers, knows heartrending joy. Ever pure in conduct, one can transform this body for beings and give up one's life for dharma. The intelligent [experience] this on the Path of Seeing; it is explained as the sign of a nonreturner. [Ioi-5] In addition to that, twelve hundred qualities will also develop. [106] It says in the Flower Ornament Sutra: As soon as one attains that ground one is free of five fears: lack of sustenance, death, criticism, lower realms, and [trouble-some] retinue.136 Free of those fears, one finds nothing causing anxiety. This is because the self does not dwell there.137 One should understand the freedom from these five fears."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Stages in the Path of Illusion .. 111 There are one hundred and twelve eliminations on the first Path ofSee-ing.138 In particular, the six imputed [or acquired] afflictive states.13' These are ignorance, desire, pride, anger, doubt, and [mistaken] views.140 There are five views [to be eliminated]: the view of the transitory col-lection [as a self], fixation on extremes, perverse views, holding views as paramount, and holding one's ethical discipline and deliberate conduct [as paramount] .141 Adding those five views to the five non views of igno-rance and so on makes the ten affiictive states. 142 In the desire realm, those ten afflictive states of views [and non views] occur [in relation to] each of the four truths, so that there are forty. In the higher realms-the form and formless realms-[because they are] without anger, there are nine [afflictive states] connected with each of the four truths. This makes nine times four, or thirty-six, for the form realm and nine times four, or thirty-six, for the formless realm; seventy-two in all.143 Adding the forty of the desire realm to that, we get the one hundred and twelve factors that are eliminated on the Path of Seeing. This is how they are eliminated: The greatest of the great affiictive states to be eliminated on the Path of Seeing are like a great darkness, and the least timeless awareness dispels them like a candle. Again, as above, they are eliminated by the four truths and by the realization of no-self. which eliminates them all at once.

Matisambhava asked, \"Bhagavan, how should one regard the eightfold noble path of a bodhisattva?\" And the Bhaga-van answered: [113] Matisambhava, the equality of all phenomena is the genuine view. So the view [that there exists] the self or the person or the sentient being or the life-force or emptiness does not produce the genuine view. To be free of all views, from the least reference point of a view up through nirv;Ula, whether superior, average, or inferior-that is the genuine view. [ II4] Matisambhava, whatever thought [one has, one should] eliminate thoughts. One who is skilled in the higher insight that incorporates calm abiding eliminates thoughts of good and bad phenomena, thorough thinking, and all discursive thought. Not thinking of anything, no thoughts at all, no thoughts even about what is genuine-that is gen-uine thought. [us] Matisambhava, whatever words [one utters should] not hurt oneself or others. They should not cause afflictive states in oneself, nor cause afflictive states in others. Words that induce the certain realization149 of the equality of all phenomena-that is genuine speech.

[117] Matisambhava, not to accumulate afflictive states is genuine livelihood. That is any livelihood that does not hurt oneself or hurt others and that achieves the purpose of the dharma-that is genuine livelihood. [118] Matisambhava, effort is for accomplishing the dharma that is profound, free of elaboration, and uncom-pounded. Real, genuine persistence that includes mental attention, determination, diligence, and being undaunted in that purpose is genuine effort. [ 119] Matisambhava, any mindfulness should afford no opportunity to all the afflictive states. That includes the mindfulness of the branches of enlightenment [such as the direct application of mindfulness to] the mind, mindfulness of the immeasurables, and mindfulness of the six perfections. Any mindfulness that affords no opportunity to the devil, any mindfulness that does not turn into the wrong path, mindfulness that is like a sentinel that allows no opportu-nity for all of the unvirtuous phenomena of the mind and mental events-that is genuine mindfulness.

From the second through the tenth grounds twelve hundred unimaginable qualities arise. The [factors] that are eliminated on the Path of Meditation are divided into six latent affiictive states that one is born with.150 What are those six? They are ignorance, desire, anger, pride, the view of the transitory collection [as a self], and the view of fixating on extremes.1s1 For the desire realm, if we divide each of those six into great, medium, [and small, and each of those in turn into great, medium, and small, such as greater great, greater medium, and so on], then there are nine [divisions] in each. The timeless awareness that eliminates them is also divided into nine [aspects] of great, medium, [and small]. So nine [divisions] of six makes fifty-four.1s2 In the form realm anger has been discarded, so for the [remaining] ones, the five affiictive states of the first meditative stability each have nine divisions that are eliminated by nine timeless awarenesses (great, medium, and so on). Nine times five is forty-five. In the second, third, and fourth [meditative stabilities], there are forty-five each, making one hundred and eighty.

Like torchlight illuminating gold coins in a dungeon, the most subtle of subtle obscurations are conquered by the ability of natural purity and natural freedom.

The Highest Timeless Awareness Tantra says: [128] The uncompounded basic space itself and timeless awareness are not two. The complete purity of emotional and cognitive [ obscurations] is the dharmakaya endowed with two purities. [ 129] Without change, birth, or characteristics, all buddhas are dharmakaya.

[The appearance of light is based on the lightning]. In the same way, the merit-kaya159 appears based on the dharmakaya, and the nirmaQakaya appears based on the merit-kaya.160 There is this enumeration of three kayas that in essence are not three.

The Fruition: Buddhahood There are two manners of becoming a buddha: in the traditions of the perfections and of mantra. Then in the perfections there are two: the small vehicle and the great vehicle. According to the small vehicle, Prince Siddhartha182 attained bud-dhahood as an ordinary [person, after traversing] the ten grounds, at Akaninha, the Unexcelled Realm, or the Vajra Seat [in Bodhgaya]. According to the great vehicle, this victorious one had reached bud-dhahood countless eons earlier. It says in the White Lotus Sutra: Children of good families, I became a buddha previously many billions of eons ago. 183 And in the Meeting ofFather and Son: In ancient times, immeasurable countless eons ago, I became a buddha called \"Buddha Indraketu.\"184 [197 ]According to the yoga tradition of secret mantra, Prince Siddhartha went to Akanigha, and like a sesame bag bursting open, all the buddhas said, \"Son of a good family, how will you attain buddha-hood?\"Thinking thus, he subsequently became buddha based on the outer five manifest awakenings. [198] According to the father tantras of highest yoga tantra, in Akani~~a he received empowerment from Mahavairochana. He be-came a buddha there, and an emanation of that was the buddha here.

He attained the state of a thirteenth-ground vajra-holder by relying on an excellent woman. As stated in the Tantra of Total Nona biding: All the buddhas of the eleventh ground attain the state of vajra-holder by relying on the mudra of a woman.188 Alternatively, that tenth-ground bodhisattva in Akanigha received the complete four empowerments from the great Vajradhara in union as saq1bhogakaya and great Vajradhara as sukhakaya, the sixth family. By that, he traversed to the fourteenth ground. It says in the Tantra of Vajra Bliss and in the Tantra of Timeless Awareness Drops: The vase empowerment is the eleventh, the secret empowerment the excellent twelfth, the wisdom-timeless awareness the thirteenth, thus the tathagata is the fourteenth.

Niguma, Lady of Illusion As to this, some [believe that] Akanigha of the Pure Domains is per-ishable. The Akani~¥ta of Dense Array is not perishable. As it states in VajraPeak: The joyous realm of Dense Akani~¥ta, the pure land Dense Array, is not perishable. There, the dharma of the buddhas arises in the manner of perfect sarpbhogakaya. ~ They hold that, \"The place where the sarpbhogakaya of great Vairo-chana Immense Ocean dwells, surrounded by a retinue of tenth-ground bodhisattvas, is Dense Array. That does not perish. All of the lesser pure lands that exist within that are nirm3.f:lakaya pure lands, and therefore will perish.\" If that is so, and the realm of Immense Ocean does not perish, then [Pure Domains] also does not perish. The reason is that [otherwise] there would be both an explanation as a pure land and an explanation as a worldly realm. For instance, if an individual's limbs, eyes, ears, and so on are individually all impermanent, then their whole body would also be impermanent. The reason is that the general and the particular are subject to [the same] limits. Therefore, the place of Pure Domains is Akani~~ha. Akani~~ha ~ a place that has \"abandoned\" Pure Domains is like a hermitage is to a town. That it is imperishable is because it only appears to tenth-ground bodhisattvas.

Therefore, all scripture is scripture in accord with that.191 From the Tantra of All-Victorious Nonduality: The place of supreme timdess awareness, the fine place of excellent Pure Domains: here the Bhagavan dwells forever in Akani~¥ta.

They were given to Khyungpo Naljor a total of four times during his encounter with the 4akini, and by her own tes-tament were held only by herself and her teacher Rahula in all of India. Their practice is \"the roots\" of the tree of the Five Golden Dharmas of the Glorious Shangpa Kagyu, and indeed they serve that function. The teachings of the six dharmas, whether ofNiguma or Naropa, ulti-mately derive from the completion phase practices (rdzogs rim) in the major yoga tantras. These are the practices that make use of the subtle energetic currents and essences in the body (\"the subtle body\" or \"vajra body\"), using yogic exercises, breathing techniques, and visualizations to control those energies and thereby the state of the mind. These yogic practices represent the \"path of means\" (thabs lam) or techniques in training with the body as the means to change the mind. It is a central tenet of tantric teachings that the human body in this way embodies the potential for enlightenment. Sangye Tonpa's Collection of Necessary Oral Advice on Nigumas Six Dharmas attempts to differentiate the tantric sources of the two sys-tems: The six dharmas, according to Naropa's position, are the collected essence of all mother tantras, and of those are considered to be from the esoteric instructions of Hevajra."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"136 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion According to the Niguma position, they are the essence of all the father tantras condensed in one direction. In par-ticular, they are based on the jewel Ocean Tantra. Accord-ing to Rinpoche, there are many teachings on dream and lucid clarity from the fifteenth chapter (or fifteen chap-ters) of Guhyasamdja, so the primary source is said to be Guhyasamdja.1 Concerning Niguma's six dharmas, Jamgon Kongtrul connects the Hevajra tantra specifically with inner heat and Guhyasamdja with illu-sory body and lucid clarity, while the tantra of Mahdmdyd is connected with the dream yoga practice.2 In any case, as we have seen, it is diffi-cult to definitely cite the source and ultimately perhaps irrelevant since these teachings are cherished as the direct revelations of the Buddha Vajradhara. In his Treasury of Knowledge, Kongtrul elucidates three exceptional qualities of the Shangpa lineage, among which is this: The oral instructions are exceptional because the Vajra Lines that were listed by the ljakini of timeless awareness are unerr-ing in meaning and uncorrupted in letter. They have not been afflicted with the compositions and alterations derived from the intellectual analyses of ordinary people.3 This is a very interesting statement since, at first glance, most editions of the Vajra Lines-and above all the one in Kongtrul's own collection-appear to be a jumble of indecipherable notes upon notes with tiny flea-tracks connecting fragments of comments to their places between words. In fact, none of the six texts that I consulted contain the actual unadorned vajra lines. Tangtong Gyalpo, who received the \"direct transmission\" from Niguma in vision, quotes each verse and then com-ments upon it, so that presumably one may use the text in his Collec-tion of the Essentials to determine which parts are the \"real\" vajra lines. The clearest presentation I have seen is in an illuminated manuscript, written in gold, in the collected works of Lochen Gyurme Dcchm.' There, the scribe's wise use of fonts clarifies the intent: the main vajra lines are written in large Tibetan print called \"uchen\" (dbu chm ). the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"1he Six Dharmas ofNiguma .. 137 clarifying prose sentences after each verse are in large letters of a differ-ent script called \"ume\" (dbu med), and the comments which adorn the interspaces are in small print (yig chung). But who was responsible for each of these layers? This is not easy to sort out with certainty. The \"actual\" (dngos) vajra lines are those in all editions and commentaries that one can assume are Niguma's verses as remembered by Khyungpo Naljor. The next level may also be attrib-uted to the same source; perhaps they were not integral to the origi-nal verses, but were added as prose clarification by Khyungpo Naljor based on Niguma's teachings. According to the colophon here, they were translated by Lendarma Lodro and \"verified\" or finalized by the great translator Rinchen Zangpo at Tholing monastery. This event is also alluded to in the life story of Khyungpo Naljor. Returning from India, Khyungpo befriended the translators Lendarma Lodro and Gayadhara, and came to Tholing monastery in Ngari {mNga ris), part of the ancient Guge kingdom of western Tibet. There he encountered the great master Atisha Dipaqtkarasrijfiana (982.-1054), who we know was in residence there for three years beginning in 1042..s Khyungpo Naljor felt that his texts had been corrupted and that he should return to India, but Atisha announced that \"they are in accord with my Indian texts; it would be good to give them to Rinchen Zangpo to translate.\"' So it came to be, it seems, that the Vajra Lines of the Six Dharmas were translated by both Lendarma Lodro and Rinchen Zangpo, the famous translator from Tholing. Taranatha specifies that what was first trans-lated by Lendarma was retranslated by Rinchen Zangpo and then cor-rected by Atisha himsel£7 The only other Niguma text that bears the latter's name is Glorious Immortal Great Timeless Awareness! Finally, the interlinear small print that is not included in the canon but only in later texts appears to be ultimately by Gyurme Dechen. That is how I make sense of the following additional information found in Gyurme Dechen's edition, as well as those in Kongtrul's Treasury of Instructions and in the Shangpa Texts: In the Vajra Lines, Khyungpo's notes are an integral part.

Niguma, Lady of Illusion Dechen examined them carefully with his great intellect, and arranged the more expanded [version]. May this be of vast benefit to the doctrine and to sentient beings.9 This addition is further commented upon by Jamgon Kongtrul and appears only in his edition and in the Shangpa Texts which were cop-ied directly from it: Here, all the verses are the vajra lines themselves, while the prose in between seems to be the oral directions of the c;lakini that have been written and arranged. This is the extensive commentary by Lochen Gyurme Dechen. Still confused? In another text, Kongtrul recapitulates: This text ends, \"Lotsawa Lendarma Lodro translated it; later, Lochen Rinchen Zangpo verified it.\" One with Khyungpo's notes included and one where Buddhasri separated the source from the notes, adding some notes, and again care-fully examined by Lochen Gyurme Dechen are two differ-ent [versions]. \"Clarifying Words of the Six Dharmas\" with the notes is by Khyungpo.10 In keeping with the plan, I have translated here the text as it appears in the canon-that is, the Vajra Lines of verse and the interspersed prose. Since these were not distinguished there by the clever use of fonts, I have followed the edition in Gyurme Dechen's collected works by using ital-ics where he has used the ume script. I have not included the notes, but have relied on them for clarification, mainly those in Gyurme Dechen's text, since they do appear to originate with him, and in any case that is the least problematic version. These are just translation issues. In fact, these Vajra Lines were never intended to be understood except by those who genuinely put them into practice with the help of a qualified teacher.

In this tradition and in others, such as the Marpa Kagyu, Kadampa, and Chod lineages, the word \"mahamudra\" connotes the highest realization and represents the most direct path of liberation (grollam). Sangye Palzang's excellent commentary on the Vajra Lines gives this semantic explanation: Since that great seal {phyag rgya chen po, Skt. maha-mudra) stamps all things both animate and inanimate, anything higher than the \"seal\" does not exist, so it is \"great.\" And what is that? The lucid clear dharmakaya.\"1 Khyungpo Naljor kept the teaching ever close to his heart, liter-ally in a charm-box around his neck, and so this particular tradition is known as the \"Amulet Mahamudra\" (phyag chen gau ma) and also the mahamudra of\"Threefold Letting-Go\" (rang babs gsum ), referring to the main instruction from Niguma. It is also sometimes called the mahamudra of lucid clarity (od gsal). The distinctive feature is rest-ing the mind without any mental fabrication or contrivance, from which state realization and liberation arise naturally. Jamgon Kongtrul describes it succinctly:"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"144 • Niguma, Lady of illusion The vajra lines of the instruction on the essential mean-ing of no mental engagement were highly valued by the scholar-adept Khyungpo, such chat he rolled up the paper and inserted it into a heart·like Nepale~e amulet box, which he tied it around his neck. Thus it is known as the \"Amulet Mahamudra.\" In the preliminary of the threefold letting-go, one cultivates calm abiding and higher insight. In the main practice, the descent of vajra timeless awareness points out [mind's nature] in a sneaky way (the burglar method), and by means of the liberation of the four faults in their own ground, one becomes resolved about mind itself. In the concluding practice, one maintains the state of the naturally arisen three kayas and relies on the extraordinary enhance-ment and obstruction-dearing practices. Thus, it is the heart of all teachings of siitra and cancra, the pith of all esoteric instruction, and the actualization of the natural liberation of the four kayas in mahamudra.2 The original vajra lines attributed to Niguma are, once again, overlaid with copious interlinear notes. This time, however, one can still find the unadorned lines since almost all sources present the annotated and unannotated versions separately.1 In the Peking Tengyur, for instance, the two are not even consecutive, and the annotated version appears earlier in the volume. There is a sense chat the simple beauty of the original lines are certainly worth presenting as such, but chat it is quite difficult to gain even a basic understanding of their import without comment. So, as in the canon, I present here both versions, although I have chosen to put the unelaborated vajra lines first, and chen follow them up by the awkward but more informative annotated version. The interlinear notes have been added in smaller font, more or less as they appear in the text (given the radically different order of English sen-tence structure).

The term translated as \"integrate\" literally means \"to carry on the path\" (lam du khyer ba) and refers to a practice or attitude that one can apply during all activi-ties, not just in formal meditation. It is an attitude of mindful aware-ness that, when maintained and carried throughout daily life, makes all activities into opportunities for further insight and awakening. Uranatha explains: \"They are known as\"'branches' because they are offshoots of the threefold practice of illusory body in the Six Dharmas: for lesser, medium, and greater faculties.\"• Thus they are specifically the \"meditation-in-action\" practices of the illusory body emphasized as a separate, effective practice. Briefly, it is to view all experience as the guru, as the yidam deity, and as illusion (corresponding to greater, medium, and lesser faculties, respectively, in illusory body practice). Each of those three practices also has a component that includes the three dimensions of awakening, or kayas, in the realization: dharmakaya, sarpbhogakaya, and nirm:iQakaya. This is especially emphasized in the relatively few interlinear notes in the tengyur edition. This seems to tie into another apparent text of\"vajra lines\" that was not included in the canon editions of Niguma's works, namely: Inte-grating the Nature of Three Kayas (sKu gsum rang bzhin lam khyer) or simply Three Kaya Integration (sKu gsum lam khyer).2 It is interesting that this work seems to have all the elements of the other vajra line"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"154 • Niguma, Lady of Illusion texts, including the Sanskrit tide, the words \"I heard this talk, the uncreated natural sound, from great sarp.bhogakaya Vajradhara,\" and the usual colophon from Khyungpo Naljor (with the difference chat he states specifically practicing it for three months, and no translator is mentioned).31he contents, though by no means identical, are essen-tially similar. Our text here, on the other hand, does not contain those elements. The fact that this colophon uses the term mdzad pa (created, com-posed) uniquely among Niguma's vajra lines is discussed by Gyurme Dechen in Complete Explanation of the Vajra Lines of the Six Dharmas. 4 The use of mdzad pa seems to \"admit\" that it is in fact the work of Niguma herself rather than Vajradhara. According to Gyurme Dechen, this would designate it as \"treatise vajra lines\" (bstan bchos rdo rje'i tshig rkang) rather than \"buddha-word vajra lines\" (bka' rdo rje'i tshigrkang). In any case, Gyurme Dechen has objected to the interpretation of the opening lines, \"I heard this talk, ... and so forth\" in any of the vajra line texts as meaning that Niguma heard it from Vajradhara. Rather, he says, it means that Vajradhara himself heard or \"understood\" it, as it is com-monly understood in the Rechung Hearing Lineage and other such sources. He goes on to conclude, therefore, that since it is well known in the Shangpa tradition that these teachings of the Three Integrations were also received by Niguma from Vajradhara, they could just as well be set up in the same [wrong] way as the others! Unfortunately he does not take into account the Three Kdya Integration, which would have added another interesting twist to his argument. Aside from la.ranatha's brief comment, it is difficult to trace the sources of these teachings. The transmissions from Niguma that are listed in Khyungpo Naljor's life story mention only \"vajra lines,\" and one must assume that all of the texts bearing that name were included. Three Integrations is not specifically mentioned anywhere in his life story,s although a teaching on integrating the three kayas was one of many teachings that Khyungpo received from Maitripa.6 It is yet another mystery why this textrather than the other was inclmkd in the canon and why it came to occupy the important position in the Five Golden Dharmas.

Niguma's teachings on immortal mind that are translated here, on the other hand, employ a creation phase/mahamudra approach in first visualizing a deity and then, based on that, examining the nature of mind. This involves an introduction to or a pointing-out to oneself of the nature that was always there. The two practices together, then, form a consummate whole by including both creation and completion phases, or the two approaches known as the path ofliberation and the path of methods. Kongtrul describes the two together: Through thirty-two exercises to achieve immortality, the body enters into the path of emancipation. One's own mind that was never born is therefore deathless and attains the great natural liberation. The fully ripened body is a corpo-real collection of aggregates, so it is empty of any basis on which to designate birth and death. This means that the body occurs from the mere appearance of mind, and mind is without birth and death. When this is deeply realized, the body appears as the mahamudra of deity's form, held in the space that is not fallible by deluded appearance. There are various instructions, but [the point is that] in this life one can discover the kaya of unity. It is said that just hearing about this will result in awakening in the intermediate state as the sarpbhogakaya of the victors, and so forth.5 This edition in the tengyur has interlinear notes included, which have been replicated here also in a smaller font.

The relative brevity of this root tantra is compensated for by at least nine major explanatory tantras, further commentaries on the root text, and hundreds if not thousands of texts that instruct practitioners in the ritual components of practice, such as sadhanas, abhi!ekavidhis, and ma'f)dala-vidhis, such as we have here.2 The colophon of the mandala ritual translated here cites a tantra called Sarpvara Ocean Tantra (sDom pa rgya mtsho) as its ultimate source. This and the Jewel Ocean Tantra are said to be the main sources of all ofNiguma's teachings.3ln the Blue Annals, Roerich suggests that this obscure title may refer to the Ocean ojl)tikas Tantra,4 which is one of the major Chakrasarpvara explanatory tantras and would make much sense, but it is not at all certain. What is recorded in the Shangpa biog-raphies is that Niguma granted Khyungpo Naljor \"the empowerment of Chakrasarpvara mandala of sixty-two, thirteen, and five deities.\"5 This seems to be exactly what we have here in The Mandala Ritual of Chakrasarpvara, as the directions at the beginning of the empowerment"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"168 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion suggest. Khyungpo received transmissions of the Chakrasarpvara cycle from several of his gurus, but this has prominence of place in being directly from Niguma. The yogin! tantras, and Chakrasarpvara in particular, are associated especially with tantric sexual practices and the experiences of medita-tive bliss and other nonnormative Buddhist practices associated with the siddha movement.6 The term sa'l'(lvara7 was translated by Tibetans as both \"union\" or \"binding\" (sdom pa), and as \"sublime bliss\" (bde mchog, from famvara ), giving rise to the two names commonly used in Tibetan: Khorlo Dompa, \"Binder ofWheels:' and Khorlo Demchok \"Wheels of Bliss.\" The interpretation of the term as bliss connotes the fruition of the practice, while \"binding\" refers to the process of medi-tation. \"Wheels\" ( 'khor lo) can be synonymous with \"mandala\" (dkyil 'khor) and in the tantra refers to the visualizations of the central man-dala of Chakrasarpvara and Vajrayogini with the four direction c;lakinis, who are further surrounded by three concentric wheels-the blue mind wheel, the red speech wheel, and the white body wheel. Chakrasarpvara practice binds the wheels of the network of the dakinis in the triple wheel configuration. Simultaneously the pattern is mapped on to the practitioner's subtle energy body, with the wheels corresponding to the three chakras or converging hubs of the energy channels. This simulta-neous macrocosm-microcosm application is a signature theory of the tantras. From this description by David Gray, it can be seen that all of these elements from the root tantra are present in Niguma's two texts as well: Accordingly, the Cakrasamvara adept, who is shown the mat:J,c;lala in the context of his or her consecration, is to engage in an intensive practice of meditation which involves visualizing the maJ;~c;lala-which is thought to pervade the triple world of ancient Indian cosmology-within his or her body. The practitioner's body is linked to the larger cosmos via the three wheels of the mat:J,c;lala, which are correlated to the triple world cosmology-to the heavens, earth, and underworlds, respectively-and also the three bodies of a buddha, namely to the reality body (dharmakdya), the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Chakrasa7!'lvara .. 169 communal enjoyment body (sarrtbhogakdya), and the mani-festation body (nirmdr;akdya), respectively.8 This microcosmic or inner application to the practitioner's body is more evident in Niguma's works, which tend to emphasize the com-pletion phase practices of subtle energy control, as in her Six Dharmas. The Mandala Ritual is of course meant to be a guide for the precep-tor bestowing the empowerment or auspicious blessing for the practi-tioner to pursue the practice, as is clear not only from its contents but also its secondary appellation in the colophon as an empowerment into absorption (samddhi-abh4heka). In itself it would be employed only once by a practitioner. It is the sadhana (literally \"method of accomplishment\") Swift Accomplishment of Glorious Chakrasarrtvara that would be used as the basis for regular practice. This incorporates the three-wheel visualiza-tion as a self-visualization and purification practice. The wheel imagery is extended to include the wheels as weapons, as the meditator visual-izes a \"slicing and dicing\" effect to subdue negative forces. The results of the purification, such as the purging of toxic emotions, obscurations, disease, and so forth, are standard vajrayana fare. There is a final sec-tion for the enactment of the four modes of tantric action-peaceful, enriching, overpowering, and wrathful-which mentions, along with other benefits of the practice, several kinds of physical ailments that are eliminated. This has prompted Miranda Shaw to label the prac-tice as an unusual \"Chakrasarpvara Healing Mandala; contending that \"Niguma is the lineage founder of a specialized meditation that is designed for the healing of illness through visualizing Vajrayogini and Chakrasarpvara in sacred union.\"9 Though healing in its broadest sense is certainly a component, there are clearly much loftier benefits in mind, including nothing less than total awakening. It does not strike me as a specially designed medical sadhana, and it is not utilized that way in the Shangpa tradition. In fact, it is unfortunately not used much at all since simpler methods of practice composed by later holders of the lineage, such as iaranatha, seem to be preferred.

In his summary of mother tantras, Panchen Sonam Dragpa gen-eralizes that while the Chakrasarp.vara tantra emphasizes mainly the characteristics of the external karmamudra, or spiritual consort, and the skillful methods that rely upon union practice, the Hevajra stresses the special nature of coemergent bliss.1 That may be, but the tantra does not give that impression. In any case, the two tantras contain many of the same elements. As with Chakrasarp.vara, there is a legendary enor-mous root tantra, from which was extracted the extant Hevajra Tan-tra in Two Parts as a root text, with several explanatory tantras and commentaries and countless practice texts. Here again is a mandala rit-ual for use as the initiation process into Hevajra practice, attributed to Niguma. As discussed in the introduction, this Hevajra practice stands apart from the other texts attributed to Niguma in several ways. In the Peking Tengyur, it is in a different volume than are all of the other Niguma texts, and it is the only one ofNiguma's works that is included in the Derge Tengyur. In addition, it does not seem to have any continuity of transmission within the Shangpa tradition and is not mentioned in any of the Shangpa catalogues that have been searched. There is, however, a record ofNiguma's transmission of the two-part tantra and an empow-erment of\"Nine Emanated Deities ofHevajra\" to Khyungpo Naljor in his biography, which is repeated in Taranatha's history. 2 This is likely"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"178 ..

There is a fascinating story about Khyungpo Naljor and Hevajra told by Taranatha in The Seven Instruction Lineages.3 It concerns a master known as \"Aged Kayastha,\" the scribe of King Dharmapala, who wrote a commentary to the Hevajra tantra called Stainless Union.4 Accord-ing to the story, Khyungpo Naljor requested this commentary directly from him, and it was translated as usual by Lendarma Lodro, who attributed it to Kayastha in the colophon. This, however, does not help in tracing the Niguma lineage ofHevajra. The deity Hevajra is also important in the core Shangpa practice called Five Tantras' Deities, where he is visualized abiding in the south in the outer mandala and in the heart chakra in the inner mandala. Per-haps it was the popularity of this practice, which boasts of accomplish-ing five tantras at once, which eclipsed the separate Hevajra practice. Taranatha developed a practice text of the five tantras that utilizes the creation phase ofHevajra as the basis for all five deities.5 On the other hand, the lineage that he traces for the Hevajra tantra in the Shang-pa's five tantras does not include Niguma.6 So the presence of this text remains somewhat of a mystery, not surprisingly, as well as evoking a sense ofloss that this intriguing practice seems not to be upheld.

Then the vajra master does the cleansing and, on a comfortable seat, meditates on the creation and completion phases.

These individual exercises are known as \"trulkor\" ( 'khrul 'khor), a word that in other contexts means \"machine\" or \"device\" but is here translated simply as \"yogic technique.\" The practice of these techniques involves special clothing and housing and was traditionally kept quite secret, hidden from all viewers. The tantalizing accounts in Alexandra David-Ned's travel books of her surreptitious witnessing of strange goings-on were most likely in regard to such techniques.1 Any number of texts, commentaries, and descriptions, however, will never successfully convey the actual practice, which must be learned directly from a master who is accomplished in both the physical training and the meditation technique.

Perhaps the most central such text is, again, by the great Taranatha: Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary. \"Root\" in this case refers to a sec-tion quoted by Taranatha that appears to be the jumbled remains of what was once Niguma's outline of these practices. The commentary is Taranatha's own attempt to make sense of them. He explains: Most of these yogic exercises each have vital points of visu-alization that should be learned from the source text. These are the personal instructions of Niguma, l)akini of Time-less Awareness. They are esoteric instructions for dissolving the energy-mind in the central channel and for releasing the knots in the channels, primarily using one's own body as the method. They are the esoteric instructions for the supreme accomplishment of the path ofliberation that are known as \"The Eighteen Physical Trainings\" (lussbyongbco brgyad pa ).

Although it is possible that there are select collections assembled by uneducated persons, the practical application does not actually emerge clearly. Since I saw that the practice was close to disappearing, in order to save it and spread it, I, Taranatha, having attained some degree of devo-tion in the glorious Shangpa Kagyu, have not kept it hidden and have laid it out clearly.2 The \"vital points of visualization\" to which Taranatha refers are, at least partially, apparent in the collection translated here. Most of the cur-rently available practice manuals, on the other hand, even some illus-trated notebooks that have been in circulation at monasteries, do not include these essential visualizations.

Not recognizing itself, it is wrapped up in the darkness ofignorance. Thus it presides per-vasively as samsara's common all-base consciousness, the source of all delusion, like the basic ground or principal sovereign. Then the empty [aspect is apprehended] as \"self,\" the clarity as \"other; and attachment, aversion, stupidity, and all afflicted mentation with its associates occur from its unimpededness. Further, the natural radiance of the five [qual-ities of] original emptiness, clarity, movement, firm solidity, and con-tinuous flow occur as the appearance of extremely subtle five lights: blue, red, green, yellow, and white. On that basis, then, arise the appear-ances of the five elements: space, fire, wind, earth, and water. The one [experiencing] these deluded appearances in that way is the aggre-gate of consciousness, and based on that, first a mental body arises, and then in relation to it, feeling, perception, and formation: four and a half aggregates. Mixing with external elements, such as the father's semen and the mother's blood, the coarse physical form of a fully rip-ened corporeal body consisting of the five elements as orifices, warmth, breath, flesh, and blood is achieved, and the six faculties of the eyes,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"2.00 ,.

Based on that, like the sover-eign's heir, the unvirtuous afflicted mentation arises from the aspect of consciousness and virtuous mentation such as faith, compassion, and wisdom arise from the aspect of timeless awareness. Like their emis-saries, the six kinds of consciousness arise, and the six objects of form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and (mental] phenomena (appear] to them. Then the prince-like afflicted mentation presides over the conference with the six sense faculties, six objects, and six consciousnesses, and a whole host of interdependent causes and conditions are convened. The bodies, speech, and minds of hundreds and thousands of deluded con-cepts are consigned into service and perform various acts. Habitual pat-terns, like seeds, are planted in the all-base consciousness, which is like the basic ground. For instance, to grow crops one must assemble many dependent conditions such as water, fertilizer, warmth, moisture, and the seeds to produce the cause and result. Similarly, assembling the var-ious dependent causes and conditions for the seeds of one's previous actions will result in the higher realms and liberation from virtuous causes, and samsara and lower realms from unvirtuous causes."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Appendix 2: The Tibetan Text of Stages in the Path of Illusion and the Commentarf -~~ ~~·~~·~~·~~ 0-J'tQ'~·~·:u·0-!·~·0-11 q~·~~·~l ~'0-]' 11.10-I'~·~O-J·~·~~rs·.z:]l ~r;~·~~·~r;·sr;·~z:].~O-J~·~~~·~O-J~·;s~·a.l· ~~·~~11.1·~11~~\\~~·~r;·.z:]~~·~~·~~(.l.l·qii~~~·~~~·O-I·~~· ~ ~ ~-C\\~ C\\--~r;·~~·.1r;'l o.]~'z:],1~·~~·~·l~'tQ 11\"'~0-1~·~~ '15~'11.1'~~·~~11.1'11.11 ~~(.l.l·q·~·O-I~·~~~·~·q~~~~t::J~~·sa·~r;·q~·~~·~·~ll~·~·(.l.lO-J' ~·~0-l·~·~~ll~'¥\\·a.l·t:.~~·~~·~~·~~·sii~·O-I·~~~·~~·O-I·~z:]·~l '£r~·~·~~·~a·~sr;~·~~·~~~i'~·~O-I~·\\l~·~·~·~~·~~~t::J~·~~~· ~r;·q·~~·.z:]~r;·~,,~r;·af\\l~·~~~·~~~·~~,,i'~·~0-]~'~'0-]'~'~'11.11 -C\\ --~~~·q~~·!{l~·~~·~a;~·~~·~~~~~·O-I·~·~~·~~~·s~·~ll~·~·~· ~~·~~~·~r;~·~~~~~'tQT;'(.l.l0-]'~'~·~·~0-I~,,at~~·~~·~l·~~· 1.

Based on an initial listing by PrajiiiraSmi ( 1 s 17-1 s 84), it was developed primarily by the great Tibetan savant Jamgan Kong-trul Lodro Taye ( 1813-1900) as a doxographical tool in his great efforts to preserve the histories and teachings of all those lineages by collecting and printing them in the large compendiums known as his Five Great Treasuries. He enumerates these eight chariots as (1) Nyingma, (:z.) Kadam, (3) Lamdre, (4) Marpa Kagyu.

Buddhist Savants of Kashmir, 49· 10 See, for example, the recounting of this tale by Bu-ston, translated by Obermiller in The History ofBuddhism in India and Tibet, 89-91. One of a group of Ananda's disci-ples called Madhyii.ntika is prophesied by Ananda to be the future settler of Kashmir, \"the place suitable for mystic absorption and the best resting-place.\" In fulfillment of that prophecy, the events of the story unfold more or less as related here. In terms of the drastic environmental change in the geography of Kashmir that resulted, the .time of the previous buddha might be more appropriate. See also n. 6s. 11 Nii.ropa's dates are given as fire-dragon to iron-dragon year, which would be 9s6-1040. Atisha's departure for Tibet is reliably dated to 1040, and he brought relics from the cremation ofNaropa with him. The stiipa in which they are enshrined still survives in Nethang Dolma Lhakang temple, founded by Atisha. According to Peter Roberts's introduction in Mahamudra and Related Instructions, the common errone-ous dates of 1016-1100 (such as in Guenther, The Lift and TeachingofNaropa) were the result of taking literally an episode in Tsangnyon Heruka's version of the life of Marpa in which he visits Nii.ropa. However it turns out that the visit and Naropa's song are derived from one ofTsangnyon's visions and are without historical basis. 12. See Guenther, The Lift and Teaching ofNaropa, xi-xii, which has the following infor-mation: born into the Shii.kya clan, brahmin caste, his father was named Zhi ba go cha (Shii.ntivarman) and mother dPal gyi blo gros (Shrimati), who was the daughter of the great king sKalldan grags pa. They had only one daughter, the princess dPal gyi ye shes (Shrijiiii.na). Nii.ropa's wife was Dri med pa (Vimala), whose mother was the Brahmini Nigu. (Note that the Sanskrit names are reconstructions from the Tibetan.) These names accord with those given in the biography by Karmapa Rangjung Dorje ( 12.84-1 33 9 ). However in The Lift Story of the Supreme Learned Naro Pa7.1chen by Sangye Bum, the father's name is given as the brahmin dGe ba bzang po, and his mother's name as the brahmin! dPal gyi ye shes ( 89-90; £ u6-b 1 ), which in other places is actually the daughter's name. 13 The earliest biographies ofNaropa, such as that ofGampopa ( 1079-11 S3) and Lama Zhang ( 112.3-1193), do not name a specific birthplace other than simply \"the west: All accounts ofNiiropa include the story of a c;lii.kini appearing to him and telling him to \"go east• to find his guru Tilopa, which really only makes sense if he is somewhere in the west. In The Lift Story of the Supreme Learned Naro Pa1'}chen, which claims to have compared five different biographies, Sangye Bum ( 8 8) gives Nii.ropa's birthplace as the \"land ofMoslems· (kha che'i yul), which is almost universally interpreted to mean Kashmir. (Recall that Moslems gained control ofKashmir in the fourteenth cenmry.) In case this is not clear, Karmapa Rangjung Dorje ( 12.84-1 339) specifies \"ka smi ra:· transcribing the Indian \"Kashmir\" as nearly as is possible in Tibetan in his version of the life story in the Kagyu Golden Rosary, £ 2.6a2..

Srinagar and Jammu are easily identified in the southeastern part of the Kashmir valley. In the Tibetan dictionary, Bangala is identified as an early Tibetan name for Zahor (usu-ally located in northwest India), which, it says, is currently called \"Ca Ia.\" BD, vol. 2., 2.444. The biography by Lhatsun Rinchen Namgyal (1473-1557), called The Amaz-ing, Wonderful Lift ofNdropa, which was translated by Herbert Guenther in The Lift and Teaching ofNaropa. is a verbatim copy ofKhacho Wangpo's, a very common prac-tice in Tibetan literature, where plagiarism is truly the highest form of flattery. Dorje Dze-o's biography ofNaropa, translated by Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen in The Great Kagyu Masters, has the same information. It seems that it is only because of the inex· plicable identification of the Tibetan transliteration \"Bha-ga-la\" as \"Bengal\" in these two translations (despite the obvious reference to Srinigar and Jammu) that Naropa has been widely viewed in the Western world as Bengali. Later Tibetan authors such as Taranatha have upheld Kashmir as his birthplace. One last twist to this research is that Sangye Bum's description of \"the land of Moslems.\" identical to the one in Niguma's life story, adds that it is also called \"Kosala\"! Rwalung Kagyu Golden Rosary, 89 (f. 2.a6). This ancient kingdom where the Buddha Shakyamuni spent most of his teaching life is nowhere near Kashmir or Bengal, but somewhere in the middle. This seems to come out of nowhere, and I have no explanation for it. On Naropa's birth-place see also Jo nang Taranatha, The Seven Instruction Lineages, 46 and 1 1 5, n. 1 s 7· 14 For example, in his translation of the Blue Annals, George Roerich notes that modern Tibetan pilgrims believe the location of Pullahari (alternately called Pu~hpahari) to be in Kashmir near Srinagar (4oo). And more interestingly, the colophon to Tilopa's Esoteric Instructions on the Six Yo gas ( Chos drug gi man ngag) states that it was trans-lated by Naropa and Marpa in Pu~hpahari in the place of the Moslems (kha che'i gnas), again referring to Kashmir (Toh. 2.330, f. 2.71a2.-3). 1 s Guenther, \"Introduction.\" The Lift and Teaching ofNaropa, xi-xii. 16 \"Na ro pa'i /cam mo.· Go Lotsawa, The Blue Annals, vol. 2., 854 and again on 85s; Roerich, The Blue Annals, vol. 2., 730. 17 Losang Chokyi Nyima, Collected Works of bLo bzang chos-kyi nyi·ma, vol. 2., f. 3a 1. 18 Jamgon Kongtrul.

Another accounting of his name reports that Ananda went to pass away on an island in the Ganges midway between two groups who wanted his remains. A rti {sage) with live hundred dis-ciples came and requested to enter the order. At midday in the middle island he attained arhant, so he was named Madhyantika. See Cook, Light of Liberation, I70. Madhyantika is credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Kashmir in the third century BCE. A good account of this legend can be found in Obermiller's translation ofBu-ston's The History of Buddhism in India and Tibet, 89-9I. There is also a short account in Taranacha, Ttirantitha's History of Buddhism in India, 2.9-3 3, and another in Roe rich, BA, 2. 3 that Go Lotsawa translated from \"a stray page from an Indian text on the hierarchy of the Doctrine.\" Jamgon Kongcrul praises Niguma as \"emanated from Madhyantika's blessing.\" Garland ofUdumbara, 3bi. 66 Naga are said to be subterranean beings.

This alteration may have been due to the rivalry with the Hinayanists, who had devised the Pa.li formula of the ten paramis ....

Or it may refer to the three times of sleep, dream, and intermediate state mentioned above, where this vision of sa111bhogakaya occurs (this according to Lama lharchin Rinpoche), or to the immediately following mention of \"illusion, deity's Bodies, and manifest clarity.\" In Taranii.tha's teachings on blending day and night, there are three times of dawn, dusk, and evening to train one's intention, and there are also three applications of the blending: to dreams, to illusory body, and to lucid clar-ity.

The metaphor refers to the myth that geese (sometimes translated as \"s~an; though they did not exist in India) can drink diluted milk while extracting only the milk from the water. The line in some texts, (such as STand the tengyurs) reads \"like a goose in a lake\" (ngang pas mtsho La o ma len pa !tar), but since this breaks the meter by two syllables, it appears to be a later insertion. 63 \"Arhats with or without adornments\" means with or without clairvoyance (mngon shes). As defined by Kongtrul, they \"possess dissipating miraculous abilities of their own ground, such as clairvoyance\" (rang sa'i zag bcas kyi rdzu 'phrul gyi mngon shes sogs dang !dan pa) (RY).

The lan-guage of the \"eight consciousness groups\" (rnam shes tshogs brgyad) developed in the later siitras of the third turning (ATG, September I 3o 2007 ). 9 5 According to ATG, consciousness here refers to all six consciousnesses (tshogs drug). 96 journey to Lanka Sutra (Toh.

The views about the transitory col-lection is to regard the live aggregates (;hung po; Skt. skandha) as an autonomous self, clinging either to \"me\" or \"mine.\" The fixation on extremes refers to clinging to a personal identity as permanent and durable, or as something that is annihilated at death. Perverse views means to deny the existence of things that exist, such as karmic causes and results or future lives. Holding views as paramount means to cling to any of the wrong views of non-Buddhists as the best. Holding one's ethical discipline and deliberate conduct as paramount means to cling to them as being pure, excellent, and the path of liberation from suffering. 142. The above list of six afHictive states becomes five since the last one, \"views,\" has itself been subdivided into five.

It is important to remember the bivalent meaning of\"sa\" ( Skt. bhumi) as both \"level\" and literally as \"ground\" or \"earm.\" An early commentary by Vasubandhu, Explanation of the Ornament of the Sutras (Toh. 4026), 2S s b7-2s 6a2. glosses as follows: Since [the ground) makes measureless elcmcntals fearless, [and) since for mose measureless ones [the grounds] arc endowed wim progress while going higher, therefore mose dwelling places are called \"grounds.\" It says \"since [the grounds) make measureless elementals fearless\" because the fear of measureless elementals is eliminated. It says \"those measureless ones\" because each [of those) is also immeasurable. It says \"are endowed with progress while going higher\" because [ mey are 1 endowed with [the poten-tial of) going to the higher grounds. But this is still not entirely clear until we read Mipam's commentary in the Complete Explanation of the Intended Meaning of\"Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras:\" Why arc they called grounds? The term bhumi [in Sanskrit connotes) that since in the world [me ground) is me support for measureless elemental sentient beings, as well as grasses and trees and forests and so on, and since they rely on that [ground], they have no fear offalling.

The higher and higher grounds arc the places of measureless qualities, [and] since those situations have [the potential] to become the support for journeying or going progressively higher and higher, they arc the dwelling places ofbodhisatrvas. Therefore they arc held to be \"grounds.\" { Colit:cud 1%rkr, vol. 1, 745-46; £ 374a6-b3) Finally, in the Treasury of Knowledgt:, vol. 3, 496, Jamgon Kongtrul adds some more description, which would lend itself to an interpretation of the first line as a list of possible word derivations: The Sanskrit equivalent is bhumi. One arrives at the general hermeneutical etymologies of \"ground\" through the certainties that derive from delet-ing or adding [certain] syllables. Bhu derives from bhuta {Tib. 'byung po, that is., clements or the beings composed of clements) for, like the great elements, these grounds serve as supports for the amassing of positive qualities. Mi derives from amita, meaning \"measureless\" (dpag mt:d} since they arc attained through measureless hardships. Alternatively, bhu derives from abhaya, meaning \"fearless\" (Jigs mt:d), since once one has attained these grounds, one has eliminated the five fears, and so on. Or, bhu derives from bhuya{s} which means \"progress\" (;hyi phyir), since one progresses by journeying higher and higher based on what preceded. So the term \"ground\" implies something that serves as a support. In brief. then, the general derivation of the term \"ground\" comes from using this word as a referent, since these grounds, similar to the earth as a foundation, serve as supports for positive qualities. 164 This line in the siitra (rab tu dga' ba cht:n po skyt: bas) is not in the Niguma texts and has been added here. 165 This phrase (mtshan ma mt:d pa yid Ia byed pa med pa'i), on the other hand, is not found in the edition of the siiua that was consulted, or in the Kinnaur edition, which in general seems to be closer to the the siitras. 1 66 The siitra has shes rab {wisdom) here rather than ye shes {timeless awareness), but I have kept ye sht:s since it was developed on the previous ground.

This is an explanatory tantra of the Yoga Tantras. In the tantra, this verse answers the question \"Where docs this secret arise?\" (gsang ba 'di ni gang du byung), and in fact the word for imperishable (Jig med pa) is perhaps misspelled there as \"fearless\" (Jigs med pa). 191 This discussion attempts to resolve the apparent contradiction in the statement (above from the Secret Moon Drop Tantra) that the Buddha abandons the Pure Domains (Tsangs pa'i gnas) before attaining the state of a buddha in Akaninha ('Og min). It would seem to indicate that the Pure Domains are actually impure and separable from Akani~~ha, which is pure or permanent. Here it is maintained that Akaninha is the highest or best part of the Pure Domains (actually the fifth of five grounds), and thus both are imperishable and pure from the pure perspective. Longchenpa discusses this in An Excellent Chariot, 3 5a4-36az., before present-ing this quote. There, he presents a different view that almost seems like a response: \"In any case, what is this Akani~tha ofbuddhahood? Some believe that this is the Akaninha of the Pure Domains, but that does not make sense, because [it says that] the Pure Domains are abandoned. Some say that it is [a distance] from the Akani~tha of the Pure Domains [as] a hermitage is just a distance away from the town, but that does not make sense because it is described as \"without direction or extent.\" Here [in the Net of Magical Manifestation] it is explained that the primordial Buddha's natural pure manifestation is the Akani~tha of pure awareness, so one finds the kayas and timeless awareness as one in basic space.\" It may be helpful to think of three kinds of Akani~~ha: ( 1) the ultimate Akani~~ha, that is, the formless state of the dharmakaya, ( 2.) the Densely Arrayed Akaninha (Tib. 'Ogmin rgyan stugpo bkod pa; Skt.

A similar statement by Taranatha on the purity of the tradition was quoted earlier, in the main introduction. 4 Loch en Gyurme Dechen ( 1 540-161 s) was recognized as an emanation of Maitripa and was considered the lineage holder of the vajralines afi:er Kunga Drolchok (1 S07-I s66).

His personal focus was on the Kalachakra practices and the teachings of the Shangpa Kagyu. While he studied with many teachers of different traditions, he received the instructions of Niguma from Kunga Drolchok. His most enduring work is the definitive biography of Tang-tong Gyalpo, which is translated in Stearns, King of the Empty Plain. See that book for more on him, especially 8-11. Also see Zangpo. Timeless Rapture, 168-69, for Gyurme Dechen's beautiful supplication to Niguma. Atisha's sojourn there before proceeding to Central Tibet is well known. It was at Tholing (Tho ling, but more properly mtho gding, as in Roerich, BA, 2.48, or Taranatha's unusual mton mting in Clearing Up Darkness of the Mind, 463; £ z.4a2.), the residence of Rinchen Zan gpo, that he composed his famous Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, the prototype for the many later works of this \"path-stages\" genre (lam rim) composed by Tibetan authors. Considering the story here in Khyungpo Naljor's biography, it is interesting to speculate as to whether Atisha also had access to an even earlier prototype, namely, Stages in the Path of ILlusion, either his own copy or that of Khyungpo, who would certainly have carried it with the Vajra Lines that he had received at the same time from Niguma. Unfortunately, the biography does not tell us which texts exactly were at issue.

Gyurme Dechen had a great deal to say about this initial verse in his Complete Explanation of the liajra Lines of the Six Dhar-mas. According to him, it is here a misreading of the exact same phrase that appears in other source materials such as Naropa, liajra Lines of the Hearing Lineage (Toh. 2.338), f. 302.b6. There, it is understood to mean that Vajradhara himself heard this talk and that \"heard\" really means \"to understand\" (mkhyen pa) or \"to realize\" (rtogs pa). The compilers of the Shangpa texts then rendered it to mean that Niguma heard it from Vajradhara as a way to verify the Shangpa story line. Gyurme Dechen says, \"Therefore, the explanation that someone 'heard this talk; the unborn natural sound of the great vehicle' means that Niguma heard [it from] Vajradhara should be under-stood as a sign offabrication\" (ST, 8, 489). He then goes on to present his reasoning in hair-splitting detail that will be of considerable interest to determined scholars. This and the many other questions that Gyurme Dechen raises concerning the Shangpa texts-all gathered in his {Questions concerning} the Instructions of Glorious Niguma, Mighty Kechari, and again in Complete Explanation of the liajra Lines of the Six Dhar-mas-in no way seemed to dampen his own faith in the lineage. I suspect that it was this seeming skepticism that made his work \"meet with an ambivalent response in the Shangpa Tradition,\" rather than his \"wordy presentation of the path,\" as Ngawang Zangpo suggests in Timeless Rapture • 344· 1 4 kha 'byor is glossed in the interlinear note as the joining of bliss-emptiness or appear-ance-emptiness, indicating the dharmakaya. 1 s All three kayas are presented in these first lines; \"arising to tame anyone\" indicates nirmiQakaya. 1 6 The note says \"possessed of seven branches\" (yan lag bdun dang /dan pa ). If these are the seven branches of enlightenment contained in the thirty-seven factors, then they are mindfulness, revealing phenomena, diligence, joy, agility, absorption, and equanimity (see the comments on verses 84-91 in Stages in the Path of Illusion: The"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"290 ..

More commonly, Vajradhara is described as having seven aspects of union (kha sbyor bdun !dan): (r) complete enjoyment (longs spyod rdzogs pa), (l) union (kha sbyor), (3) great bliss (bde ba chen po), (4) no intrinsic nature (rang bzhin med pa ), ( s) completely filled with compassion (snying rjes yongs su gang ba ), ( 6) unin-terrupted (rgyun mi chad pa), and (7) unceasing (gog pa med pa).

The great bliss, the cause (rgyu, not sku as in DZ and S:i} of attaining the unity tif no {more} train-ing, (is} the practice of the dissipating and nondissipatingfour joys in descending (in GD-CW only) and ascending order, and the cause for those to arise, which is the vital points tifthe body and steady gazes, causes bliss and clarity and non thought, those three as an inseparable unity, to arise naturally. The preliminary and main and concluding practices [are] adorned by the vital points of time.\" 3 s Again it is not clear whether it is part of the original vajra lines. In commentaries, such as those by Tangrong Gyalpo and Gendun Gyatso (Mullin, The Dalai Lamas on Tantra, 143-46), it is not part of the vajra lines. In GD-CW. DZ, and ST, the first line \"lucid clarity is recognized ... consummated\" appears as commentary. The last two lines are in regular letter size with their own interlinear notes, as follows: \"A holy guru who has actualized in direct experience the lucid clarity that abides since forever, introduces the experience ('char sgo) tif the disciple's lucid clariry, and it is adorned by enhancement and clearing away obstacles.\" 36 These are the names of the different types of transference in the tradition ofNiguma, described individually in Taranatha, Profound Meaning Expanded, ST. vol. 3, 484-89. As he mentions, however, the transference most commonly practiced in the tradi-tion is called \"skylight of timeless awareness\" (ye shes skar khung ma). 3 7 These two lines also appear as part of the verses, though, as before, they are not quoted in the commentaries. With the interlinear notes, they read: \"The vital point of certain time is the arising of the signs tif death; the vital points of the body are cross-legged, squatting, etc.; the vital point of speech is to train in blending transference by, as is said, 'the intense shout tiftwo and a half/etters' [that is, phat] along with the sound tifhik; the vital point of substance is to anoint the crown of the head with red and white bodhi-chitta, salt, and human brains. • This last rather interesting note reads byang sems dkar dmar 'tshalla mi'i glad pa rnams sbyi bor byugs pa.

According to the notes, those of highest acumen can be liberated in the first intermediate state after the three stages of light or appearance, the spreading of it, and the culmination of it (snang mched thob gsum), when lucid clarity is recognized. Those of medium capacity recognize the deity's body of saqtbhogakaya in the second intermediate state. Those of the least capacity should tty to block rebirth by repulsion for the samsaric process, so that attraction and aversion and jealousy toward one's future parents during intercourse is refined away by the transformations of the lucid clarity as deities' bodies. 39 According to Tangtong Gyalpo, Collection of the Essentials, 332., weariness or revul-sion with samsara is the vital point for all three kinds of best, medium, and least practitioners for the intermediate state after death, so one should apply the three integrations of practicing all phenomena as the guru, the yidam, and as illusion. See chapter 4 of this volume for the English translation of the Three Integrations. 40 Heresnangbyed should besnang mched (as in ST, I70; f. sb4), again referring to the three lights or three \"appearances\" or \"experiences\" (snang ba gsum) at the time of death that begin after the dissolution of the senses (forms, sounds, and so on) and ele-ments (water, earth, and so forth).ln progressive or arising order they are light (snang ba), increase of the light (snang ba mched pa), and culmination of light (snang ba thob pa). When the true nature of mind as lucid clarity is not recognized, it shifts to three coarser phases of appearance in reverse order: culmination, increase, and light. See Jamgon Kongtrul's extensive discussion of the three lights in TOK, 2., 689-707 or The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Six, Part Four: Systems of Buddhist Tantra, 2. s I -72.. 4 I rang bzhin brgyad bcu'i rtogpa: The three lights become subject to and veiled by eighty conceptions or \"natures\" (rang bzhin, Skt. prakrti). They are called \"natures\" because they are the nature or obscuring transformations of the three lights. As mentioned in the interlinear notes, they are the seven conceptions of delusion indicative of the cul-mination oflight, the forty of desire indicative of the increase oflight, and the thirty-three of aversion indicative of light. In the final stages of the death process, or in the yogic realization of reversing the three lights, the eighty conceptions dissolve. They are listed and discussed extensively in relation to the three lights in Kongrrul, TOK, 2., 689-707 or The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Six, Part Four: Systems of Buddhist Tantra, 2.5 I -72.. Tangtong Gyalpo also offers an excellent description in Collection of Essentials, 3I7-2.S (ff. 39as-43bi). 42. A reference: to the common unethical behavior of selling watered-down milk. Tang-tong Gyalpo says: \"those bloated dharma practitioners who mostly are like merchants that sell milk polluted with water.\" Collection of Essentials, 3 34 (f. 47~). 43 The notes elaborate that personal practice experience, the scriptures of the Victor's authentic word that have five aspects or branches, and the directories (them yig) arc to be cherished. This last is likely a reference to the directory attributed to Niguma that Khyungpo Naljor assembled, called Directory of the Vajra Lines of the Six Dharmas, which clearly lists the sequence of practice of these teachings. 44 Here is the famous injunction ofNiguma's to keep the teachings secret for \"seven gen-erations.\" This would actually be just four more after Khyungpo Naljor, ending with Drogon Sangye Tonpa.

Aside from the obvious difference in chu (water) rather than mchu (lips), there is the verb bsdus pa (to gather) or bsdud pa (dissolve). Although this version is not clear, it is possible that these were special instructions pertaining to the body, since rtsa chu can refer to the pulse and the urine or, alternatively, to feces and urine. That chu (water) is not a mistake for mchu (lips) here is also perhaps supported by the fact that \"lips\" is not misspelled in the very next line of any version (except in CT, where it is ma). However, there is no commentary to clarify this.

It is translated from the Sanskrit in Farrow and Menon, The Concealed Essmu of the Hevajra Tantra, 2. 72.-73. There are some differences in the Tibetan with the Nigurna text. The only one that is significant in meaning is where the Niguma text has mnyam med kye'i rdo rje ston, \"teacher incomparable Hevajra.\" the source text (Rumtek edi-tion and ACIP, rGyud Ka, 374b) reads smyo med kye yi rdo rje ston: literally \"teach-ing Hcvajra unintoxicated\" (sober Hevajra?). The commentary by Jamgon Kongtrul explains this as referring to the person carrying the sacred pledge, who is \"not intrinsi-cally reckless, with unrestricted conduct of the three doors, whose mind docs not rest in its native state due to being bloated with pride over their clan lineage.\" Rumtek edi-tion, If. 2.99a4-30oas.

ST, vol. 8, 742.-44. This is probably the source of exercises s. 6, and 7 in Niguma's eighteen yogic exercises. See Taranatha's Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary. 8 rlung gi 'khor /o thur du bshig. In Taranarha's commentary, the apparently equivalent phrase reads \"Scare down the downward-dearing [priQ.a] and draw up the life-force [pril).a]\" (mthur sel mthurdu bsdigpa dang/ srog {rlung} stengdu drang). ST, vol. 6, 1 so (f. 4b6). This brings together the two kinds of praQ.a (\"downward clearing\" and \"life force\") in the middle, a very common yogic method. Here it is expressed as join-ing the two wheels of praQ.a and fire. It is a puzzling use of the word bshig, literally \"to destroy\" or \"demolish,\" and I can only assume that it is an alternate usage mean-ing roughly \"to bear down\" or \"push.\" The exact wording is also used in another of Niguma's instructions for straightening the channels in the collection of yogic exer-cises in the Shangpa Texts, but without the intervening line concerning placement of the hands. ST. vol. 8, 740 (f. 62.bs-6). 9 a ba dhu ti,left in transliterated Sanskrit; it is the name for the central channel (Tib. rtsa dbu ma).

I2. rdo rje gar: In Taranatha's Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary, the vajra dance is said to consist of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth ofNiguma's eigh-teen yogic exercises, that is, the exercises to help insert, guide, and gather the vital essence into the central channel. Sometimes the two exercises for opening the central channel are also included in the vajra dance, but that does not seem to be the case here. ST. vol. 6, Iss (f. 7as-6). 13 In CT, vol. 42., 9S4-s6 (2.s2.8) as l)aki'i zhal gdams dug gsum zhi byed (l)akini's Personal Instruction on Pacification of the Three Poisons). These exercises altogether correspond to the eighteenth of Niguma's eighteen yogic exercises as described in Taranatha, Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary, where they are called \"Yogic Exercises for Clearing away Afflictive States.\" ST. vol. 6, I s6-S9· 1 4 These headings are added for clarification based on Taranatha's commentary, Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary. As is often the case in Tibetan literature, there are issues with the enumeration. First of all, the tide in CT,l)akims Personal Instruction on Pacification of the Three Poisons, clearly involves a miscount since there are more than three poisons. Then, in Taranatha's text, which includes what might be taken as the source text, it is clearly stated that the last or eighteenth exercise in Niguma's eighteen yogic exercises can be divided into eight parts, and if added sepa-rately then there are said to be twenty-five in all. The only problem is that Taranatha presents nine divisions, and that is how it is currently practiced in the lineage. In the"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"304 .. Niguma, Lady of Illusion text here, one might count only eight if numbers five and six are not separated, as they appear not to be in the original (without reference to Taraniitha's commentary). But in order to offer a practical correspondence to the current tradition, I have used the nine exercises here. 1 s 'dug stangs: Although the term for \"sitting position\" is used here, which would nor-mally mean the sevenfold posture of Vairochana, Taraniitha's description of these exercises specifies \"mudra\" (hand gesture) in this and the following exercises. Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary, ST, vol. 6, 156 (f. 7b2). 16 mnyam bzhag phyag rgya: this is also known as the mudra of Amitabha, as it is called by Taraniitha, Nigu's Yogic Exercises, Root and Commentary, ST, vol. 6, 1 s 7 (£ 8as). 17 'dom gsum chod pa, but in Taraniitha's version it is \"eight\": 'doms Jal brgyad. Ibid.,£ 8b3. 1 8 lkog gis fangs, is spelled variously as kag gis langs or kog gyis langs (this last one with its meaning of\"suddenly\" makes the most sense). \"With a hop,\" though not in the dictionary, comes from the oral tradition and must be the meaning of the phrase. Taraniitha adds that kog langs is in fact the name of this exercise. 19 In ST. vol. 8, 745-46 as rkyang bskum (Extend and Contract). These instructions seem to correspond to exercises 8 through 12 of Niguma's eighteen yogic exercises, although the first two are no longer in use in this form. 2.0 Concerning these exercises, which correspond to exercises 8 and 9 ofNiguma's eigh-teen yogic exercises, Taranatha comments: • It says in the source that these two, the eighth and nimh, [involved) first grabbing hold of a staff with one hand and then afterward grabbing hold with two and lifting off to a distance, so it was considered \"pole vaulting\" (dbyug mchong byed pa). However these days this practice is not done.\" ST, vol. 6, 152. (£ sb 3-5). The description here, then, represents the earlier practice and is not thus described in later works, making it impossible to verify my interpretation. 2.1 pus mo'i gnyan gong dag tu sbyar (S1j is better than pus mo snyan gong dag du sbyar (join the knee to the ear)! CT. 2.2. bu chung 'khrul'khor, also called bu chung tshul (the manner of a small child), is the eleventh ofNiguma's eighteen yogic exercises, involving rotating the head. 2.3 laggsum (CT) should be langsum (S1j.
