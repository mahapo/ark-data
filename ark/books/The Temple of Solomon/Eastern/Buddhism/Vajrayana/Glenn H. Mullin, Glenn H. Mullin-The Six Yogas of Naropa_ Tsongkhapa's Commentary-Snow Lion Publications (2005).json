I generally use \"the Six Yogasof Naropa,\" or simply \"the Six Yogas,\" because these are the forms best known toWestern readers. Occasionally I resort to the more literal \"Naro's Six Dharmas,\"although whenever I do so I enclose the phrase in quotation marks in order toindicate that I am honoring the Tibetan form of the name, Naro Choe Druk.Tibetan literature randomly refers to the illustrious Indian Buddhist masterafter whom this tradition is named as Naro, Naropa, and Naropada (born 1016).Naropa was a disciple of the Indian mahasiddha Tilopa (b. 988). The lineagesthat Naropa gave to his Tibetan lay-disciple Marpa Lotsawa (lit. \"MarpaTranslator\"; b. 1012), especially that of the Six Yogas, came to pervadethousands of monasteries and hermitages throughout Central Asia, regardless ofsect. This is certainly true within all the Sarmai Choeluk, or \"New Schools,\"such as the Kadampa, Kargyupa, Sakyapa, Jonangpa and Gelukpa. In addition, theSix Yogas have also gradually become absorbed into most of the Nyingma Choeluk,or \"Older Schools.\"The treatise on the system written by Tsongkhapa the Great (1357- 1419)-A Bookof Three Inspirations: A Treatise on the Stages of Training in the Profound Pathof Naro's Six Dharmas-is regarded as one of the finest on the subject to comeout of the Land of Snows. Lama Tsongkhapa was the forefather of the Gelukpaschool (Tib. dGe lugs; lit. \"Order of Excellence\"), which quickly swept acrossCentral Asia and became the largest single school of tantric Buddhism. He wasalso the guru of the First Dalai Lama (b. 1391). His treatise has served as thefundamental guide to the system of the Six Yogas of Naropa as practiced in themore than three thousand Gelukpa monasteries, nunneries and hermitages acrossCentral Asia over the past five-and-ahalf centuries.The Gelukpa lineage came down over the generations to the present day. Theprincipal transmission holder, when I arrived in India in 1972, was KyabjeyTrijang Rinpochey, the Junior Tutor of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. He in turnpassed it to numerous disciples.I was in Dharamsala in 1973 when Kyabjey Rinpochey delivered his lasttransmission on Naropa's Six Yogas. At the time I was studying Tibetan language,philosophy and meditation at the Buddhist Studies Program initiated by H. H. theDalai Lama as part of the activities of his recently established Library ofTibetan Works and Archives in Dharamsala. A few months into the program it wasannounced that the Junior Tutor to His Holiness, the very venerable and veryelderly Kyabjey Trijang Rinpochey, would be giving a teaching in the museumroom, the largest space in the building. The subject would be the Six Yogas ofNaropa, and the recipients would be a large group of Tibetan yogis, hermits,monks and nuns. We Westerners couldn't attend, but if we liked we could sit inan adjoining room and listen through the sound system.The Dalai Lama's Junior Tutor was considered to be one of the greatest livingmasters to come out of Tibet, and was regarded as a living buddha by the Tibetancommunity. News of his discourse had travelled throughout the refugeecommunities of India and Nepal, and great lamas began to roll into town from alldirections. One monk who was pointed out to me was said to have spent more thanforty years in meditation in the mountains. There were dozens of others withtwenty or more years of solitary retreat under their belts.Rinpochey spoke six hours a day for many, many days, using the text of LamaTsongkhapa as his focus. One day one of the yogis coming out of the room at theend of a session looked at me and said, \"Really, what a buddha he is!\"When this great lama passed away a few years later, the Tibetan spiritualcommunity mourned the loss of one of the last of the supergreats to come out ofTibet. When I think back twenty-two years ago to the faces in the front coupleof rows at that teaching, many of them have today come to rank among theforemost lamas in the Gelukpa school.Essentially there are two main ways to teach Tsongkhapa's A Book of ThreeInspirations: by means of a shey tri (Tib. bshad 'khrid), or \"explanatorydiscourse\"; and by means of a nyam tri (Tib. nyams 'khrid), or \"experientialdiscourse.\" The former is what is most often received first. Usually this kindof teaching is given by a senior lama at a large public gathering, and entails aword-for-word reading and explanation of the text. The discourse of KyabjeyTrijang Rinpochey belongs to this latter category, as does the teaching Ireceived from His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 1990.Those who have attended a public teaching of the text and want to pursue thetraining will arrange to receive the second type of teaching, the \"experientialdiscourse,\" which is given more privately. Here all philosophical and historicaldiscussions are set aside, and the focus instead is placed on the actual yogicand meditative applications. This was the teaching style in Gelukpa practicehermitages; the resident teacher would impart a few pages of the text, and thedisciples would then meditate for a few weeks or months on the material that hadbeen covered. Only when the teacher felt that the desired inner experiences hadbeen generated would he teach the next section of the text. Most practitionersreceiving an \"experiential teaching\" of the text from their personal lama wouldalready have received the \"explanatory teaching,\" together with the appropriateempowerments, from a senior lineage lama.[../Images/img0001.jpg]Tsongkhapa's treatise was published in English-in an edition riddled withhundreds of errors-by Dr. C. A. Muses and Garma C. C. Chang in 1961 (EsotericTeachings of the Tibetan Tantras, Falcon Wing's Press, 1961). Because thetreatise itself is of considerable importance, the editorial staff at Snow LionPublications felt it imperative that a more accurate rendition be prepared. Theyapproached me with the request to accept responsibility for the project.To prepare the first draft, I listened through the tapes of a reading ofTsongkhapa's text given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala in 1990,which I had had the good fortune to attend. Although this was a wonderfulteaching, it was of limited value for translation purposes, as it was not a\"word-for-word commentary\" (Tib. tshig 'khrid), but rather was a \"meaningcommentary\" (Tib. don 'khrid). Therefore I undertook a private reading of thetext with Geshey Lobzang Tenpa of Ganden Shartsey Monastery, who at the time wasresiding at Kopan Monastery in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Later one of my rootgurus, Ven. Doboom Tulku, kindly made time in his busy schedule to fly up fromDelhi to Kathmandu in order to help me check my translation, and we were able tocomplete two-thirds of the work, up to the end of the section introducing thegeneral principles of the illusory body and clear light doctrines. A few weekslater I had the good fortune of meeting up with another dear lama friend, Ven.Ngawang Pendey of Drepung Loseling Monastery, and he consented to help me checkover the remaining third of the manuscript.In addition, with Ngawang Pendey I read through several other treatises on theSix Yogas system, including the shorter of the two texts on \"Naro's Six Dharmas\"found in Tsongkhapa the Great's \"Collected Works\" (Tib. gSung 'bum); this is hisMikrim (Tib. dMigs rim), or \"Stages of Meditation,\" which I plan to include in aforthcoming collection of readings on the Six Yogas of Naropa. With NgawangPendey I also read through several short commentaries on Tsongkhapa's A Book ofThree Inspirations, including those by Gyalwa Wensapa (b. 1505), NgulchuDharmabhadra (b. 1772), and Jey Sherab Gyatso (b. 1803); I have drawnextensively from these in the introduction and notes. Later I re-checked severalsections of these various works with Geshey Lobzang Tenzin, also of DrepungLoseling. Finally, some months later when I was back in Canada I had the honorof meeting up with another very dear lama friend, Zasep Tulku Rinpochey of SeraJey Monastery, and at his Ganden Choling Meditation Center in Toronto checkedthrough a number of passages regarding which I still had points of doubt,including the Epilogue and the section dealing with the physical exercises,which is written in a rather cryptic form.The actual work of translation began quite auspiciously in Lhasa, where I wasleading a group from the Tampa Art Museum, Florida, on pilgrimage to the holyplaces of Tibet. The bulk of the writing took place in my home-away-from-home,Room 405 of the Snow Lion Guest House, Chettrapati, Kathmandu, with its windowlooking up at the holy Swayambu Stupa. For me, setting is important to the taskof setting pen to paper. Although the Kathmandu Valley has become somewhatchaotic and polluted over the past decade due to the tremendous influx ofmountain villagers, the aura of sacredness emanating from its many holy Buddhistsites still shines with great strength. Preparation of the final manuscript wasdone at the country cottage of a New York friend, Ms. Lulu Hamlin, who over theyears has greatly encouraged and supported my Dharma activities. Prof. AlexWayman of Columbia University kindly offered guidance on technical matters, andJimmy Apple of the University of Wisconsin generously helped in tracing down themany scriptural quotations that ornament Tsongkhapa's treatise. Over the yearthat the writing took place a number of other friends also helped with variousdetails of the work; in this regard I would especially like to thank ConradRichter, Michael Robillard, Pierre Robillard, Atisha Mullin, Hilary Shearman,Heidi Strong, Tina Teno, Athena Tara, and Debby Spencer. Finally, the staff atSnow Lion-Sidney Piburn, Susan Kyser and Jeff Cox-offered much valuable adviceand support.Fifteen years ago in a conversation with a very dear spiritual friend, Lama ZopaRinpochey of Kopan Monastery, Nepal, the topic of translating tantric scripturesfor open publication came up. I replied that I was somewhat hesitant to workwith tantric material because of the self-professed secret nature of thetradition. Rinpochey laughed and replied, \"When we came out of Tibet we allthought of the words of tantra as secret. But actually they are reallyself-secret. You should translate and publish tantric texts. It could benefitpeople. Those without a connection won't buy the book; or even if they do, theywon't be able to understand the meaning.\"I remember once when I was living in Dharamsala a friend's father came to visit.He picked up a book from the table, opened it at random, and began to read italoud. The chapter was on the topic of the logic of emptiness. After a page orso he looked up, a somewhat stunned expression on his face, and said, \"You know,there was not a single word on that page that I didn't know. But I don't have aclue what the thing as a whole is talking about.\"On the other hand, when one approaches self-secret literature in its ownenvironment, allowing it to speak in its own words and to use its own metaphorsand illustrations, a sense of the profound integrity of the language soon beginsto dawn.Throughout the text the names of the Tibetan masters who are quoted or referredto are spelled simply as they sound in English, i.e., Jey Sherab Gyatso ratherthan rJe shes rab rgya mtsho. For the specialist, these are given in theirtransliterated forms in the glossary. In the main body of the text I do not usediacritical marks on Sanskrit names and terms, as these are distracting to thegeneral reader; but again they can be found in the glossary.As is standard practice with classical Tibetan authors, Tsongkhapa quotes allIndian texts from their translated versions preserved in the Tibetan canons, andgives the titles only in abbreviated Tibetan forms. Hence he will refer to theShri samputa tantra raja tika amnaya manjari simply as Manngak Nyema (Tib. Manngag snye ma), which in Sanskrit would become Amnaya manjari. Similarly, Tibetantextual titles appear only in condensed forms. I have followed a policy ofgiving all titles in English translation wherever this seems practical, followedat their first occurrence by the abbreviated Sanskrit or Tibetan forms inparentheses. Again, here diacritics are not put on the Sanskrit, but all textsare listed in the bibliography with fuller forms of both the Sanskrit andTibetan titles of the Indian works.I have done my best to insure that the translation is error-free; butTsongkhapa's text is profound, and no doubt some hazy readings have found theirway into the fabric of my work. Here I can only echo the sentiment expressed byTsongkhapa in a closing verse of A Book of Three Inspirations, in which headdresses the subject of his concern with any errors that he himself may havebrought into his composition:The essence of the profound teachings is hard to perceive And ordinary beingscannot easily penetrate them. Hence I request the dakas and dakinis To bepatient with any faults of my treatise.As Tsongkhapa states again and again in A Book of Three Inspirations, anunderstanding of the context of the Six Yogas, and thus an appreciation of itsprofundity, is greatly facilitated by an understanding of the Guhyasamaja Tantrasystem known as the Five Stages (Skt. Pancha krama). Unfortunately none ofTsongkhapa's quintessential Guhyasamaja material has yet been translated. Thisis the next big step in the transmission of the Gelukpa tantric system.The tradition of \"Naro's Six Dharmas\" has fascinated and delighted CentralAsians for almost a thousand years now. As Tibetan Buddhist studies continue tomature in the West, it will undoubtedly also receive considerable attentionhere. If this work can make a small contribution to the understanding of thisextraordinary legacy, my purpose in undertaking the project will have beenfulfilled.Glenn H. MullinSnow Lion Guest HouseChetrapatti, Kathmandu, NepalMarch 14,1995"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONTSONGKHAPA AND THE LINEAGE OF THE SIX YOGASTsongkhapa the Great stands as a colossal figure in Tibetan spiritual history.One of the most creative of the many illustrious writers, philosophers andscholar-yogis to grace the Land of Snows, he is usually referred to intraditional literature simply as Tsongkhapa Chenpo, \"Tsongkhapa the Great,\" oras Gyalwa Nyipa, \"the Second Buddha.\" His Collected Works reveal the depth andscope of his endeavors, which encompass the entire range of Buddhist thought,both in the Sutrayana, or public teachings, and the Mantrayana, or esoterictantric doctrines.His appearance on the Tibetan scene was timely. Less than two centuries hadpassed since the Turkic invasions of India had destroyed Buddhism in the land ofits birth. Yet long before the destruction was complete, Tibet had absorbed muchof what had existed in Buddhist India. The threads of the diverse lineages werescattered across the vast Central Asian plateau, to be found in mountainhermitages, monasteries, cave retreats and other sites of spiritual activity.The spread of Buddhism in Tibet is usually divided into two periods: the Earlyand the Later Disseminations of the Doctrine. The first of these refers to thetransmissions that occurred prior to the end of the tenth century C.E.; thesecond refers to the renaissance of the eleventh century, and the plethora ofschools and sub-schools that this spawned. The Six Yogas of Naropa belongs tothe period of the Later Dissemination of the Doctrine.Tibetan records of the influx of Buddhist teachings do not provide us with muchdetail on the period prior to the seventh century. However, in approximately 650C.E., under the rule of King Songtsen Gampo, Buddhism became the country'snational religion. From this time on, the importation of Buddhist lineages wassystematically executed under royal patronage, and clear records were kept. Allthe major sutras, tantras and shastras' were translated from Sanskrit intoTibetan at that time, and the principal Indian Buddhist systems of practice wereestablished as living traditions in the Land of Snows. Tibetans remember this asthe golden era of the Three Great Dharma Kings.' Even though the civil wars ofthe early ninth century destroyed much of what had been accomplished,nonetheless many translations survived, as well as dictionaries of technicalterms, and before long many of the lineages were revived. The schools of TibetanBuddhism deriving from transmissions of this period are known as the Nyingmapa;or \"Old Schools.\" This term is synonymous with the phrase \"the EarlyDissemination of the Doctrine.\"In the eleventh century increasing numbers of Tibetans once more began to travelsouth over the Himalayas to study with Indian masters. Many of them joined thetraining programs at the large international monastic universities of northernIndia, such as Nalanda and Vikramashila. Others studied with individual masters,as was the case in Marpa's training under Naropa. A movement to re-translatelarge sections of the vast corpus of Buddhist Sanskrit literature began, using arevised terminology based on Tibet's centuries-old Buddhist experience and onthe nature of Buddhism in India at that time. The scholar-yogis returning toTibet found themselves eagerly sought after as teachers; clusters of studentsgrew up around them, and these developed into monasteries and hermitagesdedicated to the study and practice of the specific lineages imported by thefounding translator.Because this Later Dissemination of the Doctrine was largely a freelanceundertaking, in contrast to the Early Dissemination, which had generous courtfunding, the results were predictably individualistic. Several dozen new schoolsof Tibetan Buddhism were born at this time, the similarity between them beingestablished by the fact that the language they used in their translations wassomewhat standard, having followed the movement emanating from western Tibet.Thus prior to Tsongkhapa's time most schools of Tibetan Buddhism were primarilybased upon specific transmissions coming directly from India. The school thatwas to emanate from his work, known as the Gelukpa, or \"Order of Excellence,\"was the only successful Tibetan Buddhist school to be formulated solely from afusion of indigenous Tibetan lineages. Similar movements gradually becameabsorbed into the other schools, and thus ceased to exist as independententities.It didn't take Tsongkhapa long to discover that some lineages of transmissionwere more powerful than others, and that some had remained more true to theletter and spirit of Indian Buddhism. Even with the transmissions of the earlymasters whom he greatly admired, his impression was that, with the passage ofthe generations, many of the Tibetan lineage lamas had become somewhatprovincial, and suffered from poor training, sloppy understanding, and spiritualcomplacency.He made it his life's work to trace down the clearest of the many lineages oftransmission coming from India, his measuring stick always having three edges toit: the original sutras and tantras spoken by the Buddha; the treatises (Skt.shastras) of the Indian masters; and the works of the early Tibetan translatorswho imported the individual traditions.One of the early translators in whom he placed great faith was Marpa Lotsawa4(b. 1012), the forefather of the Kargyupa school (Tib. bKa' brgyud ring lugs;lit. \"Order of Instructions\"). Prominent among the lineages that Marpa importedwas that famed as \"Naro's Six Dharmas,\" i.e., the Six Yogas of Naropa.Tsongkhapa's treatise on this system of tantric practice is formally entitled ABook of Three Inspirations: A Treatise on the Stages of Training in the ProfoundPath of Naro's Six Dharmas (hereafter simply referred to as A Book of ThreeInspirations). It became the standard guide to the Naropa tradition at GandenMonastery, the seat he founded near Lhasa in 1409. Ganden was to become themotherhouse of the Gelukpa school, and thus the symbolic head of the network ofthousands of Gelukpa monasteries that sprang up over the succeeding centuriesacross Central Asia, from Siberia to northern India. A Book of ThreeInspirations has served as the fundamental guide to Naropa's Six Yogas for thetens of thousands of Gelukpa monks, nuns and lay practitioners throughout thatvast area who were interested in pursuing the Naropa tradition as a personaltantric study. It has performed that function for almost six centuries now.Tsongkhapa's Collected Works contains two texts on the Six Yogas: A Book ofThree Inspirations, which was actually composed by him, and is sixty folios or120 pages in length; and an abbreviation and recasting of this work, compiledand edited by one of his disciples, Sempa Chenpo Kunzangpa, which focuses on theactual meditations, leaving out the discussions of the principles involved. Thelatter is twenty folios or forty pages in length, a third the size ofTsongkhapa's original.In the Fire Monkey Year (1836) Jey Sherab Gyatso, a monk-scholar who attained toprominence in the mid-nineteenth century, delivered a public reading of LamaTsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations. A disciple transcribed some of JeySherab Gyatso's words, and after the master's death these were published in hiscollected works under the title Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations (Tib. Yidches gsum Idan gyi bshad lung zin bris). The opening passages of his text revealsomething of the history of the tradition of Naropa's Six Yogas, and theattitude toward it in the Gelukpa school:Marpa of Lodrak received numerous transmissions directly from the illustrious(Indian) pandit Naropa. Among these were six instructions drawn from the varioustantric traditions. He gathered these six into the structure that has becomefamed as \"Naro's Six Dharmas.\" Each of these six contains a comprehensivepresentation of the completion stage yogas; and the six as presented hereprovide a comprehensive approach to the completion stage yogas.Naropa imparted the Six Yogas to Marpa, together with the Song of the Six Yogas.However, even though all six of these certainly existed in India prior toNaropa, whether or not they had at that time been arranged into that structureis a point of doubt.Naropa's Six Yogas was the unique instruction of the early Kargyupa lamas. LamaTsongkhapa the Great received this tradition and later composed his treatise onthe system, A Book of Three Inspirations. Thus the Six Yogas came into theGandenpa [i.e., Gelukpa] order.The Kargyupas are especially renowned for their tradition of the Six Yogas, andtheir early lineage masters, such as Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, Pakmo Drupa andDrikungpa, were flawless elucidators of the tradition. However, as the lineagepassed from generation to generation a large number of subtle points ofconfusion and error found their way into many of the oral transmissions. JeyGyalwa Nyipa [the \"Second Buddha,\" i.e., Tsongkhapa] removed these, andclarified all the key points and basic principles of the system. For this reasonthe lineage of Naropa's Six Yogas as practiced within the Gelukpa order today isespecially powerful.The names given in the above passage identify the lineage of transmission of\"Naro's Six Dharmas\": Naropa himself (b. 1016), who was the Indian Buddhistmaster to train Marpa Lotsawa of Tibet in the doctrines and practices of the SixYogas; Marpa Lotsawa (b. 1012), who brought the lineage to Tibet and taught itto hundreds of disciples there; Milarepa (b. 1040), one of Tibet's greatestpoets, and also one of Marpa's four greatest disciples; Gampopa (b. 1079), theDoctor of Dakpo, a Kadampa monk who became a disciple of Milarepa and eventuallyemerged as the latter's most successful Dharma heir; glorious Pakmo Drupa (b.1110), who was to inspire the vast popularity that Naropa's Six Yogas achievedin the twelfth century; and Drikungpa Jigten Sumgon (b. 1143), the mostillustrious of Pakmo Drupa's eight chief disciples.Thus here we have the names of Naropa and the first five generations of Tibetanlineage masters descending from him, beginning with Marpa Lotsawa. The schoolsoriginating in these lamas, known as the Kargyupa, were the early vehicle ofNaropa's Six Yogas in Tibet.Marpa had four chief disciples, all of whom received a number of uniquelineages. Three of these-Ngokton, Tsurton and Milarepa- received thetransmission of Naropa's Six Yogas. The fourth- Meytson-received Marpa'sGuhyasamaja lineages. Tsongkhapa quotes or refers to all four extensivelythroughout his treatise, yet it was Milarepa's lineage of Naropa's Six Yogasthat was to be received by Lama Tsongkhapa some three centuries later.Milarepa in turn produced dozens of accomplished disciples in the traditions ofthe Six Yogas. The most charismatic of these was the Kadampa monk Gampopa, whosehermitage in Dakpo became a hive of activity, with yogis and yoginis immersingthemselves in training under him. Four of these became predominant, and fromthese there came four separate Kargyupa sub-sects, known as the \"four olderKargyupa schools\" (Tib. bKa' brgyud ring lugs the bzhi). The glorious PakmoDrupa, mentioned in the quotation above, was one of these four. He in turnproduced eight most excellent disciples, from each of whom was born yet anotherseparate Kargyupa sub-sect, known as the \"eight younger Kargyupa schools\" (Tib.bKa' brgyud ring lugs chung brgyad).5 Thus there came to be twelve distinctKargyupa sects, each holding individual transmissions of the Six Yogas. Thesegenerally had a central monastery or hermitage, and dozens of affiliated ones.Tsongkhapa summarizes the list of the early Kargyupa lamas as follows in A Bookof Three Inspirations:Marpa transmitted his lineage [of the Six Yogas of Naropa] to three of hisdisciples: Ngokton, Tsurton and Milarepa. In turn, Milarepa transmitted hislineages to two main disciples: Chojey Gampopa and Rechungpa. The lineagedescending from Gampopa multiplied into many different forms, each with its ownspecialty, uniqueness and individual views on the different practices....Thus within a hundred years of arriving in Tibet the tradition of \"Naro's SixDharmas\" had established a firm foothold in the Land of Snows.In the quotation above, Jey Sherab Gyatso begins by mentioning these earlyTibetan masters. He then jumps more than two centuries, and introduces theauthor of our text, Tsongkhapa the Great, and the role that he was to play inthe transmission. The nineteenth-century Jey Sherab Gyatso is, of course, a monkof the Gelukpa school descending from Lama Tsongkhapa. This is obvious from thewords with which he concludes his line of thought, \"For this reason the lineageof Naropa's Six Yogas as practiced within the Gelukpa order today is especiallypowerful.\" What he means is that Lama Tsongkhapa applied the strength of hisgenius to the Six Yogas tradition, thus empowering the Gelukpa transmission withthe unique depth and lucidity that he brought into everything he touched,presenting each point within the context of the overall structure of Buddhistdoctrine. Even a casual reading of his text reveals the richness of his style,as he compares the diverse ideas floating around the Tibetan spiritual world atthe time.However, with Tsongkhapa the Great we are already into the late fourteenth andearly fifteenth centuries. Perhaps it would be useful to jump back in time tothe roots of tantric Buddhism in Tibet, which lie in the Buddhist tantrictradition of ancient India."},{"pageContent":"THE BUDDHIST TANTRIC TRADITION IN INDIAThe Buddhist legacy of eleventh-century northern India, the period in whichNaropa and Marpa lived, was a blending of the Sutrayana, or open, exotericteachings of the Buddha (lit. \"the Way of the Public Discourses\"), and theMantrayana, or \"Way of Secret Mantra,\" which refers to the esoteric teachings ofthe tantric traditions. The Sutrayana in turn is usually spoken of as having twofacets: the Hinayana, or \"Streamlined Way Teachings,\" also sometimes called theShravakayana, or \"Teachings Recorded by the Monk Disciples\"; and the Mahayana,or \"Great Way,\" whose teachings were mostly given to saint-status disciples(i.e., bodhisattvas). This latter is also referred to in traditional Buddhistliterature as the Bodhisattvayana, or \"Way of the Universalist Warriors,\" and asthe Paramitayana, or \"Way of the Perfections.\" In traditional literature theMantrayana is also referred to by several other names, the two most common beingthe Vajrayana, or \"Diamond Way,\" and Tantrayana, or \"Way of the Tantras.\" Wewill see several references to these terms throughout Lama Tsongkhapa'scommentary as he discusses the various yogic techniques, meditations andphilosophical attitudes embodied in the legacy of the Six Yogas of Naropa.Even though it is said that the tantras were taught by the Buddha 2,500 yearsago, it seems that historically they began to emerge publicly in India in aboutthe fourth or fifth centuries C.E. According to tantric tradition, prior to thisthey had been transmitted in secret from generation to generation.Each tantra had a scripture that represented the quintessence of its teaching(usually known as its mulatantra, or \"root tantra\"). It also had a mandala ofdeities that symbolized it as a philosophy of being, a path to enlightenment,and the resultant state of buddhahood (Tib. gzhi lam 'bras bu, or \"basis, pathand fruit\"). As a path, each tantric system contained an infrastructure ofmeditational techniques and yogic methods to be engaged by tantric trainees intheir sadhana, or daily practice routine.Hundreds of different Buddhist tantric systems had surfaced in India by theninth century. The Indian masters later categorized these into four basic types,known as kriya, charya, yoga and maha-anuttarayoga, or \"purification,\" \"action,\"\"yoga,\" and \"great highest yoga\" tantras. Every tantric system became associatedwith one or another of these four. The six doctrines that comprise Naropa's SixYogas are all drawn from the fourth category, the maha-anuttara-yoga tantras.--- - - - -- - -- - - - - -Although there are considerable differences between the individual tantricsystems, they are similar in that they all arrange their vast array of practicesinto what is known in Tibetan as rimpa nyigyi naljor (Tib. rim pa gnyis kyi rnal'byor), or \"two stages of yogic application.\" In the first three types oftantric systems these two are known as \"the yoga of symbols\" and \"the yogabeyond symbols.\" In maha-anuttarayoga tantra, they are called the \"generationstage yogas\" and the \"completion stage yogas.\" In this fourth category oftantras, the first stage of practice mainly consists of visualizing oneself andall others as mandala deities, cultivating an awareness of the world as amandala, generating the tantric pride, reciting the appropriate mantras, and soforth. The second stage of practice consists of physical yogas and meditationson subtle physiology, such as those taught in the Six Yogas of Naropa anddiscussed in depth in Tsongkhapa's A Book of Three Inspirations.The maha-anuttara-yoga tantras, or highest yoga tantra systems that flourishedin north and northwest India during Naropa's lifetime, are those from whichNaropa's Six Yogas are drawn: Guhyasamaja, Heruka Chakrasamvara, Hevajra,Yamantaka, Mahamaya, Shri Chaturpitha, and so forth.In the early days of tantric Buddhism in India most tantras probably werepracticed as individual, self-contained units. Each represented a completesadhana, or path to enlightenment, and was adopted as such by tantricpractitioners. By the ninth and tenth centuries, however, the tradition ofpracticing the various tantric lineages as separate-systems had begun to fade.The new trend was in what the Tibetans call men ngak (Tib. man ngag), or \"oraltradition instructions.\" At first these were systems of practice that wereformulated from quintessential elements within a given tantra; that is to say,they were simplifications of a more complex tantric system. But before long analternative trend began to emerge, one in which elements from different tantricsystems were being combined for maximum efficacy. The men ngak of this natureusually drew into one package many diverse yogic and philosophical ideasprevalent in the tantric world of Buddhist India during the time of theirformulation. They are usually known by the name of either their formulator orpromulgator, and are based on the state of enlightenment that he or she achievedby means of them. Examples would be \"the Six Yogas\" of the female mysticSukhasiddhi; the longevity and healing yogas of the female tantric saintSiddharani; and, of course, the famous Six Yogas of Naropa, the subject of ABook of Three Inspirations."},{"pageContent":"NAROPANaropa was one of the preeminent Indian Buddhist masters of his time. He isparticularly important in the history of Tibetan Buddhism, for his lineagesbecame widespread throughout Tibet within a century of his demise. He played adominant role in the dissemination of numerous tantras, most notably theKalachakra,b Guhyasamaja, Hevajra and Chakrasamvara traditions, as well as inthe promulgation of the fusion approach to the highest yoga tantras, exemplifiedby the Six Yogas transmission.Naropa's biography has been related in several Western sources. The mostauthoritative and enchanting treatment is H. V. Guenther's The Life andTeachings of Naropa (Oxford University Press, 1963).' Prof. Guenther, one of thefirst Westerners to translate Tibetan into English with any degree ofseriousness, here delivers a wonderful rendition of a fifteenth-century Tibetanaccount of Naropa's life, with a magically fabulous telling of Naropa'sadventures during his twelve-year training under Tilopa.eIn Tibetan literature Naropa is usually referred to as a \"drupchen\" (Tib. grubchen; Skt. mahasiddha), a \"great adept.\" Here the Sanskrit maha means great, andsiddha indicates *a person who has attained siddhi, or tantric accomplishment.These siddhis, or tantric accomplishments, are of two types: common, such asclairvoyance, being able to walk through walls, etc.; and exclusive, referringto the attainment of supreme enlightenment.The mahasiddhas are always depicted as very eccentric, non-conventionalcharacters, and generally are described as possessing great spiritual powers andmagical abilities. Tibetan religious histories list the names of hundreds ofIndian mahasiddhas who emerged during India's Vajrayana period. Eighty-four ofthem are special favorites of the Tibetans, and are often depicted in watercolorpaintings as a set. Naropa is included among them. Tsongkhapa quotes both theoriginal tantras and the treatises by the mahasiddhas extensively throughout histext.Every Tibetan knows many stories from the life of Naropa by heart. Like Buddha,he had been born of an aristocratic family, but from childhood longed for thespiritual life. Like Buddha, he was forced into an arranged marriage; and, likeBuddha, he later renounced it, together with his worldly position, to become amonk. Like Buddha, he endured great trials and hardships in the course of histraining. And, like Buddha, he achieved perfect enlightenment.Born in Bengal to a Buddhist family, in the early part of his life Naropastudied with numerous celebrated teachers, firstly in Bengal and then inKashmir, where he was sent for his higher education. He achieved considerablerenown for his efforts, eventually even becoming the abbot of Nalanda, India'smost prestigious monastic university. He retained the abbotship for some eightyears, achieving widespread fame as one of India's foremost Buddhist scholars.However, during his fortieth year he experienced an encounter that radicallyaffected the course of his life. At the time he was sitting quietly, reading ascripture. Suddenly he noticed an ugly old woman observing him. She inquired,\"Do you understand the words of what you are reading?\" Naropa replied in theaffirmative. The old hag laughed and added, \"And do you understand the essence?\"Again Naropa replied in the affirmative, whereupon the old woman burst out intears. \"Here you are lying,\" she scolded.Over the days and weeks to follow, the impact of the conversation played havocon Naropa's mind, and eventually he came to the conclusion that he would have toleave Nalanda in search of a guru. Thus, shortly thereafter he resigned his seatin the monastery and left in search of a tantric master. After much wanderingand many great trials, he encountered Tilopa.Naropa's search for and then training under Tilopa is told in wildly mysticallanguage, at once both allegorical and magical. He meets a leper woman andpasses hastily by her; she sings him a verse on how, without compassion as one'smotive and wisdom one's perspective, one can never find the guru.Among his other encounters during his search were a man catching and eatinglice, a man disemboweling a corpse, and so on. Each offers him a new clue on thespiritual attitude to be cultivated in order to become worthy to meet with thetantric guru.Eventually Tilopa manifests to him, and an intense twelve-year training follows.Tibetans love to tell and re-tell how, under Tilopa, Naropa dedicated himself tothe training; how Tilopa pushed him to the limits of human endurance, and yet hepersisted; and how eventually he achieved full enlightenment and became amahasiddha.In the later part of his life Naropa attracted many disciples from India, Nepal,Tibet and the other Buddhist regions to the north of the sub-continent. However,historically speaking his most successful transmissions were those that he gaveto Marpa Lotsawa, for these came to grow and multiply, eventually penetratingthe structure of almost all Central Asian Buddhist sects.The lineages brought to Tibet by Marpa Lotsawa and transmitted by the earlyKargyupa lamas became a major pillar in the spiritual mansion being constructedby Tsongkhapa the Great. He especially cherished the Naropa transmissions, asindicated by the tone of A Book of Three Inspirations. The text was to establisha prominent place for \"Naro's Six Dharmas\" within the rapidly blossoming Gelukpaschool."},{"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF THE SIX YOGASGenerally it is said that the formulator of the Six Yogas of Naropa in fact wasnot Naropa himself, as the name would suggest, but rather his guru Tilopa (b.988). Yet, as Jey Sherab Gyatso (b. 1803) states in the pasasge quoted above,\"even though all six of these certainly existed in India prior to Naropa,whether or not they had at that time been arranged into that structure is apoint of doubt.\" Although Tilopa and Naropa had brought together numerouselements from diverse tantric sources, and Naropa had transmitted these to MarpaLotsawa, it is a point of doubt precisely who had given the system the sixfoldstructure by which it became known in Tibet.Moreover, Tsongkhapa suggests in his discussion of the elements comprising thesix individual yogas that even though \"Naro's Six Dharmas\" represent the essenceof the transmissions given by Naropa to Marpa, it is probable that Marpa alsodrew from at least four of his numerous Nepalese and Indian gurus-Chiterpa, whowas Nepalese, and Naropa, Jnanagarbha and Maitripa, who were Indians-informulating the structure and presentation of the transmission to become famedas \"Naro's Six Dharmas.\" Naropa was Marpa's main guru, but the other threeplayed major roles in his spiritual training.Tsongkhapa also points out that there are various ways of counting andstructuring the six. In settling upon the arrangement that he prefers, he refersto the writings of glorious Pakmo Drupa (b. 1110), one of the early lineagemasters, wherein the structure is as follows: (1) inner heat; (2) illusory body;(3) clear light; (4) consciousness transference; (5) forceful projection; and(6) the bardo yoga.The tradition of speaking of this legacy from Marpa Lotsawa as being sixfoldseems to have evolved somewhat randomly. As Tsongkhapa puts it,\"There are manyways of structuring this system of tantric yogas, the most common being intotwo, three, four, six and ten branches.\" In other words, the system could justas easily have ended up being popularly known as \"Naro's Two Dharmas,\" \"Naro'sFour Dharmas,\" \"Naro's Ten Dharmas,\" and so forth, without omitting any actualsubstance from the transmissionThe twofold manner of structuring the Six Yogas of Naropa is given in a treatiseby Gyalwa Wensapa (b. 1505), a Gelukpa yogi who spent over twenty yearsmeditating in caves and hermitages, achieving enlightenment in one lifetime. Hewas also an early lineage holder of the Six Yogas transmission, and his nameappears in the Seventh Dalai Lama's lineage prayer (translated below). His text,entitled A Source of Every Realization: The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa(Tib. Na ro chos drug gi lag rjes dngos grub kun 'byung), speaks of (1) theyogas for drawing the vital energies into the central channel; and (2) the yogasthat are performed once the energies have been withdrawn in this way. Here theinner heat yoga represents the first of these, and the remaining five yogas aresubsumed under the second outline.The Six Yogas are spoken of as three when they are arranged as follows: (1) thefoundation, which is comprised of the inner heat yoga; (2) the main body of thepractice, which includes the illusory body and clear light yogas; and (3) theauxiliary trainings, which include the yogas of consciousness transference andforceful projection. Here the bardo yoga is subsumed under the illusory bodyyoga. This is mentioned by Tsongkhapa.Marpa Lotsawa seems mainly to have spoken of them as fourfold: (1) inner heat;(2) karmamudra, or sex yogas; (3) illusory body; and (4) clear light. Here threeof the six-i.e., those of consciousness transference, forceful projection andthe bardo yogas-are not given the status of separate \"Dharmas,\" presumablybecause they are relegated to the position of auxiliary practices.Tsongkhapa quotes the yogi Milarepa as using a somewhat different sixfoldclassification:The tradition of Marpa of the Southern Hills has six instructions: (1) thegeneration stage yogas; (2) inner heat; (3) karmamudra yogas; (4) introductionto the essence of the view of the ultimate nature of being; (5) the indicativeclear light of the path; and (6) the indicative illusory nature, together withdream yoga. This is the heart-essence of Marpa's teachings. There is no higherprecept for introducing the trainee to the essence of the whispered teachings.There is no more precious instruction than this, the heart of that yogi'sthought. No teaching is more practical.Although Tsongkhapa mentions a tenfold structure for the system, he does notlist the ten. This arrangement may be found, however, in a commentary by NgulchuDharmabhadra entitled An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations (Tib. Na rochos drug gi zin bris yid ches dgongs rgyan). Ngulchu states,Then there is a tenfold manner of structuring the system: (1) the generationstage yogas; (2) the view of emptiness; (3) the inner heat; (4) karmamudrayogas; (5) the illusory body; (6) the clear light; (7) dream yoga; (8) the bardoyogas; (9) consciousness transference; and (10) forceful projection.If we compare this list of ten to the six as given by Pakmo Drupa andTsongkhapa, we will see that all ten have been incorporated within the six.Ngulchu also lists the manner in which Pakmo Drupa presents the Six Yogas, whichis the structure followed by Tsongkhapa in A Book of Three Inspirations, andthen gives an alternative formulation. This is an interesting variation, andNgulchu introduces it in order to show how Tsongkhapa chose the title of histext. As he puts it,Tsongkhapa also spoke of another sixfold structure: (1) inner heat and (2)karmamudra yogas, which are derived from the Hevajra Tantra; (3) illusory bodyand (4) clear light, which are derived from the Guhyasamaja Tantra; and,finally, (5) consciousness transference and (6) forceful projection, whichemanate from the Shri Chaturpitha Tantra.... Because these three sets of two arederived from such authoritative sources, Tsongkhapa entitles his text A Book ofThree Inspirations.These three Indian tantric systems are referred to repeatedly throughoutTsongkhapa's text, for they are essential sources of the Six Yogas. Note thathere the bardo doctrine is not mentioned separately, as it is included under theillusory body yoga; in its place, karmamudra yoga is elevated to the status ofone of the six yogas.As Ngulchu Dharmabhadra states above, and as Tsongkhapa points out several timesin his treatise, Naropa's Six Yogas were comprised of elements drawn from theprincipal tantras popular in northern India at the time. This is stated asfollows in the concluding verses of A Book of Three Inspirations,The incomparable Buddha Shakyamuni, lord of sages, Taught the holy Dharma forthe benefit of living beings. Supreme of his teachings are those of highest yogatantra, Both the female tantras and the male tantras.From the female tantras [i.e., Hevajra and Chakrasamvara] Comes the teaching onthe inner heat doctrine, chandali, A method for bringing the subtle energiesunder control And arousing the innate wisdom.With this as the basis one takes up the practice Of the illusory body and clearlight doctrines That emanate from the Guhyasamaja Tantra, And the doctrines ofconsciousness transference And forceful projection to another residence Thatemanate from the Shri Chaturpitha Tantra.Based on those sources there arose This tradition from the mahasiddhas Tilopaand Naropa Famed as \"the Six Yogas of Naropa.\" Countless practitioners here inthis land of snows Have delighted in this festival of profound tantric endeavor,A deeply cherished and precious oral tradition legacy.In another section of his treatise Lama Tsongkhapa speaks of the various sourcesof the Six Yogas. For example, he suggests that Marpa Lotsawa drew some of thematerial in the doctrines of the illusory body and clear light from another ofhis Indian gurus, Jnanagarbha, with whom Marpa had studied the GuhyasamajaTantra. Guhyasamaja is the source from which Naropa's Six Yogas take theillusory body and clear light doctrines. Tsongkhapa states,The instruction on the inner heat yoga comes to us through Tilopa, who commentedthat this was the transmission of the mahasiddha Krishnacharya, also known [toTibetans] as Lobpon Acharyapa. Here these previously existent oral traditionsare used as the basis. This is enriched and clarified in reference to TheSambhuta Drop of Springtime (Skt. Samputa tilaka) and also AcharyaKrishnacharya's The Drop of Springtime (Skt. Vasanta tilaka).The illusory body and the clear light doctrines are derived from the Guhyasamajaoral tradition, as taught by the Indian mahasiddha Jnanagarbha and received [byMarpa directly from him]. Thus these are based on the Guhyasamaja Tantra. Herethe Marpa tradition of the Guhyasamaja oral instruction transmission has beenused as the basis, with references to the Guhyasamaja cycle of the Aryas, Fatherand Sons [i.e., \"The Arya Cycle of Guhyasamaja Doctrines\"].The practices of consciousness transference and forceful projection to a newresidence are based on the Four Seats Tantra (Skt. Shri chaturpitha tantra). Inaddition,... they are associated with numerous other tantric traditions,including the Sambhuta Tantra, the Vajradaka Tantra, and so forth.The legacy of the Six Yogas thus appears to have roots in diverse IndianBuddhist tantric sources.Another lineage of the Six Yogas known as the Six Yogas of Niguma wastransmitted to Tibet through Niguma, a female disciple of Naropa who alsoreceived from him a transmission of the Six Yogas. This alternative lineage wasnot brought to Tibet by Marpa Lotsawa, but rather by one of his contemporaries,a lama by the name of Kyungpo Naljor.9 The main difference between the twotransmissions seems to be that the Niguma system replaces the yoga of forcefulprojection with dream yoga.Jey Sherab Gyatso (b. 1803) makes a statement to this effect in his Notes on ABook of Three Inspirations (Tib. Yid ches gsum ldan gyi bshad lung zin bris),Originally the dream yogas were not emphasized in the system of the Six Yogas ofNaropa; and the yoga of forceful projection did not exist in the system of theSix Yogas of Niguma. It seems that this difference is the reason for maintainingthese two as separate systems. Otherwise, the two are very similar.In Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations Jey Sherab Gyatso also points out thatEach of these six [yogas] contains a comprehensive presentation of thecompletion stage yogas; and the six as presented here provide a comprehensiveapproach to the completion stage yogas.The implication is that the system can be taken as an integrated and holisticapproach to the completion stage yogas, in which case all six practiced togetheras a unit represent the essence of all completion stage practices;alternatively, any one of the six can be taken as the principal focus of one'spractice, in which case all completion stage yogas are approached from and drawninto it. These days the former tradition is more common, although thebiographies of yogis of bygone centuries suggest that this was not always thecase.Gyalwa Wensapa sums up the situation as follows in A Source of EveryRealization: The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa (Tib. Na ro chos drug gi lagrjes dngos grub kun 'byung),Thus the jewel-like practitioner who engages in the profound path of Naropa'sSix Yogas has entered into a complete and unmistaken path for accomplishingenlightenment in one short lifetime, even in this degenerate age."},{"pageContent":"THE SIX YOGAS, THREE BARDO STATES, AND NINEBLENDINGSLama Tsongkhapa states in the opening section of A Book of Three InspirationsthatIt is recorded that when Venerable Milarepa taught the oral instructiontransmission for achieving liberation in the bardo he said, \"First establish thebasics....\" The above expression, \"the oral instruction transmission forachieving liberation in the bardo,\" is synonymous [with the Six Yogas ofNaropa].In other words, in the time of Milarepa (b. 1040) the Six Yogas of Naropa werealso known by the name \"the Bardo Trang-dol system\" (Tib. bar do 'phrang sgrol),which translates as \"the Oral Transmission for Achieving Liberation in theBardo.\"Most readers will be familiar with the Tibetan term \"bardo,\" which literallymeans \"the in-between,\" and its reference to the after-death state. Severaltranslations of the Bardo To-dol (Tib. Bar do thos sgrol), or \"Liberation byHearing in the Bardo,\" have appeared in English under the title The Tibetan Bookof the Dead, resulting in \"bardo\" being the first (and perhaps only) Tibetanword to find its way into the Oxford and Webster's dictionaries.A unique feature of the Six Yogas tradition is that it speaks of three bardostates, and of the methods of practicing tantric meditation in each of them. Thethree are: the bardo of the waking state between birth and death; the bardo ofsleep and dreams; and the bardo between death and rebirth. Only the third of thethree usages of the term bardo carries the sense that it has in The Tibetan Bookof the Dead.The Six Yogas tradition speaks of how the tantric technology is to be applied ineach of these three bardo states. This process is known as \"the yoga of thethree blendings in the three situations.\" In other words, the three blendingsare to be engaged in each of the three bardo states, and thus there are nine\"blendings.\" Because by means of the Six Yogas one can practice in all threebardo states-waking, sleeping/dreaming, and after death-the tradition was called\"the Oral Transmission for Achieving Liberation in the Bardo.\"To understand what is being referred to by the \"nine blendings,\" we must have abasic knowledge of the Mahayana Buddhist concept of the three kayas: Dharmakaya,Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya.The doctrine of the three kayas is fundamental to all highest yoga tantrasystems. Volumes have been written on the subject in the Tibetan language. Theidea is that at the time of enlightenment the mind of the practitionertransforms into the Dharmakaya, speech transforms into the Sambhogakaya, and thebody manifests as the Nirmanakaya. The Dharmakaya can only be perceived by otherbuddhas; the Sambhogakaya can be perceived by aryas, or highly realized beings;and the Nirmanakaya can be perceived by ordinary beings. Therefore it is saidthat the Dharmakaya fulfills one's own wishes and needs, whereas theSambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya fulfill the wishes and needs of the world.Sometimes the Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya are grouped together as the Rupakaya,or \"Form Body,\" in which case only two kayas are mentioned: Dharmakaya, whichfulfills one's own purposes; and Rupakaya, which fulfills the purposes ofothers.In exoteric Mahayana practice the emphasis is on cultivating the mind, thespeech or communicative principle, and the body, until they eventually grow intothese three kayas. In tantric Buddhism, something from the enlightenment stateof the three kayas is brought into and blended with our ordinary situation. Forthis reason the exoteric Mahayana is sometimes called \"the causal vehicle,\"i.e., the path in which one meditates upon the causes of enlightenment and thusgrows into it; and the esoteric tantric path \"the resultant vehicle,\" because init one brings something from the resultant state of enlightenment into ordinaryexperience. In other words, the idea behind the \"three blendings\" is that oncertain occasions we can take an element from within the body-mind complex andits stream of experience, and use this as a proxy (Tib. rjes mthun) of one ofthe three kayas, or enlightenment dimensions, supplementing the natural force ofthis proxy with the forces of meditation and yogic application.The concept of blending with the three kayas is first introduced during thegeneration stage practice, in which one meditates upon oneself as a tantricdeity dwelling at the center of the supporting mandala. Here one engages in theprocess known as \"taking the three kayas as the path\" (Tib. sku gsum lam'khyer), which refers to three steps in meditation: (1) the visualization thatthe world and its inhabitants dissolve into one's body, and then the coarseenergies withdraw from within one's body, just as at the time of death, untilthe clear light mind arises, which is known as \"taking death as the Dharmakaya\";(2) the visualization that one arises from the clear light in a pure energyform, which is the practice of taking the bardo experience as the Sambhogakaya;and (3) the visualization that one arises as the Mandala Lord, which is theprocess of taking rebirth as the Nirmanakaya. This generation stage meditationis performed daily by all serious initiates, and in the Six Yogas system setsthe stage for the completion stage trainings of the \"three blendings.\"As Tsongkhapa explains, in the completion stage yogas this principle is extendedto three different environments: blending with the three kayas during the wakingstate; blending with the three kayas during sleep; and blending with the threekayas at the time of death. In other words, the three blendings are performed ineach of the three bardo states. The underlying concept here is that the lifeprocess itself is a metaphor for the three kayas, and we can utilize thisparallel in our yogic application during each of the three bardo states.It may be useful to look at some of the ways in which the Six Yogas arepresented by the different Tibetan commentators in order to appreciate what isbeing said here.Tsongkhapa states in A Book of Three Inspirations that the Six Yogas actuallycould be presented as three: (1) the foundation of the path, which is the innerheat yoga; (2) the main body of the path, which includes both the illusory bodyand clear light doctrines; and (3) the auxiliary trainings, which are comprisedof the consciousness transference and forceful projection doctrines. When wecompare this to how Gyalwa Wensapa condenses the Six Yogas, based on theirfunction, into two, we can see something of what the \"blendings\" are about. Thetwo are: (1) those yogas for drawing the vital energies into the centralchannel; and (2) those that are applied after the energies have been drawn intothe central channel. Here Tsongkhapa's first category, the inner heat yoga, isalso Gyalwa Wensapa's first. Tsongkhapa's remaining two, and Wensapa's second,contain the remaining five yogas of the Six Yogas system.Why, in the context of the \"three blendings,\" is the inner heat yoga called \"thefoundation state,\" and the illusory body and clear light yogas called \"theactual path\"? Because by means of the inner heat yoga one gains control over thecoarse and subtle energies of the body; these energies are withdrawn, causingthe according inner and outer signs to manifest, together with the relatedvisions, until the clear light of mind arises just as at the time of death. Inother words, it is by means of the inner heat yoga that the clear lightconsciousness can be invoked in the continuum of one's conscious experience.This is blended with a proxy of the Dharmakaya. The illusory body technology isthen applied in order to blend with the Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya. Thus theinner heat is the foundation of the three blendings, but the clear light andillusory body yogas are the actual method of engaging the blendings.One of the most wonderfully succinct presentations of this process of the threeblendings is that found in the treatise by Gyalwa Wensapa, A Source of EveryRealization: The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa:The technology for drawing the vital energies into the central channel beginswith generating the image of oneself as Buddha Vajradhara, male and female insexual union, and envisioning the energy channels, together with the mantricsyllables at the chakras, meditating on the heat, and finally meditating on themelting drops. This causes the vital energies to enter, abide and dissolve.The sign indicating the entering of the vital energies is that, when a breath isinhaled in order to test one's progress, the air flows evenly through bothnostrils. The sign indicating that they have been caused to abide is that thevisions of the elemental dissolutions and also the dissolution of the threevisionary states occur. These dissolutions must be individually recognized.Earth dissolves into water, and there is a vision like seeing a mirage; waterdissolves into fire, and there is a smoke-like vision; fire dissolves into air,and there is a vision like flickering fireflies. Then the air element begins todissolve into the visionary consciousness called \"appearance.\" There is a visionlike that of the glow of a butterlamp. Air fully dissolves into \"appearance,\"and there is a vision of whiteness, like a clear autumn sky pervaded by thelight of the full moon. This dissolves into the consciousness known as\"proximity,\" and there is a vision of redness, like that of the clear skypervaded by sunlight. This dissolves into \"proximate attainment,\" and there is avision of overwhelming darkness, like the sky before dawn, with neither sun normoon. \"Proximate attainment\" then dissolves into the clear light; there is avision of clear radiance, like the sky at daybreak, free from the threeconditions. One must recognize these experiences as they occur. This is theprocess known as \"blending with Dharmakaya during the waking state.\"When the time comes to arise from the clear light absorption one arouses thestrong instinct to put aside one's old aggregates and arise in the form of aBuddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Then when one arises from the clearlight one's old aggregates will be set aside and within the mind there forms theimage of a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Simultaneously oneapplies the technology for inducing the stages of dissolution [described above]in reverse order. Thus one goes from the clear light to proximate attainment, toproximity, and to appearance. One experiences the signs of the elementaldissolutions [in reverse]: a glow like that of a butterlamp; firefly-likesparks; smoke; and finally the mirage. This is the process known as \"blendingwith the Sambhogakaya during the waking state.\"One engages in the stages of meditation on transformations associated with thatSambhogakaya form, and focuses one's absorption upon it. When one decides toarise from the absorption, one does so by meditating upon one's old aggregatesas the Symbolic Being [Skt. samayasattva], with the Wisdom Being [Skt.jnanasattva] at the heart. This is the process known as \"blending withNirmanakaya during the waking state.\"Simultaneous to this, as the air begins to flow through the nostrils again andthe five sensory consciousnesses are revived, whatever appearances occur areseen as emptiness, emptiness as ecstasy, and ecstasy as the mandala and itsdeities. This is the practice to be cultivated in the post-meditation sessions.Gyalwa Wensapa then explains the process of blending with the three kayas duringthe sleep and dream states,Similarly, when that yogi goes to sleep he attempts to retain the clear light ofsleep, and sets the resolution to arise as a Sambhogakaya deity in the dreamstate. As he prepares for sleep he engages in the meditations on the channels,energies and chakras, causing the drops to melt and the blisses to arise. Thevital energies enter, abide and dissolve within the central channel. All thesigns of the dissolution process occur, from \"earth into water,\" until theemergence of the clear light. The four emptinesses emerge in the nature of thefour blisses. At the same time as the clear light occurs, the yogi engages inmeditation on ecstasy conjoined with [the wisdom of] emptiness. This is theprocess known as \"blending with Dharmakaya in sleep.\"When the time comes to arise from that clear light one generates the resolutionto arise with a dream body by setting aside the body of the old aggregates andtaking the form of a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Then when oneemerges from the clear light [of sleep] the dream body appears, not as the bodyof the old aggregates, but rather as a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female inunion. This is what is known as \"blending with Sambhogakaya in dreams.\"One focuses one's absorption on the meditations of the transformative processesof that Sambhogakaya. When the time comes to awaken from sleep, one does so byemerging with one's old aggregates envisioned as the Symbolic Being, and withthe Wisdom Being at one's heart. This is the process known as \"blending withNirmanakaya while awakening.\"Simultaneous to this, as the air begins to flow through the nostrils and thefive sensory consciousnesses revive, whatever appearances occur are seen asemptiness, emptiness as ecstasy, and ecstasy as the mandala deities. This is thepractice to be cultivated in the post-meditation sessions.Thirdly Gyalwa Wensapa speaks of how the three blendings are engaged at the timeof death and in the bardo,The yogi who is not able to accomplish the realizations of the highest stagebefore the time of death should cultivate the resolution to apply the technologyfor retaining the clear light of death, arising in the Sambhogakaya in thebardo, and taking birth with the incarnation of a tantric master, amantracharyin. Then as the actual moment of death draws near one should meditateon the channels, energies, chakras and so forth as above, and meditate upon theblazing and melting. This causes the vital energies to enter into the centralchannel, and to abide and dissolve, giving rise to the signs of thedissolutions, until the signs of the clear light occur. As the clear light ofdeath emerges one focuses in meditation upon emptiness. This is the processknown as \"blending with Dharmakaya at death.\"When the time comes to arise from the clear light one arouses the instinct toset aside the old aggregates and, in taking a bardo body, to arise in the formof a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union. Then as one emerges from theclear light the image of the bardo body arises, with the old aggregates setaside, and appearing as Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union.Simultaneously the signs of the dissolution process manifest in reverse, asconsciousness reverses through the stages of clear light to proximateattainment, and so forth, until the vision of the mirage. This is the processknown as \"blending with Sambhogakaya in the bardo.\"One remains focused on the stages of absorption in the meditations of theSambhogakaya transformations. Then when the wish to take rebirth begins tocrystallize, one seeks a suitable genetic environment in the white and red drops[i.e., the fertilized egg] of one's future parents, in order to achieve rebirthas the special bodyvessel of a mantracharyin. This is the process known as\"blending with Nirmanakaya at rebirth.\"Thus the ability to control the subtle energies and bring them into the centralchannel is indispensable to success in the process of the three blendings in thethree situations. This control is established by the inner heat yoga, thefoundation. As Tsongkhapa puts it, the inner heat located in the navel chakra isto be ignited, the energies brought into the central channel, and the subtlegenetic drops flowing within the channels and chakras melted. These \"melteddrops,\" which support the subtle energies of the body-mind complex, are thencollected inside the heart chakra, where they are assembled as the basis of thesubtle body. The energies from all other parts of the body are withdrawn intothis unprecedented \"house of the subtle mind,\" from which the clear light mindis to be consciously experienced for the first time.Throughout A Book of Three Inspirations we see a constant repetition of thetopic of the dissolution process, wherein the energies are withdrawn from eachof the coarse elements. This begins with the earth energies dissolving intothose of water; an inner vision is experienced, like that of a mirage. The waterenergies dissolve into fire, and the vision of smoke occurs. These stages of theenergy dissolutions continue, until all the coarse energies have been withdrawn.The subtle drops then come to the heart chakra. Firstly the red female dropscollect, giving rise to a red vision and the mindset called \"appearance.\"Secondly the white male drops collect; there is the inner vision of a whitelight, and one experiences the mindset known as \"proximity.\" Thirdly the whiteand red drops collapse together; there is an inner vision of utter blackness,the mindset of \"proximate attainment,\" and one swoons into unconsciousness. Fromthis one arises in the fourth mindset, that of the primordial clear light. Thesefour are-also called the \"four emptinesses.\"The idea in highest yoga tantra is that we naturally experience thesedissolutions in the three bardo states-our daily waking life, the sleep state,and the time of death. The \"dissolution process,\" which is partially experiencedevery time we go to sleep, and is inescapably and utterly experienced at thetime of death, can be consciously induced during the waking stage by means oftantric yoga. When we become skilled in inducing the dissolutions in our dailymeditations, we become fluent in applying the same techniques during sleep anddreams, as well as at the time of death.In Tsongkhapa's threefold breakdown of the system, the ability to consciouslywork with this dissolution process, and thus the ability to consciously inducethe tantric blisses at will, is established by means of the inner heat yoga,which therefore is termed \"the foundation stone.\" The main practice, theillusory body and clear light yogas, involves using the dissolution processfirstly to manifest the illusory body, and then to immerse this illusory body inthe clear light. One applies the technology of the dissolutions for producingthe \"unpurified\" and \"purified\" illusory bodies, and realizing the \"semblant\"and \"actual\" clear light consciousnesses. This brings about enlightenment, whichin the tantric tradition is known as yuganaddha, or \"the great union.\" Theauxiliary practices, i.e., the remaining three yogas, are merely aids inimplementing the first three.In A Source of Every Realization: The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa, GyalwaWensapa explains the manner in which the practitioner is transported across thestages in training, until enlightenment is won:First one meditates on the phases of the dissolution process, which causes thevital energies to enter into the central channel, abide and dissolve. This givesrise to the signs of the dissolutions, from the mirage up to the clear light.When the time comes to emerge from the clear light, one arouses the resolutionto have the unpurified illusory body transform into a purified illusory body.Then as one arises from the clear light the unpurified illusory body is setaside, and the image of the purified illusory body arises within the mind.Simultaneous to that, one experiences the dissolution process in reverse; onemoves from the clear light to proximate attainment, and so forth, until the signof the mirage. The being engaging that Sambhogakaya form then arises asNirmanakaya, emanating forth the supported and supporting mandalas. When hewants to arise from meditation he does so by envisioning his old aggregates asthe Symbolic Being, with the Wisdom Being at his heart....The practitioner of this illusory body stage cultivates these advancedmeditations, and eventually sees signs that the accomplishment of the stageknown as \"the great union of training\" is approaching. He engages in thepractice of uniting with a karmamudra as the external condition; and as theinner condition engages the meditations on the stages of the dissolutions and soforth, causing the vital energies to enter the central channel, abide anddissolve. The signs of the dissolutions occur, from that of the mirage to thatof the clear light. The four emptinesses emerge in the nature of the fourblisses. At the moment of the innate clear light, one engages the meditation ofecstasy conjoined with emptiness.At that time five factors occur simultaneously: the state known as \"proximateattainment in the unfoldment process\" ceases; the innate ecstasy induces anunprecedented direct realization of emptiness; the illusory body is purified inthe actual clear light and appears like a rainbow in a radiant sky; one achievesthe unhindered stage wherein the direct antidote to the emotional obscurationsis born within one's mindstream; and one's continuum becomes that of an arya.By the time the process of emerging from the clear light begins, one's previousdriving force in the practice will have come into play, placing one at the doorthrough which the \"purified illusory body\" can be achieved. As one emerges fromthe clear light, with the role of the substantial cause being played by thesubtle energy of five radiances, upon which rides the innate actuality [i.e.,the innate actual clear light consciousness], and the role of the simultaneouslypresent condition being played by the mind itself, one arises in the actual\"purified illusory body,\" which flows in an unbroken stream in a form such asthat of Buddha Vajradhara, male and female in union, adorned by the marks andsigns of perfection, one's old aggregates set aside.Simultaneously the signs of the dissolution process in reverse manifest, fromthat of going from the clear light to proximate attainment, until the sign ofthe mirage. At that time five factors occur: the innate actuality [i.e., actualclear light mind] ceases; the state of proximate attainment in the dissolutionprocess is produced; the arisal of the \"purified illusory body\"; one achievesthe path of utter liberation which is free from emotional obscurations; andone's continuum becomes that of an arhat. The being of that Sambhogakaya formthen focuses in meditative absorption.What are the stages of that absorption? One focuses in singlepointed meditationupon emptiness, and then causes the vital energies to enter into the centralchannel, to abide and to dissolve, giving rise to the signs, until the clearlight occurs. At that time one has arrived at the place wherein can beunobstructedly achieved the state of great union, wherein body and mind can beassembled as a single entity. Here body is represented by the perfect illusorybody adorned with the marks and signs of perfection; mind is represented by theactual clear light consciousness.When the time comes to arise from that clear light one's previous driving forcefrom the practice comes into play, and one finds oneself at the door throughwhich the body of great union in training can become that of the great unionbeyond training. In emerging from the clear light, the being on the stage of\"the great union of training\" perceives the image of the body of the stage of\"the great union beyond training.\" Simultaneously the signs of the reversalprocess occur, from that of moving from the clear light to proximate attainment,and so forth, until the mirage.That Sambhogakaya holds the potential of the Nirmanakaya, which emanates forth anet of activities, such as manifesting the supported and supporting mandalas.When one wishes to arise from meditation, one enters into one's own oldaggregates or some other old aggregates, whichever is appropriate. Then,residing in that vessel, one shows Dharma to those to be trained, and cultivatesthe after-practice activities, such as uniting with a karmamudra, eating anddrinking, as well as running with wild animals, and so forth....The yogi on the stage of great union of training cultivates the absorptions ofthat level during both formal meditation and post-meditation sessions, andeventually sees signs of the approach of the attainment of great union beyondtraining. He engages the external condition of uniting with a karmamudra, andthe internal condition of meditating single-pointedly on emptiness, causing thevital energies to enter into the central channel, and to abide and dissolve. Thesigns, beginning with the mirage and so forth, occur, until eventually the signsof the clear light manifest. The four emptinesses arise in the nature of thefour blisses.The moment this innate clear light manifests, one engages the meditation ofecstasy conjoined with [the wisdom of] emptiness. The first moment of this clearlight is the unobstructed stage on which the perceptual obscurations aretranscended. The second moment of it is also the first moment of omniscientbuddhahood, wherein one remains in perfect absorption upon the final nature ofbeing, while at the same time directly seeing all conventional realities asclearly as a piece of fruit held in the hand. The body of great union oftraining becomes the great union beyond training, the actual Sambhogakayaendowed with the kisses of the seven excellences, and that sends out thousandsof Nirmanakaya emanations to benefit those to be trained. Thus one achievescomplete buddhahood in the nature of the three kayas.Thus we can see that the language of the \"elemental dissolutions,\" \"threeblendings,\" and \"three kayas\" continues throughout the various levels ofapplication of the Six Yogas of Naropa, which culminate in omniscientenlightenment, the state known as \"the great union beyond training.\"One of the most popular practice manuals on the Six Yogas system used by Gelukpalamas today is A Source of Great Ecstasy Realization: A Guide to the ProfoundSix Yogas of Naropa (Tib. Zab lam na ro,'i chos drug gi khrid yig bde then dngosgrub 'byung nas), by Nagtsang Tulku (mid-nineteenth century). Nagtsang dividesthe stages of practice into two: (1) meditating on the inner heat yoga in orderto give rise to the four blisses; and (2) on the basis of that realization, themeditations on \"the (nine) blendings.\" In other words, the practitioner is firstinstructed on how to apply the inner heat yoga in order to gain experience ofthe four blisses; these four are experienced by means of invoking thedissolution of the elemental energies, bringing the vital energies into thecentral channel, and melting the subtle drops. When this realization has beenmade firm, he or she is instructed in the technology of the \"nine blendings\"described above.In summary, Gyalwa Wensapa's A Source of Every Realization: The Stamp of the SixYogas of Naropa also looks at the process of the Six Yogas in reverse, i.e.,from the stage of final enlightenment, or \"great union beyond training,\" to thefirst step on the path:As a preliminary to attaining the stage of the great union beyond training, onemust go through the stage of great union of training. As a preliminary to thatone must accomplish the illusory body and clear light yogas, and to succeed inthat one must first meditate upon the channels, chakras, blazing, melting, andso forth, as taught in the inner heat yoga.In turn, as a preliminary [to these completion stage practices] one must go tothe end of the coarse and subtle generation stage practices in which onevisualizes birth, death, and bardo, the bases to be purified, as the paths ofthe three kayas. For this one must have received the complete empowerments, andbe mature in observing the disciplines adopted at the time of initiation.Moreover, before entering into tantric practice one should train the mind in thecommon path, from cultivating an effective working relationship with a spiritualmaster, up to the meditative training that combines shamata and vipasyana.Thus the jewel-like practitioner who engages in the profound path of Naropa'sSix Yogas in this way has entered into a complete and unmistaken path foraccomplishing enlightenment in one short lifetime, even in this degenerate age."},{"pageContent":"LAMA TSONGKHAPA'S A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONSThe tradition of the Six Yogas became a major subject of Tibetan commentarialwriting-treatises on the subject no doubt number well into the thousands. Overthe centuries nearly every monastery produced one or more literary treatments ofthe system, perhaps mainly in order to provide a guide to how the Six Yogascould be integrated into the spiritual doctrines and linguistic infrastructurethat formed the basis of its individual traditions. There were well over fivethousand monasteries in the Tibetan ethnographic area prior to the greatdestructions wrought by the Communists earlier in this century. Many of thesecommentaries were lost in this destruction, but several hundred have survivedand come down to us today.Tsongkhapa the Great's A Book of Three Inspirations has for centuries beenregarded as special among the many. The text occupies a unique place in Tibetantantric literature, for it in turn came to serve as the basis of hundreds oflater treatments. His observations on various dimensions and implications of theSix Yogas became a launching pad for hundreds of later yogic writers, opening upnew horizons on the practice and philosophy of the system. In particular, hiswork is treasured for its panoramic view of the Six Yogas, discussing each ofthe topics in relation to the bigger picture of tantric Buddhism, tracing eachof the yogic practices to its source in an original tantra spoken by the Buddha,and presenting each within the context of the whole.His treatise is especially revered for the manner in which it discusses thefirst of the Six Yogas, that of the \"inner heat.\" As His Holiness the presentDalai Lama put it at a public reading of and discourse upon the text inDharamsala, India, in 1991, \"the work is regarded by Tibetans as tummo gyigyalpo, the king of treatments on the inner heat yoga.\" Few other Tibetantreatises match it in this respect.Tsongkhapa wrote his commentary to the Six Yogas at the request of none otherthan the Pakmo Drupa ruler Miwang Drakpa Gyaltsen and his younger brother SonamGyaltsen. At this period of Tibetan history, prior to the appearance of theDalai Lamas, Tibet was under Pakmo Drupa administration and the royal family wasformally linked to that sect of the Kargyupa school. They were great patrons ofTsongkhapa, sponsoring his construction of Ganden Monastery near Lhasa, and alsohis institution of the Monlam Chenmo, or Great Prayer Festival of Lhasa, whichwas to become an annual national event. The circumstances of his writing aregiven in the colophon:This treatise on the profound path of the Six Yogas of Naropa, entitled A Bookof Three Inspirations, was written at the repeated requests of the lordly MiwangDrakpa Gyaltsen and Chojey Sonam Gyaltsen, who asked for a work that wouldclarify the key points in the inner heat yogas, as well as briefly touch uponthe common and exclusive distinctions in the trainings.Tsongkhapa was in a unique position to write authoritatively on the subject. Asa young monk student he had studied in forty-five different monasteriesrepresenting over a dozen sects, and thus had received exposure to an array oftraditions of the Six Yogas as maintained in the various hermitages. Inparticular, he had received extensive guidance in the traditions preserved inthe Pakmo Drupa (Kargyu), Drikung (Kargyu) and Zhalu schools. In addition, hehad received numerous other lineages descending from Marpa Lotsawa, who hadbrought the Six Yogas to Tibet, and thus was able to bring his knowledge ofthese into his presentation.Throughout his treatise Tsongkhapa quotes freely from earlier masters, and mostof these quotations are derived from the Tibetan translations of early Indianworks, either an original tantra or an authoritative Indian treatise. Thisquality pervades the pages of the hundred or so principal books that he penned.When he does quote a Tibetan lama, it is usually one of the early lineagemasters belonging to the period in which the tradition moved from India toTibet. 10There are a number of ways of explaining the title of Tsongkhapa's treatise, ABook of Three Inspirations. One of these is given in Notes on A Book of ThreeInspirations by Jey Sherab Gyatso, who quotes the following verse from theclosing section of Tsongkhapa's text in which Tsongkhapa is commenting upon thebasic focus that he adopted in his composition:It contains clear instructions on the stages of meditation in this path, A clearand critical guide to the principles in the trainings, And references to theauthoritative tantras and commentaries; These are the three features withinwhich it is set.Jey Sherab Gyatso then states, \"These are probably the three inspirationsreferred to in the title.\" In other words, because the treatise has these threefeatures, it can be regarded as an object of confidence and inspiration. Thesame was said by the Dalai Lama's late Junior Tutor, Kyabjey Trijang Rinpochey,in his 1973 public reading of Tsongkhapa's text in Dharamsala.A second explanation of the title of the text is given by Ngulchu Dharmabhadrain An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations and was quoted above. Ngulchulinks Tsongkhapa's threefold division of Naropa's Six Yogas into \"foundation,actual body and auxiliary practices\" to the Indian sources from which the sixare drawn. He mentions this three times in different contexts in his commentary.His reading is based on the words with which Tsongkhapa presents his sources inhis Epilogue. The idea is that the substance of the first of the three, \"innerheat, the foundation...,\" is sourced in Krishnacharya's transmissions known asThe Drop of Springtime and The Sambhuta Drop of Springtime, both of which werereceived by Tilopa and represent the essence of the Hevajra Tantra and theHeruka Chakrasamvara Tantra teachings on chandali, or inner heat. The second ofthe three, i.e., the main body of the path, or the illusory body and clear lightdoctrines, represent the essence of the Guhyasamaja Tantra as expressed in theNagarjuna tradition known as the \"Arya Cycle\" and embodied in Nagarjuna's Panchakrama, or Five Stages. Finally, Marpa Lotsawa had spent three years in Nepal onhis first journey to India, during which he mastered the Four Seats Tantra, orShri Chaturpitha Tantra, the source of the third of the above three categories,i.e., \"the auxiliary trainings\" of consciousness transference and forcefulprojection. Ngulchu states, \"Because each of the three branches of the Six Yogasis based on such authoritative sources, Tsongkhapa entitles his treatise on thetradition A Book of Three Inspirations.\""},{"pageContent":"SECTION ONE OF TSONGKHAPA'S TEXTNaropa's Six Yogas belong to the category of tantric doctrine known as highestyoga tantra, and within that category they belong to the second stage ofpractice, which is also known as the completion stage. Thus their instructionsare addressed to those who have completed the basic trainings and, as theclassical expression goes, \"accomplished the preliminaries.\"Tsongkhapa opens his treatise, A Book of Three Inspirations, by dividing hispresentation into two main sections: the first dealing with the preliminariesand prerequisites of entering into practice of Naropa's Six Yogas, together witha presentation of the general principles of the generation and completion stagescenarios; and the second dealing with the actual Six Yogas themselves.THE PRELIMINARY TRAININGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GENERAL MAHAYANATsongkhapa classifies the preliminary trainings that are necessary in order toprepare one's mind for the practice of the Six Yogas as being twofold: the\"common\" preliminaries, and the \"exclusive\" ones. He then goes on to point outthat the former of these refers to the general philosophical and contemplativetraditions derived from the Sutrayana, or \"public discourse\" teachings of theBuddha. These are the general Mahayana techniques of basic observationmeditation, working with karmic law, the contemplations on love and compassion,the altruistic aspiration, and so forth. Tsongkhapa does not give much space tothese in his commentary, for, as he puts it, he has \"written extensively onthese elsewhere.\" Presumably by this he is referring to his Lam Rim Chenmo, orGreat Exposition of the Stages on the Path.In closing this section, Tsongkhapa drops us a gem of advice from the melodiousvoice of the poet and yogi Milarepa,If one does not contemplate the nature of karmic lawHow good and negative deedsproduce according resultsThe subtle power of the ripening nature of activity Maybring a rebirth of unbearable suffering. Cultivate mindfulness of action and itsresult.If one does not observe the faults of sensual indulgence And from within oneselfreverse grasping at it, One will not become freed from the prison of samsara.Cultivate the mind that sees all as an illusion And apply an antidote to thesource of suffering.If one is unable to show kindness to every living being Of the six realms, whoonce was one's own kind parent, One falls into the limitations of a narrow way.Therefore cultivate the universal bodhimind That looks on all beings with greatconcern and caring.Jey Sherab Gyatso in Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations comments thatTsongkhapa at this point in his treatise first invokes the name of AtishaDipamkara Shrijnana, the Indian master who came to Tibet in 1042 at royalinvitation and from whose work the Kadampa school (Tib. bKa' gdams ring lugs)emerged, and then invokes the name of Milarepa, an early lineage master in theSix Yogas transmission, in order to demonstrate that the attitudes of these twoeleventh-century masters were in harmony on the need for using the generalMahayana trainings as a basis for and preliminary to tantric training.Jey Sherab Gyatso goes on to point out that Atisha's Lamp for the Path toEnlightenment (Skt. Bodhipathapradipa) categorizes all the general Mahayanapractices into three branches: initial, which involves contemplating karmic law,impermanence and so forth, in order to turn the mind away from grasping at theephemeral things of this life and toward higher spiritual aspirations;intermediate, which involves contemplating the shortcomings of indulgence andhigher worldly accomplishments, and invoking the aspiration to achieve nirvana;and vast, which involves contemplating love, compassion, universalresponsibility, and the bodhisattva resolve, and giving rise to the aspirationtoward omniscient Buddhahood. He then states that the three verses of Milarepaquoted by Tsongkhapa respectively embody these three steps in training."},{"pageContent":"THE GENERAL TANTRIC PRELIMINARIESTsongkhapa now turns to the \"exclusive\" preliminaries. Here he says, \"These areof two types: the general Vajrayana preliminaries; and-the. preliminariesemphasized in-this- Naropa system.\"The first of these reminds the reader that there are certain guidelines commonto all Vajrayana, or tantric systems. Anyone wishing to practice the Six Yogasof Naropa, a tantric system, would therefore have to fulfill these.Essentially there are two guidelines common to all tantric systems. The first isthat the trainee must receive the tantric initiations appropriate to the systemto be undertaken; second, he or she must become firmly established in thetantric samaya, or \"sacred oaths.\"The receiving of initiation from a living lineage master is regarded as anindispensable prerequisite. Tsongkhapa quotes an Indian classic, The Mark of theGreat Seal (Skt. Mahamudra tilika),When should trainees be given instruction? Only after they have received theempowerments; For at that time they become appropriate vessels To receive thetantric teachings. Without empowerment there will be no attainment, Just as oildoes not come from pressing sand.The emphasis in tantric Buddhism on transmission as living tradition is thusmade plain. Tsongkhapa relates the story of the first meeting between Milarepaand his disciple Gampopa. Milarepa was the direct disciple of Marpa, who in turnhad received the Six Yogas directly from Naropa; and Gampopa was destined tobecome Milarepa's greatest disciple, as well as the forefather of all twelveKargyu schools. Tsongkhapa writes,When Venerable Milarepa first met his disciple Chojey Gampopa, the former askedthe latter, \"Have you received the tantric initiations?\" Gampopa replied, \"Ihave received them from Maryul Loden, a disciple of Zangkar.\" Milarepa thereforeaccepted to teach him.Maryul Loden had received the Chakrasamvara initiations brought to Tibet byZangkar Lotsawa, a translator of Western Tibet whose name is derived from thearea of his birth, i.e., Zanskar (near presentday Ladakh). Gampopa had thusreceived the appropriate empowerments, and consequently Milarepa could give theSix Yogas transmission to him without any other preparation being required.Tsongkhapa concludes the section by saying, \"It is best if here the empowermentis into a mandala from either the Hevajra or Chakrasamvara cycles. These twohave a special connection [with the Naropa Six Yogas system].\" Although theselineages were brought to Tibet by Marpa, along with the lineage of the SixYogas, they also existed in the Land of Snows prior to Marpa's time, forexample, in the lineage of Maryul Loden mentioned above.Tsongkhapa's point is that although the Six Yogas are a synthesis of elementsfrom diverse tantric sources, their foundation is the first of them, thedoctrine of the inner heat yoga. In turn, the inner heat doctrine is drawn fromtwo sources, namely, the Hevajra and Chakrasamvara tantric cycles. Because theinner heat doctrine is identical in the two systems, initiation into eithersystem is valid as a basis for practicing the Six Yogas. Tsongkhapa thenproceeds to discuss the various lines of transmission that he considers to bethe most authoritative.Concerning the Vajrayana preliminary of cultivating stability in the tantricsamaya, Tsongkhapa does not elucidate the particular disciplines that areexpected of a tantric initiate. These may be found, however, in NgulchuDharmabhadra's commentary, An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations:The tantric samaya are of three types: those concerned with eating; thoseconcerning what is to be maintained; and those concerning what is to be owned.The first of these categories refers to eating the five meats and five nectars,and to first consecrating whatever one consumes. The second refers to thegeneral samaya of the Five Tathagatas, the fourteen root and eight secondaryprecepts, and the nineteen individual guidelines. One should understand thesefour categories, as well as what constitutes a small or intermediate breach ofthem, and make the effort to maintain them.... As for the third category, whichconcerns what is to be owned, this refers to keeping a vajra and bell, the handdrum, a special mantra rosary, the bone ornaments, and so forth. One should ownthe actual tantric implements and objects, or else a drawing of them....Whenever failings occur, one should respond as though a poison had beenaccidentally eaten and quickly apply an antidote, such as the mantra recitationsand meditations of Vajrasattva or Samayavajra, the Vajradaka fire rite, and soforth.As the Thirteenth Dalai Lama points out in \"A Guide to the Buddhist Tantras,\"\"the list of fourteen root tantric vows was created by the Indian master AcharyaAshvaghosha (ca. fifth century C.E.) by drawing from a large number of earlytantric treatises, and the list of eight secondary tantric precepts was compiledby Nagarjuna in his later life (ca. sixth century). Thus the tradition of \"rootand secondary tantric precepts\" does not originate directly from the tantrastaught by the Buddha, but rather is an innovation of the Indian mastersAshvaghosha and Nagarjuna.His Holiness the present Dalai Lama comments in Cultivating a Daily Meditation12that there really are only two tantric precepts: (1) always to cultivate thevision of \"radiant appearance,\" i.e., of the world as a mandala and oneself asthe mandala deity; and (2) always to maintain the sense of tantric pride, i.e.,the thought that oneself and all others constantly rest in enlightenment.Tsongkhapa concludes his discussion of the topic of the disciplines by quoting atantra from the Chakrasamvara cycle. He writes, \"Also, The Tantra ofInterpenetrating Union (Skt. Shri samayoga tantra) states,Not to have been introduced into the mandala, To ignore the tantric precepts...To practice on that basis produces no attainment.\""},{"pageContent":"THE TANTRIC PRELIMINARIES UNIQUE TO THE SIX YOGAS SYSTEMThe preliminaries that are exclusive to the Six Yogas legacy are comprised oftwo principal practices: the meditation and mantra recitation of Vajrasattva;and the practice of guru yoga, which includes the mandala offering symbolic ofthe universe. Tsongkhapa explains these two in considerable detail, pointing outthat both of these practices are also done in other tantric systems. It is themanner in which they are performed in the Six Yogas system that makes themunique. Jey Sherab Gyatso explains their importance in Notes on A Book of ThreeInspirations:The two exclusive preliminaries emphasized in the Six Yogas system are those ofVajrasattva and guru yoga. Both of these use some form of the seven-limbeddevotion. Actually, from within the range of practices for purifying the mindthat are common to both the general Mahayana and Vajrayana, that known as theseven-limbed devotional offering, together with the mandala offering, ispredominant. Furthermore, as a means of facilitating the guarding of theVajrayana disciplines and guidelines, the Vajrasattva meditation and recitationof the hundred-syllable mantra are recommended. And even though some manuals onthe tantric trainings state that the Vajrasattva practice is unnecessary forthose who keep their disciplines well, nonetheless every school and sect thatmaintains a tradition of the Six Yogas of Naropa recommends it. As well, it isused in conjunction with almost all tantric systems of completion stage yoga.What is unique in the Six Yogas system is the tradition of how the Vajrasattvaand Guru Yoga practices are done in retreat or semi-retreat as five sets of100,000. These are comprised of 100,000 refuge mantras, 100,000 physicalprostrations, 100,000 mandala offerings, 100,000 Vajrasattva mantras, and100,000 guru mantras. Other tantric systems use these same meditations, but doso as short preliminaries to each individual meditation session, or at leastonce a day, rather than as major retreat practices.The tradition of doing \"the 500,000 preliminaries\" was introduced into Tibet byMarpa Lotsawa, and soon became standard in most schools of Tibetan Buddhism.Similarly, the legacy of a \"great retreat\" of three years, three months andthree days was also designed by Marpa, and these days is maintained in mostschools.In my translation of A Book of Three Inspirations I have taken the liberty ofmoving Tsongkhapa's treatment of these two meditations- Vajrasattva and GuruYoga-from their placement in the treatise to the back of the book, where theyappear respectively as Appendices I and II. Tsongkhapa presents the twomeditations in detail, because in his time they were not especially widespreadpractices, and he wanted to make it clear that he endorsed them wholeheartedly.However, due to the culturally bound nature of their language, I felt that theywould distract the Western reader from an appreciation of the flow of ideas inTsongkhapa's work."},{"pageContent":"THE GENERATION STAGE YOGASWhen the above preliminary practices have been completed, Tsongkhapa recommendsthat the trainee engage in the generation stage trainings, which means themeditations on the mandala and its deities. He discusses the tradition of andneed for the generation stage meditations as a condition for entering into theSix Yogas, all of which are completion stage yogas. He also discusses whichtantric mandalas are best used for the generation stage practice, and providesus with guidelines on how the practice is best pursued. Tsongkhapa recommendsmeditation upon the mandalas of either Hevajra or Heruka Chakrasamvara as thebasis of the generation stage training. He then proceeds to explain how oneapproaches and pursues the practice, whichever mandala is used.Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations speaks of how thegeneration stage practice centers around the process of \"taking the threeoccasions as the path of the three kayas,\" which, as we saw earlier, introducesthe trainee to the process of the \"nine blendings.\" He also mentions somedistinctions between how the generation stage is practiced in the Gelukpa schooland how it is approached in the older schools:The principle behind the generation stage yogas is the process known as \"takingbirth, death and bardo as the path of the three kayas.\" By means of thegeneration stage yogas [the trainee] is introduced to the process oftransforming the experiences of birth, death and bardo into the three kayas ofenlightenment: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya. This prepares the mindfor the methods of the completion stage yogas, which bring about this actualtransformation.The Sakya and Kargyu schools mostly rely upon simplified mandalas that use onlya pair of central deities, male and female in union, such as Hevajra and consortNairatmya, for accomplishing this ripening process of the generation stage.However, Tsongkhapa recommends that in the beginning we should practice with acomplete mandala, and then later, when stability has been attained, reduce it tothe central male-and-female-in-union deity. This is less problematic. He doesnot recommend that we use a simplified mandala from the beginning. The importantprinciple here is that the meditation upon the supporting mandala purifiesperception of the world, and meditation upon the supported mandala deitiespurifies the practitioner's five psychophysical aggregates.This can be accomplished by meditation upon any of a number of mandalas, but themandala should be at least as complex as that of the Ghantapada lineage of theChakrasamvara mandala, which has five deities, for we want to purify the fivepsycho-physical aggregates and transform the five inner distortions into thefive wisdoms.An exception to this rule [of a mandala having a minimum of five deities], asTsongkhapa points out in several of his writings, is the mandala of SolitaryVajrabhairava [i.e., Yamantaka], wherein a single mandala deity suffices for theprocess. Many lamas from other schools question Tsongkhapa's logic on thisrecommendation of Solitary Vajrabhairava. Tsongkhapa's idea here is that theVajrabhairava system combines elements from both the male tantras and the femaletantras, and therefore is adequate.In brief, because Naropa's Six Yogas embodies elements from both the male andfemale tantras, it is acceptable to practice the generation stage yogas byutilizing the mandalas from any of the three main tantric cycles: Guhyasamaja,Heruka Chakrasamvara, or Vajrabhairava. Many of the early gurus [in the SixYogas lineage] used either Hevajra or Chakrasamvara as their personalmeditational deity, and thus accomplished the generation stage yogas inconjunction with a mandala from one of those two cycles.Jey Sherab Gyatso then states that regardless of the mandala one uses for thegeneration stage yogas, it is best if one receives an initiation into eitherHevajra or Heruka Chakrasamvara prior to engaging in the actual practice of theSix Yogas, which are completion stage trainings, and that the single mostappropriate is that of any of the four families of Hevajra. It is obvious fromTsongkhapa's tone that a number of his readers will have heard of practicing theSix Yogas without first having undergone sufficient training in the generationstage meditations. He invokes the words of great masters of the past, and alsopresents his own reasoning on the topic, in order to demonstrate why he thinkssuch an approach is unwise. He then sums up the essence of the generation stagetraining most wonderfully as follows:From the very beginning of the generation stage yogas these two aspects ofpractice-divine pride and the radiant appearance of the mandala-should becultivated as complementary. When our meditation on the supported mandaladeities and supporting mandala achieves maturity, the mere mindfulness of theradiantly present image will give rise to a wonderful sense of being, in whichthe ordinary appearances of things do not arise. Thus the technique has thepower to purify from within the mind the mundane presence of the conventionalworld. Similarly, if one can generate a strong sense of unfeigned divine prideas explained earlier, this will have the power to purify from within the mindthe habit of apprehending things as mundane.One arises from formal meditation and goes about daily activities, seeing themanifestations of world and living beings as mandala and tantric deities. Thisis the samadhi that transforms the world and its living beings into a mostextraordinary vision. This is what is meant by the expression, \"The generationstage yogas purify mundane appearance and apprehension.\"Jey Sherab Gyatso's commentary also succinctly presents the two principalelements in the generation stage yogas: radiant appearance and divine pride. Headds a note on the second of these which I have not seen elsewhere:The process of the generation stage yogas begins by concentrating on oneself asthe lord of the mandala, surrounded by the mandala entourage. If the centraldeity has many faces and hands, one first concentrates on the main face andaccomplishes clarity with it. One then concentrates on the two main hands. Afterthat one gradually supplements the visualization with other details of the maindeity, and then goes onto the consort, entourage, and supporting mandala, untilall appears with total clarity.One must cultivate two principal factors: the radiant appearance of oneself asthe mandala deity and the world as mandala; and the divine pride, the strongthought \"I am the tantric deity.\"At first this thought is contrived, but gradually it arises spontaneously. Onthe generation stage of practice the divine tantric pride of the form of thedeity is accomplished. Then during the completion stage yoga, at the phase ofpractice known as \"the vajra recitation,\" the divine tantric pride of the speechof the deity is accomplished. Finally, the divine tantric pride of the mind ofthe deity is accomplished at the stage of the clear light yogas."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE NATURE OF THE MINDAfter discussing the general Mahayana and exclusively tantric preliminaries, ourauthor then embarks upon a discussion of the general principles of thecompletion stage tantric yogas as the spiritual environment within which the SixYogas will be engaged.This begins with a discussion of \"the nature of the basis,\" which refers tointroducing the trainee to the tantric vision of the body and mind. The natureof the mind is taught first, for this awareness is of fundamental importance tothe application of the tantric yogas. Here the topic of discussion is thedoctrine of emptiness, for it is the rich dynamic of the emptiness of the mindand mental experiences, with its implications for the processes of perceptionand knowledge, that renders the spiritual process possible.Tsongkhapa's treatment of the topic of the nature of the mind opens with a versefrom Lama Marpa on how he had trained in the emptiness doctrine:I travelled east to the banks of the Ganges River And there, through thekindness of Guru Maitripa, Realized the uncreated nature of phenomena. I seizedwith my bare hands the emptiness nature of my mind, Beheld the primordialessence beyond concepts, Directly encountered the mother of the three kayas, Andsevered the net of my confusion.The trademark of Tsongkhapa's approach to the subject of emptiness, the finalnature of being, is his commitment to the Madhyamaka, or \"Middle View\" schoolsof classical India. It is significant here that he presents a reference by Marpato Maitripa, because from among Marpa's various Indian gurus, Maitripa was themaster most committed to the Madhyamaka approach.Marpa had studied with approximately fifty Indian and Nepali gurus; but thethree principal ones were Naropa, Jnanagarbha and Maitripa. From the first hereceived, among other things, the Six Yogas; from the second he received atransmission of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, which, as Tsongkhapa points outelsewhere in A Book of Three Inspirations, Marpa used to adorn the illusory bodyand clear light doctrines received from Naropa; and from the third he receivedhis training in the emptiness doctrine, by means of which he achieved hismahamudra realization, or understanding of the emptiness teaching.Tsongkhapa then quotes another direct disciple of Maitripa, the illustriousSahajavajra, who wrote a commentary to Maitripa's Ten Reflections on SimpleSuchness (Skt. Tattva dashaka). Sahajavajra states,One should rely upon the approach to emptiness elucidated by the greatMadhyamaka masters Arya Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Chandrakirti, and so forth, whoteach that the interdependent, co-existent nature of phenomena points to thesuchness of being. One should adopt the guidelines set forth by these threemasters.These are Tsongkhapa's great philosophical heroes: Nagarjuna, Aryadeva andChandrakirti. The first two are the early forefathers of the Madhyamaka movementin second- and third-century India; the third was a later elucidator of theirthought.In the centuries between Nagarjuna's early work and the advent of Chandrakirti,the Madhyamaka school had branched out into a number of different directions.Chandrakirti's famous text A Guide to the Middle View (Skt. Madhyamaka avatara)became a landmark in classical Indian Buddhist philosophy, analyzing andassessing the various philosophical trends into which the Madhyamaka schools hadevolved. The Madhyamaka lineage that emerged from Chandrakirti's clarificationof Nagarjuna's teachings became known as the Prasangika. Tsongkhapa regardsMaitripa as one of eleventh-century India's greatest spokespersons of theemptiness doctrine that had been transmitted and clarified by Nagarjuna,Aryadeva and Chandrakirti, and as one of the greatest later Indianrepresentatives of the Madhyamaka Prasangika view. Therefore Marpa's referenceto Maitripa serves Tsongkhapa's purposes well, allowing him to address thesubject of the ultimate nature of the mind with the language of the MadhyamakaPrasangika school. The salient point in Tsongkhapa's approach to the tantras isthat in regard to the view of emptiness he always keeps within Madhyamakaparameters.He summarizes the essence of the Madhyamaka message by quoting a treatise byArya Nagarjuna entitled The Sixty Stanzas on the Nature of Emptiness (Skt. Yuktishashtika),All the various objects of experience Are like the moon reflected inwaterNeither really true nor really false. Those appreciating this do not losethe view.Tsongkhapa then continues,One should understand the emptiness doctrine in the context of this simile. Thewise perceive that all things-persons and phenomena-arise in reliance upon theirown causes and conditions, and that based on this process we impute mentallabels upon things. The phenomena themselves have no true or inherent existencefrom their own side. They have no self-nature whatsoever....Although all things lack even the smallest speck of true existence, nonethelessconventionally the laws of causes and conditions operate through them, andconventionally all the phenomena in samsara and nirvana seem to exist, arisingin the same manner as do illusions, dreams and a reflected image.The discussion of the real nature of the mind concludes with some verses fromMilarepa, Marpa's great yogi disciple, to demonstrate that Milarepa had alsoupheld the Madhyamaka view of Maitripa, and consequently of Nagarjuna. Milarepasang,Eh-ma! Yet if there are no living beings, how then Could the buddhas of thethree times come into being? Without a cause, there can be no effect.From the perspective of conventional reality, All things in samsara and nirvana,Which the Buddha has accepted as conventionally valid, All existents, things,appearances, non-existents, All these functional realities, are inseparably Ofone taste with the quintessential nature of emptiness. There is noself-awareness, and no other-awareness. All share in the vastness of yuganaddha,the great union.The wise who realize this truth No longer see mind, but only wisdom-mind. Theyno longer see living beings, only buddhas. They no longer see phenomena, onlythe quintessential nature.Here again Jey Sherab Gyatso in his Notes on A Book of Three Inspirationselaborates Tsongkhapa's position:These days in Tibet there are many lamas who teach that the emptiness philosophyof the tantras is different from that of Arya Nagarjuna, and that the former ishigher. However, many different sources, including the collection of texts knownas \"Four Interwoven Treatises\" ('Grel pa bzhi sbrags), reveal how the twosystems are in harmony.Some Kargyupas even say that the mahamudra philosophy of Marpa and Milarepa ishigher than the Madhyamaka emptiness doctrine of Nagarjuna. To show that the twoare parallel, [Tsongkhapa] quotes a song by Lama Marpa.... This demonstrates howMarpa achieved his understanding of the mahamudra doctrine under Maitripa. Thismaster was definitely a follower of Chandrakirti, the great elucidator ofNagarjuna's doctrine of emptiness, as demonstrated by [Maitripa's treatise] TenReflections on Simple Emptiness. [Tsongkhapa then also quotes] Milarepa...toshow how Milarepa upheld this same view. So let's face it: If Marpa andMilarepa, the two great early Tibetan masters of the Six Yogas tradition, didnot know the special features of the mahamudra emptiness philosophy associatedwith the transmission, who does? As Tsongkhapa so elegantly suggests, to takethe mahamudra doctrine beyond what Marpa and Milarepa taught is to contradictthe very basis of this Kargyupa legacy.Jey Sherab Gyatso then explains why the subject of the real nature of the mindis discussed in relation to the emptiness philosophy of Nagarjuna, Aryadeva,Chandrakirti, Maitripa, Marpa and Milarepa. As he puts it, it is this mostsubtle dimension of the mind-the dimension which has, by means of the emptinesstraining, transcended its coarse obscurations of grasping at sensory phenomenaas real, as well as the six or twenty-six emotional and cognitivedistortionsthat has the capacity to directly experience final emptiness, theultimate nature of being. It is also this dimension of consciousness focusedupon the ultimate nature of being that is implied by the term mahamudra as usedin Gelukpa highest yoga tantra literature."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE NATURE OF THE BODYIn the technology described by the completion stage yogas, to which the SixYogas belong, the body and mind exist on three planes simultaneously. Adifferent frequency of consciousness arises from each of the three physicalbases. These three, with both body and mind, are simply called \"coarse,\"\"subtle\" and \"very subtle.\"The coarse body refers to our ordinary physical presence characterized by flesh,bones and sensory powers. This \"coarse body\" gives rise to \"coarseconsciousness,\" the state of awareness in which conventional sensory data areprocessed, together with the associated intellectual and emotional dimensions ofthe sensory experience.The \"subtle body,\" also called the \"vajra body,\" supports the \"subtleconsciousness.\" This subtle body is comprised of the network of the abidingenergy channels (Skt. nadi; Tib. rtsa), the energy centers (Skt. chakra; Tib.rtsa 'khor), the flowing subtle energies (Skt. vayu or prana; Tib. Hung), andthe emplaced sexual drops (Skt. bindu; Tib. thig le). The completion stage yogasof all highest yoga tantra systems involve working with these chakras, nadis andso forth, and therefore in all systems there is a description of how tovisualize these energy factors within the body, how to bring the energies undercontrol, and so forth. Tsongkhapa explains this process later in his text, underthe presentation of the inner heat yoga.As Tsongkhapa states in his text, the completion stage yogas of all highest yogatantra systems speak of separating the coarse levels of the body from thesubtle. In effect, the coarse are sedated by means of the tantric yogas andmeditations, allowing the subtle to dominate. This in turn allows the subtleconsciousness to manifest.One persists in the tantric yogas, and eventually the very subtle body emerges.This \"body\" is the subtle energy that arises from the mansion created byassembling the subtle drops inside the chakra at the heart. These form into asingle drop supporting the subtle physical energies, and all ordinary links withthe body are severed.When this \"body\" has been separated from the two earlier ones, one experiences\"very subtle consciousness.\" The frequency of the consciousness that arises whenonly the heart-drop is present as the support of the energies is what isreferred to as \"the most subtle mind.\"Gyalwa Wensapa summarizes the tantric theory of these three dimensions of bodyand mind very succinctly in A Source of Every Realization: The Stamp of the SixYogas of Naropa:The body is threefold: coarse, subtle, and very subtle. The \"coarse body\" is theordinary body, made of flesh, blood and bone, and born from the sperm and ovumof our parents. The \"subtle body\" refers to the abiding energy channels, theflowing energies, and the emplaced red and white [i.e., female and male]creative drops. The \"very subtle body\" is the subtle energy that supports theconsciousness of the four emptinesses, especially the fourth emptiness, called\"utter emptiness,\" which is the clear light mind....As for the mind, it also has these three dimensions. The \"coarse mind\" refers tothat co-emergent with the five sensory consciousnesses. The \"subtle mind\" isthat co-emergent with the driving force of the six root distortions, the twentysecondary distortions, and the eighty conceptual mindsets. The \"very subtlemind\" is the dimension of consciousness that is in the same nature as the fouremptinesses, and especially the fourth, \"utter emptiness,\" the clear light mind.A major aim of the completion stage yogas is to separate these three sheathes ofthe body, thus separating the frequency of the consciousness that arises fromthe physical bases. In this way the meditator achieves an increasingly subtleinner meditative environment.This technology of radically refining the physical base in order to refine thestate of consciousness is thus effected in two quantum leaps. This is one of theprincipal reasons that the tantric path is referred to as the quick path toenlightenment. The more subtle the physical base during meditation, the moresubtle will be the consciousness that arises; and the more subtle theconsciousness that applies a given spiritual technique, the more powerful thatmethod becomes. This is the underlying tenet of the maha-anuttara-yoga tantras."},{"pageContent":"THE PHYSICAL EXERCISES AND MEDITATIONS UPON THE EMPTY SHELL BODYTsongkhapa recommends that, before entering into the actual practice of the SixYogas, we engage firstly in the special physical exercises and then in themeditation upon the body as an empty shell.The purpose of doing these as a preparation for each meditation session upon theSix Yogas is given slightly later in Tsongkhapa's text:When we meditate on the chakras, it is sometimes difficult solely by means ofgentle preparatory methods to induce a state of samadhi having the ability tocontrol the vital energies and to open the energy channels. When these moreforceful preliminaries are done, there is less chance of undesirableside-effects occurring.The tradition of physical exercises associated with the Six Yogas of Naropa issignificant, and is one of the few examples of hatha yoga being practiced by theTibetans. It spread from the Six Yogas lineage into other tantric traditions inTibet.Some manuals on the Six Yogas system speak of large numbers of differentexercises. For example, the manual of Perna Karpo, the twenty-fourth patriarchof the Drukpa Kargyu school, lists the possible numbers of the differentphysical exercises that can be adopted as \"...six, ten, twenty or fifty.\"\" Also,Jey Sherab Gyatso states in his Notes,There are a wide variety of traditions on the physical exercises associated withthe Six Yogas of Naropa, such as the set of six, the set of thirty-two, and soforth. The Pakmo Drupa and Drikung Kargyu schools both maintain a tradition of108 exercises.... However, there seems to be no great advantage in doing morethan the six recommended by glorious Pakmo Drupa.Here the six recommended by Pakmo Drupa are the same as the six included byTsongkhapa in A Book of Three Inspirations, for Tsongkhapa generally followsPakmo Drupa on such technicalities throughout his treatise. Tsongkhapa describesthese in some detail, but we should remember that the verbal description of eachis not sufficient to convey the exact practice to the trainee. Traditionallythese are physically demonstrated by the teacher when the disciple arrives atthe appropriate stage in training.These exercises are practiced in conjunction with the meditations on the body asan empty shell. Tsongkhapa describes this process as follows,One commences as before with the practice of visualizing oneself as the mandaladeity. The special application here is to concentrate on the body, from the tipof the head to the soles of the feet, as being utterly empty of materialsubstance, like an empty transparent balloon filled with light.The purpose of doing these two together-the physical exercises and the emptybody-is also stated by Jey Sherab Gyatso in his Notes:If one enters into the completion stage yogas [such as the Six Yogas of Naropa]without first achieving great stability in the generation stage yogas, there isthe danger that one will experience considerable physical pain as a result ofthe changing energy flows. To avoid this, one should do as many of the physicalexercises as possible, in conjunction with the meditation on the body as anempty shell. When stability in these practices is achieved, one will experiencea sense of subtle joy that pervades the body, and the possibility of painarising in the body or mind will be eliminated. When progress in the practicecomes without pain or hardship, this indicates that one is proceeding correctly.Having prepared the groundwork in this way, Tsongkhapa now introduces thesubject of how the actual Six Yogas are to be practiced. Thus the remainder ofhis treatise is dedicated to the treatment of the individual Six Yogas."},{"pageContent":"SECTION TWO OF TSONGKHAPA'S TEXTTsongkhapa the Great structures the Six Yogas of Naropa as follows: (1) theinner heat, (2) the illusory body, (3) clear light, (4) consciousnesstransference, (5) forceful projection, and (6) the bardo yoga. As he points out,the bardo yoga is presented together with the illusory body doctrine, forreasons explained later in his text. He then states that the order of theindividual six as listed does not indicate that they are practicedconsecutively, and that in fact most manuals do not explain them in this order.Two yogas not separately mentioned above as being among the Six Yogas, but whichare included within them, are those of dream and sleep. Tsongkhapa's text speaksof \"the daytime practice\" and \"the sleeping practice.\" The latter includes bothdream and sleep yogas. As he explains, most manuals on Naropa's Six Yogas placethe explanation of dream yoga in the section on the illusory body doctrine, andplace the explanation of sleep yoga in the section on the clear light doctrine.Consequently, because the illusory body doctrine is generally presented inmanuals prior to the presentation of the clear light doctrine, dream yoga oftenends up being taught before sleep yoga. However, in the actual training onewould have to become proficient in meditating on the clear light of sleep beforesucceeding in the dream yogas.The idea behind the structure of the Six Yogas system as arranged by Tsongkhapa,at least the three of them that fall under the categories of \"foundation\" and\"actual path\" as mentioned above, is that the inner heat yoga (the foundation)is used to bring the subtle energies into the central channel, melt the subtledrops, and give rise to the tantric blisses. The overwhelming physical ecstasythus invoked, said in tantric scriptures to be a hundred times more intense thanordinary sexual orgasm, gives rise to a special state of consciousness. This isfocused in meditation on emptiness, the ultimate nature of being, and theecstasy conjoined with the wisdom of emptiness emerges. This state of mind isthe trademark of highest yoga tantra, and therefore of the Six Yogas tradition,and it is this to which the term mahamudra refers in Gelukpa tantric literature.This \"ecstasy conjoined with (the wisdom of) emptiness\" is the force then usedto embark upon the \"actual path,\" i.e., the illusory body and clear lightpractices.Tsongkhapa is very direct on the importance of establishing this ecstasyconjoined with the wisdom of emptiness as the inner basis:In general, all systems of highest yoga tantra's completion stage involve thepreliminary process of controlling the vital energies flowing through the twoside channels, rasana and lalana, and redirecting them into the central channel.This is indispensable.There are numerous means for accomplishing this, based on the traditions of theIndian mahasiddhas, who drew from the various tantric systems. In this tradition[i.e., the Six Yogas of Nampa] the main technique is to arouse the inner heat atthe navel chakra, the \"wheel of emanation,\" and then through controlling thelife energies by means of the AH-stroke mantric syllable, to draw the subtlelife-sustaining energies into the central channel. When these energies enter thecentral channel the four blisses are induced, and one cultivates meditation onthe basis of these in such a way as to give rise to the innate wisdom ofmahamudra.Otherwise, if one does not rely upon a profound path of this nature [i.e., inwhich the basis of the meditation is not the innate ecstasy conjoined withwisdom awareness], but instead engages a samadhi that merely maintains a stateof non-conceptual absorption for a prolonged period of time, no great signs ofprogress will be produced.To illustrate the point, he refers to the first meeting between Milarepa andGampopa, in which Milarepa asked about Gampopa's meditation. Gampopa repliedthat he could sit in meditative absorption for many days at a time withoutdistraction. Milarepa told him, \"You cannot get oil by crushing sand. Thepractice of samadhi is not sufficient in and of itself. You should learn mysystem of inner heat yoga....\" The implication is that the innate ecstasyconjoined with wisdom awareness, which is aroused by the inner heat yoga, wasabsent, and thus Gampopa's samadhi lacked real tantric power. Arousing that\"real tantric power\" is the purpose and territory of the inner heat doctrine."},{"pageContent":"THE INNER HEAT YOGAThe purpose of the inner heat doctrine is to bring the energies into the centralchannel at the heart chakra, melt the \"drops\" and give rise to the specialtantric ecstasy. This bliss is then utilized in extraordinary ways.The Sanskrit term for inner heat is chandali, which the Tibetans translated astummo (Tib. gTum mo). It is a feminine noun, with the sense of both fiercenessand heat.14 In the Six Yogas system, wherein the chandali practice is derivedfrom the Hevajra and Chakrasamvara tantric cycles, this power of inner heat issymbolized by the mantric syllable known in Tibetan as ah tung (Tib. a Chung),or \"the short AH,\" a Sanskrit participle somewhat resembling the exclamationmark in English, or, as Ngulchu Dharmabhadra puts it in An Ornament for A Bookof Three Inspirations, \"somewhat like an upright thom.\" In other words, itresembles a toothpick standing up on its thicker end. Chogyam Trungpa refers tothis Sanskrit participle as \"the AH-stroke.\"15 It is always visualized in itsSanskrit form, in contrast to the practice used by Tibetans with almost allother mantric syllables of visualizing them in their Tibetan forms.As Tsongkhapa points out, there are three principal elements involved in themeditations for igniting the inner heat: meditating on the channels; meditatingon the mantric syllables; and meditating in conjunction with the vase breathingtechnique.In the first of these the three energy channels are envisioned as running up thecenter of the body, with the chakras at the four upper sites: crown, throat,heart and just below the navel. One can also visualize four lower chakras,beginning at the navel and going down to the tip of the jewel. Beginnersgenerally work primarily with the four upper chakras, and most texts on the SixYogas do not give much detail on the four lower ones.In the second step of the inner heat yoga, a mantric syllable is placed at thecenter of each chakra. Here Tsongkhapa gives the advice,Moreover, one should concentrate on the syllables of the upper three chakras forjust a short period of time, and then dedicate most of the session to meditatingon the AH-stroke at the navel chakra.Jey Sherab Gyatso clarifies this point in his commentary, and addresses thetopic of the dangers that arise through incorrect practice:There is no one standard way of engaging in the inner heat yoga. For example,the size in which the energy channels are visualized varies in accordance withthe capacities of trainees. Similarly, the chakra recommended as the site atwhich to draw the energies into the central channel varies. However, there isless danger of undesirable side-effects when one works with the chakra at thenavel. Consequently the two side channels are generally visualized as curlinginto the mouth of the central channel at the site of the navel chakra. It isbest to firstly establish control over the subtle energies at the navel chakra.Should one try to do this at any of the three upper chakras and apply thetechniques forcefully, there is the danger that the upper energies will bedisturbed and that negative side-effects will be produced, such as intenseturbulence of the heart energies, and so forth. Similar dangers are associatedwith working with the secret chakra. There are numerous ways of visualizing themantric syllables in the practice of the inner heat, as well as of retaining theenergies, and in how the inner heat that is induced behaves.[../Images/img0002.jpg]The AH-stroke syllableIn the third step, one engages in the exercises of breath control and retentionin order to intensify concentration and redirect the vital energies.Tsongkhapa elaborates these techniques as follows,Meditating like this on the inner heat yoga has the purpose of inducing the fourblisses. To effect this, first the bodhimind substance in the channels must bemelted, and together with the vital energies must be brought to the chakra atthe crown. This generates the first bliss, known simply as \"bliss.\" Thesubstances in the channels again flow, and then collect at the chakra at thethroat; the second bliss, known as \"supreme bliss,\" is aroused. Again thesubstances flow, and then collect at the chakra at the heart; the third bliss,known as \"special bliss,\" arises. Fourthly, the energies collect at the chakraat the navel; the bliss known as \"innate bliss\" is induced.He cautions,The bodhimind substance that resides in the upper chakra is melted and broughtto each of the four chakras, where it must be retained. If one cannot hold it inthe chakras for a prolonged period of time one will not be able to appreciatethe uniqueness of each of the four experiences of bliss. In particular, one willnot be able to discern the uniqueness of the fourth, the innate bliss.He then speaks of how one manipulates the subtle energies in order to cause themto enter into, abide, and dissolve within the central channel. The nature of thelanguage in this part of the text could perhaps be called tantric psycho-speak.The ideas reflected here of the interwoven nature of the body and mind, and therelationship between the mind and the body's subtle structures of \"channels,\"\"winds,\" and \"drops\" that must be \"melted and brought to the heart,\" arefundamental to the Vajrayana. Learned tomes have been written by Westernscholars on the psychological, spiritual and biophysical implications of thechakra system; and all of this is useful in helping Occidentals get a grip onwhat is being talked about in the tantric process. However, traditional tantricliterature prefers to maintain a language strongly characterized bymultidimensional ambiguity, where the process is presented by symbol and flowrather than being reduced to a static verbal concept.Thus Tsongkhapa can quite easily say,The earth energies dissolve into those of water, and the miragelike sign isbeheld; the water energies dissolve into those of fire, and there is the sign ofsmoke; the fire energies dissolve into those of wind, and the sign of sparks,like flickering fireflies, appears. Then the energy that carries conceptualthought dissolves into mind, and there is an appearance like that of the lightof a butterlamp undisturbed by wind.It is said that the strength of the experiences indicated by these signs willeventually carry one to the stage wherein the realization of mahamudra isachieved.On the one hand the language is very earthy, speaking of what seem to be merelythe coarse elemental dissolutions. The result is realization of mahamudra, thehighest wisdom. Suddenly in the space of a sentence we have jumped from themundane to the super-transcendental.In this way the inner heat is used in order to withdraw the coarse energies intothe subtle, and to melt the drops, thus refining the basis from whichconsciousness arises. Tsongkhapa sums up the dynamics of the process,As explained earlier in the description of the descending process, the bodhimindsubstance is melted and arrives at the chakra at the tip of the jewel. If onecan retain it without ejaculation, the innate ecstasy will be aroused. At thattime one must engage mindfulness of the view of emptiness to be ascertained, andmust place the mind firmly there. Rest within the inseparable ecstasy and[wisdom of] emptiness. Even if you do not have a profound understanding of theemptiness doctrine, at least avoid all distractions and rest in the singularecstasy of the experience until the absorption becomes stable, mixing this withthe beyondconceptuality consciousness.While doing this, retain the bodhimind substance in the jewel chakra for sometime. Then reverse it, bringing it back up to the crown chakra. This gives riseto the \"rising-from-below\" innate wisdom. Identify this clearly in theawareness, and then fix the mind in the sphere of ecstasy conjoined with [thewisdom of] emptiness. If this is impossible, then simply try to rest the mind inthe ecstasy and to blend this with the beyond-conceptuality consciousness.Remain in that state for as long as possible. This is the manner in which onecultivates the experience during formal meditation sessions.As for how to cultivate the training during the post-meditation periods, oneshould note that in general merely the presence of the innate ecstasy inmeditation does not mean that the realization will automatically carry over intothe post-meditation periods. The ecstasy that was experienced will notnecessarily become manifest in the objects that appear during everydayactivities. That by itself is not enough. During the post-meditation periods onemust consciously cultivate mindfulness of the experience of ecstasy andemptiness, and stamp all objects and events that appear and occur with the sealof this ecstasy and emptiness. This application causes a special ecstasy to beignited, which one should foster.The nature of the physical heat generated by the practice has attractedconsiderable attention from Western medical and scientific circles. In Tibet theculmination of a three-year retreat would often see the testing of thegraduating yogis. This test was conducted by putting wet sheets over theshoulders of the naked yogis, at sub-zero temperatures, and seeing who could drythe most sheets in a given time period. Clinical experiments conducted by Dr.Herbert Benson of Harvard University on some yogis chosen by the Dalai Lama forthe purpose showed the yogis easily raising their external body temperatures byup to fifteen degrees within a few moments of concentration.\" Tsongkhapa speaksof this extraordinary side-effect of the training,The inner heat that can be aroused is of various types. For example, there isthe inner heat in the central channel, that is first aroused in the chakras atthe navel and secret place, and there is the inner heat that blazes andincreases outside the central channel. Secondly, there is the heat that isaroused from the depth of the body, and also the heat aroused at the surface,between the skin and flesh. Then there is the heat [that seems to pervade]narrow [areas of the body], and the heat that seems to pervade large areas, asaroused on initial stages of practice. Then there is the heat that rises slowly,and the heat that arises quickly. Also, there is the heat that seems thick, andthe heat that seems thin. In each of these pairs, the first is better than thesecond. The second indicates an inferior experience.A Western vipasyana meditator once commented to me that the inner heat yogaswere very important to the Tibetans, due to Tibet's cold climate, but that theyweren't as relevant to Westerners, whose houses have central heating. What hefailed to appreciate is that the physical heat is just a side-effect of thepractice, and not the purpose or function of it. The inner heat doctrine isengaged in order to gain control over the subtle bodily energies and chemicalprocesses, as a means of melting the drops and giving rise to the tantricbusses. This ecstasy then acts as the rocket fuel of the tantric spaceadventure. Control over the physical processes, such as the heating functions,are encompassed by the process, but are not the primary aim of it. As Tsongkhapapoints out, this control over the subtle bodily processes, and the ability todirect the subtle energies and drops that it brings with it, comprise anindispensable foundation of all highest yoga practice. Arousing this control isthe essential purpose of the inner heat doctrine."},{"pageContent":"KARMAMUDRATsongkhapa concludes his section on the inner heat doctrine with a discussion ofthe all-important karmamudra, the \"action seal.\" This refers to the tantrictradition of sexual practice with a consort. Karmamudra in this context refersto an actual sexual partner.The early masters in the Six Yogas lineage placed great emphasis on karmamudrapractice. Marpa Lotsawa spoke of the doctrine as one of his four most treasuredinstructions. In Milarepa's enumeration of the Six Yogas quoted by Tsongkhapa,karmamudra practice is listed separately as one of the six. Ngulchu Dharmabhadraalso mentions an alternative structure of the Six Yogas given by Tsongkhapa, astructure that lists karmamudra as one of the Six Yogas, and relegates the bardoyoga to the status of a branch of the illusory body doctrine.However, in the system as transmitted by Gampopa to Pakmo Drupa, the karmamudrayoga is not taught separately; rather, it is presented as a branch of the innerheat yoga. Because Tsongkhapa's treatise follows the tradition of Pakmo Drupa,it does the same.The reason for linking the inner heat and karmamudra yogas in this way iselucidated in Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations:The inner heat yoga gives rise to the simultaneously born bliss. This ecstasythen acts as a simultaneously present condition for the practice of the sexualyogas, or karmamudra. Therefore the expression \"inner heat karmamudra\" is used.In other words, in order to successfully engage in the karmamudra practice onemust have control over the bodily energies, a control that is acquired by meansof the inner heat yogas. When this has been made firm and the innate blissestablished, the karmamudra practice is applied in order to make the quantumleap from the stage of inner heat yoga to that of the illusory body yoga.The need for engaging in karmamudra practice in connection with inner heat yogais explained by Ngulchu Dharmabhadra in his treatise on the Six Yogas, AnOrnament for A Book of Three Inspirations. Earlier we spoke about the process ofseparating the three dimensions of the body and mind: coarse, subtle and verysubtle. The various stages of this process are spoken of as \"the threerefinements,\" the three being body refinement, energy refinement and mindrefinement. The process of energy control that is the function of the inner heatyoga carries one through these \"refinements.\"The idea here is that most of the vital energies can be brought under controland directed into the central channel solely by means of the inner heat yogastogether with the vase breathing technique. However, the \"all-pervading energy\"is difficult to control, and it is in order to subdue this that the practice ofkarmamudra is required. As Ngulchu puts it,Through meditating on the inner heat and gaining a basic mastery of the process,one comes near to the stage of achieving the semblant clear light andactualizing final mind refinement. The inner yogas by themselves will not beable to induce the jump to that stage; for this, the inner yoga must besupplemented with the external condition of relying upon a karmamudra, or sexualpartner.The key expression here is \"final mind refinement.\" This is a technical termreferring to the stage wherein only the all-pervading energy remains to bebrought under control. Once it has been mastered, one makes the quantum leap tothe accomplishment of \"final mind refinement,\" which permits the manifestationof the illusory body. It is to cross this threshold that the yogi enters intounion with a karmamudra.It is said that most monks and nuns in Tibet did not engage in the karmamudrapractice, but instead took up the sexual meditations using a jnanamudra, orvisualized consort. Whether or not this is true, or if it is just a way ofmaintaining the secrecy of the practice, is a point of doubt.\"Tsongkhapa speaks of the qualifications required of one who would engage in thekarmamudra yogas:Here both oneself and the mudra should be beings of highest capacity, and shouldhave received the pure empowerments. Both should be learned in the root andbranch guidelines of tantric practice, and have the ability to maintain themwell. Both should be skilled in the sadhana of the mandala cycle, and mature inpracticing four daily sessions of yoga.Also, they should be skilled in the sixty-four ways of sexual play as describedin A Treatise on Bliss. They should be mature in meditation upon the doctrine ofemptiness; be experienced in the techniques for inducing the four blisses ingeneral and the innate wisdom awareness in particular; and be able to controlthe melted drops and prevent them from escaping outside.Such are the characteristics required of the practitioners as described in theoriginal tantras and also in the treatises of the [Indian] mahasiddhas.However, the karmamudra practice should not be casually engaged. As Tsongkhapaputs it,Those not qualified to take up the karmamudra practices should instead engage inprolonged meditation upon a jnanamudra [i.e., a visualized consort], such as themandala dakinis Nairatmya and Vajrayogini. When the practice achieves stabilityand the visualization arises with total presence and radiance, one can enterinto sexual union with this visualized consort and arouse the four blisses. Theinnate ecstasy emerges, and one unites this with [the wisdom of] emptiness, thusblending mindfulness of the view [of emptiness] with the great ecstasy. This isthe experience known as ecstasy and emptiness in union.If one is unable to do this, one simply relies on ecstasy and cultivates thesamadhi that rests one-pointedly within that bliss.In fact there are four mudras upon which the yogi can rely for this aspect ofthe training: karmamudra, jnanamudra, mahamudra, and samayamudra. The FirstDalai Lama (b. 1391) explains these as follows in his treatise on the Kalachakrasystem of completion stage yoga,'8The first three of these give rise to the immutable ecstasy. The fourth is saidto be the mudra experienced as a result of accomplishing the former three.Karmamudra is explained as a maiden possessing the physical attributes of awoman, who comes to one as a result of one's previous karma. Here there is noneed to visualize the experience; the maiden herself has the ability to inducethe full experience by means of her skillful embrace.Jnanamudra is a maiden created through the power of one's visualization.As for the mahamudra, the images within one's own mind spontaneously arise asvarious consorts.... One then unites with these.Through relying upon these three types of mudra, one is led to the experience ofecstasy. The bodhimind substances residing in the upper sites fall to the tip ofthe jewel, where they vibrate and transform. They are retained here and are notallowed to slip away....If the yogi is not able to move the male and female drops of his body solelythrough the power of meditation, he is instructed to take up practice with akarmamudra. Because the karmamudra gives him the power to direct the vitalsubstances to the tip of the jewel, she is called \"the maiden who bestows thefalling ecstasy\"....The yogis...are of three types: sharp, middling and dull. The first of theserely exclusively upon mahamudra. They are able to experience the immutableecstasy solely through union with her. The second must rely upon a visualizedjnanamudra in order to generate a basis of ecstasy through which they are ableto enter into the mahamudra experience. Thirdly, those of dull capacity, nothaving the strength or purity of mind, must rely upon a karmamudra until theygain experience of great ecstasy. Only then can they proceed to the mahamudra.This passage occurs within the context of the Kalachakra system, which variesconsiderably from the Hevajra and Chakrasamvara tantric cycles upon which theinner heat doctrine of the Six Yogas is based. Nonetheless it does succinctlyexplain the purpose of training with a karmamudra at this point in the process,and the characteristics of the practitioner who should rely upon a karmamudra.Ngulchu Dharmabhadra's An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations provides uswith some detail on the types of karmamudras that are considered to beappropriate partners for the sexual yogas, as taught in the Indian treatises onthe practice:The types of mudras upon which one should rely are classified in various ways.For example, they are spoken of as being fourfold in dependence upon theircaste: mole-bearing outcasts; courtesan dancers, flower sellers, andwasherwomen.They are also spoken of as being fourfold in accordance with the shape of theirlower aperture: lotus-like, conch-like, antelopelike, and elephant-like. Herethe lotus-like is best. They are threefold in dependence upon their realization.In this context they are known as mantra-born, place-born and innately born.The mantra-born mudra refers to an ordinary female who has purified her mind bymeans of the general Mahayana trainings, received the complete tantricinitiations, and maintained the tantric precepts and guidelines. On thosefoundations she has become fluent and skilled in the generation stage yogas, andhas achieved realization of the initial stages of the completion stage yogas,thus becoming a yogini born from mantra realization.The place-born mudra is one who resides in one of the sacred tantric sites, suchas any of the twenty-four Heruka sites and so forth. As for the innately bornmudra, this refers to a yogini who abides in union with the clear lightrealization.When both a qualified relier and a relied-upon practitioner take up the activityof meditating within the environment of sexual union, they can use theexperience to cause the vital energies to enter, abide and dissolve within thecentral channel. The drop is brought to the jewel chakra and retained therewithout being allowed to leave. The melting and blisses are induced, and theseare used to propel the meditator through the stages of final mind refinement.Gelukpa literature tends to be somewhat discreet in its discussion of the topicof karmamudra practice due to the sect's emphasis upon monastic purity. As aconsequence, much of the knowledge on the subject remains solely within the oraltransmission. This should not be taken to mean that the practice is not honoredor maintained within the Gelukpa tradition, but rather that the secrecy of thepractice is stressed.The subject of karmamudra practice is introduced to the trainee for the firsttime at this point in the inner heat yoga. It will continue to re-appear in theremaining practices of the Six Yogas, where it will be used to propel thetrainee from the top of one stage of realization to the beginning of thesubsequent stage."},{"pageContent":"THE ILLUSORY BODY YOGATsongkhapa begins his treatment of the illusory body doctrine with a discussionof the term \"illusory body\" as it is used in the Guhyasamaja system, from whichthe topic is derived for the Six Yogas. He also discusses how this compares tothe manner in which most oral transmissions of the Six Yogas present thesubject. He is not particularly impressed by the standard presentation andobviously prefers the greater sophistication of the original Guhyasamaja system.The Guhyasamaja tradition speaks of the yogas of \"body refinement,\" \"speechrefinement,\" and \"mind refinement.\" These respectively refer to the process ofseparating the three aspects of form, energy and awareness-coarse, subtle andvery subtle-from one another. The illusory body is produced on the basis of thethird of these three physical dimensions. That it to say, one can only manifestthe illusory body on the basis of having established \"body, speech and mindrefinement.\" If the illusory body doctrine is to be engaged as an actual highestyoga tantra practice, that must be its basis.There is also a discussion of two levels of this illusory body: unpurified andpurified. The former is known as \"the illusory body of the third stage\" and thelatter as \"the illusory body of the fifth stage.\" The former is concomitant withthe attainment of arya status; the latter is what arises as the Rupakaya infinal enlightenment.In Tsongkhapa's opinion, many transmissions of the Six Yogas overly simplifytheir presentation of the illusory body, and most of them fail to appreciatethese quintessential principles of the Guhyasamaja doctrine. As he puts it,These are the principles on which the illusory body doctrine [of Lama Marpa'stradition of Guhyasamaja] is based; but we do not see them discussed in thistradition.Instead there is a discussion of an unpurified illusory body that is linked tothe practice of observing one's image reflected in a mirror as a means ofcutting off the coarse conceptual mind, such as thoughts of pleasure ordispleasure at likes and dislikes. Then there is a discussion of a purifiedillusory body, which is linked to the practice of meditating upon the illusorynature of one's own body envisioned as that of a mandala deity, which induces astate of one-tasteness that does not discriminate between likes and dislikes.Yet these two [\"unpurified\" and \"purified\" as described above] are only\"illusory bodies\" in a general sense common to both highest tantra and otherpaths. They are to be distinguished from the \"unpurified illusory body\" that isthe third stage [of the Guhyasamaja five-stage system], known as \"the hiddenessence of illusory nature\"; and the \"purified illusory body\" that is the fifthstage, also known as \"the illusory body of the stage of great unification.\" Itseems that this distinction is not even roughly made here.The actual illusory body is exclusive to highest yoga tantra. The first\"illusory body\" described above [i.e., observing one's image in a mirror, etc.]does not even really qualify as a general-nature illusory essence; and thesecond one [i.e., meditating on the illusory nature of oneself as a mandaladeity] is also found in the three lower classes of tantras [and hence is noteven exclusive to highest yoga tantra].Following Tsongkhapa's guidelines, Gyalwa Wensapa describes the manner ofimplementing the illusory body doctrine in A Source of Every Realization: TheStamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa:After applying oneself to the technology for directing the vital energies intothe central channel, one eventually achieves a mature meditative absorptionfluent in the process. Soon one perceives the signs of approaching the stagewherein the illusory body can be produced.From within the sphere of sexually uniting with a karmamudra, which is the outersupporting condition, one engages the inner supporting condition, which refersto meditating on the channels, chakras, and so forth; and meditating upon theblazing and melting. The vital energies are caused to enter into the centralchannel, and to abide and dissolve, giving rise to the signs of thedissolutions, from the mirage and so forth until the sign of the clear light.The four emptinesses emerge in the nature of the four blisses. When the innateclear light arises, one meditates upon ecstasy conjoined with emptiness. This isthe technology for engaging the innate semblant clear light, with which thebasis of the illusory body is produced.When the time comes to emerge from the clear light, one arouses the instinct toset aside one's old aggregates, and to take the form of a Buddha Vajradhara,male and female in union. Then as one arises from the clear light, the vitalenergy of the five radiances, upon which rides the innate semblant clear light,serves as the substantial cause; and the mind itself serves as thesimultaneously present condition. Based upon these, the old aggregates arebypassed, and one arises in the form of a Buddha Vajradhara, male and female inunion, adorned by the marks and signs of perfection. This is the stage of the\"unpurified illusory body.\" Simultaneously one experiences the dissolutionprocess in reverse, going from clear light to proximate attainment, and soforth, until the sign of the mirage.In systems such as the Guhyasamaja Tantra this illusory body is illustrated andexplained by using twelve similes.At that time three factors occur simultaneously: the cessation of the innatesemblance [i.e., the \"semblant\" or \"metaphoric\" clear light consciousness]; thefulfillment of proximate attainment in the dissolution process; and arisal inthe actual form of an \"unpurified illusory body.\"Tsongkhapa comments that his criticism of the treatment of the illusory bodydoctrines in most oral transmissions of the Six Yogas lineages applies equallyto the doctrines of clear light and yuganaddha, or \"great union.\" He feels thatmany of his contemporaries would do well to read up on the Guhyasamaja tantricliterature and thus achieve an understanding of the basics. He does not mincehis words on this theme,As had been pointed out earlier, the doctrines of the illusory body and clearlight yoga have their source in the Guhyasamaja Tantra. According to the oraltradition of this tantric system coming from Arya [Nagarjuna] and his disciples,a transmission known as the \"Arya Cycle,\" for as long as the vital energies havenot been drawn into the central channel and caused to abide and dissolve, onewill not be able to generate the samadhi of the threefold experience of\"appearance, proximity and proximate attainment\" associated with theaccomplishment of mind refinement; and it is only from the state of vitalenergies and consciousness that have generated the complete signs of the wisdomawareness of mind refinement that the qualified illusory body yoga can beengaged.In the Six Yogas system the illusory body training is divided into threeaspects: training in seeing the illusory nature of \"appearances,\" whichencompasses everything that we experience in waking life; training in awarenessof the illusory nature of dreams; and training in the illusory nature of thebardo. Thus here again we see the \"three bardo states\" discussed earlier.In the first of these, one channels the vital energies into the heart chakra,and gives rise to the experience of the elemental dissolutions, until the greatecstasy and the clear light consciousness arise. This is then focused inmeditation upon emptiness. In post-meditation periods one brings this \"ecstasyand emptiness\" into one's everyday experience. As Tsongkhapa puts it,During meditation sessions one invokes the great ecstasy, uses this as thedriving force in the focus upon the view of emptiness, and then restssingle-pointedly within that absorption of beyondconceptuality mind. Betweensessions one cultivates the awareness of how emptiness and conventionalinterdependent existence complement one another.In this way the two [formal sessions and between-session trainings] are appliedin rotation as complementary to and supportive of one another.This section of the text contains some of Tsongkhapa's finest expressions of hisapproach to emptiness; for meditation upon emptiness here is integral to theapplication. He writes,This awareness of emptiness is simply an appreciation of the primordialnon-inherently abiding nature of things. It is not a mental fabrication. Nor isit a partial emptiness that [is the nature of merely some phenomena and] doesnot pervade all objects of knowledge. By placing one's awareness on this finalmode of being, all the forces that eliminate the syndrome of grasping at an \"I\"are strengthened.The next aspect of the illusory body training involves working with the dreamstate. In the actual application of dream yoga it is necessary to borrow thetechnology from the clear light doctrine related to meditating on and retainingthe clear light of sleep; for although a small degree of dream yoga can beimplemented on the basis of conscious resolution conjoined with a conventionalmeditational technique, such as shamata or vipasyana, the degree of proficiencyrequired in the Six Yogas emanates from the foundation, the inner heat doctrine,and what the meditator has achieved by means of it in terms of the yogic abilityto induce the elemental dissolutions and consciously experience the stages ofthat dissolution, from the vision of the mirage up to the emergence of the clearlight.The ability to induce these dissolutions and retain them at their various phasesduring waking state meditation is instrumental to the application of thetechnology at the time of sleep and dream. Tsongkhapa points this out again andagain. When the ability is present in the waking state, implementing it in sleepand dream is a simple matter. As he puts it,In the first of these... during the waking state one gathers the vital energiesinto the central channel and dissolves them, inducing the experiences of thefour emptinesses. The manner of the application is that in the process of firstretaining the clear light of sleep one cultivates awareness of the fouremptinesses of sleep. After that, when dreams occur one recognizes them as such.When awareness of the four emptinesses of sleep is present, no other techniquefor retention of awareness in dreams is required.The methods of implementing the dream yoga for those not having competence inretaining the clear light in meditation is explained in detail in A Book ofThree Inspirations. Tsongkhapa elucidates the theory of sleep and dreammanipulation by means of the chakra technology: which chakras to work with ifsleep is too light or too thick; which energies to re-adjust when dreams are tooobscure or intense, and so forth. The study of dreams is a new science in theWest; for tantric Buddhists, it is an ancient art. Tsongkhapa comments,If one performs the above practice at the throat chakra at dusk or after dawnand still one is not able to retain one's dreams, this indicates that thepractitioner is a person who naturally sleeps very deeply. To somewhat lightenthe nature of sleep one should place the mind on the crown chakra.If in turn this causes one to be unable to sleep, or to sleep fitfully, thenconcentrate instead on the drop at the secret place. Here during the daytime onecultivates resolution as described earlier, and works with the chakra at the tipof the jewel. Before going to sleep one visualizes there a dark drop, and unitesthe vital energies twenty-one times [through vase breathing]. Within thatsphere, and without letting the mind stray, one drops off to sleep.Sometimes working with the upper sites causes one's sleep to become too light.If this occurs, one should keep in mind that the chakra at the jewel is alsoassociated with the sleep state, and therefore placing the mind on it willaffect the depth of one's sleep. One must know how to work with the differentchakras at dusk and dawn in this way in order to bring the elements [i.e., thedrops within the chakras] into balance.The dream yoga begins with cultivating the ability to retain dreams, which meansthe ability to recognize the dream as a dream while dreaming, without disturbingthe flow of the content of the experience. In other words, one cultivates thetechnology of meditating throughout the sleep process, firstly absorbed in theclear-light-ofsleep meditation, and later, when dreams begin to occur, absorbedin dream yoga.Tsongkhapa elucidates the main obstacles to be overcome in achieving progress inthe endeavor, and the principal techniques involved in the application. He thendeals with the methods of healing fears and obsessions that manifest in dreams,learning to cultivate out-ofbody experiences in sleep, and so forth."},{"pageContent":"THE BARDO YOGAIn the Six Yogas tradition the dream and bardo yogas are usually grouped withthe illusory body doctrine, as Tsongkhapa puts it, \"for the sake ofconvenience.\"The reason that it is convenient to do so is because there is a common elementshared by the illusory body, dream body and bardo body. All three of thesephysical bases are experienced when some or all of the coarse energies have beenwithdrawn from the coarse body, and thus all three arise from a more subtlephysical base. Also, in all three situations the coarse sensory and conceptualconsciousnesses have withdrawn into a more subtle dimension of the mind.Consequently in all three instances the consciousness based on that body issomewhat subtle, as compared to ordinary waking consciousness.Tsongkhapa explains the complementary nature of the three illusory bodypractices as cultivated in the three bardo states:...previously [one had gained proficiency] in the yogas of the clear light ofsleep and of arising in the illusory body of the dream state. Familiarity withthis technique causes the strength of one's illusory body practice to increaseduring the waking state, and that in turn supports one's practice of generatingthe illusory body of the dream state.Should death arrive before supreme enlightenment has been attained, and onewishes to apply the yoga for enlightenment at the time of death, then [as thedeath process sets in] one engages the yogas of controlling the vital energiesin order to recognize the clear light of the moment of death, using the sameprinciples that were applied in the yoga of retaining the clear light of sleep.In this way one enters into the bardo experience, applies the techniques learnedthrough the yoga of the illusory body of dreams, and generates the bardo body asthe illusory body of the bardo.Here Tsongkhapa is establishing a link between three elements, and associatingthese with a kaya. There is the clear light as experienced in the waking stateby means of the tantric yogas, the clear light of sleep, and the clear light ofthe moment of death; these are associated with the Dharmakaya. Then there is theillusory body, the dream body and the bardo body; these three are associatedwith the Rupakaya, in its two forms of Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya.Again, to contextualize the bardo doctrine he once more refers to theGuhyasamaja tradition,Here the Arya Cycle of the Guhyasamaja tradition speaks of how the experience ofthe four emptinesses [of appearance, proximity, proximate attainment and clearlight] give rise to the clear light. This is experienced much the same way asthe clear light of death is experienced after the dissolution of bodilyprocesses is complete. The yogi then produces the illusory body [by means of thefour emptinesses and blisses mentioned above]; this is similar to how the bardobody is produced [after the clear light of death]. This [i.e., the illusorybody] becomes the subtle Sambhogakaya, which takes upon itself a coarseNirmanakaya form, much in the same way that the bardo body takes rebirth with aworldly form.A Book of Three Inspirations provides an excellent analysis of the bardo stateas recorded in the Sutrayana's Abhidharma19 literature, and then explains howthis is implemented as a yoga in the highest yoga tantra systems.As explained earlier, the Six Yogas tradition speaks of three bardo states:those of the waking state, dream state, and after-death state.How do we proceed in the training of these three bardos? Tsongkhapa poses thequestion, and then offers this answer:Here during the waking state one practices meditation on the inner heat yoga,thus causing the vital energies to enter into the central channel, and to abideand dissolve. Through the force of this experience one induces the experiencesof the four emptinesses, four blisses, and the clear light consciousness. Theexperience is like that of the time of death, when the vital energies andconsciousnesses naturally withdraw from the body into the central channel andthe clear light of death manifests.The meditations on the three clear light consciousnesses-the clear lightexperienced through yogic endeavor in the waking state, the clear light ofsleep, and the clear light of the moment of death-are similar in that all threerequire that one understand the process of dissolving the vital energies andconsciousnesses into the central channel just as at the moment of death, and howthus to induce the experience of the four emptinesses and four blisses.If one understands these three sets of three processes, then in the waking stateapplication the subtle illusory body can take the form of a coarse Nirmanakaya.Also, the dream yoga can be used in the gap at the end of dreams and beforewaking up to cause the subtle Sambhogakaya [generated in dream yoga] to take acoarse Nirmanakaya. Similarly, after the moment of the clear light of death haspassed and one enters the bardo, the same technique can be used to transform thebardo body into a Sambhogakaya form; and that in turn can be used to take acoarse Nirmanakaya form.This process is sophisticated, and one should attempt to get a clearcomprehension of it. If one can gain insight into the basic principles at workin the dissolutions, then the three blendingsthe clear light of death with theDharmakaya, the bardo body with the Sambhogakaya, and the rebirth body with theNirmanakayacan be accomplished.In the formal list of the Six Yogas, the bardo doctrine appears as the last ofthe six. However, in the order of explanation it is placed with the illusorybody yoga, due to the \"illusory\" nature of the bardo body. As we read thissection we must keep this idiosyncrasy in mind. Several topics discussed heremay not make sense until one has read the next section of the book, that on theclear light, for some ideas are borrowed from that doctrine. Thus when set asthe sixth and last of the Six Yogas, the bardo doctrine fits more neatly into asequential progression: inner heat is the foundation; illusory body and clearlight the main body of the path; consciousness transference and/or forcefulprojection branches of the path to be applied in times of emergency or in one'stwilight years, in order to by-pass the bardo entirely; and, finally, if none ofthis works and one finds oneself entering death's gates, there is the doctrineof bardo yoga."},{"pageContent":"THE CLEAR LIGHT YOGAThe clear light doctrine encompasses two modes of practice: meditating upon theclear light during the waking period; and meditating upon it during sleep.A Book of Three Inspirations speaks in depth on the various usages of the term\"clear light\" as it appears in the various Buddhist scriptures. NgulchuDharmabhadra summarizes the essence of Tsongkhapa's analysis in An Ornament forA Book of Three Inspirations:The term \"clear light\" is used in many different contexts: \"common\" and\"uncommon\" clear lights; the \"clear light as object\" and the \"clear light assubject\"; and the \"hidden meaning clear light\" and \"final significance clearlight.\"Of these, the expression \"clear light as object\" refers to the emptiness of allphenomena, which means the manner in which they are free from the extremes ofreification and nihilism. \"Clear light as subject\" refers to the mind of theperceiver of that object. These usages are common to both the Hinayana andMahayana vehicles, and to all four classes of the Mantrayana. This is alsotermed \"the clear light of general significance.\"The \"uncommon clear light\" is a special application of the term as it appears inhighest yoga tantra. It refers to the clear light as subject, wherein the\"subject\" is the innate great ecstasy focused in perception of clear light asobject, the emptiness nature of phenomena.This highest yoga tantra usage of \"clear light as subject\" speaks of the clearlight at the occasions of basis, path and result. Here \"clear light as basis\"refers to the natural clear lights of sleep and death, and is experienced evenby ordinary beings, although they do not recognize it. The \"clear light of thepath\" refers to the semblant and actual clear lights. Because this clear lightof the path is only experienced by highly trained yogis, it is also called \"thehidden clear light.\"Again, with the semblant clear light there is both a \"proxy semblant clearlight\" and an \"actual semblant clear light.\" As for the \"actual clear light,\"there is the \"actual clear light of the fourth stage\" and the \"actual clearlight of the fifth stage.\" Finally, \"the clear light of final significance\"refers to clear light mind as experienced on the stage of yuganaddha, or greatunion. Because this state of great union has two levels, i.e., those of trainingand beyond training, this \"clear light\" is also of two types, based on those twolevels of spiritual attainment.Generating the experience of this \"actual clear light\" is the main purpose ofhighest yoga tantra. The semblant clear light is but a means to that end. A\"proxy illusory body\" produces the experience of the semblant clear light, andthe actual illusory body produces experience of the actual clear light. Thisexperience is most easily aroused by meditating on the inner heat at the heartchakra.Let's examine the various usages listed by Ngulchu Dharmabhadra, beginning withthe \"common\" and \"uncommon.\" Here the \"common clear light\" refers to what isunderstood by \"clear light\" in the exoteric Mahayana and esoteric Vajrayanascriptures and in all four classes of tantras. That is to say, the usage is\"common\" to the various yanas. The \"extraordinary clear light\" refers to theexclusive usage of the term as it appears in the scriptures of highest yogatantra.As Ngulchu explains, the \"extraordinary clear light\" as used in highest yogatantra refers to an aspect of consciousness perceiving emptiness, or \"clearlight as subject.\" The \"clear light as object\" simply refers to the emptinessthat is the object perceived by this consciousness. Tsongkhapa points out in ABook of Three Inspirations that this \"extraordinary clear light consciousness,\"otherwise known as the \"clear light as subject,\" is invoked by meditating uponthe inner heat yoga and thus giving rise to the elemental dissolutions, untilthe blisses are generated and the clear light mind arises. This blissful clearlight mind is then retained and brought into focus on emptiness.Ngulchu mentions \"clear light as basis, path and result.\" The \"basis clearlight\" is equally possessed by all living beings, from the highest to thelowest, and from the most evil to the most enlightened. The \"clear light of thepath\" is the \"basis clear light\" as brought into conscious experience by meansof the tantric yogas; because it is not perceived by ordinary living beings, butonly by those trained in the yogas, it is also known as \"the hidden clearlight.\"The \"clear light of the path,\" i.e., as experienced through the tantric yogas,has many levels of realization. The two principal of these are known as\"semblant\" and \"actual.\" Both of these have a \"proxy\" and an \"actual,\" whichrefers to the manner in which the various phases of the illusory body yoga areintegrated into the clear light yoga. The \"semblant\" is experienced on the thirdof the five stages leading to full enlightenment, wherein one achieves aryastatus; the \"actual\" is experienced on the fifth stage, known as yuganaddha, or\"great union,\" which is the stage of final enlightenment. As Ngulchu states,this \"great union\" also has two stages, and thus there are two levels of theexperience of the clear light consciousness associated with it.The various levels through which practitioners evolve as they manifest thestages of realization of the illusory body and clear light are based upon theapplication of the inner heat yoga. Thus the inner heat is \"the foundation,\" andthe illusory body and clear light yogas are \"the actual path.\"Earlier we saw how these two elements-illusory body and clear lightrealizations-develop in reliance upon one another. The dynamics of this process,as Tsongkhapa states several times in his treatise, is lucidly explained in theFive Stages tradition of the Guhyasamaja tantric cycle. Jey Sherab Gyatsoadvises us in his Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations:It is important to critically examine the teachings of Lama Tsongkhapa in orderto plant the instincts of realization. In particular, three of his tantricworks-A Book of Three Realizations (Tib. Yid ches gsum Idan), A Clear Lamp onthe Five Stages (Tib. Rim Inga gsal don), and The Complete Seat (Tib. gDanrdzogs)-should be studied in conjunction with one another. Then an inconceivableunderstanding is produced. This is especially important in gaining profoundappreciation of the illusory body and clear light doctrines.The first of these three texts, of course, is the treatise translated here.Tsongkhapa divides the actual practice of the clear light doctrine as taught inthe Six Yogas of Naropa into two: how to train in the waking state; and how totrain in the sleep state.Practice of the clear light yoga during the waking state essentially refers toengaging in the inner heat yoga in order to collect the vital energies into thecentral channel and cause them to abide and dissolve, melting the drops andgiving rise to the blisses and the experience of the four emptinesses. The signsof the elemental dissolutions occur, from the mirage up to the clear light. Theecstasy of the clear light experience is conjoined with meditation uponemptiness, and the clear light is then retained. Tsongkhapa describes it asfollows,One places the mind firmly... causing the energies from the side channels ofrasana and lalana to enter, abide and dissolve within the central channel,arousing the four emptinesses, and giving rise to the amazing clear lightconsciousness of the path. When this occurs one observes the mind of the greatinnate ecstasy and then holds to it.The application here seems to be what Evans-Wentz and DawaSamdup included intheir Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines20 as \"The Yoga of the Long HUM.\" This isthe absorption of the world and its inhabitants into light and then into oneselfas the Samayasattva, or \"Symbolic Being.\" This dissolves into the mantricsyllable HUM at one's heart, which is the Jnanasattva, or Wisdom Being, thesymbol of the ultimate nature of one's own mind. This in turn dissolves intolight, from the bottom upward, into clear light. As the HUM dissolves, thestages of the dissolution process are invoked, and the according visions appear,beginning with the mirage up to the clear light. When the clear light ecstasyemerges one unites it with emptiness meditation. Thus we have the \"short AH\" (orAH-stroke) of the inner heat doctrine, and the \"long HUM\" of the clear light.The training in cultivating the clear light of sleep entails a more specifiedapplication, and thus, as with the dream yoga, involves working with thedifferent chakras in order to finely tune one's sleep patterns and bring theminto harmony with what is required for the implementation of the yoga.The principle behind the clear-light-of-sleep doctrine is described as followsin A Book of Three Inspirations,In general it is said that the drop which supports the experience of the deepsleep state naturally resides in the heart chakra. When one utilizes this as apath one can induce an amazing experience of the clear light of sleep. Even whenit is not utilized as a path, the vital energies naturally withdraw into thisdrop when one goes to sleep. Hence if during the waking state one cultivates theability to bring the vital energies into the central channel, and when going tosleep applies the meditations described above, maintaining the visualizationsinside the central channel at the heart chakra, it becomes quite easy to bringthe energies into the central channel at the heart....The illusory body and clear light doctrines, powered by the inner heatapplication, are explained as being the main body of the path; thus they are theprincipal means for inducing the experience of enlightenment. Tsongkhapa pointsout that the manner in which these two work together is presented with greatestclarity in the Arya Cycle of Guhyasamaja doctrines, and thus this aspect of themshould be gleaned from that source.This takes us to the last two of Naropa's Six Yogas, both of which arecategorized as \"branches of the path,\" namely, consciousness transference andforceful projection."},{"pageContent":"THE CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFERENCE YOGAThe premise behind the doctrine of consciousness transference is that the stateof one's body and mind at the moment of death makes a tremendous difference tothe experience of dying, and to how one will enter the bardo. This affects theoutcome of the bardo experience, and the subsequent rebirth.Various techniques are taught in the Sutrayana and Mantrayana for working withthis situation.\" The technique advocated in the Six Yogas system comes from thehighest yoga tantras. Its key point is that it aims to prepare the death channelby means of yogic application during one's lifetime, so that when the moment ofdeath comes one can slip gently out of the body via this passage, and project ortransfer one's consciousness to a desired rebirth, such as in a buddhafieldparadise, or as a tantric practitioner in the human realm. This death channel iseasily prepared by means of yogic application, especially if maturity in theinner heat, illusory body and clear light yogas has been established. However,as A Book of Three Inspirations states, \"it is best to undertake the trainingwhen one is not weakened by disease.\" To prepare the death passage, one shouldengage in the yoga while still having full strength.As Tsongkhapa points out, there are a wide range of consciousness transferencetechniques available from the different sutra and tantra sources; and, evenwithin highest yoga tantra, a wide range of practices exist. As he puts it,There are a number of oral tradition teachings on the subject. That known as\"consciousness transference by means of the four techniques\" and also the Ngoklineage of consciousness transference provide wonderfully detailed presentationsof the meditations involved. However, in this tradition [i.e., the Six Yogas ofNaropa], the oral transmissions of most lamas present the instructions ofconsciousness transference based on oral transmission alone.He then summarizes the practice as follows,Here the oral tradition suggests that one visualize oneself as one's mandaladeity, and bring the vital energies into a kiss at either the secret place orthe navel chakra. One then envisions the red AHstroke syllable at the navelchakra; at the heart chakra, a dark blue HUM; and at the crown aperture, a whiteKSHA.Now one pulls up forcefully on the vital energies from below. These strike theAH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra, which then rises and strikes the HUM atthe heart. This rises and strikes the KSHA at the crown. Then the process isreversed: the HUM comes back down to the heart chakra; and the AH comes backdown to the navel chakra.Here sometimes it is said that the AH-stroke syllable dissolves into HUM [andthat into the KSHA] during the upward movement. The approach as described aboveis more effective.One should apply oneself to this training until the signs of accomplishmentmanifest, such as a small blister appearing on the crown of the head, asensation of itching, and so forth.In this way the death passage is opened. Then at the \"time of actualapplication,\" which means the moment of death, one engages the same yoga as hadbeen used to open the death passage, and exits the body consciously.Tsongkhapa quotes from The Diamond Sky Dancer Tantra (Skt. Vajradaka tan tra),in which it is said,One purifies the limit of the residence. Having purified it, one implements thetransference. Otherwise, there will be no benefit.He explains that the phrase \"limit of the residence\" refers to the human body,the residence within which we live. He then says, \"To try and engage thetransference yogas without first having purified the body by means of the innerheat yoga explained earlier will produce no meaningful results.\" In other words,the power used to clear the death passage emanates from the inner heatapplication.Tsongkhapa keeps his discussion of the consciousness transference doctrinebrief; for, as he states, he has written on the subject in detail elsewhere.\""},{"pageContent":"THE FORCEFUL PROJECTION YOGAMost commentaries to the Six Yogas written in the last three or four hundredyears do not count forceful projection, or \"drong-juk\" (Tib. grong 'jug), as oneof the six. Usually only a paragraph or line is dedicated to it, placeddiscretely at the conclusion of the explanation of consciousness transference.To compensate for the deletion, either karmamudra yoga or dream yoga is elevatedto the status of one of the \"Six Yogas\" to make up the number six. The logic ofdeleting it is that theoretically this doctrine is no longer practiced; or, ifit is, it is used only in the strictest secrecy. The usual explanation is thatthe practice lineage died with the mysterious death of Marpa's son Darma Dodey,to whom the lineage had been passed.The practice itself is exotic: transferring one's consciousness into a freshcorpse. To get the hang of it, one begins by training in the technique by meansof attempting to revitalize the bodies of small animals. Eventually one can workup to the real thing, a human corpse. Tsongkhapa describes in detail how thecorpse is placed on a mandala table in front of oneself, and the meditationsconducted. At the time of actual application one fetches a fresh corpse from thecharnel ground, places it cross-legged on the table, sits facing it, andprojects one's consciousness into it, thus reviving it. One then cremates one'sold body, and goes on about one's business in one's new residence.Why would one want to do such a thing? Tsongkhapa offers this answer:The reasons for performing forceful projection into another residence can bemultifold. For example, there are those of inauspicious lineage who find thatthey are unable to accomplish great deeds for the benefit of the world due tophysical limitations, and thus may feel it expedient to acquire a moreappropriate body. Also, perhaps a physical illness renders one unable to benefitoneself or others, and therefore one is moved to acquire a healthy body.Similarly, one may be afflicted by old age and thus be moved to acquire ayouthful body.Although this all sounds a bit far-fetched, and quite rightly is included in theSix Yogas only as an auxiliary practice, the subject seems to have been of greatinterest to eleventh-century India and Tibet. For example, it is said that whenMarpa's son, to whom the technique of forceful projection had been given, felloff his horse and was about to die, he quickly projected his consciousness intothe body of a pigeon and flew away to India. There the pigeon alighted on thebreast of a young boy who lay dead on a funeral pyre. Marpa's son then projectedhis consciousness out of the body of the temporary vehicle, the pigeon, intothat of the boy. The pigeon fell over dead, and the boy sat up. He became knownas Tipupa, the Pigeon Mahasiddha. A generation later Milarepa sent one of hisdisciples, Rechungpa, to study with Tipupa in India.Biographies of the Indian mahasiddhas and yogis of the period are filled withsuch anecdotes. The tradition continued in Tibet, especially with the earlyKargyupa lamas. Yogis quite casually throw their spirits into the bodies ofgeese, foxes or other creatures, leaving their human body behind in a state ofsuspended animation, and then come back some time later, exiting the borrowedbody and re-entering the old aggregates. Marpa is said to have demonstrated thisphenomenon several times to his disciples.Of course, corpses for the practice were far more easily acquired in those days.Only the wealthy were cremated. Most towns and cities had a charnel groundnearby, where the dead were brought and deposited, to be offered as food to thewild animals and vultures as a final act of generosity. A yogi would have a goodselection of bodies from which to choose.These charnel grounds were favored meditation places for the Indian mahasiddhas.Usually they were located at the edge of a jungle and thus had a host of wildanimals, from tigers to jackals, looking to them as a food source. Many of themahasiddhas practiced meditation in charnel grounds. Often these were locatednear a city, and thus had a hefty turnover of bodies. It is said that thesimultaneous presence of decomposing corpses and hungry scavengers provides anenvironment most conducive to tantric meditation.A rumor concerning the doctrine of forceful projection is that originally therewere two techniques: one for projection into a corpse; and another forprojection into a living being. It was the second application that caused theconsternation that led to the mysterious death of Marpa's son and the ostensibleending of the lineage.2sTsongkhapa also mentions two applications for \"drong-juk\": forcefully projectingone's consciousness into a fresh corpse in order to take up residence there;and, secondly, offering one's own body to someone in need, by means offorcefully projecting their consciousness into one's body, and vacating it forthem. Tsongkhapa does not say much on the subject of the second application,for, as he puts it, \"This second tradition is not publicly taught by the gurus.\"The qualifications of the practitioner of these branch practices are describedas follows:With all three practices-consciousness transference, forceful projection [into acorpse], and projecting someone out of their body into one's own body-onerequires the ability to block the flow of energies by placing mantric syllablesat the gates, and also the ability to purify the gates by means of using thevase breathing technique to direct the vital energies into the central channel.And one needs the ability to control the red element, [symbolized by] theAH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra, by means of the inner heat yogas, andutilize it to arouse the consciousness that rides upon the subtle energies,represented by the HUM at the heart chakra."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUDING NOTESHaving elucidated the key principles in the tradition of Naropa's Six Yogas inconsiderable detail, Tsongkhapa wraps up his treatment with an account of howthis all translates into the experience of enlightenment:After the stage of the great union of a trainee has been achieved one entersinto meditation on the clear light, through which all instincts of the confusedstate of grasping at duality are washed away. Then at the time of finallymanifesting the Dharmakaya, the illusory body of the practitioner on the stageof the great union of a trainee utterly transforms and becomes an illusory bodyof the great union beyond training. That illusory body will not falter for aslong as samsara exists.At that point the clear light as an object [i.e., emptiness] possessing the twopure qualities becomes the Uncompounded Dharmakaya. The clear light as subject[i.e., as the perceiving mind] becomes what is known as the Jnana Dharmakaya, orWisdom Truth Body, and as the Mahasukhakaya, or \"Great Ecstasy Body.\"The support of that [Dharmakaya state] is the Rupakaya, created solely from [themost subtle levels of] energy and mind of the form-aspect of the being. This isthe Sambhogakaya....Here this illusory body of the stage of the great union transforms into theNirmanakaya, and is able to send forth countless emanations.Gyalwa Wensapa provides a similar presentation in A Source of Every Realization:The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa:The yogi on the stage of great union of training cultivates the absorptions ofthat level during both formal meditation and postmeditation sessions, andeventually sees signs of the approach of the attainment of great union beyondtraining. He engages the external condition of uniting with a karmamudra, andthe internal condition of meditating single-pointedly on emptiness, causing thevital energies to enter into the central channel, and to abide and dissolve. Thesigns occur, beginning with the mirage and so forth, until eventually the signsof the clear light manifest. The four emptinesses arise in the nature of thefour blisses.... The moment this innate clear light manifests, one engages themeditation of ecstasy conjoined with [the wisdom of] emptiness. The first momentof this clear light is the unobstructed stage on which the perceptualobscurations (Skt. nyer avarana; Tib. shes sgrib) are transcended. The secondmoment of it is also the first moment of omniscient buddhahood, wherein oneremains in perfect absorption upon the final nature of being, while at the sametime directly seeing all conventional realities as clearly as a piece of fruitheld in the hand. The body of great union of training becomes the great unionbeyond training, the actual Sambhogakaya endowed with the kisses of the sevenexcellences, and that sends out thousands of Nirmanakaya emanations to benefitthose to be trained. Thus one achieves complete buddhahood in the nature of thethree kayas.Tsongkhapa concludes his treatise with a summary of the early lineage, earlyliterary sources connected with the Six Yogas tradition, and his account of whyand for whom he composed the text."},{"pageContent":"THE SIX YOGAS OF NAROPA IN ENGLISH TRANSLATIONThe first full translation of a Tibetan text on the Six Yogas to have beenpublished in English seems to be that included by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup and W.Y. Evans-Wentz in their volume Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines. Like all fourvolumes brought out by this team, the edition has the blessing of a reasonablywell-qualified Tibetan lama as the translator, and the genius of Evans-Wentz aseditor. The shortcoming of all four volumes is that the lama died before most ofthe material was published, and Evans-Wentz did not know Tibetan. Thus they wereedited and annotated from his notes, and from what he could glean from diversesources. The outcome, although not always accurate, is true to the spirit of themany texts they brought out together. Their rendition of Pema Karpo's treatiseon the Naropa tradition is one of their best efforts.Certainly the most clearly reasoned presentation of the Six Yogas in English isthat provided by Herbert Guenther in The Life and Teachings of Naropa (Oxford,1963). Here we have a traditional explanation of the system blended in with thestory of Naropa's training under Tilopa; and then Guenther's existentialanalysis.Garma C. C. Chang (also known as Chang Chen Chi), a Chinese Chan scholar, alsobrought out two translations, one being the treatise of Karma Tashi Namgyal, aprominent sixteenth-century writer in the Karma Kargyu school; and the otherbeing a rough draft translation of Tsongkhapa's treatise.The latter project began in the late 1950s, when an American scholar, Dr. C. A.Muses, acquired a number of Tibetan manuscripts, mostly initiation manuals. Hehired Garma C. C. Chang to translate them, and in the process borrowed a copy ofTsongkhapa's treatise, A Book of Three Inspirations, from the American Libraryof Congress, having Chang bang out a quick translation while he was on theproject.An immediate problem was that Chang had a strong sectarian aversion forTsongkhapa, doubtless acquired during his brief training in a small, provincialKarma Kargyu monastery in Kham, eastern Tibet. His contempt floods onto thepages of his book, especially the footnotes, in arrogant, tasteless andirrelevant remarks. To make matters worse, Chang was mostly trained in Chan, andonly poorly so in Tibetan Buddhism, with no prior exposure to Gelukpaliterature. Thus he was ill-equipped for the task given to him.After completing a rough translation of Tsongkhapa's treatise, Chang had afalling-out with Muses, leaving the latter to complete the editing work. Thisrough draft, minus corrections and polishing, was destined for the publishers,and came out in the volume entitled Esoteric Teachings of the Tibetan Tantras(Falcon's Wing Press, 1961). Besides being exceedingly unpleasant in itstreatment of the author whose work it translates, it contains literally hundredsof errors.When my publishers at Snow Lion approached me with the request to prepare adecent translation of Tsongkhapa's treatise on the Six Yogas, I hesitated toaccept. However, my editor asked that at least I check the Chang translationagainst the Tibetan original before deciding. I agreed to do so.To compare Chang's translation with Tsongkhapa's original work I chose thesampling approach, flipping through the Tibetan loose leaf text at random,reading a passage, and checking to see how Chang had translated the piece.In the first passage to which I opened A Book of Three Inspirations, Tsongkhapadiscusses the importance of gaining maturity in the generation stage yogasbefore going on to the completion stage applications. He quotes a verse from theHevajra Tantra, wherein it is said, \"Abiding equally in the two stages oftantric practice / Is the Dharma taught by Buddha Vajradhara.\" His point is thatthe generation stage yogas are an indispensable preliminary to the completionstage. Chang's translation reads, \"If one says the two Yogas are equal, / It isa Dharma-infant's preaching.\" Goodness, I thought, that's a bit off. Either hehad an edition with terrible misprints, or had been drinking heavily that night.I flipped to a different passage, in which Tsongkhapa is in the middle of adiscussion centering on the mandalas that are best adopted for the generationstage practice in conjunction with the Six Yogas. He comments,Thus there are these two mandalas [Hevajra and Heruka Chakrasamvara, that havebeen used by great lineage masters of the past]. The teaching on tummo, theinner heat yoga, is common to both of them. Thus either mandala practice isappropriate...I turned to Chang's translation:Although there are two such transmissions (of the Luipa sixtytwo deity mandalaof Chakrasamvara), they both provide the methods of producing bliss and joy;therefore the practice of either one will do.Essentially he had misread the Tibetan abbreviations of the names of themandalas of the tantric deities Chakrasamvara and Hevajra, or De Kyey (Tib. Wedgyes), rendering them as \"...bliss and joy,\" and thus missing the whole pointof what is being said. To compensate for his confusion, he had tagged the entirepassage onto what had previously been said about the Luipa transmission of theChakrasamvara mandala, and hoped for the best. His gamble didn't work.Tsongkhapa is saying that one should use either the Hevajra or HerukaChakrasamvara mandalas for the generation stage yogas, because the tummoteaching is the same in both of them; Chang has him saying that either one ofthe two Chakrasamvara lineages in the tradition of the Indian mahasiddha Luipaare equally appropriate because \"they both provide methods of producing blissand joy.\" Of course there is no tradition of speaking of two Luipa lineages ofthe Chakrasamvara mandala, but Chang doesn't seem to have known this.On my third test Chang went from very bad to much worse. Tsongkhapa isdiscussing a number of lineages of simpler mandala practices associated with theChakrasamvara cycle that can be adopted if one finds the Luipa tradition ofChakrasamvara or any of the four families of Hevajra to be too complicated. Hestates,The mandala should be at least as complete as that of the fivedeity HerukaChakrasamvara mandala of the Ghantapada tradition. Adopting one of the abovemandalas as the basis, one engages in the practice in four daily yogic sessions.Chang renders this as, \"One should thus practice the Yoga of Four Periods whichwill lead to the unfoldment of the Mandalas from the feet-the Five Buddhas andBells-to the head.\"Hummm, I thought again, that's certainly very, very off. He had completelymisread the name of the Indian mahasiddha whose lineage was being referred to,known in Tibetan as Tilbu zhab Jib. Dril bu zhabs), or Ghantapada in Sanskrit,which literally means \"Bell Feet.\" This really threw Chang for a loop.Actually, the mahasiddha's name was \"Bell,\" or \"Ghanta\" in Sanskrit. The \"Feet\"(Skt. pada; Tib. zhabs) part of the name is merely an honorific that can betagged on to the end of almost any name. The mandala and its lineagetransmission is always referred to as Tilbu Lha Nga (Tib. Dril bu Iha Inga), or\"Bell's Five Deities,\" Bell being the Indian mahasiddha Ghantapada, and themandala named after him having five deities. Chang had just tossed the words ina hat, shaken them around a bit, and read them however they came out, likeWilliam Burroughs' thing with cutting up newspaper columns and then arbitrarilygluing the pieces together. It is amazing that he did not recognize Ghantapada'sname, for Naropa's guru Tilopa had himself mainly practiced the generation stageyogas based on the Chakrasamvara mandala known as \"Bell's Five Deities.\"My next divination landed me in the introductory section of the illusory bodydoctrine, which in the Six Yogas system is said to be extracted from theGuhyasamaja Tantra. Tsongkhapa lists a dozen points of the doctrine that are notdiscussed in the Six Yogas transmission, but are fundamental to the process astaught in the Guhyasamaja system. The concept was obviously too much for Chang,and he simply states, \"Again, there are instructions such as given here....\" Hethen goes on to list as contents of the Six Yogas teaching the dozen or sotopics that Tsongkhapa is saying aren't discussed in the Six Yogas.I continued with another half-dozen random samplings. Mistakes large and smallglared from the pages on each occasion.Finally I checked the colophon. Tsongkhapa comments,Even though this tradition [i.e., the Six Yogas] has inspired extraordinaryactivities in this part of the world over the past generations, these days thepractice of it is not particularly widespread. Yet there are many people withinterest in it, and therefore I thought that perhaps it may be useful to acceptthe request [to write this treatise].Chang comes up with the following,This book was written with the pure wish of spreading the Dharma of this school[Gelugpa, low school], which is thriving in this region to a great extent;however, it has not yet reached the fullflourishing state.He utterly misconstrues the passage. Why he bothers to foolishly throw theadjectival \"low school\" into the text in brackets in reference to the Gelukpa isanyone's guess.More irritating than Chang's many mistakes is his habit of continually throwinga barrage of insults at Tsongkhapa and the Gelukpa school originating in him.For example, footnote 55 reads, \"Here is shown Tsong Khapa's 'timidness' onShunyata, and his materialistic view is clearly reflected.\" This after he hastotally mistranslated the passage he is criticizing Tsongkhapa for writing!Footnote 91/92 reads,These statements reflect the typical polemic and pedantic character of TsongKhapa and many other Tibetan scholars, who have been busily engaging incontroversial argumentation on trifles and matters of secondary importance inthe past few centuries.... Few of them had a creative mind capable of producinga new philosophy like the glorious teachings of Hwayan and Zen Buddhism ofChina.Being a Gelukpa tantric practitioner myself, who in his youth had practiced Zen,I was becoming a bit irritated. Perhaps terming us the \"low school\" was theturning point in my reading. No one should have to pay good money to buy a bookby an author in whom they are interested, and then have to put up with suchutter silliness from the translator. I phoned up Snow Lion and agreed tore-translate the text for them.In the footnotes to my translation I point out some of Chang's most seriousmisreadings. I have limited these to gross distortions of historical orphilosophical import, as the errors number in the hundreds. However, I felt itnecessary to address the most serious of them, because early translations suchas his are often quoted or used as reference sources by Buddhologists not havingaccess to the Tibetan language, and hence these mistakes get repeated."},{"pageContent":"THE SEVENTH DALAI LAMA'S PRAYER TO THE SIX YOGASLINEAGEMost Dalai Lamas have received and practiced \"Naro's Six Yogas.\" The SecondDalai Lama (b. 1475) even wrote two treatises on the subject, one being apresentation of the tradition as a whole, and the other a summary of theprincipal meditation techniques involved. The Third Dalai Lama (b. 1543) wroteextensively on the five-deity mandala of the Heruka Chakrasamvara tradition ofthe Indian mahasiddha Tilbupa, or Ghantapada, which is the mandala most oftenused for the generation stage training by those embarking upon the path of theSix Yogas.The Seventh Dalai Lama (b. 1708) received three separate transmissions of theSix Yogas of Naropa from his senior tutor Trizur Ngawang Chokden (Tib. 'Khridzur ngag dbang mchog ldan). After the elderly guru had given the third and finaltransmission of the Six Yogas to the young Seventh Dalai Lama, he asked hisdisciple and successor to compose a prayer to the lineage masters. The Seventh,always quick to burst forth in verse, proceeded to do so. This brief poem/prayerwas included in my Selected Works of the Dalai Lama VII: Songs of SpiritualChange (Snow Lion Publications, 1982). Here the translation has been slightlymodified.The text is in three parts: the first invokes the names of the lineage masters;the second is the prayer of the actual Six Yogas; and the third is thededication.As is standard with lineage prayers, the Seventh Dalai Lama gives the name ofthe person who served as the principal lineage holder in each generation.Readers will recognize some of the names that appear in the list prior to thatof Tsongkhapa, for many of them are quoted in A Book of Three Inspirations, suchas Naropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, Pakmo Drupa, Drikungpa Jigten Gonpo, and soforth.The section of the prayer dealing with \"the path\" follows the structure of theoutlines provided in A Book of Three Inspirations: preliminaries derived fromthe shared path, preliminaries exclusive to tantric training, the generationstage yogas, and the completion stage yoga's Six Yogas.In this section the names of the lineage gurus are written phonetically, withoutformal spellings or dates. Anyone interested in such data can check the standardlineage manuals. We can presume that each master represents an average oftwenty-five years of history, for each name stands for a successive generation.Milarepa was born in 1040, so this gives a rough idea of the period of eachgeneration after him. Tsongkhapa (b. 1357) represents the twelfth generationfrom Milarepa, according to the chronology of the lineage given by the SeventhDalai Lama below.Namo guru daka dakini yeh! 0 all-pervading Heruka and your mandala of bliss, 0Tilopa, also known as the sublimely wise Jnanabhadra Who took the insight ofecstasy and void to its limits, And Naropa, an embodiment of Chakrasamvara: Irequest you, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom of ecstasy andvoid conjoined.0 Marpa Lotsawa, a crown ornament among vajra holders, 0 Milarepa, the LaughingVajra who gained the vajra ground, And Gampopa, the Doctor from Dakpo, he of thevajra family: I request you, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom ofecstasy and void conjoined.0 Pakmo Drupa, great protector of living beings, 0 Drikungpa Jigten RinchenGonpo, a guide to the living beings And Tsangpa Rechung, fulfiller of the needsof the world: I request you, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom ofecstasy and void conjoined.0 Jampa Palwa, a master translator, 0 Sonam Wangpo, a treasury of spiritualrealization, And Sonam Sengey, the great communicator: I request you, bestowblessings, that we may achieve The wisdom of ecstasy and void conjoined.0 Yangtsewa, who saw the essence of all teachings, 0 Buton Rinchen Drup, crownornament of the wise, And illustrious Khedrup Jampa Pel, learned andaccomplished: I request you, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom ofecstasy and void conjoined.0 Drakpa Jangchup, who gained the Dharma eye, 0 omniscient Tsongkhapa, a greatking of Dharma, And the Dharma heir Khedrup Palzangpo: I request you, bestowblessings, that we may achieve The wisdom of ecstasy and void conjoined.0 Jetsun Basowa, he of fabulous wisdom, 0 Chokyi Dorjey, who found the ground ofliberation, And Wensapa Lobzang Dondup,24 a most excellent spiritual friend: Irequest you, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom of ecstasy andvoid conjoined.0 Sangyey Yeshey, who destroyed all spiritual distortions, 0 Lobzang Chogyen,the all-seeing [First Panchen Lama], And Damchoe Gyaltsen, the great spiritualhermit: I request you, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom ofecstasy and void conjoined.0 Menkangpa, a lord of the secret yogas, 0 Lama Shri, who accomplished thesecret path, And Trichen Ngawang Chokden, lord of secret doctrines: I requestyou, bestow blessings, that we may achieve The wisdom of ecstasy and voidconjoined.And I call to the mandala deities: Heruka Chakrasamvara, in nature greatecstasy, Vajra Varahi, the dakini who bestows the four blisses, And the dakasand dakinis who always delight in bliss: I request you, bestow blessings, thatwe may achieve The wisdom of ecstasy and void conjoined.Inspire us to see that life is brief as lightning, and That all samsariccreations are in the end left behind, So that our minds may naturally attune tospiritual ways And may dwell in serene distaste for indulgence.Every living being in countless past lives Again and again has been a mother tous And has thus suffered physically and emotionally for us.

May their blessings pacify all negativeconditions And foster every situation conducive to growth and joy, That we mayquickly and easily cross the two stages Of the esoteric Mantrayana path.As with all lineage prayers associated with different lines of transmission, theverses to the early gurus are not originals by the Seventh Dalai Lama, butrather are traditional stanzas composed and handed down over the passinggenerations. The Seventh Dalai Lama probably just added the name of his ownguru, Trichen Ngawang Chokden. The remainder of the material is, of course, hisown original verse.I checked the lineage as recorded by the Seventh Dalai Lama against thoserecorded in several other lineage manuals. Up to the time of Tsongkhapa and hisimmediate successors the list was consistent in all of them. After that therewere divergences. It would seem from this that within the Gelukpa there was botha mainstream lineage of transmission, and also alternate transmissions that werepreserved in various monasteries and hermitages across Central Asia."},{"pageContent":"SOME HISTORICAL LINEAGE CONSIDERATIONSThe Gelukpa attitude toward the early Kargyupa lamas is that Marpa, his fourchief disciples (Lama Mey, Lama Tsur, Lama Ngokpa and Milarepa, foremost of whomwas Milarepa), and Milarepa's two chief disciples, Gampopa and Rechungpa(foremost of whom was Gampopa), were flawless exponents of the tantric doctrinesthat Marpa had gathered in India. Of Gampopa's four main disciples, each of whomformed his own sect (known as \"the four older Kargyupa schools\"), Pakmo Drupawas the one to receive the most comprehensive transmission, and thus isconsidered to be Gampopa's principal successor. Hence he is special among thefour. Tibetan historians therefore considered the Pakmo Drupa school to be themost authoritative of the four older Kargyupa schools in terms of representingthe totality of Marpa's legacy.This was the situation recorded by Tibet's greatest historian, Goe Lotsawa (b.1392), in his masterpiece, The Blue Annals (Tib. Deb ther sngon po; trans.George Roerich, Calcutta, 1949). Goe Lotsawa relates how one day the elderlyGampopa announced that henceforth Pakmo Drupa should sit at the head of anygathering in his monastery, thus pointing him out as his principal successor.Pakmo Drupa had eight disciples, each of whom founded a separate sect, whichtogether are known as the \"eight younger Kargyupa schools.\" Goe Lotsawa's BlueAnnals states that the most comprehensive transmission was that received byDrikungpa Jigten Gonpo (also known as Jigten Sumgon) (b. 1143), the founder ofthe Drikung Kargyu school. Most Gelukpas agree with Goe on this, and regard theDrikung Kargyu School to be special among the eight. Thus the Pakmo Drupa sectis first among the four older Kargyupa schools, and the Drikung Kargyu firstamong the eight younger. Therefore the lineage that Tsongkhapa the Greatrecommends, as demonstrated by the lineage prayer of the Seventh Dalai Lamaabove, lists the early transmission masters as Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, Gampopa,Pakmo Drupa and then Drikungpa Jigten Gonpo.Even though Tsongkhapa the Great, the founder of the Gelukpa school, was one ofTibet's most enthusiastic, prolific and articulate commentators on the doctrinaltransmissions coming from Marpa Lotsawa, who is regarded as the Tibetanforefather of the Kargyu school, relations between the Gelukpas and one of thetwelve Kargyupa schools, the Karma Kargyu, rather rapidly deteriorated. Numerousscholarly papers have been dedicated to the main events of this conflict, for inthe end it had far-reaching effects on Tibetan history.25What is of importance to our subject of study here is that the confused historythat the Gelukpa share with the Karma Kargyu has not obstructed the practice orpopularity within the Gelukpa of the lineages deriving from Marpa, Milarepa andGampopa, the early Kargyu forefathers. Marpa's Guhyasamaja transmissions havealways remained central to Gelukpa doctrine throughout the centuries; andalthough Marpa's tradition of Naro's Six Yogas does not play as primary a rolein Gelukpa doctrinal infrastructure as it does in the Kargyu schools, itnonetheless has attracted constant interest over the generations.When Gelukpa writers comment that firstly the Pakmo Drupa Kargyupa and then theDrikung Kargyupa founders received the most authoritative transmissions of MarpaLotsawa's lineages, this should not be taken to mean that they regard thelineages of the other ten Kargyupa schools to be inferior or less valid. Thesetwo are merely \"the most complete transmissions.\" Tsongkhapa makes this clear inhis closing comments in A Book of Three Inspirations,Marpa transmitted his lineage [of the Six Yogas of Naropa] to three of hisdisciples: Ngokton, Tsurton, and Milarepa. In turn, Milarepa transmitted hislineages to two main disciples: Chojey Gampopa and Rechungpa. The lineagedescending from Gampopa multiplied into many different forms, each with its ownspecialty, uniqueness and individual views on the different practices.The Gelukpa attitude is that each of the twelve Kargyupa sects holds lineagesthat are as powerful as those of the Pakmo Drupa and Drikungpa schools in termsof having the capacity to lead trainees to enlightenment. Therefore when it issaid that these two schools \"received the most authoritative transmissions fromGampopa,\" this does not imply that they were superior in a strictly spiritualsense. The idea is that the other ten Kargyupa schools were mainly givenstreamlined oral tradition teachings (Tib. man ngag) descending from Milarepaand focusing on practice, whereas the Pakmo Drupa and Drikungpa schools receivedthe totality of Marpa's lineages: the \"practice lineages\" (Tib. sgrub brgyud)from Milarepa, as well as the \"teaching lineages\" (Tib. bshad brgyud) from theother three of Marpa's four chief disciples (Lama Ngokpa, Lama Mey, and LamaTsur). For Tsongkhapa, this puts the Pakmo Drupa and Drikungpa schools insomething of a better position to discuss the underlying principles andphilosophy of the overall transmission.Although relations between the Karma Kargyu and Gelukpa schools have often beenstrained, nonetheless feelings of mutual respect have generally characterizedthe relationship between senior Karma Kargyupa and Gelukpa lamas over thecenturies. This is wonderfully exemplified by a short song spontaneously writtenin praise of Tsongkhapa by the Eighth Karmapa (b. 1507), who at the time was thesupreme patriarch of the Karma Kargyupa school and also a close friend of theSecond Dalai Lama. At the time of the composition the Eighth Karmapa wastravelling through the Charida mountains, when he experienced a vision ofTsongkhapa. He wrote:[../Images/page0103_0000.svg][../Images/page0103_0001.svg][../Images/page0103_0002.svg][../Images/page0104_0000.svg][../Images/page0104_0001.svg][../Images/page0104_0002.svg][../Images/page0104_0003.svg][../Images/page0104_0004.svg][../Images/page0104_0005.svg][../Images/page0104_0006.svg][../Images/page0104_0007.svg][../Images/page0104_0008.svg][../Images/page0104_0009.svg][../Images/page0104_0010.svg] [../Images/page0105_0000.svg][../Images/page0105_0001.svg][../Images/page0105_0002.svg]Something of the great Tsongkhapa's role in the transmission of the Six Yogaslineage may be gleaned from the closing lines of Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes,where he praises the lineage of the Six Yogas and its transmission throughTsongkhapa:Naropa's Six Yogas was the unique instruction of the early Kargyupa lamas. LamaTsongkhapa the Great received this tradition and later composed his treatise onthe system, A Book of Three Inspirations. Thus the Six Yogas came into theGandenpa [i.e., Gelukpa] order.The Kargyupas are especially renowned for their tradition of the Six Yogas, andtheir early lineage masters, such as Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, Pakmo Drupa andDrikungpa Jigten Sumgon, were flawless elucidators of the tradition. However, asthe lineage passed from generation to generation a large number of subtle pointsof confusion and error found their way into many of the oral transmissions. JeyGyalwa Nyipa [the Second Buddha, i.e., Tsongkhapa] removed these, and clarifiedall the key points and basic principles of the system. For this reason thelineage of Naropa's Six Yogas as practiced within the Gelukpa order today isespecially powerful....A Book of Three Inspirations is an inconceivably profound guide to the practiceof the Six Yogas of Naropa. Even if one searches throughout the three worlds ofexistence, one would find it difficult to discover a teaching equal to this workby Lama Tsongkhapa."},{"pageContent":"A PARTING PERSPECTIVE ON TSONGKHAPA THE GREATTsongkhapa's charisma as a teacher became legendary. Tibetans love to tell thestory of his first encounter with Gyaltsab Jey (b. 1364), who was destined tobecome his principal Dharma heir. At the time of their meeting Gyaltsab Jey wasa brilliant but rather arrogant monk of the Sakya school. He had heard ofTsongkhapa's reputation as a philosopher, and set out to challenge him to apublic debate.At the time of Gyaltsab Jey's arrival Tsongkhapa was teaching to a gathering ofdisciples. Gyaltsab Jey walked up to the front of the group and sat down besidethe master on the teaching throne. The disciples looked on somewhat aghast, butTsongkhapa spoke on without the slightest hesitation, and simply moved over onhis seat in order to offer Gyaltsab Jey a bit more space. In the end, GyaltsabJey walked to the back of the crowd, prostrated, and sat down to listen. Heremained with the master from that day onward, and when Tsongkhapa later passedaway, in 1419, he inherited the Ganden Throne.Tsongkhapa is sometimes portrayed in Western literature as a mere intellectual,but this view does not take into account his profound yogic accomplishments.Together with eight disciples he undertook a four-year Guhyasamaja retreat inthe Olkha Mountains in order to pursue intense meditation, and a few years laterspent another year in meditation retreat.26 During the four-year retreat, he andall but two of the eight disciples who accompanied him lived on only a handfulof juniper berries a day. Tsongkhapa is said to have prohibited the two elderdisciples from participating in this \"taking the essence\" (Tib. bcud len)approach to eating, and insisted that, in view of their age, they take normalfood.27 He himself, and the remaining six disciples, cultivated \"taking theessence,\" using juniper berries as the \"essence pills.\"Tsongkhapa lived in an intellectually vibrant period of Tibetan history, beforethe affliction of \"political correctness\" came into Tibetan thinking concerningsects and sectarianism. It was a time when lama philosophers could discuss anddebate inter-sect issues without being accused of being sectarian. GyaltsabJey's first meeting with Tsongkhapa reflects this.Perhaps the greatest example of this atmosphere comes in the person of one ofTsongkhapa's greatest philosophical antagonists, the Jonangpa lama BodongChokley Namgyal (b. 1376). This most extraordinary lama, who was also animportant guru of the First Dalai Lama (b. 1391), spent half his time writingabout the different Buddhist lineages of transmission in Tibet (his CollectedWorks contains over a thousand titles); the other half he spent wanderingthrough the monasteries and hermitages of the different sects, and challengingthe leading lamas to come out and debate their philosophy with him. Nobodythought him sectarian for doing so. If the monks in his targeted monastery wouldnot consent to meet him in debate he would sit in the courtyard, read from thetreatises of some of the monastery's most revered lineage masters, and chide themonks on points with which he disagreed, inviting anyone to come down anddiscuss the issue. His reputation intimidated many of those whom he challenged,and sometimes he would have to sit for days in the courtyard, singing songs andcomposing poems abusing the monks for not having the courage to defend theirlineage masters.Once he came to a monastery of the Sakya school, and the only monk who wouldconsent to meet him was the sixteen-year-old Khedrup Jey (b. 1385). Khedrup Jeyprevailed in the debate that followed, and the two became close friends. LaterKhedrup Jey became one of Tsongkhapa's chief disciples. In fact, his nameimmediately follows that of Tsongkhapa in the lineage of the Six Yogas ofNaropa, indicating that it was he who became the principal recipient ofTsongkhapa's lineage of the Six Yogas of Naropa. Moreover, after the death ofGyaltsab Jey, who had succeeded to Tsongkhapa's throne at Ganden Monastery,Khedrup Jey was installed as the Holder of the Ganden Throne.Tsongkhapa was made of the same mettle as was Bodong. His writings freelydiscuss the practices, theories and philosophies of different schools. Althoughno mention is made of the name of the lama or school whose trend on a giventopic is being criticized, any Tibetan intellectual of the period would know whowas being implicated in each instance. More importantly, the lamas whose viewsand practices were being challenged would know that the finger was pointing atthem. This wonderful, somewhat Socratic quality of fourteenth century Tibetanliterature becomes increasingly rare after the seventeenth century.Naropa's Six Yogas is an ancient legacy, with a glorious past and a strongpresence in the world today. At any given time there are at least a few dozenpractitioners engaged in the traditional three-year retreat focusing on thepractice somewhere in the world. There are tens of thousands who have receivedthe initiations and the transmissions, and who practice less formally. Moreover,there are millions across Central Asia who glowingly know of the system throughtraditional folklore and aspire to practice it, either in this lifetime or in afuture one."},{"pageContent":"A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONSA TREATISE ON THE STAGES OF TRAININGIN THE PROFOUND PATH OF NARO'S SIX DHARMASZAB LAM NA RO'I CHOS DRUG GI SGO NAS 'KHRID PA'I RIM PA YID CHESGSUM IDAN ZHES BYA BABY TSONGKHAPA THE GREAT,THE BUDDHIST MONK LOBZANG DRAKPA"},{"pageContent":"PROLOGUEWith great reverence I pay homage to the lotus feet of my spiritual masters, whoare inseparable from Buddha Vajradhara.'I bow at the feet of the glorious spiritual master, who In nature is a BuddhaVajradhara enriched in eight ways: Body, speech, mind, miraculous ability,omnipresence, Wish-fulfillment, excellence, and power.The [Indian] mahasiddhas Tilopa and Naropa Gathered the key points of theprofound tantric teachings Into the transmission known as \"Naro's Six Dharmas,\"The fame of which has spread into all directions.Having been repeatedly requested to write a commentary [to the Six Yogas ofNaropa], The request coming from one holding the ancestral lineage Of a being onthe exalted platform of serving as chieftain To fortunate trainees who appliedthemselves to this path,' I herein set forth this commentary to that profoundtradition.The explanation of the oral tradition teaching famed everywhere as \"the profoundpath of Naro's Six Dharmas\" (Tib. Zab lam na ro chos drug) is taught under twoheadings: the preliminary meditations, which build the foundations of this path;and, on the basis of those foundations, how one meditates upon the path."},{"pageContent":"THE PRELIMINARY MEDITATIONS, WHICHBUILD THE FOUNDATIONS OF THIS PATHThe preliminary meditations are of two categories: those preliminaries that aregeneral meditations derived from the common [i.e., exoteric] Mahayana, or GreatVehicle teachings; and the preliminaries that belong to the exclusive [i.e.,esoteric] Uttara-tantra-yana, or Highest Tantra Vehicle.'THE PRELIMINARIES THAT ARE GENERAL MEDITATIONSDERIVED FROM THE COMMON MAHAYANA TEACHINGSThe preliminaries derived from the common Mahayana are taught under two topics:a discussion of just why it is necessary for a training in this tradition [i.e.,in the tantric legacy of the Six Yogas of Naropa] to be preceded by a trainingin the practices of the common Mahayana; and the actual stages of training themind in that path [i.e., in the meditations deriving from the common Mahayanateachings].WHY IT IS NECESSARY FOR TRAINING IN THIS TRADITION TO BE PRECEDED BYTRAINING IN THE PRACTICES OF THE COMMON MAHAYANAOne certainly should train in the preliminary practices that are common to[i.e., shared by] both the [exoteric] Paramitayana [i.e., the common Mahayana]and the [esoteric] Mantrayana [i.e., the tantric vehicle].This is clearly stated by all the principal elucidators of this lineagedescending from Lama Marpa, including Lama Ngokpa, who quotes The Hevajra Tantra in Two Sections (Skt. Hevajra tan tra nama) as saying,4 \"Firstly impart theprecepts of purification,\" etc., until \"And after that teach the Middle View.\"[Lama Ngokpaj goes on to point out that this passage clearly teaches that thetrainee should first be led through the practices common to both Mahayanavehicles, i.e., the ordinary Mahayana and the esoteric Mantrayana. He commentsthat this is the advice found in all the original tantric scriptures.Also, it is recorded that when Venerable Milarepa taught the oral instructiontransmission for achieving liberation in the bardo he said,First establish the basics, such as Refuge in the Three jewels, the two aspectsof the enlightenment mind-aspirational and engaged-and so forth. Otherwise both[guru and disciple] will fall over the precipice of spiritual disaster, like twooxen yoked together.Like that, to take upon oneself the precepts [of tantric initiation] but not toguard them well will only lead both the spiritual friend [i.e., the guru] anddisciple over the precipice of disaster, like two oxen tied together in onework-harness.' Similarly, to enter into a high tantric practice merely becauseof having heard of its power and beneficial effects is an invitation todisaster.Thereafter Venerable Milarepa gave the initiation of the Yogini, and impartedthe oral instructions.The above expression \"the oral instruction transmission for achieving liberationin the bardo\" (Tib. bar do 'phrang sgrol gi man ngag) is synonymous [with theSix Yogas of Naropa]. The above manner of leading disciples [by firstlyestablishing them in the foundation practices] therefore applies equally toboth.'In particular, the Dharma master Chojey Gampopa, as evident in his work known asTreatise on the Four Dharmas (Tib. Chos bzhi'i 'grel pa),' strongly advises thatas a preliminary [to tantric practice] one first train the mind in the stages ofthe path of the three spiritual perspectives. This refers to the trainings ofthe ordinary Mahayana.Some manuals on the Naropa Six Yogas system, such as that by the illustriousmaster Pakmo Drupa, do not contain a section elucidating the preliminarypractices. This is not because these lamas do not advocate the preliminaries,but because in their traditions the Naropa Six Yogas are given to disciples onlyafter they have completed the basic trainings. These, which they call \"thepublic teachings,\" are equivalent to the Lam Rim trainings8 [lit., the \"Stagesof the Path,\" a term referring to the general Mahayana practices as structuredby the eleventh-century Kadampa masters.]The Six Yogas' manual of [the Drikung Kargyupa lama] Yangonpa [b. 1213] is thesame in this respect, and admonishes those wishing to engage in the practice ofthis Naropa system to firstly train the mind well in the basic Mahayanameditations.Thus the Six Yogas are a well-balanced transmission for guiding trainees throughthe quintessential practices of both the sutra and tantra paths. This is one ofits great features, and we should appreciate it in this context."},{"pageContent":"THE ACTUAL STAGES OF TRAINING THE MIND IN THAT PATHHow does one train the mind in the general preliminaries, those stages of thepath that are shared by both Mahayana vehicles?Here one should follow the advice found in the oral tradition teachings of thegreat Atisha [the Indian master Atisha Dipamkara Shrijnana, b. 982, forefatherof the Kadampa school], wherein it is said that one should begin by cultivatingan effective working relationship with a qualified spiritual master, and shoulddedicate oneself to him or her by means of both thought and action. On top ofthat one cultivates awareness of both the worth and the rarity of the precioushuman rebirth, and generates the firm aspiration to extract the essence of it bymeans of training the mind accordingly.'In that entering into the Great Way is the supreme method of extracting thisessence, and as the door by which one enters into the Great Way is that ofgiving birth to the bodhimind (Skt. bodhichitta)- the supreme bodhisattvaaspiration to achieve highest enlightenment as a means of benefiting oneself andall others-one should give birth within one's mindstream to a pure experience ofthis universalist perspective. When a pure experience of the bodhimind has beeninduced, this signifies that indeed one has entered into the Great Way.However, should that level of experience be mere words, then one's status as apractitioner of the Great Way is reduced to mere words. Therefore those withintelligence strive to eliminate the conditions that obstruct the birth of thebodhimind, and to cultivate an authentic experience of it.In the beginning one must turn the mind away from grasping at the ephemeralthings of this life. Not to do so only encourages obstruction to the spiritualpath, be it of the Hinayana or Mahayana. Hence one should begin by cultivatingmindfulness of how this life does not last for long, how death is always closeat hand, and how after death one may have to wander in the lower realms ofsamsara if the mind is not purified and trained in wisdom. In this way one turnsthe mind from grasping at the things of this ephemeral life.Next one contemplates well the nature of the samsaric mind and the limitationsof even the highest samsaric pleasures. This turns the mind from grasping atworldly glory and instead points it toward spiritual liberation.Then, in order to turn the mind from attachment to the individual peace and joyinduced through spiritual practice, one cultivates the meditations uponkindness, love, compassion, and the bodhisattva spirit characterized byuniversal caring. In this way one gives birth to an authentic experience of thebodhimind. One complements this with a knowledge of the ways of thebodhisattvas, and generates the aspiration to train in them.Next, when one has confidence that one is able to carry the load of thebodhisattva ways, one takes the bodhisattva oath and adopts the generaltrainings in the six perfections [i.e., generosity, discipline, tolerance,joyous energy, meditative absorption and wisdom]. In particular, one cultivatesboth tranquil sitting (Skt. shamatha), which makes the mind more powerful and isin the nature of meditative absorption; and also cultivates special insightmeditation (Skt. vipasyana), which perceives how all phenomena are likeillusions and are spacelike, a contemplative experience that is in the nature ofthe perfection of wisdom.\"After this, if one feels one is able to carry the responsibility of thecommitments and precepts of the tantric path, one studies the text of The FiftyVerses on the Guru (Skt. Guru panchashika karika)\" in order to understand how tocultivate correctly a relationship with a tantric master, and [applying thoseguidelines to one's relationship with one's own teacher] should enter intotantric practice.If before entering into tantric practice one does not train in the preliminariesof the basic Mahayana as explained above, then one will not be able to cut offclinging to the ephemeral things of this life, and as a consequence will notexperience a stable aspiration to engage in spiritual practice. Consequentlyone's spiritual dedication to practice will not pass beyond mere words, and theinspiration one extracts from the Three Jewels will not deeply affect one'smind. This in turn will mean that one will not experience a stable awareness ofthe nature of karmic cause and effect, and hence will not be inspired tomaintain any of the spiritual disciplines that one has adopted.One's practice consequently will remain superficial. One becomes unable toarouse the experience of release from samsaric addictions, and thus interest inspiritual liberation fades to intellectualization. One is unable to generate anauthentic experience of the aspirational bodhimind, which is characterized bylove and compassion, and consequently one's status as a Mahayanist exists inname only. An authentic aspiration to cultivate the bodhisattva ways does notarise, and hence one does not experience a solid commitment to cultivate theresolve of the engaged bodhimind. One's practice of tranquil sitting and specialinsight do not develop well, and one's meditative absorption lacks focus.Consequently one is unable to arouse insight into the vision of the non-selfnature.Those who want to avoid these dangers should, as a preliminary to the Six Yogasof Naropa, train the mind well in these basic Mahayana themes, the practicescommon to both Mahayana vehicles [i.e., shared by both the Sutrayana andVajrayana].The mighty Atisha, who united three lineages-that coming from Maitreya to Asanga[b. fourth c.], known as the \"vast bodhisattva ways' transmission\"; that comingfrom Manjushri to Nagarjuna [b. second c.], known as \"the wisdom viewtransmission\"; and that descending from Shantideva [b. seventh c], known as \"thetransmission for exchanging self-awareness for universal awareness\"stated thatthese are the preliminaries to be cultivated by anyone entering into theMahayana by the door of either the Paramitayana or Vajrayana.Venerable Milarepa [b. 1040] put it as follows:If one does not contemplate the nature of karmic lawHow good and negative deedsproduce according resultsThe subtle power of the ripening nature of activity Maybring a rebirth of unbearable suffering. Cultivate mindfulness of action and itsresult.If one does not observe the faults of sensual indulgence And from within oneselfreverse grasping at it, One will not become freed from the prison of samsara.Cultivate the mind that sees all as an illusion And apply an antidote to thesource of suffering.If one is unable to show kindness to every living being Of the six realms, whoonce was one's own kind parent, One falls into the limitations of a narrow way.Therefore cultivate the universal bodhimind, That looks on all beings with greatconcern and caring.And also, elsewhere Milarepa said,I experienced fear at the thought of the eight bondages And meditated on theshortcomings of impermanent samsara. Thus I settled my mind on the objects ofspiritual refuge And learned to observe the laws of karmic cause and effect.I trained my spirit in method, which is the bodhimind, And cut off the stream ofnegative instincts and obscurations. I learned to see whatever appears as mereillusions, And thus no longer need fear the lower realms of misery.Therefore, as said here, one should meditate upon these general preliminarypractices until a firm inner stability has been achieved.Gain a panoramic understanding of the complete body of the path toenlightenment, and then practice accordingly. The basis of the undertakingshould be a cultivated understanding of the complete body of the path to betraversed. Then the results are extraordinary.I have written extensively elsewhere on the practices of the general preliminarytrainings, the shared path, so will not say more here.'"},{"pageContent":"THE PRELIMINARIES THAT BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO THEHIGHEST YOGA TANTRA TRADITIONThese are of two types: the general Vajrayana preliminaries; and thepreliminaries emphasized in this Naropa system.THE GENERAL VAJRAYANA PRELIMINARIESThe first of these-the general Vajrayana preliminaries-will be taught under twoheadings: showing why it is necessary to receive the complete empowerments (Skt.abhisheka); and showing why it is necessary to observe the tantric precepts(Skt. samaya).WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO RECEIVE THE COMPLETE EMPOWERMENTSIn the traditions of the principal lineage holders of the tantric systems comingfrom Lama Marpa, including those of Lama Meton and Lama Ngokton, it is said thatone should receive the four tantric initiations as a preliminary to meditatingupon the two stages of the Secret Mantra Path.When Venerable Milarepa first met his disciple Chojey Gampopa, the former askedthe latter, \"Have you received the tantric initiations?\" Gampopa replied, \"Ihave received them from Maryul Loden, a disciple of Zangkar.\" Milarepa thereforeaccepted to teach him.13On another occasion, before Milarepa gave Gampopa an oral transmission teaching,he sent him to receive empowerments from Ban Lotsawa.Moreover, it was the practice of the illustrious Pakmo Drupa to insist that hisdisciples receive the four complete empowerments before entering into tantricpractice.All great masters of the Marpa tradition holding the oral instruction andtantric scripture transmissions unanimously agree on this. Hence it is certainthat we must receive the four complete tantric initiations.The same thing is strongly stated in the original tantric treatises [translatedinto Tibetan from Sanskrit]. For example, in section two of The Mark of theGreat Seal (Skt. Mahamudra tilika) we read,When should trainees be given instruction? Only after they have received theempowerments, For at that time they become appropriate vessels To receive thetantric teachings. Without empowerment there will be no attainment, Just as oildoes not come from pressing sand.Should a teacher out of pride in his scriptural knowledge Teach the secrettantric methods To someone who has not received the tantric empowerments, Bothteacher and disciple immediately after death Certainly will fall into the hells,Even if some siddhi had been gained. Therefore all who strive on the tantric wayShould firstly acquire the essential empowerments.Also it is said in chapter two of The Diamond Rosary Tantra (Skt. Vajramalatantra),Empowerment is of primary importance; All the attainments rest constantly withinit. I will explain the significance of empowerment; You should listen well towhat is said.If in the beginning the trainees Are given the complete empowerments, Theybecome complete vessels at that time For practicing the completion stage yogas.However, if while lacking the tantric empowerments A practitioner learns themeaning of tantra, Both guru and disciple equally Will end up in the hells.As clearly stated in the above scriptures, becoming an appropriate vessel forlistening to or meditating upon the Secret Path relies upon receiving theaccording empowerments. Therefore the empowerments are called \"the root of allsiddhis.\" Without the empowerments it is impossible to achieve any of thespecial siddhis, no matter how much teaching is understood or practiceundertaken.Not only is there the fault that profound accomplishment is impossible withoutfirst having received the empowerments, in addition, even if one does gain somesmall siddhi, nonetheless both master and disciple will fall into the hellrealms.On the topic of the empowerments The Root Tan tra of Chakrasamvara (Skt.Chakrasamvara mula tantra) states,If a mantra practitioner, without having been introduced into the mandala,Attempts to practice the tantric yogas, It will be like punching at the emptysky, Or like drinking the water of a mirage.Thus as a preliminary to tantric practice one should be introduced into themandala, should observe the mandala, and should be given the empowerments, suchas the water initiation, crown initiation, and so forth.14Otherwise, if one has the basis of having previously received empowerment intosome other mandala [than the one appropriate to the specific practice beingundertaken], then it is acceptable to receive only selected portions of therelated empowerment, or to receive a blessing initiation.\" However, if you havenot previously received a complete empowerment, then a simple blessinginitiation will not adequately serve the purpose. This is stated in the originaltantric scriptures; it was taught by the Indian panditas and mahasiddhas; and itis the advice of the Tibetan lineage lamas.Moreover, it is best if here the empowerment is into a mandala from either theHevajra or Chakrasamvara cycles. These two have a special connection [with theSix Yogas system].16"},{"pageContent":"WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO OBSERVE THE TANTRIC PRECEPTSAt the time of receiving tantric empowerment one pledges to cultivate theprecepts and commitments of tantric practice. This is done in the presence ofthe initiation master, as well as [the visualized assembly] of gurus, buddhasand bodhisattvas. One should observe these guidelines, and practice accordingly.As is said in The Root Tan tra of Chakrasamvara,The practitioner engaged in intense tantric training Should constantly maintainthe tantric precepts. If the precepts become weakened, No siddhi is achievedfrom initiation into the mandala.Also, The Tantra of Interpenetrating Union (Skt. Shri samayoga tantra) states,Not to have been introduced into the mandala, To ignore the tantric precepts,And not to have understood the essence of secrets: To practice on that basisproduces no attainment.As said above, no matter how long or how intensely one practices the tantricyogas, the desired effects will not arise if one has not first received theappropriate empowerments into the mandala; or if one abandons the tantricprecepts that are to be maintained; or if one does not thoroughly understand thekey points in the two stages of tantric practice.Those who claim to be practitioners of highest yoga tantra, yet do not even knowthe number of root and branch precepts, will gain no results. It is important togain a clear understanding of the root and branch precepts, and to guard themwell.\""},{"pageContent":"THE PRELIMINARIES EMPHASIZED IN THIS NAROPA SYSTEMThe supreme preliminary preparation involves training the mind in the basicpractices [as explained earlier], receiving the pure tantric empowerments, andthen correctly guarding the root and branch tantric precepts. One should beclear on this.In general, the exclusively tantric preliminaries as found in most traditionsinclude the practices of guru yoga, the Vajrasattva mantra recitation andmeditation, the offering of the mandala, and so forth.However, in the teachings of the lineage masters of the Six Yogas tradition, twoof the above are separately explained: the meditation and mantra recitation ofVajrasattva, undertaken in order to purify the mind of negative karmic seeds andobscurations; and the devotional meditations of guru yoga, undertaken in orderto establish strong waves of blessing power on the mind.[Translator's note: I have placed Tsongkhapa's treatment of the Vajrasattvameditation in Appendix I and his treatment of the Guru Yoga meditation inAppendix II. Readers who want to follow the text of A Book of Three Inspirationsin its original order can do so by turning here to those appendices. However, Irecommend that the non-specialist first work through Tsongkhapa's treatment ofthe Six Yogas themselves, and then read these appendices.]\""},{"pageContent":"HAVING ESTABLISHED THE PRELIMINARIES,HOW TO TRAIN IN THE ACTUAL TANTRICMEDITATIONSThis involves two subjects: the meditations of the generation stage yogas; andthe meditations of the completion stage yogas.THE MEDITATIONS OF THE GENERATION STAGE YOGASAs for the first of these, the meditations on the generation stage yogas, someTibetan traditions propound the erroneous view that the generation stage yogasare only necessary for the accomplishment of the worldly siddhis [such asmeditative concentration, paranormal psychic abilities, magical powers, etc.],and are not needed for accomplishing the supreme siddhi [i.e., the experience ofenlightenment wisdom].However, in three of the [four] principal lineages coming from Lama Marpa-theMey lineage (Tib. Mes lugs), the Tsur lineage (T\"ib. mTshur lugs), and the Ngoklineage (Tib. rNgog lugs)-the instruction of the generation stage yogas wasalways given before the instruction of the completion stage yogas.19This was also the case with [the fourth principal lineage from Marpa, that of]the Venerable Milarepa. As he himself put it,In order to train the mind in skillful perception Of the events that occur inthe bardo between birth and death, One should apply oneself to both thegeneration and completion stage yogas.Many other great masters of the past have similarly taught the necessity formeditating upon both the generation and completion stage yogas, pointing outthat not to become proficient in the generation stage before entering into thecompletion stage yogas contradicts the advice of both the original tantricscriptures [taught by Buddha] and the later authoritative Indian treatises. Italso contradicts this tradition [i.e., the legacy of the Six Yogas of Naropa].Therefore one should definitely practice the generation stage yogas beforeentering into the completion stage practices.20 The Hevajra Tantra states,Abiding equally in the two stages of tantric practice Is the Dharma taught byBuddha Vajradhara.And also,The practitioner meditates upon [the visualized] fabrication [i.e., thegeneration stage yogas]. By meditating upon the dream-like quality of thefabrication, The fabrication goes beyond fabrication.The great [Indian] master Nagarjuna himself said,Firstly establish yourself well in the generation stage yogas And then aspire tothe completion stage yogas. This is the method taught by the Buddha. These [twoyogas] are like the steps of a ladder.Thus all the authoritative tantric scriptures teach that one should meditateupon the generation stage before taking up the completion stage yogas. The mainpurpose of the actual generation stage yogas is to prepare and ripen themindstream for the realizations and experiences that are induced through thecompletion stage yogas.21Moreover, when one achieves a firm samadhi [i.e., meditative power] on thegeneration stage [through meditation upon a complete mandala], then one can usea yoga system from [a simpler] mandala of a single pair of male and femaledeities for the completion stage training, and there will be fewer dangers.However, doing so from the beginning [i.e., using a simplified mandala from thebeginning] is not the intent of the tantric treatises.Just how should one pursue meditation on the generation stage yogas?According to the authoritative teachers and lineage masters of the tradition,the foundation of the path [of the Six Yogas of Naropa] is the practice of theinner heat yoga. In turn, the principal source of this teaching is the HevajraTantra. Therefore [the generation stage may be performed on the basis of] themandalas of any of the four families of Hevajra.'However, many of the previous masters who treasured this oral tradition [of theSix Yogas] accomplished the generation stage yogas in reliance upon the HerukaChakrasamvara mandala meditations [instead of the Hevajra mandala].For example, Gampopa relied upon the lineage of Maryul Loden, the disciple ofZangkar. This was known as \"the Chakrasamvara lineage of Zangkar.\"Also, the glorious Pakmo Drupa relied upon the Chakrasamvara transmission fromLochung (Tib. Lo chung nas brgyud pa; lit., \"the lineage from the JuniorTranslator\"), known as the Mar lineage.Moreover, the Dharma master Chojey Drikungpa relied upon the Chakrasamvaratradition of Lama Chokro, which is the lineage from Mardo (Tib. Mar do'i lugs).'All three of the above Chakrasamvara lineages are based upon the sixty-two deitymandala of Heruka Chakrasamvara known as the tradition of [the Indianmahasiddha] Luipada.Thus there are these two mandalas [Hevajra and Heruka Chakrasamvara, that havebeen used by great lineage masters of the past]. The teaching on tummo, theinner heat yoga, is common to both of them. Thus either mandala practice isappropriate [as the basis of the generation stage yoga to be used as thepreparation for the completion stage yogas]. Meditation upon the mandala of asolitary male or female deity will not have the same power of effectivelyripening the mindstream as will meditating upon the generation stage yogasassociated with a complete mandala. The mandala should be at least as completeas that of the five-deity Heruka Chakrasamvara mandala of the Ghantapadatradition (Tib. Dril bu zhabs kyi lha inga).21Adopting one of the above mandalas as the basis, one engages in the practice infour daily yogic sessions.The manner of inducing the desired experiences from the generation stage yogasis to begin by cultivating a panoramic meditative visualization free from mentalwanderings. If the principal mandala deity has many faces and arms, in thebeginning one should relax one's focus upon the details and concentrate insteadon the main face and main two arms, fixing one's attention upon thevisualization of them.Here there are two aspects to the training: radiant appearance and tantricpride.One cultivates the first of these by moving one's awareness from the topdownward, and then from the feet upward, flowing through the visualized form,and thus cultivating a rough image of the mandala deity and its attributes.Eventually one is able to sense the image as a whole. One holds the image firmlyyet gently, concentrating upon it single-pointedly. In the beginning the imagewill not come clearly, and other images will force it to fade. One simplyreturns the mind to the visualization when one notices this happening. If theimage becomes unclear, rejuvenate the visualization and continue meditating. Onepursues the training in this way, and the radiant presence of the imagegradually increases.Thus one cultivates the radiant presence of the visualized image. Thought-flowsother than the desired one gradually cease to arise, and the visualizationbecomes more radiantly present and vivid than a physical form seen by the eye.One must place the mind on that radiant presence [of the visualized mandala],without falling prey to either of the two obstacles, torpor and agitation,during the session.If in this way one succeeds in generating the visualization of the simpletwo-armed form of the mandala deity, one goes on to cultivate the visualizationof the other arms, the ornaments, and so forth, until the visualized image ofthe complete form of the mandala deity has been mastered, using the method [ofsweeping and focusing] as before. Then one goes on to cultivate thevisualization of the consort, and eventually the other mandala deities.One should continue like that until finally one arrives at a stage wherein theentire host of supported mandala deities and the supporting mandala, coarse andsubtle, can be generated in the mind in a single moment, and wherein one canmaintain that visualization single-pointedly for a protracted period of time.\"As for the training in the methods of cultivating divine pride, the point hereis to generate the strong thought that one is the very mandala deity, and torest the mind single-pointedly in that conviction. Whenever this tantricself-awareness begins to wane, rejuvenate the pride of being the mandala deityas before, and place the mind there.In the beginning this meditation is in the nature of a mental fabrication.Eventually it becomes stable, and one achieves a sense of divine tantric pridethat spontaneously pervades the conscious mind.The trainings should also be cultivated in the periods between formal meditationsittings.From the very beginning of the generation stage yogas these two aspects ofpractice-divine pride and the radiant appearance of the mandala-should becultivated as complementary. When our meditation on the supported mandaladeities and supporting mandala achieves maturity, the mere mindfulness of theradiantly present image will give rise to a wonderful sense of being in whichthe ordinary appearances of things do not arise. Thus the technique has thepower to purify from within the mind the mundane presence of the conventionalworld. Similarly, if one can generate a strong sense of unfeigned divine prideas explained earlier, this will have the power to purify from within the mindthe habit of apprehending things as mundane.One arises from formal meditation and goes about daily activities, seeing themanifestations of the world and living beings as mandala and tantric deities.This is the samadhi that transforms the world and its living beings into a mostextraordinary vision. This is what is meant by the expression, \"The generationstage yogas purify mundane appearance and apprehension.\" As is said in TheArising of Samvara Tan tra (Skt. Samvarodaya tantra),The three realms of the world Are by nature the mandala's inconceivable mansion;And all the living beings of the world Are by nature mandala deities.Also [the Indian mahasiddha] Aryadeva said, \"If you understand this world andits inhabitants as mandala and deities, then how can you, 0 mind, ever becomeconfused?\"This principle applies equally to both stages of tantric practice [generationand completion]. On [both stages in] Vajrayana practice, all that appears isbrought into the circle of the mandala; all experiences are taken asmanifestations of great ecstasy; and all thoughts are sealed as being unborn anduncreated.This is present throughout the generation stage. And although on the generationstage there is not the presence of the actual great ecstasy that is aroused onthe completion stage by means of bringing the vital energies into the centralchannel, or avadhuti, one should appreciate that when the practitioner achievesstability in the vision of himself or herself as the male and female deities insexual union, experiencing the visualization as though it were real, at thatpoint method and wisdom enter into a balanced union. Subsequent to that themantric syllable \"PEH\" (Skt. PHAT) is enounced [in the daily sadhana, orliturgical meditation] in order to prevent the bodhimind substance from exitingthe body, and various levels of great ecstasy occur. This is the ecstasy of thegeneration stage.These are the principal means by which the practice of the generation stageripens the mind for the completion stage yogas."},{"pageContent":"THE MEDITATIONS OF THE COMPLETION STAGE YOGASThis will be explained under three headings: the explanation of the nature ofthe basis; the explanation of the stages of traversing the path; and the mannerof actualizing the results.THE NATURE OF THE BASISThis involves two subjects: the nature of the mind; and the nature of the body.To convey a sense of the deeper nature of the subject of meditation, the firstof these is taught. To convey a sense of the energy centers of the body thatwill be meditated upon, the second is taught.26THE NATURE OF THE MINDHere the ultimate nature of the mind is taught first. The approach is describedin The Hevajra Tantra in Two Sections (Skt. Hevajra tantra nama), wherein weread,By nature there is no form, no perceiver, No sound, and no hearer of sound, Noaromas, and no perceivers of aromas, No taste, and no experiencer of taste, Nophysical sensations, and no experiencer of them, No mind, and no mental events.Elsewhere the same text states,The sensory powers, the objects of the senses, And likewise the sensoryconsciousnesses Are known to be the yoginis [of the mandala]. All eighteendhatus of experience are understood in this way.By nature from the very beginning they are uncreated, And likewise are not falseand not true; All phenomena are like the moon reflected in water. The yoginisappreciate things in this way.Here the five sensory realms-form, sound, scents, tastes and sensations-and alsothe five sensory powers that experience these-from the perceiver of form, etc.,to the experiencer of sensations-from the eye power to the body power-all areclassified as sensory powers. In terms of the five psychophysical aggregates(Skt. skandha), all the above belong to the skandha of form. In the context ofthe gateways of experience (Skt. ayatana), they are known as the ten gateways ofform. All of these are without any inherent, real existence.\"Mind\" includes the skandha of awareness and the ayatana of consciousness.\"Mental events\" includes [the skandhas of] feelings, distinguishing awarenessand mentative patterns.Using these as examples, the gateway of the phenomena which are objects ofexperience of the mind are shown to be non-truly existent.Similarly, in the above verse, we see the words \"no perceiver.\" This points tothe perceiver of form, hearer of sounds, and so forth. These lead to the subjectof the \"person,\" the sense of \"I.\" Thus this too is empty of true existence.In brief, all that exists, both persons and phenomena, are shown to beselflessness without an inherently real nature.As for the manner in which they lack self-nature, this is introduced by thewords [in the above verse, wherein it is said] \"by nature... not....\" Allphenomena, including persons, forms and so forth, are without a nature that isinherently real.This is the interpretation given by [the Indian] mahasiddha Padma in hiscommentary on the subject. It has the same sense as the scriptural passages thatspeak of \"by nature non-existent\" and \"without self-characteristics.\" Othersimilar expressions are \"without self-nature,\" and \"without true essence.\"\"By nature... uncreated\" implies that the situation is not such that at somepoint in the past the phenomena were without this nature of emptiness of trueexistence, and that through reason and scriptural sayings they came to have anemptiness nature. From primordial time all things have lacked true existence. Averse by Lama Marpa states,[../Images/page0129_0000.svg]Thus Lama Marpa himself states that he acquired his realization of the mahamudradoctrine principally from his training with the [Indian] mahasiddha Maitripa.27A treatise by that master [i.e., Maitripa], entitled Ten Reflections on SimpleSuchness (Skt. Tattva dashaka), [states,] \"If you wish to experience thequintessential nature of being [i.e., voidness], be aware that it is not 'withcharacteristics' and not 'without characteristics'.\"The meaning here is that if one wishes to understand the quintessential natureof being, then one should not take the approach to emptiness taught by the[Indian Buddhist] schools that speak of [emptiness] \"with characteristics\" and\"without characteristics.\"The mahasiddha Maitripa's direct disciple, the pandit Sahajavajra, explains thatin the scriptures of the Shravakas we see a discussion of \"emptiness withcharacteristics,\" as is popular with the Sautrantika school of [Indian Buddhist]thought; and \"emptiness without characteristics,\" as is popular with theVaibhashika school. Moreover, he continues, in the [Mahayana schools such as]the Vijnanavadin, we see a discussion of emptiness having \"true and falsecharacteristics,\" and in the Yogachara Madhyamaka school, the doctrine of\"conventionally true characteristics and conventionally false characteristics.\"The same text continues,One should rely upon the approach to emptiness elucidated by the greatMadhyamaka masters Arya Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Chandrakirti, and so forth, whoteach that the interdependent, co-existent nature of phenomena points to thesuchness of being. We should adopt the guidelines set forth by these threemasters.Here Acharya Nagarjuna and Aryadeva are the early forefathers of the Madhyamakaschool [of Indian Buddhism]. Many later Indian masters followed their tradition.They had many different followers [over the centuries], who explained theMadhyamaka in various ways. The master Maitripa is among them, and is said to bea follower of Chandrakirti. [Maitripa's] Ten Reflections on Simple Suchnessstates,To put it plainly, most of these gurus are merely Unadorned, mediocre teachersof the Middle View.What he means is that most teachers are not adorned with the oral traditionteachings from Chandrakirti. They are but mediocre proponents of the MiddleView, and rely upon mediocre lineages of the emptiness doctrine. In thistradition Chandrakirti represents the most quintessential expression of theemptiness doctrine [coming from Nagarjuna and Aryadeva]. One should follow theapproach [to emptiness] outlined by him.The meaning of the expression \"not true and not false\" is explained in[Nagarjuna's treatise] Sixty Stanzas on the Nature of Emptiness (Skt. Yuktishashtika),[../Images/page0131_0000.svg]One should understand the emptiness doctrine in the context of this simile. Thewise perceive that all things-persons and phenomenaarise in reliance upon theirown causes and conditions, and that based on this process we impute mentallabels upon things. The phenomena themselves have no true or inherent existencefrom their own side. They have no self-nature whatsoever.Were persons or phenomena to have a self-presence, there would be no need forthem to rely upon causes and conditions. Therefore one can be certain that eventhe smallest speck of matter has no true, inherent existence from its own side.Although all things lack even the smallest speck of true existence, nonethelessconventionally the laws of causes and conditions operate through them, andconventionally all the phenomena in samsara and nirvana seem to exist, arisingin the same manner as do illusions, dreams and a reflected image.However, phenomena are not false in the sense that the saying \"A horn on arabbit's head exists\" is false. Nor is it a matter of a superficial,conventional distortion alone, like the rope seen in the dark that is mistakenfor a snake.The view of emptiness to be understood is the reality of how all things lackeven the smallest particle of true, inherent existence.Otherwise, if one does not arrive at this meditative understanding, then themethod will not bring even liberation from cyclic existence, let alone producethe state of complete enlightenment.Therefore The Vajra Tent Tantra (Skt. Vajra panjara) states,In order to reverse the habit of grasping at an I, The buddhas have taught thedoctrine of emptiness.The meaning is that in order to reverse the trend of apprehending a self inpersons and phenomena, the buddhas have taught that one must ascertain themeaning of emptiness.As the great masters of the past have pointed out, all phenomena, whichultimately are only names and mental labels, nonetheless on the conventionallevel function validly, albeit in the nature of a distortion, an illusion, and adream. Not to appreciate this [valid conventional nature of things] is a greatmistake, and is an unhealthy philosophical excess. If one takes the theory ofemptiness too far, one easily falls over the precipice of nihilism. Thus it iscrucial to appreciate how, on the conventional level, things operate accordingto the principles of illusion-like interdependent arising.\"That one should understand the nature of the two levels of truthultimate andconventional-in this way was expressed as follows by Milarepa, that great yogiand master of this path, in the following song:[../Images/page0132_0000.svg][../Images/page0132_0001.svg][../Images/page0132_0002.svg][../Images/page0132_0003.svg]Thus from the perspective of the ultimate level of reality it is said that notthe smallest particle of anything in samsara or nirvana has even the slightesttrace of true existence. However, elsewhere Milarepa said,[../Images/page0132_0004.svg][../Images/page0132_0005.svg] [../Images/page0133_0000.svg][../Images/page0133_0001.svg]Thus from the perspective of ultimate reality even the names of the phenomena insamsara do not exist. Yet conventionally, so that the living beings can traversethe path to buddhahood, the conventional level of reality [such as cause andeffect, etc.] is spoken of as existing. However, its status is conventionallyestablished solely on the basis of imputed names and labels. In reality theseinterdependent manifestations of appearing phenomena are emptiness lacking anyinherent existence.These two levels of truth-the conventional reality of functioning occurrencesand the ultimate reality of emptiness-abide always in one taste. The manifestand the emptiness natures are never separable from one another. The ultimatelevel points to and supports the conventional; and the conventional points toand supports the ultimate.This manner in which the presence of every phenomenon simultaneously revealsboth ultimate and conventional levels of reality is a key point of the mastersof this tradition [of the Naropa Six Yogas]. In the process of ascertaining themiddle view it advises that we follow the guidelines of the great Madhyamakatreatises.One should not think that in this tradition [i.e., the Six Yogas transmission]we don't have to speak in terms of the two levels of truth. To do otherwise isto contradict the Buddha's own teachings, as well as the treatises of the earlyIndian masters. It also contradicts the tradition of the Six Yogas.To arrive at the correct understanding of \"the union of ecstasy and void\" oneshould apply oneself to gaining an understanding of emptiness as outlined above[i.e., one should follow the guidelines as presented by Nagarjuna, Aryadeva andChandrakirti]."},{"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODYThis introduces the subjects of the \"energy channel wheels\" (Skt. chakra), suchas \"the chakra of emanation at the navel\"; the upper and lower regions of thecentral energy channel (Skt. avadhuti; Tib. rtsa dbu ma) that are to bestimulated through application of the profound tantric technology; and so forth.21According to the holders of the oral tradition of the Marpa lineage, thesetantric yogas are to be practiced during both the sleeping and waking states.With the first of these [i.e., when working with the sleep state], one shouldunderstand the key points of stimulating the chakras at the heart and throat.Then during the waking state one works with the chakras at the navel and crown,the former in connection with the inner heat yoga, and the latter in connectionwith the yoga of sexual union with a karmamudra. This is because on thoseoccasions the subtle drops (Skt. bindu) that support consciousness abide withinthose four sites. The tradition [of the Six Yogas] speaks in this way.This subject is also discussed in the system of the Kalachakra Tantra, whereinit is said that the chakras at the forehead and navel are associated with thewaking state; the chakras at the throat and secret place are associated with thedream state; the chakras at the heart and jewel are associated with deep sleep;and the chakras at the navel and tip of the secret place are associated with thestate of the fourth occasion [i.e., sexual ecstasy]. Thus the presentations ofthe two systems are similar in this way.When one enters into sleep, the subtle energies collect into the chakras at theheart and jewel. As long as they remain there, one experiences a deep, dreamlesssleep. Should they begin to dissipate from these two chakras and collect intothe chakras at the throat and secret place, one will begin to experience dreams.One will continue to dream for as long as the energies remain in these twochakras. When the energies leave these sites and move to the chakras at theforehead and navel one awakens from sleep altogether.When the bodhimind substance descends from the forehead chakra and comes to thechakras at the navel and tip of the jewel, it induces an experience oftransformative bliss as it passes through each of the chakras. This is theexperience of the fourth occasion [i.e., ecstasy]. This can be induced by meansof training in the tantric yogas, which bring control over the subtle bodilyenergies. By means of this process of energy control the drop is brought down[from the crown chakra to] the navel chakra, giving rise to the \"descending fromabove\" innate bliss; and, for a more profound and complete experience, the dropis brought to the chakra at the tip of the jewel.The fact that these four chakras are stimulated during the states of sleep anddream does not mean that they are inaccessible during the waking state.From among the chakras, in this tradition [i.e., the Six Yogas] one begins thepractice by working with the \"wheel of emanation,\" which is the chakra at thenavel.Meditating on the individual chakras produces individual effects, and these mustbe understood in the stream of one's own experience."},{"pageContent":"THE EXPLANATION OF THE STAGES OF TRAVERSING THE PATHThis is taught under two headings: the meditations upon the physical exercises,together with the meditation upon the body as an empty shell; and, secondly,after that, the stages of meditating upon the actual path.THE MEDITATIONS UPON THE PHYSICAL EXERCISES, TOGETHER WITH THE MEDITATIONUPON THE BODY AS EMPTYAccording to the oral traditions of some later teachers in the Marpa lineage, atthis point in the training one establishes protection through meditation on thesyllable HUM, in conjunction with the threefold practice of collecting,absorbing and retaining [the vital energies]. [Those later teachers] alsoestablish protection by means of relying upon small wrathful [deities], and byaccumulating positive energy through the practice of guru yoga. In theirtraditions the physical exercises and meditations upon the body as an emptyshell are not used 30However, the lineage that passed from Milarepa to Gampopa did not include theformer three. It instead advocated the physical exercises and the meditationupon the body as an empty shell. Hence it seems that there are two ways ofexplaining the Six Yogas of Naropa: the system as taught by the earlier masters;and the system as taught by many later masters. This treatise will follow theformer approach.[THE MEDITATIONS UPON THE PHYSICAL EXERCISES]One begins each session of the physical exercises by chanting the verses ofrefuge, generating the universal aspiration of the bodhisattva way, and thenmeditating upon the guru as seated upon a lotus above one's head, together withoffering verses of supplication for blessings. One does these until one'smindstream is blended with them. One then visualizes oneself as the mandaladeity, male and female in sexual union. Every session should be commenced inthis way.Different traditions recommend different numbers of physical exercises, as wellas exactly how to do them. Here we will follow the instructions of gloriousPakmo Drupa.In glorious Pakmo Drupa's manual [on the Six Yogas], entitled Verses on the PathTechnology: A Supplement (Tib. Thabs lam tshigs bcad ma'i Than thabs), [it isstated]:There are six exercises for purifying the body: filling like a vase; circlinglike a wheel; hooking like a hook; showing the mudra of vajra binding, liftingupward toward the sky, and then pressing downward; straightening like an arrow,and then forcefully releasing the air in the manner of a dog heaving; and, inorder to energize the passageways and blood in the body, shaking the head andentire body and flexing the muscles. These are the six.These are the techniques famed as the \"six exercises of Naropa.\"As said above, the first is that of filling the body like a vase. One sits on acomfortable cushion, with the legs crossed comfortably. The back is set straightand the two hands placed on the knees.One draws in air through the right nostril, gazes to the left, and then releasesit through the left, exhaling slowly and gently until no more remains [in thelungs]. One then draws in air through the left nostril, gazes to the right, andgently releases it via the other nostril. Next one draws in the air through bothnostrils, gazes straight ahead, and releases it slowly through both.One repeats this cycle of three breaths two more times, thus making ninebreaths. In this way the breath is purified. Throughout the process no air is tobe allowed to pass through the mouth on either inhalation or exhalation.One now sits with the body straight and erect, and the hands formed into fistswith the thumbs inside. One breathes in slowly and deeply, while pulling the airdown to below the navel. One then swallows some saliva without making a sound,pressing down [the swallowed liquid] with the abdomen to a point just below thenavel chakra. Also, one pulls up from below [with the muscles of the pelvicfloor], retaining the air inside in this way. With awareness poised at thecenter of the navel chakra, one holds the breath for as long as one can. In thisway the body is filled [with air] like a full vase.As all the subsequent physical exercises are performed in conjunction with thisbreathing technique, it is only counted as a separate exercise for the sake ofconvenience.When one can no longer hold the air inside, one releases it slowly through thenostrils, not allowing any to escape through the mouth. Exhalation should alwaysbe done in this way, without exception.The second exercise is that of circling like a wheel. Begin by sitting in thevajra posture. Then hold the big toe of the right foot with the right hand, andthe big toe of the left foot with the left hand. One straightens the spine, andthen rolls the upper waist and stomach clockwise three times. One then rollsthem counterclockwise three times. Next one stretches the upper body from theleft to the right, and then from the right to the left. Finally one snaps thesolar plexus from the front toward the back, and then from the back toward thefront.For the third exercise, that of hooking like a hook, one forms the hands intovajra fists and then, with muscles tensed, stretches them outward, from theheart to directly in front of the chest. One then stretches the two arms to theleft, and slowly but with muscles tensed slides the right hand back to the rightshoulder. One next brings the left hand to the heart, and snaps the left elbowinto the rib cage. This is repeated three times. Now, just as was done to theleft above, one does the same in reverse. One makes the vajra fist mudra,beginning with the two hands at the heart and then extending them straightoutward slowly but with tensed muscles. One now stretches them to the right,hooks them as before [except in reverse], bringing the left hand to the leftshoulder, the right hand to the heart, and snapping the right elbow into the ribcage.The fourth exercise is that of showing the mudra of vajra binding, liftingupward toward the sky, and then pressing downward. Plant the knees flat [on thefloor], straighten the body, and then, with the fingers of both handsoutstretched upward like metal hooks, one lifts upward slowly but with greatintensity to above the crown. One then reverses the hands [to have the hookedfingers pointing downward], and brings them down slowly but with intensity.Fifthly is the exercise of making the body straight as an arrow and then[expelling the air] with the sound of a dog heaving. Kneel on the floor,straighten the body, place the hands on the floor, and put your head in between[the hands]. Slowly yet with intensity raise the head and straighten the body.Then bring the head back down to between the two hands [while keeping the armsstraight], and forcefully expel all air from the lungs, uttering the sound\"hah,\" like a dog heaving. Then stand up and shake the feet three times each.The sixth exercise is that of shaking the head and body, and flexing the joints.One pulls on the fingers of the two hands [in order to pop the joints], and thenshakes the head and body all over. Finally, massage the two hands, as thoughwashing them.While practicing these physical exercises one should retain the breath andcontrol the vital energies. The movements should be slow yet intense. The timefor practice is before eating [i.e., when the stomach is empty], or some timeafter having eaten, when the stomach has relaxed from the food. Do them untilthe body becomes totally flexible."},{"pageContent":"[THE MEDITATIONS ON THE BODY AS AN EMPTY SHELL]In the meditations on the body as an empty shell (Tib. stong ra), one commencesas before with the practice of visualizing oneself as the mandala deity. Thespecial application here is to concentrate on the body, from the tip of the headto the soles of the feet, as being utterly empty of material substance, like anempty transparent balloon filled with light. Place the mind firmly and clearlyon this image.This meditation [on the body as empty, or immaterial] and the physical exercisesshould be practiced in conjunction with one another.Here the body is to be envisioned as being entirely without substance, appearingin the mind like a rainbow in the sky. Although this practice cannot transformthe body into that nature, nonetheless it is very beneficial to visualize it inthis way and to keep the mind on that image. One immediate benefit is that theforceful meditations for controlling the vital energies and opening the subtlechannels will not cause pain from the changing energy flows or from the openingof the channels. And even if some pain does occur, these meditations on theempty-shell body will mitigate it. These are the special effects of thismeditation. The physical exercises have similar beneficial effects.There are many different versions of this meditation on the process of theempty-shell body. There are also many unauthentic versions of the practice. Whatis explained above is in accordance with the guidelines given by the gloriousPakmo Drupa and may therefore-be regarded as sufficient.These two techniques-the physical exercises, and the empty-shell body-are notmentioned in the principal tantric texts translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan.However, they are found in the writings of the oral traditions as transmitted bythe gurus of old.When we meditate on the chakras, it is sometimes difficult solely by means ofgentle preparatory methods to induce a state of samadhi having the ability tocontrol the vital energies and to open the energy channels. When these moreforceful preliminaries are done, there is less chance of undesirableside-effects occurring."},{"pageContent":"THE STAGES OF MEDITATING UPON THE ACTUAL PATHThis will be explained under two headings: the manner of structuring the path;and the stages of being guided on the path.THE MANNER OF STRUCTURING THE PATHThere are many ways of structuring this system of tantric yoga, the most commonbeing into two, three, four, six and ten branches.31Here Gampopa, classifying it in accordance with the capacities of the trainees,presented it in three ways: for those who could accomplish enlightenment in thislifetime; for those who could accomplish it in the bardo, which follows themoment of death; and for those who could accomplish it over a period of a streamof lifetimes.Elsewhere, when Gampopa classified it in accordance with the nature of the pathto be meditated upon, he gives a twofold breakdown: the general completion stageyogas, the power of which leads one across the path; and the methods andactivities of the enhancement techniques. As for the second of these, they donot appear in the traditions of those lineages of the Naropa system that dependprincipally upon the oral instruction transmissions. Almost no oral instructiontradition contains them. However, they can be found in the traditions of theexplanatory lineages coming from Lama Marpa.32Lama Marpa himself said,At the feet of the gatekeeper, the mighty Pandita Naropa, I listened to theprofound tantric teachings of the Hevajra system. There I received the preceptson blending, transference and union. In particular, I received the instructionsOn inner heat yoga and the practice of karmamudra yoga, And was introduced tothe key points of the whispered tradition.Thus Marpa in general was introduced to the secret whispered tradi- tion33on thethreefold practice of blending, transference and union. In particular, byrelying on the Hevajra Tantra teachings he learned the methods of inducing thefour blisses through both the inner practice of heat yoga and the outer practiceof karmamudra yoga. Thus he mainly mastered these two-the inner heat doctrineand karmamudra-based principally on the Hevajra Root Tantra.Elsewhere Lama Marpa said,In the west, in the town of Tulakshetra, I bowed at the feet of the gloriousJnanagarbha And listened to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, a male tantric system. ThereI received the instructions on the illusory body and clear light And trained inthe essence of the five stages of the path.As Marpa himself states here, on the one side he relied upon the transmissionknown as \"the four exalted instructions\" from the lineage of Naropa\" and also herelied upon the instructions of the \"Five Stages\" tradition of the GuhyasamajaTantra. This latter he received in separate transmissions from both Jnanagarbhaand Naropa, and thus the traditions of the illusory body yoga and clear lightyoga [in his lineage] mainly derive from the Guhyasamaja Tantra's \"Five Stages\"technology.-\"As for the yogic techniques of consciousness transference and \"forcefulprojection,\" it seems that he mainly assimilated these from The Four SeatsTantra (Skt. Shri chaturpitha tantra).The list of the Six Yogas is as follows: inner heat; illusory body; clear light;consciousness transference; forceful projection; and the bardo yoga.Here dream yoga and bardo yoga are both branches of the illusory body yoga.Moreover, \"the clear-light-of-sleep yoga\" is also subsumed under the instructionof the illusory body.The instructions on consciousness transference and on forceful projection areusually explained together, for the sake of convenience.Jetsun Milarepa described the oral transmission that he had received from Marpaas follows:The tradition of Marpa of the Southern Hills has six instructions: thegeneration stage yogas; inner heat; karmamudra; introduction to the essence ofthe view of the ultimate nature of being; the indicative clear light of thepath; and the indicative illusory nature, together with dream yoga. This is theheart-essence of Marpa's teachings. There is no higher precept for introducingthe trainee to the essence of the whispered teachings. There is no more preciousinstruction than this, the heart of that yogi's thought. No teaching is morepractical.Of these six, all but the first belong to the completion stage techniques.The traditions of the holders of the explanatory transmissions of the tantrascoming from Lama Marpa are in harmony with what is said here [by Milarepa].Therefore those who claim to hold lineages [coming from Lama Marpa] moreprofound than the Six Yogas of Naropa are only fooling themselves.In general, all systems of highest yoga tantra's completion stage involve thepreliminary process of controlling the vital energies flowing through the twoside channels, rasana and lalana, and redirecting them into the central channel,avadhuti. This is indispensable.-6There are numerous means for accomplishing this, based on the traditions of theIndian mahasiddhas, who drew from the various tantric systems. In this tradition[i.e., the Six Yogas of Naropa] the main technique is to arouse the inner heatat the navel chakra, the \"wheel of emanation,\" and then through controlling thelife energies by means of the AH-stroke mantric syllable [lit., \"the short AH],to draw the subtle life-sustaining energies into the central channel. When theseenergies enter the central channel the four blisses are induced, and onecultivates meditation on the basis of these in such a way as to give rise to theinnate wisdom of mahamudra.Otherwise, if one does not rely upon a profound path of this nature [i.e., inwhich the basis of the meditation is not the innate ecstasy conjoined withwisdom awareness], but instead engages a samadhi that merely maintains a stateof non-conceptual absorption for a prolonged period of time, no great signs ofprogress will be produced. Firm concentration placed in a state of pleasant,clear non-conceptuality is a practice common to both the Hinayana and Mahayana;and, within the Mahayana, it is common to both the Paramitayana and Mantrayana.It is important not to confuse the two types of samadhi.Thus, when Milarepa and Gampopa met for the first time and Gampopa commentedthat he could sit in meditative concentration for many days at a time withoutdistraction, Milarepa replied to him, \"You cannot get oil by crushing sand. Thepractice of samadhi is not sufficient in and of itself. You should learn mysystem of inner heat yoga, which redirects the subtle life-sustaining energiesinto the AHstroke mantric syllable.\" One should understand this point well.In this tradition the expression \"the inner heat, the foundation,\" is wellknown. This is because in the completion stage yogas one uses the inner heattechnology from the very beginning in order to collect the subtlelife-sustaining energies into the central channel, and thereby arouse the innategreat ecstasy. This is the actual basis upon which all practices rely, and uponwhich all later completion stage yogas are founded. The inner heat doctrineestablishes this basis.The practice of the inner heat doctrine entails directing the lifesustainingenergies into the central channel. Here the energies enter, abide, and aredissolved. When one trains well in this technique, the strength of theexperience has the power to give control over loss of the bodhimind substance[i.e., the sexual drops]. Then, based on this power, one can rely upon akarmamudra as a conducive condition to arouse the four blisses. On thisfoundation, innate ecstasy is aroused.Arousing this innate ecstasy is the purpose of the practices of the inner heatyoga and karmamudra yoga.One unites the innate ecstasy with [meditation upon] emptiness, and during thewaking state applies oneself to the illusory body doctrine. Based on theexperience of the illusory body practice one can engage in the clear lighttechnology.Then when asleep at night one can cultivate awareness of the illusory nature ofdreams. To do so effectively one must first master the yoga of retaining theclear light of sleep [i.e., the clear light that arises at the moment of fallingasleep], and then enter into the dream state from that perspective. Since thepower to retain the clear light of sleep is accomplished by means of gainingcontrol over the vital energies, one must, during the time of waking practice,master this control and cultivate the ability to direct the energies into thecentral channel. Thus the foundation of both practices [sleep and dream yogas]is the inner heat doctrine.When one has progressed in the dream yogas, only then can one effectively workwith the bardo yogas. Again here [with the bardo yogas] the foundation is thepower achieved through the inner heat.All three of the above yogas [i.e., sleep, dream and bardo] are subsumed underthe illusory body yoga.As for the yogas of special consciousness transference and forceful projection,as a preliminary to them one must cultivate the ability to draw thelife-sustaining energies into the central channel. Therefore in these two theinner heat yoga again is the foundation.If one understands these principles of the system well, then the manner in whichthe Six Yogas are structured is not important. One should simply adopt thearrangement that feels most comfortable."},{"pageContent":"THE STAGES OF BEING GUIDED ON THE PATHThis will be explained under two headings: the essence of the basic principlesin the guidelines of the path; and the methods and activities for enhancing thepath.THE ESSENCE OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE GUIDELINES OF THE PATHThe first of these is explained under two headings: the essence of the actualpath; and the branches of that path, which include the practices ofconsciousness transference and forceful projection.THE ESSENCE OF THE ACTUAL PATHThe first of these also has two phases: arousing the four blisses by means ofdrawing the vital energies into the central channel; and, having accomplishedthat, the meditations on the illusory body and clear light yogas.AROUSING THE FOUR BLISSES BY MEANS OF DRAWING THE VITAL ENERGIES INTO THECENTRAL CHANNELAgain, the first of these is accomplished by means of assembling two conditions:the inner condition of the meditations on the inner heat yoga; and the externalcondition of relying upon a karmamudra.THE INNER CONDITION OF MEDITATIONS ON THE INNER HEAT DOCTRINEHere there are two stages to the practice: meditating upon the inner heat yogain order to draw the vital energies into the central channel; and, havingbrought in the energies, the methods of arousing the four blisses.MEDITATING UPON THE INNER HEAT IN ORDER TO DRAW THE VITAL ENERGIES INTO THECENTRAL CHANNELThe first stage is taught under two headings: how to meditate on the inner heatyoga; and by having meditated in this way, how to cause the vital energies toenter, abide and dissolve within the central channel."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO MEDITATE ON THE INNER HEAT YOGAHere there are three principal steps in the training: meditating by means ofvisualizing the channels; meditating by means of visualizing mantric syllables;and meditating by means of engaging the vase breathing technique.MEDITATING BY MEANS OF VISUALIZING THE CHANNELSIn the first of these one begins by visualizing one's root guru in the space infront, together with the gurus in the line of transmission, surrounded by thehost of dakas and dakinis. One symbolically offers them all things withoutgrasping at any, and then follows this with prayers for blessings andrealization, making supplication that one's energies may be joyous and energychannels subtle, so that the special realizations of ecstasy and [the wisdom of]emptiness may be easily induced.One reflects, \"For the benefit of living beings as vast in number as the measureof the sky I will achieve the state of a Buddha Vajradhara. For this purpose Inow take up the practice of chandali, the inner heat yoga.\" Meditate like thisuntil your stream of being is infused with the bodhimind, the bodhisattvaaspiration.Visualizing yourself as the mandala deity, sit on your meditation seat, put onyour meditation belt, cross the legs, and set the backbone erect. The neck isbent slightly forward, and the eyes cast downward at the angle of the nose. Thetongue is held gently against the upper palate, and the teeth and lips set intheir natural [closed] position. The body and mind are postured alertly, withthe chest somewhat extended, and the hands in the meditation posture, placedjust under the navel.One now visualizes the three energy channels. Firstly the central channel,avadhuti, is envisioned. It begins at a point four fingerwidths below the navelat the center of the body just in front of the spinal column. To its right isthe channel known as rasana, and to its left is lalana. These channels proceedup the body to the head, like pillars supporting the four chakras.One imagines that the lower tips of the side channels curve up into the base ofthe central channel. This is done in order to draw the vital energies into thecentral channel. Not understanding this purpose, some teachers have said thatthe three channels just come to an end and stop at a distance four fingerwidthsbelow the navel. Others have said that the two side channels just stop there [atthe navel].[One visualizes the channels in this way for the purpose of meditation. But infact] the channels continue on down, eventually coming to the tip of the jewel.Above, the central channel comes to the point between the eyebrows, and the twoside channels come to the inner passages of the two nostrils.At the sites of the four chakras, the two side channels, rasana and lalana, wraparound the central channel, forming knots. Otherwise they [all three] runstraight [up and down the body].As for the size of the channels, this varies at times of meditating and notmeditating. There is no certain, fixed size.Moreover, as for the colors of the channels, A Harvest of Oral TraditionTeachings (Skt. Amnaya manjari) quotes The Mystic Kiss Tantra (Skt. Chaturyoginisamputa tntra) as stating that during the meditation for arousing the innerheat, the central channel should be seen as having the color of the flameproduced by burning sesame seed oil. Prior to that point in the training,however, the right channel should be seen as being red, the left white, and thecentral channel bluish.Now one visualizes the four chakras. Firstly at the navel is the chakra called\"the wheel of emanation.\" Its shape is somewhat triangular, like the [Sanskrit]syllable EH, and it has sixty-four petals. They are red in color, and stretchupward. Meditate upon it in this way. Here the arrangement of the petals is onlyroughly described. Details are not mentioned; but this is enough.At the heart is the chakra known as \"the wheel of truth.\" Its shape is somewhatcircular, like the [Sanskrit syllable] BAM, and it has eight petals, white incolor, extending downward.At the throat is the chakra known as \"the wheel of enjoyment,\" also somewhatcircular in shape, like the syllable BAM. It has sixteen petals, red in color,reaching upward.At the crown is the chakra \"the wheel of great ecstasy.\" It also is somewhattriangular, like the syllable EH, and has thirty-two petals, is multicolored,and its petals extend downward.The meditation should hold each of the [two] pairs of chakras within anaccording embrace of method and wisdom.37When one begins the training of visualizing the three energy channels there aretwo aspects of the practice to which one should attend, namely, the radiance ofthe image and the meditative placement. That is to say, one must produce acollection of two factors: the radiant appearance of the envisioned channels;and the firmness of the meditation.The most important site for the placement of one's awareness at the beginning ofpractice is the point in the region of the central channel where the threechannels join.Based on this, one proceeds to visualize the four chakras, with their accordingnumber of petals, and to fix the mind on them. With persistence in themeditation the chakra petals become increasingly clear [in one's mind], and themind more firmly placed upon them.If after considerable effort no clarity is achieved with the chakras, place themind solely on the image of the three channels. Concentrate especially on theportion above the heart chakra. If still no progress is forthcoming, prolongedapplication can incur dangerous obstacles. One therefore should relax theapplication, and place the mind instead on the point where the three channelsjoin [at the lower part of the body].In this tradition there are two approaches to the practice: first to establishstable clarity in the radiant appearance of the channels and chakras for aprolonged period of time; and not to do so. The former is the most effectiveapproach. The [Indian] mahasiddha Lawapam also gave the advice that we shouldcultivate the radiant appearance of the channels.Here if one wishes to conjoin the practice with that of retaining the breath,one should do as explained earlier [with the breath technique instruction]. It,the physical exercises, and the meditation on the body as an empty shell, can beengaged in rotation. This should also be applied to what will come later."},{"pageContent":"MEDITATING BY MEANS OF VISUALIZING THE MANTRIC SYLLABLESIn the practice of the inner heat yoga one meditates on all four chakras. Moreprecisely, one meditates upon the three energy channels, four chakras, and alsoa mantric syllable at each of the four chakras.This is the instruction given in both The Hevajra Root Tantra (Skt. Hevajra mulatntra) and The Sambhuta Explanatory Tantra (Skt. Samputa tantraraja tika), aswell as in other sources. Moreover, it is also the transmission handed down tous from many of the [Indian] mahasiddhas of old, including Krishnacharyahimself.39Generally speaking, the practice of envisioning the mantric syllables at thechakras can be done either elaborately or else simply.In the former method, one visualizes a syllable at the center of each chakra, aswell as on each of the petals. However, the oral instructions of this traditiondo not elucidate this more elaborate process. Instead, they advocate that weshould simply visualize a mantric syllable at the center of each of the fourchakras. This is also the process taught in The Sambhuta Explanatory Tantra andin the writings of many of the Indian mahasiddhas.Therefore solely to meditate on the AH-stroke mantric syllable at the navelchakra [as some teachers today recommend], or to meditate on the AH-stroke atthe navel chakra together with HAM at the forehead chakra, is not sufficient.One should also bring in meditation on the syllables at the heart and throatchakras. This is important.The manner of this meditation is as follows. One sits in the bodily posturedescribed earlier. The place where the AH-stroke mantric syllable is to bevisualized is the center of the central channel, just in front of the spinalcolumn, at the place where the channel runs through the navel chakra. One shouldonly meditate on the syllable as being at that point.The process is as follows. One observes the navel chakra, known as \"the wheel ofemanation.\" At its center one envisions the AH-stroke syllable, standing upon atiny moon cushion. It is in its Sanskrit form, which resembles the Tibetancharacter shad in the Tibetan classical script [i.e., the vertical stroke thatdivides Tibetan sentences]. It is red in color, and stands upright.As for the syllable at the heart chakra, known as \"the wheel of truth,\" whichhas eight petals, the place of this chakra is at the central channel just infront of the spine, at the point midway between the two nipples. One meditatesonly on the point at the center of the central channel. In this process ofmeditation one observes a tiny moon disk at the center of the chakra, and uponit a blue syllable HUM, its head pointing downward. One meditates that it hasthe power to cause the bodhimind substance to descend like falling snow.Next one concentrates on the chakra known as \"the wheel of enjoyment,\" which hassixteen petals. The place of this chakra is at the throat [i.e., behind theAdam's apple], and again the central channel runs through it, just in front ofthe spinal column. It is there that one places one's concentration, and observesa tiny moon disk, a tiny red syllable OM standing upright upon it.Finally one focuses upon the chakra at the crown of the head, known as \"thewheel of great ecstasy,\" which has thirty-two petals, the central channelrunning up the center of it. One observes a moon disk at its center, a whitesyllable HAM standing upon it, its head pointed downward.[../Images/img0003.jpg]Channels, chakras and mantric syllables for the inner heat yogaWith all four of these chakras it is important to remember that the centralchannel runs through the center of them, and the side channels wrap around andconstrict the central channel at the places of the chakras. It is important toconduct the meditations at the level of the knots, and to envision each mantricsyllable as being at the center of the central channel. The Sambhuta ExplanatoryTantra states,At the center of the heart is a lotus With eight petals, together with itsessence; The channel that runs through its center Has the nature of a flame froma butterlamp And resembles the flower of the water tree Opened in bloom, petalsstretched downward. Residing at its center is the hero, The size of a mustardseed, The indestructible syllable HUM, Causing the seed to fall like snow.Here the expression \"At the center, together with its essence\" refers to thecentral channel. \"Residing at its center... syllable HUM\" indicates that oneshould practice the meditation at the center of the central channel. The sameapplies to the syllables in each of the other three chakras.Although most oral transmissions [of this Six Yogas system] teach that oneshould meditate on the mantric syllables at the center of the chakras, in someit is not clearly taught that one should meditate only from within the center ofthe central channel. If this point is not emphasized and one meditates withoutdoing so, the vital energies will not be drawn into the central channel.Consequently one will miss the essential purpose of the instruction.As for the size of the mantric syllables, such as the syllable HUM [mentionedabove in the quotation], it is a standard practice to visualize them as beingthe size of a mustard seed. However, the smaller that one can envision them, andthe more clearly one can do so, the easier it becomes to draw the vital energiesinside.Although The Sambhuta Explanatory Tantra does not mention that the AH-strokesyllable [at the navel chakra] should be envisioned as having a tiny \"ley-kor\"[Tib. klad kor; i.e., sun-like circle] above it, A Harvest of Oral TraditionTeachings clearly states that it should. Likewise, the Chakrasamvara-relatedtantric text entitled The Arising of Samvara Tantra (Skt. Samvarodaya antra)informs us that all four syllables should have all three elements of thecrescent: the half moon, the drop, and the nada. They should be seen as meltingthe bodhimind substances like dewdrops flowing down. This is important forarousing the great ecstasy.If the image can be held with radiance, this will help to prevent torpor fromsetting in during meditation, and will increase the clarity of one's samadhi.The manner of holding the visualization in the mind is to do so as though one'sentire conscious being had become immersed in the tiny image. The sense shouldnot be as though we are in one place and are looking at the visualized image inanother, but rather as though the mind apprehending the image had actuallyentered into and become utterly blended with it.Whatever the state of realization induced by meditating in this way, to thatsame degree does the mind blend with the drop [of bodhimind substance]. This inturn renders the vital energies more easily gathered.When one engages in the meditations it is important that in holding the imageone does not apply either too much or too little mental effort. The former willresult in mental agitation, and the latter in mental dullness. One should avoidthese two pitfalls and hold to the image accordingly. Moreover, one shouldconcentrate on the syllables of the upper three chakras for just a short periodof time, and then dedicate most of the session to meditating on the AH-strokesyllable at the navel chakra.Should the effort of envisioning the syllables as tiny in size remain difficulteven after an extended application, then one can begin by visualizing them aslarge, and later simply reduce them in size in one's mind.Meditating like this on the inner heat yoga has the purpose of inducing the fourblisses. To effect this, first the bodhimind substance in the channels must bemelted, and together with the vital energies must be brought to the chakra atthe crown. This generates the first bliss, known simply as \"bliss.\" Thesubstances in the channels again flow, and then collect at the chakra at thethroat; the second bliss, known as \"supreme bliss,\" is aroused. Again thesubstances flow, and then collect at the chakra at the heart; the third bliss,known as \"special bliss,\" arises. Fourthly, the energies collect at the chakraat the navel; the bliss known as \"innate bliss\" is induced.It is important in each of these four chakra meditations that the mind is heldon the mantric syllable at the center of each individual chakra, which is[located at] the center of the central channel, called avadhuti, as this makesit easier to collect the vital energies [at the specific chakra being meditatedupon].At each of the four sites a unique experience of bliss is aroused, and one mustcultivate the ability to consciously recognize these in one's own experience.The bodhimind substance that resides in the upper chakra is melted and broughtto each of the four chakras, where it must be retained. If one cannot hold it inthe chakras for a prolonged period of time one will not be able to appreciatethe uniqueness of each of the four experiences of bliss. In particular, one willnot be able to discern the uniqueness of the fourth, the innate bliss.If one can achieve stability in the technique of holding the mind at the fourchakras for prolonged periods, one will be able to control the movement of thebodhimind substance for an according degree of time. This is an important key toprogress.Moreover, if one can fix the mind firmly on the syllable HAM at the crownchakra, this will cause the force of the white male substance to increase, forthis is the seat of the white bodhimind substance. Similarly, if one can fix themind firmly on the syllable at the throat chakra, which is the site where theforce of blood [i.e., red female substance] is retained and released in therasana channel, this will increase the power of the inner heat, which arises atthe navel chakra, and in turn is the force used to direct the drop. In addition,this experience will enhance one's ability to practice dream yoga [dreams beinglinked to the throat chakra]. Thirdly, holding the mind with stability on thesyllable HUM at the heart chakra, which is the supreme site from which the clearlight consciousness is generated, intensifies the strength of the clear lightconsciousness during both sleeping and waking states. Fourthly, when one retainsthe mind at the AH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra, which is the site atwhich the channel lalana will increase the retaining and releasing power of themale genetic substance, the white bodhimind substance will flow from the navelchakra and will be diffused into the entire body, which is an important key toprogress. Moreover, the navel chakra is the special site at which abides thefire of the inner heat, which is the force used to melt the bodhimind substance.It is important that we understand the process of correctly meditating uponthese chakras and the mantric syllables associated with them.As the Indian mahasiddha Lawapa advised, we should persist in the meditationuntil the mantric syllables appear with utter clarity and radiance."},{"pageContent":"MEDITATING BY MEANS OF ENGAGING THE VASE BREATHING TECHNIQUEOne begins by generally visualizing the energy channels, as was explainedpreviously, and holding the mind on that image, making the awareness firm at theplace in the central channel where the three channels meet. One then observesthe four mantric syllables at the center of the central channel [at the sites ofthe four chakras], again placing awareness firmly on the AH-stroke mantricsyllable four fingerwidths below the navel at the center of the central channel.As this is the place at which the vital energies are drawn into the centralchannel by means of mental application, placing the mind here will definitelyencourage the process of collecting the vital energies.The Arising of Samvara Tantra as well as The Sambhuta Explanatory Tantraassociated with both the Chakrasamvara and Hevajra tantric cycles recommend thatin the yoga of arousing the inner heat one should meditate on the mantricsyllable in the fourth chakra. They do not mention doing so in conjunction withuniting the vital energies by means of the vase breathing technique. The tantricwritings of the Indian mahasiddhas Krishnacharya, Lawapa and Padma are similarin this respect.Likewise, most of the important oral tradition lineages on the practice of thecompletion stage tantric yogas do not mention meditation with the vase breathingtechnique at this point. They simply state that when one meditates on the basisof fully understanding the process of mental focusing as explained earlier, thatby itself will draw the life-sustaining energies into the central channel andcause the inner fires to blaze with strength. This in turn will melt thebodhimind substance, and the experiences of the four blisses will definitelyoccur.However, many Tibetan lamas holding the oral tradition have advised that onewould do well to supplement the process of visualizing the channels, chakras andmantric syllables with the vase breathing technique. This quickens the arousalof the inner heat. Therefore it is explained here.The technique itself has four phases: drawing in the airs; filling like a vase;compressing the airs; and releasing them like an arrow. These are the fourspecial features of the vase breathing method as taught by the lamas of thepast.Some holders of oral traditions have commented in their writings that the sourceof this method is The Four Seats Tantra. There is a danger in making such claimswithout first closely scrutinizing that tantra.The vase breathing technique begins with sitting in meditation in the postureexplained earlier. As for the time for practice, the manual of glorious PakmoDrupa comments that although some lamas recommend the occasion when the breathis flowing evenly through both nostrils, in fact any time of the day or night isan appropriate time for the practice. However, when one commences the training,because breath is associated with vajra speech, i.e., the communicativeprinciple of enlightenment, an auspicious time to begin is when the vital energyknown as \"lotus protector\" is most easily caused to rise. This is stated in thecommentary to The Arising of Samvara Tantra entitled The Lotus Receptacle (Skt.Padmini).40As for how one takes in the breath, one does not do so through the mouth, butrather through the nostrils; and one does not apply force, but rather gentlydraws in a long, deep breath.In the process called \"filling the vase\" one holds the air inside, not allowingany to leave, and presses it down. One imagines that the breath enters the twoside channels-rasana and lalana-and fills them out, like an empty intestineinflated with air. Both side channels are envisioned as becoming filled in thisway.The process of compressing the air is as follows. After the side channels havebecome filled one meditates that the air from both of them flows into thecentral channel. One swallows without making any sound and retains the air inthis way, while pressing down with the abdomen. Simultaneously from below onedraws in air gently from the two lower apertures [i.e., anus and sexual passage]to the site of the AH-stroke mantric syllable. Meditating in this way, hold theair inside for as long as possible.Here the verse commentary of glorious Pakmo Drupa recommends that one meditateon the air as flowing from the two side channels, rasana and lalana, into thecentral channel. This is the application of \"filling.\" Retain the air ifpossible. If not possible, then after the period of a cycle of finger snaps onereleases the air slowly, using whatever is left inside for the dissolvingprocess. However, Pakmo Drupa's prose commentary explains the process inaccordance with what was said earlier.\"Although glorious Pakmo Drupa thus presents two quite different instructions,the only real difference occurs in one of the four phases. His instructions ondrawing in the airs, retaining them and then expelling them are the same in eachcase. As for the process of \"filling,\" the air that has been inhaled fills therasana and lalana channels; for the compressing, the air in these two channelsis envisioned as flowing into the central channel. The air in the side channelsis compressed, forcing it to flow into and fill the central channel.42With this meditation on the vase breathing technique at the navel chakra, someteachers state that one should not draw up the airs from below, but shouldsolely press down from above [with the abdomen]. Others say that one firstpresses down from above for some time, and then afterwards draws up from belowthree times.These theories fail to appreciate the dynamic involved in vase breathing at thenavel chakra. One of the key elements in the meditation is that one wants toredirect the life-sustaining energies flowing above the navel, and also theeliminating energies from below the navel, and blend these two.The Arising of Samvara Tantra explains it as follows,The energies that course above and below Through the mind are brought to a kiss.Thus this tantra states that the vital energies from above and below are to bebrought together in a kiss through the application. Therefore one should bothpress down the airs from above and draw them up from below. One should not do sosimultaneously, but rather first do the one and then the other. Unless there isa special reason for doing otherwise [such as a health problem], then one firstpresses down the air from above into the navel chakra, and then draws up thelower airs from below to that same site, thus pressing the two together. Onesimply does both of these applications one time each; there is no need for doingso three times each [as some recommend].The fourth phase, that of releasing like an arrow, instructs that in releasingthe breath one should do so gently and quietly, imagining that it comes up thecentral channel. However, one does not visualize it as leaving by the crownaperture [as some teachers advise].Thus the airs from above and below are drawn to the navel chakra. At this point,however, it is not appropriate to visualize that the entire body is filled withpure vital energies [as some teachers have suggested], nor that solely the heartand throat chakras of the upper regions are filled [as others have suggested].Instead one concentrates upon the AH-stroke mantric syllable [at the navelchakra], and at that place of meditation brings the upper and lower airs into akiss. This is a supreme key.In fact we need to possess two keys: that for bringing together thelife-sustaining energies, which have been drawn into the central channel, andthe eliminating [or, alternatively, the downward-moving] energies, into a kissat that place [i.e., at the site of the mantric syllable at the center of thecentral channel, at the location of the navel chakra]; and, secondly, we needthe radiant clarity of the appearance of the tiny mantric syllable, as wasmeditated upon previously.Here it is said that when the side channels rasana and lalana have their lowerapertures open, that of the central channel will remain closed. Conversely, whenthat of the central channel is opened, those of the side channels will remainclosed.One visualizes that through the vase breathing meditation the flow of the vitalenergies of the side channels is prevented from escaping, and instead isredirected into the central channel. The meditation has these two aspects. Whenthe technique has reached maturity one gains the power to actually draw theenergies into the central channel.As for how to retain the airs, and the duration of the sessions, here theinstruction of glorious Pakmo Drupa states,At first concentrate on cleaning the energy channel system, and try not to forcethe energies. Press the airs [while holding the breath] just so long as a senseof forcing is absent, applying just the appropriate intensity.As said here, until some progress has been made one should apply gentleness inthe method [of breath retention and the according meditation on bringing theupper and lower energies together at the navel chakra]. Do not force the upperpart of the body, and do not draw up from below too forcefully.The duration of the sessions should not be such that sensations of discomfortcome to dominate the experience. To force things will not induce the energies toenter into the central channel. Even should it cause the energies to enter thenavel chakra for a moment, they will not remain there, and will leave. Moreover,although retaining the energies outside the chakra may produce some heat andecstasy, such as the ability to raise the body temperature, or sensations ofbliss, this will not help to bring the vital energies into the central channel.For example, when one first takes up the practice of meditation one can onlyhold the mind on its object for a moment, and then it slips away. It does notabide by its own inclination. Only when one has arrived at a particular level inthe training will it remain of its own impetus. Similarly, although the energiesmay occasionally enter the navel chakra through forceful practice, theirinclination is to flow and not to remain, and thus one will not be able toretain them. They will not naturally remain; and if one attempts to force them,they cannot be retained at the desired place. Dangerous obstacles can beincurred, and not the slightest desirable effect achieved.When the energies begin naturally to remain, then one can extend the duration ofthe application. Carefully and skillfully observing the process will bring theability to know if the energies will naturally remain or not, and if they can beretained at the desired place.The time for practicing the vase breathing technique is on an empty stomach, orwhen the food is well digested. Meditate in sessions that are not too long induration, taking occasional rests. Do not do so for long sessions without takinga break.When skill in the vase breathing technique is stabilized, one engages in thetechnique in conjunction with visualizing the four mantric syllables at thecenter of the chakras at the navel, heart, throat and crown. The syllables areat the center of the central channel, the side channels coiled around it [atthese locations], the apertures as described earlier. One clearly visualizes themantric syllables AM, HUM, OM and HAM in this way.Then the energies residing in the chakra at the secret place cause the AH-strokesyllable at the navel chakra, which is in nature the inner fire, to blaze withlight. This light rises up the central channel avadhuti and melts the otherthree syllables, HAM, OM and HUM [respectively at the crown, throat and heartchakras]. These melt and fall into the syllable AM [at the navel chakra].41 Thefour become of one inseparable nature. One then fixes the mind on the drop[formed by this fusion], the nature of which is the innate ecstasy. If one cando so, then from the drop comes the tongue of a tiny flame of the inner heat.One fixes the mind on it.Light from this flame rises up the central channel, where it melts the drop ofwhite bodhimind substance abiding within the crown chakra. This drips down likenectar, filling the AM-stroke mantric syllable at the navel chakra. Onemeditates single-pointedly on the AM-stroke, until the signs of stability arise.When meditative stability has been achieved then the radiance of the light fromthe inner fire will illuminate the inside and outside of one's body, as well asone's dwelling place and so forth, rendering them as transparent as a piece ofkyurura fruit held in the hand.It is important to meditate like that, keeping the mind on the tiny flame. Doingso is said to render one's samadhi more subtle, and to encourage quick and easyfulfillment of one's meditative power."},{"pageContent":"HAVING MEDITATED IN THIS WAY, HOW TO CAUSE THE VITAL ENERGIES TO ENTER,ABIDE, AND DISSOLVE WITHIN THE CENTRAL CHANNELBy means of the three previous meditations, one arrives at the threshold whereinone can successfully apply the technology for causing the vital energies toenter into the central channel.What are the unmistaken signs that occur? This is an important question.Numerous signs are mentioned in various traditions, but many of these seem to besuperficial. The convincing signs are as follows.After completing a session, one checks to discern the nostril through which theairs are mainly passing. One then engages in the bodily posture and mentalapplication.After some time of applying the practice, one observes the nostrils, and drawsin several breaths in order to see how evenly the breath is flowing through thetwo nostrils. Should it naturally flow evenly in both without any force beingexerted from one's side, this is a sign that the strength of the yoga hastransported one to the stage wherein the energies can be drawn into the centralchannel. However, if this sign only happens once or twice, it is not verycertain.The best sign is that, if there is no other obstruction, the airs flow throughboth nostrils, and the two flows are of equal strength, without one being strongand the other weak. This can be regarded as a sign that one has reached thestage at which the energies have begun to enter the central channel. However, itis not the case that, once it has entered, the flow of breath will not alternatebetween the nostrils. That is the entering. As for the process of causing it toremain, one meditates with great strength, and the breath becomes weak. At theend one observes carefully; the breath becomes increasingly subtle, andeventually stops altogether. Concerning this experience Jetsun Milarepa stated,When the energies in rasana and lalana Enter into the central channel avadhuti,Ecstasy [is experienced].And also,When the breath no longer comes and goes, ecstasy; When one completely cuts offthe flow, ecstasy.After stopping the flow there are two possible situations: in the first of thesethe process of dissolving the energies is easy, and in the second it is moredifficult. If it is difficult, then for a moment one feels as though one'sstomach is filled with air, but the sensation soon ceases. Then there is asensation of heat from the residences of the inner fire in the navel and secretchakras. This induces melting [of the substances], and an according experienceof ecstasy.However, this stopping of the subtle breath may occur without one havingactually dispelled subtle meditative torpor. Someone with this obstacle canaccomplish stoppage of the breath.Without having the skill of focusing at the center of the navel chakra, merelydoing the vase breathing technique will not cause the energies to remain, andthey will dissipate to other sites. Such a situation can happen; there is noflow of breath, but also no retention of the energies in the chakra. There isneither entering nor dissolving. One must understand these distinctions in thetraining.As for the duration of time that the air/energies should be retained by the vasepractice, here The Arising of Samvara Tantra states,By practicing the vase breathing as instructed, One sits with legs crossed inthe vajra posture, With the hand rubs thrice, And then snaps the fingers sixtimes. Until the breath can be retained For thirty-six cycles of thismeasurement, Persist in practice of the vase breathing technique. Those who cando three times thirty-six Are able to retain the airs for more than 108 cycles.In accordance with what is recommended above, one places one's right palm on theleft, strokes three times, and then snaps the fingers six times. The bestpractitioner can repeat 108 cycles of this measurement; the intermediate canrepeat seventy-two; and the smallest can repeat it thirty-six times whileholding the breath. All three of these [have reached the stage at which they]are able to triumph over death.'"},{"pageContent":"HAVING BROUGHT IN THE ENERGIES, THE METHODS OF AROUSING THE FOUR BLISSESThis is explained under three headings: the nature of the signs that arise,together with the blazing of the inner fire; the manner of generating the fourblisses by means of melting the bodhimind substances; and the manner ofmeditating upon the innate wisdom.THE NATURE OF THE SIGNS THAT ARISE, AND THE BLAZING OF THE INNER FIREOne places the mind at the center of the navel chakra and brings thelife-sustaining energies into the central channel. This gives rise to the signs.The manner in which the signs arise is described by the [Indian] mahasiddhaLawapa,The first sign is like a mirage, The second like a wisp of smoke, The third likethe flickering of fireflies, The fourth like a glowing butterlamp, And the fiftha formless sign Resembling a sky free of clouds.The first of the signs is like a mirage, or like a hallucination or illusoryappearance. The next four signs are increasingly clear. They resemblerespectively a mirage, smoke, and so forth.These days there are three popular interpretations of these signs. Some peoplesay that they do not literally appear as described. Others say that theexperience is merely a reflection of the stability or wavering of the mind thatperceives them; and still others state that the signs, such as smoke and soforth, do actually appear as described. This last is best.Actually, there will be a variation in the force with which the energies collectat different times, as well as in the depth of the experience, the stability orlack of it, and so forth. Hence there is no single way of describing thevisions. For example, one must make a difference between the experience of thesigns such as smoke and so forth as apprehended by someone who has applied thespecial techniques for bringing the energies into the central channel and thenheld the awareness there, and as apprehended by someone who has not done this,but rather has generated the signs merely by strenuous application of holdingawareness of non-thought.In the former of these two cases, an important phase of the practice is that ofarresting the energy of the earth element. It is said that three signs manifestwhen it has become somewhat redirected. Likewise, the energies that flow outsidethrough the doors of the sensory powers must be arrested and redirected;different signs appear when this process is initiated, when it has becomesomewhat established, and when these energies have been somewhat redirected intothe central channel. Then there is the stoppage of the energy flow associatedwith the attainment of a higher plane, and the stages of special signs thatoccur with the mere stoppage of energies.When the signs arise due to the dissolutions and the process of bringing theenergies into the central channel, then all five, from the mirage to the skywithout clouds, will occur without interruption. The earth energies dissolveinto those of water, and the mirage-like sign is beheld; the water energiesdissolve into those of fire, and there is the sign of smoke; the fire energiesdissolve into those of wind, and the sign of sparks, like flickering fireflies,appears. Then the energy that carries conceptual thought dissolves into mind,and there is an appearance like that of the light of a butterlamp undisturbed bywind.It is said that the strength of the experiences indicated by these signs willeventually carry one to the stage wherein the realization of mahamudra isachieved.The inner heat that can be aroused is of various types. For example, there isthe inner heat in the central channel, that is first aroused in the chakras atthe navel and secret place, and there is the inner heat that blazes andincreases outside the central channel. Secondly, there is the heat that isaroused from the depth of the body, and also the heat aroused at the surface,between the skin and flesh. Then there is the heat [that seems to pervade]narrow [areas of the body], and the heat that seems to pervade large areas, asaroused on initial stage$ of practice. Then there is the heat that rises slowly,and the heat that arises quickly. Also, there is the heat that seems thick, andthe heat that seems thin. In each of these pairs, the first is better than thesecond. The second indicates an inferior experience.Due to these differences there are also different levels of arousing theblisses. In turn, there is either the special inner heat, and there is merewarmth. Then there is the bliss induced merely by controlling the energies, andalso the bliss induced by melting the substances. One should understand thesedistinctions.When the special inner heat is ignited, the bodhimind substances willaccordingly be melted. Here no ill side-effects will occur as a result ofupsetting the balance of the elements. Conversely, in the production of a lessexalted heat one will not necessarily produce the melting of the drops. Bile andsexual craving may be increased in the body [causing an imbalance], and insteadof blissfulness one may experience sensations of unpleasant heat.If the igniting of the heat is done properly, then the white bodhimind substancewill be melted and increased. The melting and dropping of this white drop willcause the inner heat of the red bodhimind substance to grow in strength."},{"pageContent":"HOW THE BODHIMIND SUBSTANCES ARE MELTED AND THE FOUR BLISSES INDUCEDThe bodhimind substance is melted and descends [from its site in the crownchakra]. When it arrives in each of the four chakras it gives rise respectivelyto the four descending blisses.The Diamond Rosary Tantra (Skt. Vajramala tantra) explains the process asfollows,Then there is the explanation of the arising of the experiences: From the wheelof great ecstasy, the chakra at the crown, The eperience known as \"bliss\"arises; From the wheel of enjoyment, the chakra at the throat, The \"supremebliss\" is aroused; From the wheel of truth, the chakra at the heart, The\"inexpressible bliss\" occurs; And from the wheel of emanation, the chakra at thenavel, The \"innate bliss\" is induced. Thus are the four blisses experienced.As said here, the bodhimind substance leaves the crown chakra and arrives at thethroat chakra; \"bliss\" is experienced. It leaves the throat chakra and arrivesat the heart; \"the supreme bliss\" is experienced. It leaves the heart chakra andarrives at the navel; \"the special bliss\" is aroused. Finally it leaves thenavel chakra and comes to the chakra at the secret place, the tip of the jewel;the \"innate bliss\" is experienced.As for how the four blisses are experienced when the drop is brought back up thecentral channel and through the chakras, this is explained in the same text asfollows:[../Images/page0161_0000.svg]Here we can see that the process follows the pattern of the descending blisses,except in reverse. The same explanation is given in The Mark of Mahamudra (Skt.Mahamudra tilika).The four descending and rising blisses can each be distinguished into four each.These are known as \"the sixteen phases of the moon.\" When the distinction ismade on the basis of the sun, then each of the four can be subdivided intothree, making \"the twelve phases of the sun.\" The same text says,Like phases of the moon Are the sixteen drops of ecstasy. They should beunderstood as being In the nature of the sixteen vowel sounds [of the Sanskritalphabet]. From the stages of experience in the four chakras Are said to arisethe twelve phases of the sun; Thus do the teachings describe it.Here when the white bodhimind substance moves down and then up through thecentral channel and four chakras it draws red bodhimind substance with it. Thusin each of the chakras there are four elements of experience, and each of thesegives rise to a unique experience of ecstasy. These are \"the sixteen phases ofthe moon.\" Similarly, the bliss experienced in each of the four chakras can bedistinguished into three degrees of intensity, known as small, medium and great.These are \"the twelve phases of the sun.\"One must learn to distinguish these sixteen and twelve in the continuum of one'sown experience.In general it is said that the descending blisses are less strong than thosearoused by bringing the drop back up the channel through the chakras.When drawing up the bodhimind substance from below, the bliss experienced willnot become stable until the control of the chakra at the crown has been firmlyestablished. When control over the crown chakra becomes firm, then theexperience of the blisses becomes firm. The same text says,When the mind based on the vital energies flows, The bodhimind substance movesback up the channel And the drop comes to the center of the lotus. If it can bestabilized there, Then the lord of ecstasy will not leave, Just like a potwithout a hole Will not allow water in it to escape. At that time the experienceof ecstasy becomes stable, And that firmness in turn arouses the innate ecstasy.Consequently the state of inexhaustible buddhahood Shall certainly beaccomplished by that yogi.As A Harvest of Oral Tradition Teachings points out, here \"mind\" refers to thewhite drop; \"flows\" refers to the reversing process; and \"becomes stable\" refersto the crown chakra.Various oral traditions state that practice of the inner heat meditation causessensations of warmth to arise, and based on this warmth the bodhimind substancesare melted inside the channels. From the melting comes ecstasy, and from theecstasy arises a state of beyondconceptuality consciousness. However, merelythis depth of understanding does not account for the importance in general ofthe four descending and four rising-from-below blisses, nor in particular theimportance of dwelling within the innate bliss.The explanation above, which deals with the two sets of four blisses, is inaccord with what is taught in the original tantric scriptures, as well as in thetreatises written by the [Indian] mahasiddhas.In general, ecstasy may be experienced either by meditators who melt thebodhimind substance by means of the yogas described earlier, or by those whohave not meditated in this way. In both cases there will be the kindling of theinner fires at the navel and secret place chakras, and from this heat thebodhimind substances will be caused to move; but this does not necessarily meanthat the flow will be contained within the central channel.Thus some practitioners experience melting of the substances and also theblisses, even though they have not generated the ability to direct the energiesinto the central channel. This frequently occurs when using certain techniquesof meditation that focus on particular points of the body.Once the bodhimind substance begins to move one should establish firm controlover it before it arrives at the vajra jewel chakra, or it will prove verydifficult to retain. From the beginning one applies the outer and inner methodsto cause the bodhimind substance to move downward. While it is passing throughthe upper chakras, and before it arrives at the jewel chakra, one must exertstrong methods to control it. Similarly, the moment it arrives at the jewelchakra one must exert this control forcefully in order to halt its movement.Here one must take care, for if these methods are applied too vigorously thedrop may be incorrectly diffused into the bodily paths, causing any of a varietyof illnesses. A number of methods of correctly diffusing the drop have beendiscussed by various lamas. What we want here is to discern the process ofdissolving the vital energies into avadhuti, the central channel, and thusmelting the bodhimind substance, while preventing it from melting in other ways.A discussion of crucial distinctions, such as the ease or difficulty ofretaining control of the drop, often is not found [in Tibetan manuals].One must understand the principles of how much force to apply in the controllingprocess, precisely when such application is required and not required, and howto avoid incurring physical illnesses through incorrectly diffusing the dropinto the bodily paths. These are not discussed with sufficient clarity [in sometraditions of tantric practice].The main purpose behind these meditations that ignite the inner heat and meltthe bodhimind substances is to arouse the innate bliss. In this process onemelts the bodhimind substances and causes them to descend. In general, when theyarrive at the chakras below the navel, and in particular when they arrive at thejewel chakra, they must be prevented from being ejaculated, and must be held atthat site for some time. Otherwise one will not experience the authentic innatebliss. To arouse the innate bliss of the completion stage yogas one must firstdissolve and then retain the vital energies in the central channel.If the experience is based on dissolving the vital energies into the centralchannel and the melting of the bodhimind substance, then when the drop arrivesat the tip of the jewel one is able to restrain it from being ejaculated for aslong as it takes to induce the complete experience of the innate ecstasy. As thebodhimind substance gradually descends from the crown chakra it sublimates theforce of the energies. As a result, by the time it arrives at the jewel chakrait has already arrested the flow of the subtle bodily energy that causesejaculation.For some people it is difficult to withdraw the energies but easy to produce themelting. For others it is difficult to melt the substances but easy to withdrawthe energies.The inner heat practice can sometimes effect a quick melting, but unless themelting is subtle in intensity it will be difficult for one to control the drop.If control is not established when the drop moves through the upper chakras, itwill prove exceedingly difficult to initiate this control when it arrives at thelower chakras. And even if some control is established [at that late phase] itwill be difficult to correctly diffuse it, increasing the danger of physicalillnesses being created from side-effects. When the dissolving of the energiesoccurs correctly as in the process described earlier, none of these problemsarise.Sometimes in bringing the vital energies under control an accidental melting ofthe substances occurs before the dissolution of the energies has been effected,and the blisses spontaneously arise. How should one do the stopping anddiffusing?Simply try to slow down the process of melting, and without applying too muchforce in the meditation bring the drop back up to the crown chakra. Then diffusethe melting throughout the various channels and sites. Practicing in this way,one eventually will be able to control the drop even during a strong experienceof melting.Also, if a strong experience of melting suddenly occurs and one is unable to doas described above, then revert to the visualization of oneself as the mandaladeity. Sit in the vajra posture, cross the hands in front of the chest,wrathfully elevate the gaze of the two eyes, contract the toes and fingers,place the mind on the mantric syllable HAM in the crown chakra, which now isseen as standing upright [unlike in the usual visualization process], andwrathfully yet slowly recite the mantric syllable HUM twenty-one times. Meditatethat the drop thus travels back up the central channel in front of the spine,and returns to the crown chakra from whence it had descended. Then engage in asoft exercise of the vase breathing technique and also shake the body gently.Meditate that the bodhimind substances are diffused throughout the appropriatesites of the channels. Repeat this process several times."},{"pageContent":"THE MANNER OF MEDITATING UPON THE INNATE WISDOMAs explained earlier in the description of the descending process, the bodhimindsubstance is melted and arrives at the chakra at the tip of the jewel. If onecan retain it without ejaculation, the innate ecstasy will be aroused. At thattime one must engage mindfulness of the view of emptiness to be ascertained, andmust place the mind firmly there. Rest within the inseparable ecstasy and[wisdom of] emptiness. Even if you do not have a profound understanding of theemptiness doctrine, at least avoid all distractions and rest in the singularecstasy of the experience until the absorption becomes stable, mixing this withthe beyond-conceptuality consciousness.While doing this, retain the bodhimind substance in the jewel chakra for sometime. Then reverse it, bringing it backup to the crown chakra. This gives riseto the \"rising-from-below\" innate wisdom. Identify this clearly in theawareness, and then fix the mind in the sphere of ecstasy conjoined with [thewisdom of] emptiness. If this is impossible, then simply try to rest the mind inthe ecstasy and to blend this with the beyond-conceptuality consciousness.Remain in that state for as long as possible. This is the manner in which onecultivates the experience during formal meditation sessions.As for how to cultivate the training during the post-meditation periods, oneshould note that in general merely the presence of the innate ecstasy inmeditation does not mean that the realization will automatically carry over intothe post-meditation periods. The ecstasy that was experienced will notnecessarily become manifest in [perception of] the objects that appear duringeveryday activities. That by itself is not enough. During the post-meditationperiods one must consciously cultivate mindfulness of the experience of ecstasyand emptiness, and stamp all objects and events that appear and occur with theseal of this ecstasy and emptiness. This application causes a special ecstasy tobe ignited, which one should foster.Although this approach is not clearly elucidated in some of the oral traditions,it is explained in detail in the Marpa lineage as transmitted to Lama Ngokpa.Also, it is taught in several of the original tantras, including The HevajraRoot Tantra. Therefore it is important not to ignore it.Thus one practices both during meditation sessions and in the postmeditationperiods. In this way one proceeds by conjoining meditation on the inner fire,uniting the vital energies, and invoking the four blisses."},{"pageContent":"THE EXTERNAL CONDITION OF RELYING UPON A KARMAMUDRAHere both oneself and the mudra should be beings of highest capacity, and shouldhave received the pure empowerments. Both should be learned in the root andbranch guidelines of tantric practice, and have the ability to maintain themwell. Both should be skilled in the sadhana of the mandala cycle, and mature inpracticing four daily sessions of yoga.Also, they should be skilled in the sixty-four ways of sexual play as describedin The Treatise on Bliss (Skt. Kama shastra). They should be mature inmeditation upon the doctrine of emptiness; be experienced in the techniques forinducing the four blisses in general and the innate wisdom awareness inparticular; and be able to control the melted drops and prevent them fromescaping outside.Such are the characteristics required of the practitioners as described in theoriginal tantras and also in the treatises of the [Indian] mahasiddhas.45There are those, of course, who claim that all these characteristics need not bepresent, and that still the practice will be profound. They quote various oraltradition lineages as their source. I can only say that to practice on thatbasis is exceedingly unwise, and easily opens the door to the lower realms.On this point the text The Arising of Heruka Tantra (Skt. Shri heruka abhyudayatntra) clearly states,To call non-yoga a yogic Dharma, To rely on a mudra in order to cross in thatway, And to pretend that non-wisdom is wisdom Without a doubt only leads to thehell realms.Therefore as said here, those wishing to engage physically in the sexual yogasshould be qualified. To practice on any other basis presents great dangers. Oneshould understand this well.Those not qualified to take up the karmamudra practices should instead engage inprolonged meditation upon a jnanamudra [i.e., a visualized consort], such as themandala dakinis Nairatmya and Vajrayogini. When the practice achieves stabilityand the visualization arises with total presence and radiance, one can enterinto sexual union with this visualized consort and arouse the four blisses. Theinnate ecstasy emerges, and one unites this with [the wisdom of] emptiness, thusblending mindfulness of the view [of emptiness] with the great ecstasy. This isthe experience known as ecstasy and emptiness in union.If one is unable to do this, one simply relies on ecstasy and cultivates thesamadhi that rests one-pointedly within that bliss."},{"pageContent":"HAVING AROUSED THE FOUR BLISSES, HOW TO ENGAGE IN THE MEDITATIONS ON THEILLUSORY BODY AND CLEAR LIGHT DOCTRINESThis is explained under two headings: the general principles of how, in relianceupon the inner heat yoga, one meditates on the remaining stages of the path; andthe meditations of those particular paths.THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HOW, IN RELIANCE UPON THE INNER HEAT DOCTRINE, ONEMEDITATES UPON THE REMAINING STAGES OF THE PATHIn this tradition [i.e., the Six Yogas of Naropa] the teachings on how the innerheat yoga is used to bring the vital energies into the central channel are veryclear.However, the tradition is somewhat unclear on how, once the energies have beendrawn into the avadhuti channel, one engages in the meditations on the illusorybody and clear light doctrines. Although it seems quite difficult to subtlyanalyze these two yogas I would like to say something in order to give anappreciation of this extraordinary oral transmission.As was pointed out earlier, the doctrines of the illusory body and clear lightyogas are said to be based upon the Guhyasamaja Tantra, and also the oraltradition of the Guhyasamaja tantric system known as the Arya Cycle. Accordingto this latter, which is the transmission of Nagarjuna and his disciples, for aslong as the vital energies have not been drawn into the central channel andcaused to abide and dissolve, one will not be able to generate the samadhi ofthe threefold experience of \"appearance,\" \"proximity\" and \"proximate attainment\"that precedes the accomplishment of mind refinement; and it is from the state ofvital energies and consciousness that have generated the complete signs of thewisdom awareness of final mind refinement that the qualified illusory body canbe engaged.\"This is clear from what is said in the oral tradition of the Guhyasamaja Tantracoming from Lama Marpa. It is also clear in Lama Marpa's transmission of thefive completion stage yogas of the Guhyasamaja system, as embodied in the textElucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages (Skt. Pancha kramartha baskarananama); and it is clear in the oral tradition of that Five Stages transmission.Thus although the basic principles of the illusory body and clear light yogasare not clearly stated here [in the Six Yogas of Naropa transmission], it seemsthat we should understand them in the context of the Guhyasamaja Arya Cycledoctrines.Here the tradition of Lama Marpa is based on the text Elucidation of the Summaryof the Five Stages, wherein we read,First one experiences the hallucination-like sign That arises with the halo offive lights. Secondly is a moon-like sign, And thirdly a sign like that ofsunlight. Then is a sign like pre-dawn, and the attainment.And also,Arising solely from energy and mind, The illusory body becomes manifest.The first vision is like moonlight shining in a cloudless sky. This is the stagecalled \"appearance\" [mentioned above]. Next there is a vision like that ofsunlight glimmering in the sky; this is the stage of \"proximity.\" Then there isa vision of darkness, like the sky in early morning, with neither sun nor moon;this is the stage known as \"proximate attainment.\" After these three haveoccurred, the subtle energies and consciousness of the state of mind refinementgive rise to the illusory body, radiant with light.These are the principles on which the illusory body doctrine [of Lama Marpa'stradition of Guhyasamaja] is based; but we do not see them discussed in thistradition [i.e., the Six Yogas].Instead there is a discussion of an unpurified illusory body that is linked tothe practice of observing one's image reflected in a mirror as a means ofcutting off the coarse conceptual mind, such as thoughts of pleasure ordispleasure at likes and dislikes. Then there is a discussion of a purifiedillusory body, which is linked to the practice of meditating upon the illusorynature of one's own body envisioned as that of a mandala deity, which induces astate of one-tasteness that does not discriminate between likes and dislikes.Yet these two [\"purified\" and \"unpurified\" as described above] are only\"illusory bodies\" in a general sense common to both highest tantra and otherpaths. They are to be distinguished from the \"unpurified illusory body\" that isthe third stage [of the Guhyasamaja five-stage system], known as \"the hiddenessence of illusory nature\"; and the \"purified illusory body\" that is the fifthstage, also known as \"the illusory body of the stage of great unification.\" Itseems that this distinction is not even roughly made here 47The actual illusory body doctrine is exclusive to highest yoga tantra. The first\"illusory body\" described above [i.e., observing one's image in a mirror, etc.]does not even really qualify as a general-nature illusory essence [i.e., it iscommon to sutra teachings]; and the second one [i.e., meditating on the illusorynature of oneself as a mandala deity] is also found in the three lower classesof tantras [and hence is not even exclusive to highest yoga tantra].Mention is made of the practice having the effect of overcoming the concepts ofattraction and aversion, and thus equalizing them. This actually refers tobringing together innate great ecstasy with the wisdom of emptiness that cuts tothe heart of the Middle View. This is the principal meditation to be cultivatedduring formal sessions. One should understand these two factors well [i.e.,ecstasy and wisdom] and cultivate them.When one arises from meditation sessions, the force of the meditative experiencewill carry over [into the post-meditation period], causing all that appears toarise with the presence of an illusion.Actually, from the time of the first stage [i.e., the generation stage, thebeginning level of tantric training], a principal practice in the postmeditationperiods is to take all events and transport them into the mandala deityactivities. By means of this, an awareness of the illusory mandala deity and itsnon-inherent nature arises. Here that awareness manifests automatically.Some oral instruction lineages of the Guhyasamaja oral tradition coming fromLama Marpa suggest that we place an image of the mandala deity in front of amirror and gaze at it, while meditating that it is one's own image appearing asa reflection of the deity. They comment that this is an oral tradition teachingfor enhancing the radiant appearance of oneself as the mandala deity at the timeof practicing the generation stage yogas. They also quote the oral traditionfrom [Marpa's disciple] Lama Tsur, which comments that during the secretempowerment an image of Vajrasattva is reflected in a mirror and the disciplesare instructed to observe it and reflect upon the noninherent nature of theillusory form of the mandala deity. These practices, they state, are to bebrought into play here. They extract these interpretations from The Five Stageswithout knowing the exact meaning of the words of that text.I have explained these points extensively in my writings on the instructions ofthe Arya Cycle of Guhyasamaja doctrines. None of these doctrines were missingfrom the original oral tradition teachings of the Marpa transmission on theillusory body [even though they are missing from most transmissions today]. Idiscuss this issue in the text mentioned above.Moreover, although in this oral tradition we do find the doctrines of the \"greatunion\" on both levels of \"in training\" and \"beyond training,\" and also thedoctrines of the four states of appearance, proximity, proximate attainment andclear light, [it is helpful to refer to the Arya Cycle of the Guhyasamaja Tantrafor greater detail on a number of points, in particular:] the methods of firstproducing the illusory body from subtle energy and subtle consciousness; and,having produced that illusory body, how one generates the four emptinesses, suchas of appearance, proximity, etc., for the process of immersing the illusorybody in the actual clear light consciousness; how, when the actual clear lightconsciousness has been aroused, one makes the transition to the \"great union oftraining\"; and, at the end of that process, how one makes the transition to the\"great union beyond training\"; how, in reliance upon retaining the clear lightof sleep [in sleep yoga] and fortifying the ability to retain the energies inthe central channel during the waking state, one brings the energies of therasana and lalana channels into the central channel at the heart, andestablishes the clear light consciousness by the stages of the four emptinessexperiences; how, at the end of that process, one arises in the form of anillusory deity in the dream state; and so forth.Thus although the illusory body and clear light doctrines are taught, some ofthe details are missing. However, nobody seems to have noticed or questionedthis fact.[As for the doctrine of sleep yoga,] there is the method of bringing thelife-sustaining energies into the central channel, avadhuti, and retaining theclear light consciousness of sleep by means of controlling the energies.Alternatively, there is also the method of making firm the samadhi common toboth the Hinayana and Mahayana during the waking state; then when going to sleepone places the mind in that state of samadhi and continues it in sleep. This caneasily be mistaken for the tantric yoga of the clear light of sleep. Thesepoints are also not clearly discussed.Likewise, a differentiation should be made between the yoga of retainingawareness during dreams by means of controlling the vital energies, andretaining awareness in dreams merely by means of conscious resolution.As for the practice of blending with the clear light of death, there is themethod implemented on the basis of controlling the vital energies; andalternatively there is the practice of developing concentration and applyingthis to the clear light of death. There is also the method that relies onintense resolution and reinforced familiarity. Likewise, there is the doctrineof how to arise as a Sambhogakaya buddha form in the bardo, the preparations forwhich must be made during the present time.I have addressed these topics in detail in [my commentary to] the oralinstruction tradition of the Arya Cycle of Guhyasamaja teachings [and thereforewill not do so again here].If one practices the yogas of sleep and dream by means of controlling the vitalenergies, the nature of the two suggests that one begin by fostering retentionof the clear light of sleep. This can then be used as the basis of the dreamyoga. This is pointed out in several of the manuals [on dream yoga].If one is unable to bring the energies into the central channel, then during thedaytime one should cultivate the resolution [to maintain conscious awarenessduring the dream state], and thus retain consciousness during dreams in thatway. There is also the method of stabilizing concentration during the day, andthen in sleep applying that samadhi in order to retain the clear light of sleep.The above practice is termed \"cultivating the clear light of sleep,\" but in factincludes the two [sleep and dream yogas]. The structure and order of the two isvariable.During the day one engages the outer and inner methods in order to cause thevital energies to enter, abide and dissolve within the central channel, thusgenerating the experiences of the famous four blisses and four emptinesses. Whenthe innate bliss arises, one places awareness within it and engages themeditation of ecstasy and emptiness conjoined. Eventually one arises in theillusory body. After that, whatever appears in one's stream of experience issealed with the stamp of ecstasy and emptiness. One meditates that allappearances arise as the mandala and mandala deities.What is the principle behind working with the two extra chakrasthe heart chakrain the practice of the clear light of sleep yoga, and the throat chakra in dreamyoga?[In the former case] one meditates upon the heart chakra because it is to thepetals of the heart chakra that the vital energies naturally withdraw when onegoes to sleep. Working with this chakra during the waking state bringsfamiliarity with a technology that can be utilized in the sleep yogas, to beengaged when [during the process of entering into the sleep state] the subtleenergies of the rasana and lalana channels naturally begin to withdraw into thecentral channel and the heart chakra. The force of the experience of the fouremptinesses in general and the clear light emptiness in particular will beamplified. One fixes one's meditative absorption on this clear light of sleep asintensely as possible.This training naturally augments one's ability to work with the vital energiesduring the waking state, as well as generally increasing the stability of thepractice. Whether or not one has stabilized the ability to retain the clearlight of sleep determines whether the power of traversing the path will bestrong or weak.Any proficiency achieved [in the yogas of sleep and dream] will bring greatbenefits at the time of death. Practitioners who have not managed to achievesupreme enlightenment in this life can attempt to do so then [by applying whatwas learned in the sleep and dream yogas]. As the moment of death approaches,they engage the unique methods for retaining the clear light of death, based onthe degree of proficiency previously attained in the yogas of the clear light ofsleep and of arising in the illusory body of the dream state. Familiarity withthis technique causes the strength of one's illusory body practice to increaseduring the waking state, and that in turn supports one's practice of generatingthe illusory body of the dream state.Should death arrive before supreme enlightenment has been attained, and onewishes to apply the yoga for enlightenment at the time of death, then [as thedeath process sets in] one engages the yogas of controlling the vital energiesin order to recognize the clear light of the moment of death, using the sameprinciples that were applied in the yoga of retaining the clear light of sleep.In this way one enters into the bardo experience, applies the techniques learnedthrough the yoga of the illusory body of dreams, and generates the bardo body asthe illusory body of the bardo.Detailed instructions for this process [as given in the Six Yogas of Naropa] arenot found elsewhere. These two oral instructions are undeceiving and are objectsof supreme wonder and praise."},{"pageContent":"THE MANNER OF MEDITATING ON THE INDIVIDUAL PATHSNow follows the explanation of how, as discussed earlier, one should meditate atauspicious times in both the sleeping and waking states on the two principalteachings of the tantras, which are the actual illusory body and clear lightyogas. Other meditation techniques [not taught in detail in the original tantricscriptures] abound in the writings of the lineage masters of this tradition, andreference to some of these will also be made.Here there are two main topics: how to meditate on the illusory body yogas; andhow to meditate upon the clear light yogas."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO MEDITATE ON THE ILLUSORY BODY DOCTRINEThe illusory body yogas are taught under three headings: how to meditate on allappearances as illusory; how to meditate on dream illusions; and how to meditateon the illusory nature of the bardo experience.HOW TO MEDITATE ON ALL APPEARANCES AS ILLUSORYAs explained earlier, during meditation sessions one conjoins awareness of theview of profound emptiness, the ultimate nature, together with the innateecstasy. Then when one arises from the session the impact of the practice willcarry over into the post-meditation period. Here [in times of non-formal sittingmeditation] one maintains awareness of the vision of emptiness, and recollectsthe previous meditation on transforming all appearances into the mandala and itsdeities. The strength of these two applications will cause all appearances toarise as illusions, and as the supporting and supported mandalas. No additionalmeditative techniques are required.A practitioner who is unable to accomplish the above should, during meditationsessions, simply integrate with the [four] blisses produced through the tantricyogas. Then in the post-meditation periods, when the world and its inhabitantsappear with an ambiance of mundaneness, he or she should cultivate an awarenessof the empty, non-inherent nature of all phenomena.Here a standard practice is to contemplate one's image reflected in a mirror, toimagine that the reflected image is absorbed into oneself, and then to think howone's body is like a reflected image. However, this technique is really taughtfor those of small powers of practice, and is not of great significance.'One begins with the meditation on how the mundane world and its inhabitants,while empty of inherent self-nature, manifest like illusions. When this becomesstable one causes the illusory appearances of world and inhabitants to arise asthe pure supporting and supported mandalas. One contemplates how all appearingphenomena are empty of having a self-nature, yet arise and are perceived as pureillusory mandala manifestations. There is also the tradition of reflecting animage of the mandala deity in a mirror and contemplating it. The image [is seenas] dissolving into oneself, and one meditates on oneself as having an illusorydeity form. If the strength of the former meditation of this nature was madefirm, then here no great effort will be required.The tradition of The Five Stages speaks of how [during the empowerment ceremony]an image of Vajrasattva is reflected in a mirror and shown to disciples todemonstrate the nature of the illusory body. The guru first explains these twoby means of metaphors and their meanings. If the disciple does not understandthe words, then a visual image is shown. This is an extension of the generationstage visualizations, wherein a special mandala house is envisioned, variouselements gathered, an image of the mandala deity reflected in a mirror, and oneis instructed to meditate upon the reflected image. This practice is mentionedin the traditions of both Lama Marpa Lotsawa and Goe Lotsawa, and [as practicedtoday] is a blending of the two.[The same text, The Five Stages, commenting on how] all phenomena are likeillusions and like dreams, explains that the illusory nature is of two facets:the manner in which the manifest illusions point to ultimate reality, i.e., howthings exist as mere momentary conventionals, and how this conventionalexistence eliminates the syndrome of apprehending things as having trueexistence; and secondly, the manner in which, even though things are empty of aselfnature, nonetheless they appear as illusions. The application here is thelatter.In this context there are two points to consider: the appearance itself; and themanner in which things are empty of existing in the mode of their appearance. Wemust appreciate both aspects. The nature of the appearance is not like that of ahorn on a rabbit's head or the child of a barren woman [neither of whichconventionally exist]. If there is no appearance, then we cannot speak of \"emptyof existing in the nature of its appearance.\" And if this does not arise in themind, then the mind that can perceive the illusory nature of appearances willnot arise.One should understand all phenomena in the light of the simile of an illusion.For example, the illusory things created by a magician's spells, such as thehorses and elephants that he causes to magically appear, are empty of actuallybeing present [as living, breathing horses and elephants], yet still can beperceived by an audience of spectators. Their actual nature is utterly differentfrom their ostensible presence.This can be likened to the way in which we perceive the things of the world,such as persons and so forth. Although the objects of perception have foreverutterly lacked a final self-nature or objective existence, nonetheless theyindisputably appear with the nature of having real, inherent existence. Theliving beings who are perceived, such as humans and gods, and the forms, soundsand so forth that occur, are all in a state of continual transformation. Andeven though the living beings and other phenomena are without even the slightestinherent nature, nonetheless on the conventional level there are living beingswho collect karma, there are the activities of seeing and hearing, and so forth.These things function conventionally on the basis of the laws of interdependenceand causality.\"In this way conventional activity is accepted as omnipresent, and the extreme ofnihilism is avoided. Conversely, because one appreciates the emptiness nature,the extreme of realism [or reification] is avoided.This awareness of emptiness is simply an appreciation of the primordialnon-inherently abiding nature of things. It is not a mental fabrication. Nor isit a partial emptiness that [is the nature of merely some phenomena and] doesnot pervade all objects of knowledge. By placing one's awareness on this finalmode of being, all the forces that eliminate the syndrome of grasping at an \"I\"are strengthened.That profound nature [i.e., emptiness] is not an inaccessible object ofawareness. By ascertaining the pure view of emptiness and acquiring familiaritywith meditation upon that quintessential aspect of being, it arises as an objectof the mind. Thus it is not an emptiness, as some would say, that cannot beengaged at the time of practice, nor an emptiness that cannot be perceived orrealized.In brief, one examines one's person, the apprehender of an \"I,\" and asks whetherthis \"final nature\" that appears exists as either one with or separate from thebody-mind aggregates. One discovers that it does not even slightly exist ineither place. Thus the living beings are seen to utterly lack true existence.One makes one's experience of this awareness firm. This is the training on theemptiness side of things.As for the training on the conventional side, i.e., that of interdependentco-existence, here one turns the mind's awareness to how on the functional levelall things indisputably appear as existing. Living beings manifest as objects ofconventional perception, as collectors of karma, and as experiencers of theresults of karma. We should cultivate a definite realization of how, althoughhaving no self-nature, all phenomena conventionally function with validityaccording to the laws of interdependent arising.Whenever these two levels of being seem contradictory, use the simile of animage reflected in a mirror to appreciate their non-contradictory nature.Contemplate how the reflected image of a face, including the eyes and so forth,are empty of existing in the manner of their appearance. Based on the presenceof an image to be reflected, as well as the mirror and so forth, the reflectionis created. When one takes away the supporting conditions, such as either theface or the mirror, the image disappears. The two [emptiness nature andappearing nature] have a commonly shared base.Therefore there is not a single particle within living beings to represent afinal self; yet living beings collect karmic seeds, experience the results, andtake rebirths according to their previously collected karmic seeds and thepresence of the spiritual distortions within themselves. One must appreciate thenon-contradictory nature [of emptiness and relativity] in this way.When one has achieved stability in this realization one extends it to the world,which is seen as the mandala; and to living beings, who are seen as tantricdeities. Then one trains in the method of the playful view that dwells withinecstasy and emptiness conjoined.By practicing in this way, all appearances become mandala and deities. These inturn appear as illusions, and the illusions arise as great ecstasy. These arethe three stages of the process.During meditation sessions one invokes the great ecstasy, uses this as thedriving force in the focus upon the view of emptiness, and then restssingle-pointedly within that absorption of beyond-conceptuality mind. Betweensessions one cultivates the awareness of how emptiness and conventionalinterdependent existence complement one another.In this way the two [formal sessions and between-session trainings] are appliedin rotation as complementary to and supportive of one another."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO MEDITATE ON DREAM ILLUSIONSThis involves four trainings: learning to retain [conscious presence during]dreams; controlling and increasing dreams; overcoming fear and training in theillusory nature of dreams; and meditating upon the suchness of dreams."},{"pageContent":"LEARNING TO RETAIN [CONSCIOUS PRESENCE DURING] DREAMSConscious presence can be retained during dreams by either of two methods.In the first of these, which involves working with the vital energies, onegathers the vital energies into the central channel during the waking state anddissolves them, inducing the experiences of the four emptinesses [i.e.,appearance, proximity, proximate attainment and clear light]. The manner of theapplication is that in the process of first retaining the clear light of sleepone cultivates awareness of the four emptinesses of sleep. After that, whendreams occur one recognizes them as such. When awareness of the four emptinessesof sleep is present, no other technique for retention of awareness in dreams isrequired.The second method involves conscious resolution. If one is not able to succeedin the above method [of controlling the subtle energies as the means of workingwith the dream state], then during the waking state one should cultivate astrong resolution to retain conscious awareness in the dream state. In addition,one meditates on the chakras, especially that at the throat.The first of the above two techniques is the principal method of retainingdreams as taught exclusively in highest yoga tantra. The second is shared incommon with other ways.In the tradition of Lama Tsur (Tib. 'Tshur gyi lugs), the dream retention yogais accomplished in conjunction with meditating on the heart chakra. Thetradition of Lama Mey (Tib. Mes kyi lugs) recommends instead working with thethroat chakra. There are these two explanations.Some manuals comment that the meditations on the heart chakra are associatedwith the yoga of the clear light of sleep, and those on the throat chakra areassociated with dream yoga. However, if the dream yoga is being implemented bymeans of controlling the vital energies, then first one must apply thetechnology for recognizing the four emptinesses of the moment of sleep; this isaccomplished by working with the heart chakra.On the other hand, if one does not have the ability to recognize the experiencesof the four emptinesses as a means of retaining conscious awareness in dreams,and consequently the yoga is being implemented solely on the basis ofresolution, then one meditates on the throat chakra.Does this explanation of how the throat chakra is linked to retaining dreamsmean that the throat chakra is only engaged when the method is that of consciousresolution?[No. For example,] in the method of retaining dreams by means of controlling thevital energies, the throat chakra can be visualized at the time of going tosleep in order to bring the energies to this chakra and give rise to theexperience of the four emptinesses there. However, if previously the energieshad not been collected at the heart chakra then they will not collect now at thethroat chakra. Because an experience of the four emptinesses like that inducedby dissolving the energies at the heart will not arise at other sites, in thedream yogas one mainly meditates on the heart chakra at the time of going tosleep. --- - - - - - - - - - - -Through meditating on the chakras at the throat, forehead and so forth whengoing to sleep one causes the energies that had gathered at the heart to becomesomewhat diffused. This has the effect of making one's sleep less deep, and thusof rendering it easier to retain conscious awareness [during dreams]. Moreover,familiarity with meditation at the throat chakra when going to sleep causesone's dreams to last longer.If in the process of the dream yoga one wishes to extend the duration of one'sdreams, then before going to sleep one meditates on the throat chakra as before.As soon as the mind holds to it for a moment, then within the dream sphere oneengages in whatever spiritual exercises are appropriate. Thus the throat chakrahere becomes instrumental in the dream yoga technology.There is a point that should be made on the practice of retaining consciousawareness in the dream state by means of cultivating resolution. In general,even people who are not trained sometimes can experience a clear dream andretain awareness in it. Therefore it is not only through the path of meditationon retaining dream awareness that the ability occurs. For example, if someoneconcentrates strongly on a particular activity all day, then at night he maydream of it, and may even be aware of that dream. Consequently if we make someeffort during the daytime to cultivate a strong resolution to recognize andremember our dreams, and we make this resolution strong and continuousthroughout the day, then at night dreams will certainly arise and one willprobably be able to retain them. This level of the practice is not difficult toaccomplish.Should dreams fail to occur, however, it will not be possible to engage in thedream yogas. Dreams are required as the basis. Moreover, even if one doesexperience dreams it will not be easy to recognize them if they are unclear. Oneneeds to achieve clarity in them. For a dream to fit this description, oneshould be able to describe it in detail to others upon waking.In the beginning of practice, clear dreams are necessary. To achieve this it maybe necessary to dwell in solitary retreat in order to achieve clear dreaming,for solitude enhances mental clarity Then in the early morning, whenconsciousness is especially clear, it will become easy to retain the dreams.In this way during the daytime one generates strong instincts throughapplication of resolution. These must be aroused during the dream state and usedto induce a clear awareness in dreams. To accomplish this, one must practiceduring the daytime.Here the oral tradition suggests that this is best effected by meditating duringthe day on the chakras at the throat and forehead, using the radiantvisualizations as described. The mind should first be clarified by means of thebreathing exercises that unite the vital energies.If one understands these guidelines as presented in the oral tradition, one willbecome increasingly skilled in generating the appropriate experiences. Otherwise[if one doesn't understand the guidelines], only a small result will beachieved. Here the instructions are much the same in the different oraltraditions.In the practice of retaining dreams it is useful to meditate upon oneself as themandala deity, and also to meditate upon the guru and practice devotion to himor her. Offer prayers that one may experience many dreams, that the dreams maybe clear and auspicious, that one may retain awareness in one's dreams, and thatone may effectively engage the special applications in the dream state. One alsooffers prayers that unconducive conditions to these ends may not arise, and thatevery conducive condition may become manifest. For this one makes tormaofferings to the mandala deities and protectors, requests their enlightenedactivity, and establishes the basis of the practice.Thus during the day, one continually cultivates the strong resolution, combiningthis with the practice of repeating to oneself that whatever appears is like adream occurrence and should be recognized as a dream. Then when dreams occur,one consciously recognizes and retains awareness during them, and thus becomesable to implement the dream yoga practices. Directing one's thoughts in thisway, one makes stable the throwing force of resolution. Then when clear dreamsarise, one will be able to recognize and retain awareness of them. This methodin itself is sufficient.There are three instructions on how to apply the forceful methods at night astaught in the oral tradition.In the first of these, one places the mind on the mantric syllable at the throatchakra. Then before going to sleep one generates the vision of oneself as themandala deity, with one's guru seated above one's head, and offers prayers tothe guru inseparable from the mandala deity. Inside the central channel at thethroat chakra one visualizes a small red four-petalled lotus, with either asmall red mantric syllable of AH or OM standing upon it. This is in nature thevajra speech, the communicative power of enlightenment. One maintains thisvisualization with clarity, not allowing the mind to lose it, and falls asleepwithin the sphere of retaining it.Some oral traditions suggest that five mantric syllables be visualized-OM, AH,NU, TA, and RA-with one at the center and the other four around it. Onemeditates upon these successively. Others suggest that one simply visualize thered syllable AH in the center of the lotus. Thus there are two alternativetraditions.The scripture The Victorious Non-Duality Tantra (Skt. Advaya vijaya tntra)comments that one may visualize the mantric syllables OM, AH, NU, TA and RAstanding in a circle on a four-petalled lotus, but adds that this does not bringany extra power to the practice [and therefore visualizing a simple OM in thecenter will suffice].Many tantric texts, including The Sambhuta Tantra, recommend the syllable ORHowever, it is not inappropriate instead to use the mantric syllable AH. Theimportant thing, whichever mantric syllable is used, is that it is visualizedinside the central channel at the center of the throat chakra, and that oneholds awareness on that spot. If one does this and still one cannot retain thedreams, then repeat the earlier exercises.Should one still be unable to retain the dream, then one should meditate on thedrop in the chakra at the forehead. Now, sleep is usually very thick during theperiod of the very early morning, and consequently it is very difficult toretain dreams at that time. Sleep is lightest following the period of dawn untilafter the sun has arisen from the eastern mountains. Consequently it is easierto retain one's dreams at that time.One meditates on guru yoga and offers prayers that the dream yogas may beaccomplished. Next one generates a strong resolution as before, and creates thevision of oneself as the mandala deity. Then place the mind on the radiant whitedrop, the size of a mustard seed, located between the eyebrows. Perform the vasebreathing technique seven times, and go back to sleep.Here do not visualize the drop as being excessively bright, for this may resultin not being able to go back to sleep, or in sleeping only a little while andthen awakening. Visualize the drop as being somewhat less bright.Some teachers say that if one first places the mind at the syllable at thethroat chakra one will not be able to go back to sleep, and that therefore oneshould first visualize the white drop at the forehead chakra. This isn'tparticularly sensible. The throat chakra is the site from which dreams aregenerated, and the forehead chakra, that associated with the waking state. Ineffect what they are saying is that meditating on the site associated withdreams will hinder sleep, yet meditating on the site associated with the wakingstate will not.If one performs the above practice at the throat chakra at dusk or after dawnand still one is not able to retain one's dreams, this indicates that thepractitioner is a person who naturally sleeps very deeply. To somewhat lightenthe nature of sleep one should place the mind on the crown chakra.If in turn this causes one to be unable to sleep, or to sleep fitfully, thenconcentrate instead on the drop at the secret place. Here during the daytime onecultivates the resolution described earlier, and works with the chakra at thetip of the jewel. Before going to sleep one visualizes there a dark drop, andunites the vital energies twenty-one times [through vase breathing]. Within thatsphere, and without letting the mind stray, one drops off to sleep.Sometimes working with the upper sites causes one's sleep to become too light.If this occurs, one should keep in mind that the chakra at the jewel is alsoassociated with the sleep state, and therefore placing the mind on it willaffect the depth of one's sleep. One must know how to work with the differentchakras at dusk and dawn in this way in order to bring the elements [i.e., thedrops within the chakras] into balance.Some people apply themselves to these methods but still cannot gain the abilityto work with dreams. They may persist in the method for months or years, andeven then not produce the desired results. These beings must rely upon themethod of first cultivating the inner heat, bringing the vital energies into thecentral channels, causing these to abide and dissolve, and meditating on theinnate wisdom. If they cannot generate the experience of the innate wisdom, theywill not be able to retain the clear light of sleep. And without retaining theclear light of sleep through control of the vital energies they will not be ableto retain awareness in dreams.Thus if prolonged effort at retaining dreams through cultivating the power ofresolution does not produce the desired results, one should not regard thesituation as impossible. Instead one should remember that the inner heatpractice is the foundation of this path and return to it. In fact thecultivation of resolution is really intended as an aid, and not as the principaltechnique in dream yoga. To bypass the method of the inner heat and instead torely solely upon cultivating the power of resolution is like throwing away thetrunk of the tree and keeping only the branches."},{"pageContent":"CONTROLLING AND INCREASING DREAMSThe practice of controlling the contents of illusory dreams is of two types.The first of these is the control of worldly contents. Here one can engage invarious transformative exercises, such as consciously initiating a particulardream pattern, or else transforming the nature of the dream altogether.Alternatively, one can project oneself on the rays of the sun or moon to acelestial realm, such as the Thirty-Three Heaven, or to a faraway human realm,and see what is there. One trains in these various activities, such as going toplaces, flying through the sky, and so forth.The second type of this practice involves controlling the contents ofbeyond-the-world dreams. This involves consciously projecting oneself in thedream state to the various buddhafields, such as Sukhavati, Tushita, Akanishta,and so forth, and while there meeting with the buddhas and bodhisattvas,venerating them, listening to their teachings, and so forth.When these techniques are being implemented by means of controlling the vitalenergies, then one conjoins the principles of energy control with those ofgenerating strong resolution. This renders the practice more easilyaccomplished. Those who do not have the power of energy control shouldfamiliarize themselves with the exercise of cultivating resolution.These two applications are used for perceiving the pure dimensions of the worldand its inhabitants. In fact the \"pure realms\" experienced [by those on initialstages] are mere reflections of the real thing. It is not that easy toexperience the actual pure dimensions.As for prophecies received during such experiences, although certain propheciesof future happenings may be true, mostly they will not be. When the dreamvisions are related to past events [such as one's past lives], one should applythe yogic techniques for increasing reliability, such as certain methods ofapplication during the dream process, particular energy control techniques, andso forth.As for the exercise of \"increasing in dreams,\" this refers to increasing thenumber of whatever appears in the dream: whether sentient beings such as humansor animals, or inanimate objects such as a pillar or a vase. One multiplies theobject from one to two, from two to four, and so forth, until hundreds and eventhousands of the object appear."},{"pageContent":"OVERCOMING FEAR AND TRAINING IN THE ILLUSORY NATURE OF DREAMSDuring the dreaming process whenever anything of a threatening or traumaticnature occurs, such as drowning in water or being burned by fire, recognize thedream as a dream and ask yourself, \"How can dream water or dream fire possiblyharm me?\" Make yourself jump or fall into the water or fire in the dream.The method of training in the illusory nature of dreams entails that we take oneof the dream objects, such as a vase or the like, and remind ourselves that,even though this object is appearing in the dream, nonetheless it is empty ofthe nature of its appearance. Recognize dream objects as dream objects.However, merely this awareness will not necessarily mean that the non-inherentnature of dream objects is appreciated. For example, when we look at the imagein a mirror during the waking state we may be aware of the empty nature of theimage [in the sense that it is not the actual object being reflected]; but wewill not necessarily have perceived its \"suchness\" nature.When one fails to recognize the dream as a dream, the situation is like that ofa young infant who looks at his own reflection in a mirror and thinks it to be areal person. Seeing a dream as a dream is like the adult who looks at his imagein a mirror, and perceives that although the face appears in the mirror,nonetheless it is empty of possessing any actual human being.We should take the example of how a reflected image is empty of being what itappears to be, and apply this to every phenomenon in order to understand howeach is empty of having an inherent selfnature that exists from its own side.Similarly with recognizing the dream as a dream, one takes the above example [ofhow, like the reflected image, the dream is empty of existing in the nature ofits appearance] and applies this to how all phenomena are empty of possessingeven the tiniest bit of true existence. One should understand exactly how strongthe presence of the syndrome of grasping at a self-nature is, and understand thestrength of the pure reasoning required to undermine it.On the basis of that understanding one transforms the dream world and itsinhabitants into the supporting and supported mandala [i.e., residence anddeities]. One meditates on how all these appearances are empty of a trueself-nature, yet manifest as illusions. Cultivate the vision of how allphenomena are a drama of ecstasy and void.These meditations are also to be applied during the waking state."},{"pageContent":"MEDITATING UPON SUCHNESS IN DREAMSThis is to be differentiated from the practice of clear light yoga. Here onebegins by meditating upon oneself in the luminous appearance of the mandaladeity, the mantric syllable HUM at one's heart radiating with a great profusionof light. This [light] melts the animate and inanimate dream objects [intolight], which is drawn into the HUM. One's body then also melts into light, fromthe head downward and feet upward, and is absorbed into the HUM. The HUM thenmelts into unapprehendable clear light. One rests the mind unwaveringly withinthis light.It is easier to absorb the appearance of dream objects into light than it is toabsorb the energies from the objects that appear to the mind during the wakingstate. However, if at that time [of engaging dream yoga] one applies thetechnologies for absorbing certain of the coarse energies and they come to theheart chakra, then dreams will not arise and instead one will enter into deepsleep.As a remedy, cultivate recognition of the four emptinesses [i.e., the fourstages of entering into the sleep state]. If this does not succeed with thefirst few attempts, then one persists until eventually the ability to clearlydiscern these \"four emptinesses of sleep\" is achieved.To accomplish stability in these processes of the absorptions and theemptinesses, during the daytime one enhances the practice through themeditations on uniting the energies [i.e., the vase breathing technique], and soforth. Then at night when first going to sleep one attempts to recognize thestages of absorption and the four emptinesses of sleep.If this does not work, then after the dreams have commenced one should apply themethods discussed earlier. The force to recognize them should thus be aroused."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO MEDITATE ON THE ILLUSORY NATURE OF THE BARDO EXPERIENCEThis yoga is taught under two headings: a discussion of the underlyingphilosophy of the bardo experience; and a discussion of the stages of the bardoyoga practice.THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY OF THE BARDO EXPERIENCEThe moment when death arrests the life force, and the moment when the bardoexperience is produced: these two arise like the up and down movements of aweight scale.One is instantly born into the bardo with a body complete in all sensory powers.In shape it resembles that of the incarnation to be taken, and it possessesgreat karmic powers of miraculous physical ability. With the exception of theplace of future rebirth, it can travel anywhere without impediment, and can passfreely through solid matter.\"The life span of this bardo body is a maximum of seven days, yet even thislength is not definite. At the end of this period it ceases; and, if one has nottaken rebirth into the world, then another bardo body appears. Again, if onedoes not find conditions for rebirth within the seven days of its life span,then it dies, and one gets a third bardo body. In this way one can repeat thecycle seven times, making a total of forty-nine bardo days. After that one willcertainly have to take rebirth.One receives a sign indicating which of the four types of birth one is attractedto: miraculous birth, birth by heat and moisture, birth from an egg, or birthfrom a womb. In the first situation, one is attracted to the place of therebirth. If the birth indicated is by heat and moisture, one is attracted to thesmells, tastes, and so forth of the place. When the birth is to be by egg orfrom a womb, one develops lust and aversion at the vision of the future parentshaving actual intercourse or seeming intercourse.Moreover, when one is unfolding toward rebirth as a female, lust arises towardthe father and aversion toward the mother. Conversely, if one is unfoldingtoward rebirth as a male, lust for the mother arises, and aversion for thefather.For some it is their aversion to a place that will bring them to take rebirth init.Those in the bardo who are experiencing the effects of past negative karmicdeeds experience a dark vision, like that of a night sky with no stars. Those ofpositive karmic disposition experience a clear and radiant vision, like that ofa white woolen cloth, or like a night sky filled with moonlight.When the bardo experience is leading to a rebirth in one of the hell realms,one's bodily color resembles a burned tree stump. When it is leading to theanimal realms, one's color is like that of smoke. When it is leading to theworld of ghosts, one's body is a color like that of water; and when the bardo isleading to rebirth in the human or sensual god realms, it is a golden color. Thebardo being who is destined for the form realms is white in color. This isrelated in The Sutra on Entering into the Womb (Skt. Garbha vakranti sutra).This same sutra states,Those beings who [die in and thus] leave the formless realms do experience abardo. However, beings who die in the two lower realms [i.e., the kamadhatu andrupadhatu] and are destined for birth in the formless realms experience no bardowhatsoever. Immediately after leaving their old bodies they take rebirth in theformless realm, with the aggregates [i.e., the body-mind base] of that formlessworld.Others say that there is no bardo associated with the formless realms, becausethe formless realms have no upper or lower boundaries. This is their own idea[and there is no scriptural basis for the doctrine].The Treasury of Abhidharma (Skt. Abhidharma kosha) states, \"...having the formof the future incarnation.\" Thus the Abhidharma literature suggests that theform of one's body in the bardo resembles that of the future existence.Not understanding this passage, some teachers have said that the form resemblesthat of the previous life, and that one's companions and so forth of that lifemanifest. Others have quoted The Compendium of Abhidharma (Skt. Abhidharmasamucchaya), wherein it is said, \"The face and body resemble those of the futurelife.\" Having seen this passage, they state that one's form in the bardo is thatof one's future incarnation, and that one's friends of that incarnation willalso manifest [in the bardo experience].\" - -- - - - - - - - - -- - - -Still others speak of a bardo body that is a blending of the two above ideas ofpast and future forms. Here it is said that during the first three and a halfdays [of each seven-day cycle], one has the form and world vision of theprevious life, and during the last three and a half days, the form and vision ofthe future life. After the three-and-ahalf day period one experiences theawareness that one has died and is in the bardo. Such is their theory; but noauthoritative scriptural source whatsoever for it is ever given, nor is itsupported particularly well by reason. Thus it is mere speculation.The etymology of the term \"bardo\" is given in A Treasury of Abhidharma,We die in this world, and later take rebirth; Between these two is \"the bardoworld.\"Thus the sense is that the bardo world is experienced from the moment of ourdeath until rebirth takes place. Hence it is an \"in-between realm.\" There isnothing other than life, death and the bardo, or \"state in-between\"; thus it issimply called \"the in-between of becoming,\" or \"the in-between realm.\" This isthe sense of the above Abhidharma passage.However, in this tradition [i.e., that of the Six Yogas] we see three \"bardostates\" being mentioned 52 Firstly, there is \"the bardo between birth anddeath,\" which refers to the [waking-state] period from our birth to our death,including the present moment. Secondly, there is \"the dream bardo,\" which is theperiod between when we go to sleep until we wake up. Thirdly, the time fromdeath until rebirth is known as \"the bardo realm,\" or \"the bardo of becoming.\"What is the sense of-this- mode of categorizing existential experience?Here the Arya Cycle of the Guhyasamaja tradition speaks of how the experience ofthe four emptinesses [of appearance, proximity, proximate attainment and clearlight] gives rise to the clear light. This is experienced much the same way asthe clear light of death is experienced after the dissolution of bodilyprocesses is complete. The yogi then produces the illusory body [by means of thefour emptinesses and blisses mentioned above]; this is similar to how the bardobody is produced [after the clear light of death]. This [i.e., the illusorybody] becomes the subtle Sambhogakaya, which takes upon itself a coarseNirmanakaya form, much in the same way that the bardo body takes rebirth with aworldly form.Those beings who do not possess yogic abilities will experience these threeoccasions as ordinary birth, death and bardo. However, yogis holding the oraltradition teachings know how to take the three kayas at the time of the path[i.e., the ordinary dimensions of these three] and transform them into the threekayas at the time of the result [i.e., in buddhahood]. Appreciating thesimilarities and connections between the three occasions [birth, death andbardo] and three kayas, during both occasions of path and result, the name \"thethree occasions for spiritual practice\" is applied to the basis of the threekayas on these three occasions, and the name \"the three kayas\" is also appliedto the three events as the basis. I have discussed these ideas in detailelsewhere.Suffice it to say here that when during the waking state we meditate uponproducing the illusory body, this is similar to the manner in which the bardobody arises; therefore the name \"bardo\" is sometimes applied to this occasion.Similarly, when we enter into the clear light of the moment of sleep and thenpass into the dream state, the illusory dream body that arises is similar innature to the bardo body; this is the reason for using the expression \"the dreambardo.\" And because when special [i.e., highly trained] beings pass through thestage of the clear light of death and enter into the bardo they apply thetechnology for manifesting [the bardo body as] a Sambhogakaya form, thisexperience is also termed a \"bardo.\"Thus in this tradition we see these three predominant usages of the term\"bardo.\" However, those who understand correctly the context of the applicationare rare. The sense is that the three occasions of the basis [i.e., birth, deathand bardol are to be transformed into occasions for manifestation of the threekayas. The meaning is that the two sets of three are to be blended.In brief, the above description leads to there being talk of three \"illusorybodies\": the illusory body of the waking state; that of the illusory dream body;and the illusory body which is produced in the bardo. These three are linked tothe three bardos of the [three] basic occasions [waking state, dreams andbardo].How do we proceed in the training of these three bardos?Here during the waking state one practices meditation on the inner heat, thuscausing the vital energies to enter into the central channel, and to abide anddissolve. Through the force of this experience one induces the experiences ofthe four emptinesses, four blisses, and the clear light consciousness. Theexperience is like that of the time of death, when the vital energies andconsciousnesses naturally withdraw from the body into the central channel andthe clear light of death manifests.The meditations on the three clear light consciousnesses-the clear lightexperienced through yogic endeavor in the waking state, the clear light ofsleep, and the clear light of the moment of death-are similar in that all threerequire that one understand the process of dissolving the vital energies andconsciousnesses into the central channel just as at the moment of death, and howthus to induce the experience of the four emptinesses and four blisses.If one understands these three sets of three processes, then in the waking stateapplication the subtle illusory body can take the form of a coarse Nirmanakaya.Also, the dream yoga can be used in the gap at the end of dreams and beforewaking up to cause the subtle Sambhogakaya [generated in dream yoga] to take acoarse Nirmanakaya. Similarly, after the moment of the clear light of death haspassed and one enters the bardo, the same technique can be used to transform thebardo body into a Sambhogakaya form; and that in turn can be used to take acoarse Nirmanakaya form.This process is sophisticated, and one should attempt to get a clearcomprehension of it. If one can gain insight into the basic principles at workin the dissolutions, then the three blendings-the clear light of death with theDharmakaya, the bardo body with the Sambhogakaya, and the rebirth body with theNirmanakaya-can be accomplished.In brief, the dynamics of these three peerless processes-or, if each of thethree is spoken of as threefold, then the nine processes-should be understoodwell.Mistaking the basic thrust of this doctrine, some teachers apply the concept ofthe three blendings quite differently, stating that one blends passion with thethird empowerment, confusion with the clear light, and aversion with theillusory body. However, although it is true that one does adopt the path ofpassion when actually receiving the third initiation, this empowerment is infact just a preliminary [in the overall tantric training], which one needs inorder to take up the meditations and yogas of the generation and completionstages of tantric application. Now, during the generation stage yoga there is notechnique for these blendings; and even though this technology is taught in thecompletion stage yogas, it is not associated with the above phase of practice.Extending the doctrine that when the bardo being enters the womb of its newrebirth it experiences lust for the parent of the opposite sex and aversiontoward the parent of the same sex [as the being it will be in its nextlifetime], some lamas have stated that one should blend aversion with theillusory body. They pronounce this based on the above doctrine, and with noother supporting reason. However, they do not elucidate how this is relevant tothe all-important illusory body yoga of the waking state, or to the blending ofthe illusory body of dreams. [Of the three illusory body yogas, i.e., those ofwaking state, dreams and bardo,] here it seems that these teachers arediscarding the first two very important types of illusory body yoga in favor ofthe third. In addition, this approach doesn't address the problem of how, oncethe clear light of the moment of death has passed and one enters into the bardo,the bardo body is blended with the illusory body dynamic [to produce theSambhogakaya]. Moreover, the association made with aversion is rather random;for example, at the time of entering the womb the bardo being is also said togenerate lust [for the parent of the opposite sex], so the illusory body yogacould just as validly be linked with passion. Thus the concept doesn't seemparticularly useful.Another quaint idea one sometimes sees proposes that because lust is strong inlife, one should then blend lust with the bardo of birth to death; [becauseconfusion is strong in dreams,] one should blend confusion with the bardo ofdreams; and [because aversion is strong in the bardo,] one should blend aversionwith the bardo of becoming [between death and rebirth]. [In this way one blendsthe three root klesha, or emotional and perceptual distortions, with the threebardos.] This also is not a particularly useful hypothesis, for the reasonsstated above. In particular, it does not account for the passage in the tantricscriptures that states, \"In the space between sleep and dream lies confusion, innature the Dharmakaya.\" As this quotation indicates, on going to sleep andbefore entering dreams one should recognize and retain the experience of theclear light of sleep. They accept the above quotation as valid and link it toblending confusion and dreams, whereas the \"confusion\" in the passage actuallyrefers to the clear light experience. Thus the passage they use to support theiridea in fact contradicts what they are trying to say.Some people claim that in some remote corner of Marpa's oral instructions thereis the teaching that one should blend lust with nonejaculation yoga, aversionwith the illusory body yoga, and confusion with the clear light yoga. The firsttwo of these statements are unconvincing.Also, some lamas speak of the three \"blendings\" as follows. The meditations onthe two yogic stages [i.e., generation and completion stage] are to be blendedwith the bardo of birth and death; after cultivating that process, the dreambardo is to be blended with confusion and the clear light, and brought into thetwo tantric stages in that way; and, thirdly, the bardo of becoming is to beblended with aversion and dharmata [i.e., the ultimate nature of things], andthus brought into the two tantric stages. This is the interpretation they giveto \"the three blendings.\" Although this is said, I fail to see any real sense init.There is also a discussion of further sub-dividing the three bodies of the threebardo states, until we get fifteen bardos. As this is rather simplistic, I willnot write of it here."},{"pageContent":"THE STAGES OF THE BARDO YOGA PRACTICEThis is discussed under two headings: the types of beings who can practice inthe bardo; and the nature of the training.THE TYPES OF BEINGS WHO CAN PRACTICE IN THE BARDOIt is said that there are three levels of beings who can practice in the bardo:best, medium and least.The qualities of the first of these are mentioned in tantric scriptures such asThe Book of Manjushri's Direct Instructions (Skt. Manjushri mukhagama), ACompendium of Tantric Experiences (Skt. Charya melapaka pradipa), and The ClearLamp (Skt. Pradipoddyotana), wherein it is said that the best practitioner takesthe bardo body that appears at the end of the dying process and transforms itinto a Sambhogakaya, and on that basis accomplishes enlightenment in the bardo.Therefore there is the saying from some Tibetan lama-scholars of old thatstates, \"The lazy attain enlightenment in the bardo.\" Actually, they are notreally that lazy. It is simply that they did not accomplish all the conditionsof enlightenment during their lifetime, but came close enough so thatenlightenment could be attained in the bardo. Thus they are only called \"lazy\"from one particular perspective.How deep must be the state of realization accomplished in this lifetime in orderfor one to qualify as the \"best bardo practitioner\"? One must have completed therealizations of the generation stageyogas and then, in the completion stage yogas, must have mastered the techniqueof directing the vital energies into the central channel and causing them toabide and dissolve, thus generating the experiences of the four blisses and fouremptinesses, together with the according primordial wisdoms. Thus they must havealmost reached the stage of manifesting the actual illusory body in theirmeditations.The mark of medium practitioners is that they are able to bring the vitalenergies into the central channel and dissolve them, thus generating the fouremptinesses. Based on that ability they gain the power to achieve the blendingof the clear light of sleep [during their lifetime]. This is a highly praisedaccomplishment, for through the power of that energy control they are able toengage the blending of the emptiness of the clear light of death. Thus if duringtheir lifetime they are able to blend with the emptiness of deep sleep, then atdeath they will be able to blend with the clear light of death. If even in verydeep sleep they are able to retain the clear light of sleep, this is anexcellent sign.As for the least qualification for practicing the bardo yoga, here the traineemust have received the empowerments, be stable in guarding the tantriccommitments, have made some progress in the generation stage yogas, and havecultivated some familiarity with the completion stage yogas.Then when the time of death arrives, he or she maintains awareness as the signsof the dissolution process occur, beginning with the earth energies dissolvinginto those of water, and so forth, up to the emergence of the clear light ofdeath. Knowledgeable of this process, he or she observes it closely, an abilityacquired by having cultivated fluency in the oral tradition teachings on theprocess. The technique is similar to the manner in which the dream yoga isaccomplished by means of resolution. He or she is unable to recognize and retainthe clear light of death by means of the energy control yogas, and so engages inthe bardo yogas on the strength of previous familiarity with the oral traditionteachings.Alternatively, for those who are not qualified in this way, but who haveachieved some meditative stability, then as the moment of death draws near theyshould engage in their samadhi and make the stream of it strong, meditating inaccordance with the way they practiced during their lifetime. The strength ofthis will then carry over into the bardo. If during this crucial experience thatpositive mind can be recollected, it will have a beneficial impact on theprocess of dying and the bardo. However, this is a quite ordinary samadhiapplication."},{"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE TRAININGThe best of the three types of practitioners are said to accomplish buddhahoodin the bardo. They were unable to do so during their actual lifetime, but duringthe death process are able to recognize the manifestation of the clear light andapply the according technology.There is the popular saying, \"One achieves enlightenment on first entering intothe bardo.\" This isn't particularly meaningful, and contradicts manyauthoritative tantric scriptures. The moment of first entering the bardo refersto the culmination of the clear light experience. The clear light vision isactually classified as belonging to this life [and not the bardo]. Moreover, noauthoritative tantric scriptures speak of enlightenment being achieved at thatmoment.To attain the Dharmakaya for the first time one must rely upon a suitablebody-base. Otherwise the established doctrines on the process are contradicted.The body-base present at that moment [i.e., the first moment of the bardo] couldnot manifest the marks and signs of the accomplishment states of \"great union oftraining\" and \"great union beyond training.\"Thus the expression \"blend the clear light of death with the Dharmakaya\"actually refers to recognizing the clear light of death and blending it with asense of something approximating the Dharmakaya. The name \"Dharmakaya\" is givento this phenomenon, but it is not the actual Dharmakaya.The yogi must pass through the death process and emerge with a bardo body. Buteven then merely recognizing the bardo and applying simple yogas on the basis ofthat [ordinary bardo body] will not produce the supreme accomplishment ofbuddhahood.Here the best type of practitioner must recognize the nature of the bardo body,and then control the most subtle aspects of energy and mind in order totransform it into a Sambhogakaya form. Elsewhere [I have] discussed in detailthe methods of doing this.Those who belong to the category of the two types of \"less-qualifiedpractitioners\" should attempt to bring the mind into a state of clarity as themoment of death approaches. In their thoughts they dedicate all their worldlypossessions to worthy receivers and sources of merit. Thus they sever allconditions of attachment. They should consciously acknowledge to themselves anytransgressions of their practice guidelines that occurred during their lifetime,as well as any general spiritual failings, and then purify these and renew theirspiritual precepts. In this way they squarely face the thought of impendingdeath without any attachments or fears.Those familiar with the oral tradition teachings on the stages of dying and thenature of the bardo offer prayers and cultivate the resolution to remember theguidelines of advice during the dying and bardo experiences, and generate joylike a child returning to its parents' house. As the moment of death approachesthey generate the vision of self-identification with the mandala deity,visualizing the gurus and the assembly of enlightenment deities in the space infront, offering them devotions, and sending forth prayers for inspiration andblessings for success in applying the yogas of blending with the clear light atthe moment of death, and thereafter blending with the illusory bardo body.The second type of practitioner, prior to the arising of the signs of death thatoccur in the dying process, applies whatever abilities he or she possesses inorder to cause the energies to enter the central channel and give rise to theexperience of the four emptinesses. At the conclusion of that phase he or sheapplies the special methods for arising as a mandala deity, of recognizing thefour emptinesses of entering into sleep, and applying the same technology as wasused for generating the illusory body of dreams. He or she repeats theseexercises many times [prior to the onset of the dying process], and thenobserves for the signs of elemental dissolution that precede the experience ofdeath. This involves the twenty states of dissolution that occur during thedying process prior to the experience of the clear light of death.In brief this process is as follows.First the earth element dissolves into the water element. The external sign isthat one loses the ability to move one's limbs or control the body, and has anappearance of total relaxation. The thought arises, \"My body is sinking into theearth,\" and there is an urge to call for someone to pull one up. The inner signis a vision having a miragelike quality.Next the water element dissolves into the fire element. The external sign isdryness of mouth and nose, and a shrivelling of the tongue. The inner sign is avision as though of smoke.The fire element now dissolves into the air element. The external sign is thatone's body heat begins to drop, withdrawing from the extremities [toward theheart]. The inner sign is a vision like that of seeing many fireflies.The air element of conceptual thought dissolves into mind. Here the vitalenergies that support conceptual thought dissolve into consciousness. Theexternal sign is that a long breath is exhaled, and the body seems unable toinhale. Even if one can inhale, one does so shallowly yet heavily. The innersign is a vision of a light resembling that of a butterlamp undisturbed by windmovement.After this the first emptiness occurs, known simply as \"emptiness.\" This is theexperience of the vision known as \"appearance.\" The inner sign is of whiteness,like seeing moonlight in a cloudless sky.The consciousness of \"appearance\" then dissolves into the second emptiness,known as \"very empty\" This is the experience of the vision known as \"proximity.\"The inner vision is of a yellowish red light, like that of the light at sunrise.This dissolves into the third emptiness, \"the great emptiness,\" which is linkedto the experience of the vision known as \"proximate attainment.\" The innervision is of utter darkness, like that of a night sky pervaded by thickdarkness. The person has a sensation of swooning, and loses consciousness.After this the person emerges from the darkness and the state of mindlessness,and arises into the experience of \"utter emptiness,\" also termed \"the clearlight.\" The vision is of a color like the blending of the lights of sun and moonin a sky free from all darkness, like the clear sky at early dawn. This is theclear light that is the actual basis.In this way one experiences the three emptinesses, together with the \"emptiness\"of the clear light consciousness.In the stages of experiencing the three emptinesses and the clear lightemptiness, first there are the external signs of the dissolution of theelements: the visions as though of a mirage, of smoke, of fireflies, of thelight of a butterlamp, and of a cloudless sky. The signs of the innerdissolutions are those of whiteness, redness, blackness, and the clear light ofearly dawn.Some say that the experiences of the two sets occur together. Others say they donot. The latter approach is correct. The external signs of smoke and so forthactually precede the experience of the four emptinesses. This is stated in manyauthoritative tantric scriptures.The four visions associated with the four \"emptinesses\" are all experienced as acloudless sky, with a difference in the color; first white, and then red, black,and finally a clear radiance.By the time the clear light experience occurs, the three vision-like emptinessexperiences [i.e., appearance, proximity and proximate attainment] have alreadytaken place and the vital energies have gathered into the indestructible drop atthe heart chakra. The white drop has descended from the crown chakra [during thefirst emptiness, with the vision of whiteness], the red drop has risen from thenavel chakra [during the second emptiness, with the vision of redness], and thetwo came together at the heart [during the third emptiness, with the vision ofdarkness].Although sentient beings other than those possessing the six constituents alsoexperience death and the process of dissolution leading up to the emergence ofthe clear light, they are not able to recognize or work with the natural dynamicof the situation.The signs of the dissolution of the elements and the experience of them all takeplace prior to actual death. One should understand the process well. From thetime the first sign occurs one applies whatever methods one is competent in fordirecting the energies into the central channel. As each of the four signs[indicating the dissolution of the four elements] occurs, one must recognize andconfirm the experience, linking mindfulness of the vision of emptiness with theactual occurrence. In the remaining dissolutions one stabilizes the resolutionto engage the yogic applications and \"blendings.\"During the experience of the clear light of death, the subtle energies andconsciousness collect into the central channel. The subtle energies enter intothe heart chakra, and all coarse activity of the confused mind of dualitybecomes pacified. A vision like that of a cloudless sky manifests. One mustrecognize this vision when it occurs, place the mind firmly within it, and applywhatever was achieved through meditation upon the middle view of voidness duringone's lifetime.If during one's lifetime one did not cultivate this ability to place the mind inthe view of emptiness, then there will be no way to do so now. Therefore it isfundamental to the success of the bardo yogas that during one's lifetime onecultivates two qualities: the ability to place the mind in a stableunderstanding of emptiness; and the yogic means of inducing the four blisses.One must apply this technology here for taking \"the child clear light\" as \"theclear light of the path.\" Jetsun Milarepa stated,The clear light of death is in nature the Dharmakaya; one must recognize it forwhat it is. To achieve that ability one must have been introduced to it by one'sspiritual master. Cultivate knowledge of the essence of the ultimate view, andof the technology for bringing the clear light into the stream of theconventional path.This fundamental clear light of death is in nature \"the mother clear light.\" Onemust blend it with \"the child clear light of the path.\"To gain the ability [to do this at the time of death] one must practice for itin this lifetime. During the waking state one brings the vital energies into thecentral channel and there causes them to abide and dissolve; one must gainfamiliarity in this way with the four emptinesses, and particularly \"utteremptiness\" [i.e., the fourth emptiness, or clear light]. Also, during sleep oneblends awareness with the clear light of sleep, no matter how deep one's sleepis. When one trains during the waking and sleeping states in this way, thestrength of control over the subtle energies and mind that one achieves willprovide one with the power to blend \"mother and child clear lights\" at the timeof death.If one can recognize the clear light of death in this way and blend with it asinstructed, one will be able to recognize the bardo experiences that follow andconsequently will be able to apply the yogic technology [for achievingenlightenment in the bardo]. Therefore it is said that the supreme method ofimplementing the bardo yogas depends upon the ability to recognize and blendwith the clear light of death. In fact, there is no \"best\" way to implement itother than that.A lesser method is to cultivate the thought, \"I am dead. These appearances mustbe bardo manifestations.\" However, even though this thought may possibly helpone to recognize the fact that one is in the bardo, the realization will beweak.Likewise one can cultivate meditation on the dissolution of the elements and soforth, as occurs at the time of death [as described earlier]. Then when the fouremptinesses of the clear light of death manifest, one can apply whatever samadhiwas achieved during one's lifetime. Yet if during one's lifetime one did notlearn to direct the vital energies into the central channel, then it isdifficult to classify the method [implemented at the time of death] as belongingto the extraordinary category of a highest yoga tantra practice.Therefore those with interest in these [bardo yogas, which belong to highestyoga tantra practice] should not be like the person who ignores the trunk of thetree and takes only the branches. From the very depths of the marrow of theirbones they should aspire to cultivate the yoga of the inner heat and its puremeans of bringing the vital energies into the central channel, as was describedearlier. During the waking state they should bring the vital energies into thecentral channel, and cause them to abide and dissolve there. In this way theyinduce the experience of the four emptinesses. When this practice becomes maturethey then learn to retain the clear light of sleep by means of controlling thesubtle energies.After thus cultivating the meditations on the clear light consciousness in thewaking state and the clear light consciousness of sleep, one applies the yogictechnology for arousing the illusory body. This will empower one with a mostwonderful ability to recognize the clear light of death and the ensuing bardo.For all of this, the foundation is the inner heat yoga. Always remember thisbasic principle.One recognizes and retains the clear light of death. Then when one begins topass beyond the clear light and into the bardo, one engages the key points inarousing meditative familiarity and resolution. With these as the guidelines oneenters into the bardo with confidence and the positive mind, while engaging thetechnology for recognizing the bardo visions as illusions, and arising with theillusory body of a tantric mandala deity.Recognizing the bardo in this way, one determines to achieve a more highlyqualified bardo body. The ordinary bardo body by itself is not an adequatevehicle with which to achieve highest spiritual power. The difference comes whenone applies a number of factors: meditating upon oneself as a mandala deity;cultivating meditation on the view of emptiness; cultivating the vision that theworld and its inhabitants are like illusory appearances; meditating upon how,just as the dream yoga teaching points to the illusory nature of the dream body,the same principles are applied in the bardo yoga; and so forth. Theseteachings, drawn from the oral tradition in this way, are termed \"the bardoteachings.\" One engages in them.It is not certain that the yogic practitioners familiar with these methods willtake birth in a womb. They may be born in any of the other three ways. Thereforeit is important that one apply the instruction on seeing all appearances asdeity manifestations, seeing the body of the deity as an illusion, and seeingthe illusory appearances as empty of self-nature.One cultivates these meditations well. In addition, by cultivating awareness ofthe parent-like guru as male-female in union, and the mandala deity asmale-female in union, etc., a special strength is brought into the application.Then there is the technique known as \"the oath of rebirth.\" Here one cultivatesthe aspiration to take rebirth into any of the pure buddha lands.In the oral tradition teachings of Marpa there is one instruction that speaks ofrecognizing the bardo, and then sending forth the aspiration to take rebirth ina higher world. This is similar to what we will see later, in the section onconsciousness transference."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO MEDITATE UPON THE CLEAR LIGHT YOGASThis is taught under two headings: how one meditates upon the clear light duringthe waking period; and how to meditate upon the clear light during sleep.HOW TO MEDITATE UPON THE CLEAR LIGHT DURING THE WAKING PERIODThe clear light is discussed in two contexts.The first of these is the general usage. Here it is said that the fundamentalreality of being is something free from the extremes of being and non-being.This is the emptiness nature, the \"clear light as object.\" The consciousnessthat perceives it is the \"clear light as subject\" [i.e., awareness].This is the general meaning to the term \"clear light.\" The usage is common toboth Hinayana and Mahayana vehicles, to the Paramita yana and Mantrayanavehicles, to all three lower tantra vehicles, and to highest yoga tantra. Thusthis is the definition of the clear light in a general sense.The second usage of the term \"clear light\" is exclusive to highest yoga tantra.Here there is no difference in the sense of \"clear light as object.\" Thedifference is in the \"clear light as subject,\" the perceiving mind. Here this isthe great innate ecstasy consciousness, which is the specialty of highest yogatantra. Thus it is called \"the exclusive clear light.\" Its prerequisite ismainly the innate ecstasy consciousness that is aroused by proficiency in thecompletion stage yogas for bringing the vital energies into the central channeland causing them to abide and dissolve there.This is not simply the mind of bliss aroused by the melting of the bodhimindsubstances and placing the mind in non-conceptual meditative absorption freefrom torpor or agitation, which is a non-conceptual state induced by sublimatingsome of the vital energies. Even on the generation stage there was some meltingproduced from the ecstasy of the energy application. This is not what is beingused here. One must appreciate these distinctions.What is being referred to here is the innate ecstasy aroused by means of theinner heat yoga described earlier, known as \"the great innate ecstasy of thecompletion stage.\" This is conjoined with stabilized awareness of suchness, oremptiness, which gives rise to \"the primordial wisdom of ecstasy and emptiness.\"That is what is here posited as the clear light as \"subject.\" It is the clearlight of the path, having the illusory body of the completion stage as itspredecessor. Based on prolonged familiarity with that practice, one produces theillusory body, and then uses this in the meditation. This is an exalteddimension of the clear light principle. To engage it one requires the innerbasis of the attainment of either the actual illusory body or a proxy. This isthen immersed in the clear light.As for the stages of merging into the clear light, most of the oral traditionteachings [on the Six Yogas] are somewhat unclear on this point. Some of them,however, do provide excellent documentation.These latter recommend that one visualize oneself as the mandala deity, male andfemale in sexual union, the \"wheel of truth\" chakra at the heart, the centralchannel running through it. One meditates on a blue mantric syllable HUMstanding on a sun disk located there. Lights emanate from this and purify theinanimate universe. The universe melts into clear light, which absorbs into theanimate universe. These then melt into clear light and into oneself as themandala deity. The female aspect melts into the male of the mandala deity.Then from one's crown downward and feet upward one melts into light, which isabsorbed into the syllable HUM at one's heart.The syllable HUM then melts into light from the bottom upward, beginning withthe U vowel underneath melting into the AH, that into the HA, that into its ownhead, that into the crescent moon above, that into the drop, and that into thenada above it. In this way all is absorbed into the center of the centralchannel at the heart chakra.One places the mind firmly there, causing the energies from the side channels ofrasana and lalana to enter, abide and dissolve within the central channel,arousing the four emptinesses, and giving rise to the amazing clear lightconsciousness of the path. When this occurs one observes the mind of the greatinnate ecstasy and then holds to it.As said earlier, this process for both the illusory body and clear light yogasis wonderfully elucidated in the oral tradition of the Arya Cycle of Guhyasamajateachings. The manner of merging with the clear light as described immediatelyabove is also similar to the special dhyana for entering into the clear light astaught in the Guhyasamaja tradition of The Five Stages. Therefore mypresentation above is somewhat adorned by the mode of explanation found in theoral tradition of the Guhyasamaja system.Previously in the meditations on the inner heat one absorbed the vital energiesinto the central channel and gave rise to the innate ecstasy. Here again onedirects the energies into the central channel and invokes the stages ofdissolution as explained in that earlier process, giving rise to the innategreat ecstasy and eventually the clear light.If one is unable to do this, then whatever familiarity with the dissolutionprocess one has achieved should here be applied.I have written on this technology in greater depth elsewhere."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO MEDITATE UPON THE CLEAR LIGHT DURING SLEEPIf the situation is such that one can retain the clear light of sleep by meansof controlling the vital energies, then as explained before one does this andengages in the dream yogas. Retaining the clear light of sleep is the suprememethod for working in the dream state. To accomplish the application in this wayis in accord with how most previous lineage masters have taught on the subject.[../Images/img0004.jpg]The syllable HUMBefore engaging in the practice one should follow a healthy diet, dress warmly,and so forth. There is also a tradition of cutting one's sleep for two or threedays, but this is not always done. The important thing is to make one's sleepmore light. When sleep is heavy it is more difficult for the novice in thepractice to retain the clear light of sleep. When sleep is subtle, this clearlight is more easily retained. One wants to create the latter condition. Thenwhen the practice becomes mature one may succeed under the former condition. Atthat time one will not have to cut one's sleep [to create a lighter sleepstate], although one may do so in order to observe the progress of the yoga inconditions of deep sleep.The practice here is to engage in devotional exercises focusing upon the ThreeJewels of Refuge during the day and evening, and make torma offerings to theDharma Protectors. Send forth prayers that one may recognize the clear light ofsleep, and that obstructions to this may be mitigated. One meditates on oneselfas the mandala deity. Also, one meditates on guru yoga and sends forth manyprayers for blessing power to assist in the effort to retain the clear light ofsleep.Then one makes firm the resolution that as one goes to sleep one will recognizeand retain the four emptinesses that occur prior to the emergence of dreams. Onelies on one's right side in the sleeping lion posture, with one's head to thenorth, back to the east, face to the west and feet to the south, one's rightfoot on top of the left, and right arm tucked underneath the body. Onevisualizes oneself as the mandala deity, and envisions a blue four-petalledlotus at one's heart chakra, the central channel running through it, a bluemantric syllable HUM at its center.Here there are the two traditions: that of placing the mantric syllables AH, NU,TA and RA respectively on the four lotus petals, with HUM at the center; andthat of using only the syllable HUM.In the former case, the AH is placed in the east, NU in the south, TA in thewest and RA in the north. One first places the awareness on AH; then when sleepis about to begin one switches awareness to NU, and there occurs the first\"emptiness,\" known simply as \"empty\" and as \"appearance.\" One places awarenesson TA, and the second \"emptiness,\" known as \"very empty\" and as \"proximity,\"occurs. One places awareness on RA; the experience of \"great empty\" and\"proximate attainment\" occurs. Finally one places awareness at the syllable HUMat the center of the central channel; the fourth emptiness, known as \"utterlyempty,\" arises.It is said that one should meditate on these mantric syllables in conjunctionwith the occurrence of the four emptinesses in this way. However, although someteachers give this instruction, it seems to me that they are overlooking theprinciple that envisioning the syllables at the center of the central channel iswhat causes the vital energies to be drawn into the heart chakra, giving rise tothe experiences of entering, abiding and dissolving, which in turn inducesexperience of the four emptinesses. Therefore although it is said that themantric syllables are to be envisioned at the heart chakra, it is not statedsufficiently clearly that these must be inside the central channel of avadhutiat the center of the heart chakra. Hence even though there is mention made [inthose oral traditions] of linking these auxiliary mantric syllables to theprocess of the \"emptinesses,\" in fact the manner in which most lineages todaypresent them undermines the basis of accomplishing the desired result. Thereforethere is no significant advantage in using the syllables AH NU TA RA, and it isacceptable to dispense with them altogether [i.e., to simply visualize thesyllable HUM at the center, as described above]. The important point, in eitherof the two methods, is that the mind is placed at the center of the centralchannel inside the heart chakra.The yogis who engage in this practice of retaining the clear light of sleep areof two types: those who have previously achieved samadhi able to abide in firmmeditation, and those who have not.In the latter case, on going to sleep the yogi cultivates the instructions asabove and attempts to rest in that samadhi once sleep sets in. However, thiswill only last a short time. He must arouse the awareness that he is in thesleep state [in order to pursue the concentration], but this is difficult underthese conditions. Thus he will be unable to remain in the contemplation for verylong.If one goes to sleep without first bringing the vital energies under controlthen one will not be able to cut off the subtle passage of breath through thetwo nostrils, and as a result one will not arouse an actual experience of even asemblance of the fourth emptiness. The qualified experience will not arise, andthus the actuality of retaining the clear light of sleep will not be achieved.The practitioners who have achieved the samadhi of firm placement are also oftwo types. The first of these have, during the waking state, cultivated athorough familiarity with the process of the inner heat yogas. By means of itthey have brought the vital energies into dhuti, causing them to enter, abideand dissolve there, and given rise to the experience of the [four] emptinesses.In this case while going to sleep they cultivate the visualizations as explainedabove, with the syllable HUM at the center of dhuti inside the heart chakra.Within two or three days they are able to recognize the stages of dissolutioninto the four emptinesses of sleep, and will gain the ability to retain theclear light of sleep.Even if one is not able to induce the experiences of the four emptinesses duringthe waking state, one should in general make firm the samadhi characterized asblissful, radiant and beyond conceptuality. One then engages the abovevisualization at the time of going to bed and attempts to recognize thedissolutions. If still these [four emptinesses] are not recognized, onecontinues to cultivate samadhi during the daytime, and eventually this willcarry over into the sleep state. Here stable samadhi conjoined with ecstasy isenough; there is no need to bring the vital energies into the central channel.However, in such a situation the practice could not be said to be a highest yogatantra method for inducing retention of the clear light of sleep. The degree towhich one can hold the visualization inside the heart chakra is the degree towhich the seeds of success in the practice are planted.The power to experience samadhi in sleep by means of cultivating ordinarysamadhi powers [during the waking state], even when conjoined with meditation onthe view of suchness, will induce only a conventional experience of the clearlight of sleep [i.e., the experience will only be on the coarse level ofconsciousness]. It will not induce the experience of the clear light of sleep asdescribed in highest yoga tantra [i.e., on the most subtle level ofconsciousness]. Hence it will not qualify as a practice of highest yoga tantra.Nonetheless, meditating in that way and envisioning the mantric syllable (orsyllables) and so forth as explained above does plant the instincts forenfoldment in that direction.This \"shared\" samadhi [i.e., common to highest tantra and other paths] canproduce the ability to dwell in actual samadhi during the sleep state, and canbe conjoined with awareness of the view of emptiness in order to give rise to anexperience of the \"clear light of the shared path.\" However, it is not the clearlight consciousness induced through practice of highest yoga tantra.As explained earlier, one should meditate on the heart chakra in order toestablish energy control, which in turn gives rise to the experience of the fouremptinesses [of entering into the sleep state].In general it is said that the drop which supports the experience of the deepsleep state naturally resides in the heart chakra. When one utilizes this as apath one can induce an amazing experience of the clear light of sleep. Even whenit is not utilized as a path, the vital energies naturally withdraw into thisdrop when one goes to sleep. Hence if during the waking state one cultivates theability to bring the vital energies into the central channel, and when going tosleep applies the meditations described above, maintaining the visualizationsinside the central channel at the heart chakra, it becomes quite easy to bringthe energies into the central channel at the heart chakra by means of thetechniques explained earlier.The stages in which this occurs begin with the experience of a vision like thatof a mirage of shimmering water. This dissolves, and then a vision like that ofall-pervading smoke arises. That subsides, and there is an appearance of manysmall flickering lights, like fireflies in the air. That subsides, and there isan appearance of a steadily glowing light, like that of a butterlamp undisturbedby the movement of wind.That subsides, and the white drop descends. There is an appearance of whiteness,like moonlight in a clear night sky. This is the experience of \"appearance,\" andthe first \"emptiness.\" Then there is the appearance of red or reddish yellow,like sunlight in a clear sky, pervading everything. This is the emergence of theexperience of \"proximity\" and the second emptiness. Next there is a vision ofutter darkness, like that of a pitch black sky; this is the third emptiness, andthe state of \"proximate attainment.\" Prior to this one had retainedconsciousness, but here one swoons into darkness, and all awareness and memoryfade away. However, this is not a fault; for the more strongly one losesconsciousness, the better becomes the opportunity for practice. The more intenseone's vision of darkness, the more dominant will be the clear lightconsciousness when it emerges. Such is the state known as \"the great emptiness\"and \"proximate attainment.\"Finally this experience of \"proximate attainment\" subsides, and one revives fromthe depths of unconsciousness. There is a sense of clear light, like that of thesky at dawn, when there is neither sun, moon nor darkness. This is theexperience known as \"utter emptiness\" and as \"clear light.\" One places one'sawareness within it and retains it for as long as possible. Here one engages inthe methods of avoiding either slipping into the dream state or waking up [whilecultivating the clear light of sleep].I have written on these techniques separately in my commentary to the Marpatradition of Guhyasamaja.These \"four emptinesses\" are linked to the four blisses. The fourth emptinesshere is the experience of the clear light of sleep, and is concomitant with theexperience of the innate supreme ecstasy.Here there is this bliss, and also that induced by means of placing the mind inthe state of beyond conceptuality. Although the name \"bliss\" is applied equallyto both, a differentiation should be made. The former is like seeing the skyitself, whereas the latter is like seeing a mere similitude.This great ecstasy arises, and one simultaneously focuses without mentalwandering on mindfulness of the view of suchness, as explained earlier. This isthe state of consciousness so lavishly praised in highest yoga tantra as\"inseparable ecstasy and void.\" This state of being is subtle, and lesserabsorptions are easily mistaken for it. Therefore it is important to observe theexperience carefully.Some oral tradition teaching lineages here omit the work with the first threeemptinesses. Others speak of the four emptinesses, but have no clear explanationof how they are to be recognized and retained.In some oral traditions coming from Lama Ngokpa no clear method of recognizingthese experiences is given. However, [Ngokpa recommends that] these can belearned from A Compendium of Tantric Experiences (Skt. Charya melapakapradipa).53 Here that text states,The aggregates dissolve into the subtle elements. The subtle elements dissolveinto consciousness. Consciousness in turn dissolves into mind. Mind dissolvesinto unknowing.Having experienced these states, one enters into sleep. At that time,consciousness and mind dissolve into unknowing, and all memory and awareness aretemporarily lost. After that the state of unknowingness fades, and the clearlight, in nature primordial wisdom, emerges. When that [i.e., the clear light]is released, the energies move spontaneously by their natural inclination,giving rise to dreams. For as long as the mind does not waver, retain it in thesleep state, and place it in observance of the clear light of sleep.The authoritative writings of the mahasiddhas, in explaining the fouremptinesses of entering into the sleep state, advocate this approach ofrecognizing and working with the clear light of sleep. There is no moreauthoritative scriptural source for the practice. Thus one should understand itin this way.In the above passage the words \"the aggregates dissolve...\" refer to theappearance of the coarse aspects of the aggregates.The \"subtle elements dissolve...\" refers to everything dissolving into theenergies. Here, earth energies dissolve into those of water, water into fire,and fire into air. Then this dissolves into the consciousness known as \"thefirst appearance,\" which is what is meant by the words \"dissolve intoconsciousness\" [in the above passage]. This [dissolution into consciousness]refers to the first emptiness.Also, here the word \"mind\" refers to the appearance of the vision known as\"proximity.\" \"Dissolves\" refers to the moment when that consciousness [i.e.,\"appearance\"] withdraws into the mind of \"proximity.\" \"Unknowing\" refers to theexperience of \"proximate attainment.\" \"Having experienced these states...\" hasthe sense of consciously mixing or blending with these three \"emptinesses\" asthey arise at the time of entering into sleep.The process of recognizing these states is taught in A Compendium of WisdomDiamonds (Skt. Vajrajnana samucchaya)and is explained in A Compendium of TantricExperiences. My comments follow their direction.The words \"at that time...\" refer to the time of sleep. The words \"consciousnessand mind dissolve into unknowing...\" refer to one successively melting into thenext. \"After that...\" refers to the occasion following that of \"proximateattainment.\" The words \"the state of unknowingness fades...\" is in reference toawakening from the darkness of unconsciousness and is characterized by theexperience of a light like that of dawn with a clear sky. No other signs occurafter this.Here in the translation by Chak Lotsawa we see the words of the above passagerendered somewhat differently: \"The energies move spontaneously by their naturalinclination; for as long as no dreams occur....\" This is a good way ofexpressing the idea. The meaning is that after the samadhi of the clear light ofsleep is released, the mind slips out of the clear light experience. Theenergies then begin to stir of their own inclination, and one enters into thedream state. The passage, \"For as long as the mind does not waver...\" means thatuntil dreams naturally begin to arise one should remain in the clear lightabsorption.However, if the clear light of sleep cannot be retained by means of energycontrol, then one can generate samadhi at the time of going to sleep and try tofocus it on the clear light. One should keep in mind that the samadhi mustrecognize the processes of the first three \"emptinesses,\" or else the clearlight will not be recognized. Otherwise, the clear light experienced in thatsamadhi will not be the clear light of sleep, even if the samadhi is vibrantlyradiant. Moreover, as a prelude to the first \"emptiness,\" one should have beenaware of the visions of the mirage, smoke, and so forth, that indicate thewithdrawal of the elemental energies. If these are not recognized, no realclarity or focus can be established during the application.In training to work with the clear light of sleep it helps to understand theclear lights of experience and realization; and the two clear lightscharacterized as \"thin\" and \"thick.\"As for invoking the power of a vibrantly radiant non-conceptual samadhi whendreams occur, this relies on retaining the clear light of sleep. However, evenif one had learned many instructions on the methods of retaining the clear lightof sleep, these will be of no avail if one utilizes a samadhi of sleep that doesnot follow the process [of dissolutions and the experiences of the emptinesses].The mind will not be sufficiently stable to retain the application. Thereforethe instructions on how to train during both waking and sleep states must becorrectly understood. For this the principles of the practice as outlined in theexcellent writings of the Aryas, master and disciple [i.e., Nagarjuna andAryadeva], are most valuable, and in one's practice one should hold to themclosely, regarding them as deeply cherished oral instructions.If one engages the above methodology for retaining the clear light of sleep butthe movement of vital energies renders the effort unsuccessful, then one shouldengage in the manner of working within dreams as taught in wonderful detail inthe Marpa lineage of the Guhyasamaja oral instruction teachings."},{"pageContent":"THE BRANCHES OF THAT PATH, WHICH INCLUDE THE PRACTICES OF CONSCIOUSNESSTRANSFERENCE AND FORCEFUL PROJECTIONThis section of the tradition explains two techniques, namely, those forconsciousness transference, and those for forceful entry to a new residence."},{"pageContent":"CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFERENCEThis instruction on the methods for transferring consciousness to a higher realmis a unique feature of highest yoga tantra. It is taught in the Sambhuta Tantra,which is an explanatory tantra shared by both the Chakrasamvara and Hevajrasystems. It is also taught in The Diamond Sky Dancer Tantra (Skt. Vajradakatantra), which is an explanatory tantra associated exclusively withChakrasamvara. Further, we see it referred to in various root tantras, includingboth The Root Tantra of Chakrasamvara (Skt. Shri chakrasamvara mula tantra) andThe Arising of Samvara Tantra (Skt. Samvarodaya tantra), as well as The FourSeats Tantra (Skt. Shri chaturpitha tantra). We also see it referred to in TheBook of Manjushri's Direct Instructions and other such works. Those who wish tounderstand it fully would do well to read these authoritative sources and theircommentaries.The beneficial effects of this path are elucidated in The Diamond Sky DancerTantra:Killing a brahmin every day, Committing any of the five inexpiable acts,Stealing and even rape: All these karmas are purified through this path. Onesheds the clothing of guilt for evil deeds done And goes far beyond the faultsof the world.Although translated [into Tibetan] slightly differently, this same passage isalso found in both The Mystic Kiss Tantra (Skt. Chaturyogini samputa tan tra)and The Four Seats Tantra. As it is such a quintessential precept, one shouldapply oneself to it well.It is said that this path both purifies and liberates. It liberates from rebirthinto any of the three lower realms; and it purifies the mind of negative karmicseeds that ripen as lower rebirths. This is the explanation given in A Harvestof Oral Tradition Teachings.As for the time at which the actual consciousness transference should be made,this is described as follows in The Diamond Sky Dancer Tantra:Perform transference when the time comes; To do so earlier is to kill a deity.As a result of killing a deity, One will certainly bum in hell. Therefore thewise make effort To know the signs of death.This same thing is said in both The Four Seats Tantra and The Mystic Kiss Tantra. To transfer the consciousness out of the body prematurely is equivalent tosuicide; and as one is cultivating the yoga of envisioning oneself as a mandaladeity, it is equivalent to killing a tantric deity. Moreover, if one holds themantra precepts, then suicide is prohibited by the eighth root precept. Oneshould know that to transgress it will result in rebirth in the hells. Thereforeit is important to understand the correct time for the application.To know this well, one should make the effort to learn the path of reading thesigns of death. When one sees the appearance of the signs of death, and alsosees signs indicating that the methods for turning death away will not work,this is the time for the application of the actual consciousness transference.The text A Commentary to the Four Seats Tantra (Skt. Shri chaturpitha tika) byBhavabhadra states that one should train in the method at least six monthsbefore one's death. Therefore it is important to become skilled in reading thesigns indicating the unfolding of one's lifespan.Moreover, The Four Seats Tantra states,The best time to train in the transference yogas Is before one becomes afflictedwith illness.As said here, it is best to undertake the training when one is not weakened bydisease. Otherwise, once a debilitating disease has set in, it becomes difficultto effect the transfer of consciousness as desired, even if one previously hadmade some progress in the training.If one thinks to apply consciousness transference simply [as a means of endingone's life] because of terrible sufferings due to age, or unbearable pain due toan illness, this also is said to be inappropriate. Even though some traditionsdo condone the former situation, it is a great mistake.The actual teaching on the yoga of consciousness transference involves two maintrainings.The first of these is described in The Diamond Sky Dancer Tantra as follows:One purifies the limit of the residence. Having purified it, one implements thetransference. Otherwise, there will be no benefit.Here \"the limit of the residence\" refers to the human body, which is the\"residence\" within which pleasure and pain are experienced. To try and engagethe transference yogas without first having purified the body by means of theinner heat doctrine explained earlier will produce no meaningful results. Thiswas stated by Bhavabhadra in his commentary. Thus meditation on the inner heatyoga can here be regarded as a condition for success in the transference yoga.The Diamond Sky Dancer Tantra states,One ties the doors with the vase breathing technique And purifies the channelwhich is a door.The Four Seats Tantra and also the Sambhuta Tantra say much the same thing. Themeaning is that one meditates on the vase breathing technique, and by means ofit withdraws the vital energies flowing to the various doors, such as those ofthe sensory powers, redirecting these energies into the central channel.Previously the practitioners of vase breathing were described as being of threetypes: best, medium, and least qualified. It is sometimes said that even thethird of these [the least qualified] can successfully implement the transferenceyogas. This indicates a misunderstanding of the tantric treatises.Here one blocks the exit of consciousness by any gate other than the goldenaperture at the crown. The other eight gates are blocked, and consciousness isdirected to leave the body via the golden gate at the crown.To accomplish transference in such a way as to acquire the supreme basis of aknowledge holder of tantric activities, one requires the instructions asprovided in the tantric scriptures [mentioned earlier]. What is required is aqualified meditational application, as described in the tantric literature, fordirecting the movement of consciousness out of the body.There are a number of oral tradition teachings on the subject. That known as\"consciousness transference by means of the four techniques\" and also the Ngoklineage (Tib. rNgog lugs) of consciousness transference provide wonderfullydetailed presentations of the meditations involved. However, in this tradition[i.e., the Six Yogas of Naropa], the oral transmissions of most lamas presentthe instructions of consciousness transference based on oral transmission alone.I will speak in brief on what is said by them.What is the best mandala deity upon which to meditate in conjunction with theconsciousness transference yogas? Most gurus recommend that this be whatever isthe principal mandala deity one has cultivated in meditation. Alternatively, TheMystic Kiss Tan tra and The Four Seats Tantra each recommend a specific deitypractice for the techniques that they present, and one can utilize these. But towrite on these other systems here would require too many words, and therefore Iwill not do so.Here the oral tradition suggests that one should visualize oneself as one'smandala deity, and bring the vital energies into a kiss at either the secretplace chakra or the navel chakra. One then envisions the red AH-stroke syllableat the navel chakra; at the heart chakra, a dark blue HUM; and at the crownaperture, a white KSHA.-4Now one pulls up forcefully on the vital energies from below. These strike theAH-stroke syllable at the navel chakra, which then rises and strikes the HUM atthe heart. This rises and strikes the KSHA at the crown. Then the process isreversed: the HUM comes back down to the heart chakra; and the AH comes backdown to the navel chakra.Here sometimes it is said that the AH-stroke syllable dissolves into HUM [andthat into the KSHA] during the upward movement. The approach as described aboveis more effective.One should apply oneself to this training until the signs of accomplishmentmanifest, such as a small blister appearing on the crown of the head, asensation of itching, and so forth.As for the actual application [i.e., at the time of death], here some lamasrecommend that one place the body in the tsig-bu position, with the two armswrapped around the knees. As preliminaries one takes Refuge, generates thebodhimind, and then meditates upon oneself as being the mandala deity. In thespace in front of one's crown, an armspan or half an armspan in distance, onevisualizes one's root guru, in aspect inseparable from [i.e., appearing in theform of] one's meditational deity. One offers reverent prayers to him or her.Now one turns one's concentration to the three mantric syllables: the redAH-stroke at the navel chakra; blue HUM at the heart chakra; and white KSHA atthe crown. The energies are forcefully drawn up from below, causing theAH-stroke syllable to rise up the central channel from the navel chakra and meltinto the HUM at the heart chakra. One recites the mantra AH HIK several times.The HUM syllable moves up. One recites the mantra AH HIK twenty times, and itcontinues up to the throat chakra.One turns the attention to the syllable KSHA at the mouth of the Brahmaaperture, silhouetted against a background of pure white sky-like light, like anobject in a roof window. One recites AH HIK forcefully five times, and thesyllable HUM shoots out the Brahma aperture and melts into the heart of the guruinseparable from one's mandala deity. Rest awareness there in the state beyondconceptuality.[../Images/img0005.jpg]Channels, chakras and mantric syllables for the yoga of consciousnesstransferenceSuch is the process as taught by the gurus of the lineage. It accords with thebrief outline of the consciousness transference doctrine given in The Four SeatsTantra. That tantra and its commentary are authoritative sourceworks. As theypoint out, one's understanding of the technique of consciousness transference isbenefited by understanding the details of the practice, such as the seats of thetwo principal syllables mentioned, the exact site where the two syllables areplaced, the manner of placing the syllables upright and in reverse,\" theapplication of energy control and recitation at the two occasions of upwardtransference, and the special techniques of yogic application. If one canunderstand the process well and apply oneself to the train- ing,-the desiredeffects will be produced.Then there is also the oral tradition teaching for transferring consciousness torebirth in a paradise, and the technique for transferring consciousness to arebirth that can act as the basis of a supreme master of tantric activities. Forthis one must be able to apply the force of an exclusive samadhi in order toprevent consciousness from leaving the body by any of the other eight gates, anddirect it to transfer via the golden gate. If one is able to control the vitalenergies upon which the subtle consciousness rides, and thus prevent them fromflowing to the other eight gates, then one will be able to prevent theconsciousness that rides upon the energies from transferring by any of theundesirable eight \"For this one should know the key points in meditating upon mantric syllables inorder to close the gates, and also how to use the vase breathing technique inorder to withdraw the vital energies from the sensory gates. These are keypoints. Unfortunately it is rare to find a manual on the process that providesreal clarity on these issues.Numerous masters of the past have recommended that the [eight gates] be closedwith the red AH-stroke mantric syllable, like that at the navel chakra. Thisaccords with the passage in the Sambhuta Tantra wherein it is said, \"That seedsyllable is the red one.\" The same instruction is given in the scripture AHarvest of Oral Tradition Teachings, which comments that only the red AH-strokesyllable is to be used.We do see other approaches, such as, for example, using a red syllable HUM. Someteachers comment that this is based on the Four Seats Tantra, which speaks ofplacing a syllable at each of the nine gates. The syllable mentioned is a redHUM. However, this interpretation is a misunderstanding of that tantricscriptural passage."},{"pageContent":"FORCEFUL PROJECTION TO A NEW RESIDENCEThe sensory powers of the eye and so forth are likened to a house, and theentire body-base supporting the senses is likened to a town. Therefore the word\"residence\" is used.As the Prajnaparamita literature puts it, the expression \"projection intoanother residence\" is used because one projects consciousness into theundeteriorated corpse of another person; like entering into a foreign village,one projects one's consciousness into that residence. The instruction for thisprocess is a specialty of highest yoga tantra and is taught extensively in manyfemale tantras, and also is mentioned in every male tantra.What is the nature of the vessels who are able to project consciousness in thisway? What is the purpose of the practice? And what is the manner of effectingthe projection?THE VESSELS WHO ARE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH FORCEFUL PROJECTIONFor both consciousness transference and forceful projection, the person doingthe practice should have received the initiations and maintained the tantricprecepts and commitments. The reasons are much the same as with [why theseconditions should be present for training in] the generation stage yogas.With all three practices-consciousness transference, forceful projection [into acorpse], and projecting someone out of their body into one's own body-onerequires the ability to block the flow of energies by placing mantric syllablesat the gates, and also the ability to purify the gates by means of using thevase breathing technique to direct the vital energies into the central channel.And one needs the ability to control the red element, the AH-stroke syllable atthe navel chakra, by means of the inner heat yogas and to utilize it to arousethe consciousness that rides upon the subtle energies, represented by the HUM atthe heart chakra.This appears to be the intent expressed in original and commentarial tantricliterature, including the Diamond Sky Dancer Tantra, the Four Seats Tantra, andthe commentaries to them by Bhavabhadra, as well as the Mystic Kiss Tantra andits commentary, A Harvest of Oral Tradition Teachings. The ability to projectone's own or another's consciousness requires the presence of those factorsmentioned above. It also requires a particular training in energy control andthe transformative nature of the energies thus effected.To learn more on this subject, one can refer to other sources."},{"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE OF THE PRACTICEThe reasons for performing forceful projection into another residence can bemultifold. For example, there are those of inauspicious lineage who find thatthey are unable to accomplish great deeds for the benefit of the world due tophysical limitations, and thus may feel it expedient to acquire a moreappropriate body. Also, perhaps a physical illness renders one unable to benefitoneself or others, and therefore one is moved to acquire a healthy body.Similarly, one may be afflicted by old age and thus be moved to acquire ayouthful body.For these and similar reasons the technique of \"forceful projection into anotherresidence\" is utilized.THE MANNER OF EFFECTING THE PROJECTIONThe lineage gurus have outlined three modes of applying the yoga of forcefulprojection.In the first of these the practitioner must have acquired control over thesubtle levels of energy and consciousness. He must have a vision of greatlybenefiting others in this lifetime, and be moved by immeasurable compassion forall living beings. On that basis he implements the yoga of forceful projectioninto another residence.With an attendant he takes up the practice in a solitary place, avoids alldistracting activities, prepares an altar to the mandala deities, arrangesofferings, and sets the limits of the retreat place.In front of his meditation seat he constructs a mandala on a black base, andstands a human skull-cup at its center, the syllable HUM clearly written in itwith chalk.Within the sphere of envisioning himself as the mandala deity, he offers theseven-limbed devotion and then turns his meditation to the mantric syllable HUMat his heart. When the breath passes exclusively through the right nostril heimagines the syllable HUM at the heart being projected out with the flowingairs. This leaves by the right nostril and melts into the HUM in the skull cup.One does not inhale the airs again, but retains the exhalation. When one can nolonger retain the exhalation, one slowly inhales the airs again. The process ofexhalation is then repeated.After persisting in this method for some time, signs of progress will begin tomanifest. For example, the skull cup will shake, move or jump around on themandala table of its own accord.To practice the technique one first acquires a fresh, undisintegrated humancorpse of a person who did not die from serious wounds or a debilitatingillness. Alternatively, the body of certain animals can be used for thetraining.One washes the corpse with fresh water, adorns it with beautiful ornaments, andplaces it in the crossed-legged posture on the mandala platform that wasconstructed earlier. One visualizes the mantric syllable HUM, the support ofconsciousness, at both one's own heart and that of the corpse. One breathes outthe syllable HUM at one's heart; it exits via the right nostril, and enters thebody of the corpse via the left nostril, melting into the HUM at its heart. Onerepeats this process over and over, until eventually the corpse begins tobreathe and become animated. These are signs that the ability to effect thepractice has been acquired, and one is at the threshold of the real practice.When one is ready for the actual application, one releases the retreat limitsthat had been set and searches for a human corpse having the prerequisite signs.As before, one places it on the mandala platform, the face pointing towardoneself. It is decorated with ornaments and so forth. One then generates thevision of oneself as the mandala deity, leaves behind all thoughts of attachmentto the ordinary physical body, generates the vision of the illusory nature ofall phenomena that appear in the world, and transcends all instincts ofconceiving the world as ordinary. Within this sphere one makes the sacrificialtorma offering (Tib. gtor ma) to the gurus and the Dharma Protectors, and sendsout supplications that hindrances may not arise.Now one visualizes oneself and the corpse as being tantric deities, a mantricsyllable HUM at the heart of each. One faces the corpse squarely and breathesout, with the airs passing through the right nostril. The HUM at one's heartexits one's body via the right nostril and enters into the body of the corpsevia its left nostril. The forces of subtle energies and mind are brought intoplay in the process of moving the syllable HUM, and the airs are expelledforcefully. Eventually the corpse will be resuscitated and will begin tobreathe.When this happens, one has a beautiful friend offer it appropriate food and tendto it 57 For half a month it is kept hidden inside; and until this new\"residence\" becomes steady, one also keeps one's old body hidden inside the hut.Then one can cremate the old body in a tantric fire ritual, have the ashes mixedwith clay and pressed into holy images, and so forth, in order to show respectto it for the kind service that it had rendered to one. One then takes up one'snew life in the newly acquired body, and performs great deeds for the benefit ofliving beings.This is the method of \"forceful projection into another residence\" as taught bythe lineage gurus. Different [Indian] tantric scriptures and treatises teachsimilar methods, without the need for all the details found in the oraltradition described above.A question of ethics becomes relevant in the application of these doctrines,similar to that which arose in the doctrine of consciousness transference,wherein it was said that to project consciousness out of one's body prematurelyis equal to killing a deity or human. Here, however, heavy language of thisnature is not used. There is no question of killing or suicide, for [unlike inconsciousness transference, here] one does not actually die. It is not likecausing oneself to die prematurely, as in an early application of consciousnesstransference, and thus the parallel cannot be drawn. Here the \"death\" that isexperienced by the yogi or yogini is not a complete death with all the featuresof a conventional passing. And even though there is forceful projection intoanother \"residence,\" there is no rebirth in the conventional sense of being bornfrom one of the four types of birth, such as from the womb, from an egg, and soforth. Thus there is no fully characterized rebirth. Furthermore, although theperiod between the time that consciousness is projected out of one's body untilit has entered into the new body may be termed an in-between state [and thus abardo], it is not a fully characterized bardo of becoming. Moreover, in ordinarydeath and rebirth there is a total loss of memory of the past life; here thereis none of this memory loss.If one wishes to understand the principles of this extraordinary practice morefully, they are to be found in the teachings of the Guhyasamaja oraltransmission teaching known as the \"Oral Tradition of the Body-Form of GloriousGuhyasamaja\" (Tib. Pal 'dus pa'i sku lus kyi man ngag).Although there are said to be traditions of both forcefully projecting one's ownconsciousness into another residence [as described above], and forcefullyprojecting the consciousness of someone else into one's own body [in order tooffer it to them], this second tradition is not publicly taught by the gurus.Therefore I will not write of it here."},{"pageContent":"THE METHODS AND ACTIVITIES FOR ENHANCING THE PATHTo accomplish enlightenment in this lifetime one must engage in the specialtantric activities for enhancing the path. Here there are those tantricactivities associated with the generation stage yogas, and those associated withthe completion stage yogas. The Clear Lamp (Skt. Pradipoddyotana) speaks of theactivities on both of these stages as being of three types, simply called \"withembellishment,\" \"without embellishment,\" and \"utterly without embellishment.\"\"The tone of the term \"tantric activities\" here is that one enters the door ofthoroughly understanding the self-nature principle, and through it utilizes theobjects of sensuality in general, and a wisdom consort in particular. In thisway there arises a wondrous realization of suchness.Hence \"activity utterly without embellishment\" refers to the wisdom consort, thejnanamudra that is the seal of wisdom, the knowledge lady.As for the other two of the three [\"with embellishment\" and \"withoutembellishment\"], they involve the sensual karmamudra, or activities utilizing anactual sexual partner.The manner of implementing these is also of three types: the expanded practice,which includes singing, dancing, and so forth; the medium version, in whichthese are abbreviated; and the third mode, in which one dispenses with allexternal embellishments.\"The time for these tantric activities is also threefold: when one is attemptingto manifest the illusory body for the first time; when the illusory body hasbeen achieved and one is attempting to train in the clear light yogas; and whenthe great union state of a trainee has been attained and one is attempting tomaster the yogas of the great union beyond training.These methods are taught because during these phases in the training onerequires an oral tradition teaching containing the complete details of thepractice. I have mentioned them in brief merely in order to lay instincts forthe practice [on the mindstreams of the readers]. To address these issues herewould require too many words. Those who want to know more on the subject shouldsearch the oral tradition teachings on the Guhyasamaja Tantra."},{"pageContent":"THE MANNER OF ACTUALIZING THE RESULTSAfter the stage of the great union of a trainee has been achieved one entersinto meditation on the clear light, through which all instincts of the confusedstate of grasping at duality are washed away. Then at the time of finallymanifesting the Dharmakaya, the illusory body of the practitioner on the stageof the great union of a trainee utterly transforms and becomes an illusory bodyof the great union beyond training. That illusory body will not falter for aslong as samsara exists.At that point the clear light as an object possessing the two pure qualitiesbecomes the Uncompounded Dharmakaya. The clear light as subject [i.e., as theperceiving mind] becomes what is known as the Jnana Dharmakaya, or Wisdom TruthBody, and as the Mahasukhakaya, or \"Great Ecstasy Body.\"The support of that [Dharmakaya state] is the Rupakaya, created solely from [themost subtle levels of] energy and mind of the formaspect of the being. This isthe Sambhogakaya.These two \"bodies\"-the Dharmakaya [Truth Body] and Rupakaya [Form Body]-bothhave the same essential natures, but dramatically distinct existentialpresences. Therefore sometimes we see the Rupakaya also referred to as the \"Bodyof Non-dual Wisdom.\"[The last expression above has given rise to some misinterpretations. Forexample,] we see it said that the Rupakaya is not collected by the stream ofbeing of the person accomplishing buddhahood, but rather is collected by thestream of being of those to be trained. Others speak of the Rupakaya being otherthan mind, and formed from physical matter. Then there is the saying that at thetime of resultant buddhahood there is no primordial wisdom. None of this isespecially useful.Here this illusory body of the stage of the great union transforms into theNirmanakaya, and is able to send forth countless emanations."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE[Of the two fundamental texts that serve as the basis of the Six Yogas ofNaropa,] here there is The Early Compendium Root Text (Tib. Ka dpe rtsa ba'isdom snga ma), and The Later Compendium Root Text (Tib. Ka dpe rtsa ba'i sdomphyi ma). It seems that there are two internal contradictions with the formertext. Some traditions purport that the second one was compiled by Lama Marpahimself. There is also a commentary to the oral instruction tradition of theGuhyasamaja Tantra that is attributed to Lama Marpa. We see such statementsmade, but it is difficult to ascertain their veracity.Another work attributed to Lama Marpa is entitled Eight Instructions in Verseand Prose (Tib. Tshig rkang brgyad ma), which blends verse and prose in itspresentation. Then there is The Vajra Song of the Six Dharmas (Tib. Chos drugrdo rje'i mgur). However, these two are only intended to plant the seeds of theoral tradition teachings, and are too terse to do much more than that.There are also several oral traditions of the six yogas of Naropa based onrevealed \"treasure texts\" that have appeared. These do not inspire muchconfidence.60Marpa transmitted his lineage [of the Six Yogas of Naropa] to three of hisdisciples: Ngokton, Tsurton, and Milarepa. In turn, Milarepa transmitted hislineages to two main disciples: Chojey Gampopa and Rechungpa. The lineagedescending from Gampopa multiplied into many different forms, each with its ownspecialty, uniqueness and individual views on the different practices. Igathered the essence of all of these through personal effort and experience.The instruction on the inner heat yoga comes to us through Tilopa, who commentedthat this was the transmission of the mahasiddha Krishnacharya, also known [toTibetans] as Lobpon Acharyapa (Tib. sLob dpon a tsar ya pa). Here thesepreviously existent oral traditions are used as the basis. This is enriched andclarified in reference to The Sambhuta Drop of Springtime (Skt. Samputa tilaka)and also Acharya Krishnacharya's The Drop of Springtime (Skt. Vasanta tilaka).The illusory body and the clear light doctrines are derived from the Guhyasamajaoral tradition, as taught by the Indian mahasiddha Jnanagarbha and received [byMarpa directly from him]. Thus these are based on the Guhyasamaja Tantra. Herethe Marpa tradition of the Guhyasamaja oral instruction transmission has beenused as the basis, with references to the Guhyasamaja cycle of the Aryas, Fatherand Sons [i.e., \"The Arya Cycle of Guhyasamaja Doctrines\"J.The practices of consciousness transference and forceful projection to a newresidence are based on the Four Seats Tantra. In addition, one should understandthat they are associated with numerous other tantric traditions, including theSambhuta Tantra, the Vajradaka Tantra, and so forth. I have explained these twoin a manner affording easy understanding. As these teachings are based on thesereliable sources, one should have confidence in them.Oh hark!The incomparable Buddha Shakyamuni, lord of sages, Taught the holy Dharma forthe benefit of living beings. Supreme of his teachings are those of highest yogatantra, Both the female tantras and the male tantras.From the female tantras [i.e., Hevajra and Chakrasamvara] Comes the teaching onthe inner heat doctrine, chandali, A method for bringing the subtle energiesunder control And arousing the innate wisdom.With this as the basis one takes up the practice Of the illusory body and clearlight doctrines That emanate from the Guhyasamaja Tantra, And the doctrines ofconsciousness transference And forceful projection to another residence Thatemanate from the Shri Chaturpitha Tantra.Based on those sources there arose This tradition from the mahasiddhas Tilopaand Naropa, Famed as \"the Six Yogas of Naropa.\"Countless practitioners here in this land of snows Have delighted in thisfestival of profound tantric endeavor, A deeply cherished and precious oraltradition legacy.By the force of great merits from previous lives, Miwang Drakpa became famedthroughout this domain As a chieftain dedicated to the Six Yogas tradition; Hewears the Three jewels as his crown ornaments. And Chojey Sonam, whose wisdompulsates With having read the sacred scriptures in depth, and who Has becomerich in profound spiritual realization. These two offered me a mandala decoratedwith jewels And requested me to write this treatise. Moreover, these days thereare many practitioners With great interest in this sublime path; Therefore,thinking that it may be of benefit to some, I made the effort and composed thiswork.It contains clear instructions on the stages of meditation in this path, A clearand critical guide to the principles in the trainings, And references to theauthoritative tantras and commentaries; These are the three features withinwhich it is set.The essential meanings of the profound teachings are hard to perceive Andordinary beings cannot easily penetrate them. Hence I request the dakas anddakinis To be patient with any faults [of the book].Through any merits resulting from this composition, May all beings enter intopeerless tantric practice; And may this sublime tradition [known as the SixYogas of Naropa] prosper and grow."},{"pageContent":"THE COLOPHONThis treatise on the profound path of the Six Yogas of Naropa, entitled A Bookof Three Inspirations, was written at the repeated requests of the lordly MiwangDrakpa Gyaltsen and Chojey Sonam Gyaltsen, who asked for a work that wouldclarify the key points in the inner heat yogas, as well as briefly touch uponthe common and exclusive distinctions in the trainings.b'Even though this tradition has inspired extraordinary activities in this part ofthe world over the past generations, these days the practice of it is notparticularly widespread. Yet there are many people with interest in it, andtherefore I thought that perhaps it may be useful to accept the request.It was composed by a Buddhist monk who had heard many teachings, Lobzang Drakpaof the East, while residing in Ganden Namgyal Ling Monastery on Nomad Mountain.The scribe was Kazhipa Rinchen Pal.May goodness increase in the world."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX IVAJRASATTVA MEDITATION AND MANTRARECITATIONFROM TSONGKHAPA'S A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONSOne begins the meditation session by blending deeply into one's mindstreamthoughts of the Three Jewels of Refuge, until a strong sense of refuge arises.Then one thinks to oneself, \"Just as I myself am drowning in the ocean ofsamsara, so are all other sentient beings. Moreover, all of them have been amother to me in many of my previous lives, and on those occasions showed megreat kindness, benefiting me in countless ways and protecting me from harm.\"Reflect in this way, and give rise to a consistent attitude to repay allsentient beings for the kindnesses they have thus shown to you.Next contemplate the ways in which sentient beings are deprived of happiness andare afflicted with suffering. Give rise to the strong aspiration to establishthem in every happiness and to free them from every suffering.Then one asks oneself, \"And just who has the ability to completely accomplishthese two aims?\" The answer is that only a completely enlightened being, abuddha, can do so.One meditates like this until a strong sense of the bodhimind arises, which isthe experience of universal responsibility that aspires to accomplish buddhahoodas a means of benefiting all living beings.Like that, one should repeatedly stabilize the decision to rely upon the path bythinking that one must accomplish enlightenment for the benefit of all livingbeings.The Essential Ornament (Skt. Hridaya alamkara) states,The embodiment of all the buddhas Appears upon seats of a white lotus and moonAs Vajrasattva, adorned with vajra, bell and ornaments. Visualize in this way.The hundred-syllable mantra is recited twenty-one times. Through the blessingpower of this recitation, The karmic stains of failings are cleansed And theincreasing power of negative karma will not manifest.This has been said by the mahasiddhas. Also, practice this mantra between yogasessions; And if one can complete 100,000 mantra recitations, One will become innature utterly purified.As said above, if one relies upon the meditation and mantra recitation focusingupon Vajrasattva, repeating the hundred-syllable Vajrasattva mantra twenty-onetimes [at the beginning of each yoga session], the increasing power of negativekarmic forces created by spiritual failings and so forth will no longer be ableto manifest and multiply.Moreover, if one can recite the hundred-syllable mantra 100,000 times, one willaccomplish utter purification of all spiritual faults. This has been said bymany great masters of the past.Therefore, one should undertake this practice with confidence. As theVajrasattva meditation and mantra recitation fulfills such sublime purposes, oneshould engage in it with enthusiasm.The visualization to be pursued is as follows.Upon one's head appears a white syllable PAM. This becomes a white lotus, with asyllable AH resting above it. This syllable transforms into a moon disk, thesyllable HUM resting above it. HUM transforms into a white, five-pronged vajra,with a syllable HUM marking its center.Lights go out from this, accomplish the two purposes [of oneself and others],and then are reabsorbed [into the vajra and HUM]. This utterly transforms, andVajrasattva instantly appears [upon the lotus and moon seats], his body white incolor, holding a vajra in his right hand and a bell in his left, the consortwhite Vajra Bhagavati embracing him, her hands holding a curved knife and a cupmade of a human skull.He is adorned by the precious ornaments, and his body possesses the marks andsigns of perfection. He is seated in the vajra posture [i.e., legs folded overone another], and a white syllable HUM stands upon a moon disk at his heart.[This is the Samayasattva, or Symbolic Being.]Lights emanate forth from the HUM at his heart, summoning forth theJnanasattvas, or Wisdom Beings. They appear in the same form as he. One makesdevotional offerings to them and recites the mantra JAH HUM BAM HOH, summoningthem to, dissolving them into, merging them with and making them inseparablefrom him.Again lights are sent forth from the syllable HUM at his heart. They summon theInitiation Deities. One makes devotional offerings to them, and requests them,\"0 Tathagatas, You Gone to Suchness, please bestow empowerment.\"The Tathagatas think to bestow empowerment. Their consorts hold up jewelledvases filled with wisdom empowerment nectars, and sing the auspicious verse,[../Images/page0232_0000.svg]Saying this, they pour forth wisdom nectars from their vases. The body [ofVajrasattva visualized above the crown of one's head], is filled. BuddhaAkshobya appears as [Vajrasattva's] crown ornament.One now assumes a devotional posture of body, speech and mind, and makes therequest, \"0 Bhagavan Vajrasattva, please bless me to purify all negative karmicseeds, spiritual obscurations, and degenerated precepts accumulated by myselfand others.\"When this supplication has been made, lights emanate forth from the syllable HUMat his heart. They touch all living beings, purifying them of negative karmicinstincts, spiritual obscurations, and weakening of precepts.The lights then make devotional offerings to the buddhas and bodhisattvas of theten directions, which cause the transformative energies of body, speech, mind,realizations and activity power of all enlightened beings to manifest as light.This light then flows into the syllable HUM at Vajrasattva's heart. Onecontemplates that in this way [the visualized] Vajrasattva becomes brilliantlyradiant and imbued with every perfection and power.One now concentrates on the HUM at Vajrasattva's heart. It is encircled by thehundred-syllable mantra:OM VAIRA HERUKA SAMAYA / MANUPALAYA / HERUKA TVENOTAPISHTHA / DRIDHO MEBHAVA /SUTOSITYO MEBHAVA / SUPOSITYO MEBHAVA / ANURAKTO MEBHAVA / SARVA SIDDHIMEPRAYACHHA/SARVA KARMA SUCHAME /CHHITAM SHRI YAM / KURU HUM/ HA HA HA HA HOHBHAGAVAN / VAIRA HERUKA MAME MUCHA / HERUKA BHAVA / MAHA SAMAYA SATTVA AH HUMPHATOne visualizes the hundred-syllable mantra as surrounding the seed syllable[HUM] in this way. Lights emanate from the mantric syllables, purify livingbeings of negative karmic instincts and spiritual obscurations, and makeinconceivably vast offerings to the buddhas and bodhisattvas. The transformativeblessing powers of the body, speech and mind of the buddhas and bodhisattvas aredrawn forth, and are absorbed into the mantric syllables.A stream of white nectars flows forth from the mantric seeds. They flowdownward, and exit the bodies of Vajrasattva and Consort from the place of theirsexual union. They come to the crown of one's head, where they flow into one'sbody via the Brahma aperture. All negative karmic instincts and obscurationscollected by means of activities of body, speech and mind are expelled, and arevisualized as leaving one's body via the bodily apertures and pores, in the formof thick black slime. One is purified of all negative karma and obscurations,and one's body becomes filled with a radiantly white stream of wisdom nectars.Both oneself and all other living beings are infused with every spiritualknowledge and excellence. Meditate in this way as you recite the mantra.At the conclusion of the meditation session apply the four purification forces(such as acknowledging one's shortcomings and failings, generating remorse atone's failures, and so forth). Then contemplate the non-truly-existent, voidnessnature of the three circles of negative karma and obscurations: how the negativekarma and obscurations themselves, oneself as the perpetrator and experiencer ofthem, and the act of perpetrating and experiencing them, all have no real orinherent existence. Conclude the meditation session with the verse,[../Images/page0234_0000.svg]Vajrasattva replies, \"Child of good character, your negative karmic instincts,spiritual obscurations and failures in training are all now purified.\"Having said this, he dissolves into one's body. Meditate that in this way one'sbody, speech and mind become inseparable from the body, speech and mind ofVajrasattva.Conclude the session by dedicating the merit of the practice and offeringauspicious prayers."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX IIESTABLISHING BLESSING POWERS BYMEDITATING UPON GURU YOGAFROM TSONGKHAPA'S A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONSThis is explained under two headings: meditating upon the guru as a field ofmerit; and offering devotions and prayers.The first of these is done as follows. One visualizes that in the space in frontof oneself is a jeweled throne supported by lions. It bears a seat made of alotus and a sun disk. Upon that sits one's own guru. In nature he is one's guru,but in appearance he resembles Buddha Vajradhara, lord of the sixth buddhafamily, his body blue in color. His two hands, with a vajra in the right and abell in the left, embrace a consort who resembles him. His upper and lower robesare made of celestial silks, and he is adorned with the jewel ornaments. Hislegs are crossed in the vajra posture, and he is ablaze with the lights of fivecolors.Meditating in this way, envision that at his crown chakra the white syllable OMrests upon a moon disk; at his throat chakra the red syllable AH rests upon alotus; and at his heart chakra the blue syllable HUM rests upon a sun disk. Allthree syllables are ablaze with lights.A great radiance emanates forth from the syllable HUM, summoning forth BuddhaVajradhara, the assembly of lineage gurus, and the host of meditational mandaladeities. They all dissolve into the Buddha Vajradhara visualized in front.As is said in The Arising of Samvara Tantra,The guru is the Buddha, the guru is the Dharma, And likewise the guru is theSangha.In this way meditate that the guru is the embodiment of all Three Jewels ofRefuge.Also The Five Stages states,The self-realized Buddha Is a singularly super divinity. But one's own tantricmaster is even greater, For it is he or she who gives one the oraltransmissions.As said above, one should think that the guru who is one's personal field ofmerit and who gives one the tantric teachings is even greater than BuddhaVajradhara himself.Also, The Book of Manjushri's Direct Instruction states,In sum, when the meaningful is being undertaken, I shall reside within thatbody. Thus another shall accept the devotion of the practice. By that devotionand the joy it produces, Karmic obscurations will be purified from themindstream.As said here, sometimes when teacher and disciples gather for the purpose oftransmitting the oral traditions, the buddhas themselves come, enter into theteacher's body, and accept the devotion themselves. This spontaneously givesrise to great joy in the minds of the disciples.When on other occasions one practices devotion [i.e., when not in the presenceof the guru], although one gains the merit of offering devotion to the buddhas,it is not as sure that the buddhas will manifest to accept it directly, and thusthe level of the merit is not as certain. Thus one can have confidence that theguru is the unsurpassed field of merit.Hence one should regard the guru as an embodiment of all the Tathagatas. Resolveto transcend the mind that sees faults in the guru, and cultivate the habit ofappreciating the guru's realizations. From within this sphere of awareness,engage in acts of devotion.If one relates to the guru on the basis of looking for faults in him or her, onemerely creates obstacles to the accomplishment of the siddhis. Conversely, ifone relates to the spiritual master on the basis of looking for his or herrealizations, one quickly achieves the siddhis.Therefore one should cultivate the ways of relating to the guru on the basis ofpositive energy, being mindful of his or her kindness, and treating him or herwith great respect.OFFERING DEVOTIONS AND PRAYERSTHE FIVE STAGES STATES,Leave behind all ordinary devotion And take up devotion to the guru; For bypleasing the guru one attains The supreme wisdom of omniscient buddhahood.Devoting oneself to the master who teaches highest tantra While seeing him as atantric buddha in human form: What is the limit of the merit thus accrued? Whatpath is there that is less austere?As said here, the supreme devotion is devotion to the guru. Generate intenseawareness of this dynamic, and devote yourself accordingly to your tantricteacher.One such devotional exercise is that of offering the mandala symbolic of theuniverse.Here one takes a base made of anything from simple clay to the most ornatejewelled materials, and consecrates it with blessed cow products, perfumedwaters, and the five nectars. One begins with the mantra OM VAJRA BHUMI AH HUM,and while saying it, pours flower petals (or whatever substances are being used,such as grains, sand, jewels, etc.) over the base, while reciting, \"Here is thegreat powerful golden earth.\"Then with the mantra OM VAJRA REKHE AH HUM one pours more flower petals, thistime in a circle around the outer circumference of the base, while reciting,\"Here is the surrounding iron fence.\" Next one takes a handful of flower petalsconsecrated with perfumes and the five nectars, and pours them into the centerof the base, reciting, \"and here is the great Mount Meru.\"One then pours a handful of flower petals successively into the eastern,southern, western and northern directions, while reciting, \"In the east is thecontinent Lupakpo, in the south Jambuling, in the west Balangcho, and in thenorth Draminyan.\"Now one places a handful to the right and left of each of these continents inorder to symbolize the subcontinents, beginning with the east and movingclockwise as above. Thus one does so with the eastern continent, while recitingthe names of the two eastern subcontinents Lu and Lupak; then to the right andleft of the southern continent, Ngayab and Ngayabzhan; next to the right andleft of the western continent while reciting \"Yodan and Lamchokdro\"; and to theright and left of the northern continent while reciting \"Draminyan and DraminyanKyida.\"Then one pours a handful on top of the continents, first to the east, reciting\"the precious elephant\"; then above the south while reciting \"the preciouslord\"; above the west while reciting \"the precious supreme horse\"; above thenorth while reciting \"the precious queen\"; above the southeast while reciting\"the precious warrior\"; above the southwest while reciting \"the precious wheel\";above the northwest while reciting \"the precious jewel\"; and above the northeastwhile reciting \"the precious treasure.\" Then to the east of the center one poursa handful of flowers, reciting, \"the sun\"; and to the west of the center,reciting, \"the moon.\"In this way one creates a symbolic universe with all auspicious things in it,visualizing it as being made of various precious gems. One holds it up andoffers it to the guru, while reciting the following words: \"I send forth as anoffering in the manner exemplified by the great bodhisattva Samantabhadra thissymbolic universe made of precious gems, together with the mass of meritoriousenergy collected in the past, present and future by myself and all other livingbeings through our actions of body, speech and mind. All of this I envisionwithin my mind and offer to my gurus, meditational deities, and the forces ofspiritual refuge. Accept it out of your compassion, and bestow waves ofinspiring power upon me.\"Thus one offers the mandala to the guru. Here the flower petals (or whateversubstances) that are used are the outer offering; and the five nectars withwhich these are anointed are the inner offering. One should also make the secretoffering, chant verses of praise, and in the presence of the visualized assemblyrenew whatever general and particular pledges of practice one has previouslyadopted.Then with great reverence one should chant several prayers requesting blessingsto inspire one to quickly generate within one's mindstream the realizations ofthe actual experience of the stages of the ordinary [i.e., general Mahayana] andextraordinary [i.e., Vajrayana] paths, as well as to pacify adverse conditionsand create conducive conditions to accomplishing these stages of realization.The guru is pleased at one's efforts. From his three points [i.e., forehead,throat and heart] respectively emanate forth white, red and blue lights. Theseenter into one's own three points, and one's body becomes completely filled withthem. One is purified of all negative karmic seeds that were collected by meansof body, speech and mind, and receives the first three empowerments, known bythe names \"vase,\" \"secret\" and \"wisdom awareness.\" The three realizationsthoseof vajra body, vajra speech and vajra mind-successively are induced. Onemeditates in this way.Now a great mass of multicolored lights emanate from all [three] sites of theguru's body. They enter one's body via all [three] of one's sites. The mostsubtle obscurations generated by means of body, speech and mind aresimultaneously purified. One receives the fourth empowerment, known as \"theinitiation of highest significance.\" The realizations of the inseparable threevajras are induced.Here the three mantric syllables symbolize the three vajras [i.e., the perfectedstates of body, speech and mind]. Just as the lights from these syllables arevisualized as purifying the obscurations of body, speech and mind, theempowerments known as vase, secret and wisdom awareness purify these three typesof karmic stains. Similarly the fourth empowerment, known as \"the empowerment ofhighest significance,\" purifies the obscurations to realizing the inseparablenature of the three vajras.The process explained above is merely a symbolic method of achieving the fourempowerments, and not the actual obtaining of the empowerments.One then brings the guru visualized in front to the space above one's head,either by mantra and mudra, or else simply by visualizing the process. He or shethen dissolves into one's body, and one meditates that one's body, speech andmind become inseparable in nature from the holy body, speech and mind of theguru. One recites the hundred syllable mantra [of Vajrasattva, as outlinedearlier].This practice should be done between yoga sessions, and at the beginning of eachsession."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARYSANSKRIT AND TIBETAN NAMES AND TERMSSANSKRIT[../Images/img0006.jpg][../Images/page0242_0000.svg] [../Images/page0243_0000.svg][../Images/page0244_0000.svg] [../Images/page0245_0000.svg]TIBETAN[../Images/img0007.jpg][../Images/page0246_0000.svg] [../Images/page0247_0000.svg][../Images/page0248_0000.svg] [../Images/page0249_0000.svg]"},{"pageContent":"NOTESINTRODUCTION1. Sutras, tantras and shastras: The first of these refers to the opendiscourses of the Buddha, which, with the exception of the Vinaya sutra, weretransmitted orally for several centuries before being written down. The secondrefers to the esoteric teachings given by the Buddha in mystical states. Thethird refers to the treatises and commentaries composed by later Indian masters.The first two categories of scriptures are contained in the Tibetan canonicalcollection known as the Kangyur (Tib. bKa' 'gyur); the third comprises theTibetan canonical collection known as the Tangyur (bsTan 'gyur).2. The Three Great Dharma Kings: Songtsen Gampo (Tib. Srong btsan sgam po), whoin the mid-seventh century made Buddhism the national religion of Tibet; TrisongDeutsen (Tib. Khri srong deu btsan), who in the mid-eighth century brought GuruPadmasambhava to Tibet and established the country's first fullfledgedmonastery, in addition to overseeing much translation work; and, half a centurylater, Tri Ralpachen (Khri Rai pa can), who patronized the systematic overhauland standardization of all earlier translations, thus completing the work of thefirst two.All three of these Great Dharma Kings are considered to be previous incarnationsof the being who was to become the First Dalai Lama.3. There is a tendency these days to speak of the Nyingma as though it were oneschool; prior to 1959 most Nyingma monasteries were independent, and there wasnever one \"head lama\" of the Nyingmapa, as opposed to the New Schools, each ofwhich had its own patriarch. Each of the twelve Kargyupa schools, for example,had its own head lama.4. Goe Lotsawa's (Tib. 'Gos lo tsa wa) The Blue Annals (Tib. Deb Cher sngon po),translated by George Roerich with the assistance of Gendun Chopel (Calcutta,1949), presents the most historically accurate analysis of the life of Marpaavailable in English. However, The Life of Marpa the Translator (Boulder:Prajna, 1982), prepared by the meticulous Nalanda Translation Committee underthe direction of Chogyam Trungpa from the sixteenth-century Tibetan text ofTsangnyon Heruka (Tib. Tsangs snyon he ru ka; b. 1452), provides a moreromanticized and more readable account. Tsangnyon's work is hagiography, andthus is more concerned with providing an inspiring story than with historicalprecision.This latter text portrays Marpa as having been sent by Naropa to study withJnanagarbha, Maitripa and the mahasiddha Kukuripa. Goe Lotsawa does not confirmthis, and instead suggests he met his other masters quite independently ofNaropa.The translators of The Blue Annals imply that Jnanagarbha and Kukuripa are infact one and the same person (page 400).5. One usually sees the group names of these four older and eight youngerKargyupa sub-sects translated as \"four greater\" and \"eight lesser.\" Although theTibetan terms the and chung can sometimes have this meaning, usually they donot. In this context translating them as \"great\" and \"small\" is distinctlymisleading. For instance, the Drikung Kargyu, one of the eight younger schools,was probably larger than all four older schools combined. In fact, two of thefour older sects barely survived into the twentieth century.6. For a discussion of his importance to the Tibetan understanding of theKalachakra tantric tradition, see my The Practice of Kalachakra (Ithaca: SnowLion Publications, 1991).7. Herbert Guenther's The Life and Teachings of Naropa (London: OxfordUniversity Press, 1963) is based on his translation of the Tibetan biographycomposed by Lhatsun Rinchen Namgyal (Tib. IHa btsun rin Chen mam rgyal), adirect disciple of Tsangnyon Heruka, the author of the biography of Marpamentioned in note 4 above. It is in the same genre, and aims more at providingexciting and inspirational reading rather than giving \"factual\" history. Thisadds to its charm rather than detracts from it.8. No major biography of Tilopa has been translated, although small accounts aregiven in several sources. My favorite is to be found in The Great Kagyu Mastersby Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1990).9. See Selected Works of the Dalai Lama II: The Tantric Yogas of Sister Niguma(Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1984).10. It is interesting that Tsongkhapa does not elaborate on the Vajra Song ofthe Six Yogas, which he mentions in his Epilogue and to which Jey Sherab Gyatsoreferred in the quotation given on page 22. I am not sure exactly what text thisis. It may be Tilopa's Oral Instruction on the Six Doctrines (Tib. Chos drug giman ngag) and I have listed it as such in the bibliography. However, it alsocould refer to Naropa's Whispered Instruction of the Six Dharmas (Tib. Chos drugsnyan rgyud), which is not included in the Peking Tangyur but is to be found inthe Dergey Tangyur. Tsongkhapa mentions the title only as The Vajra Song of theSix Yogas (Chos drug rdo rje mgur), and there is no direct equivalent of this.Moreover, he does not quote or discuss the text, other than saying that it is\"only intended to plant the seeds of the oral tradition teaching\" and also thatit is \"too terse to do much more than that.\" I include both Tilopa's andNaropa's texts in Readings on the Six Yogas of Naropa (Ithaca: Snow LionPublications, forthcoming).11. Translated in my study of the Thirteenth's life and teachings, Path of theBodhisattva Warrior (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1988).12. Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Cultivating a Daily Meditation(Dharamsala: Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, 1991).13. Unfortunately Perna Karpo does not describe the more extensive numbers ofthe physical exercises, such as the twenty or fifty, nor give a literary sourcefor them. See Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, translated by Lama KaziDawaSamdup and W. Y. Evans-Wentz (London: Oxford University Press, 1935), p.207.14. Tummo, or inner heat (Skt. chandali; Tib. gtum mo) is rendered by severalmodem translators as \"the Fierce Woman.\" Although mo is a female suffix and gtumhas a sense of both fierceness and heat about it, the English words \"fiercewoman\" would most directly be re-translated back into Tibetan as kyemen drakpo(Tib. skyes dman drag po), and if presented to any Tibetan lama as an equivalentof tummo would certainly bring a chuckle from his lips. It is a bit liketranslating the French la table as Miss Flat-top.There is, of course, a tradition of representing the different chakras bydakinis. Similarly, in the body mandala practices of the Chakrasamvara systemsone visualizes tantric deities at each of the main bodily sites, the variousbodily energies are symbolized by deities, and so forth.15. I use this translation of the Tibetan term a thung (literally \"the shortAH\") as a tribute to the late Chogyam Trungpa Rinpochey, who used it in his workon the life of Marpa mentioned above. For all his eccentricities and the tragicend to his life-he died of alcoholism-Trungpa was one of the great lamas of ourtime in terms of communicating the essential sense of Tibetan Buddhism toWestern culture.16. Dr. Herbert Benson's research with Tibetan yogis is partially documented inhis book Beyond the Relaxation Response (New York: Times Books, 1984). A videoof his project was also made.17. I say this because it was evident at a discourse I attended on the variousmudra practices in 1974 from a highly qualified and traditional Gelukpa monk. AnItalian monk asked, \"Does a monk who wishes to practice karmamudra have todisrobe in order to do so?\" The lama laughed and replied, \"No. He just becomesan especially good monk.\"18. The First Dalai Lama's treatise, Notes on the Two Yogic Stages of GloriousKalachakra (Tib. dPal dus kyi 'khor lo'i rim pa gnyis pa'i zin bris), istranslated in my book on the Kalachakra tantric system, The Practice ofKalachakra (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1991), which includes translationsof eight different Tibetan texts on various aspects of the Kalachakra tradition.19. Abhidharma is one of the three classes of Sutrayana literature: Sutra,Abhidharma and Vinaya. The first of these mainly deals with meditation, thesecond with metaphysics, and the third with philosophy of ethics. All ofBuddha's teachings in the Sutrayana classification belong to one of these threedivisions.Tibetans generally study the Abhidharma teachings based on the shastras, ortreatises of the later Indian masters, which extract the essence of the Buddha'swords as recorded in the diverse sources and present them thematically. Theirtwo favorite Abhidharma shastras are the Abhidharma kosha of Vasubandhu and theAbhidharma samucchaya of Asanga.20. Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, a collection of esoteric tantric textstranslated from the Tibetan by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup and W. Y. Evans-Wentz(London: Oxford University Press, 1935), was one of the first English languagepublications to present a complete and reliable discussion of the Six Yogas ofNaropa. The translations do contain some minor errors due to the limitations ofthe two translators and the conditions under which the work was done, but sixtyyears later still stand as excellent portraits of various aspects of Tibetantantric meditation and yoga.21. 1 discuss these in chapter seven of Death and Dying: The Tibetan Tradition(London: Penguin Arkana, 1986).22. Presumably this refers to his Great Commentary to Transference (Tib. 'Pho batik chen).23. There are many different accounts of Darma Dodey's death and thecircumstances leading up to it. The most common is that Marpa had beeninstructed to give the sixth of Naropa's Six Yogas, that of forceful projection,exclusively to Milarepa, with the injunction that it must be kept extremelysecret. Marpa instead gave it to his son Darma Dodey. This invoked theconsternation of the yogic community, who feared that it would fall into thewrong hands. One of these yogis, Rva Lotsawa, known and feared in the spiritualcommunity of eleventh-century Tibet as a self-appointed tantric policeman,visited Marpa and heavily chastised him for the transgression, informing himthat the only solution was for him to put his own son to death. Marpa was unableto do so because of his paternal affection. Rva Lotsawa therefore performed amagical ritual, transformed himself into a crow, and knocked Darma Dodey off hishorse and to his death.24. Gyalwa Wensapa (b. 1505) is one of the great legends in Gelukpa mysticalhistory and an early lineage holder of the Six Yogas transmission. He wrotequintessential guides to all the principal tantric systems preserved within theGelukpa school. These dispense with the details in the practice and go directlyto the underlying principles of the individual systems. His A Source of EveryRealization: The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa (Tib. Na ro chos druggi lagrjes dngos grub kun 'byung) is typical of his literary style.25. The most reliable account is to be found in Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa's APolitical History of Tibet (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1967). This workis invaluable to an understanding of the dark side of Tibetan history.In fact, Shakabpa probably gained his source materials from the notes of GendunChopel, the Amdo lama who had assisted George Roerich in the translation of TheBlue Annals. Gendun Chopel was the first Tibetan lama to have exposure to theWestern critical approach to historical analysis, and thus was capable ofwriting realistically on matters of conflict.This is very different from traditional Tibetan biographical or historicalwritings, which either completely gloss over conflicts and problems, or elseresort to a self-serving and self-righteous posture. Gendun Chopel, on the otherhand, seems to have freely criticized anyone and everyone wherever he felt itappropriate.Shakabpa was one of the officers who arrested Gendun Chopel for treason in 1950,after which Gendun Chopel's thousands of notes, gleaned from the Potala's vastarchives, disappeared, never to be seen again. It seems too great a coincidencethat Shakabpa later came out with a book having the quality and style of APolitical History of Tibet. This was the opinion of young Tibetan intellectualsduring my period of studies in India in the 1970s.26. His Holiness the Dalai Lama once commented that if we were to examine thelife of Tsongkhapa and calculate the amount of time he devoted to meditation, itwould seem that he gave his entire life to contemplative practice. Similarly, ifwe were to look at the volume and depth of his writings, it would seem that hewas always engaged in literary pursuits. And if we were to list the number ofteachings he gave during his lifetime, it would seem that he was alwaysteaching. \"His most amazing quality,\" stated His Holiness, \"was that heaccomplished as much as ten ordinary people in all three spheres.\"27. The practice of chulen (Tib. bcud len), or \"taking the essence,\" is treatedin The Tantric Yogas of Sister Niguma (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1984) inthe Second Dalai Lama's text on making \"essence pills\" from flowers and thenabstaining from any food and eating only a few of these pellets each day. Whileliving in India I knew several yogis who thus cut off intake of ordinary foodfor two or three years at a time, eating only a pellet or two a day forsustenance. They lost weight for the first three or four months, but after thateven became quite fat.The three main forms of the practice are: pellets made from flower petals;pellets made from certain minerals; and \"stone essence,\" in which a stone is putinto a glass of water several times a day, mantras recited, and the water thendrunk. The First Dalai Lama's writings mention a fourth technique: breathing inthe essence of starlight at night. Starlight is considered to be the essence ofenergy, and thus the most quintessential form of nutrient.A BOOK OF THREE INSPIRATIONS BY TSONGKHAPA THE GREAT1. Buddha Vajradhara is the tantric emanation of Shakyamuni, the historicalbuddha. He symbolizes the esoteric dimension of spiritual inspiration from whichthe highest yoga tantras were taught. He is the Adibuddha, or \"PrimordialBuddha,\" in all the New Schools of Tibetan Buddhism.2. Chang utterly misconstrues this passage in his translation, mistaking theterm dung rab zinpa (Tib. gdung robs 'dzin pa), or \"bone lineage holder,\" i.e.,paternal blood line, for that of la gyu zinpa (Tib. bla brgyud 'dzin pa), or\"guru lineage holder.\" The idea is that Miwang Drakpa Gyaltsen, the hereditaryPakmo Drupa ruler who requested Tsongkhapa the Great to clarify the tradition ofNaro's Six Yogas by writing a commentary to it, was a great patron of yogisengaged in the intense practice of the Six Yogas. When Tsongkhapa says that thispatron had achieved rebirth as \"one holding the ancestral lineage /Of a being onthe exalted platform of serving as chieftain / To fortunate trainees who appliedthemselves to this path...,\" Chang instead has him saying, \"Following its path,the hard-working and gifted disciples / Are led to the plane of saviors.\"Tsongkhapa's meaning is not that these disciples are led to the path of saviors,but that Miwang Drakpa Gyaltsen was a great chieftain as well as being a greatpatron of practitioners.Tibetans use the expression \"bone lineage\" for the paternal line, because theiridea is that our skeletal structure evolves from our father's sperm, and ourflesh and blood from our mother's ovum. This led to a unique sexual liberty forwomen; a Tibetan woman married to several brothers might take lovers fromamongst her husband's immediate relatives, because the \"bone lineage\" of anyoffspring would remain the same. I have encountered several cases of this natureduring my twenty years with Tibetans.3. Here Tsongkhapa's shorter manual does not mention the general Mahayanapreliminaries at all, and jumps directly into the \"Vajrayana preliminaries thatare exclusive to the Six Yogas tradition,\" i.e., the Vajrasattva and guru yogameditations. Thus the discussion of the tantric initiations and Vajrayana samayaare also omitted. This is noteworthy in that, as we will see in the followingsection of his treatise, he speaks at such length on the importance of thesepreliminary trainings and conditions.4. Tsongkhapa's wording, \"Lama Ngokpa, who quotes The Hevajra Tantra in TwoSections as saying...,\" suggests that he is unsure of the passage yetnonetheless mentions it in order to show that Lama Ngokpa advocated using thegeneral Mahayana teachings as a preliminary to the Six Yogas training.Tsongkhapa gives only the first and last line of the verse, for he had obviouslylifted it from Ngokpa's writings, where it appears in this form. I read throughThe Hevajra Tantra in Two Sections to find the passage and fill it out, but itis not to be found there. This would suggest either that Lama Ngokpa used adifferent edition of the text than the one eventually included in the Tibetancanon, or that he confused the source. I would guess the former situation to bethe case, as every chapter of this tantra has a verse beginning with the line\"firstly impart the precept....\" Presumably Lama Tsongkhapa was aware that thepassage was not to be found in the original tantra as presented in the Kangyur,and consequently he introduced it with words that link it to Ngokpa's writings,rather than directly to The Hevajra Tantra in Two Sections itself.When the Tibetan canons were compiled and edited, standard forms of thetranslations of various Indian treatises were preserved. However, a negativeside effect is that alternate translations, often made from different Indianeditions, fell out of use and over the centuries were lost. It is possible thatthis occurred with the version of the Hevajra Tantra quoted by Lama Ngokpa.5. Chang mistranslates this as \"...the misfortune bringer always turns out to beone's best friend. The fallers in the abyss are the men who follow the cattle.\"Tibet was a country of farmers and nomadic herdsmen. The image of one ox yokedto another in a plowing harness would have had a visceral impact on Tsongkhapa'sreaders. Throughout his translation Chang completely misses the raw earthinessand sheer drama of Tsongkhapa's style, which is characterized by a richness anda direct simplicity that caused him to become the single most popular writer inCentral Asian history.6. In other words, during Milarepa's time the expression Bardo Drangdrol, or\"Achieving Liberation in the Bardo,\" was another name for the Naro Choe Druk, or\"Naro's Six Dharmas.\" This probably derives from the threefold use of the termbardo in the Six Yogas system: the bardo between birth and death (i.e.,waking-state life); the bardo of sleep and dreams; and the bardo that followsthe moment of death.7. \"The Four Dharmas of Gampopa\" refers both to a short text by Gampopa, and toa meditative tradition that the text inspired.Ngulchu Dharmabhadra (b. 1722) explains in his Ornament for A Book of ThreeInspirations (Tib. Na ro chos drug gi zin Eris yid ches dgongs rgyan), \"The fourfactors included in the tradition known as 'the Four Dharmas of Gampopa' are asfollows: turning the mind to Dharma; turning Dharma into the path; using thepath to eliminate confusion; and causing confusion to arise as primordial wisdomawareness.\"8. Tsongkhapa wrote three separate treatises on the topic of the Lam Rim:extensive, intermediate and brief. The latter text, which is in verse, is alsoknown as the Lam Rim Nyamgur (Tib. Lam rim nyams mgur), or Song of the Lam RimExperience. This was used as the basis of the Third Dalai Lama's Stages on thePath to Enlightenment: Essence of Refined Gold (Tib. Lam rim gsergyi yang zhunma), which I translated in my study of the Third Dalai Lama's life andteachings, Selected Works of the Dalai Lama III: Essence of Refined Gold(Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1982). This has recently been reprinted underthe title The Path to Enlightenment by the Dalai Lama (Ithaca: Snow LionPublications, 1995). I would recommend it to any reader of the present text onNaropa's Six Yogas who would like to better understand the nature of thepreliminaries to tantric practice. The Dalai Lama's contemporary elucidation ofthe Third Dalai Lama's classical treatise brings together the best of the modernand ancient Tibetan worlds.9. Atisha Dipamkara Shrijnana, the Indian master who came to Tibet in 1042, isregarded not only as the forefather of the Kadampa school, but as an importantinfluence on all the New Schools-Kargyu, Sakya and Geluk. Gampopa's Lam Rim TarGyan (Tib. Lam rim thar rgyan), or Jewel Ornament of Liberation (translated byHerbert Guenther; London, 1959), is popularly known to Tibetans as \"The Union ofTwo Streams,\" the two being Milarepa's lineages and those of Atisha.Tsongkhapa's reference here to Atisha is relevant to his purposes for tworeasons. Firstly, the Lam Rim legacy mentioned earlier in A Book of ThreeInspirations has its root in Atisha's A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment (Skt.Bodhipathapradipa), a contemplative tradition that was wholeheartedlyincorporated by Tsongkhapa. In fact, his three Lam Rim treatises are largelyinspired by it. Secondly, this same Lam Rim tradition from Atisha wasincorporated by Gampopa and fused with the lineages he received from Milarepa,including that of the Six Yogas of Naropa. Thus Atisha's lineage became animportant basis for both the Geluk and Kargyu schools.10. The wording of Tsongkhapa's text here is intended to link thesepreliminaries to the teaching popular in the Kargyu schools under the name lodoknamzhi (Tib. blo ldok rnam bzhi), or \"Four Ways of Turning the Mind,\" whichrefers to the general Mahayana meditations that are cultivated in order toprepare the mind for tantric practice. Tsongkhapa uses this Kargyu terminologybecause the Six Yogas of Naropa, the subject of his commentary, is a Kargyulineage.11. Fifty Verses on the Guru: This is a short text in fifty verses, penned bythe Indian master and poet Ashvaghosha, that is held in great regard byTibetans. It serves as the basic guideline to how the disciple should view andbehave around the tantric guru. An English translation of it, rendered by SharpaTulku and Alex Berzin, is available from the Library of Tibetan Works andArchives, Dharamsala, India.The Thirteenth Dalai Lama comments on the importance and nature of this brieftext in \"A Guide to the Buddhist Tantras,\" which is translated in my Path of theBodhisattva Warrior (Ithaca: Snow Lion Publications, 1988):In the Resultant Vajrayana, even more so than in the Causal Sutrayana, it issaid to be extremely important to train under the guidance of a qualifiedtantric master, to avoid wrong attitudes toward him and to cultivate positiveattitudes, and to remain within the framework of the vows and commitments of thetantric path. In order to be able to do this it is useful to know the beneficialeffects of conducive attitudes and the shortcomings of faulty attitudes, how toregard the guru's entourage and possessions, the nature of correct and incorrectpractice, and so forth. All these topics are discussed in detail in The RootTantra of Guhyasamaja (Skt. Guhyasamaja mula tantra), the Hevajra Tantra in TwoSections (Skt. Hevajra tntra nama), ...and other texts. The general themes onhow to rely correctly upon the vajra guru were gleaned from these early sourceworks and collected into fifty quintessential verses, entitled Fifty Verses onthe Guru (Skt. Guru panchashika karika) by Acharya Vira, who was also known bythe names Aryashura and Ashvaghosha.12. This probably refers to his three Lam Rim treatises, mentioned in note 8above.13. Chang mistranslates this passage as, \"When Milarepa first saw Gambopa [sic],he asked Gambopa whether he had obtained the complete initiations beforeimparting the teachings of the Six Yogas. Gambopa replied, 'Like a copperutensil ready for filling with butter, I am quite ready.' Thereupon, Milarepabestowed upon him the teachings and Pith Instructions.\"Here Chang seems to have totally misread the name of one of Gampopa's earlyinitiation gurus, Maryul Loden (Tib. Mar yul blo ldan), and also this master'sguru, Zangkar Lotsawa (Tib. Zangs dkar). Mar means \"red,\" and yul means \"land\";the two together refer to a district in Western Tibet. Loden (Tib. blo idan) isa common Buddhist name meaning wise or wisdom. Thus his name was Red Land Sage.Zangkar is the name of a province of Ladakh, and also of a famous earlyeleventh-century translator from that region. Here it refers to the lama. Changseems to have taken Mar to mean \"butter,\" and the first syllable of Zangkar tomean \"copper.\" This forced him into his erroneous reading.He also gets the next line backwards: \"On another occasion, before Milarepa gaveGampopa an oral transmission teaching, he sent him to receive empowerments fromBari Lotsawa.\" Chang has this as, \"Milarepa also urged Gambopa to encourage theBari Translator to come for initiations.\" It is not the Buddhist tradition forgurus to beg others to come to their teachings or initiations.14. These are the first two of the six phases of the \"vase\" empowerment. Thevase empowerment in turn is the first of the four empowerments given toaspirants wishing to enter into highest yoga tantra practice. It is called \"vaseempowerment\" because each of its phases concludes with the sprinkling of sacredwaters from the initiation vase. The first five of these six steps introducesthe disciple to the five Tathagata families, transforming the five distortedemotions into the five wisdoms and the five psychophysical aggregates into thefive Tathagatas, thus authorizing the trainee to take up the generation stageyogas and also planting the seeds of the Nirmanakaya. The sixth vase empowermentis that of the vajra master, authorizing the trainee to later give empowermentto others after the completion of his or her training.The concluding three empowerments are called secret, wisdom awareness and sacredword.15. The blessing initiation, or jenang (Tib. rje pang; lit., subsequenttransmission) is a simpler form of empowerment and should only be given to thosewho have previously received a complete empowerment into the class of mandalabeing imparted. The \"blessing initiation\" does not have the standard stages ofinitiation, such as vase and so forth, but only has a blessing or communion of\"body, speech and mind\" of the mandala deity.These days the understanding of the distinction seems to be hazy, and lamasquite randomly give a public jenang without ensuring that participants havepreviously received the qualifying empowerments. To do so is said to degeneratethe tantric tradition, and to be harmful to both the initiating master and therecipient.His Holiness the Dalai Lama once pointed this out in an audience I had with him,and then laughed, adding, \"I suspect that even highly educated lamas do this ontheir Western tours, with thoughts of getting a larger offering from the largercrowds.\"16. Here Ngulchu Dharmabhadra states in his Ornament for A Book of ThreeInspirations (Tib. Na ro chos drug gi zin bris yid ches dgongs rgyan),The meaning of 'the four complete initiations' [in Tsongkhapa's text] is thatone should receive the four complete initiations into the appropriate highestyoga tantra system, such as any of the three Heruka Chakrasamvara lineages-thoseof Luipada, Krishnacharya or Ghantapada-or any of the four types of Hevajra-theOral Transmission Lineage, the Dombipa Lineage, the Padma Lineage, or theKrishnacharya Lineage.17. Jey Sherab Gyatso (b. 1803) states in Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations(Tib. Yid ches gsum Idan gyi shad lung zin bris),The discussion of the manner of maintaining the samaya and guidelines arediscussed in detail in the four texts famed as 'The Four Great Treatises on thePreliminary Practices' (Tib. sNgon 'gro khrid chen bzhi), which are popular inother schools such as the Sakya, Nyingma, and so forth. Although there isnothing directly from the hand of Tsongkhapa the Great that deals with thepreliminaries in that manner, i.e., with both the general Sutrayana andexclusive Vajrayana preliminaries in one text, he has written extensively on theSutrayana trainings [in his Lam Rim treatises], and referred to the Vajrayanapreliminaries in various of his tantric works....18. Here Jey Sherab Gyatso mentions in his Notes on A Book of Three Inspirationsthat the Vajrasattva meditation exhibits a predominance of the color white. Thisis because each of the four types of tantric activity-pacification,amplification, empowerment and destruction-is associated with its own color:white, yellow, red and dark blue, respectively, and in the Vajrasattva practicethe emphasis is on the first of these, or pacification. The object of thispacification is negative karma and obscuration; these are purified by means ofthe meditation and mantra recitation. Hence Vajrasattva is white in color, asare the five buddhas who come into the space above the meditator and pour forthpurifying nectars. The nectars that they pour are also white in color.Similarly, if a more complex Vajrasattva mandala with four consorts is used, allof these are white.Jey Sherab Gyatso also comments that with the guru yoga meditation it isimportant that one imagine one's body, speech and mind to be inseparable innature from the body, speech and mind of the guru (who is visualized as BuddhaVajradhara), and that this point of communion of the three be seen as arising inthe nature of the three kayas of the yidam, or mandala deity. Similarly, one'sown suchness nature is seen as being inseparable from the suchness nature of theguru, and this arises as the yidam. Sherab Gyatso comments, \"This dynamic bringsabout rapid attainment of siddhi.\"19. The first three of Marpa Lotsawa's four chief disciples-Mey (Tib. Mes), Tsur(Tib. 'Tshur), Ngok (Tib. rNgogs) and Milarepa (Tib. Mi la ras pa) are referredto in various ways throughout Tsongkhapa's manual. Mey occasionally becomes LamaMey, and also Meyton. Tsur is alternately Lama Tsur and Tsurton. Ngok appears asLama Ngok, Lama Ngokpa, Ngokpa and also Ngokton. Here the syllable ton (Tib.ston) that is sometimes suffixed to their names means \"teacher\" or \"spiritualmaster.\" Goe Lotsawa provides brief biographies of all four in The Blue Annals.20. In other words, the lamas of the Six Yogas tradition who teach that thegeneration stage yogas are unnecessary contradict the instructions of their ownlineage masters. Tsongkhapa quotes the verse from Milarepa to prove his point.21. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra explains the etymology of the term \"generation stageyoga\" as follows in An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations: \"It is called'generation stage yoga' because one meditates by generating the vision [of themandala and its deities) as symbolic of the process of life, death and bardo.\"He continues,All of Marpa's four chief disciples were first led through the generation stagepractice before being led through the completion stage. The reason is that thegeneration stage process ripens and prepares the mind of the trainee for therealizations that are brought to fulfillment by means of the completion stageyogas. Moreover, the deity yoga meditations practiced during the generationstage introduce the subject of ordinary birth, death and bardo, and point themind to how these three occasions are transformed into a path to enlightenment,until eventually the three are brought into the state of the resultant threekayas of full enlightenment.22. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra gives the list of these four \"families of Hevajra\" inAn Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations (see note 16 above). Ngulchu usesthe term rig (Tib. rigs), or \"family,\" rather than luk (Tib. lugs), or\"lineage,\" but his list clearly identifies them as individual transmissions.23. Here Tsongkhapa mentions three different transmissions of the Indianmahasiddha Luipa's lineage of Heruka Chakrasamvara.The first of them is the Zangkar lineage. We saw a reference to this earlier inthe discussion of what empowerments are appropriate as the basis of practicingthe Six Yogas of Naropa. Gampopa received this from Maryul Loden, a disciple ofZangkar the Translator. As I pointed out in note 13 above, Chang mistakes thename of Maryul Loden, translating it as \"butter,\" and takes the name of MaryulLoden's lama, i.e., Lama Zangkar, to mean \"copper vessel.\" When Tsongkhapa says,\"Gampopa relied upon the lineage of Maryul Loden, the disciple of Zangkar(Lotsawa)... known as 'the Chakrasamvara lineage of Zangkar...,\"' Chang has himsaying, \"From Gamboba, through the transmission of Ladak and Mar, the Bde mchogteaching of Ladak was transmitted.\"He also mistakes the second lineage, in which Tsongkhapa says, \"Also, theglorious Pakmo Drupa relied upon the Chakrasamvara transmission from Lochung,known as the Mar Lineage.\" Chang has him saying, \"In his youth the GloriousPag-mo-grub-pa practiced the Bde-mchog from Mar-do.\" Here Lochung does not mean\"...in his youth\"; rather, it is the popular name of a famous translator fromWestern Tibet known as Lochung, or \"The Junior Translator.\"In the third passage Tsongkhapa says, \"Moreover, the Dharma master ChojeyDrikungpa relied upon the Chakrasamvara tradition of Lama Chokro, which is thelineage from Mardo (Tib. Mar do).\" Chang omits this important lineagealtogether, and shuffles it into what was being said earlier about Pakmo Drupa'slineage.Concerning the second of the three lineages mentioned above, Lochung was one ofthe two especially great translators who appeared in Western Tibet during theeleventh century. These two are popularly known to Tibetan history as Lochen andLochung, or \"Senior Translator\" and \"Junior Translator.\" These could also berendered as \"the Elder\" and \"the Younger,\" or as \"the Greater\" and \"the Lesser.\"All that is meant is that one predates the other.The former is none other than the illustrious Lochen Rinchen Zangpo, whoinspired the renaissance of the eleventh century, and was said to be eightyyears of age when Atisha arrived in Tibet in 1042. He became a disciple ofAtisha, and after meeting him went into solitary retreat for the duration of hislife. His endorsement of Atisha undoubtedly contributed greatly to the respectthat Atisha was thereafter shown in Tibet, for at the time Lochen Rinchen Zangpowas considered the greatest spiritual master in the country. His tulku, orofficial reincarnation, lives in India today.Lochung, or \"Junior Translator,\" was a disciple of Lochen Rinchen Zangpo, andalso became a disciple of Atisha. According to The Blue Annals, this is noneother than Ngok Lekpai Sherab. I tell something of his life in Verses of a MadDalai Lama (Wheaton, IL: Quest Books, 1994).24. Chang again here totally misreads the passage and confuses the variousChakrasamvara mandalas that Tsongkhapa is recommending. This passage isdiscussed above in the introduction.Jey Sherab Gyatso comments in his Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations, \"MarpaLotsawa himself used both the Hevajra and Heruka Chakrasamvara mandalas.\" Whathe means is that Marpa would teach either as the basis of the Six Yogas.25. The coarse and subtle generation stage yogas: The former refers tovisualizing the supporting and supported mandalas; the latter refers to doingthis while simultaneously envisioning the entire mandala as being inside a dropthe size of a sesame seed. The difference is in the degree of meditativeconcentration that has been attained.26. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra's An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations states,If one appreciates the nature of the basis [i.e., the deeper nature of the bodyand mind], one will come to know the nature of the path. And throughunderstanding the nature of the path one engages in spiritual practice and comesto actualize the nature of the result, which is enlightenment.27. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra comments in An Ornament for A Book of ThreeInspirations,The approach to emptiness meditation in the tradition of the Six Yogas of Naropais slightly unlike the approaches found in other highest yoga tantra systems ofcompletion stage practice. Here the emphasis is upon ascertaining the ultimatenature of being by means of the meditational process in its causal context.What he means by this is that in other completion stage systems the emphasis inthe technique is upon resting within a proxy of the primordial wisdom and theresultant enlightenment mind, whereas in the Six Yogas system the emphasis isupon meditation on emptiness as a causal means of arousing that primordialwisdom.28. When Tsongkhapa points out the necessity of integrating the vision ofemptiness into conventional daily life, Chang utterly mistakes what is beingsaid and comments in note 55, \"Here is shown Tsong Khapa's timidness on Sunyata,and his materialistic view is clearly reflected.\" The reason why the Indianschools descending from Nagarjuna and Aryadeva call themselves the Madhyamaka,or \"Middle View\"-and all Tibetan sects claim to be based on the IndianMadhyamaka schools-is that they avoid the two extremes of reification andnihilism. This is expressed in classical Madhyamaka treatises by saying that thesyndrome of reification is eliminated through appreciating how all things areempty of true existence; and the syndrome of nihilism is eliminated byappreciating how all things simultaneously function with validity on theconventional level according to the infallible laws of interdependence andcausality. As for a \"timidness\" toward emptiness, Tsongkhapa wrote half a dozentreatises on the topic, several of which are hundreds of pages in length. Even acasual glance at what he has to say will dispel any concept that he was shy ofthe subject, or that his view was materialistic.29. Tsongkhapa's presentation of the nature of the body here is rather sparse,and leaves out the discussion of the three or four physical dimensions or\"sheathes.\" The commentary by Gyalwa Wensapa, A Source of Every Realization: TheStamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa (Tib. Na ro chos drug gi lag rjes dngos grubkun 'byung) gives a wonderful presentation of this fundamental aspect of tantrictheory. See the \"Introduction to the Nature of the Body\" section of theintroduction.30. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra comments in his An Ornament for A Book of ThreeInspirations,The physical exercises and the meditations upon the body as an empty shell arenot described in any of the authentic Indian tantric scriptures. It seems thatthey are based exclusively on the oral tradition of the gurus. When they areperformed, there is less chance of problematic side effects arising in thechannels or energies through forceful meditation on the tantric yogas; and evenif some difficulties do arise, these are mitigated.At his 1991 discourse His Holiness commented that he thought perhaps these twotechniques were developed by the early Tibetan masters.31. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra's treatment of these various arrangements is discussedin the introduction, in the \"Legacy of the Six Yogas\" section.Nagtsang Tulku, a lama who attained to prominence in the late nineteenthcentury, wrote a wonderful practice manual on the Six Yogas system, entitled ASource of Great Bliss Realization: A Guide to the Profound Six Yogas of Naropa,in which he uses an approach quite different from that of Tsongkhapa. He dividesthe completion stage practices of the Six Yogas system into two: meditating onthe inner heat and thus giving rise to the four busses; and, secondly, on thebasis of that realization, the meditations on \"the (nine) blendings.\"In his treatment of the inner heat yoga he by-passes the elaborate system ofoutlines followed by Tsongkhapa and instead presents it in eight simple steps inpractice: (1) the breathing exercises for expelling dead energies/air, togetherwith the physical exercises; (2) visualizing the energy channels; (3) purifyingthe pathways of the channels; (4) visualizing the mantric syllables in thechakras; (5) kindling the fire of the inner heat; (6) causing the fire of theinner heat to blaze; (7) how the practitioner brings about blazing andmelting/falling of the mystic drops; and (8) the special applications of blazingand melting/falling.We can see that here, unlike Tsongkhapa, he presents the physical exercises andmeditations on the body as an empty shell as the first step in the inner heattraining, and not as a preliminary.32. Marpa taught the Six Yogas differently to different disciples. Milarepareceived only the \"oral instruction transmission\" (Tib. man ngag gi brgyud).Lama Ngok and Lama Tsur received the teaching complete with all the sourcetantras and tantric shastras; thus their lineages are known as \"explanatorylineages\" (Tib. bshad brgyud).33. \"Secret whispered tradition\" (Tib. snyan brgyud) refers to an oralinstruction transmission that is always transmitted orally. Marpa used the termas a synonym for his tantric teachings.34. The four exalted transmissions of Naropa: The Nalanda Translation Committeepoint out in a footnote to their translation The Life of Marpa the Translator(Boulder: Prajna, 1982, pp. xxxii-xxxiii) that there are various ways ofdescribing these four. They are most frequently seen as \"the four instructionsof Tilopa,\" for they were first given by Tilopa to Naropa, and then laterimparted by Naropa to Marpa. The tradition of the Six Yogas of Naropa derivesfrom them. The Life of Marpa the Translator provides three different versions ofthese four.Ngulchu Dharmabhadra gives them as inner heat, karmamudra, illusory body, andclear light. See also \"The Legacy of the Six Yogas\" in the introduction.35. A wonderful account of the transmissions discussed here by Tsongkhapa can befound in greater detail in Taranatha's The Seven Instruction Lineages (Tib. bKa'bobs bdun Idan), translated by David Templeman (Dharamsala: Library of TibetanWorks and Archives, 1983). The Tibetan historian Taranatha (b. 1575) providesthe names of the gurus in seven principal tantric lineages, as well as summariesof their biographies. The names of most of the Indian mahasiddhas quoted byTsongkhapa in A Book of Three Inspirations can be found in Taranatha's text.These seven lineages contribute important elements of the Six Yogas of Naropa,and thus Templeman's book is highly recommended to anyone wanting furtherhistorical background on the Naropa system.36. Tibetans generally use an abbreviation of the Sanskrit name of the centralchannel, reducing avadhuti to dhuti. They sometimes also call it tsa uma (Tib.rtsa dbu ma). For the two side channels, rasana and lalana, they use roma (Tib.rtsa ro ma) and kyangma (Tib. rtsa brkyang ma), respectively.37. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra explains the \"lotus petals\" of the energy channels asfollows in An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations:At the navel chakra an energy channel petal reaches into each of the fourdirections; these four then split into two, making eight; these split into two,making sixteen; these split into two, making thirtytwo; and finally these alsosplit into two each, making sixty-four.He goes on to explain how the eight at the heart chakra, sixteen at the throatchakra, thirty-two at the crown chakra and sixty-four at the navel chakra areformed in the same manner, beginning with four that branch out to eight, and soforth.He also points out that the channel petals at the navel flow upward, like anoverturned umbrella, and those at the heart flow downward, like an uprightumbrella. The same is the case with the \"petals\" of the chakras at the throatand crown. This is what Tsongkhapa means here when he says, \"...within anaccording embrace of method and wisdom.\"38. Lawapa (Skt. Lvavapada) also plays an important role in the transmission ofthis doctrine, and thus is mentioned several times throughout Tsongkhapa'streatise. He was the guru of Jalandaripa, who in turn was the guru ofKrishnacharya, mentioned below. His story is told by Taranatha in The SevenInstruction Lineages.39. Tsongkhapa refers to Krishnacharya several times in this section of A Bookof Three Inspirations, because this Indian master plays an important role in thetransmission of both the Hevajra and Chakrasamvara tantric cycles. These are thetwo principal tantric sources of the inner heat doctrine as received by Tilopaand transmitted to Naropa. The Tibetan historian Taranatha is an excellentsource for knowledge of his life and works. See David Templeman's translation,Taranatha's Life of Krishnacarya/Kanha (Dharamsala: Library of Tibetan Works andArchives, 1989).40. Padmini (Tib. Pad ma can) is both the name of a well-known tenth-centuryIndian female tantrika and the title of a tantric treatise in the HerukaChakrasamvara cycle.41. 1 did not have access to the collected works of Pakmo Drupa during theperiod of my writing, and thus was unable to check these two compositions, hisverse and prose writings on the Six Doctrines. Tsongkhapa refers to boththroughout this treatise.42. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra states in An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirationsthat this vase breathing technique also has great health benefits and is widelyused in the tantric yogas for self-healing. I personally have seen it taught inthis context, as illustrated by a work by the First Dalai Lama (b. 1391) on theeight generation stage and eight completion stage yogas of theAmitayus/Hayagriva tantric cycle having its origins in the Nepalese femalemystic Siddharani.43. The mantric AH-stroke at the navel is sometimes referred to as AM (or theAM-stroke) in Tsongkhapa's text, presumably because of the crescent of halfmoon, sun and nada above it, The sun symbol in the crescent is also used in theTibetan script to denote the sound of the suffix letter \"M.\" Thus the syllableAH with a crescent can also signify the sound of AM. The manner of visualizationof the two, AH and AM, would remain the same, i.e., a perpendicular stroke withits crescent.44. His Holiness the Dalai Lama laughed when explaining this traditional mannerof counting, and said that many yogis would lose the number of the count in theattempt to test themselves. Consequently the system of counting has beenreplaced by a simpler method. With the fingers of the right hand one taps theright knee, left knee and forehead, and then slowly snaps the fingers threetimes in front of the heart. The number of times one repeats this cycle iscounted, and one's competence in the practice is measured as best, intermediateor least, based on whether the cycle is 108, 72 or 36.45. There is a considerable amount of literature in English on sexual yoga aspracticed in the Hindu tantric traditions of India, and also as practiced in theTaoist traditions of China. The Buddhist tantrikas have over the centuriesemphasized secrecy with this aspect of tantric training, and have restrictedtheir knowledge of the sexual meditative techniques to initiates.46. At this point in his commentary Nagtsang Tulku's A Source of Great BlissRealization: A Guide to the Profound Six Yogas of Naropa explains the process ofarising with the illusory body in the language of the \"nine blendings,\" asdiscussed in the introduction.Perhaps the best English-language account of the principles of illusory body andclear light as taught in the Guhyasamaja Tantra, the source of these doctrinesin the Six Yogas system, is Daniel Cozort's Highest Yoga Tantra (Ithaca: SnowLion Publications, 1986). Cozort's discussion of the doctrine of final mindrefinement and its relation to the illusory body doctrine, pages 89-95, arerelevant to what Tsongkhapa is saying here.47. Here Ngulchu Dharmabhadra makes the rather interesting comment, \"The placeat which this illusory body is produced for the first time is within one's oldaggregates, at the center of the heart chakra.\" He also states, \"Themeditational technology for both the illusory body and clear light doctrines inthe Six Yogas system comes from the Guhyasamaja Tantra, and is based upon theArya Cycle of Guhyasamaja as transmitted by Marpa Lotsawa himself.\"A Book of Three Inspirations presents the Guhyasamaja ideas in a few pages;anyone wanting a more elaborate picture is referred to Daniel Cozort's HighestYoga Tantra.48. As Lama Tsongkhapa implies in this treatise, and as Jey Sherab Gyatso pointsout more explicitly in Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations, these three levelsof training in the illusory nature of experience are really intended forbeginners. Jey Sherab Gyatso states,The early Tibetan masters, such as Marpa, Milarepa and so forth, primarilytaught these methods in order to plant instincts on the mindstream ofpractitioners on initial stages in the training.... The actual illusory bodyyoga...is practiced in the house assembled at the center of the heart chakrafrom the substance of the white and red drops.49. Here Tsongkhapa is simply pointing out that one must appreciate the ultimatelevel of reality, the emptiness nature of all existents, in light of theconventional reality of how things function with validity on the ordinary level.That is to say, even though all things ultimately are void of a self nature, onthe conventional level there are living beings who hear sounds, see things,engage in activities, create karma through their actions and then experience theaccording results, and so forth.Chang writes in his footnote 82, \"This statement reflects Tsong Khapa'sphilosophy of Voidness to the effect that all conceptions are Void (Empty), butthat beings themselves exist.\"In fact Tsongkhapa is not saying this at all, and clearly regards living beingsas every bit as void of self-nature as inanimate phenomena. He follows in thefootsteps of the classical Indian Madhyamaka masters Nagarjuna, Aryadeva andChandrakirti, and thus teaches that all existents ultimately lack trueexistence, yet nonetheless on the conventional level of reality continue tofunction with validity. \"Conceptions\" and \"living beings\" are no different inthis respect. Thoughts, living beings, buddhas, worms, tables and elephants allequally abide in the one-tasteness of emptiness as their ultimate nature; yetconventionally, based on names, labels and mental imputation, they functionaccording to the laws of cause and effect. Nagarjuna dedicates Chapter 24 of hismost famous and quintessential work, Verses on the Middle View (Skt. Madhyamakakarika shastra), to this very point.50. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra's Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations presentsthe doctrine of \"the bardo of becoming,\" i.e., the bardo that is experiencedbetween death and rebirth, together with the nature of the bardo body, underthirteen topics. These are as follows: (1) etymology: it is called \"the bardo ofbecoming\" because it comes into being from the mind's inner visions; (2)physical nature: it is born from mind and the subtle energy seeds carried by themind, and appears with all senses complete; (3) form: one assumes the form ofthe world into which one will take rebirth; (4) color: when good karma is thedriving force, one's body is the color of white moonlight; when driven bynegative karma it is the color of dark clouds at night; (5) seeming age: whenorienting toward rebirth in the world of sensuality, or the kamadhatu, itappears as between five and ten years of age; (6) sense of motion: whenpropelled toward a lower rebirth there is the sensation of descending; whenpropelled toward rebirth as a ghost or animal there is a sense of wandering on aflatland; and when a high rebirth as a human, asura or deva is indicated, thesense is of moving upward; (7) abilities of cognizance: it perceives companionsof a form similar to itself, and has the five clairvoyances; (8) sustenance: itconsumes only scents and aromas; (9) behavioral patterns: it is propelled by thepositive and negative karmic instincts that it carries within itself; (10)powers and strengths: it can instantly and miraculously travel anywhere in theuniverse without obstruction, with the exception of its future place of rebirth;(11) signs: there is no sun or moon in the sky, the body casts no shadow andleaves no footprints, those to whom one calls out do not seem to hear and do notreply, and there are fearful sounds, such as of windstorms, earthquakes, etc.;(12) duration: its life span is indefinite, but lasts a maximum of seven timesseven cycles; and (13) its manner of taking rebirth: if by miraculous birth,there is an attraction to the place of rebirth; if the birth mode is byheat/metamorphosis, the attraction is to the aroma of the place; and if thebirth is to be by egg or womb, the bardo being sees the copulating parents tobe, and develops attraction for the parent of the sex opposite to that it willtake, and aversion for the parent of the same sex.51. These two fourth-century Indian scriptures, the Abhidharma kosha byVasubandhu and the Abhidharma samucchaya by his brother Asanga, are both verypopular with Tibetans. The former is the more widely studied, and is part of thecurriculum of all large Gelukpa monastic universities. Many of the Tibetanattitudes toward the nature of the afterlife derive from it.52. When the term \"bardo\" is used in this threefold way, it encompasses thetotality of sentient experience. During Milarepa's lifetime (b. 1040) the SixYogas tradition was therefore known by the name Bardo Trangdol gyi Menngak, \"TheOral Transmission for Achieving Liberation in the Bardo.\" Tsongkhapa mentionsthis in the preliminary sections of A Book of Three Inspirations, and it isdiscussed in the \"Six Yogas, Three Bardo States, and Nine Blendings\" section ofthe introduction.As Tsongkhapa explains, because the Six Yogas system speaks of three bardostates, it must also speak of three illusory bodies, i.e., one for each of thethree bardos. Thus there is the illusory body produced in meditation during thewaking state; the illusory body experienced in dreams; and the illusory bodythat is the bardo form.53. This important text by the Indian master Aryadeva is referred to severaltimes by Tsongkhapa in A Book of Three Inspirations. It is a commentary toNagarjuna's Five Stages (Skt. Pancha krama). Because Aryadeva was Nagarjuna'schief disciple and Dharma heir, this work is considered to be the mostauthoritative Indian guide to Nagarjuna's important breakdown of the Guhyasamajatantric system. As stated earlier, the illusory body and clear light doctrinesin the Six Yogas of Naropa are derived from the Guhyasamaja system, soAryadeva's commentary is especially relevant here.54. Again, Ngulchu Dharmabhadra clarifies the practice in his An Ornament for ABook of Three Inspirations:The special application of the consciousness transference practice is asfollows. As before, one meditates on the inner heat practice and the vasebreathing technique in order to draw the energies into the central channel. Thisis said to be integral to the process. One should also engage in the sixphysical exercises as taught earlier, and perform the meditation on the body asan empty shell for a few moments. The three channels are visualized as before,with emphasis on the clarity of the central channel. In the gateway of the upperaperture stands a white syllable KSHA, its head pointing downward [i.e.,standing upside down], thus blocking the channel. Again, the chakras at theheart and navel are visualized as before.The two side channels join the central channel at the site of the loweraperture, four finger-widths below the navel. One meditates as before on theAH-stroke syllable that stands on a moon disc at the navel chakra. Also, oneenvisions the heart chakra, its petals pointing downward, like an inverted halfmoon... the long HUM syllable standing on a moon disc upon it, its head pointingdownward, seat of the life-sustaining energies... one's mind, like an imagereflected in a mirror, between the U vowel and the HA portion of the HUM.55. As Ngulchu points out, the process described in the previous note causes theenergies to be drawn into the central channel, rise, and strike the AH stroke,thus igniting the mystic fire. The energies then rise to the HUM at the heartchakra and strike the life-supporting energies there, causing the HUM to reverseits position and stand upright. The life energies, together with the syllableHUM, then rise to the KSHA at the crown. This then descends to the heart, whereagain the HUM takes its place, standing with head downward. This process isrepeated again and again, and is practiced in four daily sessions.56. Ngulchu's An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations gives these eight asfollows: mouth, navel, sexual organ, anus, \"treasury,\" nose, eyes and ears. Headds that the \"Great Commentary\" to the Six Yogas system written by YongdzinPandita, a text said to be the most extensive Gelukpa treatise on the Six Yogasof Naropa, states that the practitioner on more initial levels can simplyconcentrate on the central channel to effect the transference, without blockingthese eight with mantric syllables. The term \"treasury\" above probably refers tothe forehead aperture.All eight of these apertures are to be \"blocked by mantric syllables,\" asTsongkhapa describes in the passages that follow.57. Concerning the tantric assistant, Ngulchu's Ornament for A Book of ThreeInspirations just adds, \"He or she should be well embellished with the tantricsamaya, and skilled in tantric activities.\"58. Daniel Cozort translates these as \"elaborative,\" \"non-elaborative,\" and\"very non-elaborative.\" See Daniel Cozort, Highest Yoga Tantra (Snow LionPublications, 1986), pp. 91-93. However, Tsongkhapa gives the three a slightlydifferent definition than does the nineteenth-century lama Ngawang Palden, theauthor of the Tibetan text upon which Cozort's book is based.Ngulchu Dharmabhadra states in An Ornament for A Book of Three Inspirations,In general, activities are of three levels. For those with inclinations for thelesser way there are the activities that avoid desire and sexuality. For thosewith inclinations for the vast ways there are the activities of creative deedsand the paramitas. Finally, for those with inclinations toward the profound paththere are the activities that utilize desire and sexual energy.In other words, \"activities\" can be considered within the context of any of thethree yanas-Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana.Ngulchu continues,As for the third of these, they are of three types, known as \"withembellishment,\" \"without embellishment,\" and \"utterly without embellishment.\"These three apply to both the generation and completion stage levels ofpractice.59. Ngulchu Dharmabhadra again clarifies Tsongkhapa's meaning in An Ornament forA Book of Three Inspirations:The special activities are used by those proficient in the coarse and subtlegeneration stage in order to bypass the need to engage in the tantric ritualactivities such as pacification, increase, power and wrath, and instead godirectly to the eight magical powers. For someone who has already attainedmeditative stabilization, these eight are accomplished in as quick a time asseven days when they rely upon these special activities.As for the activities termed \"with embellishment\" and \"without embellishment,\"in both cases they refer to engaging in the practice from within the sphere ofawareness of the suchness nature of being. In general, one indulges in thesensual activities as the path, and in particular indulges in sex yoga with akarmamudra. In the former case [i.e., activities with embellishment] the yogiand yogini engage in the activity together with such embellishments as wearingerotic clothing, singing, dancing, and so forth. In the later case the yogi andyogini engage in the activities with minimal embellishment.Finally, \"activities utterly without embellishment\" refers to not engaging inpractice with an actual sexual partner, or karmamudra, but instead doing so witha jnanamudra, or visualized dakini.60. Jey Sherab Gyatso states in Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations (Tib. Yidches gsum Idan gyi shad lung zin bris),There is also a \"Treasure Text\" source of the Six Yogas, but Tsongkhapa writesthat he has no confidence in it whatsoever. This is the only occasion in LamaTsongkhapa's writings in which he directly criticizes the Treasure Texttradition; at least, I am not aware of him doing so elsewhere.The Tibetan text says ter ney ton (Tib. gter nas bton), or \"revealed astreasures.\" This refers to a genre of literature in the Nyingma (Old Schools ofTibetan Buddhism) and Bonpo (pre-Buddhist) that emerged after the civil wars ofthe seventh and eighth centuries, in which most of Tibet's libraries weredestroyed. Historically the first texts of this nature were bey ter (Tib. sbasgter), or \"buried treasures,\" because in an attempt to save their literatureboth sides hid their books from wandering armies by burying them or hiding themin caves. Many of the people who had done so died before the texts were takenout, and as a result these were only discovered in future decades or centuries,if at all. Nyingma writers stated (and all later Buddhist historians havereiterated) that the Bonpos had no literature; but this is strongly contested byWestern scholars such as David Snellgrove and contemporary Tibetan scholars suchas Namkhai Norbu.In later centuries there arose the popular belief in \"buried treasures\" thatpurportedly had been composed and hidden by Guru Padmasambhava, the Indiantantric master who had visited Tibet in the mid-eighth century. According topopular belief, Padmasambhava had written and concealed hundreds of thesescriptures, with the thought that they would be revealed in and by futuregenerations when the appropriate time had come.Later on the traditions of \"dream treasures\" (Tib. mi lam gter ma), \"meditationtreasures\" (Tib. dgongs gter), and \"visionary revelations\" (Tib. dag snang)emerged. Some of Tibet's greatest literature can be found in these three genres.Unlike buried treasures, which are rather simplistic in style, these three laterforms of Nyingmapa and Bonpo literature are born from wonderful spiritualinspiration.61. Concerning these two personages who had requested Tsongkhapa the Great tocompose his treatise, Jey Sherab Gyatso's Notes on A Book of Three Inspirations(Tib. Yid ches gsum Idan gyi shad lung zin bris) states,Tsongkhapa's text was composed at the request of two brothers from the PakmoDrupa family: Miwang Drakpa Gyaltsen, who was the principal sponsor of the GreatPrayer Festival [which Tsongkhapa founded in 1409], and his younger brotherChojey Sonam Gyaltsen.The elder brother, in accordance with Tibetan medieval tradition, had inheritedthe throne of political administration. Therefore Tsongkhapa says of him,\"Miwang Drakpa became famed throughout this domain / As a chieftain dedicated tothe Six Yogas tradition.\"The first part of the name of the younger brother, Chojey Sonam Gyaltsen,suggests that he was a monk. \"Chojey\" literally means \"Dharma master.\" Here itis probably being used as an honorific for a monk of aristocratic background.Tsongkhapa's reference to him in the concluding verses of A Book of ThreeInspirations describes him as one \"whose wisdom pulsates / With having read thesacred scriptures in depth, and who / Has become rich in profound spiritualrealization.\" This reinforces the probability that he was a monk."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYPART I: TIBETAN TEXTS CITED IN THE INTRODUCTIONA Book of Three Inspirations: A Treatise on the Stages of Training in theProfound Path of Naro's Six DharmasZab lam na ro'i chos drug gi sgo nas 'khrid pa'i rim pa yid ches gsum Idan zhesbya baby Tsongkhapa the Great (1357-1419)A Brief Manual on the Manner of Taking Up the Practice of the Stages inMeditation of \"Naro's Six Dharmas,\" Compiled from the Teachings of Jey Rinpocheyby Sempa Chenpo KunzangpaNa ro chos drug gi dmigs rim lag to len tshul bsdus pa rje'i gsungs bzhin semsdpa' chen po kun bzang pas bkod paby Tsongkhapa the Great (1357-1419)Notes on A Book of Three InspirationsYid ches gsum Idan gyi bshad lung zin brisby Jey Sherab Gyatso (1803-1875)An Ornament for A Book of Three InspirationsNa ro chos drug gi zin bris yid ches dgongs rgyanby Ngulchu Dharmabhadra (1722-1851)Prayer to the Lineage Masters of the Six Yogas of NaropaNa ro chos druggi bla brgyud kyi smon lamby the Seventh Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Kalzang Gyatso (1708-1757)A Song in Praise of Tsongkhapa the GreatrJe Tsong kha pa chen po'i stod paby the Eighth Karmapa, Gyalwa Mikyo Dorjey (1507-1554)A Source of Every Realization: The Stamp of the Six Yogas of Naropa Na ro chosdrug gi lag rjes dngos grub kun 'byungby Gyalwa Wensapa Lobzang Dondrup (1505-1566)A Source of Great Ecstasy Realization: A Guide to the Profound Six Yogas ofNaropa Zab lam na ro'i chos drug gi khrid yig bde chen dngos grub 'byung gnasby Nagtsang Tulku (fl. mid-nineteenth c.)PART II: TEXTS QUOTED BY LAMA TSONGKHAPAINDIAN TEXTSTitles appear first in English, followed by the abbreviated title used byTsongkhapa in A Book of Three Inspirations.
