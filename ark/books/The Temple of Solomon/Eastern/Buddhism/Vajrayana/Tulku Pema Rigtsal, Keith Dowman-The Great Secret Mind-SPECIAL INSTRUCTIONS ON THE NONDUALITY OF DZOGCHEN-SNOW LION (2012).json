Weaving in personal stories and everyday examples, Pema Rigtsalleads the reader to see that all phenomena are the spontaneous display of mind, amagical illusion, and yet there is something shining in the midst of experience that isnaturally pure and spacious. Not recognizing this natural great perfection is the rootcause of suffering and self-centered clinging. After introducing us to this liberatingview, Pema Rigtsal explains how it is stabilized and sustained in effortlessmeditation: without modifying anything, whatever thoughts of happiness or sorrowarise simply dissolve by themselves into the spaciousness of pure presence.The book is divided into chapters on the view, meditation as the path, conduct, theattainment, and the four bardos. Each chapter consists of mini-sections that can be readas stand-alone Dharma talks. Pema Rigtsal has studied and lived with severalauthentic Dzogchen masters and has surprising stories to tell about theirunconventional methods to introduce students to the subtle view of Dzogchen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TULKU PEMA RIGTSAL is one of the last Tibetan tulkus to receive the benefit of afull traditional training with no disruption from political conflict, and one of the last tohead a traditional monastery.

That is thegreat secret of the mind.Each person is composed of body and mind. The body is precious, but like a hotel, it is atemporary abode of the mind—a collection of gross elements destined to dissolve into theearth.Mind is a stream of consciousness produced and functioning by grasping at mentalobjects as if they had a truly existing “self” or entity (bdag ’dzin) with the passion ofemotions—creating positive and negative deeds (karma) and causing joyful and painfulreactions. Mind, not the body, is the identity of who we are as an ordinary person.According to esoteric Buddhist teaching, such as Dzogpa Chenpo (rdzogs pa chen po;mahasandhi) or Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, mind has two aspects: the conceptual orrelative mind (sems) and intrinsic awareness, the true nature of mind (sems nyid), which isbuddhahood. Intrinsic awareness is the ever-present unity of the ultimate sphere (dbyings)and primordial wisdom (ye shes) as one taste.Through training in meditation, we purify the two obscurations—emotional afflictions(nyon sgrib) and intellectual duality (shes sgrib)—of the mind, and we perfect the twofoldaccumulation (tshogs)—meritorious deeds (bsod nams) and realization of wisdom (yeshes).As the result of such meditations, we realize the intrinsic awareness of the mind, theessence of which is openness (or emptiness—stong pa nyid) and the nature of which isclarity (gsal ba) and compassionate power that is ceaseless and all-pervasive. Then,naturally, we attain the threefold buddha-body: the perfection of twofold purity is theultimate body (chos sku) of buddhahood. The ever-present pure forms (sku) of the fiveclasses (rigs) of buddhas and the pure-lands (zhing khams) with fivefold wisdom (ye shes)and five certainties (nges pa) are the enjoyment body (longs sku). The emanation of infiniteappearances to serve ordinary beings is the manifestation body (sprul sku).

For most of us, though, itremains secret, as we have not even a clue as to its presence because it has been fullycovered by the emotional and intellectual clouds of the mind that are rooted in dualisticgrasping.Attainment of buddhahood is not about getting somewhere else through some externalmeans. It is about awakening the innate nature of our own mind itself, as it is, andtranscending the conceptual mind. Rigzin Jigme Lingpa writes, Realization of the intrinsic awareness that transcends the mindIs the unique teaching of Dzogpa Chenpo.2 The Third Dodrupchen writes, “In Dzogpa Chenpo, you meditate solely on the intrinsicawareness of the mind, using it as the path training. It does not employ thoughts (rtog pa)since thoughts are mind (sems). Having made the distinction of intrinsic awareness frommind, you just contemplate on it.”3In this lineage, not only have many meditators realized the true intrinsic awareness,buddhahood, but they have also physically transformed their gross bodies into subtle lightbodies or fully dissolved them without leaving any remains behind at the time of death asthe sign of their merging into the union of the ultimate sphere and primordial wisdom.Dzogchen is the swiftest path and easiest goal to attain. Paradoxically, however, it isalso the hardest for many of us to realize, as we are completely trapped in the habits ofelaborate dualistic concepts and emotional afflictions, with no idea how to ease them andawaken the ultimate openness (emptiness) of our own minds. That is why Kyabje DudjomRinpoche once gave me this most simple and profound teaching, “The greatest difficulty ofDzogpa Chenpo meditation is that it is too easy for many to comprehend!”In order to make the journey on this path and realize the true intrinsic nature of the mindas it is, it is essential to be under the careful guidance of a truly awakened master. Becauseof our strong habits of dualistic perception, without guidance we would easily fall into thetraps of dualistic perception in various gross or subtle layers of the mind, without ourrecognizing them, while our meditation is in progress.The inner secrets of the mind taught in Dzogchen that have been whispered among thefully awakened masters for centuries in the sacred sanctuaries of the Himalaya have beenrevealed clearly and thoroughly in this book by the highly accomplished teacher TulkuPema Rigtsal Rinpoche. Keith Dowman, with his brilliant gift of letters, has rendered thistext into English with great care.Tulku Rinpoche, who comes from the lineage of Degyal Rinpoche of the Dudjom Lingpatradition, received this teaching from the greatest Dzogchen masters of the twentiethcentury.

At the age of three, hewas recognized by His Holiness Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche as the reincarnation of ChimmeRinpoche, the head lama of Ngari Pureng She Pheling Monastery, which is Riwo Gedenpa.Chimme Rinpoche was one of the best qualified disciples of the first Degyel Rinpoche andwas recognized as one of the successive rebirths of the great Indian saint Pha DampaSangye. Until the age of nineteen, Tulku Pema Rigtsal studied Tibetan reading, handwriting,composition, and so forth, and the sadhana practices of the Dudjom Tersar (New TreasureTeachings), under his father, Degyel Rinpoche.For more than a decade after turning nineteen, Pema Rigtsal Rinpoche, accompanied byKhenchen Dawai Wozer, received the teachings from Khenchen Choying KhyabdalRinpoche. While studying under Khechen Choying Khyabdal Rinpoche, he studied andcontemplated the Zhungchen Chusum and the teachings of Rongzompa, Longchenpa,Mipham Rinpoche, Jigme Lingpa, and Ngari Panchen.In 1985, in Phurba Chen, in Humla Yolwang, in the far northwest of Nepal, heestablished Namkha Khyung Dzong monastery, building its exterior structure and innersupports (altars, libraries, and so on) for worship. About 150 monks now reside there.Besides continuously teaching sutra and tantra, the Zhungchen Chusum in particular, with aspecial emphasis on the wisdom views of Mipham Rinpoche, he also stayed in retreat toread the Kangyur and Nyingma Gyubum. He has completed a closed three-year and a six-month retreat as well.In general, he gives teachings on the Tersar Preliminary Practices, the Kunsang LamaiZhalung, Bodhicharyavatara, and the Richo, Nangjang Neluk Rangjung, and otherDudjom Tersar teachings, to the people of Humla and those from the Ngari part of Tibet,and especially to those among them who are sincere in their practice.

Fourth, it has been written for Western Buddhistswho may be attracted to Dzogchen by its current high media profile and for Westernstudents of Dzogchen.

But hand in hand with technological development arise conflict,disease, and degeneration of the environment. Likewise, the many new types of weapons ofwar pose a great threat to both the world and its inhabitants. As a result, we all sufferintensely in a way that was unimaginable five hundred years ago. The suffering broughtabout by new illnesses and fear of modern weapons overwhelms the pleasure arising fromtechnological advance, and everyone in this world, from the rich to the poor, suffersequally in this regard. Someone who experiences complete and perfect well-being,mentally and physically, is extremely rare. Further, if we consider that, no matter how greatan abundance of possessions people have, many still kill themselves, and that every daystill more and more people threaten others under the pretext of acting on behalf of culture orreligion, it becomes clear that materialism cannot make this world a happy and pleasantplace.If we wish to enjoy a pleasant and happy life, first of all, we need the cause ofhappiness, which is loving-kindness and compassion. For example, in order for ahousehold to be happy, it is vital that there be love and affection between husband andwife. In the same way, such sentiments are needed between friends, between cultures, andbetween countries. In short, once there are two people together wishing for happiness andwell-being, loving-kindness and compassion must arise, each toward the other. Moreover,they need a pure intention, free of both expectation of reward and selfish attitudes. This isvery important. If that is lacking, our loving-kindness and compassion are biased andpartial, and when we encounter negative circumstances, we are conflicted, and again wesuffer. It is as the Tibetan proverb says, “When our compassion wears out, anger becomesthe enemy.”Genuine loving-kindness and compassion that are free of selfish intentions andexpectation of reward are like wonderful medicines that can benefit the whole of society.Until impartial loving-kindness and compassion are present, no matter how strong anaffection may dwell in a kind person’s heart right now, and no matter how strong the bondbetween different countries, such sentiments can never last. The hope that something willaccrue in return may produce disappointment that stirs up resentment, and once againconflict will arise. The root of the problem is selfishness. If we can be free of suchselfishness and take on loving-kindness and compassion, like fragrant scent on top of gold,then society as a whole may improve.In this book, The Great Secret of Mind, I have tried to explain how to abandon selfishattitudes and give rise to uncontrived loving-kindness and compassion by means of thetechnique of the Great Perfection. From the general perspective of dharma practitioners, it"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"is a way to accomplish buddhahood in their next lifetime and enjoy ultimate happiness. Notonly that, but even for those who do not accept the likelihood of future lives, it is clear that,in each of us, as in society at large, the five poisons—ignorance, attachment, aversion,pride, and jealousy—cause suffering; clear also that anger and jealousy not only causeconflict between countries and discord between couples but may even lead people to thedrastic measure of murder and suicide. It is my hope that this book will act as a means ofrelief and solace for all of these people.I have written this book mainly for those of the younger generation who have an interestin dharma. Moreover, the monastery where I live, in the Humla district in west Nepal, isnot far from Mount Kailash, and I often meet young trekkers from East and West who are ontheir way there. I have met many who, even though they have no belief in buddha-dharma,are curious about it, and when I discuss it with them and answer their questions, most ofthem seem to appreciate it. Not only that, but several times I have received messages frompeople telling me that the dharma I explained to them has been of great benefit in their lives.For these reasons, with these young people in mind, I have often thought it would bebeneficial if I were to write a book. Further, my Taiwanese students, such as Shen Yee Lingand others, told me repeatedly that it would be very helpful if I would gather all the dharmateaching I had given until now and put it into a book.To mention only the key people who helped during the composition of this book and itstranslation into English, first of all, I would like to thank both Tulku Kundrol Nyima and themonk Yonten for tidying up the text the first time round. I would also like to thank the monkKyabne, who helped me search for reference texts and so forth while I was writing it, andTsultrim, who later typed the Tibetan text into the computer and proofread it several times.I would like to thank my translator and editor, Keith Dowman, who gave so much timeand effort to translating the text into English, preparing the English edition, and writing acritical introduction; Tenzin Dorje, who assisted him and freely gave so much of his time;Sonam Lhundrub, who helped explain many crucial points during the translation process;my student Nyima Gyeltsen, who helped clarify different points to the translator while Iwas in a one-year retreat; Michael Friedman for the final editing of the English translation;and my younger brother Sangye Gyatso, who has overseen the entire project and alsoassisted with interpreting into English. To all of those who have helped, I would like tothank you from the depths of my heart."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introduction IT SHOULD BE STRESSED at the outset that the author of The Great Secret of Mind, TulkuPema Rigtsal Dorje, is a fully ordained Buddhist monk. Not only is he a bhikshu, he is alsothe abbot of a large, functioning monastery integrated into the social fabric of theHimalayan society that it serves. He has in his charge 150 young and not-so-young monkswho look to him for guidance on the Dzogchen path within the frame of the Nyingmaschool’s religious training. He is also the guiding light of a group of tantric yogins andngakpas who received Dzogchen instruction from his father, a highly respected tantricyogin from a Khampa family that had settled in the Mount Kailash area and built amonastery there (Namkha Khyung Dzong) in the early part of the twentieth century. Further,Pema Rigtsal is steeped in the Tersar tradition of Dudjom Rinpoche Jigtral Yeshe Dorje,another of his root gurus, who was very much concerned with the integration of themonastic and the tantric ethos, and thus emphasized the teaching of the three disciplines—monastic, bodhisattvic, and tantric—as unified and noncontradictory. But it is as a Buddhistmonk whose discipline is derived from the Buddha’s vinaya and abhidharma that PemaRigtsal teaches Dzogchen.Tulku Pema Rigtsal’s background is important for a number of reasons. First, he is one ofthe last Tibetan tulkus to receive the benefit of a full traditional training without theinterference of Chinese Communist authorities or the distraction of popular Westernculture. He is one of only a handful of tulkus who run monasteries in the traditional manner,while ministering to the local community that created them. The Western Nepali-Tibetanborderlands in Humla provide that opportunity. Pema Rigtsal received a comprehensiveacademic training from several highly regarded khenpo scholars in Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan,India, and also Tibet. This not only gave him grounding in the tradition of the Mahayanasutras but also, in India, opened up a window on the modern, western world. Tocounterbalance that sutric education and to plunge himself deeply into the strictly Tibetancultural aspect of Vajrayana, he spent seven years in Tibet, five of them at the DzogchenGompa in Kham. In that way, he is a tulku who combines the qualities of a Buddhistpandita-academic, comfortable in monasteries, with those of a yogin-meditator who knowsthe rigors of retreat in a snowline hermitage. He has utilized the fruit of this education toteach buddha-dharma, in general, and Dzogchen, in particular, in Southeast and East Asia.He has thereby confronted the quandaries of Vajrayana praxis in the modern world and hasarrived at various important conclusions regarding them. Finally, he is a Buddhist monkpracticing Dzogchen, and that identity has brought the paradoxical complexities of sutra visà vis Dzogchen into clear focus.This book may appear at first sight, therefore, to be a textbook of graduated, progressiveDzogchen. With its accent on sutric Mahayana Buddhism, it may seem to be written for"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"monks of the Nyingma school. But if we were to sieve out the pure Dzogchen precepts thatare contained herein, we would hold in our hands the keys of radical Dzogchen, the pureDzogchen of the old tantras. The structure of the text whereby the secret Dzogcheninstruction forms a patchwork together with moralistic homilies and instruction onmeditation technique imitates the manner in which recognition of the nature of mind mayarise within the framework of the practices of Vajrayana Buddhism. Essentially, then, themessage is, “Catch the ultimate meaning if you can, but otherwise settle down to a life ofimmersion in the tantric cultural traditions of old Tibet until your time is right, or until thesynchronicitous moment adventitiously occurs.” As Rongzompa says in Applying theMahayana Method, For those who are unable to remain in the natural state that is the great perfection, weteach the graduated, progressive mode of striving. And as Pema Rigtsal himself maintains: We will be released by the realization that everything is the intrinsic creativity of purepresence. When we fail in this understanding, holding object and subject as two, wewander in samsara where we need to depend upon antidotes and gradual progress on apath of cultivating the good and rejecting the bad. Until we recognize creativity itself as the magical illusion of pure presence, until wehave gained confidence, optimized our creativity, and attained release, we must trainon a gradual path. So long as we are plagued by dualistic concepts, like the viewer of a painting whosees in three dimensions what the artist had painted in two, we must distinguishbetween view and meditation. For this reason, the yogins and yoginis should strive intheir meditation in a secluded place.4 Another way of saying it is that until the factors of enlightenment arise synchronisticallyand adventitiously in the mind, there is nothing better to do than sit and meditate. The meritaccumulated may facilitate communication with one’s fellow creatures and the environmentbecause contrived meditation for the most part produces greater facility on the monastic orbodhisattvic path. More specifically, the meditative techniques of shamata (calm abiding)and vipasyana (insight meditation) are most usefully practiced in the absence of realizationof the view, or in the case of some kind of permanent regression from the view. When thelama is preaching the value of the graduated path, insisting upon the importance of shamataas the method of taking us up the ladder of Dzogchen through the stages of Cutting Through(trekcho) and Direct Crossing (togel), rather than providing a method of realization, he ispreaching the value of monastic Vajrayana culture. If shamata were effective in therecognition of the nature of mind, the world would be full of Dzogchen masters. Pema"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Rigtsal writes, But in actuality, the intrinsic awareness of Dzogchen is not produced or initiated bycauses and conditions, for the potential of pure being and primal awareness isintrinsically present and manifests spontaneously. Apply effort to cultivate the sutric approach to buddha but allow not even a whit ofaspiration to arise regarding the pure presence of rigpa. The culture of monasticism, preferred by the Tibetans since the second propagation ofthe dharma in Tibet, may be a superior way of life in comparison with liberal marketcapitalism, but it does not specifically facilitate experiential understanding of the nature ofmind or spontaneous release in the timeless moment of the here and now more than doesany other culture. Insofar as the Tibetan monasteries drew in all types of minds from allsocial classes, those minds were all expected to enter the tunnel of learning that began withthe sutras and ended with Vajrayana praxis. That curriculum contained no element that onits own could supply the wherewithal of Garab Dorje’s first precept—recognition of thenature of mind. Buddhist (and also Bon) monasticism had greatly overshadowed andsuppressed the old shamanism that did in fact contain no small measure of experiential andinitiatory skillful means.In order that all applicants diligently settle down to a monastically based life of study,reflection, and contemplation, they must possess an inner conviction that the progressivepath of the Vajrayana does indeed lead to consummate Dzogchen; skillful introduction togoals and techniques provides and supports that conviction. Pema Rigtsal explains: Whether we wish to meditate through inseparable shamata and vipasyana in theultimate Dzogchen manner, or whether we seek the five supersensory powers andtemporary happiness in the realms of the gods or men, first, in order to become fit forthe task, we need to cultivate the mind, just as we need to cultivate a field to prepare itfor crops. If we train in shamata at the beginning, we prepare for the pure presence ofDzogchen. To reveal that vision we need to have confidence in meditation. If we lack suchconfidence, we will not be able to remove the veil of dualistic delusion. What we call“meditation” is nothing but a confident view, keeping pure presence fixed leisurelywithin that view. When we have gained confidence in meditation, all the phenomena ofsamsara, nirvana, and the path from one to the other arise as forms of emptiness,apparent yet nonexistent. Those forms are the path, and traversing it there is neitherhatred for an enemy nor love for a friend, neither hope for nirvana nor fear of samsara.Moreover, when our potential for such meditation is realized, both samsara andnirvana are bound together in the one cosmic seed, free of all conceptual elaboration,and whatever we have specified, focused on, imagined, referenced, or elaborated will"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"gradually vanish, like mist dissipating in the sky. But in this work, insofar as Vajrayana and Dzogchen are considered side by side, in thesame breath, as it were, the author lets the cat out of the bag when it is made clear thatdirect experience of the nature of mind cannot be induced while under a cloud of dualisticthinking on any of the nine approaches, which include Cutting Through and Direct Crossing: Applying ourselves to a process with the impure delusions of the vision of ordinarybeings, or with the pure or impure vision of yogins or yoginis, as the case may be, oreven with the Buddha’s pure vision, there is no way to avoid the distinctions inherentin the rejection of some sensory appearances, the acceptance of antidotes, thegraduation of stages and paths, and the difference between karmic cause and effect. And in The Heart-Essence of Vimalamitra, Longchenpa says, Buddha will never be attained on the paths of the nine graduated approaches byengaging in their view, meditation, and conduct. Why not? Because in the views of thenine approaches, there is only intellectual conjecture that is sometimes convincing andsometimes not, but which can never induce the naked essence. In this context, Pema Rigtsal explains, This pure presence is primordially free of conceptual elaboration and is thecontemplation of the minds of all the buddhas. Putting any effort into purifying it oradulterating it by concepts tends to conceal its nature and is counterproductive. Weneed to abandon all effort, along with deductive reasoning and speculative concepts. Shamata meditation technique is not exempt from this blanket rejection of all contrivedmeditation methods: During formal contemplation, gross happiness and sadness will not arise, but when weget up from shamata, the joy or the pain will come as before. Just as we contain a heapof dust by sitting down slowly on it, but upon our getting up, the dust arises in clouds,in the concentrated absorption of child’s play, gross thoughts are stopped for a while,and we seem to experience happiness, but when we arise from the concentration, wefind that more gross thoughts intrude than before. Shamata, concentrated absorption, does not induce recognition of the nature of mind, but itcan provide a relative calm in which to appreciate the profound refinements of culturalVajrayana. Indeed no cause or condition can make manifest the realization of pureawareness as the ground from which all causal phenomena arise. However, it is thedefining belief of this latter-day Dzogchen lineage that the rigzin-lama is the doorway intothe natural state of mind, the timeless moment of the here and now:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" To find the natural state of mind that is the great perfection, there is no other way thanthrough a lama. Furthermore, we need to depend upon such a one with faith, purevision, and devotion. The rigzin-lama is he in whom the inexpressible nature of mind effloresces as a constantillusory display of clear light. Or rather it is he whom we recognize as buddha: If we recognize our lama as buddha, then we will receive the blessings of buddha; ifwe recognize our lama as a yogin, then we will receive the blessings of a yogin; and ifwe see our lama as an ordinary human being, then we will receive no blessing at all. In this way those of “middling acumen,” those who do not realize the nature of mindimmediately it is pointed out to them, those who immerse themselves in the religio-culturalmodes of the tradition, attain the understanding of the spaciousness of pure presence wherethe dichotomy of relative and absolute no longer occurs. As Rongzompa says in Applyingthe Mahayana Method, For those who are unable to remain in the natural state that is the great perfection, weteach the mode of striving. Even though they practice that graduated, progressivemode, their view is still based in Dzogchen. Since the great bliss of the luminous mindis the root of all experience, it has the power to cure every sickness that afflicts us. Those who cannot abide in effortless Dzogchen are taught the path of endeavor thatrequires exertion. In the Dzogchen view, they will also succeed. In this way, a life of meditation praxis is open to all, on any of the nine levels of approach,each involving a different lifestyle. On the sutric path, Buddhist culture induces somehappiness in this lifetime and prepares those of middling acumen for death and the adventof the bardos, in which buddhahood may indeed be attained, and failing that, a betterrebirth. Making no clear distinction between the psychological and the cultural, the ninelevels of the Vajrayana path vary according to the manner of cultural conditioning. Thedharma agenda in the Nyingma scheme of things, therefore, is to provide socially beneficialcultural activity for people across a range of differing aspirations and personality types.The specific modes offered are monastic, householder, and renunciate. The activity in thesevarying lifestyles, through time, may modify our karma, change our habits, and therebyinduce a better rebirth, but it will not in itself take us an iota closer to Dzogchen. If andwhen these monks, bodhisattvas, and yogins and yoginis on the graduated path becomeaware of the nature of mind in the Dzogchen view and fall into the state of nonmeditation,they do not drop the lifestyle that is consistent with their Buddhist vows. Consonant withthe atiyoga precept “without acceptance or rejection,” they continue on the graduated pathof the sutras without changing anything at all. But in a mind suffused by Dzogchen view and"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"meditation, the precept of nonaction necessarily engages, and although, from the outsider’spoint of view, a monk or bodhisattva may still seem to be striving on the graduated path,internally the Dzogchen ethos has come to be the apex of his or her outlook, presiding overany other approach.What this boils down to in practice for the Tibetans is that if their initiatory experiencehas not provided them with the Dzogchen view and its corollary of nonmeditation, then theymust be satisfied with the daily round of their religious culture. Their religious practicemay consist of the ascetic hermetic lifestyle of yogins practicing the creative stage or thefulfillment stage. Or it may consist of the lifestyle of neophytes practicing ngondropreparatory practices in a semiretreat situation; of lay tantrika ngakpas performing endlessrituals designed to attain buddha or, more likely, to benefit themselves and others on amaterial plane; of householders committed to their family and professional duties anddeeply engaged in their devotions and good works; or of sutric meditators who live a purelifestyle, ordained or not, engaged essentially in constant shamata or vipasyana meditation.In old Tibet it could have been any of these styles of religious occupation, all denominatedas gradual methods leading to enlightenment. In the Dzogchen view, however, they aremerely forms of religious culture to be bathed in the illumination that the Dzogchen viewprovides.For all these religious people, Dzogchen is approached from outside and below as a goalonly to be invoked in prayer, a carrot extended beyond the donkey’s nose to make him run.In H.H. the Dalai Lama’s famous exposition of Dzogchen at Lerab Ling in France, forinstance, he spoke mainly round about Dzogchen, describing it from the platform of thegraduated path. Naturally enough, from that point of view, he stressed the cultural aspect ofDzogchen, the Vajrayana basis and groundwork, the context of lama worship and devotion,rather than providing the essential precepts of the view and meditation. Perhaps thisemphasis on the maturation of the student’s mind is derived from the necessity in theTibetan monastic environment to cultivate the untrained minds of Tibetan nomads andfarmers by means, for example, of the Madhyamaka dialectic. But reasoning does not leadto the recognition of the nondual nature of mind. As Patrul Rinpoche makes very clear in hisThe Three Incisive Precepts, the Dzogchen method is grounded in experience. Those whocannot recognize what is immediately in front of their nose here and now can, perhaps,recognize the clear light in the bardo of reality. Otherwise, in both this life and the next,they should immerse themselves in the religious culture of Vajrayana, in study of the sutrasand Buddhist logic on the progressive path of spiritual materialism. In this way the DalaiLama is here in line with the mainstream of Dzogchen teachers in the latter days in stressingthe relativist, space-time aspect of Dzogchen rather than its mystical nondual core.The proponents of this sutric Dzogchen design their lives according to the graduated pathdescribed by the Mahayana sutras, fill it with the ethos of the bodhisattva vow, and striveon the difficult path of self-sacrifice. They may take the logical step of ordination andpractice tantric ritual in order to speed up the process of attainment of their altruistic goals.In that arena the processes of karmic causality are dominant and all-consuming, and the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"slow process of purification of karmic conditioning—or rather the reconditioning of themind—proceeds over many lifetimes or for eons. In the valleys of Tibet, therefore,Buddhist religious activity was the form demonstrated by Dzogchen yogins and yoginis,particularly before the Chinese invasion, when Tibet’s political structure was theocratic. Inthe Himalayan borderlands—in Dolpo for example—farming or yak herding may be theprincipal activity of the Dzogchen yogin. In the exiled refugee community, he or she may bea doctor or a priest, a trader or a farmer, an artisan or shopkeeper.The three-in-one ideal that Dudjom Rinpoche has taught, particularly in his commentaryon Ascertaining the Three Vows by Ngari Panchen, is predicated upon the assumption thatthe yogin has been inducted into the three levels of Tibetan Vajrayana praxis. These threeconsist of the sutric ordination that comes with a disciplinary codex, the bodhisattva vow ofthe perfection of wisdom, and the tantric samayas that imply the predominance of primalawareness. These three sets of vows may be related to outer, inner, and secret levels ofpractice. The monastic training is the outer; the flexible, superior moral training is theinner; and in secret the tantric samaya vows are sustained. These three levels are integratedinto a single lifestyle and religious persona that we can identify in the Nyingma yoginwhether dressed as a monk, layman, or ngakpa. The activity of this society of religiouspractitioners constitutes the culture of the Nyingma school, and the praxis of this culture isindependent and continues whether or not it is illumined by the Dzogchen view. If it isindeed infused by the Dzogchen view, then it becomes the karmic form presented by thespontaneity of the view. The culture becomes the karma that is infused with light andawareness and eventually is exhausted in the rainbow body or body of light. If theDzogchen view as an existential reality has not yet suffused that culture, then, as mentionedabove, the individual cultivates the cultural form with the certainty of progressing along thepath of the bodhisattva and refining the karma that may lead to a higher rebirth.It seems evident and of huge importance to the vitality and continuation of the essence ofthe Tibetan tradition—Dzogchen atiyoga—that it should not become mixed up withculturally specific qualities and modes. If Dzogchen remains a factor of Vajrayana whileVajrayana remains a bundle of quasi-shamanic Central Asian concepts and quasi-Hindutantric rituals and concepts, it continues to be unattractive and irrelevant to thecontemporary global mainstream of science and technology. Some lamas of the tradition,particularly Dudjom Rinpoche and Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, showing the qualitiesof flexibility and incisive responsiveness that demonstrate their mastery, adapted thetraditional forms of teaching and exposition to the needs of their Western disciples. Withthe difficult recognition that Westerners were not to be monks or religious practitioners inthe Himalayan mold, the realization dawned that Western spiritual culture (and particularlythe hippie culture that greeted the refugee lamas in India) needed only a minute shift ofaspiration to allow the magic of the Dzogchen view to work. These masters saw no needfor Western cultural forms to be radically changed and transmogrified into some kind ofTibetan clone-culture, but rather, by a simple redirection toward the ideal of Dzogchen,those in whom the natural state of being was incipiently blossoming could be infused by its"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"illuminating spaciousness and awareness.Westerners gazing closely at Tibetan monasticism, while retaining deep respect—evento a fault—tend to perceive it as a kindergarten stage. The cultural function of themonasteries has changed in the refugee society (although not much in Tulku Pema Rigtsal’sgompa), becoming the means whereby the traditional culture is conserved and sustainedparticularly through the education of boys who have no initial intention of becoming monksbut who cannot afford, or do not possess, the means of attaining a Western-style educationin a modern institution. But the epithet “kinder-garten” not only denominates the function ofeducating and socializing children, but also the training of the few monks, whose karma issuited to a lifetime of study, recollection, and meditation, in the Mahayana sutras, inBuddhist logic, in spiritual aspiration, in physical and moral training, and in the priestlyfunctions, such as sanctifying rites of passage.It is unfortunate that certain ancient Buddhist monastic and atavistic Tibetan attitudes areconserved in the monasteries. Faint traces of these attitudes peer through Pema Rigtsal’sanecdotes in his text. Buddhist societies have always upheld the superiority of the monasticideal and its necessity, and monks of course are the first to support such a view.Denigration of the lay option and the “sadhu” mode follow automatically. The superior andslightly disparaging attitude toward women—including nuns—is sometimes painfully felt,by feminists in particular. Materialism and its financial status-structured hierarchy ispresented—and disdained—as a particularly Western affliction, while it should be evidentby now that Asia, in general, and Tibetans, in particular, are plagued with grossmaterialistic attitudes. Such attitudes are held in the first place due to naïve adulation of thehigh technology developed in the West and only recently available in Asia, and in thesecond because wealth and conspicuous consumption are seen to indicate the favor of thegods—and therefore merit and virtue—among the wealthy.So, finally, The Great Secret of Mind contains secret Dzogchen precepts hidden amongexcerpts from a manual of sutric Buddhism together with some gems of tantric instruction.Some readers will understand the sutric path of monasticism in which Tulku Pema Rigtsalis situated as the cultural context, and Dzogchen Ati as the mystical experience unfoldingwithin it, unmarked by monasticism. To put it another way, consonant with Mahayanadogma, the temporal sutric path provides the form and the Dzogchen view-cum-meditationthe emptiness. The sutric path, determined by karma, provides the time-space context,which in timeless awareness of the here and now becomes the pure presence of Dzogchen.The lesson in this for the post-Renaissance, post-Reformation West, where religious andlay cultures have been confounded for several hundred years, and in the developed FarEastern societies into which those attitudes have been transposed, is that Dzogchen yoginsand yoginis are completely anonymous, free of any attribute by which they could berecognized. Their activity cannot be defined. Their behavior cannot be described. Theirconduct does not accord with any agenda. They wear no badge, or hat, by which they can belabeled or compartmentalized. If their karma is not exhausted in a rainbow body, theiractivity will appear from the outside to be consonant with their personal karma. If the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"spontaneity that is naturally induced by the recognition of the alpha-purity of all experiencedemonstrates an egoless awareness of the dynamic necessity of the totality, cushioned bythe vibration of a bodhisattva, it will probably be appreciated only subliminally by thosewho witness it.The last word is from Pema Rigtsal: In reality, therefore, all phenomena are merely mental labels, and in reality not eventhe smallest thing exists to be cultivated or rejected. Yogins and yoginis who have thisview pay no attention to their own level of accomplishment regarding eitherattachment to the objective, material aspect of nominal experience or to the degree ofany emotional attachment.

I have explained the view according to my own understanding,using words that are easy to follow, and entwining them with life stories. In this way, I havedone my best to make Dzogchen as clear and accessible as possible. Moreover, I haveexplained the view, meditation, and conduct of Dzogchen in accord with the attitudes of thepresent age. I hope that this presentation will help those who are studying and enquiringinto the dharma in a very broad and unbiased way to increase their understanding ofDzogchen in a way unlike any before. On top of that, I have the great hope that it will teachpeople how to easily integrate the daily activities of eating, lying down, moving around,and sitting into the practice and how to bring temporary happiness and suffering into theambit of Dzogchen. This is also the special quality of the meaning explained in this book.Every single one of us wants happiness and abhors suffering. What use, therefore, isfleeting and constantly changing, defiled happiness? When one has the aspiration to obtainultimate, permanent happiness, it is extremely important to gain a foothold on the path toliberation in this life, particularly by practicing the profound path of Dzogchen. Other thanthat, as explained above, those wishing to enjoy a happy and pleasant life must cultivate thecauses for that—loving-kindness and compassion—and the genuine source of those twothings is Dzogchen.Furthermore, at present many millions of people are suffering from depression, HIV, andother more severe diseases. Depression (or disturbed mind-energy), for example, is havinga highly injurious effect on the overall well-being, development, and harmony of society asa whole. Depression, together with high blood-pressure and liver complaints, and so on,are, in short, all illnesses connected with mind. Mainly due to the affliction of mind bydisturbing emotions, we compete among ourselves; and, due to the increase in thepopulation—not only in cities but also in villages—people’s living spaces have becomevery restricted, and the drinking water, air, and so on, have become polluted. As a resultmany people’s mind-energy has become disturbed.Actually, illnesses and suffering due to substances in the environment afflict us only to acertain, limited extent, but because the minds of sentient beings can scarcely bear evensmall external negative conditions, small initial irritations can snowball into a huge amountof additional suffering and can sometimes become so unbearable that suicide may result. If,therefore, one has the practice of Dzogchen in all such situations, it will be of vast benefit.For that reason, if one has the habit of understanding suffering to be self-envisioned, onewill thereby be able to make all occurrences of unwanted illnesses and suffering naturallydissolve. If we remain detached from taking external happiness and suffering to be real,even if some kind of calamity, such as an earthquake or war, suddenly occurs, our mind"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"will be able to abide peacefully, naturally, and at ease. We will then be able to benefitothers greatly. For these reasons, I consider this book to be something important.MEETING WITH MY GURUS My greatest fortune is having met solely with gurus who are enlightened beings appearingin human form. Although their conduct and lifestyle is something I cannot judge,nevertheless in my perception each guru has an amazing unique conduct and lifestyle. I havebowed at the feet of some fourteen guru lamas, and there are also a few more gurus withwhom I have made dharma connections. My main gurus are Lord of Refuge, Dudjom JigdralYeshe Dorje Rinpoche, the master who was prophesied in the treasure scriptures to havethe power to lead beings to Ngayab Ling merely by their seeing his body and hearing hisname; Lord of Refuge, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche; Lord of Refuge, Dodrupchen Rinpoche;Lord of Refuge, Trulshik Rinpoche; Lord of Refuge, Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche; Lordof Refuge, Drubwang Penor Rinpoche; Lord of Refuge, Domang Yangtang Rinpoche;Khenchen Pema Tsewang Rinpoche; my sublime father, the second incarnation of PemaDewai Gyelpo, Pema Jigme Namgyel Rinpoche; my paternal uncle Tsewang Rinpoche;Khenchen Dawai Wozer Rinpoche; and Khenchen Pema Choying Khyabdal Rinpoche. Iwill now describe the conduct and deeds of my lords of refuge.KHENPO CHOYING KHYABDAL RINPOCHE Before I met Khen Rinpoche, I had heard that he was totally carefree—free of allconventional responses—but when I met him, I saw that he was even more unpredictablethan I had been told. At that time, he was old, thin, and not very strong. His room was anold wooden hut four meters square with nothing more than a small wooden box for his bedand a table in front of it, and he was just sitting there cross-legged on the bed. He waswearing old stained woolen robes, and when you looked at his possessions, there was noteven five hundred rupees worth of things there in the room. When I had heard about hisliving conditions, I could not believe it: but now, when I saw it with my own eyes, I had nochoice.Having offered three prostrations, I presented my offering scarf and the letter ofintroduction from Khen Rinpoche (Khenchen Dawai Wozer) and requested teaching on TheWay of Entering the Mahayana by Rongzompa. When I explained why and how I had cometo meet him, he paid little attention, and combined with a scolding, he gave me oralinstructions, pointing out my hidden faults. After looking for a few seconds at the envelopeof Khen Rinpoche’s introductory letter, he threw it away. “We used to call him ‘LongEars,’” he said. “I never called him ‘Khenpo,’ and he didn’t like me calling him ‘KhenRinpoche.’”When I think about it, Khenchen Pema Choying Khyabdal Rinpoche was totally different"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"from worldly people. In general, it is the way of things that whoever one may be, one ishappy when praised and angry when criticized. Khen Rinpoche was not like that. Even ifone were to say to him, “Everyone praises your excellent qualities!” he would act deeplyoffended and say, “If they see excellent qualities in me, why can’t they be like me? I haveno need of praise. I know what I’m like. I have no need of criticism. I know who I am.”When he would speak like that, I would feel like a debater sitting in front of the lordNagarjuna—I had no idea what to say and could only sit and watch.During that period, “perceiving the lama as buddha,” as taught in the oral instructions andso on, came about naturally without any effort on my part, and tears would come to my eyes.I came to understand that his scolding of Khen Rinpoche Dawai Wozer was a skillful meansto cut through my own pride.In short, merely through his actions and way of living, I was also able to come tounderstand that samsara has no essence and that one needs only to cast aside self-graspingand the eight worldly obsessions. Sometimes when he gave oral instructions to students, hewould look at a student’s conduct and show anger and other emotions; it was clear that atall times he was never separate from Dzogchen’s four modes of freely resting, abiding withthe three doors naturally wide open, carefree and at ease.While receiving The Way of Entering the Mahayana, it was, due to the text itself beinga tremendous blessing and the teacher being highly skilled in explaining dharma, as if I hadarrived in a totally new world. Previously, the assertions of the different systems of dogmaand the various different explanations of the great scholars had seemed contradictory to me,and I had struggled a lot. But due to the teaching and great kindness and compassion of thisteacher, it was as if I had been relieved of an illness, and I felt a great comfort.From then on, I understood that all the teaching of sutra and mantra (the tantra class) iscontained within Dzogchen above them and also that all the nine approaches aredevolutions below Dzogchen. Having understood that, unbiased faith unlike anything I hadfelt before naturally arose in me toward the ocean of texts of sutra, mantra, and the tantraclass.I came to understand that everything is a means to lead us to the path of Dzogchen—theteaching was not just dry words to which I had to pay lip service, as I had thought before,but actually brings us to realization. I also came to understand that all approaches arecontained within Dzogchen, and I realized why the crucial points of all practices just comedown to Dzogchen.As a result, a deep-rooted certainty arose within me, and I developed unshakable faith inthe teaching and teacher. Sometimes, all of a sudden, the understanding of these presentappearances as being unreal and illusory would arise in my mindstream.While we were studying the fifth chapter of The Way of Entering the Mahayana, at onepoint Khen Rinpoche’s personal experience blazed forth, and, when asking questions, Iarrived at a state of naked pure presence unlike anything I had experienced before.Afterward I gained a mountainlike certainty that, beyond this, there is nothing more toresolve and nothing new to understand."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"KHEN RINPOCHE DAWAI WOZER Besides being learned in an infinity of textual traditions and having perfected the excellentqualities of a monk, Supreme Khen Rinpoche Dawai Wozer immersed himself in Dzogchennight and day. Unstained by the eight worldly obsessions, he stayed in solitude and therejoyfully took hold of the victory banner of accomplishment. He lived as a hidden yogin-practitioner.Whenever I met him, a special feeling would come over me. Whatever teaching andadvice Khen Rinpoche gave, it was always extremely touching. For example, one day whenhe was speaking about the benefits of Longchenpa’s Seven Treasuries, such strong faithwas induced in me that my hair stood up on end, my eyes became wet with tears, and I saidto Khen Rinpoche that I was going to try to have the Seven Treasuries written out in gold.He replied, “It is an excellent project to have the Seven Treasuries written out in gold, butthe most important thing is to live what they teach, and it’s best if you just get woodenprinting blocks carved for them.”Similarly, one day he told the life story of Kunu Lama Tenzin Gyeltsen—how for thirteenyears Kunu Lama wandered from place to place, meeting teachers, going on pilgrimage,listening, contemplating and meditating on an ocean of different texts, and staying in placeswhere he was totally unknown. Khen Rinpoche praised this kind of lifestyle tremendously. Itold him, “I’m also going to do that.” He replied, “That is an admirable aspiration. But youshould know that for those who are realized, it makes no difference whether they are on themove or stay in one place, and for people like us, it is best not to travel around to manydifferent places; it’s better if we stay in one place. Stay in one place and realize thedharma!” As everyone knows well, I am not subject to sudden impulsive thinking, but theway Khen Rinpoche used to teach, his proclamations of truth would shake me up and turnmy mind around.In short, the little knowledge I now have and my external appearance as a dharmapractitioner, directly and indirectly, are solely due to the kindness of Khen Dawai WozerRinpoche. He has influenced me more than anyone else in my life, and I acknowledge himas one of my root gurus endowed with the threefold kindness I can never forget.With regard to how I received Dzogchen pointing-out instructions, one time when I wasreceiving teaching on Longchenpa’s The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, I said to KhenRinpoche, “We’re already about halfway through the text, but so far, even though Iunderstand the words, I don’t have even the slightest understanding or experience about thereal meaning of pure presence [rigpa]. What should I do?” Khen Rinpoche then said, “It’snot a problem. Supplicate Longchenpa one-pointedly. Chant the root text continuously andthen at some point, due to some adventitious condition, you will recognize rigpa.“For example, the great scholar and undisputed reincarnation Dza Patrul Rinpoche,although he had relied for a very long time on genuine teachers without ever parting fromthem, he recognized rigpa, the nature of mind, in the following way: Once when PatrulRinpoche was coming down from Shri Singha, he met Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, who was"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"journeying along wearing a sheepskin with a sword hitched around his waist. AlthoughPatrul Rinpoche didn’t lack faith in Do Rinpoche, he thought, ‘What’s wrong with wearingclothes that are in accordance with the dharma?’ Do Khyentse knew what he was thinkingand all of a sudden grabbed him by the throat and shook him back and forth, shouting, ‘Olddog! Old dog!’ At that very moment, Patrul Rinpoche recognized rigpa, the nature of mind.“Likewise, even when the famous Khenpo Tubten was made a Khenchen (teaching abbot)and was teaching sutra and mantra to a huge gathering of students, he had not recognized thenature of mind. One day when he was going to perform a ritual in a village, he slippedwhile walking over a small bridge and fell into the river below: at that very moment, hearrived at rigpa and came to know the nature of mind.”By telling me many such stories, he made my perception change so that I often thought,“That will happen to me one day.” A few days later, in a dream I arrived in a transparentempty cave, like the small tunnels that they build on mountain roads these days. In themiddle of the cave was a stone trough filled with fresh and old blood. I thought it must be aplace where Hindus make sacrifices, like they do for the black goddess Kali in Nepal. Iwas terrified and revolted and thought, “I absolutely must drive these terrible spiritsaway!” With the divine dignity of Vajrakilaya, I uttered HUNG four times in order to expelthe spirits, and I scattered oil-grain around. At the same time, sounds of horns, drums,trumpets, and so on, naturally resounded, and with my mind mixing with space, I remainedin rigpa. After that my fear and revulsion completely vanished. The next morning, I toldKhen Rinpoche, and he said, “What was the state of rigpa like?” I was left without anythingwhatsoever to say. Then Khen Rinpoche said, “Ah! That’s it!” and he was extremelypleased. That recognition was attained through the blessing of the lama.DUNGSE THINLEY NORBU RINPOCHE Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche is the lord of those skilled in the meaning of samsara andnirvana’s being of equal taste as the dharmakaya and apparent existence appearing asinstruction. He keeps the form of a great hidden yogin and bestows Dzogchen pithinstructions on his fortunate disciples. He possesses some extraordinary qualities.In 1997, one day Rinpoche came on pilgrimage to the Swayambhu and Boudhanath stupaswith a large group of students. In the evening, after returning to his residence, he gave someadvice and dharma talk. He acted slightly drunk from drinking wine and gave nakedpointing-out instructions. The way he taught then was quite different from the way lamasnormally teach. He taught how to sustain rigpa with great naturalness at the very momentattachment and aversion arise. Upon receiving Rinpoche’s instructions, I thought, “Todayall of these people recognized rigpa. How fortunate they are!” and I became inexpressiblyhappy and joyful.Another time, when I met Rinpoche in California, in the evening, when we were makinga feast offering and Rinpoche was teaching, he scolded me, saying, “It’s true you’re verylearned, but you’re too proud!” and he mocked me. One day he said not just once, but again"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"and again, “It’s no use being a great scholar. You need realization. Thinking you’re verylearned will only harm that, so it would probably be best if you stopped your textualteaching.” It made me think that I should offer a pledge to practice, so I asked Rinpoche,“Would it be best to do a one-year Direct Crossing [togel] retreat, or a one-year longretreat reciting the entire Nyingma tantras? Please tell me, Rinpoche.” “Both are excellent,so do both,” he replied. “Which one should I do first?” I asked. He seemed displeased andthe next day said again, “Teaching texts to students has spoiled you!”I then thought to myself, “Before, when I knew nothing at all, and Khen Rinpoche DawaiWozer told me to teach the dharma from texts, I said to him, ‘I don’t know anything myself,so how can I teach?’ and he replied, ‘When I first came to India, I wasn’t as learned asyou,’ and he encouraged me and gave me confidence. As a result, for about seventeen years,I have been teaching fifty or so monks without a break. It seems that by now I have fulfilledKhen Rinpoche’s instruction, and it is time to fulfill Dungse Rinpoche’s command.”So I said to Rinpoche, “From now on, I vow not to teach even a single verse of dharma.”For a little while, Rinpoche didn’t say anything. Then he said, “If I tell you not to teach thedharma, won’t I have negative karma? I’m not saying that. I’m saying you need to abandonthe pride of thinking ‘I’m so learned.’”Later on that evening, after we had made the feast offering, and I had returned to myroom, I sat in bed thinking. “Today, something really shocking occurred. I wonder whatwill happen if Rinpoche really makes me vow not to teach anymore? If I give up teachingthe dharma, my life’s work will be at an end. Why? Because the source of funding of themonastery is the West and Taiwan and other places where I teach the dharma. If I don’tteach there, I’ll stop going there. Likewise, if I stop teaching the monks at the monastery,even if I stay there, my whole purpose of being there will be over. I’ll also have to give upexplaining what to adopt and what to abandon, virtue and vice and moral conduct at theVajra Guru Mantra Accumulation ceremonies and other dharma gatherings outside Humla.I’ll have no work, and it’ll be like I’m already old. From today on, I will have nothing to doother than stay in an uninhabited retreat place, and I would be committed to staying there forthe rest of my life.”Pondering what would happen, I stayed awake for many hours. I felt very nervous, andwhen I thought about it carefully, I saw that, just as Rinpoche had said, I had a very strongattachment to teaching the meaning of texts. Even though I believed I was not proud aboutbeing learned, as Rinpoche had said, it became clear that I was actually so stronglyattached to texts that I could not bear to part from them. As a result, I understood thatwhether it was attachment to virtue or vice, it was still attachment and a direct obscurationof the dharmakaya. From then on, seeing my own faults, my attachment to texts decreased.The students of Dungse Rinpoche’s lineage have an amazing understanding and quality.DODRUP RINPOCHE"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Dodrup Rinpoche is one of the great gurus who showed me enormous kindness inbestowing upon me empowerment, oral transmission, and instruction. Not only that, but inparticular, I received his blessings in dreams and visions. When I was staying in a three-year retreat and had almost finished the recitation of Vajrakilaya, one day, in my dream,Dodrup Rinpoche was sitting on top of a throne inside a small shrine room, chanting whileplaying the damaru and bell. I and a few other monks were there, and at one point in thechanting, Rinpoche said, “It’s now time to pay homage, so make the mudras.” Then all of asudden I was naked. I fell on the floor, and my two legs went around my waist andreappeared at the front. My right leg extended over my left thigh, and my left leg extendedover my right thigh. They wrapped behind my waist and reappeared at the front, forming afull knot around my waist, and I was transformed into Vajrakilaya. When I woke up, it waslike I had no waist, and for a long time I had the experience of my body’s being empty form.Further, in another dream during that three-year retreat, Dodrup Rinpoche was sitting in atent on top of several flower-covered mounds in a grassy meadow. I told him that I hadcompleted the three-year retreat and its recitation, and he said, “Now you need to recite1,100,000 Arapatsana [Manjushri] mantras. If you do that, it will be like a sharp swordthat will cut through all obstacles to the accomplishment of your activities.”Later, when I told Dodrup Rinpoche about those dreams, he said they were veryauspicious. I told him, “I want to practice the realization of Manjushri, but there are somany different texts. Which one would be best?” Rinpoche then replied, “My guru is YugogChadral. He considered the Manjushri meditation practice from the tantric tradition to bevery precious, so do the entire recitation and accomplishment for that.” So then I stayed inretreat for about three months, doing the recitation of the peaceful aspect of the tantrictradition of Manjushri. I accumulated exactly one million mantras in that recitation, and,together with the “amendment” recitation, the total was exactly 1,100,000. At the end Irealized that the Dodrup Rinpoche who had appeared in my dreams was identical to theactual present Dodrup Rinpoche, and I believe that the guru actually came in person in mydreams.DOMANG YANGTANG RINPOCHE In general, in the context of the secret mantra Vajrayana and, in particular, in Dzogchen Ati,one sees one’s root guru as the Buddha in person, the all-pervasive lord of the mandala,and places his or her commands at the crown of one’s head. This is a crucial point,showing that the blessings of the wisdom lineage are transferred solely from the guru. Youcan see this clearly from whichever guru’s life story you look at.In 1959, during the terrible chaos in Tibet, the great beings who upheld the teaching,monasteries, and teaching centers were struck a vicious blow. During that time, placing hisroot guru, Lingtrul Rinpoche, on the crown of his head, Domang Yangtang Rinpocheremained in his monastery even though he knew his life was at risk, and he had the chanceto escape to India. During the Cultural Revolution, though free of the slightest fault, he took"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"upon himself all the hardships of the fighting and conflict. For twenty-three years, he wasincarcerated in Dardo Ranga prison. During that time, the government imprisoned the greatgurus, tulkus, khenpos, and most of the high-standing people under appalling conditions,deceiving them with lies, such as telling them that they would educate them in the CulturalRevolution, give them certain rights and different positions, and quickly release them. Sometimid and jealous Tibetan people criticized the dharma and the gurus and pretended thatthey believed in the Cultural Revolution, and some humiliated the lamas, saying howshameful they were, while those with faith in the dharma, standing by, became extremelydisheartened. During that time, Yangtang Rinpoche remained unmoving, like a greatmountain in the face of snowstorms. He was victorious over all obstacles, and no matterhow much they tortured and abused him, he remembered his guru’s command and tookDzogchen as his heart practice.At that time, secretly, he relied on Sera Yangtrul Rinpoche as a teacher and shared hisexperience and realization with him. Many signs of the qualities of experience andrealization appeared increasingly, and those signs became legendary in that area.Although Rinpoche has many mind treasures, from among the different texts he composedin this lifetime, the text entitled Instructions on the Great Perfection: A Brief Summary ofView, Meditation, and Conduct has the power of inconceivable blessings. It iscommensurate with Patrul Rinpoche’s The Three Incisive Precepts, the sole practice ofone hundred scholars and a thousand siddhas.Although I was born in this period when the five degenerations are rampant, due to theblessings of having met with gurus such as Domang Yangtang Rinpoche, those who are fullyendowed with the wisdom of Dzogchen, I can count myself as a being of great good fortune.I obtained the blessings of empowerment, oral transmission, and instruction from thisRinpoche, and in addition he gave me some profound advice and encouragement withregard to both dharma and mundane affairs. In particular, it was he who said to me, “If youcan write a book, it will be highly beneficial to the young people of this age,” and it wasmainly because of that that I took on the work of composing this book."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Great Secret of Mind WE BOW TO THE BUDDHA BHAGAWAN SAMANTABHADRA!"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"1. The View 1.1 THE NATURE OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD ALL INTELLIGENT human beings are united in their desire for happiness in this lifetime andthe next. But the cause of happiness, the way to obtain happiness, is a matter of broaddisagreement. Some people try to obtain happiness in business, some in politics, some byfarming the land, some in government jobs, and some with machines and technology.Others, driven by bad karma, even try to find it as thieves, gangsters, or terrorists.All anyone ever wants is happiness, which first of all means freedom from presentsuffering. Most people want this for themselves, and they think that they know what is goodfor themselves and their community, and what is good for their children, partners, andfamily. Essentially they want just four things: to get rich and have money in the bank, tohave a healthy body and a quick mind, to have a good reputation, and to be appreciated andrespected by the people around them. What they get, however, is the contrary: poverty,pain, criticism, and anonymity, and they are bitterly disappointed. They find it extremelydifficult to fulfill their desires according to their dreams, and, even if they do accomplishsomething, at the end of the day, they lapse into regret and remorse.At the time of Shakyamuni Buddha, there was a rich landlord called “Pelkye.” In thosedays, in the sacred land of India, princes, landowners, and those who could afford it hadmany consorts, and their status and renown was measured according to the number ofwomen they possessed. Pelkye had eight consorts, and each of these bore him a son and adaughter, making sixteen children in all. His eight sons were given splendid weddingparties, and his eight daughters were married into rich families. For years he enjoyedcommunity, wealth, and reputation together, but eventually he became old and senile. Hiseyes dimmed, his hearing faded, and, as his power diminished, he could not function asbefore. His lovely women, who previously had followed him like shadows, and hischildren, who had catered to his every whim, now ignored and despised him, and the oldman became depressed. “I have cherished my children and given them everything,” hethought, “both love and money. I have covered my women with expensive jewelry anddesigner clothes and now none of them, children or wives, pay me any attention.” Unable tostand his situation, he was filled with deep frustration with the world. But then, spitting itout like a glob of phlegm, he made his way to the feet of the Buddha and there begged themaster to accept him as his disciple. Shakyamuni ordained him, and at the end of his life, heattained constant happiness at the level of an arhat.In A Collection of Elegant Verses, the wise Gendun Chophel expressed it like this:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Constantly bemired in worldly affairs,Life is a cause of fatigue;The dharma is our only consolation,Arising adventitiously within the mind. Kings, presidents, and politicians may rule for decades, but eventually some trivial adversecircumstance brings them down and costs them their status and perhaps their lives. Peopleof wealth and fame have no concern for this life or the next while they accumulate theirfortunes, even risking their lives and breaking the law. They quarrel with their parents andchildren, break up with their partners, and find themselves alienated from family andfriends—all for the sake of money.Even mountainous wealth and universal fame must be left behind at the time of our death.To give our money to others seems unthinkable, and we cannot spend it all upon ourselves.Our children may spend it lavishly and thoughtlessly, drinking and gambling andwomanizing, and seeing how they behave, we lose our sleep and our appetite, and lifebecomes endless suffering. When we berate our children, they ignore us or tell us that it isnone of our business. In the passage of time, partners who have been close to us and lovingbecome estranged and seek new mates. Friends who have been intimate with us and in tunewith each other become enemies for no good reason. Seeing that the world is changeableand undependable for these and many other reasons, people’s minds are fraught withanxiety and world-weariness. In such circumstances, if we are aware of the BuddhaShakyamuni’s teaching, we will surely apply it.If, however, we are unaware of that teaching, we will be unable to overcome oursuffering. We may try to drown it by consuming alcohol and drugs, or by gambling, or someother form of escapism, but although such remedies seem to give some happiness in themoment, actually the happiness they provide is superficial and temporary. To apply suchfalse antidotes is like pouring oil on to fire, a fire that then burns with increased intensity.Besides, consuming alcohol and drugs destroys health and leads to sickness. It also takesaway self-control, and we find ourselves roaming about like mad dogs, deprived of humansociety. Since that condition is self-afflicted, rather than imposed upon us by others, it is acause for further grief. According to this logic, our faults derive from ignorance ofShakyamuni Buddha’s teaching, ignorance of the message that has the potential to overcomesuffering and to nourish the mind.Recently I heard the news of the death of the famous dancer Michael Jackson. He wasbarely fifty years old. Hundreds of people from all over the world gathered to pay homageto him, and likewise I was moved when I heard of his death. But then the words ofShakyamuni Buddha flashed into my mind, that all beings in this world are bound by birth,old age, sickness, and death. If anyone could have escaped from the curse of sickness andsubsequent death, it was Michael Jackson, who was one of the richest men in the UnitedStates and seemingly had all the wealth of the world at his disposal. People say thatMichael had acquired immense wealth from the sale of his CDs and from his stage"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"performances. How was it that someone like that who was admired the world over and wasso fanatically worshipped by innumerable fans that some would die to see him perform—asalmost happened in Taiwan in 1996—how was it that he could not escape the sickness thatled to his early death? If money could extend life, surely in this case it would have done so.Because Michael had gained fame and started his fortune at the age of nine, we mightassume that he had led a life of constant happiness. But as reported by the media, his lifeturned out to be a miserable catalog of litigation, personal tragedy, and grief. The medicalrecords of his autopsy showed that he was a mere fifty kilograms at the time of his death,and his stomach was full of various medicines and completely empty of food. His diseaseseems to have been some kind of self-hatred, manifesting particularly as a dislike for hisown skin color and facial features that was so deep that he had them modified in severalsurgical operations.The truth is that fame and fortune could not provide him with any measure of satisfaction,and the lesson to be learned from Michael’s life is that regardless of the effort weourselves make to be like him in fame and fortune, we too are bound to fail in our quest forhappiness. In the light of evidence of the absence of any substantial essence in the materialworld, therefore, Shakyamuni Buddha could say that, regardless of our status in thisthreefold world, none of us can escape the conditions of birth, old age, sickness, and death.Suffering is caused by emotional affliction—the six neurotic syndromes—and this in turncauses us to take rebirth in one of the six corresponding realms. Shakyamuni went on to saythat from birth, old age, sickness, and death in those six states we suffer an endlessdiversity of suffering: separation from what we love, for example, or the misery ofengagement with what we dislike, the pain of failing to find what we seek, and all the othersufferings of embodiment. Continuing, he then said that in order to escape from all thatgrief, we should depend upon the continuum of emptiness that is the true path. This ismentioned in The Explanatory Sutra of Interdependent Origination: Since the Buddha knows emotional affliction as the cause of suffering and shows usthe antidote to karma and emotional affliction, so he tells us of the supreme liberationwhere the suffering of old age, sickness, and death is absent. We should recognize clearly, therefore, that whether we abide in the human realm or arecaught up in any of the six neurotic syndromes, we are still fenced in by immediateincontestable suffering. Entering the immaculate path defined by the master, ShakyamuniBuddha, we shall be released from the severe suffering of birth, sickness, old age, anddeath in both this life and the next, and with constant effort, we may attain the deathlesspeace of nirvana. All of us, regardless of status, are like Michael Jackson in that we aredominated by emotional traumas that cause suffering. Although on the face of it, the worldmay appear to offer pleasure and beauty, it is imperative that, by relying on buddha-dharma,we recognize that chasing after pleasure is the cause of suffering.In his exposition of the four noble truths, Shakyamuni Buddha taught that sufferingconsists of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Further, there is the doctrine of threefold"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"suffering: The first kind of suffering, the suffering of suffering, is, for example, the grief onefeels upon the death of a loved one. The second kind of suffering, the suffering of change, isillustrated by change in one’s financial status or by the change from enjoyment of good foodto the sickness caused by that same food. The third kind of suffering, the suffering ofconditioned existence or the suffering of embodiment, is the slow change of deteriorationthat accompanies all life, like the slow but sure change from youth to old age.In general, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity—all religions—have the samepotential to bring peace of mind and a happy state. All agree that, to achieve peace of mind,we need to practice some sort of shamata and vipasyana meditation, but having such highaspirations is as far from the actual realization as the earth is from the sky. Some religiouspractitioners are able to suppress the suffering of body and mind temporarily through thevirtue of meditative absorption. Some practitioners of other religions are successful insecuring rebirth in the higher realms of the gods or human beings, which is a little better.But what is the use of that? It is no better than treating the symptoms of the disease insteadof its root cause. The same is true for suffering: we need to eliminate its root cause.1.2 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “INSIDER” AND “OUTSIDER” MEDITATION Most religions offer a simple-minded contemplation that is relevant to a worldly pathdefined by the “outsider” view. This type of meditation, which is found in various forms indifferent religions, can temporarily relieve superficial suffering. It may induce ordinaryclairvoyance, the four levels of concentrated absorption, and even rebirth as a formlessgod. But what kind of liberation is that? What we need is the eradication of the ego-clingingthat is the root cause of suffering. The way to do this has been provided in the teaching ofthe lord of beings, the Bhagawan, the Buddha Shakyamuni, who taught “insider”contemplation. On that path we understand that all experience is empty and unreal and thatcontemplation can accomplish the release wherein there is no longer any ego-clinging. Herethe cause of suffering is eliminated at its very root.The crucial difference between “outsider” and “insider” meditation is that the formerseeks to cut off the branches of suffering, while the latter cuts through the root. Developingan understanding of ego-loss, we attain the various levels and stages, and training in thequalities of contemplation, we proceed to the attainment of buddha. To engage in suchpractice, we need to understand the nature of all phenomena, and since mind is the leader—the dominating factor—in that process, it is essential to know its secret. As the bodhisattvapoet Shantideva says in Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Without knowing the secret of mind,Any pursuit of happiness,Any forsaking of suffering—All that is quite futile."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"1.3 THE FALLACY OF MATERIALISM: HOW THE ACTUALITY CONTRADICTS OUR ASSUMPTIONTHAT OUR HAPPINESS AND SADNESS DEPEND UPON MATERIAL THINGS No one in the sensual, aesthetic, or formless realms has revealed the secret essence of mindexcept the Buddha Shakyamuni. For anyone seeking happiness, the first crucial thing toknow is that mind is the root of all happiness and suffering. This is contrary to our ordinaryhuman assumption because through beginningless time to the present day, we all presumethat our happiness and suffering depend upon external objects. Due to this false assumption,we all search for beautiful things to gaze upon, sweet sounds to listen to, fine aromas toenjoy, subtle tastes to savor, and soft clothes to wear, and so on. In short, everyone, fromthe highest to the lowest, from four-footed creatures to all the birds of the air and evendown to the smallest insects, constantly, day and night, runs in search of objects that theybelieve will provide happiness. Likewise, we assume that suffering depends upon materialobjects or external phenomena, and we manufacture weapons to subdue those externalforces that cause us such suffering. Thinking that this particular external cause can producea particular disease and that particular external cause will hurt us, we are led to believethat if we could only destroy the external physical objects that appear to be the cause of ourmisery, we would be happy. Our assumption, therefore, that suffering and happiness inherein external material objects is common to all six classes of beings. Many scientists,particularly, hold such a view.Now let us consider the example of a beautiful woman. Such a woman is seen variouslyby different beings. To her father, she is a daughter. To her children, she is a mother. To herhusband, she is a wife. To a tiger, she is not so much a beautiful woman but is insteadsomething tasty to eat. To the exalted arhat, she is not a beautiful woman at all but rathersomething unclean and repulsive. If the body of a woman were a single substantial entity,there would not be such a multiplicity of concepts as to her identity. The key point here isthat the multiplicity of concepts regarding each material object indicates that objects ontheir own have no substantial or definite reality.If an object is defined by an immutable attribute, then no circumstance can change thatattribute. If an object has the attribute of immutable happiness or immutable sorrow, thenchanging conditions will not be able to affect it. Its essential identity cannot change, just asfire cannot turn into water or water into fire. Even if innumerable people try to prove thatfire is cool, it remains undeniably hot, and likewise no one in this world can prove thatwater has an inherent quality of heat. But happiness and sadness are not immutableattributes of a thing, for it is evident that, in the minds of different people, they arisevariously from a single object. The crucial point here is that all phenomena are unreal andtherefore can appear in different ways. They appear but in reality do not exist.1.4 THE UNREALITY OF MATERIAL THINGS In the Lankavatara Sutra it is said,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Outside, actually, no form is concrete—It is our mind appearing out there;Until they understand the mind,Babes conceive only the material world. Our country, our homeland, and our own houses are like containers, and our children, ourlocal and national community, all four-footed animals, birds of the air, and insects—inshort, all sentient beings inhabiting this world—are like the contents of those containers.First, to analyze the container and the contents, we will look at the spatial existence of thecontainer. To take a drinking cup as an example, if we ask where the cup exists, there is nodoubt that it sits upon the table. And then when we ask where the table is, the answer wouldbe that it rests inside the house. Then asking where the house is located, we hear that itstands in such and such place in such and such a country, and so on. Scientists believe thatthe world is round, that it was created by the “big bang,” and that it revolves around thesun, like the other planets. If we ask them what the spatial location of this world is, theirreply must be that it rests in space. And if they are asked where space rests, they answerthat it rests upon its constituent invisible particles. And where do those particles rest? Theysit upon other, smaller, invisible particles. And what is the ultimate basis of theseparticles? Even the most reputable scientists have no definitive answer to that.A solid material object must contain some indestructible substance if it is to bedescribed as truly existent. Without an essential substance, material objects cannot be said“to exist.” If a thing is substantial, it needs to have substance. Without some other thing “toexist upon,” it cannot be called an existent. It is an undeniable truth that the ultimateparticles have no substance. Whatever thousands or millions of arguments there may be toprove otherwise, the conclusion, the valid truth, must be that physical reality is withoutsubstance and is therefore what, in this analysis, we call “unreal.” But who believes thisstatement?The inimitable Gendun Chophel says in An Ornament of Nagarjuna’s Mind, The tiger’s witness is the yak; the yak’s witness is the goat; the goat’s witness is thebird; the bird’s witness is the worm: ultimately valid truth depends upon the worm. In general, whether scholar or fool, we base our reasoning upon direct personalexperience: this we consider ultimate. But how can it be trusted when, for example, manythings that we thought good during childhood become intolerable when we grow up andwhen many principles in which we now adamantly believe will later become untenable? Inthe past, great scholars unanimously believed that this world was flat like a plate; in latercenturies great scientists like Galileo believed that it was like a ball; still later scientistschanged the concept, believing that the world is shaped like an orange, with the surfacenear the two poles flattened. Scientists are still investigating the matter. There is nocertainty about its shape (maybe it is actually like the inside of a coconut), so we should not"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"be dogmatic! Each year and each season a new concept becomes fashionable. At one timescientists were sure that the atom was the bedrock of materiality, but now they know it canbe split. Until the mind’s tendency to interfere and control is exhausted, its probing of thematerial world will be endless and without any possibility of settling definitively uponeven a single concept.Only when we realize the nature of mind as taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, then, and onlythen, can we acquire final certainty. That kind of certainty is immutable even in the face ofthe loud positive or negative arguments filling the sensual, aesthetic, and formlessdimensions. If we do not possess the Buddha’s absolute certainty, then we cannot be sure ofanything and may even tend toward paranoia.How, for instance, can we trust the mind that yesterday perceived a woman as a lovingspouse but tomorrow will perceive her as the wife of an enemy who could kill our lovedones? How can we trust the mind that perceives a girl in her youth as an alluring goddess,perceives her later in life as suffering from leprosy or lost limbs, and perceives her in oldage as repulsively ugly? The mind is not a single unchanging reality. When a close friendcan turn into an enemy through some small slight, or when the man who killed my father canbecome a close friend by some positive chance gesture, the certainty of changeability isself-evident. We must look at our own experience and understand!Some people try to have it both ways: though they can accept that objects “receive” ourvarying projections, they nonetheless believe that objects must have at least some inherentself-existence. Even though they acknowledge that different people can impute differingqualities to the “same” woman, they insist that her material body actually exists. The dangerhere is the positing of two female bodies, one inherently existent and the other labeled asthis or that. Though some people distinguish between the thing in itself and how it appears(a woman, for example, may be perceived differently by different people), others hold thatthe elements themselves have both inherent existence and properties that cannot be changedby anyone: that is, the heat of fire, the liquidity of water, the solidity of earth, and thelightness and motility of air. So how can phenomena just be variable figments of mind? Thequestion is valid. Certainly, if all phenomena are projections of mind, then the fourelements cannot be exceptions to this rule.If we consider this problem, examining and investigating phenomena using the logicalreasoning of the Madhyamaka school, by demonstrating that phenomena have neither unitynor multiplicity, we can show that they have no substantial existence. For example, we all—high or low, clever or stupid—agree that what we call a “house” is a single entity. Thisunity is a nominal fact, universally accepted. The problem is that the door and the windoware also single entities, and these entities are a part of the single house. A “house” thereforeis an aggregation of many material parts. But if we admit that there exists a multiplicity,then the unitary whole, “the house,” is nullified. Similarly, if a door, for example, is takento be a single entity, no distinction is allowed between its upper and lower parts; if weposit separate upper and lower parts of the door as distinct entities, then we have lost theconcept of the door as a single entity. If we accept the human body as a single composition"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"of its upper and lower constituents, then the head and the feet become identical. This isclearly not rational. By the same token, if we investigate atoms or particles, by the logic ofone and many (or singular and plural), we will find that insofar as they can exist neither asa unity nor a multiplicity, they are mere imputations of mind and are actually empty.This emptiness is not a vacuum. It is always filled with the appearances of any kind ofthing whatsoever—houses, possessions, mountains, creatures, feelings and judgments, andso forth. All these things, so full of expectation and apprehension, are nonexistent yetapparent, and they are called “samsaric phenomena” or “mental projections.”Consider another example: human beings believe that the earth is our supporting ground,but some animals, like rock-eating frogs, regard it as food. Similarly, water is consideredby human beings to be a liquid for drinking and washing and a source of nourishment forplants; but for fish, this same water is regarded as a house or as clothes. Similarly, thediffering karmic imprints in various beings determine different responses to the samesubstance. For example, meat creates pleasure in tigers and other carnivorous animals thatregard it as food, whereas rabbits and other herbivorous animals regard it with fearfuldistaste. Likewise, people who smoke cigarettes gain pleasure from it, while the very smellof it creates headache and nausea in nonsmokers.In this way different types of beings share a common collective karmic vision while atthe same time experiencing differing personal karmic visions. Water, earth, and the othergreat elements appear similarly to all human beings as a common perception of the outerworld, while the individual’s personal vision is the product of his or her own dispositions,perspective, hearing, and experience. These latter dissimilar conditions lead us to see thevery same thing as either a source of pleasure or a source of sorrow.1.5 ALL THINGS ARE FIGMENTS OF THE MIND Appearances that in reality are not separate from our mental projections are mistaken for anobjective and independent outer part, while our experience of what seems to be anindependent inner reality is mistaken for an independent apprehending subject; yet neitherof these apparent poles goes beyond the limits of the intellectual mind.In The Wish-Fulfilling Treasury, Longchenpa says, Intoxicated by the psychedelic dhatura [thorn apple],In the vast gamut of appearances, no matter what arises for us,All is hallucination and thus nonexistent;The six classes of beings and all delusory appearances,Likewise, are pastiches of a mistaken intellect:Know every single one as an image of emptiness! Things appear in many different ways when we are under the influence of alcohol or mind-changing substances. When drunk on alcohol, a single object may replicate and many things"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"may appear as one. The ground may appear to shake, and it may seem that we are fallinginto a crevasse. Or it may feel like the house and its pillars are falling upon us. Whenpeople are completely drunk, they may sing and dance—even at their father’s funeral,making rude noises and engaging in unseemly behavior. They cannot distinguish betweengood and bad, beneficial and harmful, clean and unclean. In short, when the drug controlsthem, they act like a beast within a human body. Such intoxication produces all kinds ofsenseless, unpleasant, dangerous, and shameful behavior. This is not the fault of the person;rather it is the drug that opens the door for it.In the above verse, intoxication is a metaphor for delusion. So long as mind is deluded,the vision of the outer world and the vision of the beings that it contains are all—and only—delusion. The difference between intoxication and delusion is that the first is the insanityof a short-term drug experience, whereas the second is the insanity of our originalignorance.According to the quality of suffering stemming from the variety of feelings dominant inthe upper or lower places of rebirth, we are classified as an embodiment of one or anotherof the six classes of beings.1.6 HOW THIS BODY EMERGES FROM THE KARMICALLY CONDITIONED MIND, AND HOW WEMAY ANTICIPATE THE NEXT LIFE If we examine this body composed of the four great elements (earth, water, fire, and air),we will see that it is generated by mind. Its primary cause is the consciousness that has noorigin, and its necessary condition is our father’s semen and our mother’s blood. Accordingto each individual’s karma, consciousness enters into an appropriate womb and thatconsciousness adheres to that womb. Slowly, through ignorance, a sense of self that createsthe four aggregates of form, feeling, perception, and instincts is generated, and within nineor ten months, the sense-fields are formed. Birth is nothing other than the grossmanifestation of an innate sense of “I” and “mine.” We feel all alone, naked, and empty-handed. At that time we do not even have a name. When we feel cold, thirsty, or hungry, theonly thing we can do is cry.Then gradually we begin to recognize our mother, father, uncle, brother, sister, and otherfamily members, which starts the conception of a grouping of “us” versus “them.” Later wedevelop a gross sense of clean and unclean, good and bad, friend and foe, and we are nolonger that nameless naked one. We assume permanence to be a reality and accumulatemany material things, calling them “my” house, “my” wealth, “my” ancestor, “my” fatherand mother, “my” enemy, “my” country, “my” friend, and so forth, and desire, hatred, andignorance emerge like boiling water. A deep strong clinging to the five aggregatescompounded as an ego develops like an immovable nail. From then on, even if we havepiles of food at hand, we still feel hunger; even if we have oceans of liquids to drink, westill feel thirst; even if we possess mountains of wealth, we still want to amass more; andeven if we have the power of a king, we are not satisfied. Over time, life becomes"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"exhausted, our youth is lost, our hair grows grey, our teeth fall out, and wrinkles line ourface. Our eyesight becomes dim, and we can no longer see clearly; our ears becomeimpaired, and we cannot hear well; our nose grows unable to distinguish different odors;our tongue no longer savors taste; our sense of touch diminishes; and our body becomesweak.But in old age the mind itself does not grow old, and hatred of our enemies may increase,like a forest fire, while attachment to our children and partner billows like ocean waves.With neither mind-training nor thought of our next lives, we are trapped in a circle ofdelusion. Then one day, bearing a burden of sin, we die as we were born from our mother’swomb—alone and empty-handed. The moment of our death is unpredictable; death strikeslike lightning falling from the sky. As we die, we must leave our partner behind, though sheis as beautiful as a goddess in paradise. Likewise, we have no power to take our sons withus, though they possess the power of kings, and no power to take in hand a penny of thewealth that we have accumulated, though it be as great as Mt. Meru. Our physical bodiesleft behind, our rebirth not yet determined, we find ourselves suddenly in the intermediatestate possessing only a mental “bardo body.” In that body we will undergo immensesuffering out of fear of the bardo, and mentally we will get a rough and cold feeling. Wemove like a wave of the ocean with no time to sit for even a second, or we drift like afeather on the wind, moving here and there, obsessed by thoughts of how long this fear andsuffering will last.At the time of their death, those great leaders of the world and those scientists, who,during youth, firmly believed that there was no rebirth and shared that belief with manythousands of people, become unsure and faint voiced, and everyone can see them revertfrom depending upon the science of medicine to depending on their old religious beliefs.This shows the lack of conviction in their unbelief and, to the contrary, an acceptance of thegreater likelihood of rebirth.In Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, the great bodhisattva Shantideva said, Although we may be surrounded by friends,The sensations of deathMust be experienced alone. If we examine the sensations of suffering as we experience them, nothing is found to bereal. Certainly particles of subjective (atman) and objective aspect (atoms) with“pretensions” of being discrete entities are unreal. Insofar as we realize that what we see isactually unreal, it is reasonable for us to assume that therefore the inner experiences ofelation and pain, too, are the illusory play of the mind.With that understanding, in considering how to eradicate suffering with finality, we nowknow that mind is the sole root of both suffering and happiness. We also know that there isa distinction between mind and its essential nature. Even if we have not perfectlyunderstood it, at least we can make the assumption that everything is merely a figment of themind. We may free ourselves from gross and intolerable pain thereby. At the very least, if"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"we understand that desire, anger, pride, jealousy, and stupidity (for all our emotions aresubsumed within these five categories) are like last night’s dream, then we achieve thatfreedom. Desire is the yearning never to lose our happiness; anger rears against fear of thepain of suffering that we try to avoid; through jealousy we compete with people of the samestatus to facilitate our own happiness; we envy the good fortune of others; through pride wepresume to possess a clean, happy, eternal body, and this perception inspires us tochallenge other people’s systems of belief; and stupidity is a lack of percipience in thephysical, energetic, and mental dimensions: these five are the principal causes of sufferingfor oneself and others. If we know, however, that these emotions are naturally withoutsubstantial existence, just like last night’s dream, and that they are the illusory play of themind, then the specific attribute of suffering—that intolerable sharp pain—will not arise.In the dream state, if we dream that our beloved son has died, we grieve; but as soon aswe wake up, we know that our son’s death was just a dream image and our suffering isrelieved. Similarly, if we understand that no matter what emotion we have—whether pride,anger, desire, or anything else—it has no substantial, inherent existence, that it is just afigment of mind, and if we let it dissolve in mind, then the basis for suffering vanishes.There is no need to depend upon intoxication to eradicate suffering. Nor is there any needof guidance from another; we ourselves are the guide. When we are happy, there is atendency for pride to increase and that becomes a hook that drags us down. If at that timewe know everything as magical illusion, the pride of wealth and power will become themeans to bring greater peace, and the round of suffering will cease. In his Exhortation toRead the Seven Treasuries, Patrul Rinpoche says, With perseverance, tortured minds’ chains are broken,Happiness is mellowed, frustration assuaged;This message is the one that cannot deceive,So chant The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu as a song! In that way, all phenomena transcend their illusory dualistic nature.1.7 DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN IMPURE OUTER APPEARANCES AND THE PURE NATURE OFREALITY Whatever people assert in ordinary conversation, positive or negative, is determined by theexperience that has arisen in their own mind. If they make claims about what is neithervisible nor obvious, they are questioned because their claims seem beyond proof and thusinvalid. The mind works like speech in this respect. Because the mind accepts only what isseen clearly, what is evident, in Varanasi the Buddha Shakyamuni first taught the four nobletruths, a message suitable to the minds of ordinary people. According to the perspective ofcause and effect and what to accept and what to reject, the truth of suffering and the truth ofthe origin of suffering are the effect and the cause, respectively, of samsara, which is to be"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"abandoned; and the truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the path to cessationare the effect and the cause, respectively, of nirvana, which is to be cultivated. Onlygradually, later on, do we discover that the only effective way to proceed is byfamiliarizing ourselves with the unelaborated truth—the emptiness that is the true nature ofall experience whatsoever. Buddha Shakyamuni said unequivocally that he taught the fournoble truths for the common people. Of course, it is unthinkable that the BuddhaShakyamuni was incapable of teaching the inconceivable and inexpressible meaning ofDzogchen, but insofar as the moon’s reflection needs a pool to shine in, so the recipients ofthe profound teaching of Dzogchen need primal awareness and a very broad mind tocomprehend it. The eye cannot know a form unless it comes into the visual field. So it iswith the other four senses: people cannot know what is beyond the field of their perception.Modern youth might question that assertion. Airplanes and other wonderful things thatwere unknown to the senses in the past are now taken for granted. One can even fly to themoon. Many great things have already been invented, they may say, not to mention others—heretofore unperceived by the senses—that are in the process of being discovered.Of course, they are right, but from the omniscient scientist to the ignorant fool,everyone’s beliefs are based on their present knowledge, which is derived from the fivesenses and the mind. Whatever is newly invented is first projected in mind and then throughclose focus is developed; after this, based on various kinds of materials, it is manufactured.Whatever exists at present, whatever will exist in the future, whatever appears or willappear—it is all bound to the mind. For this reason, no one can go beyond the boundary ofhis or her mind, from famous scientist to ignoramus; in this we are just like a fly captured ina glass bottle—whether it flies up or down, it can never leave the bottle. And as long as weare bound by mental delusion, whether we are high or low, famous or anonymous, we willhave no choice but to swim in the vast ocean of samsara’s suffering. As it is said, Wealthy people complain of their suffering—Just like beggars:Every mind has a load of suffering—There is not a moment of happiness in samsara. We give ourselves suffering all the time. And if we ask, “Is there a way out of it?” theanswer comes, “Yes, there is!” The answer is the realization of the nature of mind, ofreality itself. Our eyes, at present blind to primal awareness, need to borrow from theBuddha the eyes of supreme primal awareness. If we need to venture out into the completedarkness of a moonless night when we lack night vision, either we must obtain a torch ortravel in darkness. Can we borrow the eyes of the Buddha’s primal awareness?Shakyamuni Buddha himself said in Ananda’s Sutra, I will show you the path of liberation,But you must walk down it by yourself."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"As the sutras of definitive meaning say, we must rely upon the ultimate path taught byShakyamuni Buddha as definitive meaning. Whatever form we see, whatever sound wehear, whatever aroma we smell, whatever taste we savor, whatever touch we encounter,whatever we are conscious of in the five sense fields—about these things we feel acertainty, a confidence in our knowledge. Consider the eyes, however; they cannot see morethan their own capacity allows, and if the light is too bright, no matter how beautiful theobject, we cannot look at it. If we try to look at such brightness directly, our eyes will bedamaged. Likewise, the eardrum is very small and delicate and can hear only what iswithin its range of frequencies, and if we are too close to a sound that can be heard athousand miles away, instantly we will go deaf, just as some people go deaf from the loudnoise of thunder. So is it wise to trust in such feeble faculties? All ordinary persons insistthat what exists should be proven through seeing, hearing, and mental perception. Whatevercannot be seen, heard, or perceived by mind is regarded as substantially nonexistent, asdelusion. Incredulous critics call those fortunate persons who believe in the inexpressibleand inconceivable exalted teaching superstitious fools with blind faith.For those critics I would like to relate this anecdote. One day a man happened to stumbleinto the kingdom of monkeys. The monkeys caught and examined him. “This is a monkey,”said an elder of the tribe, “but it is a monkey without a tail.” And the tribe of monkeys sataround and laughed at the man because he had no tail.Again, once during the time of Shakyamuni Buddha, the disciple Sariputra, who was themost excellent in primal awareness, and Brahmajata, from the pure-land of the BuddhaAshoka, debated the qualities of the realm of the fourth universal guide, Shakyamuni.Sariputra argued that the realm of Shakyamuni, the fourth buddha, is an impure realm strewnwith rocks and stones and covered in thorn bushes and that Shakyamuni Buddha and hisretinue had shorter bodies than buddhas residing in other realms. Bodhisattva Brahmajata,who had reached the eighth level of the bodhisattva path, rejected Sariputra’s claim aboutthe inferiority of Shakyamuni’s realm. He maintained that the realm of Shakyamuni, thefourth universal guide, has the same purity as the realm of the Buddha Vairochana(Gangchan Tso), the highest buddha-field and source of all buddha-fields. They could notagree upon this issue and decided to approach Shakyamuni Buddha himself for the answer.Buddha transformed the world and its beings into a pure realm with his miraculous powerin order to dispel the notion of inferior and superior. “My realm is always like this,” hesaid. Sariputra was amazed. Shakyamuni asked Sariputra, “Is it the fault of the sun or theinadequacy of the eye that a blind man cannot see things?” “It is the fault of the eye,”Sariputra replied. “My realm will always be like the one perceived by Brahmajata,” theBuddha told him. “The fault of not being able to see it is yours.”If the subjective “knower” is pure, then the objective field is experienced as pure. Forexample, people suffering from jaundice see a white conch as yellow. On recovery,however, they see it as white. Similarly, the clarity of one’s faculties determines the beautyand the fineness of perception. Devils in hell see ordinary water as molten iron that torturesthem. Hungry ghosts see the same water as pus and blood, filthy and loathsome. For animals"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"water is merely for drinking, and for human beings it is for drinking and washing. For thegods this same water is experienced as nectar. And to the buddhas and bodhisattvas whoreside in the pure-lands, water, as buddha consort Mamaki, appears as pure buddha-nature.It is similar with all the other elements.Are all these various perceptions valid? Everything that appears to the six kinds ofbeings does so according to their various karma and is valid for themselves. But the higherthe level of rebirth, the thinner the karmic obscuration and the greater the degree of validityof one’s perceptions. In Beacon of Certainty, Jamgon Mipham says, As more and more delusion is clarified,According to the view from below,The higher the level, the greater the validity:And that proposition we may accept. When Surchung Sherab Drakpa’s fame was universal, a contentious scholar called“Bajetong” came to him to discuss the nature of reality. He found Sherab Drakpa doingcircumambulation around a temple. Approaching, he asked permission to sit on the mat thathe laid down, saying that he had some questions to ask. Surchung Sherab Drakpa gave himpermission to question him about his doubt. The geshe picked up a stone and said, “YouNyingmapas believe this stone to be Buddhalochana. Isn’t that so?” Surchung SherabDrakpa replied, “In the ultimate vision, it is, of course, Buddhalochana.” “Then it is notactually a stone?” the geshe asserted triumphantly. “If we look at its illusory appearance, itis solid stone,” the master replied. He then asked the geshe, “Do you dare to deny ordenigrate the power of karma?” At this, the geshe lost confidence in his hypothesis. Later hebecame one of Surchung Sherab Drakpa’s eight lineage-holding disciples. It is veryimportant, therefore, to know the distinction between the apparent condition and the truecondition, between the conditioned state and the reality, between relative and ultimate, andbetween mental fabrication and the natural state of all material things.1.8 ALL PHENOMENA ARE UNREAL: ALL IS JUST A DELUSIVE DISPLAY OF MIND Some people say that an event cannot be accepted if it has not been seen with the eyes. Acouple of decades ago, the Nepalese teacher Kapil, a communist ideologue, maintainedpublicly that there was no rebirth because no one alive can personally vouch for it. If ittruly existed, he maintained, then it could be positively affirmed through the powers of thesenses: since no one has seen it, it doesn’t exist. I say that this argument—that all unsensedthings are thereby nonexistent—is not worthy of consideration. If we insist on believingonly what we see or hear, then we must give up belief that our ancestors once existed in thisworld. Even if we were to live to the age of 150—and no one does—this world is so vastthat it is highly unlikely that we would have actually met our ancestors and therefore beable to stand witness to their existence. If the absence of any living witness to our ancestors"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"proves their never having existed, then how is it possible that our father came intoexistence? Is it possible for an effect to appear without a cause? If we believe there can’tbe an effect without a cause, then Kapil himself, were he sitting right in front of me, couldnot exist because he denies the existence of his causes, that is, his ancestors whom he hasnever seen. Is it proper to deny the evidence of the senses? There is no answer. Eventhough we cannot see the cause, if there is an indication, or logical evidence, that somethingexists, then even modern scientists and intellectuals must accept it.Once, in 1998, I met a group of American tourists on their way to Mt. Kailash. Theywere skeptical about buddha-dharma, but most of them were interested in it. Among themwas John, who sat quietly, saying nothing, just sitting with his legs stretched out. I askedhim if he had any questions. He said straight away that he did not believe in buddha-dharma. I told him that he ought to believe in it because it dealt with the real nature ofthings. He said that religion maintains the truth of previous and future lives and of karmiccause and effect and that he did not believe in a future life because no one has been thereand returned to tell the tale. I told him, “Tomorrow you are going to Mt. Kailash, but whohas seen tomorrow? Just because no one in the world has seen tomorrow, not even yourfamous president Bill Clinton, does that mean that there is no tomorrow? Your onlyresponse can be that since there is a today, therefore the probability is that there will be atomorrow. Likewise, if there is a present life, isn’t it probable that there will be a futurelife?” “Your answer is interesting,” John responded and clammed up. “If there is anindication or reason for it, even though it cannot be seen or heard, we should accept it as apossibility,” I continued. “Material objects may be viewed in three ways—as form, asconsciousness, or as neither form nor consciousness—each dependent upon its own causalstream, just as a sprout of barley comes from barley seed or a sprout of rice grows from therice seed. There is no doubt that a perception arises from a previous similar moment ofconsciousness. So the previous life and the next life, karmic cause and effect, are commonsense, and their connection may be directly inferred.” Having listened to me, John seemedsatisfied. “Very interesting!” he said as he departed.If we examine the egoist consciousness of the personality in the present moment, bycareful discrimination, dividing it into thousands of parts, we find nothing. Even ifthousands of scientists subject this body of flesh and blood to dissection and microscopicanalysis, they will not find any discrete consciousness, only various substances composedof the four elements. Simply because they cannot find consciousness, however, does notprove that it is nonexistent. To insist that it is nonexistent is a denial of common sense andjust nonsense! Consistent with that, since there is a present life, so too there should be anext life. Because today exists, we can reasonably presume that there is a tomorrow.In The King of Samadhi Sutra, it is said, Eyes, ear, and nose are undependable;Tongue, body, and mind are unreliable:If these senses were valid guides,Who would follow the noble path?"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" If seeing with our eyes and hearing with our ears were in themselves enough to establishvalid cognition—if our five senses by themselves could see actual reality—then therewould be no need of the Buddha’s eye of awareness and the paths and levels. Moreover themicroscopes that can see atoms would be pointless since we would have accepted thatwhat we see with our eyes is the definitive truth. Shakyamuni Buddha said 2,500 years agothat upon an atom invisible to the eye reside thousands of beings. Scientists have validatedthis statement: there are, for example, innumerable germs in a single drop of blood of atubercular patient. So the Buddha and the scientists are in agreement, except the Buddha didnot depend upon a machine to see it but instead perceived it with his primal awareness.In this twenty-first century, in Western countries, the outer world is highly developed andstill developing, and it appears that people’s lives are problem free, but at the same time,we see that many people are depressed and crying out in their pain. Anyone who visits theWest from a less-developed country is amazed upon seeing how beautiful and welldeveloped it is, for both Asians and Westerners think that happiness depends upon materialthings and money. To attain that happiness, people strive busily without food by day andwithout sleep at night. Besides that, if we see how animals, birds, and insects search forhappiness in the material world day and night, we may assume that they, like humans, desirehappiness and loathe suffering, want love and hate aggression and pain, and believe thathappiness is derived from material things. Isn’t that amazing!Consider the example of a millionaire who has a very beautiful well-furnished housewith a charming garden in front, a swimming pool behind, soft pillows and bedding, goodInternet connection, a television for viewing the international news and entertainment, and aphone near his bed with which he can talk without disturbance to his father and motherliving in a far-away country. If he feels cold, he can warm the room with a heater; if hefeels hot, he can cool the room with an air-conditioner. He has a fine electricity service,owns many hectares of land around the house, has a vast variety of food and drink, owns avery fine automobile waiting in front of the house, and frequently engages in entertainmentwith beautiful women. Wherever he goes, he is escorted by servants.If we listen to the news or reports from people who know these rich people, however,outer appearances and inner nature do not seem consistent. These rich people are veryaggressive, it seems. Without relying on alcohol and drugs, how can they be at ease? Thefires of jealousy burn against their superiors. They strive in competition with people oftheir own class and status. They try to undermine their inferiors. Sometimes, due to theirbad habits, they engage in illegal actions and find themselves summoned to court and thenimprisoned for years, and then their grief has no end. They may need to promise not tocommit such acts again and beg forgiveness from the government.Seeing all these things, the inherent fault of attaching oneself to material happiness as if itwill last forever is clearly demonstrated. Such wealthy people should not need to do suchthings. But out of the root of ego grow the branches of pride from which hang virulentpoisonous fruit that ruins oneself and others. If happiness depended upon objective materialthings, rich people would not undergo suffering as they do, but rather they would enjoy the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"pleasure of the gods. But happiness doesn’t stay more than a moment; second by second itchanges inexorably from happiness into suffering.1.9 THE METHOD OF ELIMINATING BELIEF IN CONCRETE REALITY, THE CAUSE OF SUFFERING The root of all suffering is the grasping at and clinging to a substantial essence in objects.First, we need to learn to apprehend the unreality of material things.Happiness and suffering do not exist in the nature of things. What we consider to be asource of happiness—for example, our children, partner, wealth, and so on—sometimesbecomes a source of suffering, such as the death of our beloved son, the infidelity of ourbeautiful wife, the theft of our cherished wealth, or even the loss of our own life.Sometimes, an event that we considered a source of suffering becomes a cause of pleasure.What about the enemy who by merely uttering a few chance words turns into a close friendready to put his life at risk for us? Or take Mahatma Gandhi’s experience of painfulhumiliation on a train, from which arose the heroic thought of struggling for Indianindependence. Afterward the Mahatma pioneered the path of nonviolence, for which hewould become world famous. In that case, the negative situation turned into a highlypositive and favorable event.Again, a long time ago in India there was a great poet called “Tulsi Das.” One day hiswife left his house to visit her parents. Tulsi Das could not sleep even a night without hiswife beside him, so he went to her, a journey that involved crossing the great river betweenhis village and his in-laws’ house. When he reached the place where his wife was staying,she accosted him, saying, “You shameless sex-starved beggar! You even risk your life tocome to me.” He was so saddened by his wife’s attitude that he left her and went to Mt.Bikche, where he meditated for many years. One day he had a vision of a deity andobtained from him the power of literary composition. He composed the versifiedRamayana, beloved by all India, and his fame spread far and wide. Thus humiliation by hiswife created the condition for the composition of a literary masterpiece.During the Maoist insurgency in Nepal, the cadres burnt down the people’s huts in somesmall villages. After peace was made, the Nepali government gave large sums of money ascompensation to the owners of those huts, and with that money, they built big houses in thecity. The tragedy of their homes’ being destroyed became a source of happiness for them.In this way, one particular event can give rise to either happiness or suffering. Further,when we feel happy, wherever we look, we take delight in what we see and derive feelingsof happiness and beauty from everything. When we suffer, everything we see or hear isunpleasant. When our blood is boiling, we will reject, break, or destroy anything we see infront of us. We know that sometimes a person will burn down his or her own house in angerand even incinerate his or her own body. When we are angry, everything we perceive is asource of anger and displeasure; wherever our gaze falls, we see the root cause of oursuffering.All appearances may well be our own projections, but their particularity is not"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"predictable or invariable. How things look in childhood is quite different from how theylook in old age. Moreover, what appears undoubtedly pleasant and true in the morning maybecome quite unpleasant by evening. Each of us can recall examples from personalexperience of such change, of diverse, unpredictable, equivocal experiences arising froman undefined source. This fact helps demonstrate that all phenomena are projections of ourminds. On the other hand, if we are unable to comprehend phenomena as illusion, as mereappearance manifesting without any substantiality, we tend to believe that our enemy’senmity is immutable and that our friend’s loving regard will last forever.When famous and rich people believe their fame and wealth to be something trulyexistent, they are deluded, and the opportunity for release from samsara never arises. Sowhat is the meaning of “truly existent”? What is truly existent must be intrinsicallysubstantial, with a permanent, unchangeable, firm, stable, and indestructible essence. Ifapparent objects are not truly existent, how can they be a constant and certain source ofsuffering? How can suffering arise invariably from an object that is not inherentlysubstantially existent? Similarly, if thoughts about an event that is inherently illusory areunderstood to be untrue, then there can be no foundation for belief that causes suffering.Only if the essentially unstable event is taken to have substantial existence can thoughtsarise as beliefs that cause suffering. Consider the case of a dark-colored rope mistaken fora terror-inducing snake. Here it is the belief that a delusory creation of mind is real thatprovokes our fear. Suffering arises from delusory perception of things, from a failure to seetheir true nature.Moreover, consider the experience of a man who spends a moonless night in a placewhere there is no electricity or any other source of light. Covering his head with a blanket,he dreams that he enters a large garden filled with flowers, where a party is in full swing.He joins the crowd and converses happily with them amid all those beautiful flowers,eating tasty food and touching and smelling those beautiful flowers. At the time, heexperiences the beautiful garden, the talking, and the seeing as real. When he wakens, heknows that the dream was unreal and that the garden had no substantial existence.Suppose we assume that what we see in the light of day is true and what we see in dreamis unreal. Then consider first, where our daytime perceptions come from; second, wherethey abide; and third, where they go. This examination should result in the realization of theunreality of our ordinary experience and an increase in the sense of illusion. What weordinary people perceive as real, enlightened beings see as in a dream world. Since theyknow that every atom is substantially nonexistent, their perception of the illusory nature ofreality is constant. For this reason they can never be distracted by the apprehension thathappiness resides externally.Ordinary people hold the view that the perceiver and the objective field are truly existent—and thus they suffer. Noble beings, on the other hand, realizing that the perceiver and theobjective field are untrue and unreal, go on in every life from happiness to happiness. Thedifference between these two is the vast difference between the mundane materialistic pathand the transcendental dharma path. In Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Shantideva"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"says, An ordinary person looking at external objectsBelieves them to be genuine and true,While the yogin sees them as magical illusion:That is why yogins and laymen disagree. The many religious schools of this world, whether Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, orMuslim, the great scientists who analyze the nature of things, and the atheists too do notargue about whether things are perceived or not. If things cannot be perceived, then there isnothing to argue about; if what is seen is the same to all, then no argument arises. But theydo argue. Each school has its own opinion about the origin and nature of appearances. Theyargue whether appearances are determined by the objective or the subjective aspect andwhether the appearances we perceive in the moment coincide with the actuality. Theargument is about the cause of external appearances, about who or what produces thoseappearances. “Scientists”—rational, Western intellectuals—need to examine the differentphilosophical opinions determined by divergent views about how appearances areperceived. Everyone can accept that the nature of appearances is what is disputed and is thenecessary focus of examination. The belief that appearances are nonexistent contradictscommon sense, since if they did not exist, all putatively perceptible, material things wouldbe like space. The crucial question that scientists must address is whether the object thatappearances depend upon is truly existent or not. The answer necessarily must always be“No object upon which any appearance may depend has a true existence!” as explainedabove.1.10 THE WAYS OF ESTABLISHING THE UNREAL WORLD AS MAGICAL ILLUSION IN THEDIFFERENT LEVELS OF APPROACH Even the early Buddhist Relativist (Vaibhashika) and Traditionalist (Sautrantika) schoolsaccepted that gross phenomena like mountains, houses, and so forth, exist only asimputation. According to them, what we perceive, speak, or do—both mind and mentalfunctions—are fictional truths: whatever is established by the application of gross labels isconsidered to be fictional and illusory. But they also believe that there are basic particlesthat are not just nominal imputation but have actual substantial existence—that areultimately real. An instant of consciousness, for example, is deemed to be a discreteindivisible entity, and therefore an ultimate truth.The Mahayana Mind-Only school (Chittamatra) holds that, primordially, the appearanceof all things has been determined by the various habitual imprints upon the basic ground ofbeing of the mind’s positive and negative thoughts. Gradually, the power of habitualtendencies increases and the entire world with its various beings appears. They do notassert that collections of atoms are the basis of reality as in the Relativist and Traditionalist"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"schools. Such atoms cannot withstand analysis, as Asanga points out in The Thirty Stanzas, If its six sides are considered as separate,The basic atom would be sixfold;If the six sides are considered a unity,The universe would be one single atom. For this reason the Mind-Only school posits the existence of appearances only as mental.Perception of the subject/object dichotomy as empty is considered to be the absolute truthof intrinsic presence and light itself. If all external phenomena, established as emptiness,are insubstantial and not inherently existent, then the consciousness of the subjectiveknower, and even intrinsic presence and its radiance, remain groundless and unestablished,although real. If there is no color blue in the objective field, there can be no eye-consciousness of blueness. If we know that the empty consciousness of dualistic perceptionis actually intrinsic presence and its radiance, then the imputations of the analytic mind areseen to be without foundation.The Middle Way school (Madhyamaka) holds that the objective aspect of perceptualevents—the object itself—is unreal. But unlike the Mind-Only school, it does not acceptthat the intrinsic presence and radiance of an objectless perception is real. It maintains that“the perception of the emptiness of subject and object as intrinsic presence and light” ismerely another label pasted by the discursive mind upon a fictive experience. It maintainsthat, if one examines closely this supposed reality of intrinsic presence and light withanalytic logic, one discovers that there is not the slightest truth in it. Chandrakirti in hisEntry into the Middle Way says, Do not think that form can exist without mind;Do not think that mind can exist without form:Accept neither both nor neither, said the Buddha,And that is elaborated in the Abhidharma. All the phenomena of samsara and nirvana that arise as undeceiving appearances ofinterdependent causes and conditions are thus relatively real. In absolute reality, bothsubjective and objective aspects are inherently emptiness, which cannot be established, andwhich cannot be confirmed or elaborated as existence, nonexistence, both, or neither.From the perspective of the resultant tantra, the Middle Way school makes an invidiousdistinction between the two truths, relative and absolute, by emphasizing what is seen. Inthis perspective, the Middle Way school accepts that appearing material objects are, inabsolute terms, absolutely empty and unreal already, but it maintains that the relative truth—our ordinary delusory perception of appearances as solid material objects—is to beinvestigated, purified, and eventually abandoned. In the absolute view, all phenomena areemptiness free of conceptual elaboration and free of any agent of purification, but from therelative view, one needs to cultivate what is desirable and reject what is undesirable in"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"terms of karmic propensity. In the resultant tantra, on the contrary, there is no basis forholding an uncompromising classification of what is valid and what is not since bothrelative and absolute views are just the same nominal imputation. All views are onlynotional-conceptual because in the natural or essential state of reality neither the relativenor the absolute can ever exist.In his Great Memorandum of View, the peerless pandita Je Rongzompa says, If buddha is our essential identity,Our attributes can be no other than buddha;Since an attribute is a part of identity,The attribute and the identity are both buddha. With the realization that we and buddha are inseparable, reality abides nowhere inparticular, wanting nothing. Just so, as taught in the sutras of definitive meaning, perfectinsight and meditative absorption are the path of Shakyamuni Buddha.In neither relative nor absolute reality is anything good or bad, and there is nothing ineither to cultivate or reject. Consider dream experience: therein we can infer that eventsarise from causes and conditions, that sowing crops brings forth a harvest, that consumingpoison results in death, and that taking medicine assists recovery. But even though suchevents appear in sequence, neither the death after taking poison nor the healing after takingmedicine, for example, can be said to be connected because the taking of poison and thedeath and the taking of medicine and the healing are all dream events. Each moment ofperception of dream events is equal and the same, free of any imputation of causal linkage.Since in the waking state every event is of the same dreamlike nature, any preferentialjudgment we make regarding relative or absolute reality is a function of delusion withindelusion. As Je Rongzompa said in Applying the Mahayana Method, “As inside a dream,so outside: there is no essential distinction between a functional and a nonfunctionalillusion. All phenomena in our waking state are also without reality and without foundation,like mirage, like dream, like reflection, like apparition.” Although, in a dream, a potappears to function as a water container, it has no more functional capacity than does thereflection of a pot in a mirror. There is no need to prove that dream appearances and theirattributes are indeterminate, or have or do not have any functional capacity. Likewise, thereis no need to prove that the appearances of relative delusion—our ordinary perceptions ofinner and outer objects—arise as the products of causes and conditions, or that they arefunctional or nonfunctional: they all appear the same to both the wise man and the fool.Appearances may be imputed as pure or defiled, but there is no need to label them eitherway because, in reality, cause and effect and truth and falsehood are mere intellectualimputation. In this way relative and absolute are the same.Unlike Middle Way scholars, tantric yogins do not hold that in relative reality the twotruths are different while in absolute reality they are inseparable. Rather, for the tantricyogin, the relative is absolutely pure, and the absolute is absolute sameness—purity andsameness being identical. The unique sustaining view of the dharmakaya as unitary"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"awareness and emptiness sees the absolute inseparability of the relative and the absolute. InThe Wish-Fulfilling Treasury, Longchenpa says, The relative is beyond distinctions,Beyond the two nominal truths,And therefore any elaboration is redundant.The truth of inseparability cannot be proven or denied.In spaciousness, appearances and emptiness are nondualAnd therefore truth is one. No matter what arises in samsara and nirvana, at the very moment of its appearing, it arisesin ultimate timeless emptiness. There is not an iota of good to be cultivated or bad to berejected. This is called “great timeless inseparable truth.” Empty when appearing,appearing when empty, this magnificent timeless sameness of emptiness and appearance iscalled “the view of Dzogchen” and also “the view of the ultimate sacrifice” or “the viewfree of all propositions.” In reality, therefore, all phenomena are merely mental labels, andin reality not even the smallest thing exists to be cultivated or rejected. Yogins and yoginiswho have this view pay no attention to their own level of accomplishment regarding eitherattachment to the objective, material aspect of nominal experience or to the degree of anyemotional attachment. Such yogins and yoginis make no distinction between high and lowviews, nor do they pay heed to the speed of accomplishment on the path.Consider these examples from Applying the Mahayana Method by Rongzompa: Seeingthe reflection of a snake in water, people have varying reactions: some are afraid and runaway; some see its poison and take it as medicine; some perceive it as a reflection in thewater and relate this to others but do not touch it; some perceive it as a reflection in thewater and not only tell others about it but demonstrate its unreality by touching it. Stillothers, when encountering any manifestation of a snake, consider that seeing it as real andrunning away or perceiving it as a reflection and touching it and so on are no more than theplay of children. Making no gesture either toward acceptance or rejection, they remain atease, demonstrating by this their view that all judgments and reactions of any kind aredelusory.Consider another example: monks of the two early Buddhist schools, the Relativists andthe Traditionalists, strive to release themselves from samsara by avoiding the causes ofemotional affliction. Mahayana aspirants of both Mind-Only and Middle Way schoolssearch for the compassionate aspect of emptiness as the antidote to all emotional affliction.Exoteric tantric yogins and yoginis perceive that the causes of affliction areindemonstrable, and to face fear, they visualize buddha-deities and recite mantras. Esoterictantric yogins and yoginis, knowing the inherent insubstantiality of affliction andendeavoring to get rid of any small fear they have of it, make those emotional afflictionsinto the path and trample upon them. The anonymous Dzogchen yogins and yoginis,however, know that any emotional affliction is merely nominal delusion, without substance.Realizing the futility of showing menace and threat toward it, and playing with it like a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"triumphant crow flying in circles above a dead snake, such yogins and yoginis abide in astate of natural relaxation quite beyond any reaction of acceptance or rejection to thequalities of the objective field because they have taken hold of the unchanging citadel ofintrinsic presence.1.11 PEOPLE IGNORANT OF THE ILLUSORY NATURE OF THEIR OWN UNREAL MIND SPIN AROUNDIN CONFUSION If all phenomena are primordially and reflexively released without the necessity ofcultivating what is positive or rejecting what is negative, why do sentient beings wander insamsara? The King of Samadhi Sutra says, “The seed of enlightenment pervades allbeings.” And in the tantra The Secret Core: Illusory Display, it is said, We may search the four directions,But we will not find perfect buddha;The very mind itself is perfect buddha,So do not search for him anywhere! If the nature of mind is perfect buddha, how then can delusion arise? Discursive thought inan individual sentient being arises unbidden and, exacerbated by ego-clinging, projects theuniverse of samsara. Samsara is therefore a dreamlike self-envisionment.Here’s an old story from Japan: Many thousands of years ago, long before the mirror wasknown, there lived a farmer and his wife. Every day the farmer went to his fields to work.As time went by, his wife noticed that he had begun to spend a long time each day lookingdown at one place in the field. At the same time, she heard him repeating a single phraseover and over. Wondering what was so special about the place that constantly drew hisgaze, she quietly followed him one day to spy on him and saw with amazement that he waslooking into a piece of broken glass. She snatched it from his hand and, looking into it, shefound, staring back at her, the face of a beautiful woman. She became angry and upbraidedhim. “Now I know what you have been doing all the time in the field,” she shouted, “Youhave found another woman to admire!” “That would be quite wrong,” he responded. “I amnot interested in another woman. It is my deceased father in this glass that I have beenconcerned with.” She took the glass and looked into it again, and again saw the beautifulwoman. “Here! Who do you see in this glass?” she demanded, returning it to him. “It’s myfather,” he assured her. She chided him for his duplicity, for his refusal to admit what wasclear to her eye. While they were quarreling in this way, a yogin happened along andstopped, asking them what was the matter. The wife answered him, saying, “There isplainly a woman in this glass, and he is telling me that it’s his father. That’s the issue.” “Letme see,” said the yogin, taking the glass and looking into it. Seeing a good-looking youngyogin in it, he told them, “There is neither a woman nor an old man in it, but rather ahandsome young yogin. Don’t quarrel! Anyhow, this is something I need,” he said, and"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"respectfully touching the mirror to the crown of his head, he took it away with him.As this anecdote demonstrates, due to our failure to recognize the nature of our mentalprocesses, we exteriorize whatever is grasped at and apprehend an object “out there.” Theone who grasps that object, interiorized, is apprehended as a subject, while form, sound,smell, taste, and tactile sensations are conceived as external objects. Then a welter ofconcepts of desire, aversion, or disinterest arises toward attractive, aversive, or neutralobjects. Nonduality is thus apprehended as duality, and due to our particular karmas ofaccumulated virtue and vice, we are reborn in one of the six classes of beings, each with itsunique environment. The cause of our projection into samsara has nothing concrete about it,nothing constant or substantial; the surface of the mirror showed three versions of reality asperceived respectively by the farmer, his wife, and the yogin. The yogin reacted withattachment, the wife with aversion, and the farmer with disinterest.In short, out of confused thought, we believe that insubstantial, unfounded illusion isexistent: this is only delusion. So long as we do not understand that what appears in themirror is our own image, endless disputation arises. Until the contrivances of magicalillusion brought about by a sense of ego dissolve and so long as there is dispute about theimage in the mirror, we are stuck in samsara.The gods, demons, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, and the devils of hell, each in theirown different bodies, with their own pleasures, and in their own various environments,experience their own peculiar happiness and suffering. As vast varieties of imagesceaselessly appear before us, just as in a movie, we all cling to “I” and “mine,” to “my”possessions, “my” parents, “my” lover, “my” child, “my” country, and so forth. Because ofthis, we become bound by what certainly seems to be a separate subject and object and,stuck in this belief, we are like criminals bound in chains, never to taste release and neverto attain freedom from samsara.If we think that those chains of the dualistic perception of delusive appearances areconcrete and substantial, then, of course, again we are mistaken. There is no bondage orliberation in the moment of delusion: just like a magician’s binding an illusory elephant toan illusory pillar, no one binds and no one is bound. The emotional afflictions and thesuffering that appear like chains, when examined by reason, do not have any substantialexistence. What is the source of this appearance of bondage? The answer is that it is theadventitious thought of the egoist personality that makes the illusion. For example, let usimagine a rope in the sky in front of us into which we tie and untie knots. The rope is thenature of our own mind, buddha-nature, pure from the beginning, like the sky. The knots arethe tangles of dualistic perception, made by the negations “no” and “is not” and theaffirmations “yes” and “is,” which create the delusive appearances of samsara, like avision of a vast magical country. Until the magician interrupts the magical illusion that hecreates by mantra and props, we believe it to be real, when actually all along it has beenwithout foundation or base. Until we abandon the attachments of dualistic perception, wewill fall for the terrific illusions of samsara, thinking them to be real when in fact there isnothing substantial out there at all."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"1.12 PURE PRESENCE ITSELF IS BUDDHA The root cause of suffering in beginningless samsara is the emotional affliction of desireand aversion. Insofar as we need to rid ourselves of the delusive mental projections thatemerge from those emotions, perhaps the first thing we ought to do is make a distinctionbetween what is to be extinguished and the healing antidote. For example, there is the woodthat is to be cut, and the axe; there is the sickness to be cured, and the medicine; and thereare the delusive visions of emotivity, and the antidote that removes them. The antidote is therealization of egolessness, or primal awareness, wherein dualistic appearances do notarise. But if we believe that we need to depend upon an antidote in the sense of isolating,following, and practicing it, we are mistaken. No matter which thoughts of desire or otheremotions arise or which delusory projections appear, they are all the nature of samsara,complete and perfect in the total sameness of reality, primordially released, beyond erroror fault. Why? Because samsara’s nature is emptiness. In The King of Samadhi Sutra, it issaid, The bodhisattva undermines materialism,Because all existence is primordially empty.The wise do not contend with children,Or with extremists whose emptiness is a void. Further, in the very moment that samsara appears, it has in actuality no substantialexistence—it is immaculate natural perfection. Dream phenomena and the mind of thedreamer are one in the mind, just as dualistic appearances, if examined, are seen to be themagical illusion of relativity. In the same way, both the ego that turns the wheel and thereified objective field of samsara and nirvana are the nature of mind because the nature ofmind is appearance itself. Nagarjuna, in The Root Stanzas of the Middle Way, says, There is not even a fine distinctionBetween samsara and nirvana;There is not the slightest difference between them. With respect to samsara and nirvana, when we understand that all of the notions of antidoteand abandonment, acceptance and rejection, and affirmation and negation of nirvana andsamsara, respectively, are merely elaborated mental concepts, we realize that alldiscursive concepts are empty in themselves and are the sameness of reality itself. There isno view and meditation more profound or superior to this. In In Union with Buddha,Padmasambhava is recorded as having said, If conceptual thought is reality,The only meditation is upon the dharmadhatu."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"In a dream, the subjective aspect of dualistic perception mistakes itself for an objectivefield; in like manner, mistakenly conceiving the dualistic appearances of samsara as anexternal objective field is delusion. Actually, the nature of mind is never other than thenatural perfection that is the suchness of things. Just as the reflections of stars in the oceancan never be separated from the ocean itself, so all positive and negative thoughts cannever leave the nature of mind. When one is settled in the relaxed, unfabricated space ofmind’s nature, realization of the thought-free dharmakaya will arise by itself. In the tantraThe Supreme Source, it is said, Whatsoever appears is one in suchness,So do not try to modify it!With the king of unmodified sameness,Spontaneity arises in the thought-free dharmakaya. After first settling into the unmodified space of pure presence, we will experience thesudden arising of adventitious thought. This is what we call the creativity of pure presence.If our attachment to this creativity seems to arise in the form of causes producing effects,and we investigate, we find that there is actually no connection between what we considera preceding causal instant and a subsequent effected one. This is because the face ofawareness abides in primordially pure natural perfection, in rootless and baselessspaciousness (dharmadhatu). In the arising of the multifarious expressions of creativity,there is actually no continuity because an instant is by nature fragmented. A radio wave cancircle the globe three times in one second, serially, through successive instants of time; aninstant of creativity, on the other hand, is an instantaneous unfolding, not a process wheretime exists in or as an unbroken stream. Each fragment of time, each instant, is incapable ofactivity because it has no extension. Activity, and therefore karma, cannot occur in a singleinstant; it is possible only in a temporal continuum, which is extended across time in aseries of many moments. Conceptions of substantial existence arise through the mistakennotion that such a continuum is the case. But the past moment has ceased, a future momentcan never be found, and if we examine the present moment, we see that it has neithersubstantial existence nor duration in any of its aspects, outer, inner, or intermediate. We seethat an instant vanishes as it arises, and it is thus the nature of pure presence’s primordialtimeless awareness, which is skylike spaciousness (dharmadhatu).Looking out from the subjective pole in the unitary field of seeming subject and object,we see an apparent objective field: we mistake our own true face—primordial buddha,primordially pure reality—as projected mental appearances. The subjective aspect of theconditioned mind overwhelms the objective aspect and seems to arise as the display ofmultiform appearances, but in reality this is primal awareness enjoying its own self-manifestation. Just as the waves of the ocean, however rough, always remain a part of theocean, in actuality the continuity of thought, laced by the five poisons, is the display ofprimal awareness, primordially pure. This is the contemplation of the supremeincomparable approach. In The Supreme Source, it is said,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Without thinking, without practicing, in realityFrom thought itself, primal awareness is born. Dudjom Rinpoche has said in his Calling the Lama from Afar, Whatever arises as the dharmakaya’s creativityIs neither good nor bad:Present knowledge is direct buddha. In short, in direct, ordinary perception of the here and now, free of the adulteration ofdualistic perception, straight, just as it is, without the slightest modification, kept in itsnormal state, we settle into the natural state of being, and intrinsic awareness, timelesslypresent, reveals the true face of Samantabhadra.The victorious, perfect Buddha Bhagawan’s principal message, foremost in allapproaches to buddha, is that all phenomena are inherently insubstantial emptiness, merenominal imputation.1.13 ILLUSTRATING THE SIMILARITY OF THE WORLD AND MAGICAL ILLUSION All knowledge may be no more than a bunch of conceptual labels, and there is nothingconcrete or predictable anywhere. But what about our knowledge of the good we can do tobenefit sentient beings and the harm that we can avoid? What about knowledge of theuniversal benefits of medicine and the effects of poison? Such knowledge is garnered byindisputable common sense or inductive thinking. To take the example of plant or vegetablegrowth: depending upon seven interrelated causes (seeds, shoots, stem, leaf, sprout, flower,and fruit) and the six interconnected conditions (earth, water, fire, air, space, and time), theplant grows in congruence with its seed. That we know by direct observation. Or take theexample of the stages of life of sentient beings: they develop according to the twelve linksof interdependent origination starting with ignorance and ending in old age and death, astaught in the texts.What should we do with such conventional information? The answer is that so long aswe are saddled with the delusions of dualistic perception, like a shaman under the influenceof the psychedelic dhatura [thorn apple, jimson weed, used in Shaiva yoga and AmericanIndian shamanism], whenever appearances arise—and they arise unceasingly—we take theworld of labeled phenomena as a given. Then, depending upon those conceptualimputations and making analyses based on the notional-conceptual world, we have no otherrecourse than to accept and endure.Once there was a great king, and one day he asked a great magician for a demonstrationof magic. The magician inquired whether the king minded some embarrassment, and theking assured him that he could tolerate it. So the magician began. Just then, an attendant"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"approached with tea, and while it was being poured, the king heard a neighing, and lookingout of the window, he saw a beautiful pasture with many flowers and gently flowingstreams. In the pasture the king also saw a beautiful light blue horse running here and there.The king, seeing this beautiful horse, knew that he must ride it at any cost, and thinking thus,he ran to mount it. With the king on its back, the horse ran up and down and then, gainingspeed, it took off from the pasture and flew into the sky. On and on it flew for thousands ofmiles until it reached a barren place without grass, a seeming land of demons; there the kingdismounted. The blue horse that had brought him there then vanished, and the king becameworried. What should he do? He had no supplies with him, nothing to eat, and he had noidea at all of the way back to his kingdom. While he was musing in this way, he noticedsome smoke far down the valley and decided to go down there in the hope of findingsomething to eat and something to wear. As he came nearer, he saw that the smoke wascoming out of a ravine. Descending further, he called out and a middle-aged womanappeared, and he requested a bed for the night. She agreed to give him lodging, and hethought that perhaps he would return to his kingdom at daybreak, but of course he did notknow the way back to his far-away kingdom. So he stayed there for days, which soonbecame months, which, as time rolled by, became years. He stayed on with the woman,who in good time gave birth to nine children. The family depended on the milk from sixgoats, who became his responsibility. But these produced so little milk for so large a familythat the children were always crying from hunger. On top of this, their clothes werethreadbare. Eventually the woman grew old and lost her teeth, and her hair turned grey.Eighteen years passed in this way, and there was only suffering and misery. But suddenly,without any forewarning, like awakening from sleep, he found himself back on his throne.He immediately cursed the magician, berating him for burdening him with so much sufferingfor so long, and he wept. Then the magician comforted him. “I have shown you a magicalillusion,” he said. “You have not actually left your throne, nor have eighteen years passed.It was all illusion, and the tea that your attendant set in front of you is not yet cold. Hearingthis, and seeing the steam still rising from his tea, the king was astonished.Just as in that story, wherein the king was convinced of the reality of the illusion ofraising a family in a ravine with an old woman, regarding the children as his own children,and experiencing all kinds of happiness and sufferings, when in fact he had not moved fromhis throne, so too we see our world as a concrete material reality, when in fact it is nothingother than magical illusion. Even the experiences of seeing and hearing in a dream, whichdo not depend upon our actual sense organs, our eyes and ears and so forth, are justimprints conditioning the mind. Other than by the imposition of labels, not a scintilla exists,and that is the truth.1.14 THE CONVICTION THAT ALL IS UNREAL ACCORDS WITH THE SUTRAS We are told that the projected appearances of delusory mind are nonexistent: let us look,then, at harm from enemies and help from friends, at the offense rising from insults, at"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"rampant sexual desire, and so on. As with the dream state, look at them and search first forthe place where they come from, second, the place where they now abide, and finally, theplace where they go to. You will find no specific locations of such places.Then where do our present feelings of happiness or sadness, as well as our feelings inthe dream state, come from? The answer is that those appearances arise from karmicallyinduced tendencies of the mind. If they are examined, they are seen to have no substantialexistence; if they remain unexplored, they seem to be real, concrete, and true.This story is taken from the sutra The Pile of Jewels: Once in the kingdom of Magadha,there was a clever magician called “Bhadra,” and his fame spread far and wide. “If I couldfool the Lord Buddha with my magic, I would be the most famous magician of this world.”Thinking this, he went to see the lord with the intention to deceive him. Arriving in thedistrict where the Buddha resided at that time, Bhadra sent him and his retinue a luncheoninvitation for the next day, and the Lord Buddha accepted. The morrow arrived, and Bhadraconjured a beautiful house decorated with flower garlands, with a throne and tablesdisplaying many delicious foods. The people living nearby were amazed to see such things.Bhadra reasoned that this enterprise was a good test of the Buddha’s omniscience because,if omniscient, the Buddha would naturally avoid coming to lunch for fear of looking foolishand subjecting himself to ridicule. But at noon that day the lord with his retinue of fivehundred monks arrived for lunch. Bhadra ushered them in and begged them to sit down.Then he served them his illusory food and drink, and the Lord Buddha blessed the offeringsas if they were real and began to eat. Bhadra decided at that moment to dismantle theillusion of his magic and expose the Buddha as a fool, but however hard he tried, he couldnot dissolve the illusion. The Lord Buddha enjoyed the lunch with his retinue and, havingfinished the feast, he recited a dedication prayer: Both the giver and the recipient,As also the gift, are unknowable;Through the sameness of those three,May Bhadra attain perfection. This fine dedication prayer means that the three—giver, receiver, and gift (Bhadra, theLord Buddha, and the lunch)—should not be reified as separate entities or imaged asindividual objects. These three are the same in being unknowable, and by this recognition—that in deepest reality no one thing is necessarily more real than another—theaccumulation of virtue and primal awareness can be completed for the magician Bhadra,despite the fact that his intention was deluded and the luncheon was magically produced. Indeepest reality, there is not the slightest difference between a “magical” luncheon and a“real” one. Due to the inadequacy of the blessing power of his mantra, Bhadra was unableto dissolve the appearance of his magical illusion, while the superior power of theBuddha’s real blessing gave what would otherwise be a magical illusion the sameperceptual continuity as the conventionally real. But the specifics of the magical illusioncreated as “illusion” by Bhadra and made “real” by the Buddha are identical. The"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"appearances of the waking state do not actually differ even a whit from the appearances ofthe dream state, and if we recognize dream as dream, then release from suffering isinstantaneous.If right now we recognize our fixated attachment to friends, reputation, and possessions,our hatred for enemies, and all other emotivity as dream appearances and understand themas nonexistent, as mere notional-conceptual products of mind, then external, material thingswill not be able to disturb us. Realizing that everything is apparent yet nonexistent—justimages of emptiness—we attain the great citadel of everlasting pure pleasure.At present we may have neither heard nor understood Dzogchen, or perhaps we haveheard only its echo. Because of our lack of familiarity with Dzogchen, and because of ourcredulous minds, we run after various good objects or run away from bad objects ofperception. Consciousness is like a dog following in his master’s footsteps, and theobjective field is like the play of the objects of the five senses projected by a magician.When these two—consciousness and object—coincide, that coincidence is called“attachment of pure presence to an object.” That apparently objective aspect, flowinguninterruptedly like a deep river, although a mentally projected delusion, may neverthelessbe experienced as real for days and months, for years and lifetimes. Thus an old man, ahundred years old, might see his life from birth to dying as the daydream of a single day.We experience the objective and subjective poles that never exist separately from eachother as duality, and everything we perceive becomes in this way a meaningless distraction,a chasing after what is not there in the first place. In that way we are inveigled by stupidityinto immersing ourselves in the ongoing continuum of samsara. In The Treasury of theDharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, With the mind preoccupied by different petty concerns,A moment of inconsequential fixation becomes a habit,And a day, a month, a year—a lifetime—goes by unheeded.We deceive ourselves by construing the nondual as duality. So, first, absorb the excellent view and gradually become familiar with it. Until that isdone, no matter how much we listen to the teaching and accumulate knowledge, and nomatter how deep the teaching, there will be no benefit whatsoever. The mind training isexplained later in the section on meditation, but, in short, we must first recognize the viewitself, then gain conviction in it, and finally thereby realize our potential. Until we arestabilized in our attainment, we must meditate.Pleasure and pain are there for all, from high officials and the rich to beggars and smallchildren. No matter what the degree of suffering, everyone—intellectual, fool, even theanimals that know nothing—tries to solve problems by various methods requiringcontinuous struggle. Some are able to ameliorate their suffering a little by skillful means,while others, ignorant of technique, cannot even begin to solve their own problems.Whether it’s the frustration of getting situations and things they don’t want, or the frustrationof not getting the ones they do want—not to mention violence, sickness, starvation, and so"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"on—all beings are perpetually under the heel of suffering. The antidote to all this suffering—the single panacea or “white” medicine that cures all ills—is the understanding that nomatter what feelings of happiness and sorrow we experience, none have substantialexistence and none are anything more than mental projections and labels.Whatever experiences of suffering or happiness we encounter, we should allow thenatural ease and calm of pure presence to just suffuse and permeate them without allowingour own pure presence, in a process of reification, to arise as objects and attachments toobjects. If we gaze at these experiences directly, seeing them clearly, the entire field ofsuffering and happiness will then vanish like haze melting into the sky. When, in this way,apparent substantiality has been ultimately penetrated, not once or twice but again andagain, suffering and happiness and all the experiences of samsara and nirvana will beexperienced as the magical illusion of a skillful magician, or like a dream, an echo, and therest of the eight analogies of phantasmagorical illusion. Whosoever is without hope ofhappiness or fear of suffering, understanding that all experience is the great illusionarydisplay of mind itself, he or she will become a Dzogchen yogin or yogini. If we understandthat all appearances of our present life are naturally insubstantial, then even the happinessand sufferings of dreamtime will be recognized as dream. If dream is understood as dreamagain and again, then the bardo will be recognized as bardo. More details on this topic willfound in the following chapter.1.15 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SECRET OF MIND The mind can be considered under two aspects: relative mind and mindin-itself—what wecall “the nature of mind.” According to the glorious Rongzompa’s view in Applying theMahayana Method, the two terms are “mind” and “luminous mind,” or “enlightened mind.”“Mind,” the relative mind, is the intellect, characterized as fictive and notional-conceptual;it is that mind which divides experience into an apparent subject and apparent object.Luminous mind, on the other hand, is nondual primal awareness, primordial spontaneity, themind as it actually is. To address the question of whether the intellect and luminous mindare one or two, take the example of a firebrand and its circle of fire. When the firebrand isheld in the hand and whirled around at night, a wheel of fire appears. This wheel of fireseems to be independent of the firebrand itself because nothing can be observed in the darkother than the wheel of fire, but it actually has no independent existence at all—it is totallydependent upon the firebrand and the properties of the eye. The subjective intellect—oursense or experience of a self separate from an observed “objective” field—is like thewheel of fire: we can say upon reflection that though it appears and is experienced, it hasno substantial existence whatsoever beyond this appearance. When luminous mind self-manifests as a condition of dualistic perception, it is called “fictive mind” and is just likethe wheel of fire, arising in dependence on something else and having no true existence ofits own. Primal awareness, free of dualistic perception, is called “luminous mind” and isjust like the light of the firebrand, on the basis of which the illusion of a wheel can arise."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The basis of the illusion of the wheel of fire is nothing other than the firebrand, but thefirebrand itself does not partake of the illusion of the wheel of fire—the firebrand does not“see” the wheel and is not “deluded.” So be sure that while the intellectual mind’sdelusions are not other than the nature of mind and the creativity of pure presence, luminousmind itself should not be mistaken for the intellect—it could not be the intellect becauseluminous mind is free of adulterating dualistic perception. In The Medium MatrixPerfection of Wisdom Sutra in Eight Thousand Verses, it is said, The mind has no substantial existence—The nature of mind is clear light. Mind can be understood as manifesting under two aspects: the delusive mind that is theintellect and the real mind that is its nature. These two aspects are like the wheel of fire andthe firebrand, respectively. The fictive mind is primordially insubstantial and withoutinherent existence. It is limited by conceptual delusions of dualistic perception that appeareverywhere and move constantly, never standing still. Leading us all, selfrighteously, thisfictive mind believes itself lord of everything, and, as a result, through the concepts of “I”and “mine,” it finds samsara everywhere.Real mind, the nature of mind, mind in its natural aspect, is primordially free of thediscursive elaboration of subject and object, of grasper and the grasped. It does not consistof substance or material things. On the contrary, the essence of the nature of mind isuncompounded and immutable. The primal awareness that is the true nature of mind isprofound clarity abiding in the Vase Body of Eternal Youth, the dimension of eternal life inpure being and primal awareness.Just as a wheel of fire is nothing other than the firebrand, the fictive intellectual mind isnothing other than the real luminous mind. As Longchenpa says in The Treasury of theSupreme Approach, “The appearance of external objects arises naturally from mind’smagical display; internal appearances of mind arise naturally from the creativity of purepresence.”All external seemingly concrete phenomena arise from mind’s magical display, while theinternal appearance of mind, our seeming subjectivity, arises from pure presence’screativity. In mistaking what is nondual as two, in mistaking the field of experience asobject and subject, attachment arises, along with the rest of our emotional afflictions.To cure human illness, first we must diagnose the disease; only then can we takeappropriate medicine. In the Supreme Tantra, Lord Maitreya says, “To know the disease isto eradicate its cause.” So, first, investigate this fictive intellectual mind. Our mind in thispresent moment is seemingly seeing and knowing appearances very clearly, but the mind isnot at all what it seems to be. It cannot be found on top or under our flesh or fat, or in theblood or lymph, or in the hair or nails, and so forth. Likewise, it cannot be found in theforms of material objects, in white, yellow, red, or green colors, or in square, triangular,half-moon, or circular shapes. It is not merely that our eyes cannot see it, but its discoveryis beyond even the most advanced technology. It cannot be found inside or outside or in"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"between. Although we cannot say for certain that it existed in the past, that it exists in thepresent, or that it will exist in the future, what we are perceiving now as felt knowledge,bright and aware, is called “perception.”This perception is a projection of our mind—self-envisionment. If we know that objectsof dualistic perception are rootless and baseless, then they can be recognized withoutattachment or reification as simply raw presence, pellucid emptiness. The foregoing iscalled “the introduction to real luminous mind” or “dharmakaya awareness.” If you thinkthat this secret of mind is difficult to understand by ordinary people, of course, you areright!The principal objective of the three turnings of the wheel by our teacher ShakyamuniBuddha is stated in The Sutra of Individual Liberation, Abandon all vice,Cultivate every virtue,And tame the mind:That is buddha-dharma. Shakyamuni Buddha taught many methods of taming the delusory mind. But left to ourselves,we do not feel any compulsion to look back at and examine what we call “mind” or anydesire to discover its nature; for that reason a doubt about it never arises. What feelshappiness or sadness, guides us in life, is the source of all modern scientific knowledge,and discriminates between good and bad—in short, what sees, knows, expresses, andexperiences all knowledge—is the ordinary mind. If we turn back and look at it for amoment, examining it, we will find it to be like a motor car without brakes, running at morethan a hundred miles an hour, an accident always imminent. The mind, in its deludedattachment to the five sensory objects, is like a runaway vehicle, completely out of control.The consequence of a serious motor accident is at worst that we die or at best that we areinjured; the consequence of an accident of an uncontrolled mind fuelled by attachment,hatred, and ignorance is untold suffering in this life and the next. On the other hand, if ourmotor car is serviced by good mechanics, and if we are competent drivers, we will arriveat our destination without injury. Similarly, if our mind is serviced at the service station ofbuddha-dharma by a lama skillful in introducing the nature of mind, a lama who caneffectively repair the mind, we will live in complete happiness in both this life and thenext.To know the nature of one’s own mind—mind’s reality—is to see the face of buddhaoneself. If such realization is nothing else than the actuality of knowing the naturalperfection of seemingly concrete phenomena, then the purpose of Shakyamuni Buddha’smany hundred volumes of sutra and tantra, in their inconceivably varied and vast scope, isnothing other than the elucidation of this very essence—what else could it be? Theprincipal teaching of all the buddhas of past, present, and future concerns taming the mind.It is difficult to know the nature of mind but not impossible. Just as the butter in milk willnot precipitate out unless the milk is churned, just as the gold in its ore cannot be amassed"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"unless the ore is refined, just as we cannot access underground water unless we dig a holein the ground, and just as we cannot see the sun unless the clouds disperse, so too untilthoughts dissolve, luminous mind is trapped in the dualistically grasping intellect. When alldiscursive thought and concepts and all constructs of the dualistic mind dissolve into theirspaciousness, the real luminous mind in all its clarity shines in its own space, and there isno need to look for it anywhere else. If we churn milk, butter forms; if we refine the ore, weamass the gold; if we dig a well, we find the water; if the cloud disperses, the light of thesun shines through. Similarly, if we keep our mind in genuine ease in its natural state at anymoment of happiness or sadness, or while thinking, whether in joy, or fear, and so on, thenfrom within the intellectual mind shines a bright intensity, and right there is mind’s peacefulreality, the dharmakaya, a dimension that is free of the attributes of face, limbs, and so on.In this way, nondual intrinsic awareness is revealed as the true unitary nature of theperceived objective field and the perceiving subject, free of all reference points.All sentient beings have buddha-nature, intrinsic awareness, in their mindstream. As it issaid in The King of Samadhi Sutra, “Buddha-nature pervades all.” Just as its oil permeatesa sesame seed, so the identity or essence of all sentient beings is no other than buddha. Ifwe do not recognize this, we consider one as many and many as one; we regard suffering ashappiness and vice versa; we cling to a self though there is no self to cling to, and so forth,and by the power of mistaken identity, we are stuck perennially in samsara.1.16 THE DUALISTIC NATURE OF THE INTELLECT ILLUSTRATED IN THE QUESTION-ANSWERMETHOD OF THE SUTRAS This story is taken from the sutra The Teaching of the Noble Youth “Incredible Light.”Once in Sravasti when the Bhagawan Buddha was collecting alms, he passed an emptyhouse by a cemetery where a number of people had gathered. An extraordinarily beautifulchild had been abandoned there, and the people had gathered to stare. Bhagawan sent hisclose disciple Ananda to see what was happening, and, upon hearing Ananda’s report, hesaid that he thought the child was a highly fortunate being who had the potential tounderstand his teaching and who had previously accumulated immense merit. He went intothe house in order to lead the people on to the path of virtue and to show love for the child.When he arrived, he asked the child if he was not afraid of snakes, yaksha spirits, wolves,and other animals living in the cemetery. “Who needs to fear when all things are selfless and empty?” the child replied. “Due to your past sins you are here to suffer in this empty house,” said Bhagawan. “Do you, Bhagawan Buddha, still have a solid concept of an empty house?” asked thechild. “Haven’t we abandoned all such ideas?”"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"“I have no such idea,” replied Bhagawan. “I came here because I love you.” “There is no substantive atom existing in any entity called ‘sentient being,’” said thechild. “So what is the object of your love and where will you put it?” “Nonself and emptiness are not understood by many people,” replied Bhagawan.“With a singular intention toward them, in order to create the great love, I accumulatemerit through wise discriminating activity.” “You know your own emptiness, and you have peace of mind,” said the child, “buthave you actually abandoned misconceptions such as ‘sentient beings’ and ‘suffering’in the light of the primal awareness of emptiness?” “Realizing emptiness and the peace of nirvana, in order to mature beings and allowthem to attain the nirvana that is beyond both samsara and nirvana, the buddhas teachthem out of their great love for them.” “You, the Tathagata, have not yet rid yourself of erroneous concepts,” insisted thechild. “If the concept of ‘sentient beings’ is investigated, it is found to be inconsistentwith what is concrete. So where is the object of your love?” “When sentient beings fully apprehend the luminous mind and attain buddha, throughtheir analysis they find that sentient beings no longer exist. Even so, the Buddha, withindomitable patience and great compassion, seeks to help all those beings who withoutanalyzing or examining the nature of dualistic delusionary appearances are tortured bysuffering.” “Dualistic thought and attendant emotions have no substantial root. If both outer andinner body are investigated, no substantial cause of either can be found. Sinceafflictions cannot be discovered as anything substantial, what is the need of anantidote?” asked the child. “All the misconceptions about emotional affliction arise from the labeling mind,” saidBhagawan. “So that they may discard all the gross and subtle afflictions, the profoundand vast teaching is given to beings.” “Why do we need so many investigations? The nature of mind is clear light and thusemotional adulteration cannot arise in it,” said the child. “Although erroneous thoughtsmay give rise to reification, they can never affect the natural clear light that is thenature of unconditioned mind.” “What you say is true,” admitted Bhagawan. “The mind always stays in the clear lightof great bliss, but adventitiously, due to delusory dualistic perception, ordinary beings"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"are afflicted.” “Emotions are immaterial things,” said the child. “And they lack spatial extension.How do those emotions arise so adventitiously?” asked the child. “Please tell me!” “Let’s take the example of clouds appearing in the sky,” replied Bhagawan. “They arenot different from the nature of the sky, but suddenly they obscure the sky. Emotionsarise in the same way. The luminous nature of mind is seemingly suddenly obscured byemotion, but in reality it is never obscured.” Finally, the child said “By your grace, I have gained full self-confidence. I havespoken my mind without hesitation, and now I seek your forgiveness.” Then the Bhagawan Buddha took out his right hand from his robe, and the child tookhold of a finger of his hand and stood up. Bhagawan took him out of that empty houseand put him on the path. The people were surprised that the Bhagawan answered thequestions of a mere child who was so afflicted, and the people were amazed and paidhomage to the Buddha. “You have purified your karma,” he said to the child. “Now remember the root of yourpast virtue and let it be known to the people gathered here by a display of somemiracle.” Then the child sprang from the ground to a spot seven feet high in the sky andlight radiated from him and that light spread over Sravasti and throughout the wholeworld. That story is told in verse in the sutra. Here it is simplified in prose. Read the sutra ifyou would like to know more.As in the sutra The Teaching of the Noble Youth “Incredible Light,” The SupremeTantra of Lord Maitreya notes that the mind has the quality of clear light but is obscured byadventitious emotional afflictions. Nine similes illustrating our ignorance of the hiddenluminous mind are given there: (i) ignorance of buddha wrapped within a closed lotus; (ii)ignorance of honey within a flower; (iii) ignorance of a seed within its chaff; (iv) ignoranceof gold in a cesspit; (v) ignorance of treasure beneath the earth; (vi) ignorance of a treeinside the bark; (vii) ignorance of a jewel inside tattered clothes; (viii) ignorance of a kinginside the womb of a poor woman; (ix) ignorance of solid gold in the mud. Like that, thebuddhas guide us by metaphor. Buddha-nature is wrapped within desire, hatred, andignorance as illustrated by the nine examples above. Those who do not realize it are like anelephant keeper who keeps his elephant in a stable and then goes searching for it in thejungle—a totally futile exercise. Knowing that buddha is within but looking for him outsideis like sitting beside a lake and begging for water, or like having a feast spread in front ofone and yet dying of hunger, and so on.Believing that happiness and sadness depend on external objects, those who do not"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"understand that buddha is within are, as we say, deluded. So all human beings, great, small,and middling, always strive to attain happiness and abandon sadness only through externalobjects. We search for objects, argue about objects, wander around objects, but we do notinvestigate where happiness and sorrow come from, their cause, or who experiences them.Failing to investigate the source of happiness and sadness and searching for them instead inthe objective field is just like ignoring the root and focusing on the branch, putting a jewelaside and buying glass trinkets, refusing fine food in preference to muck, or refusingmedicine and taking poison. When we realize everything as our own envisionment, baselessand rootless, it is like the poor finding wealth, the hungry finding a feast, and the sickfinding healing medicine. When we realize that both happiness and sadness arise from themind as self-envisionment, no attachment to happiness or aversion to suffering can occur.When we understand everything as mental illusion, both happiness and sadness are like achild’s play.We elders regard a sand castle built by children as an imaginary castle and have noattachment to it, while the children consider it to be real and may become quite attached;when by chance it is destroyed, the children are saddened and cry. When we see thechildren becoming upset, we console them and urge them to stop crying, because their sandcastle was imaginary; we give them proof of that in order to relieve them of attachment toit. When the children come to understand that the castle was a fiction, they are relieved oftheir sadness. Knowing that the sand castle has no real value, we elders were neithermoved to sadness by its destruction nor moved to happiness by its beauty. What weordinary sentient beings consider to be real—the objects upon which our happiness andsadness depend—are to the noble ones like the sand castles of children. They have realizedthat unpredictable and unreliable happiness and suffering are without essence, and thusavoid attachment to them.In general, happiness and suffering arise due to attachment to objects in the sensoryfields. When we understand that objects in the sensory fields are unreal, without substantialexistence, just like the reflection of the moon in water, then external things no longer havepower to hurt the mind. In the same way, other people’s suffering has no power to affect usdeeply. We are not so affected by the suffering of someone else’s child, whereas thesuffering of our own creates deep sorrow, although in neither case is there a directconnection with our own mind. There is no cause for sadness in either case except when themind generates the illusion of a sense of self. Different feelings thus arise from the sameincident.When we understand such ideas, we can be free from both temporal suffering in this lifeand ultimate suffering in the lower realms.1.17 REASONABLE PROOF THAT BUDDHA-NATURE EXISTS IN OUR MINDSTREAM The sutras and tantras of definitive meaning (as opposed to the scriptures of provisionalmeaning) teach that the ordinary mind of all sentient beings is buddha-potential. Direct"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"perception verifies that buddha-nature saturates mind just as oil suffuses the sesame seed.Experience on the path leads to the accomplishment of the fruit of the ultimate level ofbuddha. Here, where buddha-potential is revealed, knowledge, love, and power becomefully mature. Sentient beings in the three lower realms of samsara are ignorant of the naturalperfection of things and wander as the devils of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals. The sameis true for beings of the three higher realms—gods, demigods, and human beings. Yet allpossess the potential for attaining buddha right here and now.We can see that knowledge, love, and power exist in the animal realm (I use the animalrealm as an example because the devils of hell and the hungry ghosts are invisible to us).For example, even though no one taught ants how to care for their babies, they still do itvery well. When fire or water destroys their nest, without concern for their own preciouslives, they try to save their eggs by carrying them to a safe place. Have you seen that? Thisis proof right in front of our eyes that all sentient beings have compassionate mind.In the human realm, we have knowledge to the extent that when we feel cold, we moveinto the sun; when we become hot, we look for a cool place; and when there is danger offire, water, or wild animals, we escape to a safe place. Moreover, animal researchers havefound that each animal or bird species has its own unique knowledge. Elephants can tellwhere there is underground water in the desert through the sensation in their feet. Birds cantell when it is going to rain. Creatures living underground can tell when an earthquake willoccur, and they come out from their holes and make strange noises. This proves that beingshave knowledge.Animals also have power. Each animal is capable of helping or harming its group.Creatures that are more powerful snatch food from inferiors and take it to their own place.Ants, though smaller than tiny pebbles, associate in thousands to build their huge andbeautiful nests up to two or three feet in height. This is evidence of their power.In 1979, at Nakchuka in Tibet, a nomad encampment was threatened by wolves. In ameeting to discuss the problem, the community decided to kill the wolves; accordingly, theybegan a hunt. But the pair of wolves that threatened them escaped. The hunters, enlargingthe area of their search, finally found three wolf cubs. But before they could kill the cubs,one sinful elder objected that that was not the best thing to do. “We should tie the cubs to apole,” he suggested, “and in the night light a fire around them. This will bring the motherwolf, which we will then also kill.” They did as he suggested, and at about ten o’clock,they lit a big fire and hid nearby with swords, guns, and stones. When the wolf cubs cried,the mother wolf came to help her poor babies, jumping within the circle of fire to savethem, and the hunters emerged from their hiding places shouting, shooting, and throwingstones. At first the wolf retreated, but when she heard her cubs crying, she returned to savethem, challenging guns and stones: she became trapped inside the circle of fire, and themother and cubs were then killed.This example shows that a wolf, like any animal, naturally, without need of instruction,treats its young with love, understanding what is beneficial and what is harmful. We caninfer thereby that we all possess buddha-nature of primal awareness, compassion, and"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"power. Certainly if we do not possess the seed of buddha, then it is impossible to attainbuddha. It is universally known that without the seed of barley, for example, there cannot bea barley shoot. If we do not possess the seed of buddha, no matter how we strive, all effortis useless. No matter how much we squeeze sand, there is no chance of obtaining juice. Inhis In Praise of the Dharmadhatu, the second buddha, Nagarjuna, says, If a stratum of gold exists,Gold may be discovered;If there is no buddha basis, whatever you do,Only emotivity is engendered. Furthermore, in the second turning of the wheel, in the sutrayana, as also in the final turning,the victorious, perfected Buddha Shakyamuni, in accord with the supreme view ofdefinitive meaning that was taught to show the potential of buddha-nature, says in TheMedium Matrix Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in Eight Thousand Verses, The luminous mind is not dualistic mind;Its nature is clear light. And also, Absolute buddha-nature is empty in essence, and its nature is without any substance,without any intention, and without any attribute. Luminous mind is not relative mind. And in the final turning of the wheel it is said, It is not like the emptiness of nothingness—like a vacuum—but rather it is naturalradiance; appearing by itself as knowledge, compassion, and power, it is clear light inits nature. Its clear light nature is first evoked in the final turning of the wheel. The emptiness of thesecond turning and the clear light of the final turning are completely consistent. Emptinessand clear light are inseparable, and therein arises the spontaneity of primal awareness thatis all-embracing compassion. In the presentation of the causal basis, buddha-nature isthreefold—empty in essence, clear in its nature, and compassionate in its all-pervadingemanation. If we examine buddha-nature from the absolute perspective, since it cannot beestablished as anything that is not emptiness, and it is neither impermanent nor permanent,its essence is identified as emptiness.If we apply ordinary sensory cognition and inferential cognition to discover buddha-nature, it is like congenitally blind people exploring an elephant with their hands—they cannever know the beast in its entirety. We might assume then that buddha-nature cannot beestablished by logic, but this is not so. After we establish that the unity of emptiness and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"appearances has neither existence nor nonexistence, nor both existence and nonexistence,nor neither existence nor nonexistence, so that it is without ontological status and that assuch it has no sensorially perceptible attributes, we have proven buddha-nature to beemptiness itself, an absolute. The natural radiance of the emptiness of buddha-nature isuncrystallizing clear light. Appearances and the absolute spaciousness and primalawareness of the natural perfection self-arise like the sun and its rays. This pureconventional logic of the primal awareness of appearances establishes the reality of theclear light. As the omniscient Botrul Dongak Tenpai Nyima says in his Analysis of Viewand Doctrine, Buddha-nature cannot be established by absolute proof;And ordinary sensory perception cannot prove it:It is proven by inferential logicAnd by the direct insight of the noble ones. In the tantras of the mantrayana, such as the Guhyagarbha Tantra, the path of liberation andomniscience is taught by means of the four kinds of appearances: appearances in the groundof natural perfection, impure delusory appearances, appearances while traveling the path,and ultimate appearance as the fruit.Appearances in the ground of natural perfection as immaculate, undefiled illusion showthat primal awareness abides in the mindstream of all sentient beings like oil suffusing asesame seed.Impure delusory appearances arise out of the ground of being, unrecognized as primalawareness. This absence of recognition is called “inborn or innate ignorance.” Whenconceptual thought becomes increasingly gross and rough and we misconceive our ownenvisionment, that ignorance is called “the ignorance of imputation.” Through innateignorance, the primal awareness of our self-envisioned appearances is not understood, andthus we become attached to the name and form of our personality, which is composed of thefive aggregates. Through attachment to a self, desire for beauty and hostility to uglinessarise, and thoughts of desire and hatred are generated, like the gathering of black clouds.Since we do not understand the nature of the objective field just as it is, we discriminatebetween enemies and friends, good and bad, right and wrong, and between what is to becultivated and rejected, and through such biased preferential labeling, we wandercontinuously in samsara. Grasping at objects where there is nothing, clinging to illusions,holding unity as a multiplicity, and taking variety as a singularity evince the beginning ofimpure delusory appearances, like the credits at the beginning of a movie.When appearances are taken as the path or the process, from objective form to thebuddha’s omniscience, they have no foundation or inherent existence, and our envisionmentof them as empty form is nothing but magical illusion. Envisionment is explained as eitherpure or impure according to its authentic or inauthentic nature, as either nondelusive ordelusive, as primal awareness or mind, as buddha or as sentient being. In the vision of the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"noble ones’ primal awareness, the nature of being and appearance coincide in the greatpurity of relativity and absolute sameness, which is the inseparable reality of purity andsameness and other similar formulae expressing the unity of being and appearance. Manymeans of attaining liberation and buddha are taught, but we must have certainty in the viewof the inseparable reality of purity and sameness. Here, without depending upon the relativepath of illusory training in mudra, mantra, samadhi, and so on, there is no way to attain thelevel of ultimate nirvana. This is the path of the yogin.Lord Maitreya, in The Supreme Tantra, says, Impure, impurely pure, and perfectly pureAre the three degrees of purityRelating to sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and sugatas. Impure delusory appearance refers to sentient beings’ appearances. Impurely pureappearances are of being and pure-lands, increasing in light and intensity from the firstbodhisattva level to the tenth, which is the bodhisattva’s envisionment. The perfectly pureis the buddha’s envisionment with the twenty-five resultant dharmas, the twenty-fiveaspects of buddha-potential in fruition (see section 4.1). This last is the fourth, the ultimateappearance as the fruit. Chandrakirti in his Entry into the Middle Way says, Without dependence upon the relatively realThe ultimate meaning cannot be realized;If the ultimate meaning is not understood,Nirvana cannot be achieved. Appearances manifest according to karmically conditioned propensities, like clouds ofimpure delusion; through the power of the meditation process, they dissolve into the sky.After the purification that leaves no residue, the potential of the five modes of being and thefive modes of primal awareness arise like the sun shining through a gap in the clouds. Butin actuality, the intrinsic awareness of Dzogchen is not produced or initiated by causes andconditions, for the potential of pure being and primal awareness is intrinsically present andmanifests spontaneously.All knowledge of things is unreal; appearances are like miracles of the mind, no morethan the cloud display of the rootless all-pervading sky. This is illustrated and explained bymany different metaphors. There is a Tibetan saying: “Don’t parrot arrant nonsense; repeatonly what is important.” Do not irritate intelligent people by foolishly addressing a trivialpoint over and over again. On the other hand, what is crucial and vital should be reiterated.If an attendant is to be sent away on an important mission, he must first be instructed aboutthe work a few days before he leaves, and instructed then again a few days later; finally,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"we need to give him instruction one last time while seeing him off at the airport. Until wehave a genuine realization that our envisionment of samsara and nirvana is rootless andbaseless, we need to be reminded a hundred times in various ways. And we shouldn’t feelany irritation about that! As Shabkhar Lama says in his Flight of the Garuda, Emaho! My lucky heart-sons!If the horse is not spurred, it will not gallop;If the milk is not churned, butter will not congeal.The meaning of this epic song,If unelaborated, could not be told,So listen contentedly without irritation! So just as Lama Shabkhar advises, read with equanimity!1.18 WHEN THE NATURAL PERFECTION OF MIND IS REALIZED, THERE IS NO NEED TO APPLYAN APPROPRIATE ANTIDOTE TO EACH KARMIC IMPULSE The purpose of any elucidation of the four philosophical views and the nine approaches inbuddha-dharma is to reveal and illuminate the natural perfection of mind. If we understandthe natural perfection of mind, then the keys to the philosophical views are revealed, andthe nine approaches are completed. Realize the natural perfection of mind, and all oursinful obscurations, accumulated over many eons, are purified in an instant. The karmas thatwe have accumulated in previous eons are countless: a pile of karmas higher than Mt. Meruand wider than the ocean is purified in a moment if only we realize the nature of mind.Consider how obscurations can be purified. If each particularity needs a separateantidote in order to be purified, since the karma of beginningless and endless births has nolimit, there can no possibility of exhausting it. As emotional afflictions have no substantialexistence but nonetheless appear through dualistic delusion, just like mirage and dream,with the arising of the conditions that cause them to vanish, they too disappearautomatically. So a separate antidote need not be applied to each emotion. Whatever needscorrection is released just as it is if only we can arrive at the natural place of intrinsicpresence, where past, present, and future are identical.In Applying the Mahayana Method, Rongzompa introduces this discussion: A man’sfather was killed by a tree, and thereafter the man hated all trees. Does this hatred dependupon or arise from the tree, or does it arise as an independent phenomenon or separateentity? If it is the former, then burning down trees will assuage the hatred. But we know thatsuch activity does not facilitate the desired result. If it is the latter, then the incidences ofhatred would be beyond number; even if they were counted to the limit of the eon, hatredwould not come to an end. Likewise, the process of abandoning each arising of hatredwould proceed endlessly, and we would never come to the end of abandonment.In the tantra Recitation of the Names of Manjushri, it is said,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" Instantaneous differentiation,And also instantaneous buddha! Consider a lamp that illuminates a north-facing cave that has been in darkness for athousand years. We cannot say that the darkness of eons is beyond illumination, for theinstant a lamp is brought into it, the cave is surely illuminated. Once we realize the naturalperfection of mind, then there is no doubt that all the obscurations of beginningless livesalong with accumulated karmic imprints will be removed instantaneously.The peerless Rongzompa, quoting from a Mahayana sutra in Applying the MahayanaMethod, says, “Through an understanding of the nonexistence of karma and itsnonmaturation, the obscurations of the bodhisattva’s primal awareness are removed.”Consider the case of king Indrabodhi, whose realization of pure presence and release weresimultaneous. Of course, if it is suggested that this renders meaningless whateverShakyamuni Buddha taught in the four noble truths about karma and its effect, what is to becultivated and what is to abandoned, and so on, that is not so. Renunciation, antidotes, andthe doctrine of the four noble truths regarding what to adopt and what to abandon are taughtto less intelligent individuals and to academics and intellectuals so that they may be led intothe Mahayana. Once they enter into the Mahayana and study well, they will gradually attainrealization.1.19 RECONCILIATION OF THE VIEW THAT THE WORLD IS AN EMPTY, UNREAL SUBJECTIVEDELUSION WITH THE SCIENTIFIC VIEW THAT IT IS COMPOSED OF ATOMS Those who want to enter fully into the buddha-dharma should have faith in the ineffable,unvocalized side of the Buddha’s message. Of the two types of student, the dull and thebright, the dull have faith in the inexpressible due to trust in their lama and the Buddhistscriptures. The bright explore the nature of phenomena and realize that appearances aremerely nominal concepts of the mind, like the reflection of the moon in water that appearsto be real but cannot be located in the upper, lower, or middle part of a container. Althoughthey see the same object in different ways, many people mistakenly believe that the objecthas some substantial existence. This is like a person sleeping in a very small house who,while dreaming, believes that hundreds of dream elephants are able to fit inside it.Scientists believe that all things are made of collections of atoms. Water, for example, isan aggregation of three atoms—one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. The worldand the beings residing in it are all similar aggregations. Buddha, too, accepted theappearance of things even though all phenomena are of the nature of emptiness. In TheHeart Sutra, it is said, “Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other thanform; form is not other than emptiness.” All experience arises from emptiness. Emptiness isnothing other than the nature of appearances. What appears is thus the ultimate nature ofexperience."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Buddhists assert that no matter what particle nuclear physicists might discover in thefuture, it will not possess a solid core, no matter how small, but will be empty of anysubstantial essence. It is simply impossible to find an apparent material entity that is not inactuality unreal and empty. This is established as the nature of reality. In his Beacon ofCertainty, the very wise Ju Mipham says, Inclining toward neither emptiness nor appearance,No basis whatsoever can be established;Due to the equality of that pair, in whatever appears,The objective field may be seen in many ways. Emptiness appears in many forms, but if we try to analyze those illusory forms, nothing isthere.The whole world is surely an envisionment. When we are intoxicated, we feel the housecollapsing or shaking. When we are in a happy mood, we think that the moon and the treesare singing. When we are sad, we think that the moon and the lotus flowers are crying.These situations are all subjectively envisioned and actually have no continuity orsubstantiality. The moon and the lotus lack all concepts of happiness or sorrow or beauty orugliness. Even though we investigate each and every part of them a hundred times, we willnot find beauty and happiness anywhere. They are nothing but envisionment. They do notexist in truth. Buddha shows that the three dimensions of spatial extension exist in a singlemustard seed in such a way that the mustard seed does not expand and those dimensions donot contract. This is not an illusion that is out of accord with nature as is, say, theperformance of a magician; it is the actual state of seemingly concrete objects. In TheTreasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, The creativity of luminous mind, pulsating outward and inward,Being nothing at all, yet appearing as everything whatsoever,Paints magnificent, amazing, magical emanation. We need a little confidence. If we demand visible and audible proof, then perforce weremain in samsara. In The Wish-Fulfilling Treasury, Longchenpa says, Dzogchen—Shown but not visible;Explained but not comprehended. Buddha’s ineffable meaning cannot be expressed in words, and when it is spoken, it is asif it were being heard by cattle. Even the tongue of primal awareness cannot express it. Itcannot become anyone’s object of perception. People may think, therefore, that primalawareness of intrinsic presence as such is an aberration of the mind, but of course that isnot so. The ineffable is the objective field of perception of the primal awareness of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"intrinsic presence in each and every individual being; it cannot be understood as an object“out there” or a subject “within” or as something that has color and shape—it can beperceived only by the Buddha. Based on Shakyamuni Buddha’s teaching, if by logic weestablish all things, from form to omniscience, as mere illusory mental projection or mentallabels, then there is no way whatsoever to avoid gaining confidence in the inexpressibleteaching. Even though there is no substantial existence in objects of knowledge, accordingto the manner in which the ground of being is defined by the particular inclinations of thevarious schools, there are many different varieties of appearance—samsara and nirvana,good and bad, rejection and adoption, god and demon, happiness and suffering, beautifuland ugly, inner and outer philosophical views, and so on—labeled and held by the mind.The mind’s functions assert the actual existence of mind and all those various imputations,and the mind provides thousands of reasons, with scriptural authority, to support thiscontention and prove itself right, as well as thousands of reasons, with scriptural authority,to prove others wrong. Mind is thus convinced of its own existence and proclaims it with aloud voice in every corner of the country. Now check whether the distinctions we make andthe imputations and beliefs we insist upon are mental projections or not.1.20 SICKNESS AND PHYSICAL PAIN ARE RELIEVED BY MAKING A HABIT OF RECOGNIZING PUREEMPTY PRESENCE Knowing that the world is a magical display of mind, convinced that the world is a magicaldisplay of mind, realizing experientially that the world is a magical display of mind, withno trace of disbelief remaining, trust in the ineffable arises automatically. If we have suchtrust, we are not surprised when we hear that sentient beings are the Buddha and that thereis no pain in hell and no happiness in the buddha fields.Shantideva, in Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, says, Who made the blazing grounds of hell?Whence do these fires come?All such things are createdBy the sin-ridden mind. As mentioned above, “Our ordinary perception is similar to perception when we are underthe influence of dhatura,” and, as quoted from The King of Samadhi Sutra, “Eyes, nose, andears cannot be trusted.” We grow strong in confidence through such statements. By force ofunderstanding that the six kinds of beings are figments of mind, we gain confidence in theundeniable evidence that an individual’s different actions produce variable experience ofhappiness or suffering. Without needing to examine cause and effect, we will knowindisputably that this is so.In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Creativity is projected as display into another dimension,Where it appears as the multifarious variety of the universe.Never say categorically that there is no cause and effect! When we gain full confidence in the interdependence of outer and inner causes andconditions, the knot of hope and fear regarding acceptance of nirvana and rejection ofsamsara will be untied instantaneously. At that moment we become great yogins andyoginis, perfected in the matrix of pure presence that is the sameness of samsara andnirvana. Anyone, man or woman, who hears, experiences, and realizes such a view willremain in the state of permanent supreme blissfulness or enjoy the happiness ofuncontaminated primal awareness as the most fortunate of noble beings. Though such beingsappear outwardly human, their mind is the same as Buddha. These yogins and yoginisexperience everything—both suffering and happiness—as happiness.How do ordinary beings experience suffering and happiness? When our daily work goeswell, whether business, manufacturing, education, farming, office management, politics, oranything else, we feel pleasure. When it goes badly, we feel unhappiness. Sometimesunwanted things occur, and we suffer. Like a revolving wheel, happiness and sufferingalternate continuously in ordinary people’s experience no matter whether they are leadersor common people, rich or poor. Obviously, every individual experiences both sufferingand happiness.In this world, at this very present moment, some are singing out of happiness, and someare crying out of frustration. Since both happiness and suffering are free from causality, wealways tend to feel joy in pleasure and sorrow in suffering, and if we are happy, we see allas pleasure, and if we suffer, we see all as sorrow. Ignorant of our own self-envisionment,we see pleasure as continuous, and likewise we regard suffering as true and unremittingwhenever we are stuck in it. Due to this, if we get a little happiness, arrogance increases,and if we get a little suffering, aversion increases, and so forth. Arrogance and aversion arelike the roots of a tree out of which the branches of suffering grow.This happens because we do not know that both happiness and suffering are figments ofmind. As mentioned above, yogins’ and yoginis’ own envisionment of illusion cannottorment them because they have understood that all happiness and suffering are merelymental appearances, and that, free of all marks of referential focus, the nature of mind isnonexistent and sealed by the impress of the dharmakaya. Right from the start, free ofattachment, whatever appears is released in the matrix of pure presence. Yogins andyoginis do not try to alter the complexion of present suffering, nor do they try to change itscolor. The suffering dissolves by itself in its own place and vanishes.Suppose travelers arrive on an island of gold. Even if they search for common earth andstone, they will not be able to find it. Likewise, even if the Dzogchen yogins and yoginislook for suffering, they will not find it. This does not mean that they never experience theexternal sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death, because suffering still arises, butsuch yogins and yoginis are free of the dense specific unalleviated suffering that habituallyinvades the mind."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"For example, in a book by Dr. Sadhed Kumar Pahadi on painkilling medicines, in thechapter on benefits and detriments, before listing the various painkilling medicines, heexplains how pain arises. The part of the body associated with pain sends a message to thebrain, and it is in the brain that the pain is suffered, not in the body part that sent themessage. No matter where the pain arises, the brain is where it is experienced: this isasserted by modern science. This is highly relevant to our topic. Analogously, no matterwhat the cause of joy or sorrow, it is all felt in the mind. If we can abide only in the nature—the essence—of mind, therefore, not only will internal suffering be eliminated, butexternal suffering also.These days the disease of lost memory (which may, perhaps, be identified withAlzheimer’s disease) is increasing. In the past such disease affected mostly people whowere more than sixty years of age. As the saying goes, “A person of sixty forgets even hisown name,” and it was normal for people over sixty to start losing their memory.Sometimes they would talk without meaning or react with either excessive joy or sadness tominor issues. These days not only people over sixty but forty-year-olds also suffer fromsuch memory loss. The main causes of the disease are severe pain, too much uselessthinking, and so much input that the brain cannot rest. Too much time spent on the computeris one reason that the mind fails to rest. Further, people who party a lot, attend largegatherings, or work day and night in business or politics without eating or sleeping do notrest enough. They spend too much time thinking about concerns, large and small, and theirminds cannot relax. Due to this, the blood cannot flow properly through the brain, and the“all-pervading wind” inhibits the subtle movements of mind, allowing fever and headacheto develop. Sometimes we may feel that “wind” gets into the heart and makes us uneasy.These are all symptoms of the disease of memory loss. When we leave these symptomswithout treatment for too long, we may lose our memory completely. Sometimes thesesymptoms will become more recognizable between the ages of sixty and seventy, wheneven the way to perform routine actions like eating and sleeping are forgotten and help isneeded just to survive. Experts may advise physical exercise and strict dietary discipline,but there is no special medicine for memory loss. When we type on a computer faster thanits capacity to process, it slows down and sometimes freezes, although it returns to normalif we delete some already programmed functions. If we could throw out some of theunwanted thoughts from our minds and give it a good rest, then, just like the computer, itmight slowly return to normal. The best method of resting the mind, forsaking unwantedthoughts and clearing them from the mind, is meditation. The antidote to an absent mind ismindfulness.For Dzogchen meditation, we need constant mindfulness, and there are two kinds. Thefirst is conditioned mindfulness, the second ultimate mindfulness. For beginners,conditioned mindfulness is remembering what the lama taught and then applying it; that ismeditation with a cause, which entails effort. Once that outer or preliminary meditation hasbeen accomplished, the main practice is to abide in pure presence, where effort isunnecessary and meditation is natural and automatic. This is called “mindfulness of reality”"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"and since it is effortless, we do not need to strive in any way to arrive there.The main cause of absent-mindedness is failure to rest the mind, a theory that issupported by doctors. Meditation is the method of resting the mind. In meditation, throughconditioned mindfulness, we first train to keep the mind in its own nature without grasping.If we return to that point again and again, thought—good or bad—will naturally disappear.Through this process, the mind becomes rested. If we can keep that up for a few hours, wewill be in constant mindfulness, and no matter what happiness or sadness arises, attentionwill not be distracted. Through this practice, we will become mindful of reality, and thusmore gentle, peaceful, and naturally happy.Through mindfulness of reality, we can rest the mind. The brain and the heart relaxthereby and stress-induced damage is eliminated. The mind becomes sharper, and in oldage we will not encounter the problem of absent-mindedness. We can see this in Dzogchenyogins and yoginis who are ninety years or more in age and who still have sharp memories.When they teach, they can quote many texts that they had learned by heart. Moreover, theycan challenge others on the topic of the nature of mind. This is not merely a contemporaryphenomenon; it has been happening for thousands of years.In 2001, I heard on the radio that in Malaysia many religious leaders and importantscientists had gathered to discuss whether religion could help sick people. They hadexamined the condition of both religious and nonreligious persons suffering fromHIV/AIDS and TB, and they had found that viral diseases spread slower among religiouspeople than nonreligious. The nonreligious were found to be more anxious, and amongthem, viral contagion was greater. It was established by the religious leaders and greatscientists at that conference that the degree of suffering varies inversely with theindividual’s degree of religious commitment.Consider the relationship between mind and body. When we have peace of mind, we feelhealthy. When we are anxious, we feel unhappy. We can actually observe this. But whenwe have tamed our minds and see all phenomena as self-envisioned baseless delusion, wewill feel neither happiness nor sorrow. Just like the king seated majestically upon his ownthrone, beyond any need of chasing after desirable material things, we sit upon our ownimperial seat of intrinsic awareness, enjoying the nature of intrinsic presence.In the autobiography of the rigzin Jigme Lingpa, it is related that once when PemoDharma was practicing Vajrakilaya, accumulating a hundred million recitations in silentretreat, he became sick and suffered acutely from his illness. Jigme Lingpa visited him andgave him the oral instruction called “Making Sickness Itself the Path with AutomaticRelease into the Trikaya”: Don’t reify the sickness; look into the one who suffers.Don’t fix your neurotic mind on the symptoms;Focus instead on the naked pure presence of the illness:That is oral instruction on illness as dharmakaya. When we are diseased or wounded, we should not conceive of the illness as a real"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"substantial entity. Rather, look at the one who thinks “I am sick,” or take on the pain itselfdirectly and gaze into that. The illness is just an envisionment that actually has nosubstantial existence. So do not fixate upon the misconception of the grasping mind thatthinks “I am tortured by this disease.” Loosely fix the naked, unmodified, here-and-nowpure presence on the baseless envisionment of the sickness. Thereby that very illness willappear as the intrinsic creativity of the dharmakaya. This is the supreme oral instruction ofDzogchen. Pemo Dharma relied upon this Dzogchen instruction and, recovering from theillness, heightened his accomplishment.1.21 MIND IS THE ROOT OF ALL EXPERIENCE We may comprehend the absence of any substantial nature in both outer and inner forms, insound, taste, or touch, and so forth, through intellectual investigation. We may then abandonobjects of desire, such as a man’s or woman’s body, by seeing that body as unclean andugly. But if the inner mental attachment is not released, the grasping that is at the root ofattachment will not be eliminated.Consider, for example, a dog hit by a stone. Instead of locating and chasing the stone-thrower, the dog will bite the stone. In the same way, no benefit will accrue by attacking theimmediate form to which we are attached. When a stone is thrown at a lion, the lion willattack the person who threw it, not the stone. The root of all desire, aversion, and stupidityis the mind alone. If we keep the mind itself in a state of nongrasping, the emotions such asdesire, aversion, and so on, will automatically be pacified. In The Words of My PerfectTeacher, Patrul Rinpoche quotes Tilopa saying to Naropa, Not the appearance—it is attachment that binds.Cut through the attachment, Naropa!1.22 KNOWING THE WHOLE WORLD AS FIGMENTS OF MIND, UNDISTURBED AT THE TIME OFDEATH, WE ARE RELEASED IN THE BARDO We may not have full realization of the magical, illusory nature of the world as figments ofmind, but with just a modicum of understanding of it, we will be free of fear at the momentof death.In August 1985, I went on a pilgrimage to Mt. Kailash. There I met a woman fromKhyungpo Tongchen who was so weak that we felt that she was on the verge of death. I willtell you her story. She was from a midstatus family in her village. She had three daughters,but because she had no sons, she had gone to Mt. Kailash for pilgrimage. It is a Tibetantradition that women without male children should go to Mt. Kailash so that their womb-blood could give birth to sons. She had gone there together with some people from her"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"village, vowing to perform a hundred circumambulations around Mt. Kailash to obtain theboon of a son. She stayed behind at Kailash to fulfill her commitment after her party left forhome. Later she gave birth to a healthy son, but after three or four months she contractedserious dysentery. Day by day she became thinner and thinner, so that within six weeks shewas like a skeleton. She could not even get out of bed to go to the lavatory. When she wasdoing her prostrations around Kailash, however, she had met a nun who took on the task ofcaring for her and her baby. The gossipy people who knew her said that, because of thestrong attachment she had to her baby, if she died, she would surely be reborn as an evilspirit.Then one day the nun came to me crying and told me the story. She told me that thewoman was sure to die, that she had given up hope, that she was constantly asking the nunto bring the baby to her just to touch his face, and that she was weeping and moaning thatshe did not want to die. “This woman is on a wrong path because of her strong attachmentto her son,” the nun complained. “I tell her that I will take care of her son, but she seems tohave no trust in me. She becomes unconscious several times a day, and then all of a suddenshe regains consciousness with wide open eyes.” She asked me to visit the dying woman.Touched by this story, I went to see her and found her in a pitiful state, her complexionpale, her eyes sunken, her nose just skin and bone, and her mouth wizened. Her thin skinhung loosely on her body, she had lost her hair, and an unpleasant smell of sickness movedin the air. She could speak only a few words. I taught her some buddha-dharma, but she wasjust looking at her baby and moaning, “I cannot die!” I told her that attachment to her sonbrought no benefit to anybody and that moreover her attachment was a hindrance on thebuddha-dharma path. I reminded her that the nun had promised that she would take goodcare of her son and that she should trust her, and I gave her this sermon. Death is for all, from celebrities to beggars. Sooner or later we all have to die, likesheep slaughtered by the butcher. At the time of death, even great leaders with aretinue of a thousand people have no power to take even a single person with them. Ifwe have a pile of wealth as large as a mountain, we cannot take even so little a thingas a needle with us. We leave behind our children and our beloved spouse at the timeof death. Death occurs to everyone, including you. So you need not worry too muchabout it.Buddha taught that all things are without substantial existence, like a dream. This istrue regardless of the realm into which we are born, and we must sustain that feelingof illusion and trust in it. In this illusion, we differentiate friend and foe anddistinguish between what is to be rejected and what is to be adopted. But all existenceis actually empty, just like last night’s dream. Whatever presumptions we make in thedream, all vanish in the morning. The same is true in the six bardos—nothing is real,everything is just a figment of mind. In the bardo there is no need to be afraid of anypeaceful or wrathful appearances. Understand that they are all momentary subjectiveenvisionment, and then you can certainly pass through the bardo without fear. Trustme! Just now you dream of being human, and within a few seconds, you will dream of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"the bardo. At that time pray deeply to the lama in whom you have faith! Be sure thateverything is like magical illusion or dream. Merge your mind with the lama and resteasily in that space and you will be released. Then I put some blessing-pills in her mouth and asked her if she had heard my words.She nodded and tried to place her palms together and then stretched her left hand towardme. Then I left her. But within fifteen minutes or so the nun caught up with me and, aftertelling me that the woman had just died, requested that I perform the ritual of consciousnesssublimation. So together with Tashi, a monk from Tamkye, I returned to do the phowaritual.The woman was lying there in the same position as before, as if asleep but with her faceaglow. She had died peacefully and many saw it. The nun thanked me and prostrated beforeme. I performed the consciousness sublimation ritual according to the tradition of DudjomRinpoche’s Wrathful Dakini of the New Revelation. The nun had no one to carry the corpsefor sky-burial, so I asked a man to loan her his yak for the task, and I sent Tashi and LamaSonam Tashi, a disciple of my late serene father, to help the nun in the sky-burial.According to Tashi’s statement, blood was oozing from the fontanel spot on the top of herhead. I asked Lama Sonam Tashi to confirm it, and he told me that it was possible thatblood from her nose had been smeared over her head. According to phowa texts, bloodoozing from the head or the nose is the sign of success of consciousness sublimation. I havelittle experience of applications of the consciousness sublimation ritual; nonetheless, theclear signs displayed in this illusory scenario of the dead woman are undeniable. I neverheard any rumors of the woman’s having become an evil spirit or that there was any fearhanging over that place, but to the contrary there was peace, and many people grew strongin their faith in buddha-dharma.If we are sure that the appearances of this life—relatives and friends, parents andchildren—are not other than figments of mind, then in the bardo and hell realms, if wecould understand all appearances as mental projections, we could be sure of release fromsamsara. If, on the other hand, we yield to even our slightest tendencies to grasp at theappearances arising in this present lifetime, then we will not be able to attain liberation inthe bardo or from the lower realms. If happiness and sadness arise and are mistaken forreal and true things in this present envisionment of insubstantial appearances, then bardoappearances and bardo circumstances will seem to be real and substantial too. Through thatbelief, karma and karmic maturation will evolve, and suffering will ensue.1.23 THE CREATIVE AND FULFILLMENT PHASES ARE COMPLETE AND PERFECT IN THE SPACE OFBASIC EMPTY PRESENCE On the various paths of the Mahayana and Theravada schools, different methods have beendeveloped to train us in the understanding that phenomena are unreal and to make availableto us experiential realization of this fact. In tantrayana, our impure bodies in themselves are"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"visualized as pure divine bodies; stabilizing this through familiarization over a long periodwith a buddha-deity’s color, attributes, face, arms, and so forth, is the main practice. Overtime, our attachment to the present body gradually diminishes, pure divine appearanceincreases naturally, and eventually attachment to our physical body vanishes. Further, dueto our recitation of the divine secret mantra, when slander, flattery, or abuse come our way,we hear such sounds merely as echo, and we suffer neither increase of conceit nor loss ofself-esteem. Whatever happiness or sadness we experience appears as the display of thereal nature of thought, and mind cannot waver from that. Whatever concepts arise we see aschildren’s play, and, free of intellectual imperatives, we are released from the round oftemporal happiness and suffering and become buddha. Because our minds are buddha innature, we can see our own bodies as divine bodies. In The Secret Core, it is said, Emaho! The elements of the body-mind,To be known as the five perfect buddhas . . . If we cultivate the recognition of our own body as divine, and stabilize this, then it is quitepossible that we will truly realize the five buddhas.In Aspiration on the Gradual Path of the Wrathful Dakini, Dudjom Rinpoche says, The creative phase, primordially perfected in the ground of being,And the fulfillment phase of the spontaneous clear light seed:These two in supreme secret union—May this crux of the vajra point take us to the matrix of the sky. Once, in the kingdom of Varanasi, an old woman engaging only in shamata meditationvisualized a tiger, and it actually manifested in the flesh and terrorized the city, which thenbecame deserted. Further, once when Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje was giving theempowerment of the Great Compassionate One at Menyag Lhagang, all the people presentsaw him on his seat as the real Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara rather than as the lamahimself. That occurred because the lama visualized himself in the empty pure presence formof the deity and momentarily created an envisionment of total sameness, thus blessing hisfortunate, devoted disciples. The key point here is that such transformations can beachieved only if the world is insubstantial and equivocal, just an illusory display of themind. By such reasoning, we arrive at the insight that the root of all phenomena isinsubstantial and nonexistent and that ordinary people suffer constantly from perceivingthings as substantial and real.The more wealth and fame we have, the more we are attached to them. They maytemporarily give us happiness, but attachment to those things that give us pleasure willsurely induce the suffering that arises from the fear of losing them. Further, if we use andenjoy our pleasure-providing possessions over a long period, eventually we will becomebored and irritated with them, and they will become a source of anxiety. This sufferingcomes from our proclivity to cling to something that we believe to be substantial and true."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"But no matter what satisfaction occurs, great or small, everything changes in a moment.Consider poison concealed in delicious food: even though the food smells and tastesdelicious, once it enters the throat, it brings only severe pain.Nothing has essence, not even an essence as small as a sesame seed. Hearing good news,enjoying wealth and possessions, associating with friends—when we can experience suchpleasures without attachment, with benign disinterest, only then can we fully enjoy them.When we are detached from pleasure—knowing the true nature of happiness and wise inthe experience of happiness through true enjoyment—we will suffer less. To experiencehappiness yet remain detached from it, like a duck floating on a pond, in this way avoidingits otherwise inevitable transformation into suffering, is called “wise in the experience ofpleasure.”Simplistically speaking, what we call happiness and suffering are attributes of nirvanaand samsara, respectively. What we call “samsara” is suffering. Whoever, high or low,falls into samsara is bound by suffering just as if he or she had fallen into a pit of fire. Whatwe call “nirvana” is happiness. If we search there for suffering, we will not find it. Just asa chunk of molasses is sweet on every side, no matter from which side we approachnirvana, there is the sweet taste of happiness.In The Supreme Tantra, Lord Maitreya, the buddha-regent, says, Know the disease, then eradicate its cause;To obtain the cure, depend upon the medicine.Know suffering, abandon its cause;Attain cessation by relying upon the path. If samsara is suffering and nirvana is happiness, unless we know the actuality of bothsamsara and nirvana, we will neither be able to free ourselves from suffering nor attain anyreal happiness.1.24 WHY ALL BEINGS ARE CONTINUOUSLY BOUND IN SAMSARA First, we should know the characteristics of this samsara that has suffering as its nature.This so-called samsara is a delusion. How is it delusory? Due to dualistic perception, wesee one as two, we see unity as multiplicity, we see unclean as clean, we see suffering ashappiness, we see nonself as a self, and we see impermanence as permanence, and so on.Through such misconceptions that deny the natural perfection of the sensory fields,attachment is generated, and we are fully deluded. The dualistic egoist mind, claimingsuperiority, arrogates to itself the lordship of reason and righteousness while pretending toknow how things should be done. Taking the lead, in fact it knows nothing.Like the eyes that see external things but cannot see themselves, we cannot see ourselves.At first, this body was created from the juice of our parent’s sperm and blood and the elixirof the four elements, so right from the start, it is a multiplicity. But we see this aggregation"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"as a singular entity and call it “I”; perceiving it as real and true, we label those whoproduced us “parents,” and our mother’s and father’s brothers and sisters we label “uncle”and “auntie.” As an extension of this process, those who help us are considered “friends”and those who seek to harm us are regarded as “enemies.” To the former, we attach “love”and to the latter “hatred,” and these imputations are considered to be indisputably valid.Not only that, but even the different delusory beings of the six realms are considered realand true, and our concepts of beings as truly existent become as solid and inflexible as ironpillars. In this way, trying to subdue enemies and assist friends, our short life ends like alamp’s being switched off. Then the delusory dualistic mind provides a primary cause, ourspecific karmic propensities gathered in previous lives provide the conditions, and we areborn into suffering in one of the six realms.If we analyze what we call “I,” we see that it does not exist as a discrete entity. Itdepends upon our parents’ sperm and blood, the four elements, and atoms. This aggregationof many components is called “I.” It does not exist concretely, yet knowing it to bedelusion, we still hold to it and say “I” and “mine.” A multistory structure built on a frozenlake in the winter will collapse when the ice melts under the spring sunshine; in the sameway, if we depend upon the “I” as a foundation, when we explore it and find that it has notrue existence, it will collapse. Then, since the “I” does not exist, so parents, relatives, andspouse also do not exist, and the entire structure comes tumbling down. Our enemies andfriends likewise do not exist. A patient suffering from jaundice sees a white conch asyellow in color; so too we perceive illusory mental projections as real and nonexistentobjects as existing. If we cover a wall with realistic drawings, which look three-dimensional, of animals sporting in a landscape, the depth is mere illusion; there is noactual foreground and background, no inside and outside on the wall. When we look at thepicture and say the deer are standing on the mountain slope, it is mere verbal convention;even so, we perceive the picture as three-dimensional. In the same way, the mind takesspecific characteristics of the objective field as real even though no substantial existent canbe found anywhere. Suffering arises from our fixation upon “I” and “mine” as definitelyreal.If the tree’s root is not cut, no matter how much we cut its leaves and branches, it willcontinue to grow. Likewise, unless the root of the ego is severed, we will be unable to freeourselves from suffering. Egoist concepts arise from the mind; if we investigate thephenomena that arise in the mind, we find that the mind is like a supreme judge whodecides everything but does not have a true frame of reference. It has not so much as amoment of peace because it is constantly running after the good and avoiding the bad. Whensuddenly it hears a sound, it runs after it to find out what might be there. Is it the sound of aperson or a natural sound? Is it good or bad? Is it useful or not? If it is considered useful,we seek its source, listen to it, figure out how long it will last, where it exists, and try toanalyze it in terms of past, present, and future. If the sound we hear turns out to be from aperson of the opposite sex, we might consider it good and that person attractive; then wemight evaluate that person’s height, sexuality, complexion, moral standards, financial"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"condition, and so on. While listening to that voice we may deduce the identity of his or herparents, close relatives, class status, friends, enemies, and so on. Then, bored with thistrain of thought, we may move on and think of our current concerns: our business, our land,and so on. This linear conceptual thought is called a “chain of mental delusion.” From theperception of an initial concrete sound, after a long series of connected discursiveconcepts, the mind finally moves on to another unrelated place. Isn’t that so?We are constantly deluded, and, in each of us, mental concepts are arising continuously.Sometimes we look inside and just assume that our conceptualizations are right. If wewonder about some thoughts and are able to thoroughly examine them, then it is possible wemay understand that they are mental delusion. Just as in a conversation, we might begin bytalking about a business issue and at the end find ourselves talking about some other issue,like war. Isn’t that right? Associations arise from one to another in a stream of thoughtdominated by desire or some other emotional affliction. Insofar as such thought streams arerepeated, this linear pattern becomes a circular one and is known as “cyclic existence” or“samsara.” The first emotive thought in the series is the cause and each successivemomentary thought creates a condition; the cause connected with its conditions developsinto a delusion, and that is the beginning of endless wandering in samsara.In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, With the mind preoccupied by different petty concerns,A moment of inconsequential fixation becomes a habit,And a day, a month, a year—a lifetime—goes by unheeded.We deceive ourselves by construing the nondual as duality. It is a characteristic habit of our mind to criticize and correct others and to blame them forour own sins. But when we need to attain some objective, we first devise a plan and thenimplement it. Take a thief, for example, who knows that stealing others’ possessions is bothillegal and immoral, and who becomes active at nighttime when everyone is asleep. Heknows the difficulties for thieves these days, with dogs in the compound and security guardsand alarms inside the house, and he knows full well the heavy penalties that will fall uponhim if he is caught. But he is undeterred by such considerations and forges ahead—whatever the mind instructs, the body performs without argument. When the thief issuccessful, his mind takes the glory, inflating with self-congratulatory pride. If he is caughtredhanded, then his mind scolds his body, complaining that it did this and that wrongly, andit was because of a physical fault that the body was tortured by the police.Once a man called “Thangpa,” while drunk, decided to thrash his old dad. The next day,during his hangover, he was so ashamed that he cut off the fingers of his own hand. Themind made the mistake, but the hand received the punishment.Theft and violence are initiated by mind. The body and speech are physical things andpossess no will of their own. Possession of wealth, for example, does not make the bodyhappy. It may be argued that the body and speech also love money, as evinced by richpeople dancing and singing. But it is the mind that commands the body to dance and the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"voice to sing. The body itself is not affected by wealth. Body and speech are patheticslaves of mind.When someone performs a service for us, we are obliged to thank the giver and offer himor her a gift. But the mind does not thank the body for any service performed, and if themind makes an error, it punishes body and speech. These days there is much talk abouthuman rights—actually it is the mind that abuses our rights!!1.25 DELUSION DISSOLVES WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ESSENCE OF MIND Now what if we simply depend upon Dzogchen alone? Do not pay any attention to thoughtsor to whatever arises in the mind, but instead examine where the thought or the imagecomes from, where it abides, and where it goes. If we do this for long enough, we willdiscover that all thought forms are empty and that there is nothing substantial in the mind.Keep the mind in its own place, unmodified and without distraction, at ease in its state ofclear naked emptiness. Do not attempt to stop the mind and do not follow it. In this way, weare freed of all the suffering of emotional affliction, and we go in peace. The happinessengendered is a deep calm, and we call it “serenity.” This is not the same as a pleasurablefeeling that accompanies a materialist’s mental event, which, through a slight change ofconditions, may become sadness. This happiness is derived from a connection to the spaceof great bliss that is thought-free primal awareness. “Great bliss” is the primal awarenessof the nonduality of bliss and emptiness, and just as a weapon cannot damage the sky, so toothat bliss cannot be affected negatively by circumstance, whereas pleasurable feelings ofhappiness that are based on mental events will, through changing circumstances, alwaysturn into suffering.Here is a real-life story that I want to relate to you. In a village in Bihar, India, there wasboy called “Prakash” and a girl called “Babita.” These two went to school together andthen to college, and they were in love. After graduation they were happily married. Theylived in felicity, never even using bad words to one another. Their love drew them closer,and they vowed to remain together even in death. In due course, they had a daughter. Oneday Prakash’s friend Rabin, handsome and smart, came to visit them, and Babita welcomedhim and gave him good hospitality; thereafter he came to visit frequently. One day whenPrakash returned from work, he found cigarette ends in the house, and, asking her wherethey came from, he was told of Rabin’s visits.When their daughter was about three years old, Prakash’s suspicions about his wifedeepened, and he decided to test her. He told her that he was leaving for Delhi on somebusiness and would not be back for ten days. Babita thought that this was a goodopportunity to go to Rabin’s house and ask him to paint their marriage photo—Rabin was apainter by profession. So she went to Rabin’s and asked him to make the painting; shereturned each day to see how the work was progressing, hoping to surprise Prakash uponhis return. On the third day, upon returning home, she was surprised to see her husbandthere. “You told me you would be away for ten days,” she said, “and only three days have"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"passed. Plus, you didn’t call me, and I was worried.” Prakash was furious, his worst fearsconfirmed. “If you have Rabin, there is no need of me,” he told her. “You are a shamelesswhore!” Babita protested her innocence and told him that she had done nothing to offendhim. He told her that he knew that she had been visiting Rabin every day and that he did notneed her any more. She swore that she had done nothing wrong with Rabin. She begged himto back off. They had a fight, and he beat her and kicked her out of the house. She lost hopeand made a final request for her daughter. He told her that a whore does not have any rightsand refused her. Babita left home weeping.Believing that Babita had deceived him, Prakash was very depressed. His daughter criedconstantly for her mother and would not sleep. He started drinking and became a little mad.After a few days, someone knocked on his door, and when Prakash opened it, there stoodRabin. Rabin asked Prakash in a friendly manner when he had returned from Delhi, butPrakash was angry and immediately was sharp tongued with Rabin, asking abruptly what hehad come for and what he wanted. Rabin replied in amazement, “What is the matter,Prakash?” “You have ruined my life, and I am not going to let you live,” Prakash shouted,trying to take him by the throat. While they were fighting, the painting that Rabin had cometo deliver to Babita dropped from under his arm and, seeing that Rabin had brought hiswedding picture, Prakash stopped short. Then Rabin told him about Babita’s intention, butPrakash was not convinced. “You are my best friend, Prakash, and I don’t want to ruin yourlife. If you don’t believe me, then kill me—here’s a knife.” Prakash took the proffered knifebut could not plunge it into his friend’s breast. Instead, now convinced of his wife’sinnocence and realizing his own foolish jealous delusion, he turned the knife on himself,thrust it into his heart, and died.Through his jealous attachment and deep delusion, Prakash ruined three lives: his own,his wife’s, and his daughter’s. Jealousy, desire, and delusion are all mental factors, andignorance of this leads to our punishing the body. In this way, second by second, the mind ismaking errors that result in physical pain for oneself and others. It is vital to examine whereerror lies and decide what to do about it: to eradicate it or ignore it. When storm waves ofthought overwhelm us and we do whatever comes into our mind without any consideration,we end up with so much regret. As the saying goes, “Be slow in the busy moment!” Themore we find ourselves possessed of urgency or apprehension, the greater is our need for amoment of recollection and consideration. Only after this should we get to work.Regarding the story of Prakash and Babita, in the first place, it would have been best toavoid unworthy suspicion of the loving wife. But when suspicion arose, it should have beenexamined carefully. Later on, when that suspicion was discovered to have been ill founded,forgiveness should have been sought from the wife: it is quite possible that she would haveoffered it. Without such consideration, just following a mind stuck on a single track maylead to destruction of a happy family and end in suicide. There is nothing more perniciousin the world than that sort of bad thinking.Further, these days some imagine that suicide is the best way to end suffering, and theyactually propagate such notions on websites, in books, and so on. These are works of fools"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"and not at all correct. As it has been said, Those who find no meaning in life,Thwarted, seek happiness in death. Suicide, however, will not end suffering. At the time of death, first there is heavy sufferingin the gradual dissolution of the four elements. Happiness and suffering and even temporalduration are just subjective illusions. Happiness can seem eternal; but even the five-hundred-year life span of a god expires in a moment. Likewise a moment of suffering mayseem like an eon. When our lives are full of anxiety and we cannot sleep at night, a day mayseem like a month. Look at the pain that we endure when we simply try to stop our breathfor one minute; each second seems an eternity. At the time of death, considering only thesuffering caused by the cessation of the outer breath, our suffering is immense. Then,immediately after the moment of death, when outer appearances have ceased and the soundof the bardo hits us like thunder, we are terror struck. When rays of heat and light vastlymore powerful than the rays of our sun strike our body, we are terrified. With knowledge ofthe body’s insubstantiality and transparency, we are paralyzed with fear. Although all thisfear is mental delusion, the suffering is seven times greater than mundane suffering.Consciousness is now moving like a feather on the wind, without any control at all. Besetby the illusions of the after-death bardo, we must go alone and friendless through thenarrow defile of rebirth. To find more about the bardos, read Liberation by Hearing in theBardo (The Tibetan Book of the Dead).If, mentally, we look into the bardo, we find that some dead people become evil spirits.There are many stories about them, of course, but such spirits can actually be seen with theeyes. Rationalists may not believe in the existence of beings like this, but they cannot provethey do not exist. On December 20th, 2003, on the BBC Hindi program, it was reportedthat, in an old castle that had been turned into an exhibition hall, a video had been shot of astrange old man wearing clothes dating from a thousand years ago. Moreover strangevoices had been heard several times in that castle. Such stories may provide informationfrom which we may deduce that there are beings in the bardo. Moreover, a being of thattype may actually enter the mind of a person still living and cause the person possessed torecognize relatives, a house, locations, and so forth, that the living person had no previousknowledge of. Certain occurrences can be cataloged. Just recently at Limi Til in Humla,Nepal, a woman’s spirit possessed a man, and this was witnessed by many people.Anyway, the point is that suicide does not end suffering. After death we must enter thebardo of becoming, the bardo of rebirth, and its suffering, so those who believe that suicideends their pain are fools. Not only that but Shakyamuni Buddha tells us that the karmicmaturation of the act of suicide is suffering first for eons in hell and then, for most suicides,rebirth as a ghost. Beyond this, they will commit suicide in each of five hundred lifetimes.It is very important, therefore, that we should know the results of our actions and engage intraining that gives meaning to this embodiment.If we are convinced that mind training is not an appropriate activity to pursue during our"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"leisure time, when it comes to shouldering responsibility, we will have no mental basefrom which to proceed. When our leaders challenge other nations, for example, but have notconfronted the deceptive nature of their own mind or even turned within to inspect ordiscuss it, they will surely find themselves at a loss. If their anger and aggression arestrong, and they have the means, they may kill their enemies; and if not, perhaps they willend their life in suicide. In brief, the ignorant activity that follows upon our leaders’chasing after their emotional impulses is a disaster for everyone, including themselves. Forexamples of these things, look into the history of imperial dynasties and of the SecondWorld War.The root cause of such delusion is belief in fame, name, wealth, and power as a validand substantial reality and belief that if we lose them, those virtues will be beyondrecovery. The fault lies in perceiving temporary situations as permanent, predictable,unchangeable, and nondeceptive. When we were cast out of our mother’s womb, we werenot strong, famous, or wealthy. There was no way to recognize our parents or relatives, asneither their bodily forms nor their names appeared for a moment in our previous life’sdreams. “Father,” “mother,” “close relatives,” “friends,” husband,” and “wife” are alllabels. Our egos, believing them to be real, create “my country,” “my wealth,” “myancestral place.” In reality all these things are without substance and without any certainextension in time. Whom we now label as “son” may be our “wife” in the next lifetime, ourpresent “wife” may become our “daughter,” and our best friend our murderer. The house orland we own at present and even our social position and reputation will have been ownedin the past by others. For these reasons, it is nonsense to believe that nominal abstractionsare valid and true. Whatever unfavorable conditions arise, such as sickness, conflict withan enemy, loss of property, or a lawsuit, and so forth, should be understood as illusion.With this perspective, just let go and rest in pure presence, and all experience will becomeone taste in dharmakaya mind.1.26 THE ADVANTAGE OF PERCEIVING ALL THINGS AS MERE CONCEPTUAL LABELS Tibetans consider comets to be bad omens, whereas other peoples think that they areauspicious signs and pray to them. “Auspicious” and “inauspicious” are labels applied toexternal signs or events, but actually there is no need for any positive or negative reactionto comets. Happiness has no essential existence; rather it is a contingent current label. Weshould not miss it, therefore, when it vanishes, and there is no need for us to suffer at itsloss. Nothing can be gained through our endeavors because nothing substantial can beachieved; by the same token, nothing can be lost. If there is something to be gained, it willarise naturally and dissolve naturally. Whatever happens, there is no need for concern.Once when the Dharma King of Derge, Tenpa Tsering, initiated the work of carving thewoodblocks for printing the Kanjur, he asked Palpung Situ Rinpoche to lend him his editionof the canon for reprinting. This request did not please several scholars, and they conspiredto frustrate it. Assuming that, as a high lama, he would firmly believe in omens, they"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"arranged for him to observe some women carrying empty vessels to fetch water in theopposite direction of his grand arrival the next morning. When Rinpoche saw them, he didindeed feel it presaged a bad omen, but suddenly he asked the monks who accompanied himto count the empty vessels. There were eighteen, and when this was reported to Rinpoche,he was delighted since the number eighteen is the auspicious number of the different typesof emptiness counted in the Middle Way metapsychology. He took this as an excellent omenfor the unimpeded work of printing the Kanjur. Because for Dzogchen yogins bad situationsbecome favorable, misfortune for them becoming good fortune, it is said that not a singleobstruction can impede them. All phenomena are just labels.In The Heart Sutra, Bhagawan Buddha said, “There is no path, no primal awareness, noobtainment, no nonobtainment.” If there can be no obtainment of happiness in perfectreality, how can there be any nonobtainment? Since obtainment is the flip side ofnonobtainment, if one of these is established, the other naturally comes with it as potential.If we can see the gain or loss of happiness and sadness as deceptive magical illusion, weare yogins and yoginis who have gained the space of nonaction. If we can see thecomponents of each experience as conceptual labels and if whenever happiness or sufferingarises, we can examine the actual present state of mind and stay with it without grasping,we will experience an awareness of great bliss that we have never experienced before.When we feel exalted, this primal awareness of great bliss can subdue our pride, and whenwe are miserable, it can undermine our suffering. Surely this nonconceptual bliss willreplace both our happiness and our sadness.1.27 WHEN PURE PRESENCE IS SPONTANEOUSLY RECOGNIZED, ITS VEILS NATURALLYDISSOLVE When we realize the reality of the mind free of dualistic perception, that is what is called“buddha.” In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, Simple recognition of the nature of being is labeled “buddha”And with that realization, there is nothing to adopt or to abandonBecause everything is smoothed out into the sole reality—On the Isle of Gold, everything is only gold. The moment that we realize the nature of mind, buddha-nature, the natural perfection ofbeing, there is no need to look anywhere else for it because we have found buddha in ourown bed. We know that from beginningless time in samsara we have taken innumerablebirths and accumulated various good and bad karmas from the twin veils of emotivity andunawareness; in this way, our karmic propensities have become mountainous. Is it possiblethat our obscurations might evaporate without difficulty and we could become buddha in amoment? Even our Shakyamuni attained buddha only after collecting merit over threecountless eons, and if you think that the sutras and tantras assert that buddha cannot be"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"attained without effort, you are indeed right! Those scriptures maintain that withoutpurifying defilements we will not attain buddha, and that logic is irrefutable.However, as discussed above, what we call “obscuration,” “defilement,” or “veil” is nota concrete thing with a substantial nature; if it were so, it could not be eliminated by anyantidote, because no antidote will be effective against something permanent and trulyexistent. The antidote as skillful means is recognized not only in tantra but also in sutra asthe method of purifying all defilements accumulated over eons; defilements accumulatedover eighty thousand years can be purified in a moment. The degree of the method’sefficacy determines the speed at which the defilements can be removed. A thousand men’slabor can be performed by a machine in a few hours, and similarly when we enter upon thetantric path of skillful means, the introduction to naked empty pure presence instantaneouslypurifies the defilements. Eons of accumulated defilements are removed in an instant, just asa cave that has been in darkness for centuries is illuminated in a moment if we simply lighta lamp. Is it more difficult for a lamp to light the darkness of centuries than the darkness ofa single day? Of course not. The point here is that the illumination depends upon the powerof the antidote not upon how deep the darkness or how long it has reigned: a mere instant ofpure presence in its spaciousness purifies, and buddha is attained.The primal awareness of that instant of pure presence is “intrinsic.” In the Voice ofVajra Awareness, Ju Mipham says, It’s so simple that we miss the point,So difficult that it is above our heads. Primal awareness does not require any effort or exertion on our part; it is inherentlyspontaneous. This crucial point is taught by the lama in secret because it is self-evident andeasily understood. We consider that the teaching of the Buddha is so profound that it mustbe, we think, impossible to understand so easily; what is so easy to come by does notinspire confidence, and therefore the secrecy is necessary. On the other hand, through a lackof education, we may not be able to understand the explanations according to the scripturesor the logic of sutra and tantra.If we could originate intrinsic presence by effort and exertion, then necessarily it wouldbe something material, and, if material, then impermanent. If it is impermanent, it partakesof suffering. If pure presence could actually be established anew by effort, the implicationis that reality could be realized by dependence upon a path. But it is not the case that purepresence can be established anew. Although conventionally it may appear that we need tolearn something on a temporal path, in actuality the path, purification, and the traversinghave no substantial existence. When clouds vanish from the sky, it is not the case that newsky is produced. The sky is primordially clear and unchangeable by nature, the clouds areadventitious.When we train on a path over time, what to abandon and what to cultivate, what torealize and realization itself—all these are conventionally distinguished. In reality, intrinsicawareness has never been produced from a cause or conditions but abides naturally,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"absolutely unconditioned. It is seen as nondual subject and object, and this seeing that isnonseeing is called “the realization of the essence of buddha-nature.”In the tantra The Lamp of Immaculate View, it is said. Inasmuch as the inconceivableAppears as an object of mind,The experience is trueBut the object is not real. Just as we say we see form with the eyes, implying that the object and subject are separatewhen in reality they are not, we may say that we see the essence of unelaborated purepresence, reality itself. But that is not yet the realization of the real pure presence, it’s onlyrecognition of subtle mental attachment. Until there is complete exhaustion of mentalconcepts, there is no realization of the dharmakaya. But it is a good sign that self-arisingprimal awareness has been understood. When we have sufficient faith to see our lama as areal buddha, when we see him as a siddha who has the power of blessing of the threetransmissions—mind to mind, symbolic, and oral—in the instant of meeting him face toface, we may taste that profound reality that otherwise would remain unknown to us foreons. In that instant, we can experience the spaciousness of intrinsic presence in whichsubject and object are nondual.Belief may be difficult because the broad exposition—innumerable transmissions andvery subtle logic—in this and previous lifetimes has been unequal to the task of spurringsufficient and effective exertion in hearing, reflecting, and meditating. But even if we strivein training through these, still we cannot absorb the meaning of reality just as it is. Logic issufficient to establish what is here and what is not here; if we examine that logic, its root isthe rational mind of the ordinary being. But when we compare that rational mind with theprimal awareness of the noble ones, it is seen to be merely the delusive dialyzing mind. InEntry into the Middle Way, Chandrakirti says, If worldly cognitive truth is validWhat need of the noble one’s vision?What use is the noble path?Worldly truth has no ultimate validity. Furthermore, The King of Samadhi Sutra states, “The eyes, ears, and nose are notultimately valid.” As Chandrakirti said, the inferences of mundane logic are not ultimatelyvalid. In short, ordinary people cannot cross the fence of dualistic perception, just like a flyin a sealed jam jar cannot fly out of it. Until all thoughts dissolve in the matrix of the greatdharmakaya, pure from the beginning, even the noble ones have no choice but to remain insamsara, much less the rest of us. Without the profound secret instruction of the lama, an individual trying to establish the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"sutric view by study is left only with the intellect to ponder the meaning of reality. Despitehis or her study, his or her thought, even if straight and clear, will not go beyond theparameters of discursive reasoning. Is it possible that such an individual can gainintroduction to the authentic mind—which is reality free of propositions, pure presenceitself—by means of direct indication by the lama? Without accumulation of merit andwithout overcoming difficulties, due to doubts regarding direct perception of purepresence, it is not possible to gain such confidence in one’s own mind. It is possible thatthrough an innate understanding of the oceanlike teaching of Shakyamuni Buddha and thepower of practice one person in a hundred might enter the ultimate arena of the five placesof pure presence and attain buddha through direct perception. For that reason it is said thatthe meaning is not understood because of its difficulty.In this short life of ours, because we have not finished our study of the broad expositionand innumerable transmissions, we think that we are unable to understand the dharmakaya’svoice of logic, and we cannot encounter the rigzin-lama’s blessings or his directintroduction to pure presence. We are like the dung sweeper who cannot believe that hecould ever find a piece of gold in the dung. In that way the easiness of attainment cannot bebelieved and its difficulty cannot be plumbed. In The Essential Heruka Tantra, it is said, The fool depends on faithAnd comes close to siddhi;The brilliant scholar with wisdomAttains supreme accomplishment. The root lama with realized wisdom, able to transmit the various kinds of blessing, is thesingle form of all the buddhas. With faith and trust in him, seeing him as a real buddha, weshould contemplate single-pointedly what he introduces to our mind. By the power of thatlama’s blessing, together with our faith, we will gradually realize pure presence itself; wewill thus gain confidence, optimize our creativity, and attain continuity in nonmeditation. Inthe tantra The Discourse of the General Assembly, it is said, Without serving a teacherBuddha will never be accomplished;I have never seen it happen otherwise;If it happens, it contradicts prophecy. By serving a rigzin-lama and keeping the realization in our mindstream, obscurations arepurified by themselves, and in one lifetime, we will attain the domain of Samantabhadra.Even if we fail in that attainment, without doubt within three or seven lifetimes we willreach the palace of Samantabhadra.In The Three Incisive Precepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, I may attain the Great Perfection in this lifetime,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"But if not, at least I’ll have been happy! Wah!1.28 CREATIVITY IS NECESSARILY RELEASED IN PURE PRESENCE In the pellucid mirrorlike pure presence that is free of all conceptual intrusion, whensuddenly a vivid thought arises, it is called “creativity.” This creativity arises out of basicpure presence. It is the shifting nature of pure presence. Abiding naturally in that supremecognition, creativity and display are rootless and baseless. When we awaken from a dream,both the objective field and the subjective knower vanish into their own space. So too fromour own bed of unchangeable intrinsically aware dharmakaya, from where they cannotmove even a hair’s breadth, the concepts of materiality and specific characteristicsdissolve in release.If we fail to realize that the vivid thoughts, which arise in mirrorlike basic purepresence, are the natural creativity of pure presence itself, from that point onward delusivesamsara, as an apparently true objective stream, beguiles us, as illustrated by the story offather Dawa Drakpa.Once Dawa Drakpa went to work in another man’s house, and by the time he returnedhome, he had earned a ten-kilo bag of barley. Concerned that it might be eaten by mice, hehung the heavy bag up on a beam just above his bed. Then he stretched out on the bed andbegan to think, “I will sell the barley and buy a hen. The hen will give many eggs, and fromthem many chicks will hatch. When the chicks grow up, they will also give many eggs.When I sell all those eggs, I will become rich and take a woman and get married. She willbear me a son, and when he is delivered, I will give him an honest name.” Lying on his bed,thinking of a name for his son, he saw the moon rise and decided to name his son “FamousMoon.” At that very moment a mouse finished nibbling through the thread that held thebarley bag to the beam, and the bag fell upon Dawa Drakpa’s head, killing him.Each and every being’s thoughts, chasing each other along, are delusory at the beginning,in the middle, and through to this very moment, and no one can measure the delusion, noteven the noble ones. Even a magician, who can perform innumerable illusions and sleightsof hand, when he investigates where the illusory objects come from, where they abide, andwhere they vanish, must remain unconvinced of the objects’ reality when the nature of theillusion itself is emptiness.A man dreamt so vividly that a very handsome son was born to him that, in the dream,when the son fell sick, he grieved, and when the son died, he was so sad that he criedaloud. When he awoke, he realized that he did not have a wife, so he could not possiblyhave fathered a son, and thus there was no way he could be happy at the son’s birth, sad athis sickness, or grief-stricken at his death. In the dream, at the beginning, the son’s birthseemed real, in the middle, the son’s sickness seemed real, and at the end, his death seemedreal. The circumstances of dream make us suffer exceedingly. When we awake andunderstand that the beginning, middle, and end of the dream are all figments of the mind andthat there is not an iota of substance or a specific attribute that exists, then our suffering"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"dissolves like mist in the morning sun. To overcome that suffering, it is imperative to striveon the path of awakening, to understand that the dream is unfounded and that there is noother way than this path to defeat it. To that end we rest all the creative appearances ofdualistic samsara in pure presence and thus release them.Until we recognize creativity itself as the magical illusion of pure presence, until wehave gained confidence, optimized our creativity, and attained release, we must train on agradual path.1.29 SAMSARA NEVER EXISTED EXCEPT AS MERE CREATIVE VISIONS Some people ask urgently, “Where did the very first sentient being come from?” and “Whatwas the cause?” I would like to address that question here. Metaphorically speaking,samsara consists of the universe as the container and living beings as the nectar that itcontains. According to both the Theravada and Mahayana traditions, the cause of both theuniverse as container and the beings living within it are emotional afflictions. The emotionsare the source of both karma and the source of further affliction. The external universe ascontainer has innumerable associated causes, and these seven—seed, shoot, leaf, trunk,stem, pith, flower, and fruit—serve as examples of the causal process, while the sixassociated conditions—earth, water, fire, air, space, and time—serve as examples of theconditions in which that process operates. The living beings that are the elixir in thecontainer emerge from the sources of karma and emotion: ignorance, volition,consciousness, name and form, sense fields, contact, sensation, craving, grasping,becoming, birth, old age, and death. From these interrelated causes and conditions, the sixelemental physical qualities of beings arise, namely, earth, water, fire, air, space, andconsciousness. And where does the current karmic seed come from? It originates from theprevious seed. And where does the previous seed come from? It originates from the onepreceding the previous and so on without end. Neither religion nor science has any credibleanswer to the question of the origination of an original seed, and thus we may infer thatthere is continuity or that it is beginningless like a circle. For that reason our BuddhaShakyamuni has called the outer container “cyclic existence” or “samsara.”Therefore, in response to the question, “Where do the living beings within the containercome from?” the answer is that rebirth follows from old age and death. “Where does oldage and death come from?” They follow from birth. “Where does birth come from?” Itarises from becoming and then successively in reverse through all the twelveinterdependent links of origination until we arrive once again at the question “Where doesignorance come from?” It arises from old age and death. In this way we circle continuouslyin samsara, which is like a wheel. So it is called “cyclic.” Since everything alwaysdepends upon a previous concatenating cause, we call it a “cycle.” If we think, however,that this circular progression is true and real, it is definitely not so!In The Great Matrix Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in One Hundred Thousand Verses, at"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"the time of his teaching on the twentyfold emptiness, Shakyamuni Buddha said, “There isneither beginning nor end in emptiness.” There is nothing in samsara that can be calledeither a beginning or an end. If we investigate this samsara that is without beginning or endand in which live the beings whose appearances arise out of their own karma, we find it tobe like a dream and an illusion. In its identity, it has no going or coming, and it abides in itsown empty essence in the emptiness that has neither beginning nor end. The attachment thatarises out of desire for samsara, and the terror of it that arises out of apprehension iseliminated. The Buddha does not speak of a beginning or an end to samsara because heknows no beginning or end. Just as samsara has neither beginning nor end, there is nobeginning nor end to emptiness.In the tantra The Discourse of the General Assembly, it is said, Air is established in the sky,And the water aggregate is established in air;In water earth is established,And beings are established on earth.Beings depend on karma,So their causes are as stated thus.What supports the sky?This is the point to examine! Asked “What do human beings depend upon?” we can answer: the earth. “Upon what doesearth depend?” Water. “Upon what does water depend? Air. “Upon what does airdepend?” The sky. But if we are asked upon what does space depend, ordinary peoplecannot answer, and even great scientists are left dumb. Shakyamuni Buddha, knowing thereality of all things, said that nothing has any true existence. Thus he is known asomniscient, praised by all gods and people.In the tantras it is understood that all external, mundane things like mountains, houses,wealth, and so on, cannot be known and experienced and proven to exist as more thanmental projections or mental appearances. Internally, the mind itself cannot be establishedas anything other than the creativity of pure presence, the essential nature of mind. Thatspontaneously arisen pure presence, timelessly free of any blemish, abides in its own spaceas the buddha-potential of the dharmakaya. We must understand that it always stays in thespace of the unconditioned essence.1.30 IN UNCONDITIONED PURE PRESENCE, ALL BUDDHA-POTENTIAL IS SPONTANEOUSLYMANIFEST The primal awareness of intrinsic presence, beyond expression and understanding, is saidin all the tantras to be essentially unconditioned. In the tantra Magnificent UnelaboratedClear Meaning, it is said,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" In all definitive teaching, in the agamas and tantras,The great intrinsic awarenessIs expressed in vajralike words,Unchangeable and unconditioned. Furthermore, in the sutra The Inexhaustible Mind, it is said, Consciousness passes;Primal awareness lasts. While the Gandavyuha Sutra states, Although in the mundane worldEverything conceivable may burn,The sky will not perish,Nor will intrinsic awareness. Intrinsic primal awareness, timelessly undeluded, is buddha. If we believe that delusionmust always arise in sentient beings, consider that it can never enter the ground of being. Itis not possible for the ground of being to be deluded. Then how does delusion arise?Delusion arises through the dualistic perception of subject and object in the creativevisions that appear in the ground of being. With realization of the gestalt imagery of theground of being as just that—naturally envisioned appearances—we are released into theall-good ground. In the spaciousness of the ground of being, both release and delusion arepure from the beginning. Whatever in samsara or nirvana appears in the ground can nevermove from that ground, and the ground can never be anything other than the essence ofpurity. Thus the distinctions of “ground,” “path and fruit,” “the world,” “beings,” “nirvana,”“pure realms,” and any infinite spaces that appear can never escape the spaciousness of theground of being. In that space both ornamentation and display appear.In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, In brief, in the spontaneity of this vast womblike spaciousness,What seems to be samsara or nirvana is a display of creativity,Which at its inception can be known as neither samsara nor nirvana.No matter what dream arises in the creativity of sleep,In truth, it is only a pleasant moment of intrinsic presence,The all-pervasive smoothness of the vastness of ubiquitous sameness! In this Great Completion, there is not a single experience in samsara, nirvana, or the pathfrom one to the other that has not been included. Therefore it is called “complete.” If wecould only hold to the dharmakaya crux of empty pure presence, we would abide naturallyand spontaneously in the vision of Direct Crossing. With the dharmakaya mind of pure"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"presence and the sambhogakaya radiance of pure presence, we abide in ultimacy. Here theradiance of pure presence is spontaneously arisen vision because the inner light of thecentral pathway that hits the eye is not adulterated by delusion. On the path of the fourlamps (the lamp of pure spaciousness, the lamp of empty seed-essence, the lamp of intrinsicwisdom, and the lamp of continual pure presence), if we take the fructified trikaya, the threedimensions of being, as the path, there is no doubt that we will attain the mature body oflight that is the rainbow body. Pure presence and the radiance of pure presence are just likefire and its heat or the sun and its light, which cannot be separated at all.These distinctions of Cutting Through [trekcho] and Direct Crossing [togel] are resolvedin intrinsic awareness, which is their sole root, so it is crucially important at the beginning,in the middle, and at the end to realize that we abide therein. When unconditioned intrinsicawareness exists in the mindstream of all sentient beings, how can defilements andobscurations arise? We may think that we need the power of the sun or a lamp or electricityto remove darkness, but actually that is not true. A wolf does not need light to see in thedark. And, actually, nothing need be abandoned as nothing has substantial existence. Thesky is completely clear and primordially free of dark and light. If we know that darkness isnot an object of rejection, since it is the nature of the clear light of the sky, there is no needto eliminate anything. When primal awareness is revealed, there is not the slightest thingcalled “defilement” or “obscuration” that is to be rejected!We will be released by the realization that everything is the intrinsic creativity of purepresence. When we fail in this understanding, holding object and subject as two, wewander in samsara where we need to depend upon antidotes and gradual progress on a pathof cultivating the good and rejecting the bad. Applying ourselves to a process with theimpure delusions of the vision of ordinary beings, or with the pure or impure vision ofyogins or yoginis, as the case may be, or even with the Buddha’s pure vision, there is noway to avoid the distinctions inherent in the rejection of some sensory appearances, theacceptance of antidotes, the graduation of stages and paths, and the difference betweenkarmic cause and effect.In the ultimate analysis, the stages and paths and the categories of what to cultivate andwhat to reject have never existed as an ordered structure in the sky’s nature.1.31 WHEN WE ABIDE IN UNCHANGEABLE MIND, THERE IS ENORMOUS INSTANT ADVANTAGE Whether we are concerned about this life or the next, we need to become familiar with theunchangeable aspect of mind. If we do not remain constantly in that unchangeable mind,even mundane work, let alone worship, will never be finished in this lifetime, whether it istrade, farming, politics, and so forth. No matter what our endeavor, given that the plan isdeemed doable by the experts, if we work resolutely and with constancy, then one day itwill be completed. Fickle-minded people, even if knowledgeable, may fail to firstinvestigate the project properly, and if they do investigate it, the investigation may be"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"incomplete. When difficulties arise and the work is postponed, it will not be finished. Latersuch people regret that the investigation was not done properly. In car accidents, even aslight distraction of mind allows a fatal accident to happen. Or, in construction of abuilding, if a slight error occurs in the measurement of the horizontal level, a hugedifference in the proportion of the structure can result. Likewise, when we are afraid andanxious and become overexcited and lose our cool, grave disaster can strike just at thatmoment. In the same way that we cannot see what is at the bottom of the pail if we stir thewater, and just as the more we rub our eyes, the less we can see, when mind isoverstimulated and overexcited when solving a problem, the work stops, and we are leftunable to proceed, without a sliver of attention remaining. Just as when we wind a threadtoo tightly, it will break, so if we put too much pressure on the mind, its continuity willbreak, and we will be left in utter puzzlement. The root error here in all these situations isan absence of knowledge about mind. If our mind is at ease and at the same time alert, thenany work we perform happens with mindfulness and acuity, and our mind will remainunchanged. If we perform our work with unchanging and unfailing concentration, the resultmust always be excellence.Once there was man called “Riklhun” who one day was returning to his house through theforest when two men suddenly attacked him. One caught him from behind and the other,standing in front of him, took out an axe and struck out at his head. Riklhun reacted likegreased lightning, bending his head just enough so that the axe struck the man holding himfrom behind, killing him. The axe man fled. Riklhun laughed and continued on to his house.Later, the would-be murderer, though Riklhun’s enemy, praised his courage.Riklhun’s slight but fast movement of the head saved his life. Whatever the emergencymay be, it is mindfulness that makes the big difference. Another example: at the moment ofbeing carried away by floodwater, we need mindfulness to keep ourselves from panic andsave ourselves from drowning.Once, in Nepal, the prime minister, Man Mohan, was flying in a helicopter with his fourescorts to an outlying destination. While the helicopter was is in the air, its tail fan stoppedworking, and within two or three minutes, there was a danger of fire. The prime ministerordered the pilot to throw out all the gasoline from the helicopter and to land immediately.The pilot did as he was told, and the helicopter landed safely on the ground; thereby thepilot saved his own life as well as the others’. Later the prime minister gave a pressconference, saying that a quick decision was needed in the couple of minutes during whichtheir lives could be saved, and that decision, together with the resolve of the pilot, savedtheir lives. If a firm mind is required in a practical situation, then how much more so is itneeded in taming our minds, and how great a benefit could accrue from that in this lifetime!The best method of stabilizing the mind—realizing its unchangeable aspect—is theDzogchen meditation of nonaction. Not only does it facilitate the accomplishment ofmundane activities, it also releases us from the sufferings of samsara. Anyway, we need toattain constancy in pure presence."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"1.32 UNCONTROLLED EMOTION EFFECTS SEVERE ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE If we believe that the material world should be controlled and manipulated for our pleasureand ease, and we act accordingly, we should consider the collateral damage we cause. Inthe past few centuries, scientists have invented machines that can travel through the air,under water, and under the earth. This has allowed us to travel easily, eat better food, andwear better clothes, and it has facilitated communication through e-mail, television, andvideo. We have better furniture, better heating in winter and cooling in summer, and, withelectricity, we can turn night into day. Scientists are still improving their inventions andcontriving new ones.All this activity is admirable. But if we look at the other side of the coin, excessiveproduction brings many negative side effects and an imbalance in the four elements. Thesenegative effects are becoming increasingly evident. The earth is becoming warmer andwarmer, and the ice of many centuries is melting, and some countries may eventually beflooded. Moreover, some kinds of birds, animals, trees, and grasses will become extinct.The majority of scientists are now predicting such results. An imbalance of the fourelements will produce catastrophe. Predictions are that the suffering will be a hundredtimes greater than that of the Second World War.The root cause here is people’s greed. Even though this world belongs to all the sentientbeings who live in it, human beings monopolize and utilize its resources for their ownexclusive benefit, at the same time producing chemicals that pollute air, water, and earth.Through an imbalance of the elements, many animals, insects, trees, and plants that resideand grow in water and earth will become extinct. Ignorant of the fact that we areaccelerating our own demise in this world, we proceed with “development” without theleast concern for others. And this development is related to the fame and strength of thecountries called “superpowers.” Consider the person who puts himself or herself on thewrong side of the saw and cuts off the branch of the tree that he or she is sitting on. This isan example of crass foolishness, and it is not appropriate to compare the development workof the wise people of our world with such idiocy. On the other hand, to consciously ignoreprotecting the endangered environment and the four elements is very stupid.What Shakyamuni Buddha teaches is that moderation and self-contentment is much moreacceptable to the noble ones than the path of greed. Such teaching is like the white medicinethat acts as a panacea, balancing the four elements and bringing peace to the world andharmony to its people. This path brings happiness in this life and the next, and for thatreason we should all follow it.1.33 THE DZOGCHEN PROCESS NECESSARILY AND NATURALLY PRESERVES THEENVIRONMENT It is important to keep both outer and inner things unmodified. Until the mind is kept in itsauthentic state without modification and without fabrication, neither the external nor the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"internal worlds can be kept in the same natural manner. Mental contrivance is the maincause of ecological imbalance. For this reason, first, we need to keep pure presenceunmodified and free of greedy thoughts and other emotions so that we remain empty of anyneed for control of the exterior. Then gradually the imbalance of the external ecology willbe rectified, and the mind will be free of attachment, aversion, ignorance, and delusion sothat contentment arises naturally. With this contentment, striving for development willdecrease, and this will help to reduce global warming.About contentment, Sri Saraha sang, Contentment is the ultimate wealth;Detachment is the final happiness. This is surely true. So we need to strive to tame the mind and give it stability. There aremany experts in this world who presume to train the mind, but there is none better than theBuddha.Once king Bimbisara of Magadha gave an elephant to an elephant trainer and asked himto train it well, promising that he would be handsomely rewarded. After many months oftraining, the elephant was completely obedient. The trainer then presented the elephant tothe king, and the king was delighted, and gave the trainer a large gift. But one day when theking and his two queens were riding the elephant in the forest, enjoying the beauty of nature,the elephant, suddenly paying no attention to the king’s commands, went mad andstampeded. The king and his queens thought that they would be thrown off and killed, butthey were lucky enough to become caught up in the branches of a tree, which surely savedtheir lives. The elephant was lost in the forest. Back at the palace, the king ordered theelephant trainer brought before him and accused him of lying and incompetently training theelephant. The king threatened a dire punishment. The trainer protested that he had trainedthe elephant’s body but that he could not control its mind. “When the smell of a femaleelephant entered his nostrils, he went mad and had to run to her,” he said “Wait a few days,and after the elephant has mated with the female, he will return.” The king gave the trainerthe benefit of the doubt and waited for a few days, and the elephant did indeed return. Whenpresented before the king, the trainer ordered the elephant to pick up a bar of burning iron.The elephant did this without hesitation. The king thus regained faith in the trainer. “Who isthe best mindtrainer?” the king asked the trainer. “Shakyamuni Buddha!” came the reply.Practicing buddha-dharma, we should tame the mind; thereby we will gain the wealth ofcontentment as well as release from both attachment to external objects and striving afterthem. The ecological balance will be redressed thereby, and the environment will benefit.Consider these events: my enemy has harmed me, so I am going to confront him, fighthim, defeat him, and teach him a lesson; my girlfriend is having an affair with another man,so I am going to beat her so that she will not do it again. We think that through aggressionwe can control the external world and be happy, but such thinking is just the common errorof ordinary people. In The Thirty-Seven Practices of the Bodhisattva, Ngulchu Tokmesays,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" If the inner enemy “Hatred” remains untamed,Though the external enemy is defeated,The hatred toward him will increase. Unless we tame our own minds, there is no possibility of controlling the external world.The male drunk who staggers down the road thinks that the ground is shaking and sees onething as two things and two things as one. All kinds of thoughts pass through his head:sometimes he feels happy and sings, sometimes he feels sad and cries, sometimes he getsangry, and so on. But like the sensation of the ground moving, it is all subjective delusion.The concepts that arise in the drunk’s mind are all due to inebriation. Regarding the shakingof the ground, it is said in The King of Samadhi Sutra, When one is intoxicated by tainted chang,Though the ground is still,It appears to be shaking:Regard all phenomena as delusory! Though external objects have no substantial existence, attachment to them grows bypresuming their permanence and concrete reality. It is adulterating dualistic perception thatimputes concreteness and permanence to things and then labels them as intrinsically happyor sad, depending upon the subjective bias. The intellectualizing mind generates theimputation, the delusion appears in mind, and this mistake about the nature of mind initiatesperpetual wandering in samsara. For this reason, we need to identify with the changelessnature of mind. As we recognize changelessness, all labels, appearances, and delusionsnaturally disappear. We perceive that the mind is only mental projection. Then, through thepower of meditation on mind, freed thus of the veneer of dualistic grasping, we abide in thespace of the great dharmakaya of unchangeable empty pure presence, released into thesphere of permanent happiness.Great scientists have invented machines to fly in the sky, ships to cruise the seas,microscopes to see very tiny things, and many other wonders. People think that in this waythese scientists have achieved greatness. But this planet earth (much less other planets) hasitself not even been completely explored, which is something scientists themselves freelyadmit. They may investigate a given phenomenon thoroughly, but there are infinitely manythings in this universe to explore, and it is impossible to examine them all.In the past, the buddhas and bodhisattvas could fly in the sky. They could also foretell thefuture: for example, the great Pema Lingpa predicted some five hundred years ago theadvent of Mahatma Gandhi. These accomplishments give proof that they understood thenature of all experience. In the nineteenth century, when Tibet was not known for havingany modern technology, Ju Mipham Rinpoche invented a small bomb and displayed itspotential to some of his disciples. He told them that if it was made bigger, it could be ofsome small usefulness, but that some people would likely misuse it, and grave"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"consequences would ensue. So he stopped its development. As Mipham Rinpoche said,scientists may have provided us all with good food and easy transportation and otherbenefits, but when we ponder seriously the deadly weapons that were produced by someignorant nations, we cannot enjoy that food or even sleep well at night. Once, when theextraordinary scholar Gendun Chophel was on the way to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, hesurprised many people by inventing a small wooden boat that could travel over the waterby itself. He told people that if they were to construct the same boat according to a muchlarger and better design, then they would be able to travel across the great ocean.Seeing that the root of all suffering is the mind’s delusion, the noble beings of the past,though quite capable of scientific invention, chose instead to focus their efforts first incutting the roots of disturbing emotions, and then in exemplifying the path of ShakyamuniBuddha.These days the United States is like a small pure-land with many advanced technologiesand facilities—yet many Americans have mental problems. Mental problems create moresuffering than does physical disease. As Ju Mipham says in his Traditional Shastra, The suffering of hunger is great,But the endless suffering of mind is greater. Stories of people committing suicide by starving themselves are very rare. People willalways try to feed themselves and save themselves from hunger. Mental suffering can betemporarily relieved by consuming good food, drinking alcohol, or singing and dancing. Butthat is not an ultimate solution, so we hear of many cases of suicide. If the root cause ofsuffering, the root of mind, is not severed, no matter what method we employ, we will notbe free of suffering and the binds of delusion. Even if we are born in a pure-land, we willnot enjoy happiness. The Amitabha Sutra says, “Those bodhisattvas and bodhisattvaniswho are born in the pure-land of Sukhavati have no ego, no sense of ‘I’ and ‘you.’ They aremale and female buddha-deities.”As the peerless yogin Milarepa sang, Knowing one’s mind as the dharmakaya,That is better than meeting the Buddha. Knowing the nature of mind and its natural perfection is far better than meeting a buddhapersonally. To repeat a famous line, in The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpasays, “Simple recognition of the nature of being is called ‘buddha.’” The very moment thenature of mind is seen as primal awareness, we understand that the word “buddha” refers tonothing beyond that recognition.1.34 ILLUSTRATING THAT ALL THINGS ARISE OUT OF THE BASIS OF MIND"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The question, “Is everything rooted in mind?” has been addressed at length in earliersections. Here I will discuss this in brief. All happiness and suffering arise from mind.Different beings perceive external appearances according to their own envisionment—water can be seen as a drink or a place of residence and so on.The ground of being is the luminous mind, but a buddha’s pure envisionment and theimpure envisionment of ordinary beings are determined differently by karma. Everythingemerges from the power of the mind as magical illusion. To that some people may respond,“Well, how can so much variety arise out of a single base?” The answer is that it is like theway that all trees, vegetation, minerals, and precious stones appear out of the one earthbeneath our feet. Further, modern scientists believe that all things in the world arecomposed of atomic particles; surely all of samsara and nirvana are composed of luminousmind in a similar way. An even closer parallel is the variety of images of individual’sfaces that can appear on the single surface of a mirror. In a real sense, the nature of externalphenomena and mind is one: the nature of mind is nowhere to be seen in any direction, noris it limited to any one place or any particular conceptual imposition.If we investigate this external world, we find neither unity nor multiplicity. If it is a unity,it is not a plurality; if it is a plurality, it is not a unity. Since it is not one or the other, itremains in emptiness. This emptiness is not like a sky-flower or the son of a barren womanbecause external objects are undeniably visible. They are seen just like the reflection of themoon in water: it is visible, but when we come to look for it in the container, no moon canbe found. If we do not investigate conventional appearances, they seem to exist; but withinvestigation, since neither the external object nor the internal mind can be found to haveany substantial existence whatsoever, we can say that neither has any existence.If mind and external objects have no substantial existence, some people might wonderhow suffering can arise from them. What is the use of meditation if nothing has any inherentexistence? Quite so. Ignorant of this absence of any substantial existence in either externalphenomena or in beings residing in the world, we conceive of a substantial “I” or ego andthe notion of others “out there”; attachment and aversion then arise from perceived goodand bad. This starts us down the long river of suffering. When we understand perfectly thatthere is nothing substantial anywhere, suffering will cease to arise. Consider a dream inwhich we are being eaten by a ferocious tiger or are falling over a steep precipice. If weknew at the time of suffering that we were dreaming, then, certain of being deceived, wewould automatically find release from our terror.Dream fantasies are sometimes happy—they are not always sad. Not only in dreams butalso in movies—which we know to have been made by professionals—the audience stillcries during sad scenes and laughs at comic ones. Why do we laugh and cry even though weknow that the movie is a fiction? The happiness and sadness ensues from attachment toappearances; if we have a strong conviction of appearances as insubstantial, no suchfeelings will arise. If we are unable to detach our minds from the movie as we watch it,how then under duress from an aggregation of past imprints can we detach our minds in reallife? From beginningless samsara we have been attached to things through different"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"activities, and, like a potter’s wheel after he or she has ceased spinning it, the wheel of lifecontinues under its own momentum.At present, during a meditation session, is it possible that our habitual grasping at objectscould be abandoned suddenly? Some students, having met a great guru, come to know thetruth of unreality, and, practicing for months and even years, receive great benefit in thislife. They develop strong faith in the teaching and completely change their manner ofconduct, just like turning their clothes inside out. Such a yogin or yogini is observed to bemore polite, more kindly, in short, to be a person with many good qualities. There are somepeople, it is true, who, though they have received teaching and done meditation and soforth, claim that they have not been helped in any way. But consider the case of a doctorwho prescribes medicine for HIV/AIDS or TB, with the instruction to take it every day forseveral months or years. If the patient takes it for only a few days and then argues that itwas no help, that premature judgment is invalid. If the medicine had been taken for asufficient length of time, surely it would have healed the patient. If we take instruction froma reliable lama, not for the sake of association with some famous teaching, but in order totrain the mind until we attain the final accomplishment, we should strive in hearing,reflection, and meditation.1.35 WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE INSEPARABILITY OF APPEARANCES ANDEMPTINESS, VISION IS NATURALLY SUFFUSED BY INFINITE PURITY Once we are certain that all phenomena are unreal mental projections, we no longer have toventure outside to other places to look for a pure-land realm. The place that we are in, hereand now, appears as a pure-land paradise. During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s,Minling Chung Rinpoche was given the duty of cleaning up excrement around the Barkor. Awoman took that duty upon herself to pay reverence to the Rinpoche, but one day Rinpocheasked the woman to refrain from doing that work for him, as he could do it for himself. Shetold Rinpoche that the smell was obnoxious. Rinpoche said, “To you it may smell bad, butto me it is a sweet aroma.” In the period leading up to death, realized beings may seeimpure things as pure. Just before death, as ordinary appearances vanish into spaciousness,they see appearances as the Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain pure-land. When they gobeyond, tents of rainbow light and other auspicious signs may be seen. Those watching maybe inspired thereby. There are many stories to be told in this regard.Buddhas themselves are visibly saturated with purity, while others, like Shakyamuni’sdisciple Sariputra and fortunate beings with just a little obscuration, have pure vision. Oncewhen Vimalamitra came to Tibet, he saw king Trisong Deutsen as Avalokiteshvara seatedon a turquoise throne, wearing the crown of the five buddha-families. Vimalamitra lookedup into the sky, uttering OM AH HUNG SWAHA while snapping his fingers five times. Thebuddhas of the five families appeared, and the king and his subjects all saw them clearlyand obtained steadfast faith. All fortunate beings like them enjoy pure vision."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Again, once, while Marpa Lotsawa was seated on his throne deeply absorbed inmeditation, his disciple Marpa Golok came to see him, and in place of Marpa Lotsawa, hesaw the real Vajradhara on the throne. Later, when he asked Marpa about it, Marpa replied,“It was a coincidence that, when I was meditating upon my personal deity Vajradhara, yourdefilements diminished, and you saw that vision.” To obtain that pure vision, it is necessaryto have diminished obscuration; then, with faith, there is confidence in the illusions ofemptiness and appearance in union.Once, when Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje was giving an empowerment at Menyag Lhagang,everyone saw the lama as Avalokiteshvara seated on the throne with one thousand arms andeyes. Doubtless the lucky people who saw him had diminished defilements andobscurations.1.36 A FINGER POINTING DIRECTLY AT PURE PRESENCE If we put all of this in a nutshell, no matter what the quality of the view, whether we arehappy or sad, whether appearances are fearful or pleasant, whether mind is active orpassive, we should not tilt our mind toward any antidote. Whatever appears, look nakedlyat the essence of the appearance as it arises, and, without modifying it in any way, just let itbe. Then pure presence in all its radiance arises from within.In his Lifeblood of the Mountain Retreat, Dudjom Rinpoche says, Whatever the sensory field, whatever the object, gaze at it like a child enrapt before analtar in a temple. Don’t clutch the sensory specifics; hold to the freshness. Let it be inits own place without contriving anything about it, without changing its shape orcomplexion and without adulterating it with any conceptual fixations. Then allappearances will arise as the naked primal awareness of clarity and emptiness in purepresence. In The Chariot of Omniscience, Jigme Lingpa says, Objective appearance in pure presence does not crystallize, and since pure presencecannot mingle with the object, the perceptual dualism of samsara is like a drawing inwater, and there is Saraha smiling serenely, the renouncing and the antidote reflexivelyreleased. Without revealing any attachment or rejection to the pure presence thatthereby does not slip into the objective field, there is Phadampa Sangye, shining, in thespace of liberation of samsara and nirvana. The five sensory stimuli—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects—do notcrystallize in the five doors of perception, and whatever arises is allowed to arise just as itis. When the consciousness (pure presence) is not mixed up with the objective aspect ofform and so on, when it does not slip into the object, the nature of dualistic samsara"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"vanishes, just as a drawing in water vanishes as it is drawn. What is abandoned has nomaterial attribute, and its antidote has no attribute, and in that moment of arising,grandfather Saraha, laughing, found the space of reflexive liberation.When, on the basis of the lama’s instruction, we realize the profound import of the viewand recognize the nature of mind as pure presence, bright and nonconceptualized, we willhave experienced it and thus will have no need to either describe it to others or discuss itsontological status. With an inner conviction that what we call “our mind,” “the subjectiveknower abiding in nonthought,” and so on, is meaningless, we will find born within us adeep abiding confidence that in itself is sufficient. Concerning the production of thisprofound confidence, we cannot realize the natural state of mind by any other means thanreliance upon a rigzin-lama’s blessing and oral instruction.In the sutras of the Approach with Signs, which contain the highest Mahayana view, manyprofound truths are established by direct perception and inferential logic, but in the end theydo not go beyond the intellect. Although we mouth the words “empty” and “beyondconceptual elaboration,” such words remain mere semantic expressions because the mindcannot conceive them. There is no release from our dualistic bonds. If the nature of themind is not seen directly in nondual vision, however it is expressed, dualisms can beneither transcended nor resolved. When we are holding a burning coal in our hand, unlesswe drop it, we cannot prevent the pain, no matter how much we cry. In the sutras of theApproach with Signs, in the Madhyamaka Prasangika school, and in the outer, inner, andsupreme yoga-tantra schools—in all approaches below the level of the secret precept classof Dzogchen Atiyoga—propositions that tend to crystallize reality are resolvedsuccessively and gradually because in those schools nondual perception is not recognizedas a valid means of proof. Due to the existence of higher and lower approaches and fasterand slower paths, there is a gradation in the profundity of blessing. In The Treasury of theDharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, Until we realize—experientially—the field of self-sprung sameness,We may verbally obsess with the term “nonduality”And speculate confidently about what is nonreferential,But such egregious thinking is dark and ignorant. In Dzogchen, first, at the feet of a rigzin-lama, we are introduced to the actual experience ofprimal awareness. In light of this, all speculative concepts and assumptions belonging to theApproach with Signs surely vanish, and we “see” without any conceptual elaboration. If wefail to experience it directly, though perhaps wise in the dialectics of Dzogchen, we are noteven close to the natural state of being, and we do not deserve the name “Dzogchen yogin.”As Drubchen Pema Dewai Gyelpo says in The Rampant Lion, If the authentic nature of being is not known,Caught by the spirit of fundamentalism,The pains of bigoted sectarianism well up,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"And we are trapped in a net of karmic proclivitiesOf ignorant dualistic appearances. In The Heart-Essence of Vimalamitra, Longchenpa says, It is taught by the Lama Vimalamitra, that buddha will never be attained on the paths ofthe nine graduated approaches by engaging in their view, meditation, and conduct.Why not? Because in the views of the nine approaches, there is only intellectualconjecture that is sometimes convincing and sometimes not, but which can neverinduce the naked essence. In the same source, Longchenpa quotes the rigzin Garab Dorje saying, A view based on speculative thought brings suffering;Meditation derived from it creates a foggy mind;Activity based on it brings weariness;And any hope of result is total delusion. Below the secret precept class of Dzogchen Atiyoga, each successive lower approachviews the one beneath it as inadequate, inasmuch as each depends upon speculative thought.Most especially, the sutras of the Approach with Signs, which teach speculative deductivelogic as being the leader, assume that the nature of mind cannot be realized directly in thespaciousness of pure presence. In the Approach with Signs, regardless of the profundity ofthe mind’s meditation, there is only mere replacement of one dualistic concept by another.This method does not engage the reality of Dzogchen’s natural state or the natural perfectionof mind. However high it flies, a bird must always land; if there is no crucial realization ofself-arising/self-releasing mind, then any effort is eventually only a cause of fatigue. AsDrubchen Pema Dewai Gyelpo says in The Rampant Lion, Without realizing the crux of self-arising/self-releasing,Reification, with its heavy suffering, causes fatigue;If we do not understand primordial reflexive release,There is no liberation from samsara’s rebirths.1.37 REASONS FOR THE NECESSITY TO SEEK A RIGZIN-LAMA TO INTRODUCE PURE PRESENCE To receive a good introduction to the completely liberating view of Dzogchen, we need toserve a rigzin-lama, a Dzogchen yogin.In the tantra The Compendium of Pure Presence, it is said, Without consulting wise teachers,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"A Buddha cannot appear;Without a teacher no Buddha has ever appeared—It would be contrary to prophecy. After completing his studies of sutra and tantra at Samye, Longchen Rabjampa, the crownjewel of the scholars and sages of the Land of Snow, a second buddha, was known as theSamye Savant, with knowledge equivalent to all the Six Ornaments and Two Excellenciesof India. He was an incomparable genius free of all bias. But the bodhisattva Tara told himin a vision that his lineal lama was the mahasiddha Kumaraja. Immediately Longchenpastood up and went to find him and, once there, requested the heart-essence [nying-tik]teaching and received many transmissions.The great Naropa was a famous pandita at the Vikramashila Academy in India, and therehe saw a vision of the Dakini who told him, “You are now an expert in words; go and seethe mahasiddha Tilopa and train yourself experientially in the natural perfection of reality.”And Naropa went to serve Tilopa.The hermit lord Dewai Gyelpo spent many years in retreat and became accomplished inthe creative and fulfillment stages, and he exhibited many signs as clear as a rainbow on asummer’s day. But he was left with some attachments, however, and later on, when he raninto Traktung Dudjom Lingpa, the latter shouted at him, “Now tell us the signs of yourexperience!” And with the chaff of conceptually elaborated signs all dissolving into space,the mind of the lama and the disciple become inseparable. Relying upon that experience,Dewai Gyelpo gained realization. To find the natural state of mind that is the greatperfection, there is no other way than through a lama. Furthermore, we need to depend uponsuch a one with faith, pure vision, and devotion. If we recognize our lama as buddha, thenwe will receive the blessings of buddha; if we recognize our lama as a yogin, then we willreceive the blessings of a yogin; and if we see our lama as an ordinary human being, thenwe will receive no blessings at all. As the sutras say, Whoever has yearning aspirationSits in front of buddha. And as the tantras say, The lama is the Buddha;The lama is the Dharma;The lama is the Sangha;He is the incomparable creator,The Heruka, the great and glorious guru. Real blessings will only come from a rigzin-lama. As is said, “The rigzin-lama’s followersreceive the accomplishment.” Moreover, in The Aspiration of Ground, Path, and Fruit, JuMipham says, “Through the power of the lama’s precept, may I see!”"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"If we understand the Dzogchen view completely, powerful kindness will arise in ustoward those sentient beings of the six realms continuously plagued by suffering who havenot understood as much as we have because of the curse of their attachment to samsara’sbewildering deceptive illusions as something substantial and real. As Shantarakshita saysin The Ornament of the Middle Way, Toward those who have not understood,Compassion arises. Such loving-kindness arises effortlessly. Just as a mother instinctively becomes anxiouswhen her toddler runs in play hither and thither across a flat roof without balustrades, so theyogin who understands that all phenomena are mental delusion feels a patient love forpeople engaged in subduing enemies, caring for kith and kin, accumulating wealth andimproving reputation—in short, for all the people who are bound in an environment of painby the concretization of their delusions. With this understanding, bearing in mind thedelusiveness of karmic result, we can nondelusively see karmic cause and effect working inspecific cases, and strong confidence will arise in us. This is proof of correct view, orbuddha-potential manifest. If, at the very center of mind, we lack a clear understanding ofthe view free of all bias, we are then ignorant of karmic cause and effect and withoutcompassion for sentient beings, and we will wander like a blind man left in the middle of alarge field, not knowing where to go. Ignorant of the view and thus bewildered, even if wewalk the path of liberation and enact the conduct of the six perfections, we will remainordinary beings.In the context of the sutras, no matter what effort is applied to prove through logic andscriptural authority the reality of emptiness—the emptiness that is profoundly liberating andfree of all conceptual elaboration—we cannot go beyond deductive hypotheses andspeculative concepts. When the sutric mind investigates phenomena and discoversnonexistence, it takes it to be nothingness; when it discovers the absence of nonexistence, ittakes that to be a constant. When it holds both existence and nonexistence together, it cannotconceive of both existent objects and nonexistent objects simultaneously. If the unity ofexistence and nonexistence is emphasized, the sutric mind tends to conceive of black andwhite threads wound together, and it can go no further. Such beginners, who understandreality only through intellectual analysis, conceive of it as categorized, nominal, absolute—a factor of deductive logic. But then just as a picture of the moon can introduce us to themoon, and just as its reflection in water can orient us toward its presence in the sky, so toowe may connect to basic pure presence by applying the logic of the four extremes. Throughthe view of deductive logic practiced for a long time with correct reasoning, gradually weunderstand that the moon’s reflection in water is illusion, an understanding that eliminatesthe extreme notion that it exists. Second, it removes the extreme notion of its nonexistence.Third, it removes the extreme notion of both its existence and nonexistence, and then fourth,it removes the extreme notion of its neither existing nor not-existing. Gradually, havingremoved the four extreme notions and free at last of conceptual elaboration, we can enter"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"into the mind of buddha. This is not the same as the direct approach of Dzogchen.On the sutric path, pure presence is not mentioned as existent, now, in the minds ofsentient beings, except as the seed of buddha. If pure presence is taught as manifest here andnow in the minds of sentient beings, then, due to the inadequacies of the sutric view, theresult is the accumulation of the negative karma of wrong view. In the sutric tradition, whenthe bodhisattva Manjushri taught the twenty different kinds of emptiness, many sravakas’heads burst open, and some died vomiting blood. In Dzogchen, right from the beginning, allelements of experience are introduced as pure presence. This pure presence is primordiallyfree of conceptual elaboration and is the contemplation of the minds of all the buddhas.Putting any effort into purifying it or adulterating it by concepts tends to conceal its natureand is counterproductive. We need to abandon all effort, along with deductive reasoningand speculative concepts, and for this, first, we need to receive instruction from a lama.Applying his instruction, we will understand that there is no other possible way.If we have single-pointed devotion to the idea of the lama as buddha, and we seek theinstructions that induce the vision of the pure presence of Dzogchen, the rigzin-lamaskillfully introduces pure presence to us through signs, words, experiences, and so forth.For instance, Lama Tsangpa Drubchen introduced pure presence to Kyilkhor Rinpochewhile they were herding yaks. The lama gave his student personal instructions on Dzogchenall day long, and then as the evening drew in, when lama and student were sitting on a rock,all of a sudden the lama shouted “Move back!” and Kyilkhor Rinpoche pushed himselfbodily back on the rock. “No! No! Not like that!” whispered the lama, and understandingthat pure presence should be distinguished from dualistic perception, he experienced nakedpure presence clearly. “Today we have killed the real enemy, which is grasping,” said thelama happily. “Now go to a place of deep seclusion, perfect the practice, and accomplishbuddha in this lifetime.”Here is a similar story. Before Drubwang Pema Dewai Gyelpo met Dudjom Lingpa,because he retained a little attachment to the accomplishment that he had gained from hispractice, he thought of displaying it to the lama. Immediately upon meeting him, the lamacaught Drubwang by the throat and slipped his knife up and down in its sheath with his righthand so that Drubwang could hear what he was doing, and asked him loudly to tell him hisrealization. Instantly Drubwang’s sense of accomplishment vanished, and he clearly sawnaked pure presence.The way accomplished lamas give introduction is unpredictable. Sometimes it is giventhrough discursive teaching, and sometimes it is given playfully. There are many ways ofintroducing pure presence. Longchenpa in his commentary upon The Treasury of theDharmadhatu, describes the introduction to pure presence as either without words or byone of six different contrived methods. Check out those details!In short, putting aside the lower path’s deductive reasoning and rational fabrications, weshould rely solely upon introduction to the view as the naked experience of pure presencethat is the natural state of mind. To facilitate that, first we need to establish all ourexperience of samsara and nirvana as baseless and rootless subjective envisionment. Then,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"without modifying the immediate awareness of our original condition, we can be introducedto the ground of being that is without dualistic perception and that is primordially pure andfree of any conceptual elaboration. This introduction is not a part of the Approach withSigns and is also absent in the lower tantra approaches. It is the unique special supremeDzogchen teaching.This is the way that the famous fourth Dzogchen Rinpoche, Mingyur Namkhai Dorje, wasintroduced to the view that led to his attainment of the consummate level of reality, higherthan the sky. At the age of twenty-five, he sought full ordination and studied all the fivefields of cultural knowledge. Then he began to administer his 280 monasteries, and hissanctity and knowledge spread far and wide. In order to seek empowerments,transmissions, and explanations, he went with fifty monk attendants to Dokhok to see DoDrubchen Jigme Trinle Woser, who was a heart-son of the rigzin Jigme Lingpa. When hemet Do Drubchen, the lama gave him a skull cup full of pure alcohol and told him to drinkit. As an ordained bhikshu, he was forbidden to drink alcohol, but ordered by the lama toimbibe, he had no choice, and without hesitation he consumed it in a single draft. Instantly,he was intoxicated. When he returned to his entourage, some high lamas and tulkus werecritical of his drinking alcohol, but they thought that, after all, it was only a temporarylapse. When they found that Rinpoche was still not sober the next day, they were surprised,and even more surprised when they realized that, through that single skull cup of alcohol,Rinpoche was to be intoxicated for the rest of his life. He saw all the phenomena ofsamsara and nirvana and the path from one to the other as magical illusory envisionmentand mental projection. Sometimes when he was called from his room, he simply walkedinto the wall, showing the front half of his body on the outside wall. This was seen by manypeople. He had unlimited psychic powers, had no attachment whatsoever to theappearances of this world, and had gone beyond to the Dzogchen place where reality isconsummate.When rigzin-lama and fortunate disciple meet, an understanding of the nature of things isnot left to deductive logic but is experienced as pure presence itself. That is the supremeuniqueness of this path. The omniscient Jigme Lingpa said in The Chariot of Omniscience,“To accomplish pure presence as dharmakaya, there is nothing to prove. Here is effortlesstransference into the great primal awareness that is ultimate freedom.”The accomplishment cannot be attained by reason. It is inexpressible and cannot bepresented logically. In Ascertaining the Three Vows, Ngari Panchen says, Only through the blessing of the rigzin-lama!Any other method is ignorance! Like a finger pointing at the moon, the method is symbolic. We cannot define the methodexactly, as in Do Drubchen’s introducing Mingyur Namkha Dorje to pure presence.The teaching of Dzogchen and the character of a rigzin-lama are beyond definition. Ascan be inferred from the examples above, do not presume that a significant encounter can bemet with easily. Such lamas are as rare as a blue moon. The disciple must be super sharp in"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"mind and have a strong karmic link with the lama. Just like an astrologer’s student whointuits the key points of reckoning and has no need to compute each and every calculation,there is no use in making a disciple strive long and hard when simply by being shown themethod he or she can easily and quickly become an expert. Consider someone who mayhave forgotten a past conversation but with a single simple reminder recollects it clearly.Likewise, through a lama’s precept or by means of a single sign or symbol, we can recallpure presence and verify it. That is known as “the path of clear light” or “pure presence asprocess.” Resting loosely in this pure presence, we will gain confidence, and signs ofaccomplishment will appear gradually or instantaneously. Finally, the basic pure presencethat is unconditioned and pure presence as process mingle into one another, like a childnestling into the lap of its mother.1.38 THE POTENTIAL OF PURE BEING AND PRIMAL AWARENESS IS ALREADY MANIFEST IN BASICPURE PRESENCE All the visions of samsara and nirvana are present in the space of pure presence. If we donot manifest the potential that resides in the ground, path, and fruition of intrinsic presence,it is like having an audience with the king but remaining ignorant of his palace, subjects,wealth, power, and fame. Thereby we will underestimate his power at the very momentwhen it is vital to know it. We may know the essence of intrinsic awareness, but what of theessence of pure presence, the three dimensions of being, and the five modes of awareness?Is it necessary to strive to accomplish what was apparently absent before, or do thoseaspects arise spontaneously? Of course they arise spontaneously! In primal awareness theground, path, and fruition, and view, meditation, and conduct are all, already, primordiallycomplete. If we are searching for manifest buddha-potential somewhere else, it is likehaving a lake in front of us and looking for some water behind us, or like keeping anelephant in its stable and searching for her footprints in the jungle.Basic pure presence is the source of all the buddhas of past, present, and future, thetreasury of pure being and primal awareness, and the chariot to traverse the path and thestages: it is a grand mansion replete with uncountable entryways to fully manifest buddha-potential. In this primal awareness, the buddhas’ dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, andnirmanakaya are timelessly and unconditionally accomplished. If we look into the obverseside of pure presence, its essence, free of all conceptual elaboration, is the dharmakaya; itsnature, unmodified and unadulterated clear light, is the sambhogakaya; and its expression ofcompassion, uncrystallizing and unconfined, is the nirmanakaya. To take the crystal as anillustration: its transparency is its aspect of emptiness, the dharmakaya; its radiance is itsaspect of clarity, the sambhogakaya; and, as the basis of the appearance of anuncrystallizing multiplicity, it is the nirmanakaya.In the tantra The Supreme Source it is said, In my all-creating bodhi-nature"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"As effortless spontaneity,Lies the heart of buddha, the trikaya:My uncontrived nature, the dharmakaya,My uncontrived essence, the sambhogakaya,My manifest compassion, the nirmanakaya.These three are not to be discovered as results,Rather, they are me, the creator himself,Myself as whatever appears, all phenomena,My nature, essence, compassion unmodified,Since as reality I show the three dimensions of being. And further, The five dimensions are my envisionmentWith pure-lands, and reality is completed.1.39 DISPELLING DOUBT ABOUT THE UNCONDITIONED POTENTIALITY OF PURE PRESENCE When we say, “The three dimensions of being and fivefold awareness are intrinsically andspontaneously completed in the spaciousness of pure presence,” narrow-minded peoplewho are biased against Dzogchen teaching and like to denigrate it say, “It is absurd tosuggest that we ordinary sentient beings possess the pure being and primal awareness of thebuddhas.” This denigration is like saying that, when it is covered by a thick cloud, the sundoes not exist. We fortunate people, engaged in Dzogchen, do not argue with such fools, norshould we be intimidated by such talk. If the potential for buddha is not already there, if theawareness of pure presence is not actually incipient, when in the future we become buddha,how can it possibly manifest?I n The Supreme Tantra, Lord Maitreya says, “Unconditioned and spontaneouslymanifest.” In The Secret Core, it is said, In the causal Approach with Signs,Sentient beings are taken as the basis of buddha;In the resultant, tantric approach,Mind’s nature becomes familiar as buddha. And in the Hevajra Tantra, it is said, All sentient beings are buddhaYet covered by adventitious filth;Clean the filth and buddha actually appears."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"With knowledge of that affirmation from the definitive transmission, we must agree thatbuddha-potential is not manifest without the purification of adventitious impurities. Clearly,we need to remove the clouds that cover the face of the sun before the rays of the sun willshine upon us.However, the manifest buddha-potential that is the five buddha-families is completedperfectly in the primal awareness of intrinsic presence. Akshobhya Vajra represents thedimension of pure presence that remains unchanging and unchangeable in all appearances.Amitabha represents the dimension of pure presence that is immutable in time and spaceand that has no center or circumference. Vairochana represents the dimension of radiance inthe utterly immaculate all-embracing, all-suffusing spaciousness, free of conceptualelaboration. Ratnasambhava represents the wish-fulfilling dimension of supreme andordinary accomplishment attained through nothing existent, yet everywhere apparent.Amoghasiddhi represents the dimension where all-embracing buddha activity isaccomplished effortlessly and primordially. These five buddha-family dimensions cannotbe separated from the creativity of the primal awareness of pure presence. Similarly,considering a single ritual from the oral or revealed teaching, right from the refuge prayerto the final auspicious prayer, one pure presence is complete. If we need to know thetwenty-one unadulterated potentialities and so forth, all the potential fulfilled, we canbrowse through the texts of Longchenpa and The Intrinsic Nature of Being of DudjomRinpoche and so forth.If we wonder whether intrinsic presence and buddha-nature are mentioned in the sutrasof the Approach with Signs besides the supreme tantra, the answer is “Yes!” In The King ofSamadhi Sutra, it is said, “Buddha-nature embraces all beings,” while the GandavyuhaSutra says, Although in the mundane worldEverything conceivable may burn,The sky will not perishNor will intrinsic awareness. This point of great profundity, the nature of mind as pure presence, should be kept secretfrom unworthy recipients, just as a mother refuses her breast to an infant who needsmedicine. The sutra Awareness of the Moment of Death provides this story:“O Noble sons! said the Buddha. There was once a woman with a sick child in greatpain, and she called a doctor who put solid medicine into the child’s mouth, telling themother not to give milk until the medicine had dissolved. To deter the infant from herbreasts, she smeared some bad-smelling ointment on them, at the same time telling the babyboy that it was poison and he should not suckle. Then, when the infant was thirsty, hebegged for milk; but when he tried to suckle, the bad smell deterred him, and he cried. Afterthe medicine had dissolved, the mother washed her breasts and offered them to the infant todrink. But thinking that there was poison on the breasts, the child would not drink. Then shetold the infant that before, when he tried to suckle, the medicine had not dissolved and that"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"she was afraid that he might die if he mixed her milk with it. Now, however, that themedicine had dissolved, he could drink. And the infant slowly suckled the milk.“Noble sons! In order to tame the disciples’ minds, just as the doctor gave the sick childmedicine to dissolve in its mouth, so I gave them meditation instruction only on theegolessness of the body-mind. This mellowed the worldly view of the bhikshus bydemonstrating three things: the superiority of the authentic world beyond, the falsity of theworldly ego, and that through familiarization with egolessness, the body is purified.“Bhikshus, you must meditate on selflessness! Thereby you will abandon clinging to aself or an ego. When such clinging is abandoned completely, you will attain nirvana! Likethe mother smearing bad-smelling ointment on her breasts, I instruct you to meditate on allphenomena as insubstantial, without self. Like the mother washing away the smell andtelling her son that earlier, when the medicine had not yet dissolved, she could not let himsuckle, but now he could drink, so too in order to divert the mind of the world into theteaching, I taught absence of self. But now I teach the existence of buddha-nature. Bhikshus!Don’t be afraid, like the infant, but rather, like the infant after he had examined her breasts,drink the milk! You, bhikshus, should now assume that we all possess buddha-nature, and,after investigating it, meditate upon it and cultivate it with diligence.”Buddha-nature is not something that is newly generated through cause and effect, for it isspontaneously present in all sentient beings. The potential of pure being and primalawareness likewise does not need to be conscientiously generated, for it arises naturally,just as heat arises from fire and light from the sun.The paths of sutra and tantra are similar in realization, but different in method. Accordingto the sutras, to attain buddha, even brilliant individuals need to accumulate merit for threecountless eons. Those tantrikas who believe themselves on the path of primal awarenessand those on the path of the inner and outer yoga-tantra may accomplish buddha in sixteenor seven lifetimes, or in a minimum of three lifetimes. But from the point of view ofDzogchen, such yogins and yoginis are not really on the path of primal awareness becausetheir views are not yet free of subtle apprehending marks, not yet released from time, andtheir meditation is still sullied by subtle goals that inhibit their encounter with the naturalface of the dharmakaya. For these reasons, they cannot transcend the meditation. They mayrealize that their conduct is like a reflection in water, but since it contains the snake-knotsof judgmentalism, such conduct cannot remove those deficiencies. In the view of theDzogchen yogins and yoginis of Cutting Through and Direct Crossing, through whichbuddha is gained in one lifetime, they have not gone beyond the path of the intellect.The nature of Dzogchen is such that nothing arising in consciousness is rejected, nothingis accepted, and everything is treated impartially. Whatever is perceived, nothing at all isdone to it; thereby all experience whatsoever is known as nondual. Here, all views havebeen utterly forsaken and completely released in the matrix of luminous mind, self-arisenprimal awareness. Unmoving from that space we remain in nonconceptual meditation. Thepropensities of rejection or acceptance are intrinsically released and what is called“ultimate, decisive conduct” arises, which, in short, is free from any focus, elaboration, or"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"effort.1.40 HOW TO MAKE THE FIVE POISONS INTO THE PATH ITSELF Turning the five poisons into the path is the actual path of primal awareness. The manner ofengagement is not to reject desire, anger, sloth, pride, jealousy, and so on, but rather tonurture the five poisons as reflexively released pure presence.Recall and relive the harm that an enemy has previously inflicted upon us, such asstealing from us, injuring us, or embarrassing and shaming us, and let hatred toward himrise intensely from the heart. As that hatred arises, look deeply into it and see where—notwhy but where—it comes from, where it resides (in the upper or lower part of the body, forexample), and, finally, where it goes. Look whether the hatred has color and shape, andwhat that color or shape may be. When you see it is as primordially empty, selflessenvisionment, do not abandon it because it becomes mirrorlike awareness.Imagine being with an attractive lover, drinking wine and eating meat, wearing designerclothes and jewels; imagine wanting to ride horses or travel in cars and aircraft and allowdesire to arise. When desire arises, gaze at it nakedly, looking at where it comes from, inwhich part of the body it resides, and, finally, where it goes. See whether it has color andshape, and, if so, what are those colors and shapes, and so on. When you see it withdetachment as primordially empty envisionment, do not abandon it because it becomesdiscriminating awareness.When we are sleepy, in decline, in a state of dullness, gloom, and depression—in short,when mind is not clear but is imperceptive and bewildered, like a frozen computer—letsloth arise. As it arises, gaze at it carefully: look at the owner of the sloth, see where itcomes from, in which part of the body it resides, and, finally, where it goes. See whether ithas color or shape or any attributes at all. When seen with detachment as primordiallyempty envisionment, if we do not abandon it, it becomes awareness of vast spaciousness.Then think of race, status, wealth, bone structure, powers of voice, and so forth, and letpride arise. When pride has arisen, gaze at the pride-holder nakedly: see where it comesfrom, in which part of the body it resides, and, finally, where it goes. See whether it hascolor, shape, or any other attribute. When we see that it is primordially empty self-envisionment, do not abandon it, and it becomes awareness of sameness.Think of someone whose wealth, knowledge, fame, privilege, opportunity, and so forth,is greater than ours. Let our jealousy of him or her grow. When jealousy has arisen, justlook at it fixedly, look at the owner of the jealousy, where does it come from, where does itpresently reside in the body, and, finally, where does it go. See whether it has color, shape,or attribute. When we see that it is primordially empty envisionment, if we do not abandonit, it becomes the all-accomplishing awareness.If we can realize the nature of the emotions, they become the various modes ofawareness. On the flip side of the errant thoughts that arise with emotion we discoverempty awareness, and what a joy that is! If we search for it, however, we cannot find it, and"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"we become pathetically hopeless. We must first understand that all the five emotionalpoisons are baseless, rootless, and empty. Later, knowing this, when we are engaged on thepath, during the gaps between sessions of meditation, no matter what thoughts and emotionsarise, we remain at ease with them, without any need to examine their nature, origin, placeof abiding, or place of departure, or to examine their shape, color, or attribute: the emotionsand accompanying thoughts will effortlessly disappear by themselves.In this meditation, both the introduction of the view and the maturation of meditation arecompleted. For beginners on the Dzogchen path, this sequence of examination, fixation, andestablishment and of introduction and maturation is very profound. Later, no matter whatemotional poison emerges, we can automatically recognize its nature as it arises andreleases simultaneously, again and again. Then in our own experience, we can clearly seethe inexpressible pure presence as the dharmakaya. There is no higher view or meditationthan this. In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, View and meditation are primordially released,Liberated in nondiscrimination;Conduct and character are primordially released,Liberated in the All-Good;The goal is primordially released,Liberated in the absence of hope and fear. When Padmasambhava left Tibet for the island of Ngayab Ling in the southwest, the king,ministers, and people of Tibet saw him off on a Gungtang hill top. They prostrated to himand wailing with grief requested him not to go to Ngayab but to stay with them, to be theobject of prayer of the king, ministers, and people. He left them anyway saying, “Allexperience is ephemeral, and it is natural that all composite things eventually decay. I havebeen here long enough, and there is no place in Tibet that I have not visited and blessed.Yeshe Tsogyel and Bairotsana are staying behind, and they are not different from me. In themountains, cliffs, and remote places of Tibet, I have hidden treasure texts for the benefit offortunate people of the future.” Having relieved the sorrow of the people in this way,before leaving he sang this song: I go to the land of mirrorlike awareness,And in those fields of the land of clear lightThere will be no hatred for enemies,Just pure presence and spaciousness inseparable,United like mother and son. I go to the land of awareness of sameness . . . and so on, through the five modes of awareness.In this last instruction given by Padmasambhava to his disciples, to Dzogchen yogins and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"yoginis, the morning and evening sessions of ritual meditation sitting in the seven-pointposture of Vairochana are implied. Body, speech, and mind should not wander into triflingplaces. In short, yogins and yoginis should not go beyond the norms of the view, such as themanner of sleeping, eating, walking, speaking, sitting, thinking, and so forth.The land that Padmasambhava goes to is the land of the five modes of awareness of allbuddhas. He goes to the place of the unchangeable mind of mirrorlike awareness, wherethere is no hatred for enemies because anger is reflexively released. In that clear lightspace, the mother of basic pure presence and the child of the pure presence as process areunited, and right there is the primordial dharmakaya lord Samantabhadra. It is veryimportant to know the manner of recognition of the five poisons as the five modes ofawareness. Singing this song, Padmasambhava departed from Tibet, riding his horse KingBalhati through the sky to Ngayab Ling.Abiding in unmodified pure presence, these are the twenty-five aspects of the ultimateresult according to Longchenpa’s The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu: The reason that everything is perfect by simply letting it beResides in the incorrigible master that is fivefold pristine awareness—Physical, energetic, mental, qualitative, and active perfection, each fivefold—And this is the original buddha, the spontaneity of the vast primordial matrix.Do not search elsewhere—buddha is already accomplished right here! Since the essence of pure presence is unchangeable, it is the fivefold body of buddha: thechangeless vajrakaya, the manifest bodhikaya, the dharmakaya, the sambhogakaya, and thenirmanakaya. Since the essence of pure presence is inexpressible, it is the fivefold buddhaspeech: the speech of bodhi-reality, the speech inseparable from the vajra, the speech ofunborn meaning, the speech of meaningful symbol, and verbal speech. Since the essence ofpure presence is free of conceptual elaboration, it is the fivefold buddha mind: the mind ofintrinsic awareness, mind of mirrorlike awareness, mind of awareness of sameness, mindof discriminating awareness, and mind of bodhi-accomplishing awareness. Since theessence of pure presence accomplishes the nine wishes to completion, it possesses themanifest fivefold buddha-potential: it is the ground of every perfection and, moreparticularly, is the throne of the noble ones, pure and clear light, the boundless mansion,and a pure-land. Since the four perfectly appropriate activities are accomplished in thesame purity as primal awareness in the essence of pure presence, immaculate realitycontains five buddhaactivities: pacification, enrichment, control, destruction, andspontaneity.As the basis of all potential in intrinsic presence, every potentiality matures andmanifests immediately, the external world expands, beings in the world multiply, andenjoyment of the five sensory pleasures increases. All these are like the envisionment of amagician’s horses, elephants, and so forth, apparent yet not truly existent, an indisputablevision of emptiness free of all extremes.To reveal that vision we need to have confidence in meditation. If we lack such"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"confidence, we will not be able to remove the veil of dualistic delusion. What we call“meditation” is nothing but a confident view, keeping pure presence fixed leisurely withinthat view. When we have gained confidence in meditation, all the phenomena of samsara,nirvana, and the path from one to the other arise as forms of emptiness, apparent yet nottruly existent. Those forms are the path, and traversing it there is neither hatred of an enemynor love for a friend, neither hope for nirvana nor fear of samsara. Moreover, when ourpotential for such meditation is realized, both samsara and nirvana are bound together in theone cosmic seed, free of all conceptual elaboration, and whatever we have specified,focused on, imagined, referenced, or elaborated will gradually vanish, like mist dissipatingin the sky. The meditation will become increasingly unchanging, the view of dharmakaya asempty pure presence will be revealed, and with this the obscurations of semen, ovum, andenergy flows (that is, basic gender dualism), which are very fine dualisms of karmicpropensity, are abandoned: here, it is as if dust, haze, and darkness were eliminated fromthe summer sky. And we arrive at the place where all experience is consummate and allintellection exhausted.In The Chariot of Omniscience, Jigme Lingpa quotes this verse: The yogin freed, like the sun rising at dawn,The dharmakaya appears. Wah! Wah! The body dissolves into its quantum-level constitution; mind vanishes into dharmakaya andbuddha!"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"1.41 UNTIL DISCURSIVE THOUGHT DISSOLVES IN SPACIOUSNESS, KARMIC REPERCUSSIONSMUST BE CONSIDERED Until our pure presence is a constant, until we attain fearless confidence, we must attend tokarmic causality, vows and samayas, accumulation of merit, abstention from vice, and soforth. As Padmasambhava famously said, quoted in The Chronicles of Padmasambhava,which were revealed by Orgyen Lingpa, My view is higher than the sky;My karma is finer than barley flour. Pay attention to karmically effected events with the same care we reserve for protection ofthe eyes. But at the same time, such events should not be seen as real and true. Quoted inThe Samye Chronicles, Padmasambhava again says, Maharaj! In my tantra it is the view that leads; but don’t let your conduct bend towardthe view. If you do let it stray, you take the black demonic sophistic view that mayjustify any wicked action by “emptiness.” But on the other hand, don’t let the viewtend toward conduct because if you do, trapped by notions of concrete materialism andspecific attributes, the occasion for liberation will never arise. Due to his misconception of karmic cause and effect, Tarpa Nakpo was born in hell andthen reborn as Rudra. For further details of this story, browse through the tantra TheDiscourse of the General Assembly. Tarpa Nakpo’s fate was determined by his contemptfor karmic repercussion in his confusion about the causal process. As Jowoje Atisha said inThe Lamp of the Path, Until concepts are exhausted, there is karma;Believe in the repercussions of karma!1.42 THE BENEFITS OF HEARING DZOGCHEN PRECEPTS Dzogchen yogins and yoginis appear to be normal ordinary people, but inwardly their mindis buddha. In The Tantra of Perfect Creativity, it is said, Whoever abides in nonaction,Even though he has a demon’s body,His mind is buddha. If we can walk the Dzogchen path, we can gain enormous merit. We have received a humanbody, which is very rarely obtained. We have encountered a rigzin-lama, which is a very"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"rare occurrence. We have met the Dzogchen teaching, which is extremely fortunate. It is asif a blind beggar found a jewel in the garbage. For countless lifetimes, we have wasted ourtime in trifling matters, yet this present human body has not emerged from nowhere withoutcauses and conditions. It was obtained because of the accumulation of merit in previouslives. In this present form, we have met with a rigzin-lama, and we can hear, reflect, andmeditate upon Dzogchen. This good fortune is greater than rebirth as Indra, king of the gods,or as Brahma, greater than rebirth as a celebrity millionaire, or an iconic Americanpresident, like John F. Kennedy, or a famous Nobel laureate, like Nelson Mandela.Compared to rebirth as a Dzogchen yogin, such destinies are nothing. Whatever wealthwe possess, however famous we may be in this world, in the end it is all suffering becausesamsara is marked by change, and change implies suffering. In this way, our every activityis suffused with it. If we but observe and consider, we will become convinced of this. Ofthe sickness and disease of body and mind that we endure—we will not speak of that. Eventhe fame and wealth that we take to be happiness lasts only for a very short time. Due tostrong emotional affliction, some dominate others in competition. No matter how muchwealth we possess, we anxiously want more, worried by enemies and thieves andprovoked by the suffering of failing to reach the status of richer people. In heaven, forexample, after spending a life span of five hundred years enjoying the pleasures of thesenses in every manner possible, a god knows, through his power of foreknowledge, aweek before his death, when he will die, what manner of death he will endure, and how hewill suffer in his next life. It is said that his suffering will be one hundred times greater thanthe pleasure he enjoyed in heaven. The more possessions or fame we have, the more wewill suffer. That is a fact.To repeat what Sri Saraha sang, Contentment is the ultimate wealth;Detachment is the final happiness. Supreme happiness and pleasure is contentment and freedom from attachment. Contentmentis a certain degree of satisfaction. The freedom from attachment implies knowing thatwhatever appears to exist is unstable, unpredictable, and untrue and that all things are mereconceptual labels and mental delusion. To realize these two, there is no better method thandependence upon the Dzogchen view and meditation. To accomplish Dzogchen, in thebeginning, we should approach it through reason to attain a logical view; in the middle, weshould practice meditation; and, at the end, we accomplish the result. All three phases—beginning, middle, and end—are important. At the beginning, even though we cannoteliminate the inclination to gain fame, amass wealth, subdue enemies, and care for friends,we should reject these inclinations as much as possible. In the middle phase, in an isolatedplace, if at all possible, or in a quiet room without disturbance by traffic or radio, try tomeditate morning and evening. In the final stage, we reach the level of Dzogchen called “allreality consummate.”If we cannot attain the vision all at once, we need to familiarize ourselves gradually with"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Dzogchen view and meditation. This will be beneficial in this life and also in the next life,and we will eventually become free from samsaric wandering.In this present age of raw competition in business and trade, even though we might not beable to train frequently, as our time schedule allows, we should remember to sit down dailyfor meditation. Whatever anxiety we incur, due to sickness, conflict, aggression, or loss ofprofit, and so on, through the power of this training we will not become so attached toexternal objects: thereby suffering is alleviated. The more the mind is concentrated, thefewer mistakes will occur in any task. There is no better advice than this to benefit this lifeand the next.As Longchenpa says in his Collected Fragments, At the beginning, let go of worldly concerns;In the middle, retreat to a place of seclusion;At the end, arrive at consummation.This advice is favorable to this life and the next."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"2. Meditation as the Path 2.1 FIRST, CONVICTION IN THE VIEW IS ESSENTIAL WE RECEIVE INSTRUCTION from a rigzin-lama. Then, with experience of the essence of theempty pure presence of the dharmakaya, which is the view free of all conceptuallimitations, immaculate and certain conviction naturally arises. We cultivate and deepenthis by training in meditation. If we lack experience in the Dzogchen view, if we lackrealization of our own nature, then conduct will not be perfect, and no matter how mucheffort we apply, it will only make us tired. The measure of conviction is indicated in thisanecdote about Dzogchen Shenga Rinpoche, who, when asked by a disciple, “What aboutthe view, Uncle?” replied, “My view? If Guru Rinpoche came in the door right now, I’dsay, ‘Welcome! How are you?’ That shows the view!” Shenga Rinpoche meant nodisrespect; he meant rather that only personal experience provides complete assurance inthe Dzogchen view. Similarly, Sri Saraha sang, In front, behind, in the ten directions,In whatever is seen, there lies the suchness;Today the lord in me has eradicated delusion.I never need ask anything of anyone again! Saraha says that he has now gained certainty in the reality of all experience of samsara andnirvana, free of conceptual limitations. With absolute certitude, meditation and conduct willemerge effortlessly from the view. In his Beacon of Certainty, Ju Mipham says, What is the perfect way of being?Certitude in seeing!Conviction in the viewFacilitates conduct and meditation. Meditation is nothing more than sustaining the essence of the view, and the view, asmentioned earlier, is direct awareness of appearances or consciousness that does notcrystallize into this or that. Pure presence itself does not slip into the object, and allpositive and negative attachments vanish by themselves into the spaciousness of thedharmadhatu. That is not the method of the Approach with Signs, wherein each object isneutralized separately with an antidote."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"2.2 THE REASON FOR MEDITATION If the view itself is meditation, what need do we have for meditation? The perfected viewbecomes perfect meditation only in an ideal world. After introduction to the view, until theview has entered the matrix of the here and now or until we attain confidence in it, we needto meditate. Dudjom Rinpoche quotes Longchenpa, in The Dakini’s Heart-Essence, saying, We may realize the timelessly liberating view, but if we are not constant in meditationin that view, it is not possible to turn back the delusory appearances of samsara. It isvital to familiarize ourselves with the natural state of pure presence. In the actual praxis of Dzogchen, view, meditation, and conduct are not distinct. In TheThree Incisive Precepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, “View, meditation, and action are not to bedistinguished.” That is true, but for the student on the graduated path, the view, meditation,conduct, and result should be taught separately. So long as we are plagued by dualisticconcepts, like the viewer of a painting who sees in three dimensions what the artist hadpainted in two, we must distinguish between view and meditation. For this reason, yoginsand yoginis should strive in their meditation in a secluded place.Now I will explain the meditation that is required at that time. Ordinary meditation—mundane meditation—is the basis and practice of all religions. But with regard toDzogchen meditation, it is impossible to talk about it without having experienced it—itwould be like trying to talk about delicious food without ever having tasted it. We mayhave received excellent instruction, but without an understanding gained in habitualDzogchen meditation such instruction is of no use. When someone is suffering from severesickness and the doctor, instead of giving medicine, gives a long story about the medicine—how it is made, what it’s composed of—we will know that he is a learned doctor. Butunless the medicine is given to the sick person and heals him, the story about the medicineis a joke. Unless we actually meditate, the stories of this and that teaching are of no usewhen we face the suffering of death, the bardo, and rebirth. So meditation practice isessential. Meditation means familiarization with mind. In Sanskrit it is called dhyana, thetechnical meaning of which is to focus the mind on one locus without distraction from anyother, so that attention rests on a single point. If we think that Dzogchen meditation isperformed in the rational mind and for that reason cannot go beyond that mind, we make thefalse assumption that meditation is performed by anything or anyone at all.In general we distinguish three types of meditation: first, the concentration that is like achild’s play; second, the concentration that thoroughly differentiates meanings; and third,the concentration that is the prerogative of the tathagatas. The children’s meditation is whatmany religions talk about these days, the type of concentration that Buddhists regard as thecause of birth in the formless realms of the gods. Meditation on selflessness as practiced bythe lower Buddhist approaches [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] for the purpose ofliberation is known as the concentration that thoroughly differentiates meanings. Themeditation upon the selflessness of all experience free of conceptual elaboration practiced"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"by bodhisattvas for the purpose of attaining buddha is the concentration that is the virtue ofthe tathagatas. More on this topic is contained in other texts, so I will stop writing about ithere.2.3 DISPOSITION OF MEDITATION Let me now give a Dzogchen pith instruction, or secret precept: the method of maintainingthe view is called “meditation.” When we are convinced that all experience of phenomenais apparent yet not truly existent, like magical illusion, then as each separate emotion arises,it is free of the need of a separate dose of emptiness as an antidote because neither theaffliction nor the antidote have ever existed. Whatever appears, however, should remainloosely in perception just as it is; sustaining that disposition is called “meditation.”If someone asks, “Why in Dzogchen is meditation called ‘nonmeditation’?” the answercomes that all phenomena are seen as space. But how can we “hold” space as an object offocus? Space has no specific characteristic, so there is nothing to meditate upon. The natureof mind is primordially unborn and free of any conceptual elaboration, so nothing can arisethere upon which to meditate. Here no effort is made to distinguish any difference betweenthe object of meditation and the mind that is meditating—what difference could be foundsince there is no meditation and no one who meditates? This disposition of mind in itsnatural state is called “nonmeditation” in Dzogchen.What is the meaning of “in its natural state”? When mind is disturbed by thoughts, itsnature is unclear in the same way that a pail of dirty water is unclear after it has beenstirred: the bottom of the pail is then imperceptible. When mind is kept unmodified in itsnatural state, like a pellucid pail of undisturbed water, the nature of mind is pure presence.As the reality or “suchness” of all phenomena is ascertained in the view, there is now noneed of any scrutiny or investigation of the nature of mind, and therefore simply to abide inthe natural state of whatever appears is labeled “meditation.” This nonmeditation that is themeditational disposition of Dzogchen is the crux of practice. When we stay innonmeditation without drifting away, all the points of reference of our internal discussionvanish, and the bright pure presence of self-arising primal awareness dawns spontaneously.Some may say that this is a mind-constructed meditation because it does not go beyondmental experience. But the temporal mind of the ordinary being who is the meditator is notthe meditating mind—the “meditator” is self-arising primal awareness free of allconceptual elaboration. Even though the ear-sense is engaged and mind perceives sound,this sound is in itself an utterly unelaborated empty echo; likewise, even though inmeditation it is the mind that is engaged, this meditation is free of all elaboration.But, then, on the other hand, as Ju Mipham says in his Reply to Refutation, The inexpressible nature of being is experienced and understood as a mere generalidea by ordinary beings who possess conviction. In the sutras it is called “the patiencethat is in total accord with buddha-dharma in experience.” In the tantras it is called"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"“illustrative primal awareness.” In reality, in short, it is the mind that is in accord withthe ultimate absolute. With certainty in unelaborated reality, meditating on the gradual path, ordinary beginnersfirst produce a subtle realization consonant with reality and finally unite with the realprimal awareness, or the natural state of unelaborated reality. As the great Rongzompasays, that type of meditation is conventional meditation. If we appear to be meditating wellbut cannot get any direct experience, the fine view that gives no result is like a child who atbirth has neither friends to care for him nor enemies to hate him. Until he becomes older, heneeds to be nurtured with food, clothing, education, and so forth. If he is not cared for, hewill die immediately. Depending upon his nurture, the boy will mature. Likewise,according to the quality of the meditation based on a fine view, the result will be good,medium, or bad.Some claim that they practice Dzogchen, but when happiness and suffering arise in them,the requisite equanimity does not arise. That is the fault of lack of familiarity with the view.If we can practice the view continuously for months and years, like a perennially flowingriver, eventually no matter what situation arises, like joy, misery, or fear, it just vanishes,released immediately upon its arising. We will experience every situation vanishing as itarises, and an ineffable sense of pleasure, clarity, and brightness will manifest, along witha powerful inner certainty that transcends negative and positive. Even when we are dying,we will feel no regret. Such are the accomplishments of a little meditation. Even if we haveonly confidence in the view, we will be free of fear in life and death.Until we are able to abide from the first moment in the view and maintain equanimity inthe flow, in the second moment dualistic thoughts will arise, and suffering and fear willfollow us continuously. Whatever happiness or suffering arises, we should have theconfidence of liberation right in the moment, and the key point here is to hang loose in thatmoment of release. If this is lacking, then the meditation is ineffective. It is very importantthat we sustain our nonmeditation until we get strong and unchangeable pure presence. If wepractice at the juncture of unification of view and meditation, we will not find suffering,fear, or any untoward situation even if we were to look for it.Longchenpa says in The Treasury of Natural Perfection, We may recognize the nature of mind,But if we do not familiarize ourselves with it,It is like having an infant son kidnapped. In the first moment, we may recognize the nature of mind as indicated in the view, but if welack sound experiential familiarity with it, in the second moment the enemy “dualisticthought” will steal away the mind. We will then suffer just as we would suffer if our infantson, left unattended on a battlefield, were to be kidnapped by the enemy and mercilesslytortured. If we have been introduced to the view and cannot meditate properly, no benefit isgained. Rather than reading many books on Dzogchen, it is better to do a single session of"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"meditation. Meditation must thus be emphasized. Just like a great musician who, thoughable to mesmerize a large audience, gets no joy from it, if those who read or hear theteaching do not realize it, they will get no benefit in this or the next life. Just as a greatcruise liner may take many people across the ocean but itself can never land on the othershore, so those who teach Dzogchen to others but have no experience of meditation willremain as ordinary people. Just as the sight and sound of water does not quench our thirst,so teaching without meditation is unfulfilling. Just because we have heard and understoodinnumerable expositions of the profound teaching does not mean we have yet reached theplace of reflexive liberation.“Meditation practice” means, primarily, familiarizing oneself with the view. Whateverwe do, whether good or bad, if we have practiced it diligently, we can do it withoutdifficulty. At the Olympic Games, for example, we can see amazing things done by athletesin the high jump and in gymnastics. These great feats are due to constant practice. Likewise,if we can train the mind, we can master it in rest and in movement. This mind training iscalled “meditation.” All beauty and ugliness and all happiness and sadness are justproducts of mind. It is vital to train the mind!2.4. WITHOUT MEDITATION, EVEN TRIVIAL EVENTS CREATE SEVERE SUFFERING Whatever our misfortune, serious or trivial, we should include all personal misery in theprocess of our meditation. We tend to fall under the influence of pain and suffering—we letthem push us around. Consider the pain derived from losing our business, the sadness ofdivorce, the pain of lost opportunities or that of lost status. Think of the anxiety when welive in fear of violence from enemies, of our worry about disobedient children, or simplywhenever things fail to happen in accord with our desire. If we encounter suffering, we mayseek relief in the use of alcohol or drugs, or we may engage in gambling to forget it. Suchescapism is like pouring cold water into boiling water while it is still on the stove—thoughit immediately cools the pot down, unless we turn down the heat, the entire thing will returnto the boil. An antidote may give us some small relief, but more suffering is always aroundthe corner. What we think of as a solution can often become the cause of a greater problem.A hare trapped inside a net struggles to free herself, but the more she struggles, the tightershe draws the net, until finally she is sufficiently desperate to gnaw off her own limbs. Themore we think about a solution, often the worse the problem becomes.Once when a flock of geese was flying through the sky, at one particular place the leaderwarned them all to be quiet because of the danger of hunters. One goose told another gooseand that goose told a third goose and soon the entire flock was repeating the warning. Thenoise was heard all over the area where the hunters waited, and they were able to shootdown many of the geese. So, childlike people bring suffering upon themselves by trying toeliminate it. Yet however much we try to forget it, suffering rears its head again. When wecannot sleep at night and we think that we are thinking too much, the more we think like that,the longer we lie awake! This “thinking of not thinking” itself is the gross thought that keeps"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"us awake. Likewise, ordinary beings are unskillful in their treatment of suffering, andwishing to change suffering into happiness, they take to alcohol and become mad, orperhaps commit suicide to get rid of their suffering.In May 21, 2007, in the Nepal daily newspaper Kantipur a headline read, “After KillingHis Lover He Killed Himself.” The story went like this. Pukar and Prabina were lovers.Pukar’s love for Prabina was so strong that he could not live without her. They were bothwell educated, and Pukar had recently graduated from a hotel-management course afterstudying for a year and a half in Singapore. When he returned to Nepal, he obtained a goodjob in a foreign business and also a visa for Canada. But the girl’s parents objected to heraffair with Pukar, so they married her off to a man in the nearby city of Pokhara. WhenPukar heard of this marriage, he was distraught and bewildered. He phoned Prabina andtold her that since they lacked the karma to be together, there was no point in stayingfriends. He wanted his letters and gifts returned and suggested a place that they could meet—the Salagiri forest. He had something to share with her, he said. She agreed to meet himand keep the assignation secret. Pukar was so depressed that he got drunk while waiting forher in the forest, and in his distress decided that if his beloved could not belong to him thatshe should not belong to anyone else. When she arrived, he took her by the neck, then shotand killed her. Then, driven by fear, he ran some three kilometers away from that place andshot himself to death.If we examine these lovers’ emotions carefully, we cannot find them anywhere since theyare not based anywhere in particular. Consider a dream in which your only son suffers fromsickness, receives treatment, the treatment fails, and he dies. In this situation, immenseemotional pain arises for you, the parent. If you take the illusion of the dream as true andcling to it, you will suffer. To save yourself from such fear and suffering, you have to knowa dream as a dream or awaken from your sleep. When you are awake, the sufferingdisappears from the bed. In the same way, if you experience such suffering in love affairs, itis because you regard illusions as truly existing.How can there be suffering in delusion? We all feel what arises in us just now as realsuffering, and we make the same mistake in the dream. Consider Pel Dorje, a man wholives inYangkar, which is close to my monastery. After finishing his work one day, hereturned to his house, ate dinner, and before his family had finished their food, lay down bythe hearth and slept. Suddenly he woke up, shouted that rocks were falling, and ran outside.His father and two sisters tried to catch him but failed, and he ran twenty feet to a fearful pitfull of rocks and nettles, and without hesitation, jumped into it. The people pulled him outstill alive. Later, when we asked him what had happened, he said that he had mistaken hisdream for waking experience. The fear and anxiety of dream can be more intense thanwaking experience. Pel Dorje’s family still lives in fear that the same thing might occur tohim again. If we speak from the perspective of the dharma, we could say that his disease isa strong attachment to dualistic appearances—even dream appearances—as substantial andtrue.When chicken-hearted people travel at dusk through a place known to be infested with"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"snakes and catch a glimpse of a short length of rope on the road, they may become verynervous, believing that the rope is a snake, and may even think they see it move. Due totheir strong tendency to believe in the substantiality of appearances, they make mistakes inperception and are deluded. After September 11, when terrorists attacked the World TradeCenter in New York, many Americans were not able to forget it, and the incident remainedin their memories for months upon months. Many were plagued by insomnia because of thisincapacity to let it go. Whenever they heard the sound of planes or vehicles with a loudnoise, remembering 9/11, they became apprehensive. Similarly, in Pakistan, after sufferinga strong earthquake, people talked quietly for many months because loud sounds triggeredtheir fears of a repetition of the earthquake. When they heard loud noises, they clung to eachother. This behavior is due to the strong imprint of traumatic incidents upon the mind. Wesentient beings are attached to traumatic events not only in the present but throughoutbeginningless samsara. This attachment cannot be abandoned easily. But, as in the case ofillness, no matter how serious it is, if we encounter a good doctor who prescribes effectivemedicine, gradually we can recover. Likewise, if we meet a rigzin-lama who can guide uswith the profound teaching of Dzogchen, in a short time our attachment to dualistic delusionas substantial and true will dissolve. Day by day delusion will vanish, and intrinsicawareness will become clearer and clearer to us. Finally, delusion vanishes entirely, andwe attain buddha in pure presence.So whether it is daytime or nighttime, we need to realize that suffering arises onlybecause we cling to delusion as reality. If we can understand that what we cling to as truthis actually delusion, without an atom of substantiality, that it is self-envisioned illusion, wecan thoroughly excise the notion that there is an objective field of suffering “out there” anda subject who suffers “in here.” Through this understanding, we can relax, and, in thespaciousness of pure presence, where there is no way to conceptualize a place of suffering,we can increase our confidence.A few years ago, in the area around Koltri in Nepal, there was a great famine. A manlived there with his wife and five children amid the severe suffering of near-starvation. Theman, trying to save his family, felt enormous responsibility for them. After a few weeks,unable to earn enough to feed them, he went to another place in order to work and to earnmoney. He worked hard in his new job, and, after some weeks, set out for his homecarrying thirty kilos of rice; but the rice was stolen as he slept during the night. He wasutterly distraught when he woke up the next morning and found the rice gone. He was sodistraught that he bought some poison, and when he reached home, he told his family thatthey were going to feast that night. He cooked rice gruel and put the poison in it and gave abowl of it to each of them; finally, he drank a bowl himself. All seven of them died. He hadbelieved that the best way of avoiding suffering was to poison himself and his family. Theman had no bad intention, but he was simply supremely unskillful. Had he moved to asuitable place, he might have been able to beg for food and save the lives of his family.From the president down to the lowest person on the street, we can all make such mistakes.We can all cite examples of events designed to eliminate suffering that actually multiplied"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"them. Such unskillful people are seen by the noble ones as the real fools among fools.2.5 MEDITATION REMOVES THE ATTACHMENT THAT IS THE ROOT OF SUFFERING If we want to counteract suffering in this life, in the bardo, and in the next life, there is nobetter way—in fact, no other way—than the path of Shakyamuni Buddha. Buddha taughtmany methods—Theravada, Mahayana, outer tantra, and inner tantra—to remove suffering.Here we are looking at Dzogchen, where what is to be abandoned and what is to beadopted are identical in the one taste of pure cognition. In the Approach with Signs, eachparticular emotion has its own antidote: the antidote to desire is meditation on disgust, forexample, while the antidote to hatred is meditation on loving-kindness, the antidote to slothis breathing meditation, and so on. But in Dzogchen, whatever fear or suffering occurs,whatever arises in mind, is known as subjective envisionment because not a single atomanywhere has any substantial existence. For that reason, the meditation precept “hangloosely in pure presence” takes precedence. The implication of “hanging loosely” is thatbecause appearances are not blocked or rejected in any way in the nature of mind, theobjective field is allowed to appear just as it is. Hanging loosely in pure presence, free ofobjectified appearances, and abiding such that the very complexion of our experience istransformed—this is meditation. Prolonged, it is excellent meditation.Some think that during actual meditation, appearances, being delusion, should bestopped. They can, however, only be impeded, not stopped. Just as a dam constructedacross a river for generating power brings destruction to the environment, so it is withappearances. We should not obstruct appearances at all because they are the creativity ofpure presence and the doorway to primal awareness. If they are obstructed, later, whenbuddha could be attained, primal awareness as a multiplicity has no basis out of which toarise.If we cannot stay relaxed in pure presence for any length of time, we should instead doshort sessions of meditation repeatedly. Now do not think that “meditation” is merelyfollowing Vairochana’s seven points; just this is not meditation at all and refers only to theoptimal bodily posture that supports meditation. On the other hand, if we think correctbodily posture is not necessary, we are mistaken. “Short sessions of meditation” does notmean sitting in the posture and then releasing the posture again and again, or sitting and thenrising from the posture repeatedly. The meaning is that in one session, sitting in the postureof the seven points of Vairochana, we should let the mind hang loosely. When stormythoughts arise and obstruct our meditation, we should recall the original view of purepresence that is free of conceptual elaboration. Thus our meditation consists of sometimesbeing aware of the mind’s digressions and sometimes resting in its nature, alternately, oraccording to our necessity. Through repetition of this process, the meditation isstrengthened, and we can abide in pure presence for a longer time each day. If we can restin pure presence, we no longer need to watch the mind, as that phase of practice has beencompleted."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Through such meditation, no matter what kind of suffering arises, the experience is likemeeting an old acquaintance in the middle of the market place. Whatever painful thoughtsarise, in their very appearing, they are known through familiarization to be baseless androotless, and thus left alone, they arise and just vanish by themselves. So no matter howgreat the suffering, when we experience it in the timeless moment of pure presence, it turnsinto happiness. We have no need to confirm this with anyone else, for we experience itourselves. Further, we should look into the nature of mind not just when we suffer but alsowhen we are very happy. When happiness is seen as a concrete thing, then attachmentgradually increases, and in this way, in turn it becomes the root of suffering.2.6. THE CAUSE OF MANIFEST SUFFERING IS HOPE AND FEAR Hope for fame, wealth, and pleasure, and fear of robbers, thieves, and disease—this is ourlot as ordinary beings. So long as there is hope of happiness or fear of pain, suffering is noteliminated. We accumulate wealth for our own benefit in this life and look for fame, health,and so forth. We are always attached to these things, and if we already possess them, we tryto hold on to them. If we do not possess them, we are constantly thinking about how toobtain them, scheming and plotting. When we have what we want, we fear losing it, so withlots of hard work we protect it and in the process risk offending others.Consider the Mahabharata epic of the Hindus. This story is so long that it can benarrated for months on end. It is one of the longest and best stories in the world, containingboth worldly and religious advice. It provides moral instruction and advice on manners,respect for elders and spouses, and on the raising of children. It gives very good advicebased on truth. In short it is the story of a conflict between truth and falsehood, where thetruth is reality and falsehood is delusion. It shows how to win such a war, and since thewar is waged on behalf of reality, it is a virtuous war. Attachment to reality—the nature ofmind—is noble attachment, but in buddha-dharma, it is taught that the root of suffering isattachment. Whether the Mahabharata shows noble attachment to the body and primalawareness of reality, or the ignoble attachment of subduing enemies and cherishing kith andkin, the truth is that both are attachments and hence the very root of suffering.As it is said in the Avatamsaka Sutra, Wherever an objective is reified,It becomes a bone of contention for demons. So long as there is an objective to focus upon or become attached to, there can never be anyattainment of the happiness of liberation. This has been emphasized in the sutras andtantras. In the war of the Mahabharata, attachment to truth and dharma caused the death ofmany thousands of people, both kings and subjects. In the Vinaya of Bhagawan Buddha, it issaid,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Whatever doctrine creates desire directly or indirectly cannot become the cause offreedom from desire. Know that such a doctrine is not the Buddha’s teaching, nor hisdiscipline, nor his exposition. Whatever we may call it, if it is an attachment, it does not go beyond the circle of suffering.If it is a pure event, on the other hand, it will benefit both self and others. Take compassion,for instance, which brings benefit to all beings and is the root of peace and the heart ofbuddha: if we have attachment to it and assert any kind of control, such compassion willcertainly neither provide much benefit to the world nor become a support for the attainmentof buddha. Like gift-wrapped dog vomit, it is outwardly attractive but inwardly utterlyrevolting. It is important that compassion not be stained by attachment.In Entry into the Middle Way, Chandrakirti says, Compassionate mind, nondual perception,And luminous mind create bodhisattvas. Objectless compassion inseparable from insight into emptiness is attainment of thebodhisattva level. When compassion is tainted by attachment, it cannot become a supportfor the realization of buddha. Attachment to one’s nation, country, fellow citizens, and soon, inevitably leads to perennial sufferings in this life and the next.It is vital to train in nonattachment. In the Vinaya, the Bhagawan Buddha says, If any person in anger destroys or burns a symbol of my mind such as a stupa, a symbolof my speech such as a scripture, a symbol of my body such as a temple, in that eventno disciple of mine should fight that person or abuse him or protect those things withanger. And in Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Shantideva says, Don’t show anger to thoseWho destroy images, stupas, or scriptures,As they are not harming the Buddha or anyone else. Any happiness there is in the world ultimately turns to pain. Why? Consider the twosides of a coin: just because what we desire is to be seen on the front does not mean thatdislike won’t soon appear on the back. Likewise, hope and fear are a single coin, one entitywith two faces—on the other side of a moment in which we hope for more happiness willbe our fear of more suffering. Until attachment is eliminated, we can be certain of havingboth hope and fear. As long as there is hope and fear, the delusions of samsara will beperpetuated and there will be constant suffering. Thus attachment is the nature of both hopeand fear: looking at the ultimate emptiness of the self-envisioned magical illusion of hopeand fear, we should hang loosely in the flow."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"It is not enough merely to look into the space of happiness or sadness; it is important tohave pure presence constant in that flow. If the power of meditation is not constant, it isimpossible to remain long in the place of nondual perception. Thoughts that ariseintermittently will break the continuity, and radiating out from this, like ripples on a pond,the poisonous taste of emotion will arise to obstruct the meditation. As gross thoughtsincrease, ripples become rough waves that intensify the emotion. Until subtle emotions areleft behind, we cannot eradicate suffering, so it is crucially important to sustain the state ofmeditation. When we gain strong familiarity by staying in that space for a long time, then nomatter what thoughts arise, whether gross or subtle, they will not be able to dislodge us:upon recognizing the first thought, whatever thought it may be, in that very moment, werealize it to be the play of the spontaneous creativity of dharmakaya. Like a wave fallingback into the ocean, the thought vanishes into the dharmakaya. In that space of naked emptypure presence that is the view, always cherishing thoughts of the five poisonous emotionsand all the movements of body, speech, and mind, and the acts of eating, sleeping, moving,and sitting, we are known as the yogins and yoginis who stand guard over the shiftingdharmakaya display. This is the supreme method of sustaining the essence of meditation.According to Dzogchen teaching, this is unadulterated by any kind of focus; it is called “thegreat meditation that is nonmeditation.”2.7 A SHORT EXPLANATION OF HOW TO SUSTAIN THE PRIMAL AWARENESS OF INTRINSICPRESENCE In his Wish-Fulfilling Treasury, Longchenpa says, Sit cross-legged upon a comfortable cushion, take refuge, and generate acompassionate attitude. Then, when the mind focuses loosely on any single perception,without any idea in mind, without any thought, distraction free, radiant and shining,abide there without concentration or diffusion for an instant. Without externalizing anyobject or thinking any thought, material objects and the immaterial grasping mind arenow no longer dualized. The mind that meditates is neither affirming nor negating;what is in front of the mind is said to be absent, for there is nothing established there.Each separate nonreferential perception is equal in the immaculate primal awarenessof intrinsic presence.During informal contemplation between meditation sessions, recognize appearancesas apparent yet nonexistent, like magical illusion, and perform dedication andaspiration prayers for the sake of the six illusory classes of sentient beings, all ofwhom have been our parents. During informal contemplation between sessions,without even a whit of desire, attachment, or clinging to the illusory appearances ofthis life, perform prostration and circumambulation, read texts, make tsatsa [clayimages], water offerings, and so on."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"2.8 THE PLACE OF MEDITATION The place of meditation is solitary. Physically, we should retire to a secluded place, awayfrom entertaining distractions, and mentally, we should be in a place free of discursivethought. Physical seclusion implies an isolated place free of the mundane affairs andfrivolous entertainment of the big city, free of the pollution and roar of traffic and people. Inthe city, there is no time to rest, and we are wafted along like a piece of paper driven by thewind; time goes so fast that we have no time even to sit and eat comfortably. Thedissatisfaction generated in the city is caused by attachment to external objects. So, likeearlier generations of yogins, in Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Shantideva says, Desire brings sadness;Joy arises in seclusion.Conflict and emotion are absentIn quiet forests glades;In blessed moonlight in a cool sandal forest,With a beautiful simple retreat house,The forest trees silently tossing their heads,Sweet breezes blow to benefit others. We need somewhere free of people and traffic, with some flowers growing round about,streams bubbling by, a spacious view, and a pond nearby, perhaps a place withsandalwood trees, birds flying freely, and animals roaming leisurely. From time to time thesound of musical instruments like flutes, lutes, and guitars may be heard. A cave on top of amountain or in its lap, preferably a natural cave, is best. If this ideal place of seclusion isimpossible to find, go to a place where there is no chance of attachment to friends or hatredtoward enemies, where there is no noise from neighbors, dogs, vehicles, or anything else,and no disturbance to our meditation from frivolous activities. If we find such a place thatsupports our practice, accomplishment will arise much more easily; if our practice isuninterrupted, we will attain true accomplishment. Such a place is difficult to find thesedays. Everyone is busy pursuing happiness in external, material things. If it is impossible togo into secluded retreat, just leave work aside for one hour in the morning or evening whenthere is no noise and devote it to a daily meditation practice.Beginners will not gain any advantage if external conditions are not supportive. Themind will be distracted and diverted in a second. Like a stampeding horse in a marketplace, the mind runs to frivolity and noise and cannot stay still for a moment, and there canbe no meditation. So practice calmly in a secluded place and meditate well. Gradually wewill be able to assimilate more and more noise until finally when our meditation is perfect,we can sit in any noisy environment and be like Jetsun Milarepa, who sings in hisSongbook, When I move in a crowded market place,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"No matter what appears, I look at the nature of mind;When I stay all alone,I rest in naked empty pure presence. When in a crowd, whatever subtle or gross emotion arises, our attention needs to beinstantaneous in recognition of it, just as it arises, so that it can be integrated into the matrixof meditation. In that way whatever appears is absorbed into meditation, and there is noneed to search for isolation and seclusion. But for beginners, it is best if they find solitudein a forest, or if not there at least in a quiet room where they can meditate morning andevening.The main supports to accomplishment of samadhi are freedom from entertainment andfreedom from discursive thoughts: these freedoms are best optimized in a place of solitude.As Longchenpa says in his Collected Fragments, Mountains covered with forests are a pleasure,And in valleys of herbs and flowers with waterfalls,May I transcend the activities of this lifetimeAnd attain supreme liberation.2.9 THE DISPOSITION OF THE BODY First, take a comfortable seat, sit cross-legged, hands in meditation posture, spine straightlike an arrow, shoulders held back like a vulture’s wings, neck slightly hooked, tongue heldagainst the palate, and eyes dropped to the nose. If we can apply these seven instructions ofVairochana in our meditation, then with a straight spine our energy channels becomestraight. If the energy channels are straight, then the movements of energy within the bodyare quieted, and with energy pacified, the mind is luminescent.2.10 HOW TO SUSTAIN PURE PRESENCE IN BRIEF The pure presence that was introduced in the section on view is itself the meditation.Wherever a single perception falls, let it hang loosely but firmly, without modifying it inany way, and it rests in naked empty pure presence. If we are unable to abide in this due tothe sudden arising of thought, we should just hang loosely in the thought. Then thatcreativity, like a wave falling back into the ocean, is released into its ground, and thusbuddha is attained in alpha-purity. We should engage diligently and one-pointedly in thispractice until we become confident, and then, our creativity optimized, we attain constancy.2.11 HOW TO SUSTAIN PURE PRESENCE IN GENERAL"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" Generally speaking, in both the sutrayana and tantrayana, accomplishment on any pathdepends upon shamata meditation. Whether on the common path of supersensory awarenessand miracles, the uncommon path of emptiness and compassion, the development andcompletion stages of visualization and recitation, and channels, energy, and seed-essence,or the path of the two phases of Dzogchen—all rely on shamata.Shantideva says in Entering the Bodhisattva Way, Knowing that shamata subsumes vipasyana,Emotional afflictions are completely eliminated.First, seek shamata. In Applying the Mahayana Method, Rongzompa says, For those who are unable to remain in the natural state that is the great perfection, weteach the mode of striving. Even though they practice that graduated, progressivemode, their view is still based in Dzogchen. Dzogchen is the ultimate teaching, as it heals all the diseases that afflict us. On the manypaths that require effort, the highway to liberation teaches the concentration that includesthe eight volitional antidotes that alleviate the five faults, which I discuss next.2.12 THE FIVE FAULTS THAT HINDER CONCENTRATION The five faults that hinder concentration are laziness, forgetfulness of instruction, sinkingand agitation, failing to apply antidotes, and overintensive application of antidotes. Laziness: When it is time to meditate, we feel tired in body and mind and decide toprocrastinate. The dualistic mind that always lingers on external objects fools us by its verystructure. Meditation contradicts its purpose, so when meditation comes to mind, lethargy isthe response. Lack of interest in meditation is laziness. Forgetting the instructions: When we cannot remember the instructions about posture, andshamata and vipasyana that were taught by the lama, we are at a loss as to how to meditate.This is forgetting the instructions, and together with laziness, it obstructs meditation at theoutset. Sinking and agitation: These two obstruct meditation in its process. “Sinking” means thatthe mind is losing energy and feeling sleepy and dull because it is engulfed by themurkiness of consciousness. “Agitation” describes that state in which the mind, like adrifting feather, will not stay in the place where we put it."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Failing to apply antidotes: If we forget to apply the antidotes to sinking and agitation andfall under their influence, we cannot engage in concentration. Overintensive application of antidotes: Here, even though the mind is free of sinking andagitation and we remain in concentration, the antidote is now applied too intensively andconcentration is obscured. Among these five the first two, laziness and forgetting the instructions, obstruct engagementof concentration at the outset. Sinking and agitation are obstructions in the process. Failureto recall antidotes and repetitive recalling of the method are obstructions that preventdevelopment of concentration. These five faults should be abandoned.2.13 THE EIGHT VOLITIONAL ANTIDOTES TO THE FIVE FAULTS The eight antidotes are faith, aspiration, effort, pliancy, recollection, attention, motivation,and equanimity. Faith implies trust; aspiration is the will to strive; effort is exertion;pliancy is mental flexibility: these four are the antidotes to laziness. To induceconcentration, trusting faith creates aspiration and will; with effort, pliancy is attained, andlaziness is overcome. The fifth, recollection, overcomes forgetfulness. The sixth, attention,which can be thought of as inner concentration, is an antidote to sinking and agitation. Theseventh, motivation, can also overcome sinking and agitation, in this case by the applicationof intentionality and volition. The eighth, equanimity, alleviates sinking and agitation byeffortlessly preventing the composition of thought.Avoiding the five faults and depending upon the eight antidotes, we train the creativity ofshamata. If creativity is not trained, even the most brilliant mind in the realm of aspirationcannot produce a supreme single-minded wish. In order to generate that aspiration, we needto train our mind in the nine stages of mental stillness. These nine stages are resting,continual resting, repeated resting, fully resting, taming, pacifying, fully pacifying, one-pointedness, and settling in equanimity. By hearing the instruction on the disposition ofmind, the faults that obstruct concentration disappear and the qualities that facilitate it—faith and aspiration—naturally arise.Intense effort in concentration and so on gets rid of the five faults. Thereafter, no matterwhat object is envisaged, whether in the development or completion phase—or even in theempty pure presence of the dharmakaya—resting within that object is the first stage, whichis called “resting.”When the mind will not stay still even for an instant, moving around like lightning, usemental constructs to create effort and persevere in the training. The ability to sustainfixation upon the object of previous focus is the second stage, “continual resting.”Beginners will face difficulty maintaining continuity during practice of these first twomethods, so keep in the stream through alertness and vigilance. When mind wavers andmoves like a shooting star, distracted elsewhere from the object of focus, remember to"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"guide it repeatedly, like guiding a jet of water. This is “repeated resting,” the third stage.As recollection grows stronger than previously, just abiding in the object before us,regardless of how clear it is, mind will become a little more stable. Then, throughincreasing one-pointedness, mind focuses on the object alone. This is “fully resting,” thefourth stage.Out of that concentration, some conceptual elaboration will naturally arise, and like abee that does not stay long in one flower, drinking nectar quickly and moving on, we cangain motivation and inspiration in that process, and those movements of thought thatpreviously were intolerable now fall under control. This is “taming,” the fifth stage.Now, while abiding in the object with attentiveness, we find that sinking and agitationmay arise. By the application to each of its own specific antidote, the various thoughts willvanish into themselves, assuaged. If indeed we can achieve that, the faults of sinking andagitation will vanish, like the sediment in a limpid pool of water once it has been left tosettle. This is the sixth stage, “pacifying,” which is like a person who is relaxed andattentive in a state of equanimity.Then as thought diminishes, a little concentration increases, and the emotions generatedby the thoughts are cleared, just as muddy water clears when the mud settles. Distractionsno longer occurring, the mind is “fully pacified.” This is the seventh stage.Through exertion, progress is faster, and now, effortlessly, conceptual obstacles nolonger arise, and we rest in one-pointed focus. This is “volition” or “one-pointedness,” theeighth stage.With that volition there is no need of effort in order to progress exponentially, and weachieve “equanimity” automatically. This is the ninth stage, and it is also known as the“single-pointed aspiration of the realm of desire,” which is achieved by familiarizationwith all of the nine stages.2.14 IN UNITARY SHAMATA AND VIPASYANA, THE NINE MENTAL STATES AND THE FIVEMYSTICAL EXPERIENCES ARE CORRELATED Whether we wish to meditate through inseparable shamata and vipasyana in the ultimateDzogchen manner, or whether we seek the five supersensory powers and temporaryhappiness in the realms of the gods or men, first, in order to become fit for the task, weneed to cultivate the mind, just as we need to cultivate a field to prepare it for crops. If wetrain in shamata at the beginning, we prepare for the pure presence of Dzogchen. The well-known Dudjom Pure Vision training (Dudjom nangjang), in which the syllable “A” is fixedupon, is a preliminary shamata practice for Dzogchen. As the great Rongzompa says inApplying the Mahayana Method, For those who are unable to remain in the natural state that is the great perfection, weteach the mode of striving. Even though they practice that graduated, progressivemode, their view is still based in Dzogchen. Since the great bliss of the luminous mind"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"is the root of all experience, it has the power to cure every sickness that afflicts us. As it is said in the tantra Meditation upon the Luminous Mind, Founded in Kuntuzangmo, everything is necessarily virtue; all Kuntuzangpo’sbehavior, even devilish conduct, thus ultimately vanishes. Thus all action founded inKuntuzangmo, even devilish action, is bodhisattva action.There are many methods of changing the mind provided by the paramitas and theyoga-tantras, such as the concentrated absorption free of the six faults that removes theten veils on the path of liberation; the samadhi of the eight impulsions that voids thefive faults, which is also on the path of liberation; the technique of aggregates[skandha], elements [dhatu], and sensory fields [ayatana], and the concentration ofgrasping, establishing, stopping, opening up, and eliminating that is also on the path ofliberation; the concentrated absorption of recitation that prevails over the sixobstacles that are difficult to overcome and is also on the path of liberation; and thesamadhi of visualization of body, mind, and deity that is also on the path of liberation.There are so many methods of concentrated absorption like that. Here we stay with the Dzogchen view, meditating on shamata and vipasyana combined withthe nine stages of the resting mind, and the order of appearance of the nine stages of theresting mind is correlated with the five mystical experiences.At any rate, when we practice shamata, the five mystical experiences—fluctuation,attainment, familiarization, continuity, and completion—appear one after the other. Theexperience of fluctuation is like a high waterfall; the experience of attainment is like acataract in a narrow valley; the experience of familiarization is like the river flowingsedately across a plain; the experience of continuity is like a gentle breeze blowing over asmall lake; the experience of completion is like an ocean free from waves. We need tocontinue with shamata meditation until these five mystical experiences have occurred.Furthermore, when we practice the single-pointed meditation of the aspiring mind, if thenine stages of resting mind and the appearance of the five mystical experiences arecorrelated, they arise in the following way. During the first three dispositions, whilemeditating on the stages of resting, continual resting, and repeated resting, strong thoughtsarise like a high waterfall. Many bright thoughts arise here, seemingly more than before thestart of meditation practice, but that is a delusion because earlier, the thoughts were notexamined, recalled, or focused upon, and for that reason alone, we were not aware of them.During meditation according to shamata instruction, however, we actually become aware ofsuch thoughts, and it seems therefore that there are more of them. Through this ongoingrecognition, thoughts will gradually become clearer and eventually will disappear. Whenthoughts arise and are not recognized, it is like what happened to Chonga the fool.Once Chonga, the idiot, was lost, and he did not return to his house until a month later.The people asked him where he had gone. He replied that some Khampa traders had takenhim to Lhasa. Everyone believed him. One day a man asked him what he had seen in Lhasa."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"He replied that he did not know exactly, but that Grandfather Jamyang was there.Grandfather Jamyang, however, lived near Mount Kailash, so the people assumed that hehad been to Mount Kailash.Chonga had seen thousands of people, but he had not registered his perceptions. It wasnot that he had not had the perceptions. In premeditation experience, although thoughts ariseuninterruptedly, they are unexamined and unnoticed and hence do not rise to the level ofconsciousness, as in the case of Chonga the fool on his tour. Now, by virtue of themeditation precepts, the thoughts that arise are recognized, and their nature is understood,so that slowly, through meditation, they will disappear.During the fourth disposition, fully resting, and the fifth, taming, what earlier were grossthoughts become more pacific, like a cataract in a narrow valley. There is the continuity ofmany subtle thoughts here, many busy whirls and swirls of thought, becoming more dense. Itis understood that the falls in a cramped gorge are slower than high falls.The experiences of the sixth disposition, pacification, and the seventh, thoroughpacification, are like a broad river running across a plain. From far away, it appears thatthe river is not moving. When we get closer, we can see its slow, dignified progress.Likewise, from above, we may think the mind is resting, but looking more closely, we cansee many subtle fluctuations. At this time, the crux is to apply increased effort.During the eighth disposition, one-pointedness, the experience of firmness is like a freshbreeze over a small lake, the mind abiding in the object of focus, and—if effort is sufficient—abiding continuously. This is attentiveness. Like a stone dropped into a pond makingripples in concentric circles that eventually become imperceptible, in this experience, therising of thought becomes so subtle that we do not quite catch it, even though we are payingattention.During the ninth disposition, at attainment and resting in equanimity, we gain theexperience of completion, which is like a mountain, unmoving and unyielding. If that type ofsingle-pointed aspiring mind is accomplished, the mind becomes effortlessly familiarized.All the stages are accomplished automatically, and if the mind is kept without thought in itsown place and all appearances cease, we have the experience of mind mixed with space.Later, desire and anger and other emotions become reduced and finally vanish altogether.Experiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thought arise, and even sleep seems to be mixed withconcentration, and most dreams seem pure.If the nine dispositions of mind and familiarization with the five experiences arecompleted outside the Dzogchen context, then we do not go beyond the worldly path. It isbest first to develop perfect shamata and then find Dzogchen. A good field will yield agood harvest, no matter what we sow.After accomplishing this single-pointed mind, if we then train in the development andcompletion stages, we can easily accomplish both. Moreover, whether we enter theDzogchen path of Cutting Through to alpha-purity or Direct Crossing in spontaneity, we areblessed with supreme good fortune.Consider Polo Khen Rinpoche, the emanation of the rigzin Garab Dorje, who practiced a"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"shamata retreat for three years. Afterward he trained in Dzogchen and accomplished aunique result, as has been told to me personally by my lama Khen Rinpoche Dawai Wozer.He reiterated that neophytes should practice shamata if they wish to accomplish theDzogchen teaching.Furthermore in the tantra The Secret Core: Illusory Display, it is said, A mad elephant-like mind,Tamed into equipoise,Then following tantra, mantra, and mudra,Achieves a miraculous accomplishment.2.15 THE SIMPLE, QUINTESSENTIAL DISPOSITION People who are not interested in elaborate methods or who are unable to practice them canuse this instruction from The Super-Refined Oral Precepts of Pema Lingpa, which iseminently portable and extremely potent in its blessings. Then the Dakini Yeshe Tsogyel requested her master Padmasambhava to give hersimple instructions that condense the teaching into a single precept that is easy topractice. The Guru replied, “Listen, you beautiful, devoted, and joyful being! Thereare all kinds of instructions on posture, but just sit relaxed and at ease—that’s the mainpoint. There are many precepts concerning speech and energy, like binding the breathand reciting mantras, but just stay silent like a mute—that’s the main thing. There aremany key points of mind to follow, like fixating the mind, relaxing, radiating andabsorbing light, concentrating, and many more, but just stay free and easy withouttrying to change anything, just resting naturally—that’s the main thing. Let the body rest like a corpse, without movement; keep silent like a mute; leave the mindalone without changing anything. Leave pure presence alone, unmodified, just as it is.Relax, at ease, and hang loosely in the natural state.That is the best disposition of body, speech, and mind. There is simply no better methodthan that, and anyway it is a simplification of what has been explained in detail in previoussections. People today are more happy and competent in this type of disposition. Whatevermay be our practice, however, whether short or extensive, to completely understand theDzogchen view is the crux.In The Words of My Perfect Teacher, it is said, Meditation without instruction—Climbing a rock without fingers! Seek an introduction to the Dzogchen view from a rigzin-lama and consider it well. Then"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"enter meditation—that is the crux.2.16 THE METHOD OF PRACTICING THE ESSENTIAL PURE PRESENCE IN SESSIONS There is no view other than what has been explained above in the section on view. Duringthe time of actual meditation in seclusion or in a quiet room, sit upon a comfortable cushionin the ideal body position. Then recite the refuge prayer and aspiration to a compassionateattitude like this: In the supreme Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha,I take refuge until I attain enlightenment;May I achieve buddha for all sentient beingsThrough the merit of generosity and other virtues. Here we need heartfelt faith in the three jewels—Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha—and weshould repeat the refuge verses three times. Then, with the intention of attaining buddha notjust for ourselves but for all sentient beings everywhere, all of whom have been our parentsat some juncture, we generate a compassionate attitude. Then we should visualize the rootguru in the form of Padmasambhava seated in front of us, and while in a state of deepdevotion induced by his blessing of mind bestowed on us and all sentient beings, recite thefollowing prayer three or seven times: HUNG! On the northwest border of Orgyen,Born in the pollen bed of a lotus flower,With miraculous supreme accomplishment,You are known as Padmasambhava, the lotus-born:Surrounded by a retinue of dakinis,We follow after you,Please come here to bless us.GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUNG. After reciting the Seven-Line Prayer, repeat the mantra OM AH HUNG VAJRA GURUPADMA SIDDHI HUNG one hundred or three hundred times. Finally, we receive theblessing of the guru’s body, speech, and mind by means of rays of white, red, and blue lightflowing from the syllables OM AH HUNG in his three secret places to our own. Then theguru melts into light and dissolves into us, and his mind becomes inseparable from ourown, like water being poured into water. In that space, without modification, in a relaxedmanner, sustain the view. Alternatively, at this time we can pray to our guru andPadmasambhava as one, letting the mind stay easy and relaxed, looking at the luminosity ofpure presence. Then, when a thought suddenly arises, we can use either method, and relaxinto it, just as it is. With neither affirmation nor rejection, whatever arises in the objective"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"field or as a thought form does not crystallize, is not pursued, and is left unmodified. It isnaked pure presence, shining and vivid, with neither projection nor absorption; thus,slowly, pure presence recognizes itself, and we rest in the stillness of the stream of it.Again, when thought arises, look into its very essence as before and let it rest in itsnatural state, without accepting or rejecting it as good or bad, without desire or aversion,and so forth. Do not follow thought or suppress it like ordinary worldly people, or likemonks of the lower approaches who count it a sin if the thought is not cut or transformed ina meditative process. Do nothing whatsoever, abiding in the natural state.When we sustain that practice for a long time—days, months, or years—gradually purepresence becomes a natural constant. External conditions cannot change it, and whateverthought arises does so as meditation and dissolves into itself. Then we come to have anatural trust in our meditation. We have no need to consult others because meditation comesautomatically, and we know instinctively with total assurance that there is no other buddhathan that.At the end of the meditation session, we dedicate our merit to all sentient beings andmake wish-fulfilling prayers. To all below the great Kunzang Dorje Chang,To all above our own gracious gurus,Whatever is requested by sentient beings,May I accomplish that all myself. And we recite, Through this merit, seeing all like buddha,And thereby overcoming error and fault;Roiled by the waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death,Let all beings be released from the ocean of existence. By embracing the three excellences (excellence of engagement with the generation of acompassionate attitude, excellence of the nonreferential main practice, and excellence ofsubsequent dedication), engaging in meditation in the morning and evening or during retreat,the merit will prove highly efficacious.Quoting Longchenpa in The Dakini’s Heart-Essence, Dudjom Rinpoche says, Not so much meditation but rather familiarization;If familiarization becomes the matrix, it is supreme meditation. With constant meditation, one day meditation becomes the matrix. Insofar as there isnothing to meditate upon, and there cannot be any wavering from it even for an instant,nonmeditation is the ultimate meditation.In The Words of My Perfect Teacher, Patrul Rinpoche quotes Guru Padmasambhava as"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"saying, Buddha through meditation is the common path;Buddha through nonmeditation is unique to me. If we practice accordingly, we hit the target.2.17 THE PLACE OF DEVIATION INTO MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE Mystical experiences are actual signs of meditation and its power. Mystical experiencesfollow from meditation just as smoke follows fire and shoots follow the germinating barleyseed. When we rest loosely in the wonderful, naturally occurring pure presence, ourawareness of the here and now is not as it was previously; bliss, clarity, and no-thoughtarise together with pure presence. If we do not abandon the identification of naked purepresence with mystical experience, then pure presence will always arise with attachment tobliss, clarity, and no-thought, and our meditation will never go beyond the three mundaneworlds.In the tantra The Source of Sacred Samadhi, it is said, Meditation may be stable,But if there is attachment to it,It is like a child’s enjoyment,And it will not accomplish nirvana. While we are bound to the mystical experiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thought, there canbe no understanding of naked reality. However, under the influence of meditation, theseexperiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thought will gradually and surely arise. The reason fortheir arising is that basic intrinsic presence is the empty essence of the dharmakaya, thenatural clarity of the sambhogakaya, and the all-pervading compassion of the nirmanakaya.Pure presence is our own natural perfection.In our ignorance, delusion appears as a stain on the ground of being [alaya], on theground consciousness [alaya-vijnana], and on ordinary consciousness [vijnana]. Theground of being holds the karmic propensities of the threefold world; the groundconsciousness generates the six realms of the six classes of beings, (the world as containerand sentient beings who are the elixir therein contained); and ordinary consciousnessfixates on samsara by focusing upon specifics in the arena of physical enjoyment. Duringthe time of practice, the ground of being veils the empty essence of the dharmakaya; theground consciousness veils the clear nature of the sambhogakaya; and ordinaryconsciousness veils the all-pervading compassion of the nirmanakaya. In short, since theground of being, ground consciousness, and ordinary consciousness are adulterated, purepresence is veiled, and the experience of bliss does not arise as intensely as before in mind"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"and in the flow of consciousness. When the experience of bliss arises with a comfort thatwe cannot resist, we become irrevocably attached to it, and we are flung into the gods’realm of desire. Likewise the experience of clarity in cognition arises with brightness andis accompanied by the emergence of some slight psychic powers. If we become attached tothis, we will be cast into the gods’ realm of form. Likewise, insight can be bewildering—as we experience emptiness with no-thought like a kind of forgetfulness orunconsciousness, our subtle proclivities completely inactive, as in deep sleep, we may bepropelled into the formless realm of the gods.These mystical experiences are thick obstructions that block release from the threefoldworld of samsara, so do not fall under their influence for even a moment. Perceive them asbig mistakes. No matter what experiences of bliss, clarity, or no-thought arise, perceivethem as delusory signs of mystical realization and relax loosely in objectless purepresence: in this way, seize the citadel of the dharmakaya.In a nutshell, the mystical experiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thought are a product ofattachment to meditation. While there is attachment, there is no chance of seeing the face ofthe dharmakaya. We make progress only by terminating our attachment to mysticalexperience.In The Three Incisive Precepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, Precipitous descent increases the ferocity of a mountain stream;Disruption improves the yogin’s meditation. The mountain stream in the upper valley is clean and pure as it falls fast over its rockybottom, and the yogin’s meditation is best when it destroys attachment to mysticalexperience. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche related this story:When Deshag Phakmo Drupa came to see Nyamme Dakpo Rinpoche, he had some pridein thinking that he had long ago achieved the first level of meditation of the Sakya traditionof Path and Fruit. He shared his meditation experiences with Rinpoche, including his claimof reaching the first level. Rinpoche said nothing, but on the day of departure, Rinpocheasked him to come to his room. As he entered the room, Rinpoche was eating barley dough.“Did you really think that the experiences you told me about were first-level experiences?”he asked him “Yes, I did,” he replied. “I am certain that I have reached the first level.”“Did your lama confirm it?” asked Rinpoche. “Yes, my lama told me absolutely that I hadattained it,” replied Phakmo Drupa. Rinpoche picked up a hunk of barley dough and said,“Between this dough of mine and your first level—I prefer this dough,” and he broke wind.After this, Phakmo Drupa lost his pride, his view of the nature of reality focused, anduncontrived devotion toward Rinpoche as the actual buddha arose within him. Like PhakmoDrupa, yogin-meditators obtain all kinds of mystical experiences, external or internal, ondifferent levels. As they are purified upon their arising, the certainty of reality becomesmore profound until finally it is realized as what we call Dzogchen.So, in short, until we attain buddha, we are not able to abandon the attachment to the veryfine subtle karmic propensities of dualistic perception. The weak points are the points of"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"attachment, the places of deviation from the naked pure presence. All such attachments needto be abandoned. As Sri Saraha sang, Where there is attachment, let it go!Just letting go, we are entirely free.What else can anyone wish to know? Every yogin or yogini is inclined toward attachment to their own accomplishment. Whenothers pay us compliments and honor us or when we gain some little fame, we identify withthat famous person and attachment to our name arises. If the yogin or yogini cannot undo theattachment instantly in a reflexive release, obstacles will be encountered, and a lowerrebirth will ensue. We know such things happen from stories of past great masters who telltheir students that favorable conditions are less conducive to attainment than unfavorableones. When we encounter unfavorable conditions such as sickness, war, conflict, orslander, we are able to recognize them, and in a state of confidence, we can allow ourenvisionment to self-release. Favorable conditions, on the other hand, incline us towardattachment. The beautiful wife, fine children, wealth, fame, honor, and internationalrecognition with prestigious awards constitute such conditions that lead to attachment toexternal objects. If we practice buddha-dharma, our dreams may be realized, andsometimes there are actual signs of accomplishment in dreams. Sometimes those dreams arethe creation of devils, even those in which we hear the lama giving transmission. Ourthoughts are equivocal, and since our body-minds are not the same as previously, and sincevarious mystical experiences such as bliss, clarity, and no-thought arise—some pure andothers impure—we cannot distinguish between accomplishment and the miasma of thedevil’s antics.In short, whether favorable or unfavorable thoughts arise, if we are free of attachment,understanding thoughts as illusion, they will release themselves by themselves. The crucialpoint is that misfortune provides good fortune, and unfavorable conditions are actuallymore easily dealt with than favorable conditions. But for ordinary yogins and yoginis, it ismore difficult to take favorable conditions as the path than unfavorable ones. The story ofthe yogin Surya Vajra, told in the Dudjom Lingpa’s Cutting Instruction, illustrates howfavorable conditions can rebound upon us. When Surya Vajra was about to attainaccomplishment, devils conspiring to obstruct him bewitched the people of his town,especially the beautiful women. Here is how it went.Once in the great kingdom of Magadha a man called “Surya Vajra” abandoned his familyand assiduously practiced the Dharma. When his commitment was seen by the devils[maras], they conspired to harm him. The devil of form offered to show the yogin his ownfearfulness and thereby disturb him. The devil of formlessness offered to obstruct him byentering into his mind and letting him experience the heights and depths of happiness andsadness. The devil of pride offered to obstruct him by inducing equivocating thought.Finally, the devil of happiness made his offer, saying that the devil of form could showSurya Vajra fear, but Surya Vajra’s oral instruction upon selflessness could assuage that"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"fear and the yogin would gain accomplishment. Fear would actually be the cause of hisaccomplishment, and he would go beyond their sphere of influence. So fear was of no use.He went on to say that if the devil of formlessness entered the yogin’s heart and inducedvarious feelings of suffering and happiness, all of them would be easily recognized andprovide means of release into the space of freedom from rebirth. So likewise suchobstacles should be classified as favorable conditions. To the devil of pride, he said thatthe equivocal thoughts that he could induce would be countered by the oral instruction oftaking misfortune as advantage, so that also would not work. He assured the three of themthat their plans were bound to fail because they consisted of the provision of unfavorableconditions, which are easy to overcome. On the other hand, if they befriended him andprovided favorable conditions, he would come under their control forever. Asking for theirhelp in this, he promised to enslave Surya Vajra by inducing a state of enchantment, and helaughed uproariously. The great siddha Luhipa happened to witness this conference of thedevils and reported it to Surya Vajra, who was grateful, saying that to be forewarned wasto be forearmed. Luhipa left him with the warning that his weakness lay in his openness tothe temptations of pleasure.Then with Surya Vajra diligently continuing his meditation night and day, the devil ofhappiness began his agenda by bewitching the townspeople, in particular its beautifulwomen. One night in a dream they entered Surya Vajra’s mandala, and this particular devilcame forward in the guise of his personal deity. The demon assured the yogin that he hadnow gained supreme siddhi and that tomorrow he would possess all the common siddhis.Finally, the devil told him that henceforth he was free of the kind of obstacles raised bydevils and that he need not meditate so much, as he had now attained all real knowledge.Instantly Surya Vajra was transported to bliss.Next day some people came and made an offering of fine food and wealth, whichconfirmed in his mind what his personal deity had told him in the dream. A few days later abeautiful woman approached him with rice for him to eat and white cloth for him to wearand supplicated him for secret instruction. Surya Vajra was doubtful that women wereincluded in the rewards of accomplishment that his dream indicated. But he accepted her ashis consort anyway, sure that he would be free of both attachment to her and sexualpleasure. But over time his relationship with her became so deep that he could not bear tobe apart from her love and care. He could not leave her alone. She visited him often, butdespite this people still came regularly to pay him respect and make offerings.One day it occurred to him that perhaps he should abandon his meditation and become ahouseholder, but he was undecided. So he approached Guru Luhipa and shared with him hisintentions. Luhipa immediately told him that he certainly had been possessed by devils: thetransformation of his conduct already clearly indicated this. The guru advised him stronglythat he would be saved if he dissolved his attachment to the woman, but if he failed to dothis, he would fall back into samsara and remain trapped there. Surya Vajra believed whatLuhipa had told him, but realizing that he could not break his attachment to the woman, heignored the guru’s advice and committed himself to the life of a householder. All his"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"disciples and admirers then abandoned him, chiding him for his loss of commitment, andwhen his decision was reported at court, the king ordered him to be cast out. Surya Vajrahad now lost all his religious beatitude and became the poorest among the poor of thattown.At the beginning the yogin was deceived by his dream experience and became entangledin attachments. In the middle he did not realize that his woman was a gross delusion, and atthe end, diverted from Dzogchen praxis by real attachment, he fell into endless samsara. Sowhatever thoughts appear in real time or in dream must be released loosely into purepresence. If we are tempted and trapped in those ideas, we will be inveigled into themystical experiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thought and find no release from the threerealms of samsara. If we can sustain this—the release upon the arising of mysticalenvisionment—there is no need to regard discursive thinking as a fault. We can then look atit this way: the more thoughts, the more dharmakaya.The extent to which we can cut ourselves free from experiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thought is the extent to which we gain confidence in our practice. With confidence therewill be no attachment to friends or hatred toward enemies and no need to choose betweensamsara or nirvana. Whatever thought arises vanishes immediately, like writing on water.Later, not only does attachment to the experiences of bliss, clarity, and no-thoughtdisappear, but also whatever arises becomes the food of naked empty pure presence, andnonmeditation becomes the meditation of the great yogin-meditator. Since there is then nopoint of reference, there can be no wavering even for an instant from the naked purepresence. Since the function of removing the obstructing experiences of bliss, clarity, andno-thought is an autonomous reaction, no matter what we encounter—sleep, food, walking,sitting, happiness, pain, misfortune, sickness, harm from an enemy, and so on—werecognize it as a part of the universal lie of appearances. If faults of attachment arise, if werelax into the offending cognitions, they dissolve like the morning mist under the warmingsun. If obstacles are removed this way, naked pure presence is revealed like grain fallingout of its husk, and this is to be highly cherished.Regarding subconscious thoughts that arise during meditation, very subtle thoughts thatare unsensed—when they go unrecognized, they will arise one after another and graduallyengulf us in delusion, eventually appearing as gross thoughts that accumulate the karma ofdesire, hatred, and ignorance. These subconscious thoughts—thoughts that remainunrecognized—are like water running on the ground under green grass. We need noextraneous antidote to counteract them, however, because if we simply rest in naked purepresence, they are released.Further, when strong aversion is generated and immediately recognized as pure presence,the anger inherent within it is reflexively released. But in the following moment, subtleanger arises like a snake quaking, unable to rise after being cut in two. If at that moment wetarget the pure presence fiercely, and then just hang loosely, the subconscious emotiondissolves into itself. The rigzin’s instruction on dealing with subconscious thought is animperative for the great meditator."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Just by training on this path both gross and subtle attachments to bliss, clarity, and no-thought are exhausted, basic pure presence is revealed, and buddha is realized. Delusorysamsaric appearances, which had risen from the ground of being, the ground consciousness,and ordinary consciousness, now rest in their own place, utterly pure, and buddha-nature, inessence empty, in nature clear, and in compassion all-embracing, is spontaneouslyaccomplished.2.18 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MIND AND PURE PRESENCE In his commentary upon The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, When pure presence is separated from mind, it is separated from the mind’s delusion,and there is no other possible result than buddha. Its essence is buddha, and since it isnow free of defilement, it manifests as buddha. When pure presence is bound up withmind, it is called “sentient being.” When it is separated from mind, it is called“buddha.” It is very important to differentiate between the primal awareness that is pure presence andmind. Mind is structured by dualistic perception, just as water is frozen like stone byintense cold, and since there is no heat therein, it will not return to liquid until the end of theeon, just like the icecap on a mountain. Primal awareness, on the other hand, is notstructured by dualistic perception, and its inexpressible nature of transparent, pellucid,clear, pure presence is like water in a pail, naturally free of turbidity, through which thebottom of the pail is clearly visible. In brief, so long as our experience is that of anobjective field and a mind that perceives it, we are to be called “sentient beings.” Inabiding in naked empty pure presence, untainted by dualistic concepts, however, there isonly pure presence, primal awareness. Again in his commentary to The Treasury of theDharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, Ordinary unmodified consciousness, which grasps at objects, not realizing them to beuncrystallizing pure presence, is known as samsaric consciousness. Abiding in nakedpure presence, uncontaminated by hope or fear, fully radiant, and without waveringfrom that realization—that is to be understood as the nondual mind of buddha. So be wise in your differentiation.2.19 THE RIGZIN-LAMA’S PERSONAL INSTRUCTION INSPIRES MEDITATION In the tradition of buddhas past, before requesting teaching, disciples checked theauthenticity of the lama. If they found genuine quality, they requested and received the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Dzogchen teaching, from the preliminaries right up to the maturing empowerments,explanations of the method of liberation, and the supporting oral transmission. We shouldregard that rigzin-lama as no other than the Buddha himself, and not as an ordinary being.In the tantras it is said, The lama is the Buddha,The lama is the Dharma,And the lama is the Sangha.The lama is the universal creator.The lama is Sri Vajradhara. The rigzin-lama should be respected as the lord of all mandalas and the principal deity ofeach. He must examine the disciples to discover whether they could keep the tantricsamayas intact. If they are ready, he starts their mind training with the four discursivemeditations that turn the intellect back upon itself (meditations on precious human body,impermanence, karmic cause and effect, and karmic retribution) and eventually leads themto the actuality of Dzogchen. He guides them as if they were blind, providing each andevery explanation, allowing them to do the training. Sometimes when they go astray, hechides them, and when they are successful, he praises them, and thus he checks theirpractical experience.Unique to the Cutting Through phase of Dudjom Rinpoche’s The Intrinsic Nature ofBeing is a tradition of instruction and training lasting six months. These days, due toconditions in our times, this tradition is no longer followed; rather, the students read the textcursorily and receive only a superficial understanding of it. Taking what is superficial as abasis for practice, they fail to find the essence. Though the lama that we serve need not befamous, he should certainly practice what he preaches. It is very important that no matterwhat oral instruction we receive from that lama, we comprehend it completely; otherwisethere will be a gap between the instruction and ourselves. There is no use in reading aninstruction text as if it were a Sunday newspaper because it is then mere hearsay, imitatingthe lama as a monkey imitates a man, and there will be no fruit from the meditation. To finda real rigzin-lama is vital.When the lama identifies mistakes in our practice, we need to rectify those errors, just aswe straighten out what is crooked, bind what is cracked, or mend what is broken. If wefollow his instructions on removing obstacles, our practice will produce results.The rigzin Kunzang Sherab had four heart-sons—Shugang Badang, Jangang Aphen,Tsangda Dorjethar, and Serwa Yeshe Senge—to whom he taught Dzogchen, guiding them intheir practice for a long time. One day he took them to the bank of the Drichu River atDerge and asked them to sit cross-legged on the bank with him. That evening the river hadrisen so much that there was fear of floods in the village, and the lama finally left his seatand ran away. Three others followed suit, leaving only Shugang Badang still sittingunmoving. Recognizing all experience as a great lie, he sat on the bank of the river withpure presence unwavering from its own natural state and not a single hair of his body was"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"harmed: great assurance in his practice emerged within him. The lama praised ShugangBhadang highly and scolded the other three disciples, showing them the crux of Dzogchenand asking them to be like Shugang Bhadang. It was not that the lama ran away from theflood out of fear, but rather he fled in order to check his disciples’ reactions.These days some of us Dzogchen teachers just pretend to know Dzogchen, butnonetheless we propagate it, as a practical experience, throughout the world. But when weface difficulties like sickness, pain, conflict, and so on, we suffer like ordinary beings.Some of us go mad, or if not mad perhaps we make offering to the gods and demons: thisshows the inherent fault of failing to assimilate the benefit of practice. Just as past masterswould say, “He may have entered the dogma of Dzogchen, but he has not encountered thepersonal Dzogchen”—we may have received the teaching, but we have yet to assimilate it.In short, only if our praxis can be described as abiding in our own unmodified, uncontrivedmind can we say that we have assimilated Dzogchen. At that point we will have constantrecognition of naked pure presence unadulterated by the mystical experience of bliss,clarity, and no-thought.Think about our enemies and look with pure presence; examine the attachment to our nearand dear and look with pure presence. In the advent of negative situations, look with purepresence. In this way we will discover the “heat,” or effectiveness, of our practice, and wewill discover whether external circumstances can still harm us, and we will gainconfidence accordingly. That confidence is the product of our practice. If we grow immuneto misfortune now, then later, in the bardo, we can remain indifferent to the visions and gainrelease.Here is an instruction for a session of formal contemplation: while pure presence is still,we gain the aspect of clarity; when pure presence is clear, we gain looseness; and whenpure presence is dynamic, we gain release. That is realized through the instruction of thelama.In brief, detached from its still, clear, and dynamic aspects, the naked reality of purepresence in the view alone clears away all obstruction. When we have attachment to thestillness, the formless realm is created, when we have attachment to the clarity, the realm ofform is created, and when we are attached to the dynamic, the realm of desire is created.These three are the obstructions that bind us in the three realms. If we are free of attachmentto these three, then dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya arise respectively.After we rise from formal contemplation, our ongoing state is called “informalcontemplation.” During formal contemplation, “the knower” and “the known” are both freeof all conceptual references and are lost in the one intrinsic presence. When we come out ofit, our experience is fully purged of every conceptual mark and is like the middle of the sky,apparent yet nonexistent: we see all the appearances of samsara and nirvana as nonexistent,naturally arising forms of empty appearance, and in this we are supremely confident."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"3. Conduct 3.1 AN EXPLANATION OF CONDUCT THE FIELD OF our objective projections does not crystallize in the face of pure presence.So long as we abide in the formal contemplation in which the delusory discursive thinkingof dualistic perception dissolves in spaciousness, pure presence will not become lost in theobjective field. When we cease formal contemplation, then in informal contemplation,whatever arises in the physical, energetic, or mental aspects of sitting, walking, eating, orsleeping is automatically self-released as it arises. Automatic self-release is the naturalpropensity of informal contemplation, and “the conduct of inseparable meditative equipoiseand postattainment” is its corollary. In Dzogchen there is no specific form of conductseparate from the practice of view and meditation. If conduct is other than practice of viewand meditation, it is erroneous conduct. The practice of view and meditation is free of allconceptual elaboration, so it is impossible for conduct to become anything concrete orspecific or for it to take on the forms of spiritual materialism. However, that being so, donot make the mistake of mixing up view, meditation, and conduct, or confusing one withanother.Formal and informal contemplation are similar in that no matter what arises, goodthought or bad, everything reflexively releases, like a design that is drawn in waterdissolving as it is written. Whether at rest or in motion, all thought is releasedinstantaneously so that there is no continuity or connection with the next instant. Thisimplosion into a pristine, relaxed space is the natural propensity of informal contemplation.No matter what thought occurs—happy or sad, fearful or hopeful—we let it resolve itselfinto its own nature, like a wave falling back into the ocean. At this level, where the thoughtitself, without rejection, becomes the meditation, we know all experience as enchantingillusion. In the empty pure presence of the dharmakaya, the innate creativity ofuncrystallizing compassion commingled with loving-kindness naturally arises in themindstream, and that too is the natural propensity of informal contemplation. By sustaininginformal contemplation and attaining buddha, the unique quality therein is the inseparabilityof formal and informal contemplation: that is due to this manner of practicing informalcontemplation.These days some meditators claim that even though they engage in practice, it does notimprove their mind-set. Some claim that meditation itself does not help in any way. This isdue to the absence of this crucial aspect of conduct whereby we abide in formalcontemplation in the unelaborated space of intrinsic awareness. Reflexive release of"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"whatever arises in informal meditation is the central element necessary for long stays informal contemplation. As for beginners, their thoughts create blockages from one moment tothe next.It is surely true that, for ordinary people, thoughts run continuously, like ripples on apond, and if each is to be caught and rejected one by one, then even though we practice foran eon, they cannot be eradicated. Whatever thoughts arise, let them arise, and when theyhave arisen, do not cling to them, but let them disappear, like a drawing in water. Lettingthe thought disappear into its own pure presence is the Dzogchen mode.3.2 THE SIN OF IGNORANCE OF THE CONTINUITY OF REFLEXIVELY LIBERATING THOUGHT When we face the vicissitudes of happiness and suffering in business, farming, politics,domestic life, and so on, when we lose the momentum of selfish aspiration, it is enough tolook into the nature of suffering and relax. It is not necessary to destroy thoughts or obstructthem. We do not need to try to destroy or to forget the thought of a heavy loss in business,for example. When we are depressed about it, our friends may come to console us, tellingus that there is no need to worry because the neighbor has a much greater loss. In that way,they try to calm us down. Or when we grieve at the loss of an only child, our friends mightconsole us by narrating the incident of such and such a person having lost all three of his orher children all at once in the river and so on. This method of providing consolation isconsidered to be effective in human society. But it provides only temporary relief, not apermanent solution. When our best-intentioned consoling friends leave us, many morethoughts arise, and if we watch carefully, we will see that there are even more thoughts thanbefore the consolation. We will think, for example, of people who have never had businesslosses before or of people who have never lost a child. So we start to worry again. Unableto see the nature of mind or its suffering, we are simply transported to another place, whereanother set of thoughts replaces the previous set. Such an exchange of thoughts provides nobenefit.When during the time of Shakyamuni Buddha, a woman lost her beloved only son, shewas so sad that she stopped eating and was about to die. Her friends tried hard to consoleher, but all in vain, so they asked her to visit the Buddha, who perhaps could bring her sonback to life. She was revivified by this idea and went to see the Buddha. She paid homageto him and weeping asked him to bring her son back to life. Buddha agreed to do so for heron the condition that she brought him fire from a house in which no one had ever died. Sothe grieving woman went from house to house throughout the kingdom but could find nonethat had not seen death; realizing that she was not alone in her desolation, that everyonewithout exception knows death, her sadness decreased. Then she went back to the Buddhaand told him that she could not find such a fire, and the Buddha taught her about theimpermanence of both the world and the beings in it. She was consoled by his teaching, andher life was saved."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"3.3 THE PREEMINENCE OF THE MODE OF SIMULTANEOUS ARISING AND RELEASING OF THOUGHT When we can see the nature of reality, or the nature of mind, at the very moment of theappearance of happiness or sadness, we understand it to be unreal, just like a magicalillusion or a dream. If we sustain that insight, mingling formal contemplation and informalcontemplation, then intrinsic awareness of ultimate buddha, which itself is theinseparability of formal contemplation and informal contemplation, will abideunchangeably.In some non-Buddhist schools, the purpose of meditation is to extinguish consciousnessof the five senses of the body, which is like putting thoughts in prison. Staying in that statefor a long time is thought by them to be meditation. It is considered to be an antidote tosuffering, but it provides only temporary relief, or as mentioned before, it provides merelya change in the kind of suffering. It does not eradicate pain. We may shake off the leaves ofa poison tree and lop off its branches, but unless the root is severed, the tree will growback again. So it is with thoughts.Some people think that we suffer because of previous karma or because it is the will ofGod, and they endure it. Stopping up the five doors of the senses may temporarily blockgross thoughts, but not for long, and it can never be permanent. In Entering the Way of theBodhisattva, Shantideva says, What is momentarily blocked is released again,Like an unconscious trance. The gods reside in unconscious trance or samadhi for a thousand years, but after the powerof the samadhi is exhausted and the discursive thoughts of the five poisonous emotions ariseagain, they are reborn into samsara. Such samadhi is not permanent happiness. That path isnot relevant to those yearning for liberation and omniscience. Like AIDS patients who takemedicine to reduce their fever and vitamins to strengthen their immune system but who needto address the root of the disease if they are to be cured, yogins and yoginis may exchangeone set of thoughts for another, more congenial one, but their suffering will not beeradicated.Those who think that stopping thought is meditation will be reborn merely in the realm ofthe unconscious gods and will attain neither liberation nor omniscience. Those who stopthoughts and meditate on the nature of a still mind find it very difficult to apply the antidoteto emotions. Consider the life of the fallen yogin Surya Vajra who after meditating for manyyears finally seemed to have achieved his goal only to lose it through attachment to aphantom woman. A Hindu yogin may sit in the Joyous Samadhi for many years only toawaken from it and indulge in hatred and plunder of neighboring kingdoms, as we can readi n The Extraordinary Exalted Praise of Totshun Drubje. When a strong intention toachieve attainment on our own path results in failure to eradicate emotional afflictions, itprobably indicates that stopping thoughts or exchanging one set of thoughts for another isnot an effective antidote to suffering. Whatever suffering arises is, in Dzogchen"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"nonmeditation, released in its own shoes, like a snake uncoiling itself, without the need ofextraneous assistance.3.4 MEDITATION EXPERIENCE ARISES NATURALLY IN THE MINDSTREAM The crucial manner of release, like a snake uncoiling its knots, is not something to beachieved in a handful of energetic meditation sessions. We need to relax into it in order tocome to experience it as a constant. In that way it becomes familiar, and there is no need forany purposeful or fruitful application of antidotes because the counteraction is appliedautomatically, just as a potter who applies a strong push to the wheel does not need toapply force again before the pot is complete. Once we are accustomed to such an automaticprocess of release, whatever thoughts of happiness or sorrow arise simply dissolve bythemselves, and, unaffected by them, we experience confidence arising automatically. Whenstrong hatred or pain arises adventitiously and we recognize the immediate release of thethought, a laugh or some other extraordinary expression of joy may suddenly escape us.Whether significant or trivial, no matter what activity we perform in samsara, there isnothing that is not mixed with suffering. All experience is of the nature of all-pervasivesuffering since it is derived from impulsive habit. Take the dream birth of a son. First, weare happy at his birth; later, we worry about his health; and at the end, there is the grievoussuffering of his death. If we think about it closely, these three aspects are all unreal,although in the dream we perceived them to be real, and we did actually suffer. Dreamerswho dreamt the experience never moved from their bed for a moment, so there was no waythey could have experienced the suffering, yet until they awoke, they felt that the experiencewas real. When we are in dreamland and we understand that we are asleep and that we aredreaming, then even though the dream continues, the suffering dissolves like mist in sky. InThe Thirty-Seven Practices of the Bodhisattva, Ngulchu Tokme says, All suffering is like a son’s death in a dream,And we are sick of believing delusion to be true!When we encounter untoward circumstances,The bodhisattva sees them all as illusion. No matter what happy, sad, or neutral thoughts arise, for ordinary beings, the manner inwhich they appear is the same. But for the yogin who is relaxed in the nature of mind, themanner of release is special since, for such a one, arising and release occur simultaneously.Just like a drawing on water, appearances vanish. This is a crucial point of practice.3.5 WHEN CONDUCT CONSISTS OF SIMULTANEOUS ARISING AND RELEASING, IT IS FREE OFKARMA AND ITS EFFECTS"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"In the yoga of crucial simultaneous arising and release, the mere arising of desire and angerdoes not generate bad karma. To take a single thought as an example—the thought has goneas soon as it arises. Until it is created, it exists only in the future. In the present, it has notime to rest, and since the object, agent, and action have no time to interact in the timelesspresent, karma cannot be accumulated. Karma can be accumulated only in the continuity ofthought, and because in Dzogchen yoga, thoughts are released as they arise, thus inhibitingcontinuity, no karma is accumulated and suffering does not arise. No aggregation ofcircumstances can establish itself in the first moment, so no continuity is possible and noresult is possible.Whatever appears in the daytime did not first appear in a dream, but if we have a strongimpression of a beautiful object again and again in the daytime, it may arise in a dream. Ifwe are not attached to the beautiful object even for a moment, then there is little possibilityof its arising in the dream. It is the repeated attachment to it that makes a continuity of it andthat causes it to arise in a dream. Likewise, consider a seed for which the conditions of itsgermination last only a second; there is only a very small chance of its producing a shoot. Ifthe seed is planted and lasting conditions obtain, then the seed will most probablygerminate and shoot. Surely it is true that a single watering of a seed will not engendergrowth. Whatever thought arises, if it is released in the moment, even though emotionalaffliction may arise as in ordinary beings, because of the difference that immediate releasemakes, we are not touched by karma. In his Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpasays, Arising, abiding and release in an uninterrupted flow—No break in the arising and dissolving—In an unbroken stream, cause and effect are inseparable.Because there is no causality, the abyss of samsara is crossed,And if the abyss is traversed, how can there be any downfall? When in the first moment of arising, thought releases itself and there is sameness, there isneither the chance nor the possibility of either karma or causality. We neither judge anegative thought as sin and abandon it purposefully nor judge a positive one as meritoriousand cultivate it. Attachment to positive thoughts may be virtuous attachment, but it casts ashadow over natural perfection. It is a critical point that we are released into the nakedemptiness of pure presence without abandoning the bad thoughts or cultivating the good.Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche says in his commentary on the Heart-Essence of the Dakini, Generally, the informal contemplation has two kinds of meditator, the real and nominalmeditators. The real informal contemplation between sessions allows only anunelaborated formal contemplation to take place so that later the meditator will arriveat the crucial place of buddha where formal contemplation and informal contemplationbetween sessions are identical.When the nominal between-session meditator arises from formal contemplation, his"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"experience is the ordinary activity of body, speech, and mind lacking thearising/liberating function. His experience consists of the perception of materialobjects in a concrete sensory field. The nominal informal contemplation is no antidote to the apprehension of things asconcrete and substantial, so it cannot release us from emotional afflictions such as desireand lust.These days many people with spiritual pride say that religious practice does not affectthe mental life and that meditation cannot transform the mind. In The Three IncisivePrecepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, Knowing meditation but not release,Isn’t that the divine trance of the gods? The mere ability to abide in formal contemplation free of mental elaboration does notnecessarily take us into informal contemplation that is different from the ordinary activity ofbody, speech, and mind. If we are unable to mix the practice of unelaborated formalcontemplation with informal contemplation, there will be no benefit.If, on the other hand, we can integrate our experience of simultaneous arising andliberating and our experience of reflexive release and liberation into pure presence, and soon, with the happiness and sadness of body, speech, and mind, real benefit will emerge. Ifwe cannot integrate the two, our meditation is like the concentration of child’s play—boundby attachment. During formal contemplation, gross happiness and sadness will not arise, butwhen we get up from shamata, the joy or the pain will come as before. Just as we contain aheap of dust by sitting down slowly on it, but upon our getting up, the dust arises in clouds,in the concentrated absorption of child’s play, gross thoughts are stopped for a while, andwe seem to experience happiness, but when we arise from the concentration, we find thatmore gross thoughts intrude than before. This is why people say there is no benefit frommeditation.These days it is rare for informal contemplation practitioners to have certainty in theprofound view. Due to this, their meditation is just like taking time out and that will notrelease anyone from the threefold world. When strong sufferings, acute pains, ormisfortunes temporarily afflict our minds and sickness afflicts our bodies, it sometimesseems that we react like ordinary people. That occurs first because we are not recognizingthe profound Dzogchen view of Cutting Through. Second, even though we are meditating,our meditation is based on a mere intellectual understanding of the alpha-purity free of allpropositions, and therefore we do not abide in the essence of naked pure presence. Finallyall effort is meaningless if we lack confidence in its reflexive function of arising andrelease during informal contemplation between sessions . During life, death, and the bardo,when we are tortured by intense fear, sickness, and sadness, and there is no help, toremember this instruction is the crux."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"3.6 A CATEGORICAL ASSERTION THAT DZOGCHEN TRANSCENDS CAUSE AND EFFECT In the informal contemplation phase, if the crucial function of release upon arising isrecognized at all times and in every circumstance, then no matter what act of body, speech,or mind is performed, since it cannot go beyond the display of dharmakaya—the naturalcreativity of pure presence—karma is not accumulated. As the rigzin Garab Dorje said,“Dzogchen is beyond causality.” For those who have doubt regarding that statement,consider these two aspects. First, during the actual engagement in formal contemplation thatis free of any conceptual elaboration, because we cannot see even an iota of karmicrelationship, we can assert that causality does not exist in the natural state of reality. It issaid that no recognition nor any actor or action can ever be established in that state.When Jampel Shenyen heard that the rigzin Garab Dorje was giving teaching beyond thelaw of karma, he was incensed and went out to challenge him with the intention of defeatinghim in debate. These two debated for many years and finally Jampel Shenyen admitteddefeat and regretted his denigration of Garab Dorje. In contrition and in order to expiate hisfault, he tried to cut out his tongue, but Garab Dorje stopped him, advising him that heshould instead study and then teach the precepts beyond karmic cause and effect, predictingthat all his sins would be purified thereby. Jampel Shenyen became devoted to Garab Dorjeand finally asked him to accept him as his student, and they become guru and disciple.The key point here is that while Dzogchen prevails, there is no causality—the greatperfection is beyond causality. Moreover, while sustaining the view that is part and parcelof the natural informal contemplation, there is no karmic cause and effect to be seen. Ininstantaneous release upon inception, cause and effect are inseparable, so there can be noperception of causality. In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, If we examine our authentic nature, nothing can be said to exist therein;Likewise, taking authenticity as the path, becoming one with it,Knowing it only in a moment of unimaged, nonconceptual vision,Consumed by it, we are completely, transparently naked. Without any base or support in this supermatrix,Afflictive emotion, karma, and habitual propensitiesCreate magical, illusory, apparitional games,And since we need freedom in it, let causality be resolved. Whether we are in formal contemplation free of all conceptual elaboration or in theinformal contemplation sustaining reflexive release of whatever arises, beyond all causalpropositions, causality cannot be recognized. That is the first aspect for consideration.The second point is that Dzogchen transcends karmic causality only in the state of purepresence. When pure presence goes outside the natural condition or wanders during themundane informal contemplation phase, karmic causality is inevitable and must be heeded.That is discussed below."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"3.7 SO LONG AS DUALISTIC PERCEPTION OBTAINS, HEED KARMA AND ITS EFFECTS The straight answer to the question whether Dzogchen yogins and yoginis should follow thelaws of karma in all situations is “Yes!” When we leave the state of basic pure presence orformal contemplation and enter what is called “informal contemplation,” we should followthe laws of karma as nondeceptive, without any disavowal. We should never denigratecausality even conventionally. On the level of definitive meaning, causality cannot be heldas a truly existing process; immaculately transcending the two extremes of permanent andimpermanent, it becomes the sovereign of all gradual approaches.In the Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, Creativity projects display into another dimension,Where it appears as the multifarious variety of the universe.Never say categorically that there is no cause and effect.The complex conditions that arise from interdependence are incalculable;The states of samsaric delusion and nirvanic joy are incalculable;A mass of causes and conditions constitutes a sublime synchronicity. When contemplation and real informal contemplation are broken, we enter the state called“nominal informal contemplation.”Due to the flickering of dualistic thought that seems to possess concrete attributes,increasingly subtle karmic causes and effects should be taken into account. In TheChronicles of Padmasambhava, discovered by Orgyen Lingpa, Padmasambhava says, My view is higher than the sky.My karma is finer than barley flour. The meaning here is that every single trivial action is determined by previous action andthat every present action will have its repercussion in the future.Also in The Chronicles of Padmasambhava, it is related—as in The Legend of theGreat Stupa of Boudhanath—that in a past life Padmasambhava, king Trisong Deutsen,and the bodhisattva abbot Shantarakshita were three brothers who constructed theBoudhanath Stupa in the Kathmandu Valley. After they had built the dome of the stupa, theyprayed in front of it, and by the power of each of the brother’s prayers, the first was born asPadmasambhava, the second as king Trisong Deutsen, and the third as the bodhisattvaShantarakshita. When they met in Tibet, buddha-dharma flourished in that demonic land.This was by virtue of the merit that they had accumulated by constructing the great stupa andmaking such strong aspirations.When the Buddha had a headache and his disciples asked the reason, the Buddha toldthem that once he had been the son of a fisherman in the Sakya kingdom. One day his fathercaught two big fish and bound the line to a pillar, leaving the fish to flounder on the hotsand, and he had laughed at their suffering. “Now, even though I have become enlightened,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"due to the residual karma of that laughter, I have a headache,” said the Buddha.“Furthermore, if I had not become enlightened, at this very moment the Licchavis would beplundering the Sakya kingdom.” Karmic causality is beyond the intellect to comprehend orcalculate. It is impossible to explain it here. Until the thoughts of sentient beings cease,karmic causality will prevail. In The Wish-Fulfilling Treasury, Longchenpa says, The mind sets the pattern,And mind accumulates karma,Mind projects appearances,And mind applies labels.Strive to subdue delusive mind. Those who enter the natural state of Dzogchen are not themselves affected by karma and cantherefore explain the particular karmas of the conventional world, disciples, and ordinarybeings. They can become the teacher of the inevitable repercussions of karma, wise indescribing the stages, paths, and cause and effect.It was during the first turning of the wheel that the Buddha, our teacher, taught karmiccause and effect, giving us provisional instruction in the presentation of the four nobletruths. Some may think that the provisional teaching is not even conventionally true and thatthe Buddha was actually deceiving his disciples, but that is a seriously wrong-headed wayof thinking. Until mental concepts and mental events vanish into spaciousness or disappearin the natural state of Dzogchen, the mind is not exhausted. Until the mind is exhausted, thefive poisonous emotions that depend upon it will inevitably arise. Sentient beings in theirenvironments will be created continuously, like pots flying off a potter’s wheel: goodkarmic effects will eventuate in the upper realms of samsara, the realms of the gods, titans,and men, and bad karmic effects in the lower realms, those of the hells, hungry ghosts, andanimals. For that reason, so long as there is a mind, we are tied to samsara, where the lawsof karma are established. So long as beings exist, it is certain that causes gave them birthand their present actions produce effects. In his Ornament of the Middle Way, the abbotShantarakshita said, Depending upon causes before and before that,After and after that, effects will arise. Just now we need to train in both the formal and informal contemplation of Dzogchen anddissolve all the conceptual elaborations of mind. Then one day the mind that grasps at allphantoms will be completely exhausted, and when light-forms of primal awareness arise,there will be no causal interference, in the same way that the sky remains unaffected whenwe throw colored powders into it. Since there is utterly no desire for, or hatred toward,material objects any more, and there is no attachment to causation or to samsara or nirvana,we develop strong trust in the inevitability of relativistic moral laws and become wise inshowing them to others."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Some contemporary teachers of Dzogchen, without differentiating between formal andinformal contemplation, state categorically that karmic cause and effect does not operate inDzogchen and that that is the special characteristic of it. This is not only self-deluding butdestroys the seeds of faith in others. Be careful of those who would lead us astray. Again, Irepeat the famous lines of Longchenpa in The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Creativity projects display into another dimension,Where it appears as the multifarious variety of the universe.Never say categorically that there is no cause and effect. Jowoje Atisha said, Karma exists until thought is exhausted.You can depend upon the maturation of your karma! Until thoughts are exhausted, until we are free of all mental and sensory elaboration, and solong as there is dualistic perception, there is karma. From that karma sentient beings andtheir projected environments are established, and thereby all the various sufferings of thesix realms, high and low, are inevitably endured. That is certain. Until the dualisticgrasping of mind is either quickly exhausted through Dzogchen nonmeditation, or veryslowly exhausted on the sutric path of Approach with Signs, which may take three countlesseons, in short, until the mind is free of concepts, the abuse of karmic causality is adamnable risk.Longchenpa says in The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, If we vacillate, losing that essential space,The intellectual mind at work becomes samsara itself,Involving the causal concatenation that precludes resolution,And, inevitably, confused beings fall lower and lower.In the supreme secret that is Dzogchen, on the other hand,We never stray from intrinsic spaciousness,And its creative expressions naturally fall back into their source:This vision implies resting in immutable sameness. So long as pure presence abides in the dharmakaya, we are untouched by karmic cause andeffect because in that space there is no opportunity for the movement of dualistic thought.When we waver from pure presence, the speculative concepts that are the function of thedualistic mind tie us to samsara, and in that dualistic condition, samsara and nirvana, causeand effect, are established, and we cannot go beyond it. Unable to transcend cause andeffect, clinging to things as substantially true, we are caught in the trap of samsara, andmistaken in that way, we go down to the lower realms and suffer accordingly. For thatreason the supreme secret of Dzogchen yogins and yoginis is that they are never separated"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"from the space free of conceptual elaboration. No matter what positive or negative thoughtarises, right from the moment of its appearance, they hang loosely, without rejecting oraccepting it, in the primordially released ground of the dharmakaya. That is unwaveringmind abiding in the magnificent sameness of reality, uninfluenced by karmic cause andeffect, where they cannot be harmed by karmic retribution, and no matter what conceptsarise, however they arise, they are all released in the matrix of the dharmakaya.Only Dzogchen yogins and yoginis with such an understanding can boast of freedom fromkarma. Just as when we fall sick, we need a doctor to heal us, or when attacked by anenemy, we need to fight, or when we suffer some great loss and thus endure some acutepain—as long as we are at the mercy of circumstances, we should never say that there is nokarmic cause and effect, or even consider the possibility of its absence, because we cannothide it from ourselves. In Entry into the Middle Way, Chandrakirti said, “Take karmiccause and effect for granted!” Just a single erroneous thought about the validity of karmiccause and effect will bring endless negative karma. So it is imperative that we trust in theconventional law of karma and follow correctly the rejection of vice and the cultivation ofvirtue.3.8 THE EVIDENCE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF UNCHANGEABLE SELF-BENEFICIAL PUREPRESENCE IS EQUANIMITY IN THE FACE OF THE EIGHT WORLDLY OBSESSIONS In brief, although it is difficult to evaluate one’s own mind, still, we cannot keep the mindsecret from ourselves. Also we cannot judge the worth of our training. If our pure presenceis constant, or if genuine emptiness and compassion are generated, then the evidence of thatis an absence of hope regarding the four positive mundane obsessions and an absence offear in the face of the four negative mundane obsessions. The four enjoyable mundaneobsessions are taking pleasure in profit, sensory pleasure, good reputation, and praise, andthe four abhorrent mundane obsessions are the loss that leads to poverty, the pain fromillness and robbery, the notoriety produced by false accusation, and the blame in public forour faults or public criticism in general.3.9 THE EVIDENCE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF UNCHANGEABLE ALTRUISTIC PURE PRESENCEIS SPONTANEOUS COMPASSION AND RELIANCE ON THE LAWS OF KARMA AND THEIR RESULTS Since beings of the six realms have not understood the nature of pure presence, internallydue to dualistic perception as the cause and externally due to the five sensual pleasures ascondition, so all beings from beginningless time cling to “I” and “mine,” and, as in anightmare, they suffer. For them we have compassion. Every single one of them has been aparent who cared for us lovingly. They all wish for happiness, but they are unable to findthe cause of it. With all their heart, they want to avoid suffering, but they always create itfor themselves and are tormented by it. They are like a crowd of the blind left in the middle"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"of a field without any help. Compassion for them is a natural response, like a mother’sinstant response to her baby’s cries, as if she were caught by a naked electric wire. A yoginor yogini who has realized emptiness naturally feels compassion toward confused beingsfrom the bottom of the heart.In his Ketaka Commentary, Ju Mipham has: In those who have realized emptiness, strenuous impulsion toward equanimity in theface of the eight worldly obsessions and effortless compassion for others arisesimultaneously in the mindstream. And in the Ornament of the Middle Way, the abbot Shantarakshita said, Toward those beings who have not understood,Immense compassion arises. Then the individual who has attained the immaculate view gains immeasurably more trust inkarmic cause and effect than before. The lama who shows us the natural perfection of mindis regarded as the real buddha. Compassion arises naturally for those beings who have notunderstood the nature of mind and that compassion is uncontrived, unfabricated, and arisestogether with every perception.Furthermore, we manifest potential that we were not even aware of possessing earlier.Our reasoning is more clear, and common clairvoyance and the ability to perform miraclesand so forth increase like the waxing moon and creep up on us without our being aware ofit. At that time we do not need confirmation from anyone else as to whether our view isgenuine or not. We can be quite sure of it ourselves. We will have lost any pride andhaughtiness that we might have had on the path to nirvana. From then onward whatever actsof body, speech, and mind we perform are all naturally correct. Not a whit of any sort ofdesire or hatred arises toward anything, and if some gross thought of desire or hatred arisesall of a sudden, it is immediately one with luminous mind, like a wave mixing again withthe ocean. All thoughts will dissolve in the dharmakaya.Remember what Sri Saraha sang, The ultimate wealth is contentment;Detachment is the ultimate pleasure. If we are not satisfied with the wealth and reputation that we possess presently, then ourdissatisfaction will be limitless. Even if we have a mountain of food in front of us, still wewill feel hunger, and if we have a lake of water, still we will feel thirsty. From history weknow that some rulers spent their entire lives in expanding their empire and power—AdolfHitler, for example—but still they were not satisfied.If we become attached to beautiful things, we will suffer either directly or indirectly.Desire and hatred are the cause of suffering right from the beginning. Unless desire and"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"hatred can be released, there is suffering; in the same way fire, unless released, will burnthe hand that holds it. Suffering ensues from attachment to our jewels, our money, and ofcourse to our favorite child. Shakyamuni Buddha abandoned everything—his kingdom,subjects, wife, and son—and renounced the world. This was an object lesson to show thatwe need to abandon desire and anger, for surely he did not renounce without good reason.Likewise, Atisha, who was the son of an emperor of Bengal, abandoned all his pleasuresand renounced the mundane world.In short, it is very important that no matter what we do in body, speech, and mind, weshould be free of attachment. Even regarding the activities to which we are not attached,when suddenly some happiness or suffering arises in them, be aware of it immediately andwithout modifying anything in any way, hang loosely in that perception, letting the mindsettle into its own place, like a huge wave returning again to the ocean.All good or bad thoughts that arise, whether happy or sad, are all creativity. Creativity isessentially pure presence and the authentic characteristic of self-arising and reflexivelyreleased conduct. We need to engage in that training of arising and liberating whereinthoughts have no previous or subsequent phase. When we have such praxis, we need notconscientiously abandon bad thoughts or cultivate good thoughts. If we realize thatwhatever thoughts arise are all released right from the instant of their arising, we know thatsuch thoughts are the food of naked empty pure presence—the creativity of the dharmakaya.Even though there is no object of meditation, we are not distracted for even a second, andwe are called a “meditation practitioner,” although there is no meditation. Since there isnothing for us to do—we are simply looking at the essence of the thought as it arises andfalls—there is no better way or easier meditation than this.Likewise even though the way emotional affliction arises in yogins and yoginis is similarto that in ordinary beings, the manner of liberation is unique to Dzogchen yogins andyoginis. There is no need, however, to stress its superiority.3.10 PRACTITIONERS OF THE LOWER APPROACHES ARE BOUND BY STRENUOUS EFFORT Nothing that is taught in the sutras and tantras—the emptiness free of conceptualelaboration, the creative stage, fulfillment stage, the fulfillment stage with signs, energycontrol and yoga, and so on—goes beyond eliminating, modifying, or transforming thought.When we actually look at those lower-approach meditators, all of whom make distinctionsbetween antidotes and what is to be rejected, we see that, from the perspective of effortlessDzogchen, they are all afflicted by the sickness of subtle striving.No matter how profound the stages and paths of these lesser approaches, during the mainpractice of meditation on the view, some thoughts are sent off only to be welcomed anew,or one set of thoughts is exchanged for another. There can be no going beyond this subtledualistic clinging to thoughts. Longchenpa, in The Heart-Essence of Vimalamitra, quotingthe rigzin Garab Dorje, says, “Intellectual control of meditation that opens upon the view isso fatiguing!” If only our thoughts were naturally released instantaneously as they arise, like"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"a drawing written in water, then informal contemplation itself would become the antidote toour most subtle proclivities toward dualistic perception. Conduct assimilated on the path ofpractice during the present period of training, which sustains the reflexive release ofwhatever arises during informal contemplation, is the condition of buddha—the completeidentity of formal and informal contemplation.3.11 CONDUCT IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE THREE MODES OF RELEASE The natural praxis of Dzogchen is to be sustained over a long period. When the first thoughtarises for beginner yogins and yoginis, they recognize it, just like meeting their long-lostfriend. The mere arising of a thought, whether happy or sad, good or bad, occasions therecognition that it is the creativity of pure presence, that it is a subjective illusion, and thatit is released as it stands. In the middle of the practice, when meditation has improvedsomewhat, the thought releases itself like a snake uncoiling. Whatever happiness orsuffering arises in mind simultaneously releases into the matrix of pure presence, wherehope does not arise with joy or fear with sorrow. Finally, when the meditation is complete,neither benefit nor detriment arises with a thought, like a thief entering an empty house—whatever negative situation arises can no longer disturb us, can have no effect upon us, andwe act like children gazing at wall paintings.Consider Serwa Gomchen, a close disciple of Yukhok Chadrel Choying Rangdol, whostayed in retreat his whole life engaged in the praxis of Dzogchen. He had five brothers,and all of them were very rich and famous in the locality. There were twenty-five people inhis family including wives and children. They were a very powerful family, and in usingtheir power, they were so envied and loathed by the local people that the people decidedone day in a secret meeting to kill them all. The people would not be happy if even a singleone of them remained alive, or so they said. And so it was that one night, when the entirefamily was gathered in their house, the people set it ablaze, and the locals waited aroundthe blazing fire with guns, letting none of the family escape—all were killed. The next dayone of the relatives of the dead family went to see Serwa Gomchen in the mountains andtold him what had happened, weeping the whole time. The Gomchen enunciated the syllable“A” once, and then pretending not to have heard properly, he asked him to repeat the story.When he had heard the story again, he said, “Now a termite’s nest has been destroyed!” Hestayed totally relaxed, without grief or anger, and never mentioned it again. Dzogchenyogins and yoginis are that kind of person.If we ordinary human beings are able to, we fight our enemies physically, if not, wechallenge them in court. If we cannot fight them openly, we perform ritual magic and invokethe gods or naga serpents to harm them. In that way, when we face misfortune, theimperative of remaining in the Dzogchen view is forgotten, and we cannot remember even asingle word of its precepts. This is because we have been unable to build confidence in theview or to sustain the meditation. If only we could make the habitual activity of body,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"speech, and mind into equanimous conduct, then, even though we remain ordinary beings,we would not suffer acute pain or unbearable suffering at the occurrence of any smallpersonal reverse of fortune. There are many stories of past masters who illustrateindifference in the face of what would be for us intolerable suffering.If we can become yogins and yoginis who no longer discriminate between good and bad,or between samsara and nirvana, then we will be released from the abyss of hope and fear.At this stage all karmic causality is constantly resolved in the basic spaciousness of alpha-purity, and there is no fault in saying that there is no karmic cause and effect. But while weare yet caught in the net of hope and fear, proud to be a Dzogchen yogin or yogini,presumptuous regarding our status, saying that there is no karmic cause and effect, actinginstinctively and impulsively, doing whatever we like in body, speech, and mind, then bythe force of inevitable circumstances, we will be reborn into the limitless lower realms andsuffer for eons.3.12 THE PERSPECTIVES OF BOTH SUTRA AND TANTRA AGREE IN REJECTING GROSS EMOTIVITY In short, in both sutra and tantra, gross emotion is to be abandoned. In the Vinaya it is saidby the Buddha, Whatever teaching is the cause of desire, directly or indirectly, and whatever teachingis not the cause of separation from desire, that is not buddha-dharma, and it is not thediscipline, and I am not its teacher. I teach what frees from desire and frees from thecause of desire and that is the vinaya. Whether it is the sutra or the tantra approach, however it is said, it should be an antidote todesire, hatred, and ignorance. If it is not an antidote to emotion, no matter how high or deepit is, it is a false teaching. There are many skillful means or profoundly different methods insutra and tantra to tackle emotional afflictions. If there were not, then there would be nonecessity to differentiate between sutra and tantra. Concerning the manner of abandoningemotivity, in his commentary upon Finding Comfort and Ease in Meditation, Longchenpasays, In brief, reject emotivity through one’s personal vows, purify it in luminous mind, andtake tantra as the path: these three are one in the task of abandoning emotionalaffliction, just as avoiding swallowing poison, treating poison with medicine, andtransmuting it by mantra are the specifics of avoiding death by poison. Thereby, no matter what physical or vocal acts yogins and yoginis perform, they do notpermit their emotivity to grow overtly gross. Avoidance, neutralization, and transmutationact as automatic antidotes to gross emotion. Such practice can define the conduct of yoginsand yoginis. If we fail to transcend desire, hatred, and ignorance, no matter what method we"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"use, we will be left with ordinary gross emotivity, samsaric karma will accumulate, andsuffering will follow us like running water. So avoid boasting of high conduct and profoundview and follow the Vinaya: Trust in karma and the maturation of karma and guard your vows like your eyeballs. Ifyou do not, you will burn in the lower realms. If we have any attachment to the experience of samsara or nirvana, suffering inevitablyfollows; if we are detached from those experiences, then happiness will result. This isestablished not only by those who have deep experience of meditation but also by our ownordinary experience. In his Collected Fragments, Patrul Rinpoche says, What we cling to, abandon,For attachment is the work of the devil;With confidence that objects of attachment are illusion,That all and everything is play—ganachakra feasting! Regardless of whether attachment is to something good or something bad, if it is attachment,it is the cause of suffering. If only we could engage wealth, fame, and a youthful bodywithout desire or attachment, we would be able to experience total temporal happiness. Wewould then not accumulate negative karma, and, recognizing everything as the creativity ofpure presence, we would experience all sense pleasures as the play of the primordialunborn space of Samantabhadri’s great happiness. In this way, we practice the yoga ofconstant enjoyment in the feast offering of primal awareness.For yogins and yoginis who have confidence in the yoga of constant enjoyment, everysingle action of their body, speech, and mind is an offering at the feast, and there is no needto strive for the accumulation of merit or develop view, meditation, conduct, or fruition. AsJigme Lingpa says in The Chariot of Wisdom, Thoughts released into pure presence, the artificialities of view, meditation, conduct,and fruit all crumbling, regular ritual and daily religious devotions ceasing to be aburden, free of all conceptual elaboration, inseparable from luminous mind, reality isall-embracing. This type of nonattachment to the view, meditation, and conduct is difficult for thebeginner, but it is very important to carry the release of whatever arises—all thenonattached movements of body, speech, and mind—into the bed of the dharmakaya. Thatcan be called “excellent conduct.”It is obvious that attachment to the eight worldly obsessions must be abandoned, butattachment to the vows of self discipline, the vows of a bodhisattva, and the commitmentsof a tantrika should also be forsaken. The latter are positive attachments and should not berejected by ordinary people, but since such attachment is an obstruction to buddha, even"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"such noble attachment must be cast off by Dzogchen yogins and yoginis.Impure samsaric experience in which nonexistent illusory appearances are believed tohave substantial existence and the peaceful visions of nirvana labeled immaculate: thesetwo are mutually dependent and therefore exist as nothing other than mentally imputedexperience. The word “father” is given meaning by a son, and the word “son” is validatedby “father”; in the same way “the noble attachment to experience of nirvana” and “theignoble attachment to experience of samsara” are mutually dependent in the intellect. Whenthoughts naturally remain in the matrix of pure presence, which is quite free of conceptualelaboration, they disappear, like mist dissolving in the sky. In that the concepts of samsaraand nirvana vanish in natural, genuine, intrinsic presence, the duality of samsara andnirvana is resolved.3.13 INFUSING CONDUCT WITH THE SIX PERFECTIONS In The Three Incisive Precepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, “Bodhisattvas engage in sociallybeneficial conduct;” accordingly, Dzogchen yogins and yoginis, engaging in the informalcontemplation phase of the arising and liberating of magical illusion, train themselves onthe path of the six perfections but with nonattachment as the principle. Bodhisattva conductis the training, but the Dzogchen view is fundamental and crucial.Then, since there is no reification of anything inside or outside, there is no break in thecontinuity of the perfection of generosity. Since the hankering after worldly pleasures isdoused, leaving no taint of vicious thoughts, there is no break in the continuity of theperfection of moral discipline. Since the egoism of Rudra is no longer affective, withoutanger there is no break in the continuity of the perfection of patience. In the reality of thepure presence of the dharmakaya, mind is naturally endowed with projective energy, sothere is no break in the continuity of the perfection of perseverance. With freedom from theoscillation between the polarities of dualistic hope and fear, there is no break in thecontinuity of the perfection of concentration. Since there is no point of reference inhomogenized samsara and nirvana, there is no break in the continuity of the perfection ofinsight [prajña].Concerning the benefit of making offerings to pure-lands with an attitude of detachment,consider this story. Once in the kingdom of Varanasi a mother gave birth to a baby girl,whom she then wrapped in white cloth. When the child grew up and matured into a verybeautiful girl, many kings, ministers, and wealthy men sought her hand in marriage to theirsons. The girl was reluctant to commit to the life of a householder and refused all proposalsof marriage. Instead, she approached the Buddha Shakyamuni, asked for ordination as anun, and was ordained. Within only a short period after her ordination, she achieved thelevel of an arhat. When Ananda asked Shakyamuni the cause of her attainment, he narratedthe following story:Once, during the eon of the Buddha Sokyab, there lived a very poor couple. Every daywhen the Buddha taught the dharma, the king, the nobility, and the wealthy townspeople"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"would make grand offerings to him and listen to his teaching, but the poor couple had not amite to offer. Their sole possession was a single piece of cloth that they used as clothes inthe daytime and as a blanket at night. Whoever remained behind during the day would sitcovered with grass to hide his or her nakedness. One day, a group of monks wandering intown spoke of the great benefit of giving to the Buddha with generosity, and the womanheard it. Inspired by it, weeping, she asked a monk how she could make offerings to theBuddha, given her pathetic condition. The monk replied, “You make your offering to theBuddha according to your capacity. Buddha has no judgmental thought about the offeringsmade to him. Merit will accrue according to the gift.” “I may be poor in this life,” thoughtthe woman, but if only I can accumulate merit now, I need not be so poor in the next life.”And she was determined to give generously however she could. She asked the monks towait for her, and she went to her husband to discuss it with him, telling him of the benefitsof generosity and encouraging his own sense of giving. He reminded her that he had nothinghidden away and that the only thing they possessed was the cloth. They agreed to give thecloth to the Buddha and subsequently gave it to the monks. Later, in the evening, when theassembly made offerings of gold, silver, pearls, brocade, and so on, to the Buddha, themonks made an offering of the filthy piece of cloth, full of lice and nits. Buddha requestedthem to bring the cloth to him, and he joyfully placed it under his feet. Asked by the king forthe reason, the Buddha replied, “Among the offerings of the day, the cloth of this poorcouple is the best. They gave it with pure faith and without attachment or concern for nameor fame. Through the power of this couple’s generosity, they will take rebirth in richfamilies for eighty lives, and from the moment of their birth, they will be covered withwhite cloth. At the end of their eightieth life, they will hear the Buddha Shakyamuni’steaching, and they will attain arhatship.” So impressed were the king and queen that theygave the couple each a set of clothes, and food to eat, and they became rich in that verylifetime.The root of that couple’s huge benefit was the absence of any attachment to their offeringand the complete absence of expectation of any reward, particularly in terms of reputation.The generosity was pure, and within their lifetime they could see some result. Moreover,their final achievement of arhatship through the merit of generosity was due to the power ofabsolute nonattachment in the event of giving, with no selfish thought of any personalbenefit, and quite without attachment to the gift as a material object.Generosity, moral discipline, meditative patience, constant perseverance, equanimousconcentration, insight into the empty selflessness inherent in every thought—the merit ofthese is the unfailing cause of the attainment of the most excellent and the very highestquality of buddha, and so we train in it.3.14 ADDICTION TO WEALTH LEADS TO SUFFERING Once in the kingdom of Sravasti, India, there was a poor man called “Nyepa.” He had few"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"needs and was content with what he had. One day, by the grace of the gods, he found aprecious stone. His first thought was that he would give the fortune that it represented to thepoorest person in the village. Going from house to house in search of the poorest person, atlast he discovered him at the palace of Selgyel, the king—for the king was the poorest of allrelative to his desires, which were insatiable. Nyepa gave the stone to the king, because, ashe said, the king was the poorest. But the king was unhappy with Nyepa and told him thatthere was no one more powerful, rich, or famous than him in the whole kingdom, so thestone should be given to someone else. Nyepa insisted that since no one in the kingdom hadso little compared to his demands, it was therefore appropriate for the king to have the gem.Nyepa and the king approached the Buddha for a pronouncement on the issue. KingSelgyel narrated the entire incident and what he had said to Nyepa. The Buddha told theking exactly the same thing that Nyepa had told him. The ultimate poverty is insatiabledesire, and the king’s greed, being insatiable, determined that he should have the fortune.As the Buddha taught, the smaller the desire, the greater the contentment: this is crucial forthis life and the next.Consider rich people: most of them have great mental and physical hardship inaccumulating their wealth, and most accumulated it without concern for their health. Theirenjoyment is thereby impaired by disease or sickness, high blood pressure, or a liverproblem. When the doctor tells them that they have only a short time to live, owing to theliver damage, they realize that they must leave their wealth behind, and their sufferingknows no bounds. So it is. We may become rich, but look at the suffering it entails! Wecannot sleep without sleeping tablets, for example, because day and night we are obsessedwith increasing our wealth and protecting it. Is there any happiness or any benefit inwealth? A healthy body and mind provide much more happiness than the possession ofwealth. Actually, the purpose of power and wealth is a healthy body and mind, and ifsickness and stress for the sake of wealth and fame intervene, then its purpose is undone.Why, anyhow, accumulate wealth if it has to be spent on curing the sickness and recoveringthe lost peace of mind that its accumulation entails?3.15 EVERYONE, HIGH AND LOW, HAS BEEN A SLAVE TO ATTACHMENT It is human nature to lose our freedom through slavery to our attachments. Conversely,whosoever has no attachment is free. This is real freedom. There is no need to demonstratein the street for political change or to litigate in court for human rights, as people do thesedays. What is crucial is the praxis of detachment.In general, people have attachment to three things: money, reputation, and sex. Just lookat the way we become slaves to these attachments. First, for the sake of money, we workhard day and night without resting, and our lives are fraught with tension and anxiety.Consider the way people live in big cities like New York. The speed of the traffic and thenoise are overwhelming. If we examine the lifestyle closely, we find that a building boughtwith a down payment of six or seven hundred thousand dollars entails a payment of at least"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"five thousand dollars a month for the following thirty years. The big car bought with a downpayment is followed by regular payments of five hundred dollars a month for three years. Ifthe monthly fee is not paid regularly, then the car will be confiscated by the company. So,without resting, the people have to work to earn large amounts of money. That makes themlose their nightly sleep and skip holiday breaks. How beautiful the external appearances,but how infinitely anxious the lifestyle! No sleep and not enough leisure to even appreciatethe taste of food! Factories and businesses likewise—outer appearance is not in harmonywith inner actuality.Furthermore, although a family may eat at the same table in the same house, they don’t eatat the same time. What the man eats, and when he eats, is not known by his wife. The timesof the children’s departure for school and their return home and the parents’ departure forwork and their arrival home are all different. When the children leave for school, theparents have already left home. When the parents return home late at night, the children arealready fast asleep. Though they stay together in one house, they can meet only once a week.That is all because of money; it is money that so often creates the chasm between familymembers. Businesspeople and wage earners are all the slaves of money. Capitalism isbasically money-slavery!Second, through attachment to our reputation, we become a slave to it, and we cannot eatproperly or sleep well. When life does not work out according to plan, some peoplecommit suicide; there are many cases that could be recounted. Some die having climbedinto a rocket for adventure; some die for the sake of name and fame trying to climb amountain; some die deep down in the ocean where they dive for adventure. When someonebecomes famous during his lifetime and after his death has his name carved brightly on atall pillar, no doubt it gains attention for a few years. But after a decade or so, the personwill be forgotten, and the pillar will be neglected; his name, carved upon the pillar, will becovered by moss, and weeds will obscure it. Even the statues of national heroes andheroines remain unattended, and bird droppings cover them. We can all see these thingshappening. Our heroes’ and heroines’ fame lasts for only a few years and then slowly fadesaway. To spend life looking for fame is to waste a precious human body as a meaninglessslave to reputation. Also, consider the effect of divorce on reputation, or an abortion thatmust be kept secret to protect reputation. It is all meaningless. In Entering the Way of theBodhisattva, the poet Shantideva says, Spending money to sate desire,Risking life for reputation,What is the point of that?Who will benefit at death? Third, we all know the disasters that attachment to a spouse or consort has wroughtthroughout history. Consider the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan’s madness when his queenMumtaz Mahal died—he built the Taj Mahal. Even the great gurus suffered from this kindof attachment. The rishi Vyasa, who wrote the Ramayana, for example, was deeply"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"attached to a woman of Varanasi named Kashi Koliti. Koliti’s beauty was legendary, and itattracted many men. Vyasa fell under her spell and began an affair with her. Then one daythe kingdom of Kashi was attacked by an enemy kingdom, and for defense the king orderedall the youth of the kingdom to dig pits about ten feet deep in a single day, find a stand-in todo the work, or pay a high fee to avoid so doing. Kashi Koliti could not afford the fine, soshe searched for a substitute to do her digging for her, but she could find no one, and thismade her sad. The rishi Vyasa, knowing her situation, asked her to bring him a spade and ashovel and said he would dig the pit for her. The task had to be finished before sunset, butthe rishi was advanced in age, and, since it looked as if he’d not be able to complete itbefore the sun set, he stopped the sun in its tracks and continued with his work. The kingand people of Kashi knew the time had come for sunset, but they could still see the sun inthe sky. One other rishi knew the situation and guessed that it was Vyasa who had stoppedthe sun to accomplish his task. The king, his ministers, and all the people went to the placewhere the rishi Vyasa was digging, and the king paid homage to him and asked him to stopthe work. The king’s presence embarrassed Vyasa, so he ignored him. Rebuffed, the kingfound out whose work the rishi was doing and then went to see Kashi Koliti to ask her torelease the rishi from his labors. Koliti sent three messengers, one after the other, to askVyasa to stop digging but to no avail, so she went herself, and kicking Vyasa in the head,scolded him for not heeding her messengers. Vyasa, happy that she had come to him herself,ceased his digging, and let the sun set. The moral of the tale: sexual attachment leads tosexual slavery. Look at the great rishi Vyasa who became the menial servant of thecourtesan Kashi Koliti!As the mahasiddha Saraha sings, “Wherever there is attachment, let it go!” If we wish forpermanent happiness and freedom from suffering, we need to eliminate attachment—in sucha way we will benefit this and future lives. If we cannot avoid attachment, looking forhappiness outside while at the same time hoping for eternal happiness is like applyingmedicine on the skin when the disease is in the entrails.It is important to realize that the Dzogchen view eradicates the affliction of attachmentand other emotions that are the cause of suffering. If we cannot apply the Dzogchen teachingjust now, we should at least walk the paths to contentment taught in the Mahayana andVajrayana approaches; then, finally, we may engage in actual Dzogchen. If all we can do ispractice the four common discursive meditations that turn the intellect back upon itself (thatis, meditations on precious human body, impermanence, karmic cause and effect, andsamsaric retribution) in this life, we will be more peaceful and happy. We will be freefrom covetousness, competition, aggression, enmity, and bad intention, and everybody willlove us. We will have less sickness; when we are ill, we will recover quickly; and anyserious chronic disease will not get worse. Some scientists, understanding the closerelationship between body and mind, know that religious conviction can sometimesalleviate sickness. For these reasons, it is very important at all times to try to avoid bothinternal and external attachment."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"3.16 THE STUPIDITY OF SUICIDE These days people who are ignorant of Dzogchen and have no understanding of buddha-dharma regard suffering as real and solid. So everywhere in the world, especially in theWest, some deranged individuals shoot randomly in schools, or in other public places,killing innocent people, and in the end often kill themselves. Such cases create anxiety insociety, particularly, because governments are helpless to prevent such incidents. Thephenomenon of random killing is caused by the frustration of an individual’s personaldesires and aspirations. Intense anger and hatred result, and repeated rejection andfrustration may lead persons to attempt suicide by jumping off a bridge, setting themselveson fire, poisoning themselves, and so forth. But if they choose the way of random killing, inan instant, they terminate lives full of human resource and potential. The mass murder of somany innocent people, which creates sorrow and misery for so many more, is an act ofgreat foolishness. Since the root of the act is jealousy and attachment, we must strive fornonattachment and reflexive release of any attachment as it arises.These days some people maintain that, when their situation becomes insupportable andout of control, suicide will solve the problem. Such thinking is an attempt to escape fromthe suffering of past lives. About such people Sakya Pandita in his Elegant Sayings says, Although they desire only happiness,Fools pursue goals that bring only suffering;Those who are bewitched by devilsAttempt suicide to end their pain. People who have been bewitched by demons attempt suicide by jumping into fire or wateror from a cliff top, says Sakya Pandita, adding that suicide is a grossly foolish act. Peoplewho commit suicide do not come only from the underprivileged classes. It occurs rightacross the social spectrum, including scholars, presidents, and famous performers, andeven the wealthy. In general the cause of all these suicides is a strong attachment to beliefin the real existence of happiness and suffering as externally based and in the true existenceof friends and enemies.When we cannot accomplish our aims and attain the objects of our desires, whenfrustration of our intentions becomes the rule, the possibility of committing suicide comesto mind. Though depression, pain, and anger are the root causes of suicide, in reality theheartfelt suffering or deep depression we endure is like the suffering that arises in a dreamof the death of our beloved only son. If we compare the suffering found in waking anddreaming experience, we cannot find any difference between them. All suffering andhappiness in their own nature are emptiness, but they appear in different ways. Just like arainbow conjured by a magician, these are illusions that possess the mind and that have notrue existence. So no matter what occurs in the mind, pleasure or pain, sickness or health,fame or ignominy, friend, enemy, or beloved partner, understand instantly that what we areexperiencing is just an illusion without any true existence. When our relatives or parents"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"die or we hear the story of a suicide, we need not give ourselves over to grief.According to the Buddhist viewpoint, the karma of suicide is equal to killing the forty-two peaceful deities and fifty-eight wrathful deities that live in our bodies. Consequently,we have to suffer many eons in hell. Even though we are eventually released from hell,because of the previous action of suicide, we will tend to commit suicide many more times.In the great tantra The Rampant Lion, it is said, Whoever takes his own lifeWill suffer suicideIn five hundred further lifetimes;And in this life, all kinds of sufferingWill adventitiously occur. In general, obtaining human birth in the human realm is very rare, and it is even moreunusual to find a human birth with the possibility of hearing the buddha-dharma. In thishuman body it is possible to obtain liberation and buddhahood. As Shantideva said inEntering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Rely upon this human body as a boatTo cross the great river of suffering;Such a boat will be difficult to find in the future. To escape from the great ocean of birth, old age, sickness, and death, there is no better waythan dependence upon the great boat of the human body. The act of putting an end to theprecious human body due to adverse circumstances is very stupid. People who can satisfytheir desires are very few in this world. Even people who have acquired name and famehave to protect their interests constantly, and they, least of all, attain peace. Actually noperson like that is ever contented—it is much better to be satisfied and contented with justwhat we have.3.17 WITH DETACHMENT, THE MERE POSSESSION OF WEALTH AND FAME DOES NO HARM If we are famous or rich and yet have no attachment to anything, we will suffer neitherphysically nor mentally. At the beginning, suffering arises from the manner in which thewealth was accumulated, or from the way in which the fame was attained; in the middle,suffering arises from how these were protected and sustained; and at the end, sufferingarises from ongoing attachment to them. Even if we possess universal wealth or fame, wewill be free of suffering if we can practice nonattachment. If we are free of the root causeof suffering, which is attachment, then we can be like Indrabhuti, Dzogchen yogin and king,for whom it was possible to possess a vast kingdom full of innumerable subjects, enjoyconstant sensual pleasure, and become buddha in one lifetime."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"This depends on the praxis of Dzogchen and nonattachment to view and conduct. If wecan sustain whatever appears as reflexive release, then we will not suffer in the process ofaccumulating and protecting wealth or fame. The root of this praxis is the nonattachment ofpure presence to an object. If we possess such a technique, then we will have a happyfamily, harmony with friends, a liberal mind for every kind of situation, and intelligenceenough for any task. Altruistic motivation and compassion for all beings arises in usnaturally. This is reality. The sole cause of all the skillful means of the bodhisattva’s wayof life—the primal awareness of the nature and diversity of emanation, and the nature andmanner of being of all of our experience—is the strong reflexively liberating conduct that isfree of attachment and clinging.Strong reflexively liberating conduct is the performance of the six perfections of wisdomby body, speech, and mind for the benefit of all sentient beings, with neither hope for returnnor expectation of reward. There is no possibility of self-interested motivation in thatconduct, for it is only for the benefit of other beings, in this life and the next. It is the natureof beings in samsara on the other hand to be self-interested and to act “altruistically” onlyout of that self-interest.Once when I was in Hong Kong my patron took me to a famous restaurant for dinner. Themanners of the staff in the restaurant were exemplary in courtesy from the moment weentered, on through the meal, and up to our departure. I was very impressed by theirmanners, and when we were leaving, I said as much to a monk who was in front of me. Themonk waved toward the cash register and smilingly told me that every expression andgesture of courtesy had a price. Thinking that even such a beautiful enterprise was run on asystem of quid pro quo and of expectation of reward, I was suddenly disgusted by thesituation.In the last century, I believe, families were more harmonious than they are today; therewas more sharing and more courtesy among family members, and everyone had greater trustin karmic cause and effect. These days people are not so polite and benevolent, and theirrelationships are more self-centered in regard to the care of children, cooperation betweenfriends, respect of children for their parents, and love between couples. “What is in it forme?” is what we think before we do anything for anybody. Our relationships therebybecome simply exercises in diplomacy, which is good neither for ourselves nor others,because self-motivated love for friends, parents, children, and so forth, is not a firm andstable love. Generally, all phenomena are impermanent, and, furthermore, in this twenty-first century, every day things change drastically. If I am a person who believes in rebirthand wishes to have happiness in mind and body in this life, it is necessary for me to bebenevolent. If I do not believe in rebirth, over the course of time it is impossible that myemotional afflictions—desire, hatred, and pride—will not increase. Due to this I begin tohate others and to create more suffering for everyone, myself included. If only we could allcare for each other without self-interest, everything would be perfect!"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"3.18 OTHERS ARE SERVED BEST BY AN UNSELFISH MIND If we have the pure intention of the compassionate luminous mind to benefit others, now orin the long run, without self-interest, it is of great benefit in this life and the next, and in thislife we will be happy. As Ju Mipham says in his Traditional Shastra, A steward who is grossly selfish,Even if he becomes a leaderEventually falls, like water over a high cliff. Even if selfish persons are appointed to a high position, due to their selfishness, they willfall so low that they will be treated as less than a human being. But again in the TraditionalShastra, A man with an altruistic mind,Who takes responsibility for othersEven if at first he is a servant,Slowly rises up,Like a dragon flying up into the sky. When we benefit others, even if we are like servants, gradually, more and more peopleregard us highly, and we can become leaders of men. This is the result of an altruistic mindand freedom from selfishness. So it is better to think how we can benefit others rather thanhow we can benefit from them. This will provide a good environment, and there will beharmony among parents, relatives, friends, countries, and so on. It can make this twenty-first-century world a happier place to live.Consider this story of Upagupta from the Vinaya. There was once a woman in the city ofVaranasi in India who was beautiful like a goddess, and her song and dance charmedeveryone, including the king, nobles, and ministers. As time passed, she gained power andwealth, and the king and ministers happily obeyed her in her every whim. Due to herposition as a courtesan, sometimes she had to sleep with them, but she herself was notinterested in sex. One day, in front of the palace, she set eyes on the monk called“Upagupta” and became so attracted to him that she would watch him every day as hepassed by the palace. Even though she tried for several days to attract his attention, shefailed to draw even a glance. She tried many methods to pull his attention to her, but allwere in vain. This only increased her interest. One day she waited for him at thecrossroads, and when he came by, she invited him to visit her house for alms, but herefused her request. Her attachment grew in intensity until one day she lost control andtouched him, again requesting that he visit her. The monk replied that though he had no needto visit her, he would come later. And they parted. Her attachment to him remained, butseveral years went by in which she was still fully engaged in her work, mesmerizing peoplewith her dance and song. But one day she caught the dreaded disease of leprosy and, her"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"mouth and nose being eaten away, very quickly lost her beauty. Finally her friends andrelatives no longer visited her, and she found herself alone in the cremation ground,deprived of the last bit of her wealth, and there she remained. One night, when she was leftwith no food to eat or clothes to wear, she felt so thirsty that she cried out for water, butthere was no one to hear her. She was tired of this life and so sad. Just then she heardsomeone approaching, a man who had come to give her water to drink, and she feltrestored. She asked him who he was. “I am the monk Upagupta,” came the reply. She askedhim why he had not come to visit her in her youth but waited until this sad moment to seeher. “In the past your beauty and charm attracted many friends, and you had no need of me,”he replied. “Now there is no one to look after you, so I have come.” She was touched by hisaffection and tears filled her eyes.The monk Upagupta was not interested in her voice or her beauty, but later, when shewas diseased, he came to visit her. The king, ministers, and others who were attached toher beauty shunned her when she lost it. The moral of this story is that compassion and analtruistic mind free of self-interest is supreme, while self-motivated kindness generated byego is self-destructive.The compassionate luminous mind is without attachment and benefits all. If we aredetached from the view and conduct, then steady love and compassion arise for all—forparents, relatives, friends, and whole countries—and there would be harmony in everydirection.Another story: once when a mother and daughter went to bathe in a river, they were bothcarried away by a sudden strong current. The daughter thought, “I don’t mind dying if Icould save my mother!” And the mother thought, “If I could only save my daughter, I don’tmind dying!” Due to their good intentions, the gods praised them, and both of them werereborn in heaven.Liberation and omniscience are the unfailing cause establishing the absence of self-interest that benefits others. It is impossible to attain that absence of self-interest withoutabiding in emptiness and sustaining the conduct of reflexive release. Ordinary beingscannot perform the conduct of the noble ones, whose actions are not mixed with self-interest. Whatever ordinary beings do, there is some self-interest involved, either directlyor indirectly. Some act out of greed and some out of pride, and we can see this with ourown eyes. If we have the Dzogchen view so that whatsoever appears is reflexivelyreleased, then mean or coarse emotions, such as hatred of enemies or desire for friends,will not arise. If we can meditate and practice the conduct of allowing thoughts to beliberated reflexively again and again, then subtle self-motivated thoughts will not ariselater.If we want to make some great beneficial difference to this world, first we have tosustain the conduct of reflexive release of whatever arises on the path of nondesire andnonattachment. Then to engage in the great wave of selfless action for the sake of others is agreat joy."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"3.19 WHEN WE KNOW OBJECTS OF ATTACHMENT AS DELUSION, THE FIVE SENSORYPLEASURES DO US NO HARM If at present we detach ourselves from our home, wealth, relatives, reputation, and so on,just by this detachment we will suffer less. Consider the Sahor king, Indrabhuti, whoinvited Padmasambhava from Sindu, adopted him as his son, and gave him royal power andfive hundred beautiful princesses. Padmasambhava taught buddha-dharma to the people ofSahor, but one day, realizing that religion and politics do not mix, he decided to abandonthe life of the palace. Sure that the king, his adoptive father, would object, he conceived astratagem. In the middle of a crowded market place, he took off his clothes and, nakedexcept for bone ornaments around his body, went dancing, holding a staff and a damaru.Coming close to a minister’s son, whose reputation was particularly questionable, hepretended to trip, and his iron staff pierced the boy’s body, killing him on the spot. Thisincident of murder was reported to the king, and in order that the law should be respectedby the people in the future, he decided to punish Padmasambhava. The king knew his sonwell, but to pacify the people and ministers, he called a meeting to discuss how to punishhim. At the meeting some suggested that he should receive capital punishment byimpalement; some that he should be imprisoned; while others suggested exile. After themeeting, the king met Padmasambhava secretly and asked him which of the threepunishments he preferred. Padmasambhava replied, “I have no attachment to the kingdom,so I do not fear banishment. There is neither birth nor death, so I can endure impalement. Ihave broken the law of the kingdom, and I prefer exile. Please don’t worry, father. We havea karmic relation, and we will meet later.”Padmasambhava had no fear of horrible places infested with snakes, wild beasts,demons, and so forth, or any place of unbearable heat. Because he was fearless, he couldbe exiled without danger. Since birth and death are just labels, and they have no substantialexistence, he was not afraid of dying.I’ll do whatever my father and mother prefer,” he said. “But I would like to go to thecremation ground of Sosaling to practice tantra. I prefer to be exiled to a far-awaykingdom.”The king told the assembly of ministers and people that he was going to expelPadmasambhava to the charnel ground of Sosaling. And so it came about. While he wasthere, he was accompanied by thousands of dakinis and performed great benefit to manymen, half-men, and spirits.Where did Padmasambhava’s fearlessness of death and banishment come from? It arosefrom nonattachment to whatever arose and from the realization that all experience is like adrawing on water, a continuity of simultaneous self-arising and self-release.Those great meditators and yogins unable to sustain the actions of body, speech, andmind as reflexively liberating nonreferential conduct are referred to by Patrul Rinpoche inhis The Three Incisive Precepts, Knowing meditation but not release,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Isn’t that the divine trance of the gods? When we engage in rigorous meditation with fixation of mind, we will be released fromsuffering for a while. But when we arise from that meditation, suffering will again followus like a shadow. This is the fault of not knowing the manner of release.Patrul Rinpoche says in his Collected Fragments, In short, resting completely in whatever arises, there is no need of any antidotalpractice. Totally relaxed, gaze into whatever arises, and clear and pure presence willoccur naturally. There is no need to ask for confirmation from outside becauseconfirmation will arise confidently from within. This inseparable view of meditationand conduct is called “The River Flow Training of the Great Perfection.” 3.20 THOSE WITH PURE PRESENCE ARE LABELED “BUDDHA,” WHILE THE IGNORANT ARE“SENTIENT BEINGS” The thick darkness of eons that enshroud the threefold world is illuminated by the sun ofprimal awareness in a second, and the naturally clear and self-abiding dharmakaya mindinvoluntarily arises. This gives us deep confidence in the difference between buddha andsentient beings. Repeating that well-known line from Longchenpa’s The Treasury of theDharmadhatu, “Simple recognition of the nature of being is called ‘Buddha.’” Recognitionof the nature of mind is buddha; in the absence of that recognition, we remain deluded“sentient beings.” That is how we distinguish between buddha and sentient beings. Thecause of all delusion is attachment, and the secret key of all the sutras and tantras isnonattachment, although the ways in which sutra and tantra deal with attachment are as farapart as the earth is from the sky. Further, Dzogchen goes beyond the arena of meritlesspeople with small minds. As it is said in the tantra Recitation of the Names of Manjushri, Instantaneous alienation,But also instantaneous buddha! Once the profound view is accomplished, we may attain buddha, like king Indrabhuti. Ifon this path we fail to fully attain buddha in this life, we will certainly have happinesswhile we live, and we will be certain to attain buddha in the next. This path is the source ofhappiness in this and in every life, so it should be everyone’s path! The attainment ofbuddha is ultimate happiness.In The Dakini’s Heart-Essence, Longchenpa says, The difference between buddhas and sentient beings is the difference betweenhappiness and suffering. The bliss that arises in the dharmakaya is called “buddha.”"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Not recognizing the bliss and being stuck in the delusion of grasping at materiality iscalled “suffering.” He who knows the joy and happiness of body, speech, and mindand the empty bliss of the dharmakaya is called “buddha.” If anguished suffering andausterity is regarded as buddha, then hungry ghosts and the devils of hell are buddha. Itis certain that those who are not free from suffering and are not happy are not buddha.This is an essential point. So long as there is intellectual mind, we are caught in dualistic perception; when withno-mind we are free of that inner dualism, there is intrinsic awareness.3.21 THREE SPECIAL FEATURES OF INTRINSIC AWARENESS In The Most Secret Essence of the Dakini, Longchenpa lists: The secret precept not received in transmission;The buddha not originating in the mind;The result not generated by a cause. The primordial dharmakaya Buddha Samantabhadra, who cannot be found in either samsaraor nirvana, is reflexively released in self-recognition of basic pure presence beyond anyneed of the intervention of an external guide. The pure presence that was not knownpreviously is not a function of the lama or the Buddha’s prediction but rather it arises afreshwith intrinsic awareness. Thus it is the oral instruction that is not received by transmission.All the buddhas of the past, present, and future are primordially free of the labelingfunction of the intellectual mind, and, since they are free of the eight types of consciousness,they never experience delusory samsara. They recognize pure presence through reflexiverelease and thus they are the buddhas not originating in mind.All experience of the external universal container and the internal lives of sentient beingsdepends upon negative causes and conditions derived from the habitual tendencies inherentin nominal delusion, and so, in reality, this experience is not as it appears. On the otherhand, intrinsic awareness is the essence of the dharmakaya, forever untouched by thehabitual tendencies emanating from nominal delusion. It does not depend as much as ahair’s breadth upon the meritorious two accumulations and traversing the path of liberation.In the knowledge of basic natural perfection, pure presence is reflexively released and thusis a result not generated from a cause.3.22 DISCURSIVE THOUGHT NECESSARILY DISSOLVES INTO BASIC PURE PRESENCE Until we realize that intrinsic awareness is already present, we must understand thatstriving to generate that awareness is a wrong path. If we wonder how effortless self-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"arising awareness is practiced, look at this: during formal and informal contemplation, nomatter what outer object of the five senses arises and no matter what afflictive inner thoughtarises, at the moment of its arising sustain that space without modification, and it willrelease itself as it arises, just like a drawing on water. What is self-arising and self-releasing will not abide for a second moment, but will just disappear like a line drawn inwater or a snake’s coil unwinding. There is no need of any antidote to the dualisticperception because it releases into the dharmakaya, just as it is. In The Three IncisivePrecepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, Spontaneous arising and release are incessant;Whatever occurs nourishes naked empty presence;Whatever moves is the creativity of sovereign pure being.It is traceless natural purity—amazing! When thought arises, if we recognize its arising without following it, that itself is the cruxof liberation, and the thought will not touch the meditation but rather intensify it. As it issaid, “The more thoughts, the more dharmakaya.”In the sutra The Pile of Jewels, it is said, Kashyap, it is like this: just as the one who is protected by mantra and medicine cannotbe harmed by poison, so the bodhisattva who possesses wisdom and skillful meanscannot be harmed even by the poisons of emotional affliction. Poison can do no harmto those people who recite mantra, and bodhisattvas who possess wisdom cannot bedeceived by emotivity. Kashyap, it is like this: The excrement of the big city isvaluable for sugarcane fields and grape fields, and, Kashyap, the fertilizer of thebodhisattva’s emotional affliction benefits buddha-dharma. Just as the excretion of thebig city is useful as fertilizer in sugarcane fields, so the emotional afflictions of thebodhisattvas are beneficial to Buddha’s teaching. In luminous mind, emotion can be taken as an enhancement, and with the Dzogchen view,there is no need to speak more. In the tantra The Lamp of the Three Modes, it is said, In one single clear meaning, no ignorance;Many skillful means, no difficulty;With the power of a sharp mind,The path of tantra is best! In that way thought helps rather than harms the yogin. As the rigzin Garab Dorje says, asquoted by Longchenpa in The Heart-Essence of Vimalamitra, In pure timeless spaciousness,Momentary attention to adventitious pure presence,"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Like a jewel recovered from the ocean depths,The dharmakaya is not created or modified by anyone.

One day he invited his Hindu priests to the palace and asked them how hecould become even more powerful and famous. The priests advised him that he hadaccomplished most of the things that needed to be done, but if he yearned for still greaterfame, he should build ten thousand stupas and sacrifice human beings at each. The king,agreeing to this plan, went to the borders of his empire and ordered the construction of abeautiful temple. He then appointed a priest to take care of the temple, ordering him to killany person who might visit. The priest began his duty of sacrificing the devotees who cameto visit the temple, and when the number of sacrificial victims had reached five thousand, amonk, a disciple of the arhat Kriti, who had reached the stage of the path of training,happened to present himself there. The priest caught him and was about to kill him, but themonk, surprised by the priest’s intention, asked him why he wanted to kill him. The priestthen told him the story of the temple. After hearing this, the monk begged the priest for aweek’s reprieve while he stayed at the temple, and after a week, he could kill him or not, ashe wished. So the priest let him go free for a week.The monk was about to attain arhatship, and for a week, constantly absorbed in single-pointed samadhi, he did not sleep. On the morning of the last day of that week, he attainedarhatship, with foreknowledge and the power of creating miracles, and he awaited thepriest, who indeed came to fetch him to take him to the sacrifice. The monk submitted,offering his breast to the sword, and the priest tried hard to kill him, but the sword wouldnot penetrate the monk’s body. The sword having failed, the priest tried fire and boiling oil,but to no avail. By the end, the monk had become even more imposing than before, and thepriest went off to report to the king.King Ashoka with his many ministers came to see the monk, and the arhat showed greatmiracles, awakening deep devotion in all toward him. That is how king Ashoka came toembrace buddha-dharma. The arhat gave the king deep teaching, and told him particularlyof the immorality of human sacrifice. The king felt remorse and asked how he shouldconfess his misdeeds. The arhat told him that he could not tell him how to atone for his sins,but that he should visit his own teacher, the arhat Kriti, who surely knew the method.The king went to see the arhat Kriti and told him the whole story about the temple, and,feeling deep remorse for his misdeeds, he told Kriti he wanted to make confession. ArhatKriti told him to dig up two kilos of buddha relics from Rajgriha, build a stupa, and fill itwith them."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Ashoka did as the arhat Kriti suggested. When he dug out the relics, he found a copperplate with an inscription prophesying that a poor person would be the one to dig them upand, having dug them up, would dig further. The king thought that since he was wealthy itwas not his place to dig up more relics, and he went to confer with the arhat Kriti. ArhatKriti told him that it was indeed Ashoka himself who was indicated in the inscription. Todeflate the pride of such a king, a copper plate had been engraved with the mention of apoor king on it. The arhat taught him, saying, “O king! Even a huge mountain can be washedinto the sea, what then of your little kingdom? So he went again to that spot and dug up morerelics until he possessed a treasure trove of forty kilos, which included innumerableprecious stones. Seeing those enormous riches, the king’s pride diminished, and he took therelics and ordered many stupas to be constructed around his kingdom. Some historians sayhe built ten million stupas, but generally it is believed that he built eighty-four thousand. Healso served millions of Buddhist monks, and because of his great service to buddha-dharma, it prevailed for three more centuries in India. Later, with the Hindu resurgence andthe Muslim conquest of India, buddha-dharma gradually declined.Supreme virtue is that untouched by any reference to act, agent, or object. Take theexample of generosity: the act of giving can lead to nirvana and buddha only if performedwithout attachment to the action of giving, without attachment to the recipient, and withoutattachment to the gift itself. Likewise, in order to live a moral lifestyle, we should practicemorality untouched by any reference to act, agent, or object. This is the root of buddha-dharma. If engaged in morality with attachment, even an otherwise pure monk cannot attainnirvana and buddha. In Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Shantideva says, The root of buddha-dharma is the monk,But the path of the monk is very difficult;And because of mental fixation,Nirvana is very difficult to attain. If we have attachment to samsaric activity, of course we cannot attain anything, but if wehave attachment to the conduct of the six perfections, which is a certain path to nirvana, wewill lose our way. Due to the propensity to become attached to samsara, nirvana, and thepath between them, such instruction is said to be on a lower level than the provision ofsutras and tantras that teach the definitive truth, and, particularly, these lesser instructionsare inferior to Dzogchen. The tendency to establish samsara as what must be rejected andnirvana as what must be attained, and to follow this, considering it a true path, is a point oftemptation to be avoided on the effortless Dzogchen path. Samsara, nirvana, the path, or anyreference point whatsoever, cannot help but vanish into itself, reflexively released, like amagician’s illusion. This is the special Dzogchen teaching.3.24 “HAND-HOLDING” INSTRUCTION, IN SHORT"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The following is extracted from Longchenpa’s The Most Secret Essence of the Lama: To sustain informal contemplation experience, first, in formal contemplation, hangloosely, relaxed, with open, natural clarity, without labeling and without anyattachment to the primal awareness of naked empty presence. Without reifying the formin the eye, the sound in the ear, the taste on the tongue, the sensation in the body, or thehosts of positive or negative thoughts in the mind—the six kinds of phenomena—withopen cognition, know pure presence. Without following or running after the object, intranslucence, experiencing forms that are without hope or fear, without modification oradulteration, without rejecting appearance, they are released by themselves. The mindthat apprehends apparent objects is in this way reflexively released, and there isnonduality of subject and object.The purified eye is a god’s eye, without obscuration, so that, for example, walls,fences, mountains, and so on, appear transparent. The ears can hear the voices of thegods and the nagas, for instance, regardless of whether they shout or whisper. Thenose has a vast range of smell, larger than the human range. The tongue without eatingcan taste the hundreds of tastes of concentrated absorption. The body can feel the heatof clarity and bliss and primal awareness. The mind can remember our own manylives and see those of others, and is clairvoyant. That is our conduct when all iscompletely undefiled.No matter what appears in informal contemplation, the gap between meditationsessions should be understood to be like one of the eight metaphors of magicalillusion; and thereby we are released from desire, hatred, and all emotional affliction.When positive or negative mental display arises, convinced that it is without root orbase, neither fixate upon it nor reject it.While the ego still has not dissolved into its inner spaciousness, meditate accordingto the profound instruction, abide by the law of karma, and through devotion and purevision, do not let the notion of sin or error stain the mind. Stay alone in solitude,keeping the sutric commitments and vows. Without distraction and frivolity, dependupon renunciation. Without desire, without forming attachments, walk the path ofselflessness. Keep death in mind and keep the fires of exertion burning. Day and night,consumed by meritorious activities, abandon the concerns of this life. Serve the rigzin-lama and pray devotedly to him. Remain without any ambition or goal and stay innonaction. Abandon the distinction between oneself and others and eradicate fear andhope. Take misfortune as the path and visualize all appearances as the lama.Understanding that all experience is one’s own envisionment, get rid of egoisticclinging. Since everything is without substance, sustain the joke of the absurd.Understanding primordial emptiness and adventitious emptiness, everything alwaysarises as one’s own envisionment. Through such conduct, by such means, practice dayand night.So long as mental conditions allow, optimize the creativity of pure presence. Stay ina place of solitude. As long as we still make judgments and hold to them adamantly, as"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"long as virtue and vice are still distinguishable, we must familiarize ourselves withnonduality. When there is apparent conflict, turn the argument upside down and look atinherent pure presence. When there is fear of birth and death, we familiarize ourselveswith the meaning of birthlessness. In that manner all internal and external phenomenaarise as dharmakaya, and we reside in the yoga of nonmeditation that is like the flowof a river. In both sutra and tantra what needs to be abandoned are the shackles of concepts and theshackles of attachment. But their manner of doing so is different, as explained above. Somewill run away from the poisonous tree, some will try to cut it at its root, and some will takeits fruit as medicine. The method of Dzogchen yogins and yoginis is to allow everyemotional affliction at the moment of its arising to dissolve into its own natural state ofbeing. There is no attempt to turn the affliction into something positive or to neutralize it byapplication of antidotes. Over time, through familiarization with the methods of Dzogchen,whatever thought a yogin might have arises as the meditation; but from outside, from thepoint of view of ordinary beings, the appearance of the fear of suffering and the hope forhappiness seems no different. Unlike Dzogchen yogins, ordinary people turn these into solidentities, cultivating them or rejecting them, thus accumulating karma. For the yogin oryogini, whatever appears is released in the very moment of its appearing, so there is neverany opportunity to become attached to it. At first, simply by knowing the thought, it isreleased, just like meeting a long lost friend. In the middle, the thought releases itself, justlike a snake unwinding its coil. At the end, the thought releases without help or harm, justlike a thief entering an empty house. To comprehend the manner of release is crucial. If weunderstand the manner of release, we will be free of the bonds of a dualistic mind.When we venture into the kingdom of gold, we will find nothing but golden stones; justso, no matter what emotionally adulterated thoughts arise, they are all just objects ofmeditation. Even if we look for some substantial delusions or material objects, we will notfind them. At all times and in all situations the sole practice is the reflexive release ofwhatever arises, and, as the main practice, it is imperative to scrutinize whatever appears.The person who has such a practice is certain to be released in the bardo of this birth, thebardo of the death process, the bardo of reality, or the bardo of rebirth. And besides, wecan live in harmony with our friends, relatives, parents, and all living creatures. AsDudjom Rinpoche says in Calling the Lama from Afar, “Whoever is friendly and happy, heis a heart-son of Padmasambhava.”On the basis of such practice of formal contemplation and informal contemplation, thegreat rigzin Garab Dorje and the other seven great rigzin, the eighty great siddhas of India,Padmasambhava and the twenty-five, king and subjects, and the eighty great drubtop ofYerpa attained buddha."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"4. The Attainment 4.1 THE SPONTANEOUS MANIFESTATION OF BUDDHA-POTENTIAL IN BASIC PURE PRESENCE PROPERLY ESTABLISHING the view of natural perfection on the path of the natural greatperfection, we rest—we hang loosely—in all-embracing primordial alpha-purity. Byattesting the key point of the practice—that through reflexive release of whatever arises ininformal contemplation we arrive at the one taste of formal and informal contemplation—the propensity toward dualistic appearance and its most subtle tendencies dissolve, andintrinsic awareness is revealed as timeless buddha. It is not that through engaging in thepractice of meditation as the path that the nature of pure being and primal awareness ofbuddha, not present previously, are suddenly newly created and thereafter recreated inevery moment. Rather, the adventitious obscuring concepts of mind and mental eventsarising with dualistic perception in the presence of naturally abiding primal awarenessdissolve in their own spaciousness. At that time, the buddha-potential of basic purepresence shines forth spontaneously, and it is irrelevant whether “the nature of mind isrevealed as ‘buddha’” or “buddha-nature manifests in sentient beings.”In The Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, Longchenpa says, If we gain familiarity with the luminous essence,The luminous spontaneity of things,Through the key precept of nonstriving and effortlessnessAnother buddha awakens in the timeless buddhaAnd that is the actuality of the peerless vajra-heart. In the spontaneity of intrinsic awareness, arise the five dimensions of being, the fivemodes of primal awareness, and the rest of the twenty-five aspects of buddha-potential infruition, manifesting naturally. Thereby, like the reflection of the moon appearing inlimitless buckets of water, limitless compassion arises as the display of all beings of thesix realms of the ten directions. So long as samsara exists, buddha activity fulfills therequirements of all beings according to their needs and continuously and precisely showsprofound and broad physical, energetic, and mental dynamism—the movement of manifestbuddha-potential. The reason for such activities is mentioned by Ju Mipham in Beacon ofCertainty: This body of form, the apparent aspect,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Protects all beingsWith its potential for happiness:Thus ultimately its nature is compassion. Out of the natural uncrystallizing radiance of intrinsic awareness, the apparent aspect (thesambhogakaya and so forth, arising as the rupakaya with its major and minor marks) isitself compassionate in nature; thus through effortless spontaneity, all sentient beings gainbenefit of both temporal boons and ultimate happiness so long as the world exists. As tothis luminous aspect of the rupakaya: all its unbounded activities lead to the great fruition ofspontaneity and impartially and continuously protect all beings, pure and impure, from allthe troubles and crises of samsara.If we speak from the perspective of the dimension of being that is the outer container andthe inner awareness therein contained, those dimensions of being are classified as thedharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, unchangeable vajrakaya, and the bodhikaya ofmanifest enlightenment. The modes of primal awareness that they contain are the awarenessof spaciousness, mirrorlike awareness, awareness of equality, discriminating awareness,and all-accomplishing awareness. These many tabulations have been mentioned briefly inthe section on view above. Please look at it!In the tantra The Supreme Source it is said, All buddhas of the pastTaught only what our own mind is;Keeping it just as it is, without alteration,No discursive thought in samadhi,A silent mind is the accomplishment.Present and future buddhas will establish the same—Thought-free sameness. According to this approach, the nature of mind itself is great reflexive release right from thebeginning, and the recognition of it is called “pure presence.” By sustaining thatrecognition, with a strong impetus, we will attain buddha much faster than on other paths.With intrinsic awareness as the ground and the four modes of freely resting [chokzhak] inCutting Through as the path, if we attain constancy in confident self-expression, buddha isrealized. If we take the sitting postures and fixed gazes of Direct Crossing as the path,accomplishing the four visions is the budha mode. In The Golden Letters, Longchenpa says Through the manifest vision of reality,The intellectual view dissolves;Just as the intensity of the vision increases,Primordial bardo awareness manifests;As the vision of pure presence reaches optimal measure,The sambhogakaya matures;"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"When the reality of appearances is consummate,The fruition of action-free Dzogchen is attained.If we gain perfection in the ground like that,There is no need to look elsewhere for nirvana.4.2 KNOWING THE GREAT PERFECTION: BUDDHA IN ONE LIFETIME! In The Three Incisive Precepts, Patrul Rinpoche says, Vision is Longchen Rabjam, the All-Pervasive Matrix;Meditation is Khyentse Wozer, Radiance of Wisdom and Love;Action is Gyelwai Nyugu, the Aspiring Buddha.In the experience of such vision, meditation, and action,Without stress or strain, we attain buddha in this lifetime. Possessing the keys of view, meditation, and conduct, it is certain that if we do not attainbuddha within this lifetime, at the worst we will attain buddha within three or seven moreincarnations.In the past, the great rigzin Garab Dorje, his disciple Jampel Shenyen, his disciple SriSingha, his disciples Padmasambhava, Yeshe Tsogyel, and others have attained therainbow body in Tibet, while many hundreds like Pang Mipham Gonpo, Nyelam JangchubGyeltsen, Nyangben Tingdzin Zangpo, and others have attained ordinary buddha. Fromthose days until now, Direct Crossing in the great perfection has produced a rainbow bodyand Cutting Through has vaporized the body into invisible atoms. These manifestationshave been seen in the past, will be seen in the future, and are being seen in actuality in thepresent on the path of the Heart-Essence of the Great Perfection.In the tantra The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva, it is said, “There are two kinds ofnirvana: immaculate buddha and manifest immaculate buddha.” Immaculate buddha is theattainment of a body of light or a rainbow body without leaving any trace. With theattainment of a manifest immaculate buddha, phenomena of light, sound, relics, body, orearth tremor occur. The great and famous Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, who gained therainbow body, is an example of the former, and the omniscient Longchen Rabjampa, whosedeath was attended by many and various miraculous phenomena, is an example of the latter.Let me speak briefly about the attainment of manifest immaculate buddha by Longchenpa:one day, after having reached the age of fifty-six without a day of sickness, while GyelseZopa was writing down whatever he spoke, Longchenpa made a paper tube and spokethrough it into Gyelse Zopa’s ear, saying, “Now I, Pema Ledrel Tsel, will stay no longer. Iwill go to the place of great bliss and deathlessness. The strength of my prayers, my life,and my karma is exhausted.” In such a manner, he foresaw his own death. Then, in thetwelfth month of that year, at Samye Chimpu, he asked Acharya Kunga Pel and others firstto make a great offering of desirable objects to the triple gem and then to wait outside the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"room. They begged him to let them stay inside, to which he acquiesced. “I am nowabandoning this apparitional body,” he told them. “You all sit in silent and fearlessmeditation.” In the tantra The Union of Sun and Moon, it is said, “At that time obey theinstructions of the lama.” Like that, Longchenpa, while sitting with the fixed gaze of thedharmakaya, was gathered into the matrix of alpha-purity and spaciousness. At that time,just as with the passing away of Shakyamuni Buddha, the virtuous gods could not bear theirgrief and shook the earth, and Longchenpa’s body moved in accordance with the shaking ofthe earth, and a great cry of sorrow was heard. As for the offerings to him, a rain of flowersshowered down, and tents of rainbows appeared, and furthermore there appeared manyamazing signs of rainbow light and light-spots in the sky. As it is said in the tantra TheBlazing Relics, There are three types of lights: first, an encircling light in the environs indicates thatno matter where he has come from, he will certainly attain fruition in the first bardo;second, if the light rises straight upward, he will not go into the bardo at all but in amoment will attain buddha; third, if the light appears from his body at a tangent, hewill attain enlightenment in the final bardo. Furthermore, the sign that the internal light had been captured was that the body, surroundedand suffused by the fragrances of camphor, saffron, and sandal remained for twenty-fivedays without losing its radiance. A sign that his mind was released into reality was anirregularity of the four seasons and random manifestations of the elements: in the coldnessof the twelfth and first months of the year, the ice melted, and leaves grew on the sewabush. Such signs indicated that he had attained the goal of the supreme path of atiyoga:dissolution into the matrix of the Vase Body of Eternal Youth, the consummation ofDzogchen.Four lamas, with the four tantric karmas of pacification, enrichment, control, anddestruction, performed his cremation. The sign that his heart, tongue, and eyes weretransformed into the ringsel relics of the five buddha-families was that the soundsshariram, bariram, churiram, pancaram, nyariram were heard just as an uncountablenumber of relics of the five colors as large as mustard seeds appeared. As “multiplyingrelics,” each of them increased many times through time, as anyone can see these days, andthey became the basis for accumulation of merit.If the questions arise, “Why did the great Longchenpa not attain a body of light after heattained buddha? Why did he leave his corpse behind?” The answer is that he left his bodybehind so that his disciples of that lifetime—and also disciples of the future—couldreceive the great benefit of the “four chances of liberation.” These occur first by eating therelics of the body which remain; second, by eating the salt used to pack the body afterdeath; third, by hearing the crackle of the cremation pyre; and fourth, by voluntarilyallowing the smoke of the cremation pyre to enter the nose. Read Longchenpa’s biography,Doorway of Threefold Faith, for more details."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"4.3 CONTEMPORARY STORIES OF PHYSICAL DISSOLUTION AND LIBERATION IN A RAINBOWBODY Stories such as that of Longchenpa are not found only in the distant past. Recently, onAugust 29, 1998, at Dome Khamngak in Azi Rong in Tibet, Khenpo Choying Rangdrol,commonly known as Khenpo Acho, eighty years of age, attained physical dissolution.Khenpo Acho was a reincarnation of Drokben Kheuchung Lotsawa, as prophesied by thespiritual head of the Nyingma school, Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, and he was the holderof the teaching of Vajrakilaya: The Razor Slash. One day at noon, lying in bed, withouthaving suffered any recent illness, while in the posture of a sleeping lion and reciting thesix-syllable mantra, he attained buddha in the primordial basic matrix of alpha-purity, hisheart of clear light reality perfected beyond the intellect. As his body dissolved into light,his wrinkles vanishing, he seemed like an eight-year-old child with a beautiful complexion.After a week had passed, when people came to know of his death, they performed his deathpuja secretly in order to deceive the authorities, and at that time, rainbows appeared insideand outside, and a pleasant aroma pervaded the place. His body gradually diminished insize, and at the end, he attained buddha; not even his nails and hair were left behind. It wasjust like a bird flying off from a rock—people nearby have no idea where it might havegone.As the tantra has it, quoted in Jigme Lingpa’s Chariot of Omniscience, The yogin freed, like the sun rising at dawn,The dharmakaya appears. Wah! Wah! There have been many such occurrences, like that of Nyang Sherab Jungne at Pukmochein Lhari, whose body dissolved into its subtle composite particles, like mist vanishing inthe morning. Such stories are so common that it is impossible to write them all down.Through the phases of Dzogchen—the alpha-purity of Cutting Through and the spontaneityof Direct Crossing—buddha is accomplished not without cause or condition. If we trainproperly on this path from this time forward, we too can attain dissolution of the body intoits most subtle particles, or indeed, even the rainbow body. Such assertions do not in anyway denigrate buddha-dharma and do not negate common sense or inferential logic as validmeans of cognition, just as scientific assertions regarding motive power, for example, donot damage actual physical traction.Around 1960 in Derge Yelung, Mani Gaygo, Yelungpa Sonam Dorje passed away in arainbow body, testimony about which we can still hear from some of the elders in thatplace. When I was residing in Kham, I went to see the house where Sonam Dorje hadattained the rainbow body. I even had the opportunity of staying there for a few days. Atfirst hand I heard from his niece and nephew how he achieved the rainbow body, and I wasutterly convinced.On the path of the alpha-purity of Cutting Through, Khenpo Acho’s body dissolved intosubtle particles, and on the path of the spontaneity of Direct Crossing, Yelungpa Sonam"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Dorje attained the rainbow body. These two are perhaps the most recent manifestations oftheir respective attainments. Countless rainbow bodies have appeared in India and Tibetsince those of the twenty-five close disciples of Guru Rinpoche, the king Trisong Deutsen,and his twenty-four subjects. These stories can be read in History of the Nyingma Schoolby either Guru Tashi or Dudjom Rinpoche.Further, just as scientists can predict the precise course of the planets, so masters ofDzogchen can predict the time it takes to attain buddha. For example, when Americanscientists at NASA launched a rocket to the planet Mars, they needed to allow for thechange in Mars’ location during the rocket’s course. It was as if the rocket were launchedto the south when Mars was located in the east. Yet the scientists predicted exactly whereMars would be when the approaching rocket was ready to land upon it. They predicted tothe second the exact speed of Mars—an extraordinary feat. Likewise, we can predict howlong it will take on the path of Dzogchen for those of high, middling, and low acumen toattain buddha (six months, three years, and a lifetime, respectively,) and what signs willoccur. Learned and accomplished masters of the past including Khenpo Acho have given usevidence of this."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"5. The Four Bardos 5.1 FOR THOSE OF MIDDLING ACUMEN: INSTRUCTION ABOUT LIBERATION IN THE BARDO IF WE ARE unable to learn through extensive study of the scriptural tradition that holds theprecepts of the Dzogchen view, meditation, and action, there are simple secret Dzogchenprecepts consistent with our varying constitution and powers. Such profound instruction,which is unknown in the lower tantra vehicles, can be manifested by a person who attainsbuddha in a single lifetime. We can read innumerable simple precepts in OmniscientLongchenpa’s The Heart-Essence of Vimalamitra, for example. About this specialDzogchen teaching, which of course is not found in other prosaic sources, MiphamRinpoche in his Beacon of Certainty says, It goes without saying that the special Dzogchen teaching,The practice of simple direct Dzogchen precepts,The extraordinary superior crux, broad and deep,Categorized as mind, space, and secret precept,This Dzogchen with its origin in tantra,Cannot be found in any other scripture. Introducing the nature of mind in accordance with the aspiration of the individual, theway to practice with body, speech, and mind is then shown. This method is unlike ordinarytantra in which the body is visualized as a deity, speech is transformed into mantra, andmind is a samadhi, and neither is it the method of cutting attachment of body, speech, andmind directly as in outer, inner, and secret liberating rushen practices . Rather, itcomprises the sundry precepts concerning substances, consorts, and dark retreat, forinstance, which can give us buddha in one lifetime. Consider the case of the eighty-year-oldMipham Gompo to whom Bairotsana introduced pure presence over a cup of tea, providinghim with a meditation belt and a chin rest, and who then attained a rainbow body andbuddha.So those who hunger for the scriptures containing the precepts of the immediate “hereand now” Dzogchen but are unable to study deeply or extensively should roll over into thevarious secret precepts that facilitate liberation, such as those relating to the bardos.Conventionally there are six bardos. But in the uncommon supreme Dzogchen root tantraBeyond the Sound, four bardos are named: the bardo of life, the bardo of the death process,the bardo of reality, and the bardo of becoming."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"5.2 THE BARDO OF LIFE First, if we fail to recognize the appearances of this life as they emerge from the ground ofbeing as our own primal awareness, it is the fault of “innate ignorance.” When we fail torecognize those appearances as our own envisionment due to the perception of them as“other,” it is the fault of “conditioned ignorance,” “the ignorance of imputation.”Conditioned by the objective fields of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch, we are lost ingross concepts. Through attachment to the five aggregates (name and form, feeling, thoughts,karmic tendencies, and consciousness), we are conditioned by the verbal forms “I” and“mine,” and the notions of “my son,” “my parents,” “my country,” and so on, arise. Thisproduces attachment to one’s own side, hatred toward the other side, and a neutral feelingtoward those in the middle. Such gross delusion cascades like a waterfall over a cliff face,and from beginningless samsara until now, we wander in the six realms of being. If we donot now follow the profound Dzogchen path, it is certain that we will wander continuouslyin this samsara. So we need to understand this bardo of life, search for a rigzin-lama as aspiritual friend, and excel in the common creative and fulfillment stages of vajrayana tantraand in the view of uncommon Dzogchen. Just as it is foolish to venture onto the island ofgold without returning with gold, so having met a rigzin-lama, a rare occurrence, it wouldbe foolish to leave him without first securing the real message of Dzogchen that can give usbuddha in a single lifetime. Likewise, having attained this so-difficult-to-obtain humanbody with its six fortunate qualities, it is foolish not to cultivate the aspiration to use it insome meaningful way.Furthermore, to eradicate skepticism, cynicism, or conditioned prejudice against theDzogchen view, meditation, and conduct in this bardo of life, consider the swallow: amongbirds she is the most excellent nestmaker, building in the most sheltered spot where nodanger from people or other animals threatens. Only when she is free of all uncertainty anddoubt does the bird nestle down. Take this instruction to heart and resolve any skepticismyou may feel regarding the lama’s advice.We should have the conviction of a Shenga Rinpoche as narrated in the story of hisencounter with Guru Rinpoche in the section on view. Here is a similar story. There wasonce a yogin called “Khangkhung Lama Sampa” who, three years into his retreat, contracteda serious disease. It gave him no pain, but one day, because of his weak health, he could notmove. He sent his wife to fetch his dharma friend Lama Pema. When his old friend arrived,Lama Sampa told his wife to go outside the house and asked Lama Pema to recite the prayerknown as “Calling to the Lama from Afar,” adding that there was no way that he could stayin his body any longer. Lama Pema began to recite the prayer melodiously and Lama Samparaised himself a little off the pillow. Halfway through the prayer, he had his spine straight,and his hands placed in the gesture of samadhi. When the prayer was finished, Lama Sampawas dead, but his body had begun to shine, and by his expression, it seemed that he wasabout to speak. Lama Pema went outside to tell the wife that her husband had passed on, butshe did not believe it until, at just that moment, a mass of rainbow light appeared near the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"doorpost. Many people saw the rainbow light, and it became a matter of commondiscussion. Lama Pema is still alive and continues to relate this incident.These days science creates disturbing doubt and skeptical thought. If we have any biasregarding the natural perfection of our basic view, it is very important to eliminate it themoment it arises. There is a Tibetan saying that one wish cannot be accomplished by twominds, and another that says that there can be no stitching with a two-pointed needle.Whatever training we engage in, we must complete and perfect it. This perfection shouldnot be assumed, as in the inferred view of the common Approach with Signs, but rather itshould be perfected through our own experience. Consummate experience depends upon anauthentic rigzin-lama, so we need to search for such a lama, regardless of hardship. If thelama has no realization of the nature of mind, whatever guidance he gives will bemisleading, so be careful in your search for him. Beings of the six realms are deluded in six different ways. Water, for example, isperceived as nectar by the gods, as water for drinking and cleansing by men, as a thirst-quencher by animals, as pus and blood by hungry ghosts, and as blazing fire by the devils ofhell. Since it can be seen differently by different beings, we say that it has no objectivesubstantial existence. In Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, Shantideva said, Who creates the fields of blazing iron?From where do those blazing fires emerge?According to the Buddha,They are created by, and in, sinful minds. When intrinsic presence is enveloped by dualistic perception, each class of being of thesix realms sees things differently, just as a patient with jaundice might see a white-coloredobject, such as a conch, as yellow. In the human realm, envisionment of a life span frombirth until the inevitable disease of death should be understood as a vast lying delusion. Ifwe have some experience in Dzogchen through oral instructions given by a lama, however,then in the bardo of life, we can hold firmly to pure presence and gain release. This is ofvital importance.5.3 THE BARDO OF THE PROCESS OF DYING Acharya Aryadeva is quoted in The Words of My Perfect Teacher as saying, The conditions for death are very many;The conditions for life are very few:Life becomes the condition for death. And so in this present age—to some extent due to climate change—the natural catastrophes"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"of fire, flood, storm, and earthquake occur more than ever before. Thousands of people dieat once in events that seem to occur daily.In 1992, fifteen minutes before it was due to land at Tribhuvan airport in Kathmandu,flight TG 218 crashed into Mt. Bhatidhara. All three hundred people aboard were killed;there were no survivors. None of those three hundred passengers were aware, previously,that he or she was going to die that day. Moreover, the parents and relatives who were atthe airport to meet them were left bewildered and incredulous at the news of the crash onthe mountain. The remains of the plane are still there. The bodies could not be found, gonelike the track of a bird vanishing in the sky. This present body cannot be trusted to continuein its existence indefinitely!Science may have made it easier for us to travel and to live longer, but it has alsocreated more ways to die. Such circumstances, for example, machines contrived from thefour elements, have been created by the developed countries—or rather by greedy peoplein those countries—for short-term benefits, Through their manufacture, there is great dangerthat, by the end of this century, this world will have become uninhabitable by humans andanimals. If we come to such a grave pass, the ways to die will be even more numerous.Furthermore, because of subtle chemical reactions, new diseases now kill peopleirrespective of their gender, social status, or location on the planet. Rather than dying ofnatural karmic causes, people are facing death by these new diseases, weapons of war, andso on, that every day kill on a large scale. People who die in these ways are not withoutparents, relatives, spouse, and friends, but like us they love and are beloved, and they leaveunfinished work behind them.The time of death is uncertain; death waits for no one. It will not look to see whether thechild can yet stand on its own two feet. Death comes all of sudden, like a clap of thunder inthe sky above our heads. At that time, only our training can help; wealth, children, fame,and so forth, will be of no avail. All of that must be left behind. So start now and rememberdeath and the need to engage in training of the mind. We must know about the nature ofdeath so that in the bardo of the death process, we can successfully engage in the modes ofliberation.5.4 THE ACTUAL PRACTICE IN THE BARDO OF THE DEATH PROCESS The bardo of the death process starts when the pain of death attacks us and finishes with thecessation of our breathing. Its duration is variable.The best of us, trusting in pure presence, will think to ourselves, “Now is the time of mycertain death, and I pass into nirvana, into the matrix of simplicity,” and, exhaling long anddeeply, we rest in consciousness without any focus. That is the swiftest way of death, andwe should practice the long and deep exhalation again and again.When death comes to us during that last exhalation of air, yet release does not occur, ifwe have practiced repeatedly beforehand, we visualize pure presence as a white “A” in theheart center that shoots out from the fontanel, opening out into space. Articulating twenty-"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"one white “A” syllables one after the other as they shoot from the heart center up and out ofthe crown of the head, we rest in unfocussed pure presence and gain release.Those who possess such a key instruction as given above need not depend upon thecertain and gradual threefold dissolution of the sense faculties of the body-mind and thevision of pure presence. They attain nirvana by means of the bodhisattva’s method of breathtransference.Those who, when death comes to them, do not have much confidence in such instructionshould know the stages and process of the threefold dissolution. But first let us consider theprocess of generation: during the sexual union of our father and mother, the father’s whiteseed and the mother’s red blood commingle, and, driven by the wind of karma,consciousness enters the embryo. At the outset, the elements’ materiality-producingtendencies of energy, moisture, heat, and air coalesce, creating a body that emerges out ofthe five elements; then, by stages, the gross sensory organs—the eyes and so forth—appear.At the end, at the time of dissolution, it is the five senses that dissolve first. Then thebody separates into the five elements, and each of the five elements dissolves first intoitself and then into oneself. That unity separates into its white and red elements,consciousness separates from them, and the three stages of dissolution, the three visions,occur: the effulgent light of vision, an increasing intensity of the effulgence, and thepenultimate stage of dissolution.Let us first look at the sequence of dissolution of the senses. At the time of our death, ifthere are lamas, monks, relatives, spouse, or friends close by, and if, when we try to heartheir recitation of texts or their talk, we find them inaudible, this indicates cessation of ourauditory sense. Or, perhaps, whatever is spoken cannot be heard because it seems to us asif the words come from very far away. Even though we hear some sound, we cannot makeout the words. Likewise, when we look at things, we no longer see them properly,indicating cessation of our visual sense. In like fashion, our olfactory, gustatory, and tactilesenses cease. This is the sequence of the loss of the external senses.Once when I was at Yelhung, I observed the death process of a woman. She said, “Whatis happening? I cannot see properly.” Then, she said, “Please raise the pillow a littlehigher,” when she was trying to rise up from under the sense of a weight of earth pressingher down. I was witnessing the sequence of the dissolution of the senses and the fourelements. At that time, if there is a guide available, then it is the right time for him to start.If there is someone to perform the consciousness sublimation, then it is also time for that.In The Superrefined Oral Instruction, Pema Lingpa says, As the element earth dissolves into the water element, we feel heavy and cannot stand;as water dissolves into fire, the nose and mouth dry up; as fire dissolves into air, heatis lost; as air dissolves into consciousness, inhalation ceases but exhalation is smooth,and we will feel as if pressed down by a huge weight, engulfed in darkness, or as ifthrown from a cloud: all visions approach with the sound of the whistling wind. When our flesh dissolves into the element earth, and the element earth into the element"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"water, we feel heavy, as if cast into a pit or pressed down by a mountain, and some peoplewill say, “Please pull me up!” or “Raise my pillow!” When blood dissolves into theelement water, and the element water into the element fire, saliva dribbles from mouth andnose. When heat is absorbed into the element fire, and the element fire into the element air,our mouth and nose dry up, and the body loses its warmth. Some people’s fontanel openingleaks a dribble of liquid at that time, which indicates loss of heat. When breath dissolvesinto the element air, and the element air into consciousness, all subtle and gross breath iscollected into the breath of life, and inhalation is difficult. The air is sent from lungs tothroat and gathers there. All the blood of the body gathers in the main artery that supportslife, and three drops of blood strike the heart center, and after three long exhalations,gulped inhalation ceases.At that time the white drop received from our father runs down from the crown chakra tothe heart. The sign of death is like the sky turning the color of the full moon, while internallyconsciousness is quite clear, and the thirty-three thoughts of aversion all cease. That iscalled “the effulgence of vision.” Then the red drop received from the mother runs upwardfrom the navel chakra. The sign of death is a reddish sky as if the sun is setting, whileinternally consciousness is blissed out, and the forty thoughts of desire cease. That is called“the optimal, or increasingly intense, effulgence of vision.” Then consciousness separatesfrom the center of the red and white drops. The sign of death is a clear reddish sky coveredby darkness, while internally consciousness is thought-free, and the seven concepts ofdelusion cease. At that moment we are blind, and we faint away. That is called“penultimate attainment.”Then as we regain some consciousness, the clear light of basic time (which arises at themoment of conception and then again when dying), which is free from the three stages ofdissolution that disturb space, is recognized, and as we rest in meditative absorption,consciousness is transferred to the supreme dharmakaya, and in buddha, one is beyond allbardos.In actuality, when the breath stops and the father’s white seed from the head and themother’s red seed from the navel mingle in the heart chakra, consciousness leaves the bodysimultaneously. If we lack knowledge and familiarity with this process, consciousness willfaint away for a long time. Therefore, during the period of unconsciousness, traditionprovides forty-nine days of the well-known rituals.For those who have had good training, unconsciousness lasts for only a short time, andthen consciousness is absorbed into space. Space is absorbed into clear light or, rather, itclaims the citadel of basic pure presence, where it is released. When our breathing stops,good previous training results first in the complete sequence of effulgence of vision,optimal effulgence, and penultimate attainment, and then, with recognition of the clear lightof the sameness of the ground abiding naturally in itself, we gain liberation.If we can accomplish the view of the unmodified natural great perfection, starting fromthis moment to become familiar with it, by the time of death, with mastery we will passconfidently along on the swift path of Cutting Through, where pure presence and"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"spaciousness, neither separated nor united, provide liberation into the dharmakaya ofsimplicity. That is what contemporary existential yogins call “tukdam,” or the experienceof clear light at the moment of death.The following anecdote illustrates the key point of tukdam. In July 2005, at Mt.Pukmoche in Nepal, there was a great yogin known as Me Me Gyeltsen, who had stayed inretreat all his life. For several months he had had some minor sickness; then one day heasked his friends to invite Tulku Degyel Rinpoche to visit him while he was still able togreet him. They did so, and when Me Me Gyeltsen met Rinpoche, he told him that he hadcompleted his life’s work and requested him to perform the consciousness sublimation.Rinpoche reminded him that he had trained in tantra for his whole life and had met manyauthentic rigzin-lamas during that time, so that he did not need anyone to performconsciousness sublimation for him. “Just pray to those rigzin-lamas,” he told him. “And atthe time of death, don’t forget to continue the yoga in the same way that you have alwaysdone in the past and that will help you.” “Yes, I can induce consciousness sublimationmyself,” Me Me replied. The next day at around 10 o’ clock a monk called “Gendun” cameto visit him and talk for awhile and to make some hot porridge for him. While he wasmaking the porridge, he heard the explosive sound of the syllable PHAT repeated thrice,and upon going inside, he saw Me Me Gyeltsen seated with a straight spine, cross-legged,repeating the syllable again four times but in a small voice. This was during the time of theMaoist insurgency in Nepal, and the Maobadi kept watch even over death ceremonies. Inour neighboring villages of Yangar and Yolwang, they would come to witness a lama’sdeath, and this time they were surprised to see the lama seated upright in cross-leggedposition. They gained some faith in buddha-dharma and praised the yogins who could sitcross-legged in death.In 1959 at Golok Serta in Tibet, Dorje Dadul, the lineage-bearing heart-son of DudjomLingpa, sat cross-legged in the middle of the market square, stared at the sky, loudlyarticulated the syllable PHAT, and died. The incident was seen by many people. Tukdam,or experience of the clear light at death, is occasioned by the mingling of the clear light ofmother and son. By virtue of capturing the citadel of the primordial ground of being, byvirtue of attaining unchangeability on the path of the creative and fulfillment stages, and bygaining freedom from the delusions of the bardo of the death process, the immaculate sign isto be able to remain in the experience of unfabricated body-mind.Moreover, at the instant before death, it is necessary to scrutinize the precepts ascarefully as a dancer examining herself in a mirror, clarifying uncertainties. A lovely ladydressing for a party first puts on her clothes and ornaments flawlessly, then puts on hermakeup, and only after checking herself in the mirror and feeling completely satisfied doesshe confidently leave for the party. Likewise, when we learn consciousness sublimation,first we must practice it until we are fully confident, making sure the inner and outer signsmanifest accordingly. Later, when death comes to us, we apply the practice, in actualitytransferring consciousness to a pure realm. Those who have confidence in consciousnesssublimation are not afraid of death but rather welcome it. The mahayogin Milarepa sang,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" What we call death,That is a small thing for a buddha-yogin. Born into a supreme pure-land and training in what of Dzogchen remains to be practiced,they attain perfect buddha.5.5 CONSCIOUSNESS SUBLIMATION IS AMONG THE FIVE NONMEDITATION METHODS OFATTAINING BUDDHA Just before the time of death, we should clarify anything still unclear regardingconsciousness sublimation, like a dancing girl looking in the mirror. There are four types ofconsciousness sublimation: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya consciousnesssublimation, and ordinary consciousness sublimation comprising the three perceptions.The ordinary consciousness sublimation comprising the three perceptions is to regard thecentral channel as the path, consciousness as the guest who moves on, and the supremebuddha-field of Sukhavati as the destination. We need to train in these three perceptionsuntil inner and outer accomplishments manifest. When death comes, if we have been able tomake our practice a part of our karma, and we are able to transfer our consciousness, weare released from the suffering of samsara and take birth in Sukhavati or some similar placein the supreme realm of nirmanakaya. The precise details of consciousness sublimationpractice can be learned from Pema Lhungtok Gyatso’s commentary on the CuttingInstruction of Dudjom Lingpa.If we are an ordinary person with no experience of the practice of consciousnesssublimation, at the time of death, we should learn the names of the eight successive buddhas(Vipasyin, Sikhin, Vishvabhu, Krakuchanda, Kanakamuni, Kasyapa, Shakyamuni, andMaitreya), the names of the eight sugatas who are the medicine buddhas, and the names ofthe eight bodhisattvas who were the closest heart-sons of the Buddha (Manjushri,Avalokiteshvara, Vajrapani, Kshitigarbha, Nirvaranaviskambin, Akashagarbha, Maitreya,and Samantabhadra). Simply by hearing their names during the bardo of the death process,we shall be freed from the suffering of the lower realms.There is a story that once Sariputra recited the names of the buddhas and their mantrasinto the ear of a dying ox. By the power of mantra, the ox took rebirth as a Brahmin and waslater ordained and received teaching from Shakyamuni Buddha himself before finallyattaining arhatship. Likewise, if dharanis, mantras, and the name of a person’s root lama arerecited at the deathbed of a person, the dying person will obtain great benefit. This shouldbe understood by all.With the sequential dissolution of the senses, the four elements, and then the effulgence ofvision, optimal effulgence, and penultimate attainment, we die in perfect equanimity. Themind faints away, and with consciousness regained, but purified, the light of the groundarises, and its reality is sustained. When the clear light known as “the reality of the natural"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"creativity of pure presence” dissolves, upon its disappearance, the bardo of realitygradually dawns.5.6 THE BARDO OF REALITY The present gross body that contains the ego, produced from our parents’ sperm and blood,is abandoned, and the clear light of the universal visionary display arises in basic purepresence. During this bardo of reality, just as a baby totally trusts its mother while in herlap, so we should trust the instruction that our experience has not the slightest substantialexistence and is in reality the envisionment of clear light. Just as a small child, unable totalk and lost in a big crowd, when later reunited with its mother, climbs confidently andunhesitatingly onto her lap, due to the closeness of their relationship, so the son clear light,which was revealed by the nonmeditation praxis introduced to us by the lama, merges withthe mother clear light of unconditioned, intrinsic, basic pure presence. These two, themother clear light that is the essence and the son clear light that is the natural creativity ofenvisionment in the bardo of reality, are one, like the sun and its light rays, and with thatcertainty, we are like the son climbing onto his mother’s lap. In that instant, the propensitiesof the twin veils induced by dualistic perception from beginningless time are instantlypurified, and we attain buddha without any bardo.If we ask why the basic clear light arises at that time, consider that we have just becomefree from the corpse of gross flesh and blood, and that the eighty concepts relating tovisionary effulgence, optimal effulgence, and penultimate attainment have ceased to arise.At that juncture, therefore, we are free from attachment to the mystical experiences of bliss,clarity, and no-thought. Then recollection through memory and the generator of memory thatis the ground consciousness itself seem to dissolve into space, and intrinsic basic presenceis utterly without limit. Here is freedom from all bias and partiality, and empty clarity, freefrom veiling obscuration, is now recognized as such. Resting loosely in the natural statewithout fabrication, we are powerfully released into the vast inner spaciousness of alpha-purity as the magnificent reality of the spontaneity of the primordially released ground ofbeing.If we are not released at the moment of cessation of inhalation and exhalation, whenexternal objects normally perceptible to our senses become invisible, including our owncorpse body, we must recognize the clarity of our body of light. Our field of perceptionconsists of rainbow light rays; visionary appearances change timelessly so that the animateand inanimate objects such as earth, stone, rock, trees, forest, sun, moon, and so forth,vanish, and wherever we look, we see rainbows—all appearance dazzles with ashimmering radiance. At that time, our degree of training on the Dzogchen paths of CuttingThrough and Direct Crossing determines whether or not we see those light-forms as aliberating catalyst to pure presence. Those who do not have previous experience will see itonly for a moment, just like a flash of lightning. If we can sustain the visions, knowing thateverything is self-envisionment, in the first moment we have trust in the insubstantiality of"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"that envisionment; in the second, we are released as we stand; and in the third, we haveseized the citadel of release. After this, there are no appearances whatsoever.When the clear light becomes part of unitary reality, envisionment naturally dawns as thebuddha-dimension of form, as forms of pure being. Peaceful deities arise from the heartcenter, and “wrathful deities,” a dynamic dimension of envisionment, appear out of theconch-house (the cranium). Spreading into the world of bardo, their size will beunpredictable, large or small. If we do not recognize these visions as self-envisionment,then the light creates fear and the light rays and sounds create panic. If we did notunderstand the point of the guru’s instruction, then failing to recognize the light, light rays,and the sounds, we will wander in samsara.Furthermore, the clusters of male and female deities in union of the five buddha-familiesappear in direct proportion to our training on the paths of Cutting Through and DirectCrossing, and according to the length of time we can remain in concentrated absorption.The mandala assemblies of the deities of the five buddha-families appear from the first dayto the fifth day. If we are unable to sustain those visions, then the visions of the four aspectsof primal awareness, Vajrasattva’s secret caverns, will arise.Those who are not familiar with the Dzogchen path will be unable to recognize thosevisions of the bardo of reality arising out of the ground and sinking into the ground andsuddenly disappearing, like the sun setting over a mountain pass. Those who havefamiliarity with Dzogchen may remain in that space awhile, and deep faith and devotion tothe lama arising, they may evoke him. The lama may appear as the teacher of the self-envisionment that is to be recognized and thus assuaged, and may in this way show us thepath of liberation and the attainment of liberation.5.7 THE BARDO OF BECOMING Consciousness is moved only by wind; it is impeded only by the unchangeable alpha-purityof the vajra-seat and also by the mother’s womb. We cannot be obstructed by earth, rock,mountain, tree trunks, or any other solid object—we can move through everything withouthindrance. In this bardo we have a mental body that is inimical to fleshly forms or materialbodies. Appearances are like dream, existing merely as labels. Through karma we can takepart in incongruous and miraculous events. We can see only those various beings of thebardo similar to ourselves and other samsaric beings; and, possessing the divine eye, weknow the likes and dislikes in the streams of consciousness of still-living beings on theother side.We may hear our parents or children talking or monks reciting texts, but when we try tospeak to those on the other side, they cannot hear our voices, and they do not respond. Wemay then think that everyone hates us, and aversion to them arises. When we are amongthem at the dining table, for example, no one serves us food. Neither the sun nor any otherlight casts our shadow. We leave no footprint in the sand and no imprint of wet feet."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Gradually the realization emerges that we are dead, and deep fear and pain engulf us.We may go to seek refuge among lamas and monks, but we discover that they areperforming false rituals, their samaya vows have been broken and not repaired, and theyignore creative and fulfillment stage training. Especially when we see their avarice, wefeel that they are fooling us and are the agents of the lower realms, and that we willgenerate only wrong views by association with them. The desire to take rebirth soon growsstrong, and we search everywhere for an entrance to a womb. But until the karma of life inthe bardo of becoming is exhausted, there is no possibility of finding that womb.The vision of our death recurs every seven days, and due to the recurrence of the intensesuffering of that event for the dead, the tradition insists on performing death ceremoniesevery week for seven weeks. At that time, we hear the four fearful sounds—rumblinglandslide, billowing ocean, blazing fire, and cyclonic storm. The three poisons (hatred,desire, and jealousy) appear as an abyss of embodiment, and we feel intolerable panic atthe prospect of falling into it. Feelings toward the embodiment of consciousness, with itsimpulsions, conceptualization, and name and form are all felt to be of the nature of intensesuffering. Existence blown by the winds of karma, without an earth, is like a feather blownby the breeze.Consciousness, fickle and misty, is seven times clearer and more alert than before, sothat the seven weeks of the bardo seem very long. During the first three weeks, our previousbodily form is sustained, and we behave in much the same way as before, but even that isunpredictable. When we are sitting down, we suddenly feel as if we must move, and whenwe are happy, sudden panic attacks may afflict us, or we may have other such unpredictableexperiences.After the third week, we experience the particular behavior of beings in the realm inwhich we are going to take rebirth. If we are to be reborn as a pigeon, for example, we feelthe beak, wings, and talons of the pigeon. Sometimes we feel we have half the previouslife’s body and half of the next life’s body.The signs of rebirth in each of the six realms are as follows: if we are going to take birthas a god or a man, we will hold our heads high and gaze upward; if we are going to takebirth as a demon or animal, we feel an inclination to look sideways or to the side; if we aregoing to take birth as a hell-being or hungry ghost, then we cast our eyes downward.The color signs are as follows: inclining toward hell, we see black light and a burnt treestump; toward the hungry ghost realm, we see wafting black wool; toward the animal realm,we see an ocean of blood; toward the human realm, we see white light; toward the demonicrealm, green light; and toward the god realm, white light about a meter in length. We shouldrecognize these signs immediately for what they are and understand our destiny, and withoutsuppressing this knowledge, and recognizing the place of our putative rebirth, thedharmakaya is revealed as the pure presence that abides in the ground of being. With ourconfidence in pure presence, the basic clear light and the primordial alpha-purity of thedharmakaya appear to us again, and through these indications, which are like the materialfor repairing a broken irrigation ditch so that the water flows smoothly, we gain liberation."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Just as in the miracle of instantly reaching a place by the mere thought of going there,those who can see the door of the Dzogchen view will understand the bardo consciousnessand will recollect the pure fields of nirmanakaya emanation of the ten directions. With astrong aspiration to be in those fields, the tendency to remain in the bardo existencedissolves, and as we enter the flow of blessings of true reality, the pressure to reincarnateis released, and taking birth in a pure-land, we attain buddha.The rituals of the Perfect Completion of Life [gongdzok] to be performed each weekafter the death are highly efficacious and must be done regularly and punctually. The wisemen of ancient days made the bardo of becoming a special method of benefiting sentientbeings by inviting a rigzin-lama trained in the creation and completion yogas to create themandala of wrathful and peaceful deities. He calls the consciousness of the deceased into aname card and burns it, and then bestowing empowerment, providing an introduction to thenature of mind, and indicating the path, he impels consciousness toward a pure-land. This isof great benefit to the deceased. Just as we can lead a wild horse into a cul-de-sac ravineby the reins, in the same way, when devoted disciples who have kept their commitments arein the bardo, a rigzin-lama can confidently lead them to safety. In the story of DzogchenMingyur Namkha Dorje, merely by guiding his disciple Nyak Kepon Shar by means of thewrathful and peaceful deities, he released him from the lower realms into the human realm.If within the fourth day, we can release consciousness from its place, it is of vital benefit tothe deceased.If the lama performs the sur offering ritual along with the tsok feast offerings and butterlamp offering, the deceased will obtain food, drink, and clothing in the bardo and againbenefit will ensue. Consider the example of the beneficial effects of a single sur offeringrite. Once a group of Yilung men ventured out on a trading expedition to Golok, and, after aprotracted period, their families heard that they had been robbed and killed by Golokbandits on the road. They invited Gyarong Pontrul Rinpoche to perform the prayers for thedeceased, and Rinpoche performed a sur rite. One person in the group of traders, however,had escaped the fate of his friends and was returning home despite the many difficulties ofhunger, thirst, and bitter cold. When he reached the high Changtang plateau, all of a suddenhe smelled burned sweet tsampa, and instantly he lost all his hunger and thirst. When hereached home, he saw Rinpoche and his monks performing the sur rite, and he realizedwhere the smell of tsampa had come from. His family was amazed at the effectiveness ofRinpoche’s ritual.Moreover, the power of visualization and recitation of mantra by a lama generates thecompassionate attitude and a special samadhi for the deceased, and the deceased will thusbe released from the illusion of fear in the bardo and will take rebirth in the nirmanakayabuddha-fields of Great Bliss (Sukhavati), in the buddha-field of the Copper-ColoredMountain, or somewhere like that. Even if the deceased is unaffected in that way, he or shewill temporarily take birth in a higher realm and finally attain nirvana or super-nirvana. Soit is essential to perform the seven weekly sur rites after the death of our mother or father,along with protection and offering rites, as much as we can."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" The stages of instruction about the four bardos are now completed. The purpose ofexplaining the four bardos after the detailed explanation of the main Dzogchen praxis ofview, meditation, conduct, and fruition is clarified by Longchenpa in The Treasury of theDharmadhatu, These modes of being defy goal-directed endeavor;They shine only while freely resting in the spontaneity of the now.This supreme secret is disclosing itself in this moment,And since we shall not be lured away from it, even in the bardo,This apex approach of the vajra-heartTowers, exalted, above all progressive, graduated approaches. This explanation of the stages of the four bardos in this fifth chapter is an addendum to themain practice of Cutting Through to alpha-purity in Dzogchen. Its stages accord with thevarious intellectual needs of those who cannot gain immediate or direct release on the path.This step-by-step instruction on the four bardos benefits the student—Dzogchen has manypowerful, efficacious, skillful means of instruction.If we fully assimilate this Dzogchen teaching, for the best of us, all subjectiveenvisionment in this life will vanish into the matrix of reality, and we will accomplish thedimension of great transference and the rainbow body as did the rigzin Garab Dorje andGuru Tsokye Dorje. For those of lesser acumen, it is vital that, at the time of death in thebardo, we should recognize the three lights—effulgence, optimal effulgence, andpenultimate attainment. Then, practicing consciousness sublimation, we can take birth in thepure-lands of the trikaya. In the bardo of reality, we should not be afraid of the sound,lights, and rays of the assembly of wrathful and peaceful deities, but directly recognize ournaked self-envisionment as the natural creativity of pure presence. Like a child nestling intoits mother’s lap, the clear light that we have recognized through the lama’s introductionunites with the basic clear light, and we are released into the ground of being. If we havenot been able to use any of these three opportunities to gain release, finally, when we enterthe bardo of becoming, if we can be sure that whatever appears is delusion and if weremember our present root guru, Amitabha, and the others, then, by the power of a single-pointed devotional prayer to be sublimated to the nirmanakaya pure-lands, we canovercome all the sufferings of that bardo of becoming. This advice is of crucial importance,so keep it in mind.Furthermore, in order that we should not waste this precious human body, first, weshould accumulate merit by practicing the four discursive meditations that turn the intellectback upon itself: meditations upon the precious human body, the impermanence of life,karmic cause and effect, and inexorable karmic retribution. Then, through the preliminarypractices of the five “hundred-thousand” exercises and the graduated practice of the uniquetantric teaching, we should obtain buddha in this lifetime, relying on the same supremepractice as the great masters of the past."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"If people who have great interest in buddha-dharma in general and in Dzogchen inparticular would exert a little effort right now, not only might they take rebirth in a pure-land in the next life, but they might attain buddha in this very lifetime. Just look at thecondition of people in the world today! The stress of competition day and night amongpeople with wealth, fame, and power, like the roaring of thunder and lightning in a thickcloud, seems to preclude the possibility of happiness and peace of mind. This body-mindhas limited capacity, and if we go beyond that limit, then bodily pain, stress, and tensioninevitably arise, and modern illnesses such as depression and so forth, leading to insanityand even death can result. Depending upon Dzogchen, to the contrary, the body remainsrelaxed, and all emotional stress is immediately resolved. Dzogchen praxis is like theuniversal panacea that solves everything that we consider to be a problem and takes thesting out of every vicious event, so that the essence of happiness is pure pleasure andharmony among family, friends, partners, and the community.
