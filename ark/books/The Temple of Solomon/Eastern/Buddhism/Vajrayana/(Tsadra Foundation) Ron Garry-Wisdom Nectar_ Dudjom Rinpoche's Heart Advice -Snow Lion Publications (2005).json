With his vajra command, he enthroned, empowered, and con-firmed the reincarnate great treasure revealer Lord Dudjom Jikdral YeshéDorjé Drodul Lingpa Tsal as his representative. Moreover, many ancienttreasure texts’ scriptures fully laud Dudjom Rinpoché as a great personage,the crowning jewel of the sublime secret Original Translations’ entire doc-trine, the king of Buddhist teaching throughout the three realms. He is likethe newly dawning sun amidst the constellations of learned, accomplishedawareness- holding masters of the snowy Himalayan region. Completelywithout rival in the past, present, or future, his name’s renown reverber-ates unceasingly throughout the breadth of this great globe’s realms. Inincomparable kindness, this supreme master accepted the task of being theholy protector and supporter of beings and the Buddhist doctrine duringthis era of decline. Here, I will write a brief account of this master’s history.In the past, great individuals not focused on extremes were imbued withthe strength of familiarization with intense, forceful compassion, andentered sentient beings’ realms with endless intent. On the level of defin-itive meaning, since primordial, original time, they were liberated in thebasis, and epitomized the youthful vase body, the body of ultimate enlight-enment’s great exaltation, the non-conceptual wisdom of all buddhas’minds within the expanse of ever-excellent awareness.

Without movement, they unceasingly diffuse naturally-arisen elab-orations—unimaginable, excellent miraculous displays that perform incon-ceivable good for others.In general, on this subject of their enlightenment’s manifestations, someare related in a linear progression, from former to latter; some are mani-festations that appear at the same time; and others include the appearanceof blessed manifestations. These cannot be restricted to a single, definitepattern: in as many water vessels of disciples as there are, their moon’scompassionate form will appear; they are unlimited. Thus, my mind, lim-ited to my own experience, is incapable of fathoming this lord’s physicalincarnations, and naming them as this one or that one.Nevertheless, here I will follow the common histories of his series oflifetimes, arranged in a linear fashion from former to latter. I will use as mybasic source the supplication to his own series of incarnations, Pearl Neck-lace, written by this great treasure revealer, king of Buddhist teachingthroughout the three realms. Further, this treasure revealer’s son, whoserealization is of one taste as his father’s, Lord Jikmé Trinlé Norbu GélekNampar Gyalwé-dé, wrote a volume of detailed commentary to Pearl Neck-lace, entitled The Ruby Garland, A Necklace That Delights Awareness-Holding Dakinis. Moreover, the most senior of all this great treasurerevealer’s direct disciples, a great learned, accomplished master of the defin-itive meaning, Chadral Sangyé Dorjé Rinpoché, wrote a supplication to thelife of the incarnate great treasure revealer Jikdral Yeshé Dorjé DrodulLingpa Tsal called The Seed of the Three Kinds of Faith. Apart from thesetexts, this supreme great treasure revealer’s own treasure texts containinformation concerning his past lives in such places as the treasure texts’proclamations and histories, where I ask that you learn the details.In this case, I will write a short outline of his lifetimes according to themeaning of a supplication made in this great treasure revealer’s own vajraspeech, in rhinoceros-numbered verse [i.e., solitary]. The first line states:In the past, you were awareness holder Capable Vajra Adept.This refers to a time during this present age, one in which one thousand andtwo buddhas have accepted disciples and lit the lamp of the sacred Teach-ings. Thus, this age is called the age of illumination or the fortunate age.

He wasknown as the great treasure revealer Dudul Dorjé, fourteenth in his seriesof lifetimes.Dudul Dorjé’s subsequent emanation, who preserved the Victor’s KatokMonastery with the three cycles of teaching and meditation practice, wasknown as Gyalsé Sönam Déu-tsen, fifteenth in his series of lifetimes.Gyalsé Sönam Déu-tsen’s reincarnation held the treasury of teachings ofgreat mystery, from which the dakini’s breath had not evaporated, andraised the victory banner of the Victor’s Katok Monastery’s doctrine.

This was the great treasure revealer Garwang Dudjom Lingpa,seventeenth in his series of lifetimes.Thus, the words “in the past” imply this series of lifetimes until the pres-ent, although the name of Capable Vajra Bearer is the one explicitly men-tioned. This concludes a short commentary to the first line of thissupplication. The second line states,In the future, you will be Joyful Buddha Infinite Devotion.This great person’s rebirth is the reincarnate master named Sangyé PémaShépa Drodul Rikzin Trinlé Drupé-dé or Péma Ösel Pal-zangpo, whosefather is the holy, great treasure revealer’s own son, named Dola Chok-trul, Jikmé Chökyi Nyima. His mother, who shows all the marks and signsof being a dakini, is named Péma Khandro. In the Iron Horse Year (1990),the lotus of his enlightened form’s marks and signs of physical perfectionblossomed anew amid numerous amazing portents. From a young age, hispositive propensities awakened, igniting the dynamic power of his innatetranscendent knowledge, the domain of exalted beings’ exceptional lives.Thus, he learned such things as reading and writing at a mere glance. Frommany lineage-bearing, learned, and accomplished masters (including hisuncle, the treasure revealer’s son, sublime lord Jikmé Trinlé Norbu; thesenior master among all his past life’s direct disciples, lord of refuge ChadralSangyé Dorjé; and the treasure revealer’s disciple Gonjo Tulku, OrgyenChémchok) he drank to his satisfaction the nectar of the Canon’s and Trea-sures’ empowerments, transmissions, and pith instructions. The force ofhis recollection of past lives has given him prodigious knowledge of bound-less approaches to the Buddhist teachings of scripture and realization. Now,at the age of fifteen, the qualities of his learning, nobility, and excellence areunrivalled in every way, and his blessed activity that flourishes in everydirection has made him a living holy lord, supporter of sentient beings andof the Original Translations’ very secret doctrine.Not only that, his manifestations will appear in the future as art, as incar-nate beings, and as supreme manifestations who will work for sentientbeings’ good, appearing spontaneously, without movement or effort, inwhatever form can tame each being. This results from two causes—hiscompassion’s blessings and beings’ flourishing positive acts, appearing inthe same way as water, the moon’s reflection, and the moon’s circle. Just as4Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the moon can leave a reflection, the body of perfect rapture’s moon canappear as a manifestation to its disciples. Likewise, just as a vessel of watercan contain the moon’s reflection, disciples have the merit to perceiveenlightenment’s manifestation. Just as the moon appears effortlessly onwater when there are disciples, the autumn moon’s emanated reflectionappears without being veiled for an instant; thus, this lord’s dance ofemanated magical displays will continue uninterrupted and boundlesslyuntil the ocean of the wheel of life runs dry.Specifically, among the six regions of this world, the Land of Jambu, thenorthern kingdom of Shambhala is an especially exalted region. There,bodhisattvas on awakening’s tenth stage of culmination appear as a seriesof kings. This lord will take rebirth as the lineage bearing monarch Wrath-ful Sharp Vajra with an Iron Wheel. He will defeat armies of wild barbar-ians who always impair living beings’ happiness and have both hostileattitudes and violent behavior. That king, guide on the path to awakening’speace, will be an emanation of this great treasure revealer.Further, in the past, when this fortunate age’s buddhas each formulatedvows and aspirations to work for sentient beings’ benefit, the youngest ofthe thousand guides, Boundless Intellect, said, “The Buddha’s qualities arelike space and sentient beings as well are endless; therefore, I make theaspiration to equal the sum of all your acts as buddhas, including yourlongevity.” The moment he said this, gods’ voices arose from space pro-claiming, “Excellent!” The force of this aspiration will result in Transcen-dent Buddha Infinite Devotion being the last buddha of the thousand; thatbuddha is definitely this great treasure revealer’s future emanation.This concludes a very brief presentation of the second line’s meaning. The third line states,At present, you are Lotus-Born’s representative, Drok-ben incarnate.Our supreme, incomparable spiritual guide, the king of the Buddhist teach-ing throughout the three realms, the sublime Dudjom Jikdral Yeshé Dorjé,was an emanation of Drok-ben Translator’s body, an emanation of thequeen of the basic space of phenomena Yeshé Tsogyal’s speech, and an ema-nation of the powerful sovereign Padmakara’s mind.

His father belonged to a family descended fromthe Buddhist king Trisong Déutsen; his mother belonged to a familydescended from Ratna Lingpa.From an early age, the excellent patterns of his natural affinity awak-ened: Guru Rinpoché and his consort manifestly revealed their faces to himand empowered him as the chief of their profound treasures. When theyenthroned him as Lotus-Born’s representative, they gave him the nameOrgyen Garwang Drodul Lingpa-tsal. He became satisfied drinking thenectar of ripening and liberating instructions, with supporting transmis-sions, granted him by many great, authentic learned, accomplished masters.His innate transcendent knowledge overflowed in relation to the view, med-itation, and philosophical systems: he became a lord of scholars unrivalledin the past, present, or future. As a great bodhisattva, he used the six tran-scendent perfections and the four means of attracting disciples to leadbeings to temporary uplifted states and to the ultimate definite excellenceof awakening. Without having to take the path of hardships based on expe-dient meanings, he traversed the direct path of Ati’s essence of luminosityand reached a high level of accomplishment where his manifest realiza-tion’s qualities blazed together. The wisdom dakinis openly gave him suchtreasures as the inventory of his yellow parchment treasures, and theguardians and protectors of the Teachings watched over him as if he weretheir own son. His mastery of the three forms of blazing and three kindsof gathering led him to become worthy to be carried on the crown of theheads of all living beings, be they high, low, or middle.During a degenerate time such as ours, his profound aspiration that theteaching and practice of the Ancient Translation School’s doctrine notdecline but spread in one hundred directions led him to build Buddhistinstitutions widely. He set aside the effort involved in overtly revealingthe earth treasures designated as his, and turned his attention to verymeaningful projects: to preserve the Kagyu and Nyingma doctrines, heraised to the four continent’s skies the victory banner of teachings thatunite all lineages, such as Jamgon Kongtrul’s Five Treasuries. To serve as aplace of offering for beings of the degenerate age, who need to accumulatemerit, he built a replica of both the structure and contents of the palace ofLotus Light on Tail-Fan Island’s Copper Colored Mountain, and a newretreat center connected to it. He thus completely relieved the doctrine andbeings’ decline.6Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"He newly constructed an inconceivable number of the three sacred sup-ports, such as nourishing the doctrine by reprinting ancient texts that hadbecome very rare. He thereby became the single source of help and happi-ness throughout Tibet. The activity he fostered proved as true the scripturesthat foretold him to be Lotus-Born’s representative. Moreover, his feettouched the ground of every large area of this world, including Tibet, allprovinces of greater Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, India, China, America, andEurope. He fulfilled the prophecy that every being with whom he made aconnection through sacred substances, seeing his face, hearing his voice, ortalking with him would be led to Tail-Fan Island’s pure land of Lotus Light.Groups of learned and accomplished high lamas and high ranking mon-archs, officials, and great leaders bowed their heads at his feet, yet pride orarrogance never influenced him. He remained in equanimity in relation tothe eight worldly concerns and lived with the discipline of concealing him-self in the guise of an ordinary person. He saw infinite arrays of visions,including those of inconceivable buddhas’ pure lands, deities and spiritualmasters, and receiving dakinis’ prophecies, yet he bound these with a strictseal of secrecy and never allowed himself such acts as bragging, praisinghimself, or considering himself important.When his disciples’ karma and aspirations came to fruition, the seal of hisrealization’s expanse was naturally released; this produced his cycles ofmind treasures—the Three Roots’ outer, inner, secret, and innermost secretpractices, with those of the Teachings’ protectors, their activity rituals, sup-portive instruction manuals, and other texts. These treasures, like theessence of the dakinis’ heart blood, are concise, clear, come with the lin-eage’s forceful blessing, and bring swift accomplishment. In these and otherways, these treasures satisfy whomever comes into contact with them, likethe essence of nectar. He composed definitive texts, then granted theirentire empowerment and transmission to their respective foretold respon-sible recipients and designated heirs of the lineage, filling this world’s landswith these profound teachings’ flourishing harvest.

For his own tradition’s New Treas-ures and Ancient Treasures’ cycles of ordered rituals, he composed suchtexts as outlines, replicas, commentaries to intensive mantra practice, vajrafeast activity, manuals, and supplementary texts; concise or extensive pro-found texts of instruction related to the process of the four empowerments;histories, such as accounts of the Tibetan kings, the history of Buddhism,and the outline of the Nyingma doctrine; as well as records of his studiesand supplementary teachings. In all, his collected works span twenty-fivevolumes. Moreover, he gathered dispersed ancient texts from the OriginalTranslations’ Canon, proofread them, produced definitive versions, and putthem into order—a total of forty-eight volumes.In brief, this example of his preservation of the Canon and Treasure texts’continuity exemplifies his elucidation and spreading of the teachings thatlead to spiritual maturity and liberation, along with their supportive texts.Both India and Tibet have never seen such deeds, which is why he is knowntoday as a second Lotus-Born Master. His kindness restored from its foun-dations the precious doctrine of the sublime secret essence of luminosity.At the completion of his enlightened activity, in the Fire Tiger Year (1986),the display of his wisdom form’s miraculous appearance dissolved into thebasic space of phenomena; the basis of his manifestation merged with theexpanse of Ever-Excellent Lotus-Born Master’s enlightened mind, tobecome of an identical flavor. This concludes a commentary on the thirdline’s meaning. The last line states,Jik-dral Yeshé Dorjé, to you I pray.“Jik-dral Yeshé Dorjé” is one of this great treasure revealer’s names. A sup-plication he composed to his list of names states,The dakinis told my noble father Jampal Norbu, who belonged to a royal family,“A son greater than his father will appear!”As predicted, this was my name before birth:To you known as Yeshé Dorjé, I pray.8Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"As stated, his father, Jampal Norbu Tenzin, a Katok Monastery reincarnatemaster descended from King Trisong Déutsen, received his son’s name“Yeshé Dorjé” in the dakinis’ prophecy. “Jik-dral” was added by Karmapa:this is an oral account I have heard.

I wish thereader to know that although I have translated these precious teachings,I am not portraying myself as a spiritual teacher, Lama, or accomplishedsenior student. I am just a simple practitioner and translator who, at therequest of my Lama, has tried to the best of my ability to make these pre-cious prayers and teachings available to the English reader. These teachingsare, and have been, a crucial support of my spiritual practice, without whichI would be hopelessly lost.In this spirit, I have refrained from giving my own commentary to anyof Dudjom Rinpoché’s teachings. His words speak perfectly for themselves.I have added endnotes explaining various terms, Tibetan expressions, orother references that will be familiar to a Tibetan Buddhist but may possi-bly be unknown to some Western readers.

He was writing for anaudience already familiar with the Buddhist teaching and its diverse termi-nology, not to mention the many references to Tibetan culture, includingpeople, places, landmarks, and the various Tibetan idiomatic expressions.This assumption of familiarity cannot necessarily be made regarding allWestern practitioners, particularly those new to Buddhist teachings, espe-cially the Vajrayana teachings. Therefore, I have added extensive endnotes,not to clarify His Holiness’s writings, but to address this unique situation. As Richard Barron aptly wrote:Every translation brings its own set of problems and compro-mises. Works such as Kongtrul’s accounts of his life and liveswere written for people of his time and his cultural background,so there is the implicit assumption that an educated readershipamong his peers would understand the implications of the state-ments and observations he made. The same assumption cannot bemade about an educated English-speaking readership.3Literal Translation vs. Meaning-to-Meaning TranslationThe translation of Buddhist texts into Tibetan began over thirteen hun-dred years ago, when Guru Rinpoché was in Tibet. Many enlightenedWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"beings were involved in this process, including the sublime master GuruRinpoché and the great translator Bérotsana. The distinctive feature ofthese translations was their emphasis on translating meaning-to-meaning(don sgyur) from the Sanskrit texts, and not translating word-for-word(tshig sgyur). Fortunately, both the masters and their translator-discipleswere fully enlightened buddhas. This meant that they fully, completely,and thoroughly understood the teachings of Buddha, as they were of onemind, and the translation of the meaning occurred naturally. There’s therub. Although the Lamas I have consulted and worked with in review ofthis translation are, from my perspective, of one mind with His HolinessDudjom Rinpoché, I am not. Therefore, although I have tried my best torender this translation according to its meaning, using literary English asopposed to a hybrid Tibetan-English jargon, there are still a few key termsthat I do not yet have confidence in translating into English. Key termsnot translated into English are, for example: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya,nirmanakaya, tantra, mantra, vajra, and nada. My feeling is that whencommonly accepted translations of these key words occur, they will reflecta meaning-to-meaning translation. Many of our finest and most brillianttranslators have coined excellent translations for these key terms, whichwill soon probably become standard. Still, I am timid. The first occurrenceof a translated key term will be accompanied with its corresponding Tibetanor Sanskrit in parenthesis. These key terms will also be listed at the end ofthe book in a word list that contains the English translation and the origi-nal Tibetan.Key Terms: A Note about Use of Tibetan or SanskritSometimes the translation of a key term into English can leave the readeras mystified concerning its real meaning as he would be by the originalSanskrit or Tibetan, with the loss of the levels of meaning found in theoriginal. In those instances, I chose not to translate the word into English.In almost all instances when an English translation is not used, I have cho-sen the Sanskrit term since in most cases the Sanskrit word is easier topronounce and is more familiar to the English reader than its Tibetanequivalent. Terms left in Sanskrit are italicized at their first appearanceexcept in cases in which they’ve made their way into the English language,16Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"such as Buddha, bodhisattva, karma, and samsara.I do believe the English language will someday become a sacred lan-guage, blessed by both Tibetan and Western fully enlightened Buddhas, inwhich all key terms will be translated into English (with only a few remain-ing in Tibetan and Sanskrit). Although at the moment the process is goingwell, it is still a work in progress.Text TitlesI have chosen to translate most titles of texts and collections into Englishwhile giving the corresponding Tibetan or Sanskrit title in parenthesis onfirst occurrence. Proper NamesIn general, proper names have been left in their most recognized render-ing in Tibetan or Sanskrit. In cases where they are translated, I include theappropriate Tibetan or Sanskrit in parenthesis on first occurrence. Propernames and deity names, such as Jigdral Yeshé Dorjé, Amitabha, and Chen-rezi are usually not translated but are instead rendered in their originalTibetan or Sanskrit, or whichever name is in common usage with Englishreaders. Place names are sometimes left in the original language (Oddiyana,for example) unless there is an obvious English rendering, such as Tibet forthe Tibetan name Bö.Regarding deities and pure lands, because these names carry profoundmeaning and may aid in the English reader’s understanding, I have trans-lated into xEnglish some of their names. For instance, Tsokyé Dorjé istranslated into English with the aid of Sanskrit as Lake Born Vajra, (GuruRinpoché’s name given by the dakinis upon his birth in the center ofDanakosha Lake). The first occurrence of a translation in English of a deityname, proper name, or place name is accompanied by the Sanskrit orTibetan given in phonetics.Translating names (Lake Born Vajra) and places (Glorious Copper-Col-ored Mountain) into English is a work in progress.

Throughout this book I have adopted theWiley system of transliteration. As for phoneticization, there are as manysystems as there are translators and dialects of the Tibetan language, noneentirely satisfactory, including my own. In the use of phonetics, I hoped toapproximate the sound of the Tibetan as spoken by my teachers—south-eastern Tibetan with a dash of Amdo and Kham. I have used a system thatis as simple as possible, so as not to distract the reader from the materialitself.Table of ContentsThe initial table of contents provides a detailed overview of the entire bookand lists each and every work contained herein.

Each chapter begins with a translator’s introduction, followedby the translation of Dudjom Rinpoché’s teachings.My intention in writing this introduction to Dudjom Rinpoché’s teach-ings is to provide a context for the reader to realize what a gift we literallyhold “in the palm of our hands,” in the form of this book that contains a col-lection of His Holiness’s pith instructions. I find for myself that readingwith an open heart—reading with faith and devotion—is the key thatallows the mastexant. For instance, right now I hear the songbirds ofspringtime outside my window, while morning sunlight shines throughshimmering green bamboo leaves blown by a warm, fragrant breeze. It isSaturday morning, and I decide to stay home and enjoy this gorgeous time.These circumstances create a feeling that is hard to describe; perhaps wordsthat come close are peacefulness, serenity, and happiness. I have a strongsense of enjoyment, and I try to recreate it, consciously and unconsciously.This attempt underlies my choices of the house I live in, the type of gar-den I cultivate, and the car that I drive.Due to our individual karma, this process does not manifest in the sameway for everyone. We have diverse feelings that we try to engender oravoid, and we sometimes react differently to similar external phenomena.Whatever our personal likes and dislikes are, they are all based upon feel-ings that arise within. These feelings are, in turn, based upon circumstancessuch as those just mentioned. Therefore, we then attempt to create and sus-tain circumstances that will result in internal feelings we enjoy, such aslove, inspiration, and happiness. We attempt to change or avoid circum-Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"stances that may result in feelings we dislike, such as suffering, disappoint-ment, and fear. But isn’t it actually the feeling itself that we enjoy and wantto recreate and maintain? Don’t we actually spend our entire lives grasp-ing after pleasurable inner experiences, attempting to create and sustainthese feelings through creating and sustaining outer circumstances, just aswe push away unpleasant inner experiences, trying to change and avertthese feelings through changing and averting outer circumstances?So we then engage in our life project to set up external circumstancesthat give us the internal feelings we want; and our joys and sorrowsthroughout our life are very much related to how well we succeed in doingthis. Unfortunately, sooner or later, all these projects based upon graspingand avoidance end in failure, due to unforeseen circumstances beyond ourcontrol, such as illness, unwanted separation from loved ones, or imminentdeath, whatever the case may be. Our attempts at maintaining or avoidingexternal circumstances will almost certainly bite the dust, especially whendeath occurs.According to the Buddhist Vajrayana teachings, when we die, we enter aseries of experiences called the intermediate state (bardo). This series ofexperiences will culminate in our rebirth in one of six realms of cyclic exis-tence, unless our previous practice and the blessings of our Lama results inliberation during this intermediate state. Clearly, at death, when our mindseparates from our body, we no longer have the ability to create the circum-stances that support feelings we enjoy or to prevent the feelings that causeus suffering. In the intermediate state between this life and the next, ourexperiences and the feelings related to these experiences arise based onconditions that are the results of the cause and effect of our past karma. Thisis the bad news.Fortunately, there is also very good news. Through practicing the Bud-dha’s teachings with faith and devotion, it is possible to become free of allcircumstances, both positive ones that lead to feelings we enjoy and nega-tive ones that lead to feelings we dislike. Buddha skillfully taught manymethods that take us beyond circumstances, progressively leading us to therealization of our true nature, which is Buddha Kuntu Zangpo (AlwaysNoble), primordially pure, great exaltation. Dudjom Rinpoché’s writingscompiled in this book are the essence of all Buddhist teachings and are thequintessence of the wisdom mind of Kuntu Zangpo, present from thebeginningless beginning.

This profound teaching containswithin it the entire path of Great Perfection (Dzogchen), including how toprepare oneself for retreat and how to discern a proper location, as well askey instructions on view, meditation, and conduct with direct advice onhow to bring your experiences onto the path. During my three-year retreat,my teacher, Lama Tharchin Rinpoché—who was one of those fortunateretreatants for whom Dudjom Rinpoché wrote this text—would refer us tothis text over and over again. It seemed that the answer to every questionon meditation that we posed could be found in Essential Advice for SolitaryMeditation Practice. We all discovered this to be true, and this text contin-ues to be my treasured companion.As a preface to this text, Dudjom Rinpoché explains why he wrote it:In this text I present essential advice for solitary meditation prac-tice in an easily accessible way.

As I previously mentioned, the purposeof this introduction is to engender in the reader a sense of the preciousnessand profundity of these teachings—heart advice, songs of realization, songsof tantric gatherings, supplication prayers, and aspiration prayers. This willbe done with a discussion in three parts based upon the above quotation:✦Rinpoché’s purpose for writing this text: To give “essential advice forsolitary meditation practice”✦Type of instruction: Essential advice that is “direct instruction for thepractice of the innermost secret Great Perfection placed in the palm of thehands,” that is, the Pith Instruction Class of the innermost secret GreatPerfection✦To whom it is revealed: Fortunate individuals, those “who feel heartfelttrust in the teaching of the profound secret Great Perfection and in theLama who reveals it and who wish to take their practice to completion”Rinpoché’s Purpose for Writing This TextDudjom Rinpoché states that his purpose for writing this text is to give apractitioner “essential advice for solitary meditation practice.” “Essentialadvice” means direct advice, based upon experience, on how to practicemeditation. This is not a theoretical or intellectually based teaching givenby a scholar, but the direct transmission of pith instructions to be appliedin practice given by an accomplished master.“Solitary meditation practice” is usually understood literally: medita-tion in an isolated physical environment such as mountains, forests, or anyplace secluded from the activity and distractions of daily life. In this case,“solitary meditation practice” is also meant to be taken figuratively, asDudjom Rinpoché later mentions in the text: In a solitary place, the thought of death penetrating [the practi-tioner’s] heart...This statement refers to inner retreat, which is based upon an attitudethat allows a practitioner to be in the true solitary place—mindful of one’sown impending death—regardless of one’s outer physical location.

This dual purpose makes this textunique and invaluable.Type of Instruction: Pith Instruction Class of the Innermost Secret Great PerfectionEssential Advice for Solitary Meditation Practiceis a “direct instruction forthe practice of the Great Perfection.” All tantric teachings are especiallyprecious—they shine the light of wisdom in our world darkened by igno-rance and delusion and lead to enlightenment in one lifetime. Great Perfec-tion is the summit of all Buddhist teachings and is the most direct and easypath to achieve this goal. In The Festival of Delight6Dudjom Rinpochéexplains that the Great Perfection is superior to the lower vehicles:This king among vehicles holds stainless space—the originallypure nature of mind whose nature is clear light, the naturallypresent, changeless, self-manifest wisdom that is naturally andspontaneously present in oneself—to be the original ground ofthe Great Perfection. In contrast, the eight lower levels of Buddhist teachings are based uponintellectual contrivance and fabrication. Dudjom Rinpoché explains thisfrom the perspective of the Great Perfection:The eight lower levels have intellectually fabricated and contrivedthat which is changeless solely due to fleeting thoughts thatnever experience what truly is. They apply antidotes to and rejectthat which is not to be rejected. They refer to as flawed that inwhich there is nothing to be purified, with a mind that desirespurification. They have created division with respect to thatwhich cannot be obtained by their hopes and fears that it can be30Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"obtained elsewhere. And they have obscured wisdom, which isnaturally present, by their efforts in respect to that which is freefrom effort and free from needing to be accomplished. Therefore,they have had no chance to make contact with genuine, ultimatereality as it is (rnal ma’i de kho na nyid).Dudjom Rinpoché further explains:In this way, the natural Great Perfection is present as the natureof mind that transcends ordinary mind, the uncompounded clearlight of wisdom that is awareness, in which all noble qualities ofthe essential nature are spontaneously present.Great Perfection is categorized into three classes—Mind Class, VastExpanse Class, and Pith Instruction Class (upadesha). “Direct instructions”falls within the category of the Pith Instruction Class, the most profoundof the three. Dudjom Rinpoché supports this point of view by citing theSupreme Array of Ati(a ti bkod pa chen po):7O Vajrapani! If the Pith Instruction Class is not established,There will be those who cling to deliberate examination [MindClass],And in particular, those who will believe in nothing at all [VastExpanse Class].Therefore, this definitive secret essence [Pith Instruction Class]—Like a butter lamp amid darkness,Like an elephant among oxen,Like a lion among wild animals,Or like a horseman among those on foot—Is superior to them all.The Pith Instruction Class of Great Perfection constitutes the essentialkey teachings that a Lama reveals to his disciple in a direct way, heart toheart.

Reflection on this fact naturally fosters apprecia-tion for these teachings.The Vehicles of BuddhismFor a proper foundation to be laid for a practitioner to further cultivateappreciation for these teachings—Great Perfection’s vast and profound pithinstructions imbued with the ability to bring us to enlightenment in thisvery lifetime—I feel it is very helpful to give an account of the nine Bud-dhist vehicles according to the Nyingma school as taught by His HolinessDudjom Rinpoché. For an extensive explanation of the nine vehicles pleasesee Appendix 1. The Buddhist teachings are very precious at every level, as the essence ofthe Hinayana teachings is never to harm any sentient being. The essence ofthe Mahayana teachings is to have compassion toward all sentient beings.The essence of the Vajrayana teachings is to have pure view, which is to seeall phenomena as wisdom phenomena—all forms as the wisdom deity’sbody; all sounds as the wisdom deity’s mantra; and all thought as the dis-play of the wisdom deity’s mind. In our world so full of various sufferingsand problems, these are extremely precious teachings. Each vehicle is a lampthat illuminates the darkness of this world. For a person to receive and prac-tice any of these teachings is a profound blessing in and of itself. In our casewe are extremely fortunate: among the plethora of teachings and styles oftransmission, Dudjom Rinpoché in Essential Advice for Solitary MeditationPractice—and for that matter, in all of his teachings, prayers, and songs ofrealization contained in this book—chose to teach the essence of all teach-ings, Great Perfection, in the most direct style possible, as pith instruction.I refer the interested reader to Appendix 2, which is an overview of theplace these pith instructions have within the classification of Buddhistteachings.Teachings Given for Fortunate IndividualsAlthough Dudjom Rinpoché wrote Essential Advice for Solitary Medita-tion Practicebased on a request related to a specific three-year retreat, these32Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"teachings are not limited to those retreatants but have relevance for all for-tunate individuals. “Fortunate individuals” does not refer to those with high social status orto those who are wealthy, well-educated, famous, or well-connected; nor isDudjom Rinpoché referring only to those who are Lamas nor to those whohave spent years in retreat. Instead, he specifically states that fortunateindividuals have three characteristics:1. heartfelt trust in the teaching of the profound, secret Great Perfection2. heartfelt trust in the Lama who reveals it3. the wish to take their practice to completionThese are the qualifications that make someone a fortunate individual toreceive these profound Great Perfection teachings. Let’s explore why thesethree qualities are so outstanding.Heartfelt Trust in the Great PerfectionHeartfelt trust in Great Perfection’s teachings is vital; without it, fullenlightenment on this profound path is impossible. Patrul Rinpoché writesin his Song of Encouragement to Read the Seven Treasuries, The ExcellentWords of Omniscient Longchen Rabjampa:Simply reading one line of such an excellent text Can leave your worldly experience in ruins.Having met with the good fortune to read it entirely,What will you think if you throw it away?9Patrul Rinpoché wrote these words to describe The Precious Treasury ofthe Space of Phenomena(chos dbyings rin po che’i mdzod). Reading PatrulRinpoché’s praise to all Seven Treasuries10transports us close to the expe-rience of the meaning held in these texts. We feel inspired. For me, theabove quotation aptly applies to all the precious teachings collected withinthis book. “Simply reading one line of such an excellent text can leave yourworldly experience in ruins”—this is very true. It is necessary to trust theteachings and to take the time to read them slowly and carefully, allowingtime for both reflection and meditation.

Who would study to become a heart surgeon—endless years of schooling—if there was doubt in the efficacy of heart sur-gery, or if there was doubt that the doctor training you knew how to performsurgery himself? If you are a surgeon who constantly doubts and worrieswhether the procedure will actually work or not, you will not be successful,nor will you last long as a doctor. As dangerous as this might be to yourselfand the patient, there is an even greater potential danger if you enter GreatPerfection’s path without trust, because not only can this life turn into adisaster, there may even be negative consequences in your future lives. Having doubt in the view, meditation, and conduct of the Great Perfec-tion is an obstacle that will keep you from achieving any result. When prac-ticing within the context of the lower eight vehicles, dualistic mind is usedas the path—either to reject, apply antidotes, or transform the passions.But when practicing in the context of Great Perfection, awareness itself isused as the path. In awareness there are no activities of ordinary dualisticmind. If doubt occurs, that is dualistic mind and is not the practice of GreatPerfection.In Heart Advice of My Always Noble Spiritual Master, Patrul Rinpochéquotes Guru Rinpoché:11Confident faith allows blessings to enter you.When you are free of doubt, whatever you wish will be accom-plished.Heartfelt Trust in the Lama Who Reveals ItWhy is it important to trust in the Lama who reveals these precious GreatPerfection teachings? It is said that on the path of Secret Mantrayana, allspiritual attainments come from relying upon your Lama. Dudjom Rin-poché writes in his commentary to the preliminary practices called TheChariot for the Path of Union:12All spiritual attainments of the profound Secret Mantra arisefrom nowhere else but through reliance on the Lama.34Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Patrul Rinpoché explains the importance of having faith in one’s Lama:This is also necessary in this vajra essence vehicle, the heartessence of the Natural Great Perfection. It is not taught that theprofound truth should be established through the process ofanalysis and logic as is done in the lower vehicles. Nor is it taughtthat common accomplishments should be relied upon in order toobtain supreme consummation, as in the lower tantras. It is alsonot taught that you should emphasize reliance upon the illustra-tive wisdom of the third empowerment to introduce ultimatewisdom, as it is in the higher tantras. In the Great Perfection tra-dition, you rely upon prayer made with fervent devotion to thesupremely realized Lama alone, whose lineage is like a goldenchain untainted by the defilement of broken tantric commit-ments, and consider him to be an actual Buddha. If you simplypray to him in this way, your mind will merge inseparably withhis wisdom mind. By the power of the transference of his bless-ings to you, it is said that realization will arise within you.13Saraha has said:Taking to heart what your Lama saysIs like seeing a treasure in the palm of your hand.14As we can see, trust in one’s Lama is crucial for the Vajrayana practitioner.Dudjom Rinpoché describes the three types of faith as follows:Faith is classified as three: clear faith, enthusiastic faith, and con-fident faith.15Patrul Rinpoché himself emphasizes the importance of faith:The compassion and blessings of the Triple Gems are inconceiv-able, but whether these enter our mindstreams depends entirelyon our faith and devotion. If you have immense faith and devo-tion, the compassion and blessings that enter you from yourteacher and the Triple Gems will also be immense. In the sameIntroduction: Heart Advice (zhal gdams)35Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"way, if your faith and devotion are just moderate, the compassionand blessings that enter you will also be moderate. If you haveonly a little faith and devotion, only a little compassion and [afew] blessings will enter you. If you have no faith and devotionat all, absolutely no compassion or blessings will enter you. Ifyou do not have faith, even meeting the actual Buddha and beingaccepted as his disciple will be of no benefit...16Although it is essential to have complete trust in the Lama from whomyou receive Great Perfection teachings, this trust develops gradually. It isessential for a beginner to examine thoroughly his or her teacher. As PatrulRinpoché has said:First, skillfully examine a Lama;In the middle, skillfully rely upon a Lama;Last, skillfully emulate his realization and action: A noble person who does this is on the authentic path.Having examined a Lama and having been accepted by him, it is impor-tant to maintain faith and respect. As Tobden Chöying Dorjé writes in TheInvaluable Treasury of Discourses and Tantras:First examine a Lama or teaching; then once you have acceptedthem, maintain faith and respect without fatigue, discourage-ment, or fluctuations. Rely upon the Lama and the Dharma withtenfold faith:1. unchanging, like the king of mountains2. vivid and without shadows, like the sun3. endlessly deep, like the ocean4. without an ulterior motive, like a mother5. without limit or center, like space6. without relaxation, like a bowstring7. without discouragement and fatigue, like a ship8. unperturbed by events, such as others’ influence or scolding [by the master], like a bridge9. continual, like a stream10. respectful but supple and embellished with politeness, likea silken cord1736Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Introduction: Heart Advice (zhal gdams)37At the Hinayana and Mahayana level of practice, students see theirteacher as a spiritual friend and can choose to weigh advice received. Onceyou practice within the context of the higher tantras, you promise to dowhat your Lama says. As Dudjom Rinpoché points out in Essential Advicefor Solitary Meditation Practice:Therefore, everyone is at first independent until a Lama hasaccepted them. However, once you rely upon a Lama and are con-nected through empowerments and instructions, you are not freeto disregard your tantric commitments (samaya). Didn’t you bowbefore your Lama, lord of the mandala, at the end of the fourempowerments and say: As of now, I am your servant,And I offer myself to you. Having taken me as your disciple, Please use every part of me.With this promise, no matter how great or powerful you are,aren’t you subject to your Lama? You also said: Whatever my lord commands, That I will do. Once you took this promise, do you have the power not to dowhat he says? If you do not keep your promise, it is not appro-priate to call you anything other than a vow-breaker, no matterhow unpleasant a name this is.For a practitioner—whether from the East or West—to progress on thispath, trust in the Lama is essential because sometimes his or her advicewill help bring you beyond your current limitations, thereby being a greataid on your path. Let’s take a simple example: When a person decides topractice in the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, that person first searches fora Lama with whom he or she feels a connection. The student requests thisLama to accept them and give them a practice and related teachings. Perhapsthe master suggests that the student begin with the preliminary practices.Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Initially, the student may become very excited at being accepted and givena practice. The master then explains that the preliminary practices includefour parts: taking refuge and engendering bodhicitta, mandala offerings,Vajrasattva practice, and guru yoga, and that the student must accumulate100,000recitations of each. People react differently to this suggestion. Some become excited by theopportunity and, due to their pure faith in their teacher, request teachingson how to do these practices without even the thought, “That’s a lot toaccumulate.” Others, upon hearing about the accumulations, hesitate atfirst, but due to faith and trust in their Lama, they go beyond their initialhesitation and request instructions for practice with the thought, “That’s alot to accumulate, but if my Lama makes this suggestion, there must be agood reason for it.” These people enjoy the benefits of these foundationalpractices early in their path, and the foundation for their practice becomesrock solid, an appropriate basis upon which to build their practice further.Still others may feel overwhelmed upon learning about the practice andmay think, “That’s a bit too much for me at the moment; maybe in thefuture I can try.” Perhaps many years down the road they may begin theirpreliminary practices. And then some people never take their master’sadvice due to hesitation and lack of faith; after many years, having neverbegun, they will have accumulated only regrets. In this simple example,we can see how having even a little faith in one’s Lama can lead to follow-ing his advice, thereby yielding huge benefits.Traditionally, after completing the preliminary practices, one then prac-tices Mahayoga. This includes practices contained within the categories ofthe three roots: Lama, wisdom deity, and dakini. Some people undertakethese practices in the context of a three-year retreat; others, in other formsof long-term retreat. For example, at the retreat center Péma Ösel Lingwhere I live, many people begin one of these practices in the context of apublic summer retreat and then complete it at home throughout the courseof the next year or two. We can see, based upon the words of these sublime wisdom teachers,how important it is to develop genuine and sincere trust in our Lama sowe will be ready to receive the profound Great Perfection teachings whenthe opportunity arises. For an excellent explanation on how to rely upona Lama I highly recommend the chapters on how to follow a spiritualfriend and on guru yoga in The Words of My Perfect Teacherby Patrul38Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Rinpoché; and also The Teacher-Student Relationship, written by JamgönKongtrul.The Wish to Take Their Practice to CompletionThe third characteristic of a fortunate person is the wish to take their prac-tice to completion. As we have seen, Dudjom Rinpoché states that a fortu-nate person feels...heartfelt trust in the teaching of the profound, secret GreatPerfection, and in the Lama who reveals it; and they wish to taketheir practice to completion. For them, this text will provide anopen gate [to the path of Great Perfection].What does Dudjom Rinpoché mean when he speaks of “taking theirpractice to completion”? This means to practice until attaining full andcomplete enlightenment. It is very important that a person in the GreatPerfection tradition have as their motivation for receiving and practicingthese profound teachings the aim to attain full enlightenment for sentientbeings’ benefit, not for selfish or limited motivations. Our motivation is like an eye that takes aim when shooting an arrow ata target. What we really aim at, we will strike. Therefore, it is of the utmostimportance to choose a proper target before letting our arrow fly. It is alsoimportant that once we have made that choice, we make sure we aim accu-rately at the target. In the same way, if we wish to receive and then prac-tice the Great Perfection teachings, we must first choose the proper, finesttarget—full enlightenment for others’ benefit. Next, we must make surethat, due to our selfishness or limitations, we are not surreptitiously aim-ing at a target other than the chosen one.Limited motivations include the wish to attain the otherwise worthygoal of the state of an arhat or solitary sage, goals that fall short of fullyenlightened Buddhahood. For many of us, the most common obstacle pre-venting us from bringing our practice to completion (that is, full enlight-enment) is not that we focus upon the limited goals of the arhat or solitarysage but that our motivation is tainted with selfish drives. It seems to methat this is the most dangerous potential hazard we confront. If our moti-vation is pure and set on the goal of attaining enlightenment for others’Introduction: Heart Advice (zhal gdams)39Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"benefit, sooner or later this will come true, and there is no way we canbecome sidetracked. As my Lama always says:If your motivation is pure, there is no way to make a mistake.On the other hand, if our motivation is selfish or limited, we will never freeourselves from the pain and sufferings of the ever-spinning wheel of life.Although we may voice the proper words, “May I receive these teachingsin order to attain enlightenment for others’ benefit,” if our real underly-ing motivation is otherwise, we will not be able to achieve our stated goal,since aiming at lesser targets based on selfishness is an obstacle to spiritualprogress. Therefore, it is crucial not to practice Great Perfection with anunderlying motivation mixed with worldly concerns, or with a motivationunintentionally mixed with desire for our own personal gain, for example,to become a spiritual teacher with many students, a famous workshopleader with a large income, or a respected spiritual teacher in “new age” cir-cles that will provide us with a career, money, fame, and prestige. It isimportant always to check our motivation to protect our practice frombecoming merely a way to prop up the ego within a Buddhist communityor from becoming an unintended method for creating the self-delusion ofbeing a great practitioner. Checking our motivation also protects us fromusing our practice as a way to run away from painful life experiences andresponsibilities. Whatever the case may be, if this is our underlying moti-vation, these limited goals may be accomplished but never the goal of fullenlightenment for others’ benefit.Therefore, we must become aware of our underlying agendas in order toguarantee that our motivation is not tainted by selfishness or self-promo-tion. If we find it is tainted, we can take that recognition as an opportunityto purify it. My teachers emphasize this point over and over again, and itis one that is very important for the sincere practitioner to remember. Iwrite this with no one but myself in mind, as self-criticism and as areminder.ConclusionThe teachings Dudjom Rinpoché presents in the Heart Advice section andthroughout this book are extremely precious and very rare. They are the40Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"essence of the vast body of Buddhist wisdom; historically, they were verydifficult to obtain. Traditionally, in the Himalayan region, to receive GreatPerfection teachings, a person must first have practiced for many yearswithin the context of the Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana teachings.There was no such thing as “Great Perfection workshops” or “Mondayevening teachings” available. Instead, a meditator would receive theseteachings after an arduous journey beginning with the gradual develop-ment of trust in his or her Lama. Based upon that developed trust, furtherinstructions would be given on how to meditate. The student then wouldset out upon the progressive stages of the path, including: extensive prelim-inary practices; creation stage Mahayoga—outer, inner, secret, and inner-most secret extensive practices related to the Lama, wisdom deity, anddakini; transmission stage Anuyoga—working with channels, winds, andbodhicitta; and then the preliminary practices specific to the Great Perfec-tion. After many years of practice, accumulating merit, and a close, pure con-nection with your Lama, if you were one of utmost good fortune, you mayhave received the precious Great Perfection teachings. It was always thisdifficult and rare to receive these precious teachings.Traditionally, when one treads the path in this way, a deep trust in theteachings and the Lama who reveals these teachings would come naturally.This process would refine the practitioner’s motivation until its targetwould be only the attainment of complete and full enlightenment. Bud-dhist practice propelled by selfish motives is ultimately self-defeating andpointless. As Dudjom Rinpoché says, whoever has these three qualities—faith in the Great Perfection teachings, faith in the Lama who reveals theseteachings to you, and the goal only to become fully enlightened—is thefortunate person to whom he reveals the pith instructions of the Great Per-fection, in a form of direct instructions placed in the palm of your hand. Whether we are “fortunate individuals,” truly qualified to receive theprecious and profound Great Perfection teachings, is entirely up to us.Nowadays, there are many teachings available in bookstores and librariesand numerous talks and workshops offered by qualified (and unqualified)people; consequently, it is very easy for the sincere student searching for apure teacher or a pure, unbroken lineage to be overwhelmed and confused.I myself searched for such a lineage for many years, while being exposedto a vast array of spiritual teachers and teachings.

I know without a doubt that Dudjom Rinpoché is the holder of such a lin-eage and that his pure lineage continues to this day, held by some of hisheart disciples, whom I have the greatest good fortune to have as my teach-ers. This lineage is entirely complete within itself. It is not necessary to addanything from Western pyschology, New Age philosophies, nor any othertradition.Therefore, the Heart Advice teachings found in this book—and for thatmatter all the writings contained herein—are the spiritual inheritance ofhumanity: the living realization, and the methods to attain it, passed downfrom master to disciple for over 2,000 years in an unbroken lineage.

Post-meditationHow to keep your vows and tantric commitments (samaya), and how toinclude all activities of this life within the Dharma.First, the PreparationNow I will say a little about the first topic. That which is called mind—thisso very vivid awareness—appears from the very beginning at the sametime as Buddha Kuntu Zangpo.18Nevertheless, Buddha Kuntu Zangpo knewthis awareness as his own. Alas! Sentient beings endlessly wander in sam-sara because they do not recognize this, taking rebirth in countless formsof the six types of beings. Everything they have done has been meaningless. Now, one time out of hundreds you have obtained a human form. If youdo not do what you can now to avoid rebirth in the lower realms, yourplace of rebirth might be unknown, but wherever it might be among the sixclasses of beings, suffering will be its only sure feature. It is not enough to have just obtained this human form. You must atonce practice the authentic Buddhist path since the time of your death isunpredictable. Furthermore, at death you should have no regrets andshould not be ashamed of yourself, like Jetsun Milarepa. In my, Milarepa’s, religious tradition,We live so as not to be ashamed of ourselves.When entering the Buddhist path, it is not sufficient to be a person whoonly adopts the outer appearance of a person on the path. Cut all entangle-ments to desirable things and to this life’s affairs. When you enter the gateto Buddhist practice without having cut these ties, you will lack determi-nation but not attachment to homeland, wealth, possessions, lovers,spouses, friends, relatives, and so forth. Your attitude of attachmentbecomes an underlying cause; the objects of your attachment, catalysts.When these meet, negative forces19will create obstacles. You will once againbecome an ordinary worldly person and will turn away from creating pos-itive karma.Therefore, reduce your food, clothing, and talk to the bare necessitiesand one-pointedly unite your mind with the Dharma without attachmenttoward the eight worldly concerns.2044Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 44"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"In a solitary place, the thought of death penetrating his heart,The practitioner, deeply averse to grasping,Sets the retreat boundaries by giving up thoughts of this lifeWith a mind that does not encounter anyone, the eight worldly concerns.21You should do just as Gyalwa Yang Gönpa advised; otherwise, mixing theeight worldly concerns with your spiritual practice is extremely dangerous,like eating food mixed with poison. The eight worldly concerns in conciseform can be reduced to two things, hope and fear, which are, in fact, desireand anger. Inner desire and anger take apparent outer form as male demons(gyalpo)22and female demons (senmo). As long as your mind is not freefrom desire and attachment, you will not be free from these demons, andobstacles will never end. Therefore, question your innermost thoughts repeatedly, “Do I harborthe eight worldly concerns or conceited attachment to this life?” Strive togive up these faults. Once you sustain the eight worldly concerns in youroutlook, you invent the false semblance of spiritual practice: the thingsacquired in such deceit amount to wrong livelihood.23In accord with the saying “You accomplished half of the Buddhist teach-ings when you left your native land,” you turned your back on your home-land to wander in unfamiliar lands. Now that you have parted companyfrom your friends and relatives in a positive way, do not listen to thosewho try to discourage you from pursuing your spiritual practice. Now thatyou’ve given away your possessions, rely upon whatever meritorious dona-tions24come your way. Once you’ve recognized all your pleasures as obsta-cles created by bad habits, cultivate an attitude without desires. If you are not contented with few possessions, as long as one “need”after another arises, the deceptive demon of your pleasures will enter with-out much trouble. Do not take as true anything others say, good or bad: Donot regard it with hope or fear; do not affirm or deny it. Allow others tosay whatever they like, as if they are talking about a corpse.

Do not allow yourself to lapse into bad habits. In particular, whetheryour practice is simple or complex, ensure that it is not sporadic. Makeyour practice regular and even, and do not leave even a moment’s spacefor anything ordinary. During retreat, seal your cave’s entrance, or if thatdoesn’t apply, do not meet with, talk to, or be on the lookout for others. Completely discard all distractions of your restless mind, expel the stalebreath, and assume the correct physical posture for meditation. Your dual-istic mind must firmly stay on awareness with mindfulness, without mov-ing for even an instant, like a solid oak stake planted in the ground.

Exert yourself according to each of their commentaries until experi-ences arise.28Especially, embrace guru yoga as the vital essence of practice,and practice diligently. If you do not, your meditation will grow slowly, andeven if it grows a little, obstacles will arise and genuine realization will notmanifest in your mindstream. Therefore, forcefully pray with uncontriveddevotion. After some time the realization of wisdom mind will be transmit-ted to your mindstream, and an extraordinary realization that cannot beexpressed by words will definitely arise from within yourself. As it has been said by Lama Shang Rinpoché:To nurture stillness,To nurture spiritual experiences,To nurture samadhiand other spiritual states—These are common.But by the strength of your devotion,For realization to arise from withinDue to the Lama’s blessings—This is rare.Therefore, for the ultimate truth of the Great Perfection to appear inyour mind is dependent upon the preliminary practices.

Onceyou have concluded this with certainty in awareness free from all charac-teristics of intellectual mind’s fabrications and contrivance, awarenessnakedly manifests as self-manifest wisdom. Words cannot express it.Metaphors cannot illustrate it. It does not get worse in samsara nor betterin enlightenment. It has not been born, nor will it come to an end. It has notbeen liberated nor deluded. It does not exist or not exist. Awareness isunlimited and impartial. In short, from the very beginning, awareness has never been establishedas being material and having characteristics that can be conceptualized,because its essence is primordially pure, sublime, all-pervasive emptiness.The ocean of realms of phenomena of existence and enlightenment natu-rally manifest as the display of unobstructed emptiness, like the sun and itsrays.29Therefore, awareness is neither partial nor a completely empty voidbecause its nature is the supreme spontaneous presence of wisdom andnoble qualities. Thus, awareness, the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness, epitomeof the three kayas, is the primordial nature of reality. Precise recognition ofawareness, ultimate reality as it is (yin lugs), is what is called the GreatPerfection’s view beyond the intellect. Our sublime master [Guru Rinpoché] said:48Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 48"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The dharmakaya, beyond the intellect, is ultimate reality.We actually hold in our hands the wisdom mind of Buddha KuntuZangpo. How wonderful! This is the very essence of the six million, fourhundred thousand Great Perfection tantras, themselves the consummationof all eighty-four thousand divisions of the Victorious One’s collection ofteachings. There is nothing beyond this. You should resolve all phenomenain this awareness. Definitively conclude that all phenomena [are contained]within this awareness.30MeditationNow, once you have resolved all your inner doubts and misconceptionsregarding this view, to sustain its continuity is called meditation. All other meditations with reference points are conceptual meditationsfabricated by the mind. This is not how we meditate. Do not lose hold ofthis view previously described, and in that state release all consciousnessesof the five senses within the natural state (rang babs) and rest at ease.Do not meditate to arrive at a conclusion: “That’s it!” If you meditate inthat way, it becomes intellectual activity. Here, there is no object of medi-tation whatsoever nor even an instant of distraction. Distraction from rest-ing in awareness is true delusion. Don’t be distracted! Whatever thoughts arise, let them arise. Do not follow after them and donot suppress them. If you ask “In that case, what should I do?” whateverobjective phenomena arise, whatever appears, do not grasp phenomena’sappearing aspect as you rest in a fresh state, like a small child looking insidea temple.31 When all phenomena are left as they are, their appearance isnot modified, their color does not change, and their brilliance does notdiminish. If you do not spoil phenomena with clinging and graspingthoughts, appearances and awareness will nakedly manifest as empty andluminous wisdom. However, many teachings considered to be very deep or extremely vasthave left individuals of lesser intelligence mystified. If I put my finger onthe concise essential meaning, it is this: In the gap between the lastthought’s cessation and the next’s arising, isn’t there a fresh, present know-ing (da lta’i shes pa) that has not been modified even in the slightest—luminous, naked awareness? That itself is awareness’s abiding state!32Essential Advice for Solitary Meditation Practice49Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"But one does not permanently abide within the nature of reality (de khona). Doesn’t a thought suddenly arise? That is the natural display of aware-ness. However, if you do not recognize thoughts as soon as they arise, theywill naturally spread. This is called “the chain of delusion,” the root of sam-sara. Simple recognition of thoughts as they arise breaks their flow. Releasethoughts within that recognition. When you remain in that state, arisingthoughts will all be liberated equally within awareness, the expanse ofdharmakaya. This is the main practice in which the view and meditation ofCutting through Solidity (khregs chod) are cultivated as one. Garab Dorjé has said:From within the nature of originally pure stainless space, Awareness suddenly manifests. That moment of mindfulness33Is like finding a jewel at the bottom of the ocean.This is dharmakaya, not fabricated nor created by anyone.Persevere in this way. You must meditate without distraction day andnight—do not leave emptiness in the domain of mere understanding. Bringeverything back to awareness itself.ConductNow, I will describe how conduct can enhance meditation and how to putour practice to the test.The main point, as I previously explained, is never to part for an instantfrom the perception of your Lama as a true Buddha; make heartfelt,intensely focused prayers to your Lama. This is known as “devotion that isthe sole sufficient cure”; it is superior to any other method to removeobstacles and enhance your practice. You will forcefully and decisivelytravel all paths to enlightenment.Faults in MeditationIf you experience dullness and drowsiness, arouse awareness. If you expe-rience excitement and agitation, relax your mind. Always, the meditator’svivid mindful awareness should not impose a disciplined mindfulness.Mindfulness is simple recollection of the recognition of your own nature.Continuously sustain vivid mindful awareness at all times as you go50Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"about your daily activities, whether eating, sleeping, moving, or sitting,whether during meditation or post-meditation.

Instead, whatever feelings of happinessand suffering are there, settle in their naked, vivid, lucidly present essence.This single vital point, and none other, applies to everything. Do not con-fuse yourself with a lot of thinking. A separate meditation upon emptiness as an antidote to what must berelinquished—thoughts and passions—is unnecessary. Awareness of whatmust be relinquished liberates it naturally with that recognition, like asnake’s knot uncoiling. Most people know how to say the words “the ultimate concealed mean-ing of the clear light vajra essence,” like a parrot’s chatter, but don’t knowhow to practice it. We are all so incredibly fortunate! Carefully consider thisonce again—there’s something to be understood. During our beginninglessseries of lives until now, our mortal enemy, dualistic clinging,35binds us tosamsara. Now, thanks to our Lama’s kindness, his introduction to naturallyabiding dharmakaya releases both poles of grasping,36like a feather con-sumed in fire, with nothing following and without a trace. Isn’t that reallysatisfying? If you do not practice once you’ve obtained the profound instructions ofthe swift path such as these, it is as if a wish-fulfilling jewel were placed ina corpse’s mouth. What a waste! Practice without being discouraged!37Furthermore, beginners will lose their mindfulness in distraction due tounwholesome thoughts that get out of control; these thoughts coalesce inthe form of underlying mental activity. At some point, a piercing mindful-ness returns, and the thought of regret arises, “Oh, I’m distracted!” Nev-ertheless, do not do anything whatsoever at that moment, such as stoppingthe flow of previous thoughts or regretting having been distracted. Whenthis vivid mindfulness returns, it is sufficient merely to sustain naturallyresting in precisely that mindfulness.A famous saying advises, “Do not reject thoughts; see them as dhar-makaya.” However, until you perfect the subtle power of higher insight,you might dwell upon the thought, “This is probably dharmakaya!” andremain in a blank state of peaceful abiding. You thus risk getting trappedin a spaced-out, indifferent, unreflective state.

At that instant, wisdom beyond mind will nakedly and clearlymanifest.While you tread the path, [this experience of wisdom] will not comeuntainted with one or another of three meditative experiences—bliss, clar-ity, or conceptionlessness.38Nevertheless, placing your mind without theslightest bit of hope, fear, attachment, or conceit due to holding such expe-riences as supreme prevents errors. It is very important constantly to giveup distraction and to meditate with one-pointed vigilant mindfulness.When you lapse into sporadic practice and mere intellectual understanding,arrogance will arise out of just a little peaceful abiding. If you do not care-fully observe your spiritual experiences, you will merely be skilled in pre-tense and knowledgeable of the right words, which is not beneficial.As the Great Perfection tantras state:Intellectual understanding is like a patch,It will fall off.And,Spiritual experiences are like mist,They will evaporate.As this says, even some slight positive and negative objective event hasdeceived great meditators,39and many lose their bearings in the midst ofcircumstances.

Therefore, be very careful.When you continually familiarize yourself with this over a long periodof time, devotion or some other suitable catalyst will at some point causethese spiritual experiences to overflow into realization, and you will vividlysee naked awareness, as if a veil were instantly lifted from your head. Youwill become utterly free and spacious. This is called “the supreme seeingthat does not see anything.” Thereafter, thoughts arise as meditation; men-tal stillness and movement are simultaneously liberated. Moreover, at first,recognition of thoughts liberates them, like meeting someone familiar.41Inthe middle period, thoughts are liberated by themselves, like a snake’s knotuncoiling. Finally, thoughts are liberated without benefit or harm, like athief entering an empty house. These three ways of liberation will occurgradually. A deep, decisive trust manifests within you that all phenomenaare the magical display of your awareness alone—waves of realization ofemptiness and compassion will surge. Choosing between either cyclic exis-tence or enlightenment ends. You realize that Buddhas are not “good” andsentient beings are not “bad.” Whatever you have done, you will be care-free beyond words without knowing how to move from the sole nature ofphenomena (dharmata), and therefore, you will uninterruptedly abide inthis infinite space day and night.As it is said in the Great Perfection tantras:Like the sky, realization is changeless.This kind of Great Perfection practitioner42appears to have an ordinaryhuman form, but his or her mind is dharmakaya. He or she abides in wis-dom mind free from effort and activity and, without doing anything, trav-erses all paths and stages. Finally, ordinary mind and phenomenaexhausted, like the space of a broken vase, the body vanishes into atoms,and the mind vanishes into the nature of phenomena. This is called attain-ing43the immortal vase body (gzhu nu bum sku), which is the inner clar-ity of the original ground, stainless space (dbyings). This will come about.Since this is the ultimate consummation of view, meditation, and conduct,it is called the fully manifest unattainable result. The stages of spiritualexperiences and realization arise either in a progressive order, without aprogressive order, or all at once. This occurs according to the particular fac-ulties of people, but there is no difference when the result is achieved.Essential Advice for Solitary Meditation Practice53Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Post-MeditationHow the teachings encompass keeping vows and tantric commitments, andapplying them in your daily life.Although you applied yourself in the practice of view, meditation, and con-duct as described above, if you were unskillful in post-meditation’s con-duct, and your vows and tantric commitments were damaged, impedimentsand obstacles will hinder your progress on the paths and spiritual stages inthe short term, and ultimately you will certainly fall to the lowest hellcalled Incessant Pain. Therefore, it is extremely important never to be sep-arate from vigilant mindfulness, not making any mistakes regarding whatkind of conduct to accept and what to reject. The great master Guru Rinpoché has said:My view is higher than the sky;My attention toward karma and its consequences is finer thanflour.44Thus, once you give up a coarse blank state of mind, act with circumspec-tion to the cause and effect of your actions. Guard your vows and tantriccommitments so that not even the slightest one is damaged; ensure thatfaults and downfalls do not taint you. Secret Mantra’s tantric commitmentshave many categories, but in a concise form they can be subsumed into one—the tantric commitments of the wisdom body, speech, and mind of your rootLama. A mere instant of having considered the Lama to be a human being45is said to postpone spiritual attainment (siddhi) by years and months. Whyis this so? Because the relationship with your Lama is very serious. Vajrapani has said:Spiritual attainment is received from the Lama.Therefore, everyone is first independent until a Lama has accepted him orher. However, once you rely upon a master and are connected throughempowerments and instructions, you are not free to disregard your tantriccommitments.

Having taken me as your disciple, Please use every part of me.46With this promise, no matter how great or powerful you are, aren’t yousubject to your Lama? You also said: Whatever my lord commands, That I will do.Once you took this promise, do you have the power to not do what hesays? If you do not keep your promise, it is not appropriate to call you any-thing other than a vow-breaker, no matter how unpleasant a name this is. Furthermore, it has not been taught that you should keep your tantriccommitments especially with a Lama of higher status, who has a large ret-inue, who is wealthy, powerful, and prosperous but that it is unnecessaryto keep your tantric commitments with a Lama of lower status, who takesa humble position, who engages in the fearless conduct (brtul zhugs) of abeggar. Whatever the case may be, you must understand the potential risksand profit of a commitment with any Lama, since it won’t suffice to remainstanding around like a dim-witted old horse. This being so, carefully con-sider whether the purpose of keeping your tantric commitments is for yourLama’s sake or for yours. Reflect on this with a composed mind, just aswhen one prepares medicine.47If you think you do so for your Lama’s sake,you can completely give them up as of right now. If doing so is not for hissake, it doesn’t make sense to deceive yourself.48In relation to tantric commitments with your spiritual companions, ingeneral, view positively whosoever has entered the gateway of Buddha’steachings, and train in pure vision (dag snang).

You should continuously think of nothing apart from the teachings,your Lama, and sentient beings. Do not allow your motivation and actionsto contradict one another. Do not compete with anyone who has the title oroutward appearance of a yogi or a monk. Since this is most important, donot foolishly do this. Shut your mouth and subdue your mind. Deep down, if you only think about what will help you in future lives,what is called “the Dharma” is something that you yourself must do. Ifyou hope or need for others to practice virtue in your name after you die,it will be difficult for that to help you.49Therefore, turn your attention within and apply yourself. With a heart-felt attitude of renunciation, be extremely diligent, mindful, and deter-mined to practice for as long as you live. The main practice is to strike thevital point in the cultivation of the profound view and meditation. Post-meditation is conduct that is consistent with conduct to be accepted orrejected, to correctly [keep] the tantric commitments of the Vajrayana, theprecepts of the bodhisattvas’ training, and the vows of individual libera-tion.50Such conduct’s imprint is that noble qualities cannot help but arisewithin you. This is why the Great Perfection is the path upon which peo-ple who committed negative acts can become suddenly enlightened.The Great Perfection is so profound that it also has obstacles, just assources of great profit entail great risk. The reason for these obstacles is thatthe instructions’ impact stirs up your previously accumulated negativekarma; signs of this are the outward appearance of demons’ magical appari-tions of obstacles. It is possible that various unwanted outer and inneradverse conditions will appear, such as gods and demons showing theirforms in your place of practice, calling you by name, and disguising them-selves as your Lama and giving predictions. Various frightening magicalapparitions may appear in your experiences or dreams. Also, unpredictablethings may happen to you in person, such as being subject to attackers,robbers, thieves, or diseases. In your mind, you may experience intensesuffering for no apparent reason and become despondent; intense passionsmay arise; devotion, love, and bodhicitta may diminish; and thoughts mayarise as enemies—you feel you are about to go crazy.

They hold on to and chase after thoseadverse conditions52until they die, and thus Mara takes the opportunity tolead them down the path to the lower realms. What a pity! Pray to yourLama that this does not happen to you! Moreover, although it is fairly easy to bring adverse circumstances intothe path, doing the same for positive circumstances is very difficult. Eventhose who vainly assume themselves to be highly realized beings riskenslavement by the son of Mara53and are distracted by devoting them-selves to ways of becoming important in this life.

Right now, wouldn’t it be better to limit the spread of these neg-ative deluded thoughts?You may ask, “When thinking is curtailed, what does awareness looklike?” It is utterly empty, totally open, spacious, free, and resplendentlyblissful. It has never been established as having substantial characteristics.There are no phenomena in samsara or enlightenment that are not per-vaded by it. From the beginning, it is naturally and spontaneously presentand never separate from oneself. It lies beyond action, effort, and the mind’scomprehension.Now you may ask, “What is it like to recognize the natural face of aware-ness?” Even though you recognize awareness itself, you do not know howto describe it, like a mute person trying to describe his dream. You do notknow how to distinguish the sustainer, yourself, from the awareness thatis sustained. Previously, you were unable to abide for even one moment, constantlythinking and doing everything: These thoughts, who are the old destroyer,have nothing to do now in the vast expanse of awareness, which is like acloudless sky. The movement of thoughts dissolves, disperses, and fallsaway. All the power and strength of thought is lost in awareness. Thenawareness, the wisdom of the naturally abiding dharmakaya, just abidesclearly and nakedly. Now you may ask, “Who introduces this awareness to you? What isdecided upon? How is confidence established?” Initially, you are introducedto awareness by your Lama. Through that introduction, you know yourown true face and directly recognize your true nature (ngo rang thog tu’phrod).72However the phenomena of samsara and enlightenment appear,know that they are none other than the natural display of awareness. Thus,decide upon this single awareness (thag rig pa gcig thog tu chod). Just as thewaves of the ocean subside back into the ocean, all thoughts that arise van-ish directly into awareness. Thus, gain confidence in liberation (gding grolthog tu bcas pa). Therefore, it is beyond being an object of meditation, theact of meditating, and the mind that grasps on to meditation. If that is so, you may say that it will be sufficient even if one does notmeditate. It is not like that at all! Just by recognizing awareness one doesnot arrive at the state of liberation. During beginningless lifetimes, we havebeen confined within a structure of deluded habitual patterns. From thenuntil now, we have spent our human existence as the servant of our worth-124Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 124"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"less thoughts. At the time of death, we do not know where we will go, butwe follow our karma and inevitably suffer. Therefore, now it is necessaryto meditate, sustaining the continuity of awareness that was introduced.The great omniscient Longchenpa said:Although you have been introduced to your nature, if you do notbecome familiar with it, You will be carried away by the enemy of thought like an infant inbattle.Generally, what is called meditation means resting in awareness withoutdistraction or clinging and sustaining its continuity through original mind-fulness73of the state of naturalness, thus becoming accustomed to the orig-inal essential nature. Furthermore, when you are meditating and thoughtsarise, the way to become familiar with your nature is to let them arise.There is no need to view them as enemies. Relax naturally in their arising.If they do not arise, do not try to make it so. Just rest directly in its non-arising. Also, when meditating, if a gross thought suddenly appears, it is easilyrecognized. But in regard to subtle thoughts, until a few have arisen, youare not aware of them. Therefore, they are called undercurrents of thought.Because these undercurrents of thought act as the sneaky thieves of med-itation, it is very important to place the sentry of mindfulness on guard. Ifyou can sustain the continuity of mindfulness in all situations, whethereating, sleeping, moving about, or sitting, in meditation or in post-medita-tion, that itself is enough. The Great Master said:Although hundreds or thousands of explanations are given,There is only one thing to be understood:Know the one thing that liberates everything;Sustain awareness itself, your true nature.The Great Master also said:If one does not meditate, confidence is not gained, But if one meditates, confidence will be gained.Heart Gem for Fortunate Disciples125Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"What kind of confidence will be gained? By meditating with intensivediligence in this way, there will be signs that familiarity has been actualized,such as this: Concrete tight clinging and grasping to the solidity of dualis-tic perception gradually relaxes, and the many efforts associated with hap-piness and suffering, hope and fear will lessen. Your devotion toward yourLama will intensify and trust in your Lama’s profound instructions willarise from your heart. After a time, the solid mind that clings to duality willdisappear by itself. Then gold and rocks become equal. Food and excrementbecome equal. Gods and demons become equal. Virtuous actions and neg-ative actions become equal. You will not have a preference between purelands and hell realms.Until this happens, to the face of dualistic mind, there will be virtue;there will be negative actions; there will be pure lands; there will be hellrealms. There will be joy and sorrow, and action and its results are all unde-niable. This being so, the Great Master said:My view is higher than the sky;My attention toward karma and its consequences is finer than flour.74For this reason, it is not acceptable to say, “We are Great Perfection prac-titioners,” or “We are great meditators,” while stinking from alcohol, fart-ing, and sleeping. Instead, establish a foundation with pure faith, devotion,and tantric commitments, follow the main practice with an intense unre-lenting diligence, and put aside all the activities of this meaningless life inorder to meditate. The special quality of the profound path of the GreatPerfection is that you will certainly reach the unassailable state in this verylifetime without relying on future lives.

In addition, I have added one profound and beautiful song oftantric gatherings from Dudjom Lingpa’s Tröma cycle. The first five songs are called tsok lu(tshogs glu), songs of tantric gath-erings. These songs, which are written in verse and sung with beautifulmelodies at tantric feast gatherings, are an expression of His Holiness’srealization. They are usually sung when the feast is offered to the vajramaster. The Tibetan word tsokliterally means “gathering,” and lumeans“song.” For the tantric feast ritual (ganacakra) different things are gath-ered. First, it refers to the gathering together of male and female practition-ers, yogis and yoginis. Next, it refers to the gathering together of wisdombeings and guardians of the Dharma. Thirdly, it is the gathering of offer-ings that are pleasing to the senses, which must include meat and alcohol.Meat is the substance symbolic of skillful means that hooks spiritual attain-ment. Alcohol is the symbolic substance of wisdom, the luminous lamp ofwakefulness. In the context of a tantric feast gathering it is held that spir-itual attainment cannot occur without these two substances. Finally, “gath-ering” refers to the gathering of merit and wisdom through participationin this tantric feast.For followers of Guru Rinpoché, the tantric feast-wheel ritual (gana -Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"cakra) is considered the highest, most extraordinary, and most effectivepractice. It is considered the most effective practice because it is a methodthat removes our mind’s two obscurations through the accumulation ofmerit and wisdom; it is the most profound method to confess downfalls inour tantric commitments; it is the best means to remove obstacles; and itis through making the remainder aspect of the feast offering that all theworldly deities are satisfied.Technically, a tantric feast ritual must include both male and female prac-titioners. If there are only male or female practitioners present, it is calledjust a “feast offering.” To whom are the offerings made? They are made tothe six guests who are gathered: the Lamas, wisdom deities, dakinis andguardians of the Dharma, male and female practitioners, worldly deities,and dakinis of the outer and inner twenty-one and thirty-two sacred places.These guests are pleased in different ways. The root and lineage Lamas arepleased with the offering of one’s view; the wisdom deities are pleased byone’s concentration during the creation stage of the ritual; the dakinis andprotectors of the Dharma are pleased by keeping one’s tantric commitmentspure; male and female practitioners are pleased by the enjoyable qualitiesof the food and drink offered; the worldly deities are pleased with theremainder offering; and the dakinis of the outer and inner twenty-one andthirty-two places are pleased by the vajra songs chanted during the ritual. The best occasions to perform a tantric feast ritual are on the eighth(Buddha day), tenth (Guru Rinpoché day), fifteenth (full moon day), andtwenty-fifth (dakini day) days of the lunar moon; when beginning retreat;and upon conclusion of a retreat, to name a few instances. In the New Treas-ures tradition of Dudjom Rinpoché, on Guru Rinpoché day rituals are per-formed related to various manifestations of Guru Rinpoché, such as LakeBorn Vajra and Dorjé Drolö. On dakini days, rituals are performed relatedto the dakini, such as Yeshé Tsogyal and the Black Wrathful Goddess(Tröma Nakmo). The tsok lu, song of tantric gatherings, is a specific type of gur, or songof realization (Skt: doha). Gurs are songs that manifest the realization of afully realized being, directly, spontaneously, without pre-meditation, car-rying with them profound meaning using inspiring verse and melody.Songs of tantric gatherings are songs of realization that are sung specifi-cally at a tantric feast gathering. Both songs of realization and songs oftantric gatherings can originate either as a spontaneously written work or132Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"as a song spontaneously sung. This section contains the songs of tantricgatherings that are the manifestation of Dudjom Rinpoché’s realization.This song is then sung with an inspiring, beautiful melody as an offeringof realization to the vajra master at the same time the symbolic substancesof food and drink are offered. The next four songs are called gur, songs of realization. The first song iscalled The Wall Songand was first sung by His Holiness while construct-ing the Great Copper-Colored Mountain Temple in his homeland ofKongpo, in Buchu, Tibet. This temple is modeled after the one of the samename in Guru Rinpoché’s pure land. I can imagine the joy of everyonesinging this inspiring verse as they built this sacred temple for the benefitof all sentient beings during happy times in southeastern Tibet before theirexodus. The next four are beautiful, simple songs of realization of a wanderingyogi—Dudjom Rinpoché—using the natural poetic imagery drawn fromTibet’s expressive landscape; they are rich in blessings from the practiceand realization of countless fully enlightened male and female yogins. Theyremind me of the beautiful songs sung by the great yogin from the Rep-kong region of Tibet, Shabkar. I highly recommend reading his autobiog-raphy The Life of Shabkar, brimming with delicious songs of realization.78The final song of realization, called The Magical Play of the OriginalState: A Song and Dance of Sublime Aspiration, is nothing short of anamazing, profound, poetic song of realization. It demonstrates the vast,limitless, pure view of the Great Perfection as it penetrates deep into ourhearts. This song does not sing aboutthe ultimate point of view, it isthisview, brought directly home to us, triggering recognition of our own pureawareness.To conclude this section I have added a song of tantric gathering writtenby Dudjom Lingpa—His Holiness’s previous incarnation—that comes fromthe Black Wrathful Goddess (Tröma) cycle of revealed teachings. I couldnot resist including it. It is extremely beautiful. In practice it is accompa-nied by a melody that originated in the wisdom deity’s pure land, and it isbased upon the five perfections: the perfect time, place, teacher, retinue, andDharma, as described in the song itself.Introduction: Songs of Realization. . .133Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Celebration of Fortunate Ones:A Compilation of the Cycle of Songs of Realization and Songs of Tantric GatheringsWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 136"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"1.

The few prayers that I omitted are ones Dudjom Rinpoché wrote atthe request of students for a supplication prayer to his or her Lama. Faith and devotion are key prerequisites for the practice of the Vajrayanaand Great Perfection. They are also the very foundation and path that nat-urally contain within them the result of full enlightenment. As the omnis-cient Longchenpa writes in Resting in the Magical Display:92In guru yoga, however, the path [of faith and devotion], by itsvery nature alone, awakens the realization of the natural statewithin one and brings liberation. For that reason guru yoga isthe most profound of all paths.Faith and devotion protect us from getting lost in the labyrinth of sam-sara. They enable the Dharma to penetrate our being so that our practicedoes not remain superficial, merely skin deep; and they rapidly and safelytransport us along the noble path up to its final step, that step that can onlybe taken through direct recognition of our true nature that is always pres-ent, has always been present, and will always be present.It is important to understand that our faith and devotion are not onlydirected to the “outer” Lama. There are three aspects to the guru: outer,inner, and secret. The outer guru is your master in the flesh before you. Theinner guru is the Dharma received from the outer guru. The secret guru isyour mind’s true nature, pure awareness, fully enlightened Buddhahood.

The outer guru [your guru] is the same asGuru Rinpoché who has taken form. The inner guru is theDharma he has given that has arisen from his realization. Theseinstructions can lead us to the discovery and unveiling of ourown Buddha-potential. As practice is established and the fruitionbegins to materialize, the realization of the secret guru dawns asnone other than our own all-knowing wisdom awareness mind.(p. 41)The supplication prayers section contains three parts: 1. four prayers placed by His Holiness before the actual supplicationprayers section: a prayer based upon the life and liberation of DudjomLingpa, His Holiness’s past incarnation; a prayer in verse to His Holi-ness’s teachers, containing a description in prose of the empower-ments, textual transmissions, and empowerments received from each;a prayer based upon His Holiness’s past incarnations; and a conciseone-verse version of the previous prayer2. prayers of the genre “Calling the Lama from Afar”3. various supplication prayers to Dudjom Rinpoché that he himselfwrote as requested by his studentsThe supplication prayers contained within this collection help engenderfaith and devotion toward your Lama, inspiration for our spiritual lives,and fortitude in the face of difficulties encountered in the ups and downsof our daily life. The first prayer, based upon the life and liberation of Dudjom Lingpa, ispart of an important genre of Tibetan literature—that of namthar (rnamthar) or accounts of the lives and liberation of realized Lamas—which area crucial part of a disciple’s training. These biographies trace the lives ofrealized masters and describe their travails (if any), trainings, spiritual expe-riences, and complete realization. Quite often these books also containteachings in the form of songs of realization or of instructions sung for thelocal people that the Lamas would encounter. As Matthieu Ricard writes inthe introduction to The Life of Shabkar: 162Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 162"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Tibetan hagiographies are called namthar, which means “perfect,or complete, liberation.” A namtharis not only the detailedaccount of a saintly person’s life, but the description of his or herjourney to liberation: a narrative and a teaching as well. Morethan any other teaching, in fact, a namtharleaves a deep impres-sion on the reader’s mind. Far from abstract considerations, itputs in our hands a chart to guide us on the journey, a testimonythat the journey can be accomplished, and a powerful incentive toset out quickly on the path. Namthars of recent masters remindone that these accounts are not ancient fairy tales; they demon-strate that, even in our time, there are accomplished beings whoare living examples of enlightenment.93My Lamas highly recommend reading life stories of realized masters,and the following are available in English (see Bibliography for details):941.Guru Rinpoché: His Life and Times2.The Lady of the Lotus-Born(Yeshé Tsogyal’s life story of liberation)3.The Lives and Liberation of Princess Mandarava4.The Life of Shabkar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin5.The Life of Milarepa6.The Autobiography of Jamgön Kongtrul7.Masters of Meditation and Miracles(of the Longchen Nyingtik tra-dition)8.The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa KunleyThe prayer at hand, based on Dudjom Lingpa’s life story, is a sub-genre—a prayer based upon these life stories of liberation—written in verse, inspir-ing us to attain that same realization and requesting blessings that we willattain it. Through reciting this prayer with genuine faith and devotion, theblessings of Dudjom Lingpa’s wisdom mind are transmitted to our mind.In the next work, Dudjom Rinpoché praises his teachers in verse andthen lists in prose the teachings, textual transmissions, and empowermentshe received from each one. I find that reading Dudjom Rinpoché’s list of histeachers and their rich variety of instruction inspires faith and confidencein this amazing fully realized being. This text is also an important referencedocument to which I like to return periodically. Introduction: Supplication Prayers (gsol ’debs)163Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 163"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The third prayer is based upon Dudjom Rinpoché’s past incarnations.This is an inspiring prayer that all followers of his New Treasures traditionrecite before beginning meditation. The last prayer in this section is a con-cise version of this past incarnation prayer.The second series of prayers belong to the genre “Calling the Lama fromAfar.” These are my favorite prayers. I can’t count the number of timeswhen in personal retreat I would begin my session with the prayer called“In the depth of my heart” only to notice at some point that hours hadpassed and I had not yet begun the main practice! I find these prayers pow-erful, pure conduits to direct all my energy and feeling, without the needto figure something out: One can just pray and sing from the heart. It is avery simple practice. My Lama always taught us that, in the privacy of ourretreat cabin or practice place, we can sing and chant these devotional songsfrom the heart, in whatever melody we like, but notto do this in earshotof others as a way of boasting our faith or realization. Supplication prayers such as these are actually a form of guru yoga, theessential element needed to attain full enlightenment in this lifetime. AsLama Tharchin Rinpoché writes:According to the Vajrayana view, guru yoga is the quintessentialpractice for attaining liberation. All Buddhas became enlightenedby following their teacher’s precious instructions. So the guru isconsidered even more important than the Buddha because with-out the guru there is no way to achieve Buddhahood. When theguru’s instructions have penetrated the student’s heart, this isthe same as finding a precious wish-fulfilling jewel in your hand.Someone who has received the guru’s mind transmission has nochoice but to attain enlightenment, just as someone falling downa steep mountain totally out of control has no choice but to fallall the way to the bottom.The eighty-four mahasiddhas in India and Guru Rinpoché’stwenty-five main disciples in Tibet, the treasure-finders, aware-ness-holders, and accomplished enlightened sublime beings, allbecame enlightened through the mind transmission of theirgurus. This unbroken lineage has been passed from the primor-dial Buddha, Samantabhadra, to our own root Lama, who is theessence of all Buddhas of the ten directions and the three times.164Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"All siddhis [spiritual attainments] and blessings are carried andpassed through this lineage. Because the path of guru yoga is sodeeply profound, there is no doubt that if you practice it, youwill become enlightened. (p. 38)His Holiness gives the following instruction preceding the prayer called“Blessings Swiftly Received”:The principal task of those seeking to reach the state of omnis-cience in this lifetime is to see the master who grants you pro-found instructions that bring you to spiritual maturity andliberation as the Buddha incarnate, lord of all mandalas. Inspiredwith uncontrived intense yearning and devotion, pray in thisway, as if calling out for help from afar.An example of the devotional aspect of this genre of prayers can be foundin the prayer “In the depth of my heart”:In the depth of my heartAt the center of my faith’s blossoming thousand-petalled lotus,You reside forever in delightAnd always bless me.Glorious lord Héruka,Jigdral Yeshé Dorjé,You are the essence of all the Victorious Ones..Of this my heart is sure.With intense, unbearable yearning,I single-mindedly pray to you:Bring me to maturity and liberationWith your nectar of blessing, empowerment, and attainments.The unique aspect of these “Calling the Lama from Afar” prayers is thatsome prayers emphasize the ultimate Lama: our own enlightened mind.The prayer “In the depth of my heart” continues:Introduction: Supplication Prayers (gsol ’debs)165Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 165"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"I cry out from afarWith overwhelming longing for you, my Lama,Yet I cannot find youApart from this, my original mind.When there is no one to hear my prayersNor anyone to voice them,Why should I invent supplicationsWith forced, clinging contrivance?Conceptionless naked empty awareness,Vivid yet indefinable—This I recognize as my ultimate Lama,Indestructible wisdom (Yeshé Dorjé).95In the original ground of the naturally settled state,Supreme constant abiding in primordial presence,I need not call my Lama from afarNor search for you nearby.In the essential nature beyond my mind, all-inclusive awakening,Delusion is unheard of,Let alone transcendence of sorrow.It is an endless expanse of evenness and exaltation.Whatever arises is dharmakaya’s pervasive manifestation,Blessings beyond understanding.Enter this yogin’s heart—How wonderful and amazing!In the third part of this section there are a variety of supplication prayersto Dudjom Rinpoché, prayers to Guru Rinpoché, and a prayer based uponthe series of names that Dudjom Rinpoché had in previous lives, allrequested by his disciples.Praying to the Lama in this way blesses us, accomplishing our goals andwishes in accord with the Dharma. Supplicating in this way is a very prac-tical and direct approach to attain enlightenment in this very life. It protects166Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"us from a nihilistic attitude based upon mere intellectualism that will neveraccomplish our spiritual goals; will never protect us when the chips aredown; and will never lead to realization in a million years. Therefore, thesesupplication prayers are the very bedrock of Vajrayana and Great Perfec-tion practice. As Lama Tharchin Rinpoché writes :Have pure faith, devotion, and confidence in this [guru yoga] asa practice. This means genuinely feeling the guru’s inconceivablequalities of kindness and wisdom. Direct instructions from theguru can reveal your own Buddha-nature, which has been ob -scured in samsara for countless lifetimes. Open your heart andtrust in this. Thinking of the guru’s qualities, how amazing andextraordinarily fortunate you are to have met a teacher like this,you may feel the hair on your body stand up or you may crywithout control. Experiences will arise and suddenly your mindwill change to pure awareness. All normal phenomena will cease.Meditation experiences will arise effortlessly and spontaneously.So when practicing, do not mouth the words mindlessly or with-out feeling but rather generate devotion, the heart essence ofguru yoga.

Theseprayers come from the aspiration prayers section called The Ship ofEntirely Pure Benefit and Happiness: A Compilation of Aspiration Prayersfrom Dudjom Rinpoché’s Collected Works, vol. ah, pp. 427–79. Aspiration prayers are often a teaching together with the aspiration forits attainment. For instance, in the introductory verse above, we are taughtthat our ordinary mind does not see things truly because it is like a “decep-tive illusion.” If one is having an hallucination—the invention of a real-ity—then it doesn’t really matter what we decide upon as right or wrongbecause it is simply the deceptive, fabricated world we created. Therefore,it is unnecessary to involve ourselves with the eight worldly concerns thatare related to our hallucination: gain and loss; praise and blame; pleasureand pain; fame and infamy. The world we take to be real is merely a fabri-cation of our intellect. The final line, “May I persevere in my practice of thesublime Dharma,” is the aspiration to practice hard in order to realize thetruth revealed in the preceding lines.Aspiration prayers are extremely important in the context of Buddhism,because through reciting them from the heart, fired by faith and devotion,the blessings of these wisdom words of sublime beings enter us and touchour very being. These aspirations draw the object of our prayers towardus, or perhaps it is more accurate to say that these prayers draw the ulti-mate goal—the realization of our true nature, Buddha—out of us. Often I wish I could move beyond just “understanding” the teachings,for the teachings and experiences gained to become part of me, only to findthat when difficult circumstances arise, I suffer like a person who doesn’tpractice at all. Aspiration prayers remedy this. When recited genuinely andWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 253"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"purely, without ulterior motives, these teachings penetrate deeply, and theattainment of the goal of one’s aspiration is not a matter of if, but when.This is why my Lamas emphasize repeatedly the utmost importance offaith, devotion, and the recitation of genuine prayers of aspiration and sup-plication for all Vajrayana and Great Perfection practitioners. One’s prac-tice then becomes genuine, very juicy, as opposed to intellectual and verydry, like a kind of hobby or form of entertainment.The first two writings are exquisite prayers to be reborn in the pure landof Guru Rinpoché, the Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain. The first waswritten by Dudjom Rinpoché following a visionary experience in whichhe actually went to the Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain on the dakiniday of the second lunar month. I hope the translation can transmit some ofthe beauty and profound meaning of the original text.The third work included in this section—“The Sublime Quintessence:An Aspiration Prayer of the Vital Points of Instruction”—is one of myfavorite writings of His Holiness. He states in the colophon that he wrotethis prayer for himself by synthesizing the heart advice of past wisdommasters. It really goes to the heart of the matter in poignant poetic verse,such as:Without seeing awareness, like a stainless crystal,Meditation with grasping and effort will not collapse.Not seeking this constant companion elsewhere,May I persevere in my practice of the sublime Dharma!When times are tough, this prayer never fails to help me through diffi-culties in my life or in my practice. When all is well, it invariably uplifts andinspires me, laying bare what is meaningful and authentic, as the superfi-cial things I take so seriously naturally fade away...I included the fourth selection because it is a powerful, inspiring, andbeautiful aspiration prayer that I wanted to make available. The sixth, “AnAspiration Prayer Related to Bringing the Intermediate State into thePath,” is a very important prayer, especially for those of us in the Westwho tend to avoid anything related to death. We banish sickness, old age,and death to nursing homes, out of our sight and mind, to the point thateven aging must be hidden behind the mask of cosmetic surgery. This prayer is both a teaching on the intermediate state that awaits us all254Wisdom Nectar254Wisdom NectarWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 254"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"and also a practical prayer that can be recited as our own death nears or atthe impending death of a loved one. It is a concise and practical teaching onthe death process and the intermediate state leading to rebirth, and a verypowerful aspiration prayer that guarantees to a faithful individual libera-tion or a favorable rebirth in the next life.The seventh and final selection is an important and useful prayer, beau-tifully written in verse—as are all of His Holiness’s writings—that is an aidto one’s daily practice.Introduction: Aspiration Prayers (smon lam)255Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 255"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 256"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Ship of Entirely Pure Benefit and Happiness:A Compilation of Aspiration PrayersWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 257"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New 6/30/09 11:21 AM Page 258"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"1.

Let’s see how thisand His Holiness’s other heart advice teachings fit into the world of Bud-dhist teachings. The Nyingma tradition classifies all Buddhist teachingsinto nine vehicles, based on the capacity of individual students: Three causal vehicles:✦the Hearer Vehicle (Shravakayana)✦the Solitary Sage Vehicle (Pratyekabuddhayana)✦the Bodhisattva Vehicle (Bodhisattvayana)Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 291"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Three resultant vehicles of Vajrayana, divided into six sections: Three lower tantras:✦Kriyatantra✦Upatantra (also referred to as Caryatantra)✦Yogatantra Three higher tantras:✦Mahayoga✦Anuyoga✦AtiyogaThere are three classes of Atiyoga:✦Mind Class (sems sde)✦Vast Expanse Class (klong sde)✦Pith Instruction (upadesha)Class (man snag sde)It is not that the Pith Instruction Class is considered to be the “best”teachings as opposed to the many “inferior” teachings found in the lowervehicles. All of Buddha’s teachings are considered sublime, rich in specialqualities that lead us away from life’s sufferings and away from theinevitable suffering one experiences going from one life to the next andlead to higher and higher vehicles until full liberation is realized throughGreat Perfection. The Pith Instruction Class is the most sublime of thealways sublime teachings of Buddha.In order to see where his Holiness’s heart advice teachings fit into theworld of Buddhist teachings, we will briefly review in four sections the dis-tinguishing features of these nine vehicles: 1.

They also hold to thebelief that phenomena are made of indivisible particles, so they do notbelieve in the egolessness of phenomena. Their practice includes medita-tion on the nine disgusting things and the sixteen impermanences. Theirconduct consists of observing the two hundred and fifty monastic vows ofthe Vinaya. The result is attainment of the state of an arhat, or foedestroyer.Solitary SagesAccording to the vehicle of the Solitary Sages, the view is the egolessnessof the self, and partial realization of the egolessness of phenomena sincethey believe that phenomena have no inherent nature, though they stillbelieve phenomena are made of indivisible particles. Their practice is tomeditate in reverse order on the twelve interdependent links of causation.Their conduct is similar to that of the Hearers. The result is attainment ofthe state of a Solitary Sage (pratyekabuddha).BodhisattvasAccording to the vehicle of the Bodhisattvas, the view is the egolessness ofself and phenomena. As a manifestation of this, one practices the six or tenperfections312and the four means of positively influencing others.

The result is the attainmentof the two kayas.321VajrayanaAs we have seen, there are six vehicles within the category of Vajrayana.Three outer tantras: 1. Kriyatantra2. Upatantra (also referred to as Caryatantra)3. Yogatantra And three inner tantras:1. Mahayoga2. Anuyoga3. AtiyogaOuter TantrasKriyatantra According to Kriyatantra, the view is that all phenomena are withoutessence. The activity is to keep very clean and utilize the three whites andthree sweets.322The practice involves self-visualization as the commitmentbeing (dam tshig pa), while visualizing the wisdom being (ye shes pa) in thesky in front. The relationship is like that of a subject to a king. One thenreceives blessings and spiritual attainments from the king-like wisdomdeity in front. The path involves making offerings to the wisdom deity.The result is to attain the state of Vajradhara in sixteen lifetimes.UpatantraAccording to Upatantra, the view is to realize incisive knowledge (shes rab)without essence. The practice is basically the same as in Kriyatantra, self-visualization of oneself as the commitment being and visualization of the294Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 294"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"wisdom being in front. The relationship is like that of a friend or sibling.One receives blessings and spiritual attainments in this way. The result isattainment of the state of Vajradhara of the four families323in seven life-times.Yogatantra According to Yogatantra, the ultimate view is that all phenomena are com-pletely free of elaborated characteristics and are empty luminosity. Whileall phenomena are in essence the nature of phenomena (dharmata), fromthe perspective of relative truth they are the mandalas of deities. The activ-ity is not primarily concerned with cleanliness, as with the Kriyatantra andUpatantra. The focus is more upon the practice of meditation on the gen-eration and completion stages, in which practitioners visualize themselvesas the commitment being and invoke the wisdom being in front, whichthen dissolves into themselves. This is like water being poured into water.The result is attainment of the state of Vajradhara in three lifetimes.Distinction between Outer and Inner TantrasTulku Thondup, in Buddhist Civilization in Tibet, clearly and conciselyexplains the difference between the outer and inner tantras:In the outer tantras the distinction between the Two Truths ismaintained, divinities are not visualized with their female con-sorts, the five meats are not taken, and one does not attain thefinal result in this lifetime. In the inner tantras the Two Truths areheld to be inseparable, all phenomena are equal, the five meatsand five nectars are taken, the divinities are visualized with theirconsorts, and the final result can be attained in this life. Thetantras of these three yanas are the special and distinctiveNyingmapa practices.324Inner TantrasMahayogaAccording to Mahayoga, the view is the inseparability of appearances andemptiness. The method is to meditate on all appearances as being the man-dala of the wisdom deity.

The result is the attain-ment of enlightenment in one lifetime or in the intermediate state (bardo).AnuyogaAccording to Anuyoga, the view is to establish the three mandalas: theunborn mandala of the female consort Buddha Kuntu Zangmo, the wis-dom mandala of the male consort Buddha Kuntu Zangpo, and the offspringof their inseparable union, the mandala of Great Exaltation. The conduct isto abide in evenness. The practice is that of the path of liberation and thepath of skillful means, which includes working with channels (rtsa), vitalenergy (rlung), and essence (thig le). The result is the attainment ofenlightenment in one lifetime.AtiyogaAccording to Atiyoga, the Great Perfection, the view is that all phenomenaare primordially and spontaneously enlightened. The conduct is to be with-out acceptance or rejection, since all phenomena are the display of dhar-makaya. The practice is that of Cutting through Solidity (khregs chod),which is related to primordial purity (ka dag); and Direct Vision of Reality(thod rgal), which is related to spontaneous presence (lhun grub).Detailed Review of the Resultant Vehicles of VajrayanaAs the writings of Dudjom Rinpoché relate mostly to the resultant vehicleof Vajrayana, it may be helpful to take a detailed look at these six Vajrayanavehicles. This detailed review is entirely based upon Dudjom Rinpoché’swork The Festival of Delight in Which the Expression of Eloquent Teach-ings Manifest,325through the use of direct quotations and paraphrasingfrom the original Tibetan text.There are six vehicles within the category of Vajrayana. The main attrib-ute that makes these vehicles superior to even the Bodhisattva Vehicle isthat the Bodhisattva Vehicle takes the cause of enlightenment—inherentBuddha-nature—as the path, whereas Vajrayana’s sublime quality is totake the result as the path. His Holiness writes:296Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 296"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Therefore, in the vehicle of characteristics [that is, the vehicle ofdiscourses, or Sutrayana] the nature of mind is simply known asthe cause of enlightenment. Since it is held that enlightenment isattained through the condition of the increase of the two accumu-lations, and since the qualities manifested through purification(that cause enlightenment) are made into the path, it is called thecausal vehicle (rgyu’i theg pa). Therefore, it is accepted that causeand result occur sequentially.According to the vehicle of tantra (sngags kyi theg pa), thenature of mind primordially and naturally abides as the essenceof the result, the embodiment of the wisdom bodies and wisdoms.Therefore, the nature of mind is established as the ground thatexists within oneself in this present moment as the object to beattained. Entering into the realization of reality, as it is, removestemporary incidental stains. The nature of mind is established asthe path from the perspective of recognition. It is established asthe result from the perspective of actualizing the ground itself. Infact, since one does not distinguish a sequence in which a preced-ing cause is followed by a result, it is called the Resultant Vehi-cle (’bras bu’i theg pa) and Vajrayana (rdo rje theg pa). It is saidin the Secret Essence(gsang snying):In any of the four times and ten directionsThe perfect Buddha will not be found.The nature of mind is the perfect Buddha.Do not search for Buddha anywhere else.And,The most secret definitive resultConstitutes the path.Dudjom Rinpoché writes that in general, the extraordinary vehicles—those of Mantrayana326—are explained according to their:1. essence (ngo bo)2. definition of terms (nges tshig)3. classification (dbye ba)An Explanation of the Nine Vehicles297Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 297"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Explanation of the Tantric Vehicles According to Their EssenceRegarding the explanation of the tantric vehicles from the perspective ofessence, Dudjom Rinpoché writes:The teacher, Dorjé Chang, who taught the collection of teachings(sde snod) of the great vehicle of mantra, observed that cause andresult are inseparable and spontaneously accomplished, manifest-ing as the nature of the truth of origination, which is the truth ofthe path; and as the nature of the truth of suffering, which is thetruth of cessation. Therefore, with respect to action (byed las),the result is swiftly accomplished by practicing without acceptingor rejecting anything within the natural state (gnas lugs) of theoriginal ground (gzhi). Explanation of the Tantric Vehicles According to the Definition of TermsDefinition of MantraRegarding the explanation of the tantric vehicles from the perspective ofdefining the terms, what we in the West usually refer to as tantric or Vajra-yana Buddhism is usually referred to in Tibetan as Secret Mantra (gsangssngag), and in Sanskrit as the path of Mantrayana. This is why DudjomRinpoché now gives an explanation of the Sanskrit word mantra: The [Sanskrit word] mana,meaning “mind” [yid], and traya,meaning “protection” [skyob], become mantra, by combining thesyllables, and from these words comes “protecting the mind” [yidskyobin Tibetan].Definition of Collection of the Awareness-holdersThe collection of Buddha’s Word (bka’) related to the Mantrayana is calledthe Collection(sde snod; pitaka) of the Awareness-holders(rig ’dzin;vidyadhara) and also the Collection of the Vajrayana(rdo rje theg pa).According to Dudjom Rinpoché, dé-nö(sde snod) is the Tibetan translationof the Sanskrit pitaka, meaning “basket,” or “container.” It has been trans-lated above as “collection.” It is said that the collections of the three lower298Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 298"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"vehicles—of the hearers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas—are gatheredand perfected within the Awareness-holder, or Vajrayana, Collection. Tosupport this assertion, Dudjom Rinpoché cites the Tantra of the ExtensiveVersion of the Magical Net(sgyu ’phrul drwa ba rgyas pa):As for the King of Awareness itself, which realizes the meaning ofevenness:Just as all rivers flow into the vast ocean,In these vast skillful means that realize the unexcelled ultimatemeaning,The inconceivable vehicles of liberation are all gathered.The term “awareness-holder” (rig ’dzin) has many different meanings.According to Dudjom Rinpoché, in the context of the Mahayoga, aware-ness-holders are classified as four kinds: 1. awareness-holder of complete maturity (rnam smin rig ’dzin)2. awareness-holder with the power over longevity (tshe dbang ba’irig ’dzin)3. awareness-holder of Mahamudra (phyag chen po’i rig ’dzin)4. awareness-holder of spontaneous presence (lhun grub rig ’dzin)Dudjom Rinpoché explains why the collection of Buddha’s Word (bka’)related to the Mantrayana is called the Collection of Awareness-holders(rig pa ’dzin pa’i sde snod) as follows:It is called the “collection of awareness-holders” either because itis the basis of what an awareness-holder should study, or becausethey who enter this vehicle come to attain these common andsupreme accomplishments.Definition of VajrayanaThese six vehicles of Mantrayana are sometimes referred to as the Vajra-yana, a name with which many Western practitioners are familiar. DudjomRinpoché defines the Sanskrit word vajrayana based on its Tibetan transla -tion, dorjé tekpa(rdo rje theg pa). Dorjéis understood to mean “indivisible”(mi phyed pa) and “indestructible” (mi shigs pa). That which is indivisibleAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles299Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 299"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"never moves from the nature of mind, which is the natural state (gnaslugs), no matter how samsara or enlightenment displays itself (snangtshul). Dudjom Rinpoché explains the meaning of the word “indestructible” asfollows:The mind of all Buddhas is indestructible because it is the essenceof the nature of phenomena, which cannot be destroyed by anyspiritual teaching based upon characteristics (mtshan mar gyurpa’i chos). Since it is similar to a dorjé, the wisdom mind of allBuddhas is called “dorjé” [indivisible and indestructible] andabides as the essence of mantra, as previously explained. The termtekpa,“vehicle,” is used both literally and metaphorically, becauseit is either the support for the attainment of the mind of all Bud-dhas, or else the path traversed.Definition of TantraAnother term frequently used to refer to the Vajrayana is the Sanskrit wordtantra,and its Tibetan translation gyü(rgyud), which according to DudjomRinpoché conveys the meaning of mind protection (sems skyob). Tantrahasboth the meaning of protecting the mind as well as of continuity. DudjomRinpoché explains the meaning of this important term as follows. Tantrameans “mind protection” as it comes from two Sanskrit words, cetanaandtraya. Cetanais related to mind, while trayameans “protection.” Dudjom Rinpoché cites the Commentary on Difficult Points EntitledEndowed with Wisdom:It is called “tantra” (rgyud) because it protects (skyob) the mindfrom thoughts. It is called the “tantric collection” (rgyud sde)because they form the collection (tshogs) or class (rigs) of thetantras (rgyud).Tantra also refers to continuity, and is likened to the continuity of thestrings of a lute (pi wam). Dudjom Rinpoché writes:It is also called “tantra” because it contains the naturally purenature of phenomena of the mind from sentient beings to Bud-300Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 300"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"dha, through the ground, path, and result, continuously abidingwithout interruption. To give this scriptural support, Dudjom Rinpoché quotes from theMatrix of Mystery(Guhyasamaja-tantra; gsang ba ’dus pa):Tantra (rgyud) is called a continuity.There are three aspects of tantra:It is classified as ground, that ground’s nature, And that which cannot be taken away.The aspect of the ground’s nature (rang bzhin) is the cause.The ground is what is called skillful means (thabs) [that is, the path].Likewise, that which cannot be taken away is the result.The meaning of tantra (rgyud) is subsumed within these three.Explanation of the Tantric Vehicles According to ClassificationThere are numerous ways to classify the tantric vehicles. Dudjom Rinpochéstates that he uses the system that classifies the tantras into Kriyatantra,Caryatantra, Yogatantra, and Highest Yogatantra because this classifica-tion system presents these paths as methods for practitioners of differentlevels of ability. Dudjom Rinpoché quotes from the Vajra Tent(Vajrapan-jara-tantra; gur):Kriyatantra (bya ba’i rgyud) is for those of lowest faculties; Cary-atantra (spyod pa’i rgyud), for those who are superior; Yogatantra(rnal ’byor rgyud), for the supreme among sentient beings; andHighest Yogatantra (rnal ’byor bla med), for the highest. KriyatantraKriyameans action since it mainly teaches the activity of body and speech.Dudjom Rinpoché writes:Its view is that ultimately, there are noble qualities throughwhich one’s very nature is realized to be pure and without con-ceptual elaborations of the four extremes,327and besides that, rel-atively, appearances are viewed as having the characteristics ofAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles301Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 301"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"an utterly pure wisdom deity. One thereby uses the skillfulmeans of aspiring and striving toward spiritual attainment, whichis externally bestowed by the deity.The key aspect of meditation in this context is for the practitioner to seethe external deity as master and the practitioner as servant. Dudjom Rin-poché quotes from the Tantra of Self-Manifest Awareness(rig pa rangshar gyi rgyud):Wisdom deity and pure practitionerare seen as master and servant, respectively.Conduct, the activity of the Kriyatantra practitioner, is to please the deitythrough offerings, cleanliness, fasting, and other austerities. The result isthe attainment of the state of a vajra-holder in sixteen lifetimes.Dudjom Rinpoché lists some of the texts that set forth the practices ofKriyatantra: Tantra of the Dialogue with Subahu(dpung bzang); Tantra ofthe Emergence of Tara(sgrol ma ’byung ba); King of the Three Commit-ments(dam tshig gsum rgyal); and the Subjugation of Demons(’byung po’dul byed).CaryatantraThe key feature of Caryatantra (also known as Upatantra) is that it is prac-ticed with the view of Yogatantra and the conduct of Kriyatantra. To sup-port this point, Dudjom Rinpoché again quotes from the Tantra ofSelf-Manifest Awareness(rig pa rang shar gyi rgyud):Upatantra is as follows:The view is that of Yogatantra,And the conduct is that of Kriyatantra.Therefore, it is known as the tantra of both.In Upatantra, one practices meditation with characteristics by meditat-ing on and one-pointedly joining one’s mind to the syllables, mudras, andforms of the deities. Through this process, samadhi is stabilized. TheUpatantra practitioner also engages in yoga without characteristics by plac-ing the mind within ultimate reality. As the practitioner becomes accus-302Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 302"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"tomed to this, many provisional results occur, such as the attainment ofthe form of an awareness-holder. Ultimately, one actualizes the result of avajra-holder belonging to the four Buddha families (rigs bzhi rdo rje) eitherin five lifetimes or after one or three eons.According to Dudjom Rinpoché:The collections in which Upatantra is taught include the Mani-fest Enlightenment of Vairocana(rnam par snang mdzad mngonpar byang chub pa), the Empowerment of Vajrapani(phyang nardo rje dbang bskur ba), and so forth.Yogatantra Yogatantra emphasizes meditation, so it is called yogatantra. To supportthis with scripture, Dudjom Rinpoché quotes from Synopsis of the Illumi-nation of Suchness (de kho na nyid snang ba’i don bsdus):This tantra is called “yogatantra” because it principally teachessamadhi meditation.According to Dudjom Rinpoché, the view of Yogatantra is that the wis-dom blessing—ultimate realization of the nature of all phenomena freefrom elaborations as luminous emptiness—is seen relatively as the deity ofindestructible stainless space. The result is accomplished by endeavoring inthe acceptance of positive ideas and rejection of negative ones in relation tothat deity.In the approach of Yogatantra, one meditates on oneself as the deity anduses supporting conduct similar to that of Kriyatantra and Upatantra, suchas their emphasis on cleanliness. There are many provisional results asso-ciated with Yogatantra, such as becoming an awareness-holder of the Celes-tial Pure Land (mkha’ spyod rig pa ’dzin pa). The ultimate result is theattainment of Mahamudra in three or sixteen lifetimes. Afterward, Buddha-hood is gradually attained on the level of the five Buddha families’ pureland of Dense Array (rigs lnga stug po bkod).

In this way, they separate skillful means and wisdombecause they are ignorant regarding the natural state (gnas lugs) ofsupreme exaltation. The Tantras of Unsurpassable Union are known asthe “close path” (nye ba’i lam) and the “tantra of skillful means” (thabskyi rgyud). When one enters this path, one is then connected with theresult. Therefore, on the path of the Tantras of Unsurpassable Union, the threepoisons are not renounced as in the previous vehicles; instead, they arebrought onto the path. Dudjom Rinpoché writes:In other vehicles the three poisons are renounced; here, by hav-ing driven in the nail of the non-conceptual view, the three poi-sons are brought into the path without being rejected—desire asthe essence of empty exaltation, anger as the essence of emptyluminosity, and ignorance as the essence of empty awareness. Inthis way, the skillful means by which the extraordinary level ofoneness is accomplished in a single lifetime is amazing!The Tantras of Unsurpassable Union are also superior to the other vehi-cles in that they teach the male and female deities in union as the insepa-rability of skillful means and wisdom.Dudjom Rinpoché mentions that there are various classifications for theTantras of Unsurpassable Union, and according to the Nyingma traditionthey can all be subsumed within three subdivisions: 1. creation stage Mahayoga304Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 304"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"2. perfection stage Anuyoga3. Great Perfection stage AtiyogaCreation Stage MahayogaViewMahayoga (rnal ’byor chen po) is called the creation stage of tantra. Dud-jom Rinpoché defines Mahayoga as follows:Mahayoga, naljor chenpo[in Tibetan], is said to be far superior(chenpo) to outer Yogatantra because it connects (jor) the intel-lect to the meaning of non-duality [that is, genuineness (nal)].Within Mahayoga, although there are numerous classes of both thetantra collection and the sadhanacollection, Dudjom Rinpoché says that inthis exposition he will explain Mahayoga based upon the explanations asfound in the general tantra of the Magical Net(sgyu ’phrul drwa ba).328Thenatural state itself—the ground tantra (gzhi rgyud)—is established as theview to be realized. Dudjom Rinpoché explains:This view is not established through nominal, theoretical dialec-tics, but rather, it is established by three kinds of universally validcognition and must be realized through direct perception ofawareness itself.PathThe path of Mahayoga comprises two stages: skillful means and liberation. Path of Skillful MeansThrough skillful means the practitioner brings the three poisons into thepath and attains liberation. Dudjom Rinpoché describes this and gives awarning:Principally, the unique quality of skillful means is that one en -gages in the fearless conduct of practice directly subjugating thethree poisons without rejecting them, and when one practicesendowed with confidence in the view, not only is one not fettered,An Explanation of the Nine Vehicles305Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 305"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"one instead swiftly attains the result of liberation. On the otherhand, if one cannot practice in this way, not only will liberationnot be attained, instead there will be the great danger of fallinginto the lower realms. Therefore, there is great danger, as whenpreparing mercury.Path of LiberationThe path of liberation is principally established through the three incisiveknowledges: the wisdoms of study, reflection, and meditation. View on the Path of LiberationThe view is that through realization, the mind’s fetters are purified andliberated within the vast expanse of the nature of phenomena. There is notthe unique quality of speed as in the path of skillful means, the danger isless, but there is no difference in the result.Dudjom Rinpoché describes the path of liberation as consisting of threeaspects:The path of liberation has three aspects: The view characterized as knowing is the cause;The samadhi characterized as entering the path is the condition;The result brought about by the path is that of an awareness-holder.The first has been described above. The second aspect of the path of lib-eration is samadhi. This includes devotional meditation and definitive per-fection. The former [devotional meditation] is meditation as it brings intothe path some aspects of mental images [of the deity] and devotion towardthat deity. The latter refers to training until the five experiences of samadhiof both the creation and perfection stages are brought to completion.Dudjom Rinpoché quotes from Vimalamitra’s Commentary on Medita-tion in Mudra:329Agitation, attainment, familiarity, stability, and culminationare the five ways in which meditation arises. Meditation on the Path of LiberationAs for meditation on the path of liberation, Dudjom Rinpoché cites theSecret Essence Tantra(gsang ba’i snying po):306Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 306"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Through their maturation during the stages of coming into existence,The aspects of the entrance are established to be five:Because all that is substantial is awareness,Death is [the moment of] the ultimate truth,The intermediate state before rebirth is relative truth,And the three stages of rebirth are non-dual truth.Dudjom Rinpoché explains how Mahayoga perfectly shows the path thatpurifies at one and the same time death, the intermediate state, and thethree stages of rebirth, and then describes the paths that correspond to thisprocess. The path that is in accord with death’s clear light is great emptiness.The path that is in accord with the intermediate state is great compassion.The paths that are in accord with the three stages of rebirth are, respec-tively, the sole mudra, the elaborate mudra, and the accomplishment of theassembled mandala [of deities].Two modes of purification: The coarse creation stage and the subtle perfection stageIn relation to meditation in Mahayoga, there are two modes of purification:✦purification through the coarse creation stage (bskyed rim)✦purification through the subtle perfection stage (rdzogs rim)The Coarse Creation Stage.Dudjom Rinpoché explains that at the momentof death, the inner radiance of the dharmakaya manifests. In order to bringthis into the path, one meditates upon the samadhi of ultimate reality—dharmakaya free from conceptual elaborations. If the clear light is not rec-ognized, then one engages in the all-pervasive meditation on greatcompassion, the essence of the samadhi of all appearances, which are non-conceptual, that purifies temporary habits of the magic-like mental bodyduring the intermediate state.If one is not liberated during the intermediate state, then there are thecoarse and subtle aspects of the sole mudra that purifies habitual tenden-cies from the time of conception in the womb until the moment of birth.The samadhi of the causal basis—training in the seed syllables—is theessence of the process of purification of the intermediate state of takingexistence. This is done by training in the seed syllables of the wisdomdeities.

Thissection has three aspects: apprehending the ground of accomplishment bythe five aspects of excellence; doing the main practice with the fourbranches of approach and accomplishment; and demonstrating the time ofaccomplishing the result of an awareness-holder.The Subtle Perfection Stage of Mahayoga. Dudjom Rinpoché describes fivecorresponding ways of purification according to the subtle perfection stage. The first mode of purification is training that brings the previously men-tioned five experiences to completion through meditation. This is donethrough two methods of resting: 1. resting in the immediacy of awareness, and2. resting after insight.Training in the immediacy of awareness means to have the key pointrelated to the body, which is to abide in awareness so that while in medita-tion one will not even feel the prick of a thorn, since one rests in the freshstate of uncontrived awareness.Resting after insight is to rest in the state of awareness after recalling theview that one has studied and reflected upon.The second mode of purification is stamping the seal by not clinging tothe forms of emptiness nor to whatever clear light phenomena appear atnight.The third mode of purification is stamping whatever phenomena arisewith the sole seal of the wisdom deity’s body. This is related to the meltingbliss arising from the samadhi of beneficial great compassion that is impar-tial toward all phenomena.The fourth mode of purification is through the vast increase of wisdomdeity phenomena, to become accustomed to the deity’s body, perfectly and308Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 308"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"distinctly—the main deity, retinue, and assembly—that is indivisible withall phenomena.The fifth mode of purification relies on any mandala cluster in har-mony with the creation stage—elaborated or unelaborated—in whichmale and female yogins and the male and female central deities in unionare assembled; or the extremely unelaborated stage in which there is theinseparable union of the changeless great exaltation of the male wisdomconsort and the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects of the femalewisdom consort.ResultThe third aspect of the path of liberation is the result: to become an aware-ness-holder. Dudjom Rinpoché explains that through meditating on thepath of Mahayoga as previously described, the four kinds of awareness-holders included in the three untainted paths—of insight, meditation, andconclusion—are made manifest. The four kinds of awareness-holders are: ✦awareness-holder of maturation (rnam smin rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder with power over longevity (tshe dbang rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder of Mahamudra (phyag rgya rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder of spontaneous presence (lhun grub rig ’dzin) Dudjom Rinpoché also mentions five kinds of awareness-holders ofMahamudra:✦awareness-holder of indestructibility (rdo rje rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder of the wheel (’khor lo rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder of precious gems (rin po che rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder of the lotus (pad ma’i rig ’dzin)✦awareness-holder of the sword (ral gri’i rig ’dzin)Dudjom Rinpoché explains that the awareness-holder of spontaneouspresence—such as the Lord of Secrets, Vajrapani—is superior over all oth-ers and is the spontaneous presence of the five kayas.

Dudjom Rin-poché gives the following example from the Hévajra Tantra:You should kill living beings.In this case, “living beings” represents clinging to self, so the statementreally means that you should eliminate self-clinging.The fourth parameter, where the meaning is not implied but obvious, isgiven in the following example by Dudjom Rinpoché:You should not kill living beings.You should not tell lies.The fifth parameter is the literal meaning and refers to those texts thatshould be taken literally, such as ritual texts that include mandalas, burntofferings, tormas, and so forth.The sixth parameter is the non-literal meaning and refers to texts writ-ten in the symbolic language of the Buddhas. Dudjom Rinpoché gives theexample of the word ali-kali. This usually refers to the vowels (ali) andconsonants (kali) of the Tibetan alphabet, but is also code for sexual unionand liberation. Four Methods of InterpretationDudjom Rinpoché explains that the four methods of interpretation thatcharacterize the tantras are: 1. literal method2. general method3. concealed method4. ultimate methodFirst, the literal method is based on texts of grammar and logic. Second, the general method is of three kinds: 314Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 314"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"1. the general method that counteracts regret regarding having enteredand practiced lower vehicles2. the general method that counteracts regret regarding involvement inthe inner tantras due to thinking that the conduct involved with thesetantras is debased because it lacks cleanliness and other aspects ofpurity and so forth, as found in the lower vehicles3. the general method related to the creation stage, since creation stagemeditation is common to both the creation and perfection stages andincludes meditation on the celestial palaces, wisdom deities, and soforthThird, is the concealed method. This refers to teachings and practicesthat are concealed from novices so they do not create wrong views forthemselves. Fourth is the ultimate method. This refers to the conclusion of the path,which is the perfection stage of luminosity, or ultimate reality.Dudjom Rinpoché explains that these four methods of interpretation areutilized because a single phrase of vajra words can be understood accord-ing to the faculties of different practitioners, and without possessing thepith instructions, one cannot realize the real secret key point. If one pos-sesses these four methods to aid in the interpretation of a text, then one caneasily come to realize the wisdom mind of the secret Vajrayana.Great Perfection AtiyogaThe Great Perfection is the culmination of all paths to be traversed and thesummit of all vehicles. Dudjom Rinpoché explains the Great Perfection intwo sections: superiority of the Great Perfection over the lower vehiclesits classificationsSuperiority of the Great PerfectionDudjom Rinpoché explains that the Great Perfection is superior to thelower vehicles because:This king among vehicles holds stainless space—the originallypure nature of mind whose nature is clear light, the naturallypresent changeless self-manifest wisdom that is naturally andAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles315Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 315"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"spontaneously present in oneself—to be the original ground ofthe Great Perfection. In contrast, the eight lower vehicles are based upon intellectual con-trivance and fabrication. Dudjom Rinpoché explains that from the perspec-tive of the Great Perfection:The eight lower levels have intellectually fabricated and contrivedthat which is changeless solely due to fleeting thoughts thatnever experience what truly is. They apply antidotes to and rejectthat which is not to be rejected. They refer to as flawed that inwhich there is nothing to be purified, with a mind that desirespurification. They have created division, with respect to thatwhich cannot be obtained, by their hopes and fears that it can beobtained elsewhere. And they have obscured wisdom, which isnaturally present, by their efforts in respect to that which is freefrom effort and free from needing to be accomplished. Therefore,they have had no chance to make contact with genuine ultimatereality as it is (rnal ma’i de kho na nyid).Therefore, the natural Great Perfection, which refers to the nature ofmind that transcends mind, is superior to the eight lower vehicles, whichare created and fabricated by the mind. Dudjom Rinpoché further explains:In this way, the natural Great Perfection is present as the natureof mind that transcends ordinary mind, as the uncompoundedclear light of wisdom that is awareness, such as that all noblequalities of the essential nature are spontaneously present.It is this extremely rare and precious summit of all Buddhist teachings—the Great Perfection—that Dudjom Rinpoché is “placing in the palm ofour hand” in the text Essential Advice for Solitary Meditation Practice.Explanation of the Term “Great Perfection” (Dzogchen)Nowadays, the term “Great Perfection” is quite common among Buddhistpractitioners, but what does this term actually mean? Dudjom Rinpochéexplains it as follows:316Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 316"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"It is called the Great Perfection (Dzogchen) because it refers toself-manifest wisdom, unrestricted and without extremes, inwhich the meaning of all vehicles abides and is perfected(dzog)in a single essence; or it is called the Great Perfection because allenlightened phenomena are perfected(dzog) within the presentnatural state of awareness, the nature of phenomena, withoutdeliberate analysis by means of mental fixation.Definition of the Sanskrit TermAtiyoga(Highest Yoga)As for the definition of the word atiyoga, Dudjom Rinpoché writes:[The Sanskrit] word atimeans shintu in Tibetan [“very” or“extremely” in English]. It also carries the connotations of“supreme,” “highest,” “perfection,” “pinnacle,” and “innermostessence.” The [Sanskrit] word yogameans [in Tibetan] naljor(rnal ’byor) [ “union” in English]. Since it is the culmination ofall yogas it is called shintu naljor[in Tibetan, atiyogain San-skrit], the “highest yoga.” Since it is the essence of all aspects ofthe perfection stage (dzog rim), there is nothing else to be tra-versed higher than this. This is indicated by the word “great”[chenpoin Tibetan] since through it the unborn nature of phe-nomena—which is like the sky, extremely vast and difficult toexamine—is directly pointed out.ClassificationsDivisions of Atiyoga✦Atiyoga has three divisions:✦Mind Class (sems sde)✦Vast Expanse Class (klong sde)✦Pith Instruction Class (man ngag sde) Dudjom Rinpoché explains these as follows:The Mind Class teaches that all phenomena are liberated fromthe extreme of being an object of renunciation because they areAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles317Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 317"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"none other than the nature of mind. The Vast Expanse Classteaches that all conditioned phenomena are free of activity andare liberated from the extreme of needing antidotes because theyare perfectly encompassed within the vast expanse of the femaleBuddha Kuntu Zangmo, the nature of phenomena. The PithInstruction Class teaches that the defining characteristics of truthare liberated from both extremes—being an object of renuncia-tion or in need of an antidote—because they are establishedaccording to ultimate reality as it is.Mind Class (sems sde)Dudjom Rinpoché describes the Mind Class as follows:The philosophical approach of the Mind Class is that the com-pounded truth of the path—which is conditioned and fettered byfirm perceptions that cling to the stages of vehicles, the twotruths, the sixparamitas, the two stages, and so forth—is resolvedin vast stainless space, liberated from aspects of cause and result,virtuous and harmful actions, and acceptance or rejection, to bethe wisdom of great purity and evenness—the original stainlessspace of phenomena that is the nature of enlightened mind, or theessential nature of ultimate truth free from conceptual elabora-tion. To put it concisely, all phenomena that dualistically appearwithin subject and object are transcended.The distinctive attribute of the Mind Class is that mind is self-liberatedat the very moment it arises. Dudjom Rinpoché quotes from All-CreatingKing:Phenomenal existence, the universe and beings contained within,All Buddhas and sentient beingsAre created by mind...Dudjom Rinpoché summarizes the philosophical approach of the MindClass as follows:All conditioned phenomena that appear are perfected within thestainless space of enlightened mind—dharmata—without having318Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 318"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"to apply the seal of dharmata to all phenomena that appear. Theawareness of appearances as simply the display (rtsal) or play (rolpa) [of dharmata] accompanies them without identifying them assuch.Dudjom Rinpoché supports this by citing the glorious Naropa:The nature of diverse phenomenaIs dharmata, thereby inseparable.Therefore, in the luminous nature of mind—wisdom mind, In which [appearances and dharmata] are indivisible—Everything that appears is dharmata.The essence of everything that appearsIs seen as the very heart of wisdomAnd is inexpressible in its very essence.Classification of TextsDudjom Rinpoché explains that although the tantras of the Mind Class ofAtiyoga consist of millions of verses, they can be subsumed within variousclassification systems. For instance, they can be subsumed within the ThreeVast Expanses(klong gsum po): 1.Vast Expanse of the Inexpressibility of the Nature of Phenomena(chos nyid brjod du med pa’i klong) 2.Vast Expanse in Which the View Is Not Non-existent(lta ba min pamed pa’i klong)3.Vast Expanse in Which There Is No Conduct(spyod pa yin pa med pa’iklong)The Mind Class texts can also be classified as 1,003 supreme sections oftantras entitled: Fifty Unerring Nails of Dharmata (chos nyid la ’chugs pamed pa’i gzer bu lnga bcu); Five Hundred and Eleven Situations in WhichObjects Are Viewed as Mind(yul sems la lta ba’i gnas lnga brgya bcu gcig);Twenty Thousand Simultaneous Distinctions between Appearances andMind(snang sems cig char du shan ’byed pa khri phrag gnyis); Fifty Thou-sand Resolutions Regarding the View of Direct Vision(lta ba thod rgal dula bzla ba lnga khri); and One Thousand Situations That Cut through Con-cepts of Being in Meditation (sgom yod rtog pa gcod pa’i gnas chig stong).An Explanation of the Nine Vehicles319Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 319"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Vast Expanse Class (klong sde)Dudjom Rinpoché explains the Vast Expanse Class as follows:In the vast expanse of female Buddha Always Noble (KuntuZangmo)—self-manifest wisdom, the nature of phenomena—allconditioned phenomena that appear are simply the ornaments ofthat array’s manifestation in and of itself. Other than this, phe-nomena do not exist as bound or liberated nor as objects that ariseor their arising. Phenomena are not considered to appear as thedisplay or play of mind as in the Mind Class. The philosophicalapproach of the Vast Expanse Class is to establish with certaintythe infinity of primordial liberation without any analysis ofwhether they have dependent existence, lack existence, are non-existent, or whether they are pure or impure.To support this explanation, Dudjom Rinpoché cites the Lama Naropa’sMeans for Attaining Ultimate Reality As It Is (de kho na nyid sgrub pa’ithabs):Effortless, non-conceptual awareness—An uncontrived expanse of exaltation—manifests in and of itself.It manifests as the spontaneously present expanse of wisdom,Naturally occurring and pervasive as the sky.This enlightened mind’s display that manifests in and of itselfIs wisdom magic’s expanse of exaltation.It actually radiates as wisdom awareness-holders,Who are a self-occurring magical manifestation.Classification of TextsAs for the texts of the Vast Expanse Class, according to Dudjom Rinpochéthere are considered to be eleven thousand chapters and six million fourhundred thousand verses, subsumed under the titles of three thousandtantras that extensively teach the way of the Vast Expanse Class. These canbe included in the Eighty Thousand Aspects of Reaching a Final Decision(la bzla ba khri phrag brgyad). They are also subsumed within Tw e n t yThousand Aspects of Distinction(shan ’byed khri phrag gnyis). They can320Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 320"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"also be condensed within Nine Hundred Conclusions(’gag dgu brgya). Ifthe Two Thousand Essentials(gnad nyis stong) and the Fifty Nails(gzre bulnga bcu) are included, they are subsumed within three categories: Liber-ation from Activity (byas grol), Liberation in the Establishment [of Real-ity](bzhag grol), and Naked Liberation(cer grol).Pith Instruction Class (upadesha)Superiority over the Mind Class and the Vast Expanse ClassDudjom Rinpoché explains that the Pith Instruction Class is superior tothe Mind Class and the Vast Expanse Class. The Mind Class emphasizes theprofound aspect, emptiness rather than luminosity. There is not the real-ization of the display of luminosity as being the nature of phenomena. Thiscan lead to a subtle clinging to deliberate examination. In the Vast Expanse Class, although the profound and luminous aspectshave both been accomplished, thereby avoiding the pitfall of deliberateexamination that clings to the nature of phenomena, one can nearly becomelost in a pitfall on the side of emptiness. On the other hand, according toDudjom Rinpoché, the Pith Instruction Class is superior to both the MindClass and Vast Expanse Class because from its point of view, all phenom-ena appear from the spontaneous natural display (rtsal)—the radiant man-ifestation in and of itself of the primordially pure inexpressible essence,the great transcendence of ordinary mind—and are gathered within thestainless space that is the nature of phenomena free from elaborations. Dudjom Rinpoché cites the Supreme Array of Ati(a ti bkod pa chen po)to support this claim of the superiority of the Pith Instruction Class:O Vajrapani! If the Pith Instruction Class is not established,There will be those who cling to deliberate examinationAnd, in particular, those who will believe in nothing at all.Therefore, this definitive secret essence—Like a butter lamp amid darkness,Like an elephant among oxen,Like a lion among wild animals,Or like a horseman among those on foot—Is superior to them all.An Explanation of the Nine Vehicles321Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 321"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Dudjom Rinpoché further explains that the Pith Instruction Class is inno way a dualistic approach. It is inconceivable and inexpressible, and goesdirectly to the essential point. This is supported by citing Manjushri:Awareness is utterly luminous by nature,Originally pure as the sky.Primordially, the characteristics of phenomena have been abandoned.There is neither phenomena nor the nature of phenomena:It is similar to substanceless space,Free from all words and letters.Classification of the Pith Instruction ClassThe Pith Instruction Class can be classified into three categories: 1. random (kha ’thor)2. oral tradition (kha gtam)3. teaching that accords with its own textual tradition of the tantras(rgyud rang gzhung du bstan pa)RandomThe first is the random category of Pith Instructions. Dudjom Rinpochéwrites:Wisdom that transcends ordinary mind instantaneously mani-fests without regard for differentiation or exclusion. Its subdivi-sions are twofold: from the perspective of the establishment ofultimate reality there is the Pith Instruction That Concludes thePath (bzhag pa lam gyi mtha’ gcod pa’i man ngag); and from theperspective of liberation there is the Pith Instruction That Actu-alizes the Pure Path (grol ba tobs dag pa lam mngon gyur gyiman ngag). Oral TraditionThe second is the oral instruction category of Pith Instructions. DudjomRinpoché explains:Its essence is free from ordinary mind and is undeluded. Itsnature undermines the source of thoughts. Its characteristics are322Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 322"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"unidentifiable. Its subdivisions are twofold: the oral tradition thatpermeates all discourse (gleng ba yongs la bor ba’i kha gtam);and the oral tradition that unpredictably expresses in speech(khar phog dus med pa’i kha gtam). Teaching That Accords with Its Own Textual Tradition of the TantrasThe third category of Pith Instructions is the teaching that accords with itstantras’ own textual tradition. Dudjom Rinpoché explains:Its essence is that it is the source of all Buddha’s Words. Its natureis that since it is free of samsara and enlightenment, it is effort-less, without an object to accept or reject. Since the nature of phe-nomena does not abide in words or language, it is untouched bydebates about emptiness. The subdivisions of this category of Pith Instructions are fourfold: 1. n a manner of full summation of the view (lta ba sgang dril ba)2. in a manner of blood-letting that removes hindrances (gtar ga gegs sel ba)3. in a manner of revealing the hidden (gab pa ngon du phyung pa)4. in a manner of naturally clear explanations (bshad pa rang gsal gyitshul). Texts of the Pith Instruction ClassAs for the texts of the Pith Instruction Class, Dudjom Rinpoché writes thatin the Buddha’s Words it is said that there are infinite categories of PithInstruction texts. These categories include the four categories of the PithInstruction Class that are subsumed into the Three Vast Expanses:1. Vast Expanse of Ceaseless Display (rol pa ’gag pa med pa’i klong)2. Vast Expanse in Which There Is Nothing Not Liberated in OrdinaryMind (blo la ma grol ba med pa’i klong)3. Vast Expanse in Which the Essence Is Neither Good Nor Bad (ngo bola bzang ngan med pa’i klong)The essence of the Pith Instructions is also fourfold: 1. revealing the key point (gnad bkrol ba)An Explanation of the Nine Vehicles323Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 323"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"2. distilling the principles (’gag bsdam pa)3. pointing out [awareness] (ngo sprad pa)4. striking the manifest naturally vital point (mngon sum rang gnad ladbab pa)The View and Path of the Pith Instruction ClassAccording to the tradition of the Pith Instruction Class of the Great Perfec-tion, it is considered to be the essence, the heart of all teachings, because itdirectly uses one’s own awareness as the object of practice. Dudjom Rin-poché explains this as follows:One’s own awareness itself is the domain that is cultivated aswisdom. It transcends the mind that has the nature of the eightconsciousnesses of conditioned grasping (zag pa bcas pa’i nye barlen pa). Dudjom Rinpoché points out the necessity of directing one’s intentiontoward awareness that transcends mind and also points to the importanceof distinguishing between mind and wisdom. To emphasize this, DudjomRinpoché cites the scriptural authority of the Great Perfection tantra TheLion’s Perfect Display(seng ge rtsal rdzogs):Habitual tendencies in relation to mind and wisdom are insub-stantial.Although wisdom has been freed from all habitual tendencies,Mind amasses diverse habitual tendencies.If you do not distinguish between mind and wisdom,The root of objective phenomena is not cut through.Therefore, although the nature of phenomena is free of circum-stances, it becomes difficult to realize.A very special feature of the Pith Instruction Class is the four modes ofliberation:1. primordial liberation (ye grol)2. self-liberation (rang grol)3. naked liberation (cer grol)4. liberation from extremes (mtha’ grol) 324Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 324"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Dudjom Rinpoché explains these four modes of liberation as follows:This very awareness, from time immemorial, is primordially lib-erated because its very essence is untainted by samsaric phenom-ena so that the perpetual cause (nyer len gyi rgyu) of existencehas ceased.It is self-liberated because—uncontrived by any antidote—all that arises is liberated independent of any other liberatingactivities, like a snake’s knot naturally uncoiling. It is directly liberated, because all consciousnesses of theeight aggregates are naturally liberated with great instanta-neous lightening-like suddenness, without the duality of sub-ject and object.It is liberated from extremes because it does not abide withinthe three times or as anything knowable.Cutting through Solidity (Trekchö) and Direct Vision (Tögal) Dudjom Rinpoché now explains that for this to be appropriately realized,one must proceed upon two paths: Cutting through Solidity, or Trekchö(khregs chod), and Direct Vision of Reality, or Tögal(thod rgal). Cuttingthrough Solidity establishes the primordially pure abiding nature, whileDirect Vision of Reality establishes the spontaneously present visionaryexperiences. A detailed discussion of Cutting through Solidity and DirectVision of Reality is beyond the scope of this introduction and is bestreceived directly from a qualified Great Perfection master.Review of the Resultant VehiclesDudjom Rinpoché now reviews the outer and inner tantras in order “tofacilitate understanding.” Because much of this material is not actually cov-ered in the general overview just completed, and because it adds greatly toan understanding of the nine vehicles, it is worthwhile exploring this sec-tion.Distinction between the Outer and Inner TantrasThe first section of Dudjom Rinpoché’s review succinctly describes the dis-tinctions between the outer and inner tantras. There are five distinctionsAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles325Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 325"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"according to the Nyingma tradition as represented by Lord Dropukpa (rjesgro phug pa), who brought together the intention of the four pillars—thespiritual sons of Zurchungpa.330The five distinctions between the outer andinner tantras are by way of:✦view✦the way that spiritual attainment is received✦empowerments✦conduct✦results Distinction: ViewDudjom Rinpoché quotes Lord Dropukpa:As for the distinction of the view: In the inner tantric vehiclesthe nature of mind is realized to be the supreme nature (bdagnyid chen po); and in the outer tantric vehicles there is no suchrealization. As it is said in Indrabhuti’s Array of the Path(lamrnam bkod pa):Since those who hold to the three Buddha families and fiveBuddha families do not realize the supreme nature (bdagnyid chen po), I have spoken of them as being the same as the commonvehicles.331Distinction: How Spiritual Attainment Is ReceivedAs for the second distinction, how spiritual attainment is received: In theouter tantric vehicles spiritual attainment is requested by aspiring towardand attending upon the wisdom deity; in the inner tantric vehicles spiritualattainment is held to be naturally present because, through realization ofthe supreme nature, the nature of mind manifests in and of itself as themandala of wisdom bodies and wisdom. As it is said in the Questions andAnswers of Vajrasattva(rdo rje sems dpa’i zhus lan):In reply to the question, “What is the distinction between theyogins of the outer and inner Mantrayana in regard to receivingspiritual attainment?,” [Vajrasattva said]:326Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 326"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"For example, just as a king has commanded his minister, Outer tantra’s method is to bestow spiritual attainment fromabove.As a king holds dominion once the kingdom is offered by hissubjects,Self-originating Great Perfection is the unsurpassable way.And as it is said in the Secret Essence:This wondrous, magical, amazing phenomena...And so on.Distinction: EmpowermentsAs for the third distinction, that of empowerments: The outer tantric vehi-cles are unable to obtain the three higher sublime empowerments, and theinner tantric vehicles are principally invested with these three.Distinction: ConductAs for the fourth distinction, that of conduct: The inner tantric vehiclescan perform conduct in which the twenty samsaric phenomena areembraced through skillful means, and the outer tantric vehicles cannot. Distinction: ResultAs for the fifth distinction, their result: The outer tantric vehicles can unitea practitioner with the result (full enlightenment) in three, five, or sevenlifetimes and so forth, and the inner tantric vehicles can unite a practitionerin this life.A Concise Review of the Three Higher VehiclesNext, Dudjom Rinpoché gives a concise review of each of the six tantricvehicles: The three lower vehicles:1.

Mahayoga tantras (rgyud ma ha yo ga)2. Anuyoga transmissions (lung a nu yo ga)3. Atiyoga pith instructions (man ngag a ti yo ga) Distinction of the Three Inner Tantric Vehicles Based upon ViewConcerning the distinctions between these three, Dudjom Rinpoché quotesLord Zurchungpa’s (rje zur chung pa) reply to a question raised by LenchabBarwa (glan chab bar ba):Mahayoga manifests as the magical display (cho ’phrul) of aware-ness. Anuyoga manifests as one’s own awareness’s (rang rig)dynamic energy (rtsal). Atiyoga is the manifestation (rangsnang) of awareness in and of itself. Garab Dorjé has said:[The three inner tantric vehicles refer respectively to] mag-ical display, dynamic energy, and manifestation in and ofitself.Dudjom Rinpoché explains these three inner vehicles’ distinctive qualitiesin terms of view:Mahayoga realizes all phenomena to be the magical display ofthe nature of mind, the inseparability of appearance and empti-ness. Anuyoga realizes all phenomena as the dynamic energy ofthe nature of mind, the non-duality of stainless space and wis-dom.

It is called Great Perfection Atiyoga without creation because itis free from both creation and perfection stages.Alternatively, Mahayoga is strongly focused upon the ten fac-tors of tantra.334Anuyoga has less fixation on them, and Atiyogais free of fixation on them.And Menyak Jung-drak said:335Though the three aspects of creation and perfection are presentin each vehicle, Mahayoga emphasizes the creation stage;Anuyoga emphasizes the perfection stage; and Great Perfectionis free from both their efforts.Chal-lo Kunga Dorjé also eloquently described this as the distinctionbetween these terms’ definitions.In The Great Chariot, the supreme, omniscient Longchenpa has said:Mahayoga father tantras are the nature of skillful means ofAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles329Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 329"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"appearances helpful to disciples who are predominantly angryand have many thoughts.

It is far superior to the outer yogas because it unites(’byor) the mind to non-dual truth.ClassificationThe Mahayoga vehicle is classified according to six topics: 1. the twofold entrance: through empowerments and the actual entranceof the threefold meditative contemplation2. view3. discipline4. meditation 5. conduct 6. resultTwofold EntranceFirst, empowerment is the entrance into Mahayoga. In relation to Maha-yoga there are four empowerments. In addition to the vase empowermentthat occurs in common with the three outer tantras, there are also the threesupreme uncommon empowerments: the secret empowerment, wisdomempowerment, and the “fourth empowerment.”Second, the actual entrance is through the threefold meditative contem-plation:1. the yoga of great emptiness: incisive knowledge2. the magical display of compassion: skillful means3. the subtle and coarse symbolsDudjom Rinpoché supports this by citing the Tantra of Self-ManifestAwareness(rig pa rang shar gyi rgyud):The entrance is the threefold meditative contemplation.An Explanation of the Nine Vehicles331Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 331"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"ViewSecond, the view of Mahayoga. Dudjom Rinpoché explains the view asfollows:Ultimate truth is held to be awareness manifesting without elab-oration, spontaneously accomplished as the essential cause. Rel-ative truth is held to be that all thoughts that are the display(rtsal) of that awareness manifest in and of themselves as a man-dala of wisdom bodies and wisdom. Neither ultimate nor relativetruth is biased toward emptiness or phenomena because theiressence manifests as an indivisible evenness. When we use theconventional expression “indivisible,” this refers to an indivisibil-ity that is free from being within the field of one’s experience,since it transcends being an object of thought or expression thatperceives it. Accordingly, it is said in the Array of the Path(rnambkod):The truth of the superior indivisibility of evenness,While it is indeed shown everywhere by terms,Actually transcends being an object of thought or speech.It is said in Stages of the Path:To be freed from clinging to these terms,Thought and expression are transcended within both conven-tional designations.DisciplineThird, the discipline of Mahayoga. Dudjom Rinpoché states that accordingto the Nyingma tradition:It is said that there are twenty-eight tantric commitments (sa -maya) of Mahayoga.

In the mother tantras, such as those of Cakrasamvara (bdemchog), Hévajra (dgyes rdo rje), and Yangdak, the elaborations ofthe creation stage are fewer, and it is held that there is practice ina way that is non-conceptual regarding emptiness and exaltationand in which the perfection stage of wisdom emphasizes the bod-hicitta essence.In the non-dual tantras, such as the Magical Net(sgyu ’phruldrwa ba), the stages of creation and perfection are in integralunion (zung du ’jug), and it is said that there is practice thatemphasizes exaltation, luminosity, non-conceptual wisdom thatarises from the channels, vital energy, and tikléof the perfectionstage, and especially the supreme wisdom of luminosity.In this context, if we explain meditation from the point of viewof the Secret Essence Root Tantra, then as it is said in the ThreeStages:It is said that there are two specific kinds of meditation:The stages of meditation with characteristics andUltimate reality as it is [that is, meditation without character -istics].Therefore, there is meditation both with and without character-istics. First, meditation with characteristics includes both the creationand perfection stages. As for the creation stage, it refers to thepractice in which the wisdom deity and concepts are meditatedupon as inseparable by emphasizing the successive creation ofthe mandala based upon the three meditative absorptions. Thereare two aspects to the creation stage: devotional meditation (mosbsgom) and certain perfection (nges rdzogs). First, devotional meditation is practicing even though one hasnot attained stability in meditative absorption.

Therefore, it is saidin the Three Stages:There are instructions for the upper and lower gates.The second, meditation without characteristics, refers to med-itation on the meditative absorption of the nature of phenomenaas it is (de bzhin nyid). ConductFifth, the conduct of Mahayoga. Dudjom Rinpoché describes the conductthat a Mahayoga practitioner engages in as follows:Any phenomena of samsara can be practiced without attachmentsince it is accepted with confidence in skillful means.

Definition of TermsSecond, Dudjom Rinpoché defines the term anuyoga:The [Sanskrit] anuyogais called jé su naljor(rjes su rnal ’byor)[in Tibetan], “subsequent yoga” [in English], since it emphasizesthe path of desire involved (rjes) with incisive knowledge.ClassificationThird is the classification of Anuyoga. Dudjom Rinpoché describes six cat-egories: 336Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 336"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"1. twofold entrance2. view3. discipline4. meditation5. conduct6. resultTwofold entranceThe first category in the classification of Anuyoga, is the twofold entrance:1. empowerment 2. actual entranceAs for empowerment, there are a variety of classification systems. Dud-jom Rinpoché explains there are thirty-six empowerment rituals subsumedwithin the four categories of outer, inner, attainment, and secret empower-ments. Dudjom Rinpoché cites a passage from the Analysis of Empower-ment’s Meaning(dbang don rnam par ’byed pa):Ten empowerments bring about possession of the enlightenedfamily.Eleven empowerments bring about the inner secret.Thirteen empowerments are known as “the great Lama.”Two empowerments perfect the empowerment of the nine vehicles. The second aspect of the twofold entrance to Anuyoga is the actualentrance, through which one enters by means of the non-duality of stain-less space and wisdom.ViewThe second category in the classification of Anuyoga is the view. DudjomRinpoché explains the view as follows:All phenomena are one’s own mind, and that itself is the purevast expanse of the space of the female consort Kuntu Zangmo,whose nature is unborn and free of elaborations. It is also calledthe “primordial mandala just as it is.” In this respect, it is alsoAn Explanation of the Nine Vehicles337Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 337"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"said in the General Discourse That Gathers All Intentions:Since that which has arisen from mind is emptiness,Everything that has arisen from it is empty.Awareness, itself unborn though unceasing in every respect, radi-ates as a mandala of self-manifest light and is called “WisdomBuddha Kuntu Zangpo” or the “Natural Spontaneously Accom-plished Mandala.” In the same text it is said:Unseen upon examination,It manifests everything.The inseparable illumination of these two mandalas is the greatexaltation child of the non-duality of stainless space and wisdom,the root mandala of enlightened mind. In accord with this, it isagain said in the Sutra That Gathers All Intentions:That which is called “secret mantra” is ultimate reality as itis, in which appearance and non-appearance are non-dual. Itis liberated from the essence of duality and does not haveany fixation whatsoever on a middle between two things.For this reason all phenomena are seen as primordially Buddha inthe root mandala of enlightened mind, whose nature is insepara-ble from the three mandalas.336DisciplineThe third category in the classification of Anuyoga is discipline. There areroot and branch tantric commitments that must be kept. From among thevarious classification systems Dudjom Rinpoché explains these tantric com-mitments based upon the sixty-sixth chapter of the Sutra Synthesizing theWisdom Mind of All Buddhas(sangs rgyas thams cad kyi dgongs pa ’duspa’i mdo). Based upon this text, there are nine enumerations, namely: 1. four tantric commitments definitive to the important scriptures2. twenty-eight common tantric commitments3. four superior tantric commitments338Appendix 1Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 338"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"4. twenty-three relating to discipline5. twenty relating to attainment6. four relating to continuity of behavior7. five negative forms of energy to be abandoned8. four enemies to be destroyed9. tantric commitment of the viewMeditationThe fourth category in the classification of Anuyoga is meditation. Adetailed explanation of the meditation associated with Anuyoga falls out-side the scope of this introduction, but generally, Dudjom Rinpochéexplains that Anuyoga meditation comprises both the path of skillful meansand the path of liberation. The path of skillful means involves the yoga ofmeditation that works with the four or six cakras. The path of liberationcomprises non-conceptual meditation, meditation utilizing elaborationssuch as mantra recitation, and meditation in which the universe and allbeings contained within distinctly radiate as the mandala of deities in aninstantaneous manner, like a fish leaping from water.ConductThe fifth category in the classification of Anuyoga is conduct. Dudjom Rin-poché explains conduct as follows:Generally, conduct emphasizes evenness. As it is said in the Mag-ical Key to the Storehouse:The perfection stage AnuyogaIs the perfect rapture of the inseparability of stainless space andwisdom.When classified in detail, there are three types of conduct: be -stowal of blessings, overwhelming, and skillful means.

The sec-ond entrance, the actual entrance, is entering by means of not enteringanything at all. Dudjom Rinpoché supports this by citing All-CreatingKing:Regarding the Buddha’s teachings there is nothing to be done,Thus it is entered effortlessly.ViewThe second category in the classification of Atiyoga is the view. As DudjomRinpoché explains:All phenomena, everything that seemingly exists (snang srid)subsumed within samsara and enlightenment, are held to beeffortlessly and primordially enlightened in the essence of self-manifest wisdom, dharmakaya, the supreme tiklé. As it is said inthe Vast Space of Vajrasattva(rdo rje sems dpa’i nam mkha’ che):Having been effortlessly liberated through self-originating wisdom,The path of liberation is shown.And it is said in The Great Garuda(khyung chen):Self-manifest wisdom always abides as it is, without concepts.DisciplineThe third category in the classification of Atiyoga is discipline.

DudjomRinpoché begins by citing the Supreme Array of Ati(a ti bkod pa chen po):For those who hold to mind, there is the Mind Class;For those who hold to space, there is the Vast Expanse Class;And for those who are free of gradual effort, there is the PithInstruction Class.Dudjom Rinpoché comments on the above quotation:In accord with this quotation, the Mind Class refers to restingwithin the nature of empty awareness, dharmakaya. The VastExpanse Class refers to resting within the nature of phenomena,without activity or effort. And the Pith Instruction Class refers toresting within the nature of phenomena, primordially liberated,free from conduct that accepts or rejects.Generally, meditation in the tradition of the Great Perfectionis subsumed within Cutting through Solidity (khregs chod) andDirect Vision (thod rgal).

PowerThere are several ways of classifying the Buddha’s Word according to vehi-cles based on their power. The word “vehicle” in English, theg pain Tibetan,and yanain Sanskrit is used quite often in Buddhist texts, such as in Sutra -350Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 350"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"yana, Mahayana, Vajrayana, and so forth, so it might be worth quotingDudjom Rinpoché’s explanation of why this term is used:Generally, the [Tibetan word] theg pa[vehicle] was derived fromthe [Sanskrit] word yanasince one travels to higher and higherpaths, just as one gets into a means of transport; thus, it is calleda “vehicle” (theg pa).The vehicles are classified in many ways. Sometimes the Buddha’s Wordis classified as two vehicles: the Lesser Vehicle (theg pa chung ngu) and theGreater Vehicle (theg pa chen po). Sometimes it is classified as three causalvehicles: the vehicles of the hearers (thos), solitary sages (rang), and bodhi-sattvas (byang sems). There is also a fourfold classification that includes thethree causal vehicles and the resultant vehicle (Vajrayana). Dudjom Rin-poché quotes from the Magical Net of Manjushri:One renounces through the three vehiclesAnd abides in the result through the single vehicle [the Vajrayana].The vehicles can also be classified as fivefold by adding the vehicle ofthe higher realms of samsara (the god and human realms), which leads oneto the other four vehicles mentioned above. Dudjom Rinpoché supportsthis by citing the Secret Essence Tantra(gsang ba’i snying po):344The vehicle of gods and humans, of hearers, of solitary sages, ofbodhisattvas, and the Unsurpassable Vehicle [make five].The vehicles can also be classified as nine. Dudjom Rinpoché quotes fromAll-Creating King(kun byed rgyal po):While there exists but one,It appears as nine vehicles.Dudjom Rinpoché emphasizes that the different vehicles are not separatepaths, but instead, they are similar to rungs of a ladder that leads to enlight-enment.

The classification intonumerous vehicles has been made provisionally; their circum-stances and the greater and lesser degree of their importance weretaught as skillful means for the training of disciples. It is intendedthat when these vehicles have each arrived at the result of theirrespective paths, they are continued still higher in the supremeteaching of the Vajrayana, the sole path on which all Buddhashave progressed. Those others [hearers, solitary sages, and bodhi-sattvas] are taught merely as paths leading to this vehicle. Theyare paths that are to be traversed until perfect enlightenment andare positioned like rungs of a ladder.

The three lower classes oftantras:✦Kriyatantra✦Caryatantra (also referred to as Upatantra)✦Yogatantraand the three higher classes of tantras, the creation and perfection stagesbelonging to Highest Yogatantra:✦Mahayoga✦Anuyoga✦AtiyogaDudjom Rinpoché then explains:352Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 352"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"In general, it is appropriate either to apply the name “single vehi-cle” to all the Buddhist teachings subsumed under the level ofenlightenment, or apply the names of the individual vehicles toeach in particular, because they are the path to be journeyedtoward omniscience.These nine vehicles are: the hearers, solitary Buddhas, bodhi-sattvas, Kriyatantra, Caryatantra, Yogatantra, Mahayoga,Anuyoga, and Atiyoga.Dudjom Rinpoché also mentions that from the ultimate perspective—anindividual abiding in the natural state—it is said there is no vehicle what-soever, and he substantiates this with a quotation from the Sutra of theDescent to Lanka(lang gshegs):When the mind becomes transformed,There is neither vehicle nor passenger.ConclusionIn conclusion, Dudjom Rinpoché reaffirms that within the Nyingma tra-dition all Buddha’s teachings are explained in terms of nine vehicles, oralternatively as nine stages of a single vehicle:As it is said in the Tantra of the Great Self-Manifestation ofAwareness(rig pa rang shar):The sublime Buddhist teachings are:The discourses, extensive teachings,and very extensive teachings.The very extensive teachings arethe inconceivable eighty-four thousand categories of teachings,an extremely vast number,inconceivable, immeasurable,ineffable, and far beyond all thought.Extensive teachings such as theseare considered to have nine classifications:Those of hearers, solitary sages, and likewise the bodhisattvas;The vehicles of Kriya, Upa, and likewise Yoga are explained.Transmission of the Literary Expression of Buddha’s Teachings353Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 353"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"There are also the Maha, Anuyoga, and likewise Great PerfectionAti.In this way, it is explained in nine aspects.These nine vehicles will not be discussed as this point. I refer the readerto Appendix 1 for a detailed explanation of the nine vehicles.Treatises (bstan bcos)The treatises comment upon the intention of Buddha’s Word and areexplained through three categories:1. characteristics of the treatises2. meaning of the words3. classification of the treatisesCharacteristics of the TreatisesDudjom Rinpoché explains the characteristics of the treatises:A simple treatise (bstan bcos tsam) is characterized as a scrip-tural teaching (lung gi chos) that is arranged in such a way as topresent one’s own philosophical approach (grub mtha’) to others.Any treatise that possesses four unique qualities is characterizedas a pure treatise, while those lacking any of the four uniquequalities are categorized as nominal treatises (bstan bcos ltarsnang).Dudjom Rinpoché explains these four unique qualities as follows: 1. First is the unique quality of motivation. This pertains to awriter whose mind is undistracted, whose words and meaningare based in incisive knowledge, and who writes out of compas-sion to help others. 2. Second is the unique quality of expressive words that can beproperly written in metrical verses (sdeb sbyor). 3. Third is the unique quality of the subject matter (brjod byadon), which indicates the methods for those disciples whorequire training and aspire to liberation.4. Fourth is the unique quality of purposeful composition, which354Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 354"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"has the power to lead one to the attainment of liberationthrough study and the consideration of these words. Meaning of the Words Dudjom Rinpoché explains that the Tibetan word tan chö (bstan bcos, “trea-tise” in English) is derived from the Sanskrit word shastra, which is madeup of shabana, “to change,” and traya, “to protect.” He then elaborates:It is called shabana [in Sanskrit], “to change,” since in its causalaspect it changes the three poisons of the passions into the threehigher trainings;345and it is called traya[in Sanskrit], “to pro-tect”, since in its resultant aspect it protects from the sufferingsof samsara and from rebirth in the lower realms. Therefore, sinceit has the qualities of change (’chos) and protection (skyob), it isa treatise (bstan bcos). As it is said in the Rational System ofDetailed Explanation(rnam bshad rigs pa):It changes (’chos) all enemies that are the passionsAnd protects (skyob) from rebirth in the lower realms.Since it has the qualities of change and protection, it is called atreatise (bstan bcos).Treatises having both these qualities do not exist in other traditions.Classification of the TreatisesTreatises are classified in six ways: 1. level of composition2. purpose of their composition3. individual authors4. manner of composition 5. explaining according to the Buddha’s Word 6. the meaning they express1. Treatises Classified According to the Level of CompositionTreatises classified according to the level of their composition are of fourkinds: meaningless, ordinary meaning, reverse meaning, and meaningful.Dudjom Rinpoché mentions a Sanskrit text describing dentistry for crows,Transmission of the Literary Expression of Buddha’s Teachings355Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 355"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"the Kakadantaparik-shastra, as an example of a meaningless text. Texts inthe category of having mere ordinary meaning are treatises on the fourcommon sciences (rig gnas bzhi). Those of reverse meaning are the treatisesof non-Buddhists who hold extreme views of nihilism or eternalism. Thetreatises that fall into the category of meaningful treatises are those on theinner science of Buddhism (sangs rgyas pa’i nang rig).Dudjom Rinpoché explains that according to the Yogacara Bhumi thereare nine types of treatises taught in three sets. The first set includes trea-tises that are: meaningless, of reverse meaning, and meaningful. The sec-ond set includes those that are: deceptive, lacking compassion, and thatabandon suffering. The third set includes treatises devoted to debate,polemics, and attainment.Dudjom Rinpoché points out that the first two types of treatises of eachset are nominal treatises of a lower level, while the last one of each set is agenuine treatise of a sublime level.2. Treatises Classified According to the Purpose of CompositionThere are three types of treatises when classified according to the purposeof their composition. First, there are those that summarize the vast mean-ing of the Buddha’s Word, such as the Abhidharma-samuccaya (mngonpa kun las btus pa). Second, there are those that are compilations (’khrugspa go rim), such as the Root Discourse of the Vinaya (’dul ba mdo rtsa ba).And third, there are those treatises that reveal the profound meaning, suchas the Mahayanottara-tantra Shastra (theg chen rgyud bla ma’i bstanbcos).3. Treatises Classified According to Individual AuthorsDudjom Rinpoché explains that there are five types of treatises when clas-sified according to their individual authors (rtsom byed gang zag):First, treatises composed based upon the teachings given by perfect Bud-dhas, such as the Five Transmissions of the Assembly of Joyous Buddhas(bde ’dus kyi lung lnga), composed by Vajradharma; and the Five Doctrinesof Maitreya (byams chos sde lnga).Second, treatises written based upon the teachings given by arhats, suchas the Seven Sections on the Abhidharma (mngon pa sde bdun).356Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 356"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Third, treatises written based upon the teachings given by sublimebodhisattvas, such as the extensive treatises of the Five Sections on theLevels (sa sde lnga); concise treatises known as the Compendium of Abhid-harma(mngon pa kun las btus pa); and the Collection of the Greater Vehi-cle (theg pa chen po bsdus pa). These were all composed by Arya Asanga,a bodhisattva abiding on the third level (bhumi).Fourth, treatises written after prophecies (lung bstan) had been obtainedfrom wisdom deities, such as the Compendium of Valid Cognition (Pra-manasamuccaya; tshad ma kun las btus pa) by Dignaga; and the SevenTreasuries of Scriptures (gsung rab mdzod bdun) by Kunkhyen LongchenRabjampa.Fifth, treatises written by ordinary learned panditas to present their ownphilosophical approach and to refute the reverse views of others. One suchtext mentioned by Dudjom Rinpoché is the Eight Dissertations (Ash-taprakarana; sde brgyad) composed by the pre-eminent scholar Vasu -bandhu.4. Treatises Classified According to the Manner of Their CompositionAccording to Dudjom Rinpoché, there are two categories of treatises whenclassified according to the manner of their composition: ✦treatises designated as commentaries on the Buddha’s Word ✦treatises that are written independently based upon the meaning ofthe Buddha’s WordFirst, Treatises Designated as Commentaries on the Buddha’s WordThese are of four types:First, extensive commentaries that establish in detail both the word andmeaning of the Buddha’s Word, such as the Commentary on the Prak-timoksha Sutra in Fifty Sections (Pratimoksha-sutratika; so thar gyi mdo’i’grel pa bam po lnga bcu pa), and the Great Commentary on the Kala-cakra Tantra Entitled Stainless Light (Vimalaprabha;dus ’khor ’grel chendri ma med pa’i ’od).Second, word-for-word commentaries (tshig ’grel) that elaboratelyexplain the words in conjunction with annotations, such as the Commen-tary on the Collection of Meaningful Expressions (Udana-vargavrtti; cheddu brjod pa’i tshom kyi ’grel pa), and Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Direc-Transmission of the Literary Expression of Buddha’s Teachings357Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 357"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"tions: A Commentary on the Secret Essence (snying ’grel phyogs bcu munsel) by Kunkhyen Longchenpa.Third, commentaries that discern points that are difficult to understand,such as the Commentary on the Concise Perfection of Wisdom (Sancaya-gathapanjika; sdud pa’i ’grel pa).Fourth, commentaries that subsume and establish the main point (dongyi gtso bo) are commentaries that summarize the main points of a text(bsdus don), such as the Condensed Commentary on the Secret Essence(Guhyagarbhapindartha; snying ’grel pindartha) by Vimalamitra, and theChapterless Commentary on the Supplementary Magical Net(le lag gi sama ’grel) by the great Mahapandita Rongzompa.Second, Treatises Written Independently on the Meaning of the Buddha’s WordThese are of three types:First, those that completely teach the meaning of one text of Buddha’sWord, such as the Root Discourse of the Vinaya (Vinayamulasutra;’dul bamdo rtsa ba) composed by Gunaprabha, the Ornament of Emergent Real-ization (Abhisamayalamkara; mngon rtogs rgyan) by Maitreyanatha, andthe Sequence of the Path of the Magical Net (Mayajala-vajrakarmakrama;sgyu ’phrul lam rim) written by Buddhaguhya.Second, those that teach the meaning of a fragmentary text of Buddha’sWord, such as the Stanzas on the Novitiate(Shramanera-karika; dge tshulgyi ka ri ki).Third, those that teach the meaning of many texts of Buddha’s Word.These include treatises such as the Compendium of Lessons(Shiksha-samuccaya; bslab btus) composed by Shantideva, and the Precious Treas-ury of Noble Qualities(yon tan rin po che’i mdzod) composed by theomniscient Jigmé Lingpa.5. Treatises Classified According to the Buddha’s Word That They ExplainTreatises classified according to the Buddha’s Word they explain are thosetreatises that comment on the general teachings of Buddha’s Word, includ-ing commentaries on their verbal structure, such as the grammatical trea-tises of the Kalapasutraand the Grammar of Candragomin(Candra-vyakarana), and commentaries on their meaning such as the Seven Sec-tions of Valid Cognitionby Dharmakirti.358Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 358"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Treatises on the Intention of the Three Turnings of the Wheel of the Dharma and the Collection of the Awareness-holdersDudjom Rinpoché explains that there are also treatises that comment onthe intention of the three turnings of the wheel of the Dharma of Bud-dha’s Word, as well as the Collection of the Awareness-holders.First turning of the wheel of the DharmaThe first category—which is threefold—are commentaries on the intentionof the first turning of the wheel of the Dharma:1. First, commentaries that establish the view, such as the Treasure ofAbhidharma (Abhidharmakosha; chos mngon pa mdzod) byVasubandhu. 2. Second, commentaries that establish conduct, such as the Root Dis-course of the Vinaya. 3. And third, commentaries that establish the indivisibility of view andconduct, such as the Great Treasure of Detailed Exposition (Vib-hashakosha; bye brag bshad mdzod chen mo).Intermediate turning of the wheel of the DharmaThe second category—which is threefold—are commentaries on the inten-tion of the intermediate turning of the wheel of the Dharma:1. First, commentaries that establish the view, such as the Collection ofMadhyamaka Reasoning (Yuktikaya; dbu ma rigs tshogs) written byNagarjuna. 2. Second, commentaries that establish conduct, such as Entering theConduct of Bodhisattvas (Bodhisattvacaryavatara; byang chub semsdpa’i spyod pa la ’jug pa) by Shantideva. 3.

And third, commentaries that establish the indivisibility of view andconduct, such as the Ornament of the Sutras of the Greater Vehicle(Mahayana-sutralamkarakarika; theg pa chen po mdo sde rgyan) byMaitreya.Collection of the Awareness-holdersThe fourth category—which is threefold—is that of the Collection of theAwareness-holders, also referred to as the Fourth Collection. Dudjom Rin-poché explains that treatises in this collection comment on the intention ofthe four or six classes of tantra.1. First, commentaries that establish the view, such as Garland of Views:A Collection of Upadesha (Upadesha-darshanamala; man ngag ltaba’i phreng ba) by the great master Padmasambhava. 2. Second, commentaries which establish conduct, such as Clarificationof Samaya (Samayavivyakti; dam tshig gsal bkra) by Lilavajra. 3. Third, commentaries which establish the indivisibility of view andconduct, such as the Sequence of the Path of the Magical Net (Maya-jala-pathakrama; sgyu ’phrul lam rim) by Buddhaguhya.6. Treatises Classified According to the Meaning They ExpressTreatises classified according to the meaning they express are twofold: 1. treatises that teach quantitatively2. treatises that teach qualitativelyTreatises That Teach QuantitativelyFirst, those that teach quantitatively are classified in two ways: commonquantitative treatises and uncommon quantitative treatises. Common quantitative treatisesDudjom Rinpoché explains the common quantitative treatises as beingtreatises explicating worldly traditions such as guides for distinguishingprecious gems, horses, clothes, land, and so forth, such as the ancient Indian360Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 360"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"text called the Point of Human Sustenance(Nitishastrajantu-poshan-abindu). Dudjom Rinpoché explains that these treatises can lead to thehigher realms of humans and gods which can then be a stepping stone toliberation; he then supports this by citing the Hundred Verses on IncisiveKnowledge(shes rab brgya pa):346If positive human traditions are practiced well, The journey to the god realms is not far off.Climbing the stairway of men and gods,One is close to liberation.Uncommon quantitative treatisesDudjom Rinpoché next explains the uncommon quantitative treatises asbeing treatises that establish the first four of the five sciences (rig gnaslnga):1. arts2. medicine3. grammar4. logic The fifth is the inner science of the teachings of Buddha.The Science of the Arts. There are three categories regarding the science ofthe arts. Supreme among the arts of form are methods for constructingreceptacles of Buddha’s body, speech, and mind such as statues, books, andstupas. Supreme among the arts of speech are the songs of praise in theform of offerings to the Buddhas. And supreme among the arts of mind arethe extraordinary aspects of the wisdom produced through study, reflection,and meditation.The Science of Medicine. Medical science is usually explained under fourheadings: the illness and the person to be healed; the remedy that heals,including life-style, medicine, and diagnosis; the types of healing, whichinclude prolonging life free of disease and healing disease when it occurs;and the healer: the doctors, nurses, and other health practitioners and care-givers. This is explained in treatises such as the Commentary on the Inten-tion of the Four Glorious Tantras of Medical Science (dpal ldan rgyud bzhi’idgongs pa) by Yutokpa.Transmission of the Literary Expression of Buddha’s Teachings361Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 361"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"The Science of Grammar. According to Dudjom Rinpoché, an importantgrammatical treatise known in India was the Commentary of Panini(Panini vyakaranasutra); and the two famous texts known in Tibet as thesun and moon are the treatises and instructions of the Kalapasutra (sgraka la pa) and the Grammar of Candragomin (Candravyakaranasutra; sgratsandra).The Science of Logic. Logic is used as a means for comprehending thatwhich is to be appraised by oneself, and as a means of communicating thatunderstanding to others. Examples of treatises of logic given by DudjomRinpoché are the Sutra of Valid Cognition (tshad ma mdo) composed bythe master Dignaga, and commentaries on its intention such as the SevenSections of Valid Cognition (tshad ma sde bdun) composed by the gloriousDharmakirti.Five Minor SciencesIn addition, Dudjom Rinpoché mentions there are also five minor sci-ences—astrology, poetics, prosody, synonymies, and drama—which areusually categorized as branches of the artistic or grammatical sciences.Astrology. First are the treatises on the science of astrology, which alsoincludes the science of elemental divination and geomancy (’byung rtsi).Important astrological treatises are the Commentary on the KalacakraTantra (dus ’khor rgyud ’grel), the Commentary on the Four Seats (gdanbzhi ’grel pa), and a treatise held in common with non-Buddhists calledthe Astrological Treatise Entitled Martial Conquest (Yuddha-jayanama-tantra-rajasvarodaya; gyul las rnam rgyal). Explanations on geomancycan be found in such treatises as the Mother and Son of the ClarifyingLamp (gsal sgron ma bu).Poetics. Second are the treatises on poetics, such as the Mirror of Poetics(Kavyadarsha;snyan ngag me long dbyug pa can gyi gzhungs) by Dandin.Prosody. Third are the treatises on prosody such as the Precious SourceofProsody (Chando-ratnakara; sdeb sbyor rin chen ’byung gnas) by themaster Shantipa. 362Appendix 2Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 362"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Synonymies. Fourth are treatises on synonyms, homonyms, epithets, andso on, such as the Treasury of Amarasimha (Amarokosha;’chi med mdzod).Drama. Fifth are treatises on drama, such as the Dramatical Treatise(Natyashastra; bha ra ta).Treatises That Teach QualitativelyQualitative treatises teach methods for attaining liberation and omniscienceand are exemplified in the Great Vehicle (Mahayana) by those of the Mad-hyamaka school that establish the selflessness of the individual and phe-nomena. Qualitative treatises include those such as the Bodhisattva Levels(byang sa) by Asanga, and Entering the Conduct of Bodhisattvas(byangchub sems dpa’i spyod pa la ’jug pa) by Shantideva. Masters at differentlevels compose these treatises. For instance, the superior type of masterincludes those who perceive the nature of phenomena, such as the gloriouslord Nagarjuna and the sublime Asanga. The middling type of masterincludes those to whom permission to write was given by their wisdomdeities, such masters as Dignaga and Candragomin. The lesser type of mas-ter includes those who are learned in the five sciences and possess the eso-teric instructions of the lineage of Lamas, such masters as Shrigupta andShakyamati.The instructions of the lineages that these masters possess have fiveaspects regarding the explanation of the discourses:1. relating purpose 2. condensed meaning3. words along with meaning4. response to objections5. an outline that connects the textAlternatively, the explanation of the tantras can be explained throughfive calculated approaches that conform to five headings given by Buddhaas found in the Clarifying Lamp(sgron gsal)347by Candrakirti: 1.

Always Noble, Kuntu Zangpo, is the original primordial Buddha, who has never beendeluded, since the very beginning, having recognized all phenomena as being the displayof his own wisdom mind.19. In this context I have translated the Tibetan word dü(bdud), which is a translation of theSanskrit mara, as “negative forces”. In general, mara represents clinging to a self andone’s attachment and involvement with the eight worldly concerns. Often mara is dis-cussed in the context of the four maras (bdud bzhi), negative forces or demons. Accord-ing to the Sutrayana tradition, the four demons are: the demon of the aggregates; of thepassions; of death; and of the child of the gods. According to the Vajrayana tradition, thefour demons are: the material demon; the immaterial demon; the demon of exaltation; andthe demon of pride. The material demon refers to external phenomena, whether thingsor other beings who do us harm. The immaterial demon refers to the three poisons—anger, desire, and ignorance. The demon of exaltation refers to attachment to such thingsas inner spiritual experiences. The demon of pride—the root of all demons—is clingingto a self. For an excellent and detailed account of mara, see Sarah Harding’s introductionto and translation of Machik’s Complete Explanation, pp. 33–8, and pp. 117–22. Also seePatrul Rinpoché’s The Words of My Perfect Teacher, pp. 297–307.20. The eight worldly dharmas are gain and loss; praise and blame; pleasure and pain; fameand infamy.21. According to Lopön Jigmé, this passage refers to inner retreat. This is very important andcontributes to the inner and direct nature of these teachings. Outer retreat means toretreat in a solitary, isolated location, such as forests or mountains. The practitionerleaves behind his home, family, friends, and the things that he or she enjoys, whetherclassical concerts, poetry readings, the theater, or a good baseball game. He sets physi-cal boundaries that he is not allowed to transgress, and no one is permitted to enter.This is outer retreat. But what is most important is inner retreat. It is not enough tomerely go to an isolated place, because you can still be very much engaged in the worldby thinking about the outside world. The truly isolated place is to hold the thought ofdeath in one’s own heart, which is a support for diligence and perseverance in practice.It is important for the practitioner to be sick and tired of grasping on to one thing afteranother, which only perpetuates endless circling of samsara, the wheel of life. It is cru-cial that the practitioner set the inner retreat boundary, which is to give up thoughts ofthis life that are only involved with propping up the ego. To stay within physical retreatboundaries with your mind totally involved with the world you thought you left behindis to transgress the inner retreat boundary. Usually when you are in strict retreat, youdo not see anyone except your spiritual master who is guiding your retreat. From theperspective of inner retreat, it is not enough not to see anyone; you must not becomeinternally involved with the eight worldly concerns as they arise in your mind. LopönJigmé explains that someone who can make this type of inner retreat does not have togo to an isolated retreat to be in retreat but is in retreat even within the context of dailylife. This is why the current text Essential Advice for Solitary Meditation Practiceis notlimited only to those who have gone to an isolated place to practice. This text is very pro-found since His Holiness is pointing out to us how to do inner retreat and inner prac-tice, which can be applied in all contexts, whether in an isolated three-year retreat or inyour daily life as a householder.22. For a traditional explanation of these demons, see Machik’s Complete Explanation, pp.231–34. Actually, the entire book is the best resource to learn about the various demonsand spirits that appear throughout Tibetan Buddhist practice and literature.23. His Holiness writes this in the context of a culture in which spiritual practice wasrewarded to the point of being a lucrative career.24. In Buddhist countries this implies that the recipient would beg or receive support to stayin retreat.404NotesWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 404"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"25. This is a Tibetan expression that literally means “do not burn the nose of others.” Thismeans that a practitioner should not irritate, agitate, or be harsh to others.26. “To abide in non-action” does not mean to be lazy, not to practice at all, or to becomeunemployed. It means not to engage in dualistic mind that clings to whatever phenom-ena appear in relation to your body, speech, and mind regardless of the physical activityin which you are engaged.27. The common preliminary practices—the four aspects to turn the mind away from sam-sara—are to contemplate: the preciousness of human birth; impermanence and death;the inevitability of the cause and effect of karma; and the suffering within cyclic existence(samsara). By considering these four thoughts, one’s mind is subdued, one turns awayfrom preoccupation with cyclic existence, and one is inspired to practice the pure spiri-tual path, with determination and diligence, until enlightenment is attained. For in-depthteachings on this important subject, and for explanations on the uncommon preliminarypractices, I highly recommend the following texts: the soon-to-be-released commentaryon the concise version of the preliminary practices of the New Treasures of His HolinessDudjom Rinpoché, written by Kyabjé Dungsé Thinley Norbu Rinpoché, as yet untitled;The Words of My Perfect Teacherby Patrul Rinpoché; Resting in the Nature of Mind(sems nyid ngal gso) by Kunkhyen Longchenpa, translated under the title Kindly Bentto Ease Us; and Dudjom Rinpoché’s commentary on the long version of the preliminarypractices of the New Treasures of His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoché, currently untrans-lated, located in CWDR, vol. pa, pp. 25–421.28. These uncommon preliminary practices are an essential foundation for all Buddhist prac-tice, including that of the Great Perfection. 29. This means that all phenomena without exception, existence as well as anything associ-ated with the state of enlightenment, are the display of emptiness, just as the sun’s raysare the display of the sun. Therefore, since the essence is primordially pure, sublime,unobstructed emptiness, its display is also primordially pure, without any exceptions atall.30. According to Lopön Jigmé, “You should resolve all phenomena in this awareness” meansthat all phenomena—the outwardly perceived, substantial, inanimate phenomena, and theinner perceiving, insubstantial, animate subject—are resolved within awareness, the viewof the Great Perfection as previously stated above.31. A small child has no grasping to concepts regarding what is seen.32.bzhugs tshul, translated here as “abiding state,” is the honorific for the more commonlyused gnas tshul.33. There are many ways mindfulness is discussed and categorized, but in brief, my teacherexplains mindfulness as being of two kinds: intentional mindfulness (’du byed gyi dranpa), and mindfulness of the nature of phenomena (chos nyid kyi dran pa). Intentionalmindfulness is mindfulness based upon any effort whatsoever. Mindfulness of the natureof phenomena is effortless and uncontrived and is synonymous with abiding in the view,in awareness itself. Here, Garab Dorjé is referring to the mindfulness of the nature of phe-nomena, because he says “This is dharmakaya, not fabricated nor created by anyone.”34. In Sanskrit, klesha.The passions are ignorance (ma rig pa), desire (’dod chags), anger(khong khro ba), pride (nga rgyal), and jealousy (phra dog).35. In Tibetan, the words for subject and object are zung-wa dzin-pa(gzung ba ’dzin pa).Zung-wa refers to that which is grasped, the object, and dzin-parefers to that whichgrasps, the subject. They also have the connotations of that which is perceived and thatwhich perceives, respectively.36.

When meditating, the experiences of bliss, clarity, and emptiness automatically arise. Ifyou cling to them, then you will become sidetracked from your goal of complete libera-tion. Clinging to bliss in meditation leads to rebirth in the desire realms; clinging to clar-ity leads to rebirth in the form god realms; and clinging to emptiness leads to rebirth inthe formless god realms. All these realms are still within the endless wheel of life and,therefore, only lead to suffering.39. There is a distinction made between the great meditator (sgom chen) and the practitionerof the Great Perfection. The great meditator, through practice, develops powerful concen-tration that leads to temporary states of peace in the highest god realms, where they mayabide for many eons. Unfortunately, this is still within the context of the six realms ofcyclic existence. As a result, when the karma that allows them to remain in this state ofbliss, clarity, or non-conceptuality is exhausted, their circumstances change, and they willonce again fall into lower states of existence, including that of the hell realms. This isbecause they know how to meditate, but not how to liberate. As Patrul Rinpoché writesin The Special Commentary of the Wise Glorious King(mkhas pa shri rgyal po’i khyadchos), a commentary to Garab Dorjé’s Three Lines That Strike the Vital Point(tshig gsumgnad ’degs), “Therefore, it is said, ‘Being able to meditate but not liberate—isn’t that justlike the meditation gods?’ Those who place their trust in a meditation that is the meremeditation of mental resting that does not possess the key point of how to liberate willgo astray into the meditative states of the upper realms.” The authentic Great Perfectionpractitioner is not involved with this type of meditation based on a reference point, butwith liberation. In the same text, Patrul Rinpoché teaches “For a practitioner (rnal ’byorpa), thoughts are liberated the moment they arise.” pp. 29–30.40. The Tibetan saying literally means “as one whose head is wreathed with salt.” This meansto be completely defeated, or completely lost.41. Why is meeting someone you are familiar with like recognition’s liberation of thoughts?Because you do not mistake your friend for someone else. You are not mistaken in rec-ognizing your friend; you know immediately who this person is without thinking, guess-ing, or trying to figure it out. In the same way, thoughts are recognized as the display ofawareness and so are simultaneously liberated.42. The Tibetan word naljorpa(rnal ’byor pa) is the Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit yogi.Naljorpais made up of two words naland jor, and the particle pa. Nalrefers to what isgenuine and authentic. Jorrefers to union. So naljormeans in union with that which isgenuine, and pais a particle in Tibetan that means “the one who.” So all together naljorpameans “one who is in union with that which is genuine.”43. The word kyil (’khyil) literally means to fill a container or space evenly. According toLopön Jigmé, mind and body dissolve into basic space. They dissolve and fill space evenly,just as water, when poured into a vase, fills it equally, from top to bottom, side to side. Thisis the sense in which kyilmeans “attaining” the youthful vase body.44. It is extremely important to pay attention to your post-meditation conduct. The best wayto accomplish this is to keep your vows and tantric commitments responsibly. The vowsand tantric commitments we take protect us from accumulating negative karma and helpus to accumulate positive karma, which refines all karma making us sensitive enough tocatch the disease of full realization from our Lama. There are numerous categories of tantric commitments for Secret Mantrayana. AsDudjom Rinpoché explains in Ascertaining the Three Vows(sdom gsum rnam nges), hiscommentary to Ngari Panchen’s renowned text on the three vows:According to the Mayajala(sgyu ’phrul), there are fifteen root and branch samayas,from which three hundred and sixty are derived. According to the Akhyata-tantrathere406NotesWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 406"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"are ninety-seven samayas. In the Samanaya-sutrathere are four basic tantric commit-ments, twenty-eight common tantric commitments, four additional tantric commitments,twenty-three of fearless conduct, twenty to accomplish, four corresponding to behavior,the abandonment of the five maras, the destruction of the four enemies, and further elab-orations of the samaya that correspond to the view. In addition, each tantra elaborates onindividual root and branch tantric commitments to be guarded.Further, there are tantric commitments corresponding to samadhi, behavior, the par-taking of food, objects from which never to be separated, and many other countless enu-merations. (CWDR, vol. nga, p. 355.2)In Essential Advice, Dudjom Rinpoché states, “Secret mantra’s tantric commitmentshave many categories, but in a concise form they can be subsumed into one—tantriccommitments of the wisdom body, speech, and mind of your root spiritual master.” Dud-jom Rinpoché explains this in the commentary quoted from just above:The root tantric commitments correspond to the root Lama’s wisdom body, speech, andmind. For wisdom body, speech, and mind there are outer, inner, and secret tantric com-mitments respectively, bringing the total to twenty-seven.In actuality, the essence of these root tantric commitments is to realize the indivisi-bility of one’s three doors with the condensed essence of all the buddhas. This is likenedto realizing the root Lama’s wisdom body, speech, and mind to be non-dual as the threevajras. The very word “guru” implies weight, which can be interpreted here as the weightof the tantric commitments corresponding to the guru and how, if they are allowed todeteriorate, they will be difficult to restore. The Tibetan equivalent of the word “Guru”is Lama, which means “unsurpassed.”Of the nine tantric commitments that correspond to the body, the first three are outer:to abandon stealing, sexual misconduct, and killing. The three inner tantric commitmentsare to abandon abusing one’s family, as explained earlier, including one’s own body; abus-ing the teachings and people related to the teachings; and forcing oneself to undergounnecessary hardship, such as extreme ascetic discipline. The three secret tantric commit-ments are: to abandon striking, or even attempting to strike, the body of vajra brothersor sisters (this includes verbal abuse or criticism of ornaments or adornments they maybe wearing); making sexual advances toward the Lama’s consort; and walking on or overthe Lama’s shadow or acting unconscientiously with body and speech in the presence ofthe Lama.The nine tantric commitments that correspond to speech begin with the three outer:to abandon lying, slander, and using harsh words. The three inner tantric commitmentsare: to abandon verbally disrespecting a Buddhist teacher, disrespecting anyone who con-templates the meaning, or disrespecting anyone who meditates upon the abiding nature(gnas lugs). The three secret tantric commitments are: to abandon disrespecting thespeech of vajra brothers and sisters; speaking negative words about the conduct of thespiritual teacher; and disregarding any of the spiritual master’s teachings or advice aswell as the words of those in his immediate retinue.There are nine tantric commitments that correspond to mind. The three outer are toabandon (1) harmful thoughts, (2) coveting, and (3) the reverse point of view. The threeinner are: to abandon (1) wrong conduct, (2) carelessness (bag med), and (3) senselesschatter (tho co). The three secret are: (1) to abandon incorrect meditation practice—i.e.,practice distorted by dullness (bying), agitation (rgod), mental wandering (gol), andobscurations (sgrib) as well as to abandon the reverse points of view (log lta); (2) grasp-ing the extreme of eternalism (rtag); and (3) grasping the extreme of nihilism (chad). Inaddition, the secret tantric commitments include the abandonment of not paying atten-tion (yid la ma byed pa) to view, meditation, and conduct throughout the three times ofthe day and night, as well as not paying attention to one’s yidam deity, not paying atten-tion to guru yoga, and not paying attention to being loving and affectionate toward one’svajra brothers and sisters.Notes407Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 407"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"These are the twenty-seven root samayas corresponding to the wisdom body, speech,and mind on the outer, inner, and secret levels. (CWDR, vol. nga, p. 346.)This explanation by Dudjom Rinpoché clearly shows us the vital importance of ourrelationship to our Lama.45. According to Buddhist cosmology, there are six realms of beings that constitute samsara:the hell realm, the starving spirit realm, the animal realm, the human realm, the realmof the jealous gods, and the god realm. A human being falls into the category of thehuman realm, one of six categories of sentient beings trapped in samsara, the wheel of life.From the Vajrayana point of view, in order to receive blessings that lead to full liberation,you must see your Lama as a fully enlightened buddha, who is entirely free from cyclicexistence. Otherwise, it is said that if you see your Lama as a bodhisattva, you will receivethe blessings of a bodhisattva, and if you see your Lama as an ordinary human being, youwill merely receive the blessings of an ordinary person. 46. In other words, take everything I offer, body, speech, and mind. This means I am offer-ing to help implement my spiritual master’s activities for the benefit of others.47. That is, carefully. In Tibet, medicine was prepared by grinding various natural ingredients.48. Literally, “it doesn’t make sense to throw ashes on your own head.”49. This refers to the practice of having others, such as Lamas, practitioners, or monastics,pray and perform special practices for you, such as phowa. Also, friends and relativesusually make offerings on the deceased’s behalf, such as lighting butter lamps in templesand so forth.50. This refers to the three types of vows related to the Vajrayana, Mahayana, and Hinayanarespectively. See Perfect Conduct.51. The promise a retreatant makes to stay in retreat until its conclusion. According to theinstruction manual for the Mahayoga practice of the Vajrakilaya cycle called The RazorThat Destroys at a Touch, the three ways of doing retreat are for a specific time period,for example, six months; until a pre-determined number of mantra recitations are com-pleted, such as six million; or until realization is attained. See The Fulfiller of SpiritualAttainments: An Instruction Manual for the Razor That Destroys at a Touch. CWDR,vol. ba, pp. 533–63.52. As just mentioned above, the refusal to practice and so forth.53.

This refers to the preliminary practices: taking refuge and generating bodhicitta;Vajrasattva; and mandala offerings. See The Words of My Perfect Teacher, pp. 171–295,for an in-depth discussion.56. “The purification of ordinary phenomena into the wheel of purity” means to see allforms as the form of the wisdom deity, all sounds as the speech of the wisdom deity, andwhatever arises within one’s mind as the pure mind of the wisdom deity.57.tshogs kyi bdag po.58. “Tröma” refers to Tröma Nakmo, the Black Wrathful Goddess who is a fully enlightenedbuddha. The practices of the Mahayoga level are grouped under three categories: Lama,Wisdom Deity, and Dakini. The dakini category consists of outer, inner, secret, and inner-most secret practices. Tröma Nakmo is the innermost secret dakini practice. These prac-tices were revealed by Dudjom Lingpa and are an integral part of the Dudjom lineage.408NotesWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 408"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"59. This is His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoché’s mind treasure from the Dorjé Drolö cycle. TulkuOrgyen Chemchok Düpa Tsal, who requested this prayer, is the lineage holder of theDrolö cycle and lives in eastern Tibet. He is one of the main teachers of Dudjom Rin-poché’s current incarnation.60. This indicates that Tulku Orgyen—who requested this instruction from His Holiness—is the designated heir to this specific teaching, the Innermost Secret Gathering.61. This is the famous nuns’ institution headed by the series of incarnations of ShuksebDakini, the last of which was also a teacher of Chadral Rinpoché.62. For a discussion of remaining in non-action regarding the nine types of activities, seeBuddhahood Without Meditation, commonly known as the Nang jang, pp. 157–63.63. For example, in a Mahayoga sadhana practice, the preliminary practice can consist of lin-eage prayers, taking refuge, bodhicitta, and the seven-branch prayer. The main practice canconsist of visualization of the deity, invocation, request to remain, offerings, praise, andmantra recitation. The conclusion includes dissolution of the mandala and closing prayers,such as aspiration prayers to be reborn in the Copper-Colored Mountain, and long lifeprayers for your spiritual masters.64. In this case, “present ordinary mind” (tha mal gyi shes pa) refers to pure awareness.65. Although it is important to understand the view of the Great Perfection, it is also impor-tant to practice only under the supervision of a qualified master. It is of utmost impor-tance not to use these teachings as a basis for practicing the Great Perfection on one’s ownas it can lead to detrimental results, such as creating internal obstacles that will naturallyprevent one from practicing the correct Great Perfection path in the present and willslowly create obstacles preventing a connection with an authentic master and unbrokenlineage in the future. So please be careful. These profound teachings by Dudjom Rinpochéon the view can be used as support for whatever practice one is doing because it is veryhelpful to bring the profound view into your preliminary practices of taking refuge, gen-erating bodhicitta, purification through the practice of Vajrasattva, offering the mandalaof the entire universe to all wisdom beings, and guru yoga. It is also extremely importantto bring this profound view into your creation stage Mahayoga practice on wisdomdeities. It is not appropriate to skip these practices and create one’s own “Great Perfection”practice based upon the profound instruction of wisdom masters such as Dudjom Rin-poché. Please avoid this dangerous obstacle and practice according to your teacher’sinstructions, develop faith in the Great Perfection through reading these teachings, andif you do not have a teacher, my sincere advice is to search impeccably for a qualifiedmaster and an unbroken lineage. When these are found, develop faith and devotiontoward this wisdom teacher, and then put effort into your practice.66. The Lotus-Born (pad ma ’byung) refers to Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rin-poché (“precious guru”).67. The three excellences are preparation, main practice, and conclusion. The preparation isto generate bodhicitta (sbyor ba sems bskyed); the main practice is to practice without ref-erence points (dngos gzhi dmigs med); and the conclusion is to dedicate the merit (rjesbsngo ba).68. The six-syllable mantra, Om mani pémé hung, is the mantra of the Lord of Compassion,Chenrezi.69. The six collections (tshogs drug) refer to the six gatherings, or aggregates, of conscious-ness (rnam shes tshogs drug): eye consciousness (mig gi rnam shes); ear consciousness(rna ba’i rnam shes); nose consciousness (sna’i rnam shes); tongue consciousness (lce’irnam shes); body consciousness (lus kyi rnam shes); and mind consciousness (yid kyirnam shes).Notes409Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 409"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"70.

This text contains the very essence of all Buddhist practice; under the supervision of aqualified Lama, through this text alone, a qualified disciple can attain enlightenment inthis very life. His Holiness’s Great Perfection teachings as found in this book are inspir-ing. For one seriously interested in practicing these teachings it is essential to seek out aqualified spiritual master and diligently practice under his or her supervision.

Lake Born Vajra is the name given to Guru Rinpoché by King Indrabhuti of Oddiyana.The king was childless and without an heir to his throne. One day Krishnadhara, theking’s minister, was returning from the land of jewels when he saw a child, Guru Rin-poché, upon a lotus in the middle of Lake Danakosha in this land of Oddiyana. The kingadopted this child and gave him the name Lake Born Vajra (Tsokyé Dorjé) and also Lotus-Born (Péma Jungné). CWDR, vol. ka, p. 93.84.

The following tantric gathering song was written by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoché inhis previous incarnation as Dudjom Lingpa. This song is located in Dudjom Lingpa’sTröma volume, pp. 919–20. This song is structured around the five certainties (nges palnga), or perfections, of the sambhogakaya, body of perfect rapture. In general, the per-fect place is the Supreme Highest Pure Land (Akanishta; ’og min chen po). The perfectteachers are the five buddhas with their consorts. The perfect retinue are the fulfilledbodhisattvas. The perfect teachings are the highest Vajrayana teachings. The perfect timeis the timelessness of primordial purity.90. Mount Malaya has great significance for the transmission of the Buddha’s teachings. Itis one of the locations where the Buddha gave the third promulgation of his teachings. Itis also a sacred location for the Great Perfection. Garab Dorjé’s memory contained the sixmillion four hundred thousand verses of the Natural Great Perfection. Vajrasattva, afterconferring vase empowerment of awareness on him, commanded Garab Dorjé to writedown these verbal tantras. On the summit of Mount Malaya, Garab Dorjé—along withthe Indestructible Stainless Space Dakini, Yellow Exaltation Bestowing Dakini, and theDakini of Limitless Noble Qualities—spent three years recording and correctly arrang-ing these Great Perfection tantras.91. From “Blessings Swiftly Received,” p. 199.92. See The Words of My Perfect Teacher, p. 311.93.The Life of Shabkar, p. xviii.94. Currently I am working on a translation of the life stories of the hundred great treasure-revealers, including concise life stories of Guru Rinpoché, Yeshé Tsogyal, King TrisongDéutsen, and the twenty-five disciples.95. This is a play on words as Yeshé Dorjé is both the name of the relative Lama Dudjom Rin-poché, as well as a designation of the ultimate Lama, “indestructible wisdom.” 96. The four training methods (’dul ba rnam par bzhi) are the four kinds of training of thesupreme emanation body: training by the great merit of wisdom body (sku bsod namschen pos ’dul ba); training by the direct perception of wisdom mind (thugs mngon sumpas ’dul ba); training by inconceivable miraculous abilities (rdzu ’phrul bsam gyis mikhyab pas ’dul ba); and training by knowledge conveyed in wisdom speech (gsung rig pas’dul ba). See NSTB, pp. 131–2; and Myriad Worlds, p. 96 and p. 264, n. 4.97. The fourth guide (rnam ’dren bzhi) refers to Shakyamuni Buddha, who is the fourthbuddha out of one thousand that will manifest in this fortunate eon.98. Dudjom Lingpa, His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoché’s previous life, has incarnated for thebenefit of beings as numerous great noble beings, taking various sublime forms such asan enemy-destroyer (arhat), awareness-holder (vidyadhara), wisdom scholar (pandita),and accomplished master (siddha), in both India and Tibet. His series of lives includesome of the most sublime beings throughout Buddhist history, as seen in the previousprayer, The Pearl Necklace: A Supplication to the Series of Lives of His Holiness DudjomRinpoché. The Sanskrit word arhat was translated into Tibetan as drachompa, whichmeans “enemy-destroyer,” one who has destroyed the enemy of the passions. This is atitle given to those initial disciples of Buddha who showed externally the path of theHearer Vehicle (Shravakayana). The Sanskrit word vidyadhara was translated intoTibetan as rikdzin (rig ’dzin)and is the title given to those who have become fully enlight-Notes411Wisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 411"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"ened buddhas through the Secret Mantra Vehicle (Mantrayana). The Sanskrit word pan-dita was translated into Tibetan as khépa(mkhas pa), which means “wisdom scholar.”This refers to someone who has reached the highest levels of Buddist scholarship, basednot only upon intellectual knowledge, but also upon wisdom through practice—thus“wisdom” scholar. The Sanskrit word siddhawas translated into Tibetan as druptob(grubthob), which means “accomplished master.” Siddha comes from the same Sanskrit rootas siddhi, which was translated into Tibetan as ngödrup(dngos grub), which means “spir-itual attainment.” The ultimate siddhi is that of becoming a fully enlightened buddha.99. A reference to Sertak in the Golok region of eastern Tibet where Dudjom Lingpa wasborn.100. As Dudjom Rinpoché mentions here, the Nub clan was a source of myriad scholars andaccomplished masters, beginning with the great Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé (gnubs chensangs rgyas ye shes). According to Dudjom Rinpoché (NSTB, pp. 607–16) NupchenSangyé Yeshé was born in 832 c.e.In his youth he received from Padmasambhava theempowerment of the Eight Transmitted Precepts and later received many tantras andpith instructions. He also relied upon many great masters in India and Nepal such as ShriSingha and Vimalamitra. In his autobiography (Collected Works of Dudjom Lingpa, vol.dza, pp. 105–397), Dudjom Lingpa mentions that there are five family lineages accord-ing to Chinese astrology (ma ha tsi ni) with correspondences of five families, five col-ors, and five elements: the Dong (sdong) family corresponds to the color brown and theearth element; the Ra (dbra) family to white and iron; the Dru (’gru) family to blue andwater; and the Ga (sga) family to green and wood. Dudjom Lingpa writes that his fatherwas of the Achak Dru clan (a lchags ’gru) and his mother was of the Mu Tshaga family(dmu tsha sga). In earlier times the Dru clan came to the province of Nub (gnubs), whichgave rise to many sublime beings such as the aforementioned Sangyé Yeshé (sangsrgyas ye shes) and Gelong Namkhai Nyingpo (dge slong nam mkha’i snying po). Thisis called the family lineage of Nub. One group of this lineage, slowly over time, migratedeastward to the provence of Kham. Thus, this family lineage dispersed through outKham and Do-mé. Dudjom Lingpa’s father is connected to this lineage, that of the Nubfamily’s lesser lineage of Rung, which was a very noble family that also gave rise tomany realized beings. His name was Aten (a bstan), and his mother’s name was Bo Dzok(bo rdzogs).101. When Dudjom Lingpa entered his mother’s womb, he was accompanied by countlessdakinis with a shower of auspicious flowers raining down. His mother had many dreamsin which dakas and dakinis provided protection and bathed him.102. This probably refers to an instance related in Dudjom Lingpa’s autobiography thatoccurred at the age of nine. On the night of the seventh day of the first month of winter,a dakini clad in a blue woolen cloak came to Dudjom Lingpa and told him that in thecoming year he should travel to the northwest in order to meet a spiritual master namedJamyang who was an incarnation of the master Namkhai Nyingpo. With him DudjomLingpa would study and learn how to read and write. Dudjom Lingpa recounts that thedakini then gave him a skullcup filled with nectar that he drank in one gulp and hisentired body became filled with great exaltation.103. Manjushri is the lord of the Tathagata family; Chenrezi is the lord of the Padma family;and Vajrapani is the lord of the Vajra family.104. The Glorious Copper-Colored Mountain is the pure land where Guru Rinpoché abides.105. Here, “inferior tainted bliss” refers to the falling essence, and “sublime unconditionedpure conduct” refers to the sustaining bliss. These are terms used in the channels-energypractice (rtsa-rlung) of Anuyoga.106.

According to Dudjom Rinpoché, Bérotsana traveled from his native NyemoCakar in Tibet to the Great Nine-Storey Temple created by the miraculous power of themaster Shri Singha. Bérotsana requested and received teaching on the effortless vehicleof Atiyoga. Shri Singha wrote down for Bérotsana the eighteen esoteric instructions ofthe Mind Class. In addition, Shri Singha bestowed upon him all the empowerments andesoteric instructions of the sixty tantras, along with the three branches of the VastExpanse Class, the white, black, and variegated, which reveal that the goal is already nat-urally present. Shri Singha also taught Bérotsana the three ways to bring forth the fruitof instructions, the four cases when the teaching should be granted, and the four caseswhen they should not.

Kyabjé Chadral Rinpoché, born in the province of Kham in the year 1913, is oneof the greatest Lamas of our time. He is a lineage holder of many lineages, including hisprimary lineage of the Longchen Nyingtikas well as Dudjom Rinpoché’s New Treasurelineage. In a treasure prophecy by the treasure-revealer Péma Dügyal it was said,“Supreme heart emanation of Guru Rinpoché, a son blessed by Vimalamitra, will be bornin the Ox Year with the name of ‘Dorjé,’ will propagate the practice lineage, and willmake it flourish.” According to Lopön Jigmé, Chadral Rinpoché received the transmissionof the cycle of hidden treasure texts of Dudjom Lingpa directly from Dudjom Lingpa’syoungest son, Dorjé Dradül (1891–1959). Tulku Thondup writes that Chadral Rinpochéalso received Sera Khandro’s cycle of hidden treasure texts directly from Sera Khandroherself. For a concise life story of Chadral Rinpoché, see Masters of Meditation and Mir-aclesby Tulku Thondup, pp. 296–7. 173.

The six classes of beings are: hell beings, starving spirits, and animals—populating thethree lower realms; and humans, demi-gods, and gods—populating the three higherrealms. 238. The mind of awakening of aspiration is the wish to attain enlightenment for the benefitof all sentient beings. The mind of awakening of application is actually to engage in prac-tice to actualize the mind of awakening of aspiration.

The four obscurations (sgrib pa bzhi) are karmic obscurations (las kyi sgrib pa); theobscuration of passions (nyon mongs kyi sgrib pa); conceptual obscuration or the obscu-ration of not knowing (shes bya’i sgrib pa); and the obscuration of habitual tendencies(bag chags kyi sgrib pa). When referred to as two obscurations, they are the obscurationsof the passions and conceptual obscurations. Karmic obscurations come from performingnon-virtuous actions, such as the ten non-virtuous actions (mi dge ba bcu). The obscu-ration of the passions refers to the obscurations caused by the three passions—anger,desire, and ignorance. The three passions are often categorized as five—anger, desire,ignorance, jealousy, and pride. The obscuration of not knowing is to take the threefoldsphere (’khor gsum) of subject, object, and action as solid, material, truly existent. Fromthe perspective of the vehicle of discourses (Sutrayana), the obscuration of habitual ten-dencies is a very subtle form of the obscuration of not knowing. From the Vajrayana per-spective it is the basis for sentient beings’ habits of ordinary body, speech, and mind. 241. The four wisdom bodies, or kayas, are dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, andsvabhavikakaya. For an excellent and concise understanding of the wisdom bodies I highlyrecommend Dungsé Thinley Norbu Rinpoché’s Small Golden Key, pp. 68–93.242.

The people of the kingdom recognized him, and themalevolent government minister [whose son he killed] and others tried to burn him ona pyre of sandalwood. He again demonstrated a miracle by appearing with his consort ona lotus in the center of a lake. As a symbol of liberating beings from the wheel of life hewore a garland of skulls.

She was hisprincipal intimate companion during his stay in Tibet and one of his main representativesafter his departure.” Guru Rinpoché: His Life and Times, p. 304.

For YeshéTsogyal’s extensive life story, see Lady of the Lotus-Born: The Life and Enlightenmentof Yeshé Tsogyal, translated by the Padmakara Translation Group. This is a translation ofa treasure text that was revealed by the treasure-revealer Samten Lingpa and committedto writing by Gyalwa Changchub and Namkhai Nyingpo.267. The three places are on, under, and above the ground.268. The Tibetan word rikden(rigs ldan), meaning “ruler,” refers to Shambhala’s kings; hereit is used as an honorific for a ruler. Dudjom Rinpoché is lauding a local ruler as a line-age-bearing ruler of Shambhala.269. The three roots are the Lama, Wisdom Deity (yi dam), and Dakini (mkha’ ’gro).270. The three blazes (’bar ba gsum) are: the blazing of blissful warmth in the body (lus la bdedrod ’bar ba); the blazing of potency in speech (ngag la nus pa ’bar ba); and the blazingof realization in the mind (sems la rtogs pa ’bar ba).271. The three gatherings (’du ba gsum) are: the gathering of people during the day (nyinmor mi ’du ba); the gathering of dakinis by night (mtshan mor mkha’ ’gro ’du ba); andthe gathering of material resources at all times (rtag tu zas nor ’du ba).272. The three bodhisattvas’ names are woven in the praise in this first verse. Sun of Speech(smra ba’i nyi ma) is an epithet of Manjushri; Treasure of Compassion (snying rje’i gter)refers to Chenrezi; and Lord of Secrets (gsang bdag) is Vajrapani.273. In the text, brag mgois a spelling mistake for brag ’go, which the locals in eastern Tibetpronounce Drango. It’s a town at a junction in eastern Tibet; from there one road goestoward Ganzé, the other toward Sertak, Dudjom Lingpa’s home town.274. Zhogpa is a place in the region of upper Ü east of Lhasa.275. In the Tibetan, marks are used to designate the syllables that comprise Dudjom Rin-poché’s name, Ye-shé [primordial wisdom] Dor-jé [vajra]. In the body of this prayer ital-ics have been used to replicate the Tibetan. 422NotesWisdom Nectar_Rebuild_New APP 6/30/09 11:22 AM Page 422"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"276.

Twofold supreme knowledge (mkhyen pa gnyis) refers to the primordial wisdom thatknows the abiding nature as it is (gnas lugs ji lta ba mkhyen pa’i ye shes) and the pri-mordial wisdom that perceives all that exists (shes bya ji rnyed pa gzigs pa’i ye shes).Translation note: I am using the superlative “supreme” to distinguish between “intellec-tual” knowledge and the knowledge of a realized being, translated here as “supremeknowledge” (mkhyen). A precedent for this can be found in Sanskrit and Tibetan Bud-dhist language. For instance, to distinguish the ultimate, non-dualistic state of empti-ness—mahashunyatain Sanskrit—from the various levels of emptiness— shunyata—the modifier maha(“great”) is used. In Tibetan, the adjective chen po(“great”) is addedto tong-nyi(“emptiness”).278. This and the two lines above contain the name of Dudjom Rinpoché, Jigdral Yeshé Dorjé. 279. Orgyen Dorjé Chang is the dharmakaya aspect of Guru Rinpoché.280. There is a spelling mistake in the last line in Tibetan: dben sbyorshould be dbyen sbyor,meaning “to disrupt” or “to agitate.”281. Literally, “forces my heart’s circulating energy into my upper body.”282. As recounted in A Biography of Guru Rinpoché by Jamgön Kongtrul: “In thirteen placesnamed ‘Tiger’s Den,’ such as Néring Sengé Dzong in Mönka [Bhutan], he took the formof an uncontrollably wrathful deity, bound all the major and minor arrogant gods andcannibal demons of Tibet under oath, and entrusted them with guardianship of the treas-ure texts. At that time he [Guru Rinpoché] was known as Vajra Sagging Belly [DorjéDrolö].” Guru Rinpoché: His Life and Times, translated by Ngawang Zangpo, p. 126.According to another tradition for understanding the meaning of the name Drolö (grolod), Dro (gro) refers to liberation, and lö (lod) refers to the world. Dorjé Drolö couldthen be translated as Vajra Liberator of the World.283. My Lama explains yidamas follows. Yidmeans “mind,” and damrefers to an insepara-ble bond based upon pure samaya. Each practitioner has a special deity with whom theyhave a connection.284. Orgyen, the second Buddha, is Guru Rinpoché. This prayer is to the master, Guru Rin-poché; the scholar, Shantarakshita; and the king who protects the Buddha’s teachings,Trisong Déutsen. Together they are sometimes referred to in prayers and texts as “themaster, the scholar, and the king who protect the Buddha’s teachings.”285. “The Teacher” refers to Buddha.286.
