This particular chapter presents the complete system of theindestructible way (vajrayåna) of secret mantra. The publication of thiswork is greatly needed and will be very helpful to all who are currentlystudying or doing research in the Tibetan traditions of Buddhism.Buddha, the teacher, taught innumerable spiritual methods to guidesentient beings on the path to freedom. Fortunate ones with acute intel-ligence practice the heart of these teachings, the indestructible way ofsecret mantra. This way has many special qualities. It is superior to thepath of the sutras, includes many methods of practice, does not involvehardships, and is clear, direct, and enjoyable.This book brings together, in their depth and breadth, the essentialpoints of the four sets of tantra comprised by the indestructible way ofsecret mantra. It describes the classification of practices, the initiationsthat provide entry, the vows and commitments, the two phases of prac-tice, the forms of conduct, and the standard and special attainments.First, by appreciating and understanding just what is contained here,you will, so to speak, have an eye that sees the profound significance ofthe tantras of secret mantra. Then, you will be inspired by faith andappreciation for the indestructible way. Through study you come tounderstand the nature of being. Through reflection you find convictionin that understanding.

These are referred to as theFive Great Treasuries (mDzod chen lnga). The first to be produced was TheEncompassment of All Knowledge, which was followed by The Treasury ofMantra of the Kagyu School, The Treasury of Key Instructions, The Treasury ofPrecious Treasure Teachings, and The Treasury of Vast Teachings. Because ofthe unequalled scholarship shown in these works, Kongtrul came to be calledJamgön (’Jam mgon), Gentle Protector, which is an epithet of Manjushri,the bodhisattva who symbolizes higher wisdom.Kongtrul’s huge literary output gives the impression that his primaryfocus was compilation and writing. This was not the case; most of his lifewas spent meditating and teaching. He composed the verses of The Encom-passment of All Knowledge, for instance, between periods of meditation whilehe was living in seclusion at his hermitage, Kunzang Dechen Ösel Ling, ineastern Tibet. Kongtrul wrote this work in response to a request by NgedönTenpa Rabgyé, the first Dazang incarnation, who asked that he produce atreatise on the three systems of Buddhist ethics: the vows of personal libera-tion in the individual way (h¦nay›na), the commitments of the bodhisattvain the universal way (mah›y›na), and the pledges (samaya) of the aware-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAness-holder in the indestructible way (vajray›na). Kongtrul decided to writea book that not only set out the three ethics but also contained a full presen-tation of all aspects of the Buddhist path from the perspectives of thesethree systems. Indeed, The Encompassment of All Knowledge touches on allfields of spiritual knowledge as well as the related secular sciences known atthe time of its composition.Kongtrul presented the finished manuscript of Encompassment to JamyangKyentsé Wangpo (1820–1892), another outstanding figure in the revivalof the teachings in eastern Tibet, who, highly impressed, declared thework to be “a treasury of knowledge . . . the first of your five treasuries.”Kyentsé urged him to write a commentary on it. In 1863, Kongtrul com-posed a three-volume commentary on these root verses, entitled The Infi-nite Ocean of Knowledge, completing it in less than four months. Thework was revised a year later with the help of Trashi Özer, the abbot ofPalpung Monastery.The Encompassment of All Knowledge, together with its commentary TheInfinite Ocean of Knowledge, has come to be known as The Treasury of Knowl-edge. In Tibetan religious literature, the work stands out as a unique master-piece embodying the entirety of the theories and methods of implementationof the Buddhist doctrine as it was preserved in Tibet. It comprises ten books:the first book concerns the sphere of activity of the Buddha; the second,Buddha, the Teacher; the third, the nature of his teachings; the fourth, thespread of the teachings; the fifth, training in ethics; the sixth, study of te-nets; the seventh, training in wisdom; the eighth, training in meditation; theninth, the stages and paths of spiritual development; and the tenth, the result.Each book contains four chapters in order to treat all aspects of the subjectsfrom the perspectives of the different traditions. The encyclopedic presenta-tion of this Treasury, summarizing a broad range of history, views, traditions,and practices in an orderly and insightful fashion, reveals an author with anexceptionally broad intellect and deep experiential understanding.THIS BOOKBook Six of The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge presents the theoretical bases ofpractice. Systems of Buddhist Tantra: The Indestructible Way of Secret Mantrais the translation of the fourth chapter, which concerns the tradition of theindestructible way. As this single chapter is of considerable length, the trans-lation has been divided into twenty short chapters, with chapter titles givenby the translators."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000213The indestructible way of secret mantra (gsang sngags rdo rje theg pa)refers to the tantric path, the essence of which is the indestructible union ofwisdom (understanding of emptiness) and method (immutable great bliss).The distinctive feature of this path lies in the special skill in method andwisdom used to manifest innate pristine awareness, the primordial groundof being. In this work, the author sets forth the various systems that consti-tute this way, those of both the ancient tantra tradition and the new tradi-tion. Kongtrul begins with an overview of tantra, its placement in theBuddhist collections of teachings, and reasons for its superiority over otherpaths. He then presents the four sets of tantra of the new tradition—actiontantra, conduct tantra, yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra—differentiat-ing them in terms of their natures, views, ways of entry, methods of medita-tion, forms of conduct, and results. The work concludes with an expositionof the ninefold way of the ancient tradition, culminating in atiyoga: know-ing all things to be the pristine awareness of pure and total presence.While Systems of Buddhist Tantra presents in detail the underlying prin-ciples of the various systems of tantra, with particular emphasis on the highestyoga tantra of the new schools, it does not reveal esoteric instructions forpractice, which are the domain of oral transmissions and specialized manu-als. Moreover, it does not include the historical origins and developmentsof the tantric systems, which Kongtrul treats in depth in other parts of histreasury. What follows now is an introduction to the nature of the tantricpath, touching on some of the major themes treated in this important sec-tion of The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge.THE MEANING OF TANTRATo those who would embark on a quest for awakening, the Tibetan tradi-tions of Buddhism offer three markedly different and seemingly incompat-ible sequences of practices: the individual way (h¦nay›na); the universal way(mah›y›na); and the tantric way or secret mantra way (mantray›na).While finding its foundation in the idealism (vijì›nav›da) and centrism(m›dhyamika) trends of thought, the tantric way undoubtedly sprang fromthe irresistible drive to know the nature of experience directly, unmediatedby cognitive interpretation or emotional confusion. Consequently, it relieson an awareness that is an expression of the inner clarity present in our verybeing and not on knowledge derived from rational, philosophical, or con-ceptual processes.Tantra consists of a skillful blending of three different types of practice:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRApower methods, energy transformation methods, and intrinsic awarenessmethods. These methods came from a variety of sources and gradually formedinto identifiable esoteric transmissions. Some practices were designed to breakdown social and cultural conditioning and others were developed to utilizebasic energies in the body (including sexual energy) to enhance practice.Etymologically, the word tantra is derived from the term for woof orweft, the thread that runs continuously through the fabric in traditionalweaving methods. In Tibetan, the word means “continuum.” Both thesemeanings refer to the fundamental tantric perspective that the awarenessthat is the essence of being is always present, because it is not a thing, is notcreated, destroyed or subject to variation.Although the terms tantra and mantra are often used interchangeably,they do have distinct meanings. Mantra denotes the pristine awareness ofreality, the essence of which is emptiness and bliss, while tantra refers to thesystems of implementation of such awareness for the sake of performingrituals and specific activities. The term mantra also serves as an abbreviationfor “secret mantra” (guhyamantra), where mantra signifies “that which pro-tects the mind” from dissipation due to ordinary perceptions and attach-ment to them. Mantras are commonly understood as incantations comprisingseries of syllables or words to be recited or visualized. Although this mean-ing may well have been the origin of the expression “secret mantra,” thisrepresents only one of its minor aspects. Even the lower tantras, which stressthe need for ritual activity, clearly state that, as means to gain realization,mantra recitation is secondary to formless contemplation. Mantra is called“secret” not to suggest the secretiveness of cults but because the path ofmantra must be practiced in secret in order to be successful and withheldfrom unfit receptacles who could misuse it.The term tantra is also used to refer to the essential meaning of mantra,as well as the entirety of the way of secret mantra. The first distinction to bemade with respect to tantra is between tantra as the meaning, or contentitself, and tantra as words or scriptures, the means for its transmission. TheContinuation of the Guhyasamaja provides an encapsulation of tantra in termsof the meaning and its different aspects:Tantra denotes continuousness.It is composed of three aspects:Ground, nature, and inalienableness.When distinguished in this way,The nature aspect is the cause;"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000215The ground aspect refers to the method;And inalienableness, the result.These three contain tantra’s meaning.Tantra as continuousness, or continuum (rgyud), refers to the uninter-rupted presence of the original nature, or state of being, of each individual.In Buddhist scriptures, this original nature is principally referred to as “mind”(sems), as in “ever-perfect mind” (kun tu bzang po’i sems) or “mind nature”(sems nyid). In this context, “mind” does not mean object-bound experi-ence but instead the ever-perfect and intrinsic awareness that has no begin-ning or end. Since it is free from the dichotomy of knower and known, thismind is no different from the reality it perceives. Reality is a “continuum”in the sense that its nature does not change into something else and cannotbe fragmented into parts. Regardless of the degree of evolution or debase-ment of an individual, that reality or ever-perfect mind remains unalteredas the very essence or nucleus of one’s being. From the state of an ordinaryindividual, the beginning, so to speak, up to the end of awakening, suchreality is unceasingly present. Hence, there is no ultimate distinction be-tween an ordinary being and an awakened one.Tantra, or continuum, although not subject to modification or parti-tion, may be considered from the perspectives of non-recognition (condi-tioned existence), semi-recognition (the path), and total recognition(awakening) of original being. Based on these three phases, tantra is setforth in terms of its three aspects: actuality, process, and result.Continuum as actuality (rang bzhin), though deemed causal (rgyu), doesnot mean the presence of the original state of being as a mere potential to beactualized in the future. Actuality points to the full presence of originalbeing, even when it is not recognized. Lack of recognition is like a veil orcloud of unawareness which, however thick, does not pollute the very na-ture of one’s original state. As explained by the Third Karmapa RangjungDorjé, actuality means “an awakened being attended by stains.” Althoughaccompanied by impurity, the being remains the same, just as a gold statuewrapped in rags is still a gold statue. “Causal” indicates that it is the fun-damental element which when recognized is reaffirmed in its nature ofenlightenment.Actuality is not defined as an absolute and static emptiness. Its power ofmanifestation or “radiance” (mdangs), owing to unawareness of its natureand to emotional patterns related to unawareness, becomes the basis for theparticular appearances or visions that seem to bind one. When the veils of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAunawareness and emotional patterns lessen to some extent, there arise purevisions and contemplative experiences reflecting the essential purity of theactuality. When unawareness and emotional patterns are fully recognized asthe mere play of the manifesting power of reality, the entire breadth of thepotential of one’s being unfolds.Continuum as process, or method (thabs), refers to all of the variousmeans by which one may recognize one’s original nature or being. Thesemeans are not restricted to those found in Buddhist traditions. In the high-est forms of tantra, continuum as a process is primarily represented in thephase of generation (bskyed rim, utpatti krama) and phase of completion(rdzogs rim, niøpanna krama) and their ancillary aspects. This process, inbeing the cooperative condition for coming to know one’s original state ofbeing, is likened to manure spread over a field in order to nurture the growthof seeds. However, unlike the example, the very essence of the process doesnot involve external intervention but is simply original being recognizingitself. This process in tantra reflects, and is the exercise of, freedom andawakening, not in the sense of a goal attained but as a way of existing thatmanifests directly in every situation of life. The continuum aspect of themethod or process exists in the relationship between the process and theoriginal state of being, in the interdependent connections between the vari-ous aspects of the process, in the uninterrupted lineage of transmission ofesoteric instructions, and in the contemplations and ensuing experiences.In the ultimate sense, the actuality continuum, or causal continuum,does not denote a cause or seed that produces an effect since it alreadyrepresents the fullest result. The process continuum does not refer to anouter agent but instead to an unfolding of what is already present. Likewise,the continuum as result, that of “inalienableness” (mi ’phrogs pa), does notmean the result of a pursuit or the attainment of a goal but the primordialcondition itself. It is inalienable in that it has always been the authenticmode of being, never alienated by the split that occurs when one’s truenature is not recognized. It remains unmodified by the duality of condi-tioned existence and perfect peace, even when one is immersed in the seem-ingly real troubles of life.The reality represented by tantra is known as the “authentic condition”(gnas lugs), which comprises that of both the inner and the outer, one’smind and body and the totality of one’s world. However, this authenticcondition primarily refers to the luminous clarity (’od gsal) of one’s mind,or pristine awareness, which all of the various tantric systems seek to mani-fest by way of their different methods."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000217THE DOCTRINAL BASIS OF TANTRAThe tantric systems incorporate all aspects of the Buddhist teachings, which,over the course of time, have served as their doctrinal bases. In particular,one central theory, which underlies every Buddhist approach, seems to bereflected in all the essential principles constituting the views and practicesof tantra: that there exists an “element” (khams, dh›tu) that enables anordinary person to become a sublime being. That element is not the illu-sory and unreal self, the existence of which is negated on all levels ofBuddhist philosophy. How then is it posited? The idea of such an “ele-ment” can be found in the more ancient form of Buddhism. In that con-text, as expressed by the analysts (vaibh›øikas), and reflecting the characterof a personal pursuit of liberation, it is known as “exalted affinity” (’phagspa’i rigs, ›rya gotra). It is defined as detachment from conditioned existenceand worldly possessions and characterized as a state of contentment andhaving few desires.From this basic formulation, the theory regarding this element has un-dergone a process of modification and refinement. For example, in the tra-ditionalist (sautr›ntika) view, which represents a slightly more sophisticatedphilosophical trend than that of the analysts, the element is understood asnot simply detachment but as a “seed,” an aspect of the mind capable ofgrowing into supreme wisdom.Around the time of the Third Buddhist Council, which took place twohundred and thirty-six years after the demise of the Buddha, the majorityof the monastic community was turning attention to the needs and inter-ests of the laity and trying to increase the chances for ordinary people toenter the path to freedom. This movement was accompanied by doctrinaltransformations as a result of which the arhat or “saint” as the model forfollowers lost its pre-eminence. A new model emerged, that of thebodhisattva, who is willing to mingle with ordinary beings while workingfor their welfare and who, at the end of his or her spiritual career, achievesthe goal of full awakening. Since the path of the bodhisattva leads thepractitioner to the state of a buddha, or a “transcendent one” (tath›gata),the element capable of turning into that state came to be known in theuniversal way tradition as the “essence of the transcendent ones”(tath›gatagarbha) or “essence of enlightenment,” also referred to simply asbuddha nature.The two main philosophical trends within the universal way, that of theexperientialists (yog›c›ra) and that of the centrists (m›dhyamika), view such"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAan element in ways that accord with their own basic tenets. The formerasserts the element to be a potential present in the continuum of mind sincetime without beginning, capable of developing into the entire range ofqualities of an awakened being. The latter asserts that it is the very natureof the mind (and of all phenomena) at the stage when mind is still at-tended by the stains of emotional patterns and limitations with regard toknowledge.However defined, the essence of enlightenment corresponds to what intantra is called “actuality” or the “causal continuum” (rgyu’i rgyud, hetutantra), the original ground of being to be recognized as enlightenmentitself. Thus, when we consider the above three aspects of tantra, it becomesapparent that tantra is based primarily on the theory of the essence of en-lightenment or tath›gatagarbha. Although ancient practices of pre-Buddhistorigin were absorbed into the Buddhist tantric systems, it is this theory ofBuddhist origin—the essence of enlightenment—that may be said to bethe fundamental basis, or core teaching, from which tantra developed.THE ESSENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENTThe essence of enlightenment (bde bar gshegs pa’i snying po, tath›gatagarbha)is taught in the Shrimala and a number of other universal way sutras, yetscholars seem to have struggled to define precisely its real nature. Someconsider the essence to be an actual buddha, while others conceive of it as apotential that can evolve into the awakened state. This essence has been thesubject of extensive philosophical speculation in ancient Tibet, the effect ofwhich is still felt in present-day Tibetan schools.In his commentary on Maitreya’s Jewel Affinity (Ratnagotravibh›ga),Kongtrul defines the element or essence, also known as affinity (rigs, gotra),as an unpolluted factor on the basis of which an individual can rediscoverthe ground of being. Referred to in the scriptures by various terms, such asineffable emptiness, mind nature of luminous clarity, and ground-of-allconsciousness, “element” does not carry the meaning of “cause” but insteaddenotes a “nucleus” that is hidden by obscurations. Kongtrul points outthat the Tibetan term snying po (essence) is used to translate a number ofSanskrit terms, such as garbha, in which case the term indicates that theelement is like a kernel inside a husk; hridaya, meaning essence in the senseof supreme, indicating that the element is the supreme phenomenon, thevery reality of all phenomena; and sara, robust or firm, pointing to theunchangeable and indivisible nature of such reality."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000219The essence of enlightenment is thus equated with the very reality thatpervades both the animate and inanimate world. How such an essence isunderstood would obviously depend on how reality is defined in a particu-lar system. Within the different philosophical trends of Tibetan Buddhism(all of which claim to represent the centrist view), we can distinguish twomain approaches: one considers reality to be emptiness as an absolute nega-tion; the other, emptiness as an affirmative negation, that is to say, an emp-tiness that is not simply emptiness but luminosity or potency as well. It isthis second view that most accords with how the essence of enlightenmentis understood in the tantras.Luminosity, which is of the same nature as emptiness, means the lumi-nous clarity of the mind of every sentient being. Each being thus embodiesthe reality of the totality of the universe and stands at the center of theuniverse as its nature or “creator.” Luminous clarity is the principal featureof the essence of enlightenment and in the tantras is spoken of as actualityor the causal continuum characterized by bliss.The uninterrupted presence of the causal continuum encompasses thethree dimensions of awakening: empty like the sky, it is the reality dimen-sion (dharmak›ya); luminous like the sun and moon, it is the enjoymentdimension (sambhogak›ya); and manifesting unimpededly in every form, itis the manifest dimension of awakening (nirm›òak›ya). In this way, theessence of enlightenment is not simply a seed or potential that can developinto the state of awakening but is the state of awakening itself. This is taughtin all tantras with definitiveness. The chapter called “Pristine Awareness” inthe Kalachakra Tantra, for instance, states:All beings are buddhas. Another supreme buddha does not exist inthis universe.And the Hevajra states:Sentient beings are actually buddhasBut are obscured by adventitious stains.When these are cleared away, they awaken.If beings are already enlightened, why do they still suffer the misery ofconditioned existence? Saraha’s Doha states:The natural condition is not seen by the childish.Due to deception, the childish are swindled."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe point of tantric practice is to overcome habitual emotional patternsand, in particular, coemergent unawareness of the essence of enlightenment.When the adventitious stains that cloud one’s nature are removed by meansof the path, the essence reveals itself as the real buddha, and one reawakensinto one’s state of primordial enlightenment.As long as the state of enlightenment is not recognized, beings continueto experience illusory birth and death, along with the happiness and suffer-ing inherent in conditioned existence. However, whatever the experience,the essence of enlightenment remains unpolluted, unobscured, and unmodi-fied, just as sunlight maintains its nature of light regardless of the type ofobject it strikes. The essence is not conditioned by any form of embodiedlife, whether fortunate or miserable, nor is it conditioned by any act, goodor evil, or by knowledge or lack of knowledge. Although the essence isattended by impurity, its nature, like gold embedded in ore, remains alwayspure, untouched by emotional afflictions and conceptions.THE ESSENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT AND THE GROUND OF ALLIn the writings of ancient masters of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Bud-dhism, with which Kongtrul was affiliated, certain technical terms withvery different meanings were often used interchangeably. For example, theword mind (sems), normally denoting object-bound dualistic experience, isalso used to refer to mind nature (sems nyid), or mind’s real condition.Likewise, in this section of The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge the essence ofenlightenment (or causal continuum) is called the “ground-of-all conscious-ness” (kun gzhi rnam shes, ›layavijì›na). This seemingly free use of terms isnot an indication of scholastic laxity but actually reflects the characteristicviews of this school.An apparent equation of the essence of enlightenment with the ground-of-all consciousness is found in sutras such as the Descent to Lanka(Laºk›vat›ra) and the Gandavyuhasutra, as well as in Ashvaghosha’s Awak-ening of Faith and other commentaries. In the Infinite Ocean, Kongtrul notesthat the ground-of-all consciousness is known in the individualist systemby particular terms such as “substratum consciousness” (rtsa ba’i rnam shes,málavijì›na), “the aggregate that lasts as long as cyclic existence” (’khor baji srid pa’i phung po), and “branch of existence” (srid pa’i yan lag). Bothcentrist and idealist philosophies speak of the “eightfold group ofconsciousnesses” (rnam shes tshogs brgyad), which, as stated in theGandavyuhasutra, comprises the mind or ground-of-all consciousness, the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000221subjective mind of an afflicted nature, and the six consciousnesses that ap-prehend objects. The subjective mind (yid) is an ever-present conceitedmental state that carries the sense of “I” and is therefore known as afflictedmind (nyon mongs can gyi yid). The six sense consciousnesses (includingconsciousness of mind) are aspects of the mind that focus on details ofobjects and are therefore known as “six active consciousnesses” (’jug pa’irnam shes tshogs drug).The ground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes) is a mind, amount-ing to an accumulation of karmic traces, that leads to embodied existence.It focuses on a variety of objects but cognizes only their presence, not thedetails. Although itself neutral, the ground-of-all consciousness is capableof storing all of the traces or habitual tendencies of virtuous andnonvirtuous actions. Unlike other aspects of the mind, the ground-of-allconsciousness is steady and persists throughout all mental states, evendeep sleep. At death, it is projected by the force of its inherent karmic tracesinto a new existence.Two aspects of the ground-of-all consciousness are distinguished: thepotential and the fruitional. The potential aspect consists in karmic traces.The fruitional aspect consists in the ground-of-all consciousness that is theresult of karmic traces. According to the universalists, after the “diamond-like meditative absorption” which leads directly into awakening, the ground-of-all consciousness in its fruitional aspect transforms into mirror-like pristineawareness (me long ye shes, ›darŸajì›na). The ground-of-all consciousness isso named because it serves as the ground for both cyclic existence (saôs›ra)and perfect peace (nirv›òa). However, as explained by Kongtrul, it does notdenote a single, permanent creator of the universe as postulated by the Hin-dus. Instead, the ground-of-all consciousness is said to be intrinsic to everysentient being and of a momentary nature.Asanga, the fourth-century Indian scholar considered by many to be thepioneer of experientialist philosophy (in which the ground-of-all conscious-ness constitutes a central tenet), equates this consciousness with mind(citta) and includes it in the impermanent aggregate of consciousness(vijì›na-skandha).1 Does this implicitly negate the ground-of-all conscious-ness as the essence of enlightenment and the ground of all? Indeed, thiswould seem to be the case. However, in The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge,Kongtrul cites a verse from the Phenomenology Scripture (Abhidharmasátra,mNgon pa’i mdo), a text no longer extant, when discussing the ground-of-all consciousness as commonly understood in experientialist philosophyand when defining the essence of enlightenment (chapter eight of this"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAbook). This verse, found in the Discourse That Teaches the Essence of En-lightenment (sNying po bstan pa’i mdo) and cited in Asanga’s commentaryon it, states:The dimension with no beginning in timeIs the abode of all phenomena.Owing to its being, cyclic lifeAnd perfect peace are experienced.Since this verse is cited in both contexts, one must assume that Kongtrulsomehow equates the essence of enlightenment with the ground-of-all con-sciousness. Given the contradictory definitions of these two, what are thereasons for taking them to be synonymous?The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorjé, considered to be the source ofthe view underlying the Kagyu style of presentation of tantra, states thatthe root of all types of pristine awareness is the ground-of-all pristineawareness; and the root of all types of consciousness, the ground-of-allconsciousness. The inseparability of these two is called “ordinary aware-ness” (tha mal gyi shes pa). Because ordinary awareness serves as the fun-damental element for awakening, it is referred to as the “essence ofenlightenment.” Here, the expression “ordinary awareness” denotes theordinary state of consciousness, a blend of two aspects: the primordialaspect called pristine awareness (ye shes, jì›na); and the aspect of object-bound experience called consciousness (rnam shes, vijì›na), in this case,the ground-of-all consciousness, the “mother” of all object-bound experi-ences. Recognized for what it is, ordinary awareness is the pristine aware-ness of intrinsic awareness, a state that is known in and by itself.Unrecognized, it is unawareness. The “distance” between recognition andnon-recognition is inconceivably minute, with only a hair’s breadth ofspace separating them.Thus, the essence of enlightenment, or causal continuum, exists as in-separable from the ground-of-all consciousness, like water mixed with milk.In this sense, the two are equated, but are not considered identical. Thisparadox highlights the character of the original ground of being as open totwo different possibilities: when unrecognized, it possesses the faults of con-ditioned existence; once recognized, it reveals the qualities of the fruition.The character of the original ground of being is endowed with the potentialfor all manifestation. All manifestation has the character of the ground. It"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000223can only be recognized as it manifests embodied in the individual, whoseprincipal modes of existence are body, speech, and mind. Unrecognized, orunpurified, body, speech, and mind are reflections of illusion; recognized,they are the three dimensions of awakening.METHOD AND WISDOMMethod (thabs, up›ya) and wisdom (shes rab, prajìa), key principles in bothsutra and tantra, have particular meanings depending on the system. Theimmediate sense conveyed by “method” is the way to carry out an action,and by “wisdom,” the intelligence to recognize the appropriateness of theaction in any given situation. Related to those meanings, method denotesactivation of one’s energy, and wisdom, the knowledge of reality gainedfrom that activation of energy. In most systems of sutra and tantra, wisdomcan arise only when sufficient energy of merit has made one’s mind recep-tive to such wisdom and capable of sustaining it.In the universal way, the two principles are contained in the six “meansof transcendence” (p›ramit›), namely, generosity, ethics, patience, effort,meditation, and wisdom. Method comprises the first four, and wisdom, thelast two. Without wisdom, the other means of transcendence are “blind,”said Shantideva, meaning that they cannot lead to awakening. Why? Be-cause wisdom provides the understanding that phenomena have no intrin-sic nature and exist only as illusions. When permeated by this knowledge,generosity and the other means are free of adherence to the reality of theirreferents. Without wisdom, generosity, ethics, and so forth would fetterrather than liberate the individual. Wisdom alone would also fetter a per-son because he or she would not have the impetus to work for others’ free-dom and would therefore lack the basis for the attainment of awakening.Accordingly, Atisha said:Method divorced from wisdomOr wisdom without methodIs bondage: this has been taught.Thus, their union should not be neglected.Moreover, both method and wisdom are necessary because, reflecting thepsychophysical make-up of the person, awakening exists on two planes,that of the body, called the physical dimension (rápak›ya) and that of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAmind, the reality dimension (dharmak›ya). The concordant causes for theachievement of the two planes are, respectively, the merit accrued by thefirst four means of transcendence, and wisdom accrued by the last two.Method in the context of the universal way is primarily the mind ofawakening (bodhicitta), and wisdom, the understanding of emptiness(Ÿunyat›). On a relative level, the mind of awakening means the desire toawaken for the sake of others. On an ultimate level, the mind of awakeningis the concept-free knowing of reality or emptiness, endowed with the es-sence of compassion. This is the point in the bodhisattva’s path where methodand wisdom begin to merge.Although method and wisdom are often described as two wings neededon the course to freedom, the notion of two different elements implies aduality. Every path to realization, even the fundamental one, tries to over-come such duality by explaining ways to unify these two principles into asingle reality. It might well be said that the higher the system, the morerefined is its application of method and wisdom in a unified way.All of these points concerning method and wisdom in the universal wayapply to tantra as well. Furthermore, as shown in the rich imagery of thetantras, these two principles, while still retaining their meanings as under-stood in the lower ways, take on a variety of special meanings.From the common perspectives of the lower and highest tantras, methodgenerally stands for relative truth (kun rdzob bden pa, saôv ̧t¦ satya), andwisdom, ultimate truth (don dam bden pa, param›rtha satya). In contrastto non-tantric systems, where relative truth is taken to mean the worlds ofsuffering produced by negative emotions and the actions motivated bythem, in the context of tantra, relative truth means all appearances imag-ined as a divine world with divine residents. To imagine the world in thatway through symbolic creation of deities and mandalas activates thepractitioner’s innate pure energy. In order not to attribute inherent exist-ence to that pure vision requires the wisdom of recognizing this vision asfundamentally unreal. This wisdom can be gained by applying a subtle“deconstructive” analysis but in the uncommon way of the tantras is moreoften achieved by entering the nonconceptual or natural state, which isdevoid of the constructs of imagination. In this way, the practitioner real-izes the simultaneity of appearances (snang ba) and emptiness (stong pa).The two yogic applications of the method of creation and wisdom ofdeconstruction in the lower tantras are called yoga with signs (nimittayoga) and yoga without signs (animitta yoga), respectively, and in highest"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000225yoga tantra, phase of generation (utpatti krama) and phase of completion(niøpanna krama).Highest yoga tantra, as its name yoga, or union (rnal ’byor, yoga), de-notes, is characterized by the application of method and wisdom as an in-separable union. This is symbolized by tantric deities of this system depictedin sexual union. In this imagery, the male is method; the female, wisdom.In addition to their general meanings as explained above, in this context,the meaning of method is bliss (bde ba, sukha) produced by way of specialmeditations or union with a qualified consort; and that of wisdom, theunderstanding of innate reality, distinguished as being the very conscious-ness of that bliss. For the sake of training, method and wisdom are applied,in a sense, distinctly: first, bliss is generated and then united with the un-derstanding of the innate. In fact, wisdom is already inherent in the natureof method since knowledge of the innate is of the nature of bliss. Moreover,in the phase of completion, the realization of luminous clarity (’od gsal,prabh›svara) is wisdom, and the ensuing illusory body (sgyu lus, m›y›deha)of the deity actually manifesting is method.Thus, it is evident that the dual principles of method and wisdom arerepresented in different pairs of attributes—male and female, relative andultimate truth, yoga with signs and without signs, phase of generation andphase of completion, appearance and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, andillusory body and luminous clarity. In fact, all aspects comprised by tantracan be distinguished according to these principles. From this, one under-stands that the meaning of method and wisdom cannot be restricted tosimply the literal meaning of the two words.In the inner tantras of the ancient tradition, particularly anuyoga andatiyoga, we find a progressively finer gap between method and wisdom, butit is in atiyoga, or the “great perfection” (rdzogs chen), that the duality ofmethod and wisdom that characterizes the lower paths is totally transcended.Practice of atiyoga does not involve distinctions in method and wisdom orlevels of application since, according to the view of atiyoga, all that exists issimply a single reality, one’s own authentic condition, primordial awaken-ing, with no differentiation between relative and ultimate truths. This pointis made clear in the Total Space of Vajrasattva (rDo rje sems dpa’ nam mkha’che), a text of the mind division of atiyoga:A path to purity that proceeds from level to levelDoes not agree with the teaching of no action."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAIf there were truly paths to travel, one would neverReach one’s goal, just as there is no limit to space.and:The bliss of the intrinsically perfect stateIs found only in instantaneous presenceIlluminated by the power of matchless wisdom.Reality does not come from anything else.SAMSARA AND NIRVANASamsara, or cyclic existence (’khor ba), and nirvana, or perfect peace (myang’das), have gradually taken on the superficial meanings of “place of prob-lems” and “place of ecstasy.” What is defined as samsara in fundamentalBuddhism is not a physical place, but the state of the body and mind of aperson conditioned by habitual tendencies. This conditioned state entailsbeing subject to suffering such as that of birth, sickness, old age, and death.The illusory environment where this suffering is experienced is the out-come of the shared habitual tendencies and karmic traces of its inhabitants.Nirvana is the transcendence of such suffering, attained by applying a paththat overcomes the emotions and purifies their habitual patterns. This per-spective on samsara and nirvana is in contrast to that of certain Hinduschools that consider samsara and nirvana as opposite poles, where samsaraceases only with nirvana’s negation of it; in that view, the two cannot existtogether, as one is effectively the negation of the other.In the universal way, beings and their worlds are seen in the light of theirabsence of true existence, or emptiness. This emptiness is not an entity tobe found outside phenomena themselves. For this reason, the famous sutraThe Heart of Wisdom states:Form is empty; emptiness is also form. Emptiness is no other thanform; form is no other than emptiness.In this view, it is not difficult to see a shift, though only theoretical, fromthe basic understanding of samsara and nirvana. Here, form, or samsara,and emptiness, nirvana, are not mutually exclusive but complementary.Nirvana is achieved not by negating samsara but by understanding its realnature. For that reason, in the literature of transcendent wisdom (shes rabkyi pha rol tu phyin pa, prajì›p›ramit›), emptiness is also called “natural"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000227nirvana” (rang bzhin gyis myang ’das). A nirvana that is something otherthan the ultimate nature of samsara does not exist. However, at the stage oftreading the path to awakening, nirvana and samsara remain for thebodhisattva very different.It is only in tantra that the theoretical assertion that samsara and nirvanaare an essential identity bears important practical implications. The personand the environment are already nirvana. However, they appear as samsarabecause one’s own true condition is not recognized. To rediscover the awak-ened condition of one’s inner and outer dimensions, one familiarizes withthe identity of samsara and nirvana, not only in their natures but also intheir aspects.The practitioner actualizes the identity of samsara and nirvana by realiz-ing that the aggregates (of forms, feelings, discriminations, compositionalfactors, and consciousnesses) are the buddhas of the five families (Vairochana,Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, and Akshobhya) and the el-emental properties (earth, water, fire, wind, and space) are their consorts(Lochana, Mamaki, Pandara, Tara, and Dhatvishvari). The sense conscious-nesses, sense powers, and all other faculties and their activities, and so forth,are understood to be the natures of enlightened deities. Body, speech, andmind are seen as the great mandala of divine energy, the very nature thatpervades all existence.THE INNATE AS GREAT BLISSAs pointed out in Kongtrul’s Topical Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra, theword “innate” (lhan skyes, sahaja) has different meanings when distinguishedin terms of the ground, path, and result. At the time of the ground, theinnate refers to original pure and perfect mind (bodhicitta) which is beyondthe grasp of the conceptual mind, the “lord” pervading the totality of cyclicexistence and perfect peace, the ground or essence of all. This meaning isindicated in the following words from the tantras: From “me,” all beings arise.and:That is the life-force of all creatures. At the time of the path, from a general perspective, the innate refers tothe view that understands the absence of intrinsic nature of phenomena,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAwhich are beyond arising, abiding, and cessation, to be the inseparability ofemptiness and luminous clarity. In this specific tantric context, the innatedenotes the experience of bliss that occurs when winds dissolve in the cen-tral channel brought about by such practices as inner heat or union with aconsort.At the time of the result, the innate is that very innate of the ground,which, through the strength of being contemplated on the path, becomesthe great innate free from obscurations and endowed with the two purities(dag pa gnyis ldan), intrinsic purity and purity from adventitious stains.From another perspective, but still pointing to the same reality, theinnate means both the natural condition (rang bzhin lhan skyes) of every-thing and the innate as bliss from the melting of vital essence (zhu bdelhan skyes). Both of these types of innate are known as bliss (bde ba, sukha).The natural condition of everything encompasses the innate of the ground,path, and result. It is the very nature of the animate and inanimate. Theinnate as bliss arising from the melting of vital essence relates specificallyto the path.How is the innate as bliss manifested in the path? During ordinary sexualunion, the male and female experience physical and mental pleasure pro-duced by the melting and release of vital essence. This is common sexualbliss. In tantra, this experience of bliss itself is used as the basis of a specialtechnique: the practitioner causes the melted vital essence to flow through-out all channels of the body, producing physical and mental bliss. Withbliss serving as the secondary condition and the practitioner’s familiaritywith the innate pristine awareness nature of the mind as the primary cause,winds and mind dissolve in the central channel. Thus stimulated, the vitalessence present in the central channel melts and conceptions cease, allow-ing to manifest limpid, nonconceptual, pristine awareness, accompanied bythe experience of the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness.When innate bliss is still attended by the dualistic impression of empti-ness as the object and bliss as the subject, it is known as example innate bliss(dpe’i lhan skyes kyi bde ba). When it is nonconceptual pristine awareness ofthe very nature of reality, resembling a clear sky, free from even the mostsubtle subject-object duality, it is known as real or actual innate bliss (dongyi lhan skyes kyi bde ba). The same kind of distinction is drawn betweenactual luminous clarity (don gyi ’od gsal) and example luminous clarity (dpe’i’od gsal). In the experiential process, and according to the phases in whichthe innate is manifested through tantric methods, the innate as bliss is un-derstood as the pristine awareness of the four joys."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000229Being emptiness beyond any definition, how can the innate natural con-dition of everything be called bliss? It is known as bliss for a number ofreasons: the innate is free from the concepts of arising, abiding, and ceasing;it does not abide in either cyclic existence or perfect peace; it is free fromadherence to self and others; it is the pristine awareness of one’s intrinsicawareness, an awareness that cognizes its own nature; it pervades every-thing; and it is always of the nature of bliss, whatever the circumstances.Furthermore, the innate reality that derives from the melting of vital es-sence is spoken of as “great bliss” because it is totally free from all sufferingand adherence to subject-object duality (gzung ’dzin). It is not the taintedpleasure experienced by ordinary persons but is manifested by “striking thecrucial points of the body” (lus kyi gnad du bsnun pa) through the methodof inner heat (gtum mo, caòç›l¦) or in union with a consort. This indicatesthat this reality is found within the “temple” of one’s body. Accordingly, thetantras state:This is the great pristine awarenessWhich abides in the bodies of all.All highest yoga tantras, with different degrees of emphasis, teach that reli-ance on the method of union with a qualified consort is an indispensablestep in the path to realization. In systems that present instructions not de-pendent on the tantric way of transformation, such as Gampopa’s great seal(phyag rgya chen po, mah›mudr›) approach and the great perfection (rdzogschen), that method (which certainly involves risks) is considered helpful butnot absolutely necessary or superior to other methods since the reality ofthe innate is penetrated directly without the preliminary step of experienceof the example bliss.BODHICHITTA AND THE FOUR JOYSBodhichitta (byang chub sems, bodhicitta), a term used in both the sutras andtantras, carries several distinct but related meanings. In the context of theway of the bodhisattva, where bodhichitta represents the central principle,bodhi means awakening, and chitta, mind or spirit, and the term is there-fore translated as “mind of awakening” in the sense of mind directed towardenlightenment. As pointed out in the transcendent wisdom discourses,bodhichitta can be relative or ultimate depending on its focus. The relativeawakening mind focuses on sentient beings and is defined as the altruistic"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAresolve to awaken and the actual venturing toward that goal. It springs fromlove and compassion and serves as the entrance to the universal way. Ulti-mate awakening mind consists in the direct and nonconceptual understand-ing of reality born from contemplation and gained at the first stage ofawakening of the bodhisattva. Bodhichitta, in its twofold aspect, serves asthe seed or potential that blossoms into the awakened state.In the tantras as well, bodhichitta is understood on both relative andultimate levels. On the relative level, the term is used not only to denoteawakening mind as understood in the universal way, but also to refer toseminal essence, the seed or support of great bliss. Ultimate bodhichitta, orultimate awakening mind, means nonconceptual understanding of realityas well as great bliss born from seminal essence. This is clearly stated in theHevajra Tantra:The relative jasmine-flower-like seminal essenceIs the embodiment of bliss, the ultimate.To symbolize the main deity, the indivisible single reality, and the way blissarises, relative bodhichitta is referred to as semen (khu ba, Ÿukra), its mascu-line and obvious form. Since it serves as the seed of great bliss, it is alsotermed vital essence (thig le, tilaka). When pointing out its energetic func-tion, it is called “constituent” (khams, dh›tu), “constituent of bodhichitta”(khams byang chub kyi sems), or simply “bodhichitta.” In order to differenti-ate it from contexts in which the innate and other elements are called vitalessence, relative bodhichitta is defined as the “inner substantial vital es-sence” (nang gi rdzas kyi thig le), meaning that it is contained in the body.When reality is understood in terms of method and wisdom, in eitherthe nirvanic manifestation as the male and female deity or the samsaricmanifestation of subject-object duality, relative bodhichitta is distinguishedaccording to its two aspects of the masculine and the feminine. These arecalled, respectively, white vital essence and red vital essence (thig le dkardmar); white component (dkar cha) and red component (dmar cha); or lu-nar constituent (zla ba’i khams) and solar constituent (nyi ma’i khams). Be-cause these are pairs originating from one single reality, the term “semen”(khu ba, Ÿukra) in some contexts refers to both white and red essences.According to tantra, in an embodied existence, the white vital essenceoriginates from the semen (khu ba) of the father, and the red vital essence,from the ovum (khrag) of the mother, which have merged at the time ofsexual intercourse to form the physical basis for the consciousness of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000231intermediate being conceived in their midst. Throughout fetal development,these essences remain at the navel, the energy-center from where the bodydevelops. At birth, they separate; the white settles at the head, and the red,four fingers below the navel. These are the original vital essences, represent-ing method (great bliss) and wisdom (emptiness), respectively. They alwaysremain at those physical places as supports for life, until death disruptsthem.The sub-product of the original white vital essence moves downwardsthrough the net of channels of the left side of the body, while the sub-product of the original red vital essence, which has the nature of blood,moves upward through the net of channels of the right side of the body.These nourish the psychophysical complex, maintaining strength and well-being. Their residues are expelled in coarse forms through the pores of theskin and other orifices.It is evident that such a description is a blend of coarse and subtle physi-ology. In fact, although the vital essences are said to be the sub-products ofthe original ones, at the same time, they are said to be a result of the seven-fold process of regeneration of the body spoken of in Ayurveda and Tibetanmedicine, which begins with the ingestion of food. In this process, the nu-trient of food turns into blood, blood turns into flesh, flesh into fat, fat intobones, bones into marrow, and marrow into reproductive fluid. A part ofthe reproductive fluid flows to the heart from where, through the variouschannels, it reaches all parts of the body, providing them with necessarysustenance. Another part becomes semen in men and ovum in women.In this context, the tantras speak of “semen” (khu ba, Ÿukra) and “blood”(khrag, rakta). Some have taken “blood” to mean menstrual blood. How-ever, the coarse form of what the tantras call “blood,” unlike menstrualblood, must have reproductive functions just like its male counterpart, se-men. Therefore, “blood” should be understood as ovum. The subtle formsreferred to by the term “blood” consist in the original and derivative redvital essences mentioned above.The subtle vital essences are present in both males and females, but thewhite is predominant in the male; the red, in the female. They pervade andabide in all parts of the body, the white being mainly in the channel-wheel(cakra) of the head; the red, mainly in the channel-wheel of the genitals andthat of the navel.The great Tibetan yogin Gyalwa Yang-gönpa (1213-1258), who is saidto have had a vision of the secret functioning and structure of the body,explains that these vital essences are subject to daily, monthly, yearly, and"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAlife cycles (’phel ’grib). These cycles influence, sometimes positively and some-times negatively, the physical functions and emotional reactivity of humans.The cycles that most clearly represent the patterns of vital essences are thedaily, monthly, and yearly cycles since these correspond to the movementsof the sun and moon.Corresponding to the cycle of a day, determined by the rising and settingof the sun, the red vital essence increases with the rising of the sun anddecreases with its setting. The opposite is true for the white vital essence.Corresponding to the cycle of a month, determined by the waxing andwaning phases of the moon, the white vital essence increases from the firstto the fifteenth of the lunar month and then decreases from the sixteenth tothe thirtieth, while the red vital essence decreases from the first to the fif-teenth and increases during the waning phase of the moon. In this cycle,the past aspect, when the essence has fully completed its function and hasbecome residual, is said to be the “dissolved” vital essence. The present as-pect, the refined essence (principally the white aspect) currently perform-ing its function, is the “engaged.” The future aspect, the cause or root ofboth the refined and the residual, is the “dominant” vital essence.Corresponding to the cycle of a year, determined by what appears as themovement of the sun toward the north for six months and toward the southfor six months, the white vital essence increases for six months beginningfrom the summer solstice and then decreases as the red vital essence in-creases for six months beginning from the winter solstice.Although both cycles are necessary and complementary, generally speak-ing the cycle of increase of the white vital essence is one of growth andtherefore has a positive influence on the human body and mind complex,while the cycle of increase of the red vital essence is one of decline and has adetrimental influence, with body and mind susceptible to obstacles.Vital essences are also distinguished as the vital essences of body (lus,k›ya), speech (ngag, v›k), mind (sems, citta), and pristine awareness (yeshes, jì›na), each of which has its particular location in the body, princi-pally the head, throat, heart, and navel. Imprints that are the source ofemotional and cognitive obscurations, accumulated since beginninglesstime, are present within these essences as a subtle union of wind andmind. Thus, in the ordinary state of unawareness, these four types of vitalessences give rise to the four states of an individual: the waking or ordi-nary state (tha mal), deep sleep (gnyid mthug), dream (rmi lam), andsexual union (snyoms ’jug), respectively, together with the deceptions thatare related to these states."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000233In order to purify the four vital essences, the practitioner trains in fourmethods, involving the generation of various forms, the creation of sounds,nonconceptual contemplation, and use of sexual bliss. At the time of thepath, the experiences from these methods arise as the vision of empty forms(stong gzugs), invincible sound (gzhom med sgra), nonconceptual conscious-ness (mi rtog pa’i shes pa), and immutable bliss (mi ’gyur ba’i bde ba), respec-tively. As the ultimate effects of these methods, the waking state transformsinto the various manifestations of awakening (nirm›òak›ya); the dream statetransforms into the enjoyment dimension (sambhogak›ya), inclusive of allawakened bodies and voices; sleep transforms into the nonconceptual di-mension of reality (dharmak›ya), awakened mind, free from all limitationsimposed by mental constructs; and sexual bliss transforms into the dimen-sion of great immutable bliss (mah›sukhak›ya). These vital essences are thuspossessed of a double potency: unpurified, they bind one to illusion; puri-fied, they grant freedom from illusion. This system of purification of vitalessences and the four states is expounded in the Kalachakra tantra.There are, moreover, other means to purify the four vital essences ac-cording to the various tantras. These include esoteric instructions on theyoga of illusory body (sgyu lus, m›y›deha) to purify the waking state; theyoga of luminous clarity (’od gsal gyi rnal ’byor, prabh›svara yoga) to purifysleep; dream yoga (rmi lam gyi rnal ’byor, svapna yoga) to purify dream; andinner heat (gtum mo, caòç›l¦) to purify the experience of orgasm. Alterna-tively, purification is effected by means of the four seals (phyag rgya, mudr›):the doctrine seal (chos kyi phyag rgya, dharmamudr›), great seal (phyag rgyachen po, mah›mudr›), pristine awareness seal (ye shes phyag rgya, jì›namudr›),and action seal (las kyi phyag rgya, karmamudr›), respectively.Central to all tantric methods is the experience of the “four joys” (dga’ba, ›nanda). In the course of practice, the white vital essence situated at thehead is intentionally melted in order to experience bliss. This process in-volves activating the energy of the red vital essence at the navel and causingit to blaze using breath control techniques and other means. Given the lightnature of the elemental property of which it is composed (i.e., fire), the heatenergy of the red essence moves upward, warming the cold nature of thewhite essence. The white essence melts and drips, a process in which thevital essence becomes increasingly fluid as it reaches the reproductive or-gans. Given the heavy nature of the elemental properties of which the whiteessence is composed (i.e., earth and water), this vital essence moves down-ward. Since the original vital essences remain at the head and below thenavel until death, the blaze of the red essence and the dripping of the white"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAmust refer to an acceleration of the energetic process mentioned above, inwhich the sub-products of these ascend and descend in the body.The descent of the white vital essence is marked by four main stages ofexperience known as “joys.” Each of the four joys arises in turn as moltenwhite vital essence reaches the channel-wheels (rtsa ’khor, cakra), or centersof energy, along the central channel. Since the tantras differ in their enu-merations of channel-wheels, some asserting four, others six, the points inthe descent of vital essence where the joys occur are posited differently. According to the Kalachakra system, as the stream of white “nectar”from the upper part of the head reaches the throat, there occurs the initialjoy (dang po’i dga’ ba, pratham›nanda). As it reaches the heart, there arisesthe supreme joy (mchog dga’, param›nanda). As it reaches the navel, thereoccurs the special joy (khyad dga’, viram›nanda). As it reaches the tip of thepenis, there occurs the innate joy (lhan cig skyes pa’i dga’ ba, sahaj›nanda). Intantras such as the Hevajra that postulate four channel-wheels, this last joyoccurs at the navel.The initial joy is a slight experience of bliss. Supreme joy is that first joyincreased so that it overcomes the coarse levels of the conceptual mind. Thespecial joy, which in the Hevajra is known as joy of separation (dga’ bral), isthe experience of bliss and emptiness becoming inseparable. As a result ofthis, attachment to the joy ceases and the limitation of passion is overcome.The innate joy is the nondeceptive, concept-free realization of the indivis-ibility of bliss and emptiness.Innate bliss is the very nature of ordinary consciousness but remainshidden until discovered through those powerful experiences. In order torecognize this nature and stabilize one’s awareness of it, it is necessary forthe tantric practitioner to withhold semen, the base of bliss. For this reason,great emphasis is placed on relative bodhichitta in the tantric path of trans-formation, and several pledges are concerned with not allowing it to bereleased.2THE INDESTRUCTIBLE BODYThe tantras assert that all phenomena are the very essence of the deity (lha,deva), and have always been since beginningless time. What is meant here isthe “real” deity, pristine awareness (ye shes, jì›na) permeated by bliss, themind nature of every individual. The dimension (sku, k›ya) of such aware-ness is its innate glow (rang mdangs). In the mother tantras, the glow ofpristine awareness is said to be present as two very subtle aspects known"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000235metaphorically as white semen (khu ba, Ÿukra) and red essence or “blood”(rdul, rajas).It is on the basis of these two aspects that bliss arises. Coemergent withbliss is non-recognition of it as pristine awareness. When the pristine aware-ness of bliss is not recognized, the two subtle aspects of its glow take oncoarser aspects. The red aspect transforms into the appearances of cyclicexistence; and the white, into the perceiver, or mind apprehending them:this constitutes the duality of subject and object.In describing the two aspects and the state of non-recognition, tantrasuse the terminology of the three qualities (yon tan, guòa) of the “universalsubstance” (spyi gtso bo, prak ̧t¦) postulated in the Hindu samkhya philoso-phy, from which all knowables arise as transformations (rnam ’gyur) of thethree. Accordingly, the red aspect is called motility (or creativity) (rdul,rajas); the white aspect, buoyancy (or lightness) (snying stobs, sattva); andnon-recognition, darkness (or immobility) (mun pa, tamas). In the impurestate of non-recognition of pristine awareness, these three qualities manifestas the body, speech, and mind of an ordinary individual. In the pure state ofawakening, they manifest as the body (sku), speech (gsung), and mind (thugs)of a buddha.In the world of light postulated by the father tantra, deviation from one’sground of being and entering into duality occurs owing to a shift fromsubtle light, which is the primordial nature of mind known as total empty(thams cad stong pa) or luminous clarity (’od gsal, prabhasvara). The shiftmanifests as three coarser phases of light, namely culmination of light (snangba thob pa, ›lokapalabdi), increase of light (snang ba mched pa, ›lok›bh›sa),and light (snang ba, ›loka). Alternative designations for the three lights aregreat empty (stong pa chen po, mah›Ÿánya), very empty (shin tu stong pa,atiŸánya), and empty (stong pa, Ÿánya).The three lights, which manifest as black, red, and white radiances, re-spectively, are known collectively as consciousness (rnam par shes pa, vijì›na).Specifically, the black radiance is associated with ignorance (ma rig pa, avidy›),the red, with compositional factors (’du byed, saôsk›ra), and the white,with consciousness (rnam shes, vijì›na), which in the sutra tradition formthe first three links of dependent origination from which arise names andforms (ming gzugs, n›ma-rápa), the psychophysical aggregates of the personwhich represent the phenomenal world. In the idealist terminology used bysome commentators on the tantras and adhered to by Kongtrul, these threeare posited as the ground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes), afflictedsubjective mind (nyon yid), and sense consciousnesses (dbang shes)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThus, from the lights arise the apprehender and the apprehended, alongwith the conceptions and coarse elements, the principal of which is called“wind” (rlung, v›yu). According to tantra, this last, wind, is the actual ele-ment that instigates the creation of everything. Whenever the three phasesof light occur in order of progressive coarseness (i.e., culmination of light,increase of light, and light), conditioned involvement in the duality of sub-ject and object takes place. According to the tradition of oral esoteric in-structions, these three lights occur whenever there is the appearance of anobject.Similar to the path to liberation through reversal of the twelve links ofdependent origination as explained in the sutras, the occurrence of the threelights in the reverse order (light, increase of light, and culmination of light)leads to the luminous clarity of reality. This process can occur naturally, asat the time of death, when all the psychophysical constituents of the persondissolve, or can be induced through tantric methods as described brieflyabove. Whether the arising of the fourth light, luminous clarity, becomes aliberating experience or not depends on the practitioner’s ability first torecognize and then to abide uninterruptedly in it.A being who is subject to confusion enters embodied existence in one ofthe three realms. In terms of tantric practice, the best of births is as a hu-man. The human body is known in tantra as the “vajra body” (rdo rje lus,vajradeha), or indestructible body. In the view of Marpa, a forefather of theKagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, it is so named because it is a body ofbliss and emptiness. Moreover, its birth is that of a truly awakened being,occurring through the five awakenings, namely, semen, ovum, conscious-ness of the intermediate being, merging of these, and formation of the hu-man body. These correspond to the five awakenings through which thedeity is created in the phase of generation, as well as the five awakenings ofthe phase of completion, and the five awakenings that precede the momentof awakening for every individual who becomes a buddha. Thus, the beingis already awakened at birth in having been born from the five awakenings.According to other masters, the human body is indestructible because itscomponents, the aggregates and so forth, are indivisible from the those ofenlightenment. It is also called the “vajra body endowed with six constitu-ents,” the six being the four elemental properties of earth, water, fire, wind,plus the white vital essence (pristine awareness) and red vital essence (emp-tiness).The indestructible body is composed of the triad of channels (rtsa, n›ç ¦),winds (rlung, v›yu), and vital essences (thig le, bindu), which represents"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000237body, speech, and mind, the three categories under which all existence issubsumed. The channels, the very nature of the body, are the stable compo-nents of the indestructible body, likened to a house; the vital essences, thesupport for the mind, as elements situated within the channels, are likenedto riches (contained in the house); and the winds, the moving elements, arelikened to the owners of the riches.There are three main channels, the left, right, and central channels, whosefunctions are of primary importance and whose positions within the bodyreflect the principles of method, wisdom, and nonduality. They are gener-ally described as extending from the lower part of the body to the head andthen bending toward the nostrils and the point between the eyebrows. Thepositions of their lower and upper extremities are explained differently de-pending on the tantra.The left channel, in Sanskrit lalan› (rkyang ma), originates from thepower of the white aspect of the glow of pristine awareness. It creates theillusion of an apprehender. Lalana is also called “wisdom” (shes rab, prajì›)because it causes the lunar wind (zla ba’i rlung) to flow from the left nos-tril. Its lower extremity controls emission and retention of urine. Four-teen channels branch off from the lalana, spreading throughout the leftside of the body.The right channel, in Sanskrit rasan› (ro ma), originates from the powerof the red aspect of the glow of pristine awareness. It creates the illusion ofan objective world, the apprehended. Rasana is also called “method” (thabs,up›ya) because it causes the solar wind (nyi ma’i rlung) to flow from theright nostril. Its lower extremity controls emission and retention of feces.Ten channels branch off from the rasana, spreading throughout the rightside of the body.The central channel, in Sanskrit m›dhyama (rtsa dbu ma), also referredto as avadháti, originates from the power of wind. It is known as “central,”or “all-abandoning” (kun spangs ma), because it has rejected the “extremes”of both the lunar and solar winds, and because when the winds that flow inthe right and left channels enter and dissolve in the central channel, theconcepts of subject and object are overcome. Five channels branch off fromthe central channel at the heart area to reach the senses and control theirfunctions. Its lower extremity, known as “conch-shell” (dung can ma, Ÿaºkin¦),controls the emission and retention of semen.The thirty-two channels (including the three principal channels) are themajor pathways for the winds and vital essences and correspond to the thirty-two outer sacred places spoken of in tantra. Altogether, the channels of the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAbody are said to number 72,000, equal to the number of rivers of the In-dian subcontinent, or millions when the very fine ones are counted.According to the Hevajra system, at the places where these three chan-nels meet, namely, navel, heart, throat, and head, there originate the “pet-als” or spokes of the four chakras or “wheels.” The yellow channel-wheel atthe navel, comprising sixty-four channels, is known as the “channel-wheelof emanation” (sprul ba’i ’khor lo, nirm›òacakra) because the formation ofthe body in the womb begins there. It is called “wheel” because by generat-ing the inner heat at the navel, deception related to the waking state is“crushed” as if under a wheel.The blue channel-wheel at the heart, comprising eight channels, is knownas the “channel-wheel of phenomena” (chos kyi ’khor lo, dharmacakra) be-cause it serves as the base for the mind of the reality dimension of awaken-ing. It is called “wheel” because by contemplating luminous clarity at theheart, deception related to deep sleep is crushed.The red channel-wheel at the throat, comprising sixteen channels, isknown as the “channel-wheel of enjoyment” (longs spyod kyi ’khor lo,sambhogacakra) because it serves as the base for the experience of tastes. It iscalled “wheel” because through dream yoga connected to that place, thedeception of dreams is crushed.The white channel-wheel at the head, comprising thirty-two channels, iscalled “channel-wheel of great bliss” (bde chen gyi ’khor lo, mah›sukhacakra)because it serves as the base for the experience of great bliss. It is called“wheel” because by stabilizing the vital essence at the head, deception asso-ciated with orgasm is crushed. There are various assertions concerning these channels. In his Oral Trans-mission of the Ancestors (Mes po zhal lung), a commentary on the Four Medi-cal Tantras (gSo rig rgyud bzhi), the outstanding Zurkar Lodrö Gyalpo3(1509-1585), with the twofold expertise of a mystic and doctor of Tibetanmedicine, seems to suggest that the left channel corresponds to the spinalcolumn, which in Tibetan medicine is known as “white channel of life”(srog rtsa dkar po); the right channel, to the vena cava, or “red channel oflife” (srog rtsa dmar po); and the central channel, to the aorta or “blackchannel of life” (srog rtsa nag po). These channels are indeed closely con-nected to the vascular and nervous systems, as well as to other componentsof the psychophysical complex. Therefore, meditating on the channels caninduce special experiences determined by subtle changes in body and mind.However, these three channels do not physically exist in the body; they are"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000239visualized in various ways in the course of different tantric practices and fordifferent purposes.The indivisible nature of mind is said to possess a “mobile quality.” Thismobile quality is described as currents of energy which flow through the chan-nels of various parts of the body, presiding over physical as well as mentalfunctions, and pass through the nostrils as breathing. Such currents of energy,called “winds” (rlung, v›yu), serve as the bridge between body and mind.The winds are a blend of two types of energy, one associated with emo-tionality, called karmic or conditioned wind (las kyi rlung), and the otherrelated to the original state of the individual, called pristine awareness wind(ye shes kyi rlung). Distinguished in terms of the three principles, darkness(tamas), motility (rajas), and buoyancy (sattva), winds are of three types:wind of Rahu, solar wind, and lunar wind. Moreover, the winds are differ-entiated as the five root winds (rtsa ba’i rlung), the natures of the five ele-ments, and five branch winds (yan lag gi rlung), produced through the fiveelemental transformations. The winds of the five elements, or five mandalas,flow back and forth through the right and left nostrils in the order of genera-tion of the elements and of birth (first space, then wind, fire, water, earth) andin the order of dissolution of the elements and of death (first earth, thenwater, and so on), respectively. In one day, they are exhaled and inhaled 21,600times, divided between the two nostrils, a time corresponding to eight peri-ods or watches (thun). The outward movement of these energy currents as thebreath diminishes the strength of the wind associated with pristine awareness.Therefore, when outward movement increases, there occur signs of death. Ifthe winds are held inside, pristine awareness wind is strengthened. Hence,many extraordinary powers such as longevity are gained through breath con-trol techniques for “holding the winds” in the central channel.The third element in the triad of channels, winds, and vital essences hasbeen introduced previously as relative bodhichitta. All channels, winds, andvital essences manifest from pristine awareness, the nature of mind. Essen-tially beyond the duality of subject and object, they represent the authenticcondition of the body. Therefore, through contemplations that strike theircrucial points (as mentioned above), much in the same way a doctor strik-ing with his small rubber hammer the right point on the knee causes areflex reaction in the leg, one can manifest the pristine awareness of intrin-sic awareness (rang rig pa’i ye shes), an awareness that cognizes its own na-ture, one’s primordial condition, the same reality from which arise thechannels, winds, and vital essences."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAKONGTRUL’S PRESENTATION OF TANTRIC SYSTEMSIn Systems of Buddhist Tantra: The Indestructible Way of Secret Mantra,Kongtrul begins (in chapter one of the translation) by providing differentperspectives on the placement of secret mantra in the Buddhist collectionsof teachings. He refers to different tantras and to the commentaries of emi-nent Indian and Tibetan scholars, some of whom assign the tantras to thethree collections (sde snod gsum, tripiîaka), and others, to a fourth collectionknown as the “awareness-holder collections” (rig pa ’dzin pa’i sde snod,vidy›dhara-piîaka). Following that, taking a somewhat epistemological ap-proach, Kongtrul defines the nature of tantra and mantra and presents rea-sons for tantra’s superiority over other paths by noting the characteristicsthat distinguish tantra from the common teachings of the individual anduniversal ways.Next (chapter two), citing numerous passages from different tantras aswell as the assertions of Indian and Tibetan scholars, the author sets forththe various ways in which tantra is formally classified. From his discussion,it becomes evident that while in the Tibetan tradition tantra came to berigidly structured into four sets (in the new schools) and six sets (in theancient school), it originally comprised many interrelated practices andobservances, with no strictly defined borders separating them.Kongtrul then explains the rationale for the division of tantra into foursets, namely, action (bya ba, kriy›), conduct (spyod pa, cary›), yoga (rnal’byor, yoga), and highest yoga (rnal ’byor bla med, anuttarayoga) tantras. Thisclassification is generally accepted by the new schools and represents themain body of tantras translated into Tibetan and included in the collectioncalled the Kangyur (bKa’ ’gyur). Some of the reasons for the fourfold divi-sion of the tantras are closely related to their views and modes of practice.Another reason stems from the correlations between the four divisions andthe four views (a standard categorization of philosophical trends made inlater Indian Buddhism), namely, the analyst, traditionist, experientialist,and centrist views.In the following sections (chapters three, four, and five), starting in eachcase with a concise citation from the Compendium on the Indestructible Pris-tine Awareness Tantra (Jì›nasamuccaya), an exegetical tantra of Guhyasamaja,Kongtrul discusses the three lower tantras—action, conduct, and yoga—explaining their names, standards for initiation, views, styles of practice,and so forth."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000241Action tantra, where action means ritual activities, emphasizes outer con-duct, with special prescriptions for ceremonial modes of ablution, cleanli-ness, eating and drinking, clothing, and so forth. Such observances are basedon the notion of inferiority to the deity, who is regarded as perfection andexistent outside of oneself, and stem from ignorance or fear of the profoundtruth that everything is devoid of inherent nature. They also reflect obliga-tions to one’s social group and to a conventionally proper lifestyle. To over-come the separation between the ordinary human condition and the divine,one conforms to a way of purity in attire and behavior and visualizes thedeity in front of oneself while recollecting the emptiness of one’s own self.This is done until a vivid experience of the indivisibility of oneself and thedeity arises.Conduct tantra, where conduct encompasses both outer ritual activityand inner contemplation, involves training in a vast range of deeds whileentering the inner reality that presents itself in visual and audible divinerepresentations. The notion here is that of being close to the state of a per-fect divine being, a state not yet fully realized. This limited view is over-come by visualizing the deity outside of oneself and, as a reflection of that,visualizing oneself as the deity, understanding that form to be the appear-ance aspect of emptiness.Yoga tantra, where yoga refers to the inner union of method and wis-dom, or, from another perspective, the inseparable union of the relativedivine form and its ultimate empty nature, emphasizes contemplation ofinner reality. In this system, the practitioner places himself in the center ofa network of subjective relationships with this reality, which appears in avariety of divine features. The practitioner and the deity are viewed as abso-lutely equal. Method and wisdom are applied inseparably in contempla-tions on the indivisibility of one’s body, speech, mind, and activities andthose of the deity. These contemplations are known as the four seals (asunderstood in that system)—the great seal (mah›mudr›), the pledge seal(samayamudr›), the seal of the doctrine (dharmamudr›), and the action seal(karmamudr›)—and are to be applied with the understanding of essentialreality.In contrast to his extremely concise treatment of the lower tantras,Kongtrul provides a detailed exposition of the system of highest yoga tantra(beginning with chapter six). Citing the Compendium on the IndestructiblePristine Awareness Tantra, Kongtrul first defines the essence of highest yogatantra. Then, in order to elucidate the meaning of the tantra, he introduces"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe subject of the three continuums, namely, the continuum of cause (rgyu,hetu), the continuum of method (thabs, up›ya), and the continuum of re-sult (’bras bu, phala). This threefold format stems from the Guhyasamajabut is by no means to be understood as exclusive to that tantra. Instead, it isone that encompasses all of the content of the highest tantras in general.The next large section (chapters seven to ten) treats the causal continuum,understood principally as the luminous clarity nature of the mind of eachindividual. First is given a rather general explanation said to derive fromShantigupta, one of the latest great adepts of India, whose discipleBuddhaguptanata was a master of the Tibetan Taranata. Kongtrul then be-gins an extensive exposition of the subject based on the view of Naropa.The causal continuum, or luminous clarity, can be said to be the realitythat is neither outer nor inner but includes all that manifests as pure andimpure phenomena. Since this reality presents itself as the body and mindand is discovered by one’s own intrinsic awareness within the “temple” ofthe body, it is necessary to understand the authentic condition manifestingas mind and the authentic condition manifesting as body.To reconnect with the sutras or common teachings of the Buddha and toshow that there is indeed continuity between sutras and tantras, Kongtruldescribes at length the authentic condition of existence in its pure state,equating it with the essence of enlightenment (tath›gatagarbha). In theuncommon experiential approach of the highest tantras, that essence is de-fined as “intrinsic awareness, the nature of great bliss” (rang rig pa bde bachen po’i rang bzhin), where awareness means awareness of mind natureitself, or, in other words, “the inseparable union of e and vam” (e vam zung’jug).Evam (“thus”) is the first word in the phrase “evaô may› Ÿrutam” (“ThusI have heard”), with which many of the sutras and tantras begin. In thecontext of the ground, when the possibilities of recognizing one’s real na-ture and straying from it are both present, e represents wisdom, and vam,method, indicating that, from the very beginning, the authentic conditionof being is the inseparable union of the two aspects that encompass allexistence, emptiness and manifestation. It is because the highest yoga tantraspoint out the authentic condition as the indissoluble union of wisdom (emp-tiness) and method (manifestation) that they are known as highest yoga(union). In the language typical of the father tantras, this union is known asthe indivisibility of profound emptiness (zab) and luminosity (gsal). In thelanguage of the mother tantras, such a union is the inseparability of blissful"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000243pristine awareness and its glow, which in an embodied existence is presentas subtle lunar and solar energies.Evam therefore represents the individual’s fundamental condition, pureand liberated. When this condition is not recognized, from the solar energyof the glow of pristine awareness, there manifests a vision of the universeconceived of as an outer entity; and from the lunar energy of the glow ofpristine awareness, there manifests a perceiver of this vision conceived of asan inner entity, or “self.”Kongtrul provides a masterful explanation of how from non-recognitionof one’s intrinsic awareness of great bliss unfolds all of conditioned exist-ence, which, nonetheless, is nothing but the glow of such awareness. Ac-cording to the father tantras, the three realms—the realm of desire (’dodkhams, k›madh›tu), the realm of form (gzugs khams, rápadh›tu), and theformless realm (gzugs med khams, ›rápyadh›tu)—arise from luminous clar-ity and the three sequential phases of light. Initially, when luminous clarityis not recognized, there arise the three lights, known as the culmination oflight, increase of light, and light. These three lights become subject to andveiled by eighty conceptions or “natures” (rang bzhin, prak ̧t¦): the sevenconceptions of delusion indicative of the culmination of light; the forty ofdesire indicative of the increase of light; and the thirty-three of aversionindicative of light. From these lights arise the five elements and their deriva-tives, the five aggregates of the person. When wind, or the “mobile quality,”seizes the five sensory objects, consciousness joined with wind starts to op-erate in the conditioned world. According to the view of the mother tantras,conditioned existence arises from the experience of mundane bliss at themoment of emission of semen during sexual union. When the nature ofinnate bliss is not recognized, the three poisons—attachment, delusion, andaversion—are initiated.When visions of the three realms are taken as real, the individual takesbirth and acquires a body which, although formed through habitual ten-dencies, is at the same time the manifestation of luminous clarity: the fun-damental manifest dimension of awakening, which, once purified, becomesthe supreme manifest dimension. The eighty conceptions, as well as theexperience of innate pristine awareness, depend on the subtle physiology ofthe body. To clarify this relationship, Kongtrul presents condensed yet com-prehensive descriptions of the inner pathways (channels), energy currents(winds), and vital essences, which is followed by a discussion on the fourstates, namely, deep sleep, dream, waking, and sexual union, the focuses of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAtantric practice. These sections on the “supported body” are followed by aterse definition of the innate or original body, the “support.”Next is presented the symbolic representation of the causal continuumin the union of e and vam. First, Kongtrul explains the meaning of evam inthe context of the ground, path, and result according to the Kalachakrasystem. Here, the single reality of e, emptiness, and vam, bliss, is describedas thirty-seven elements: thirty-six comprising the aggregates, and so forth,of the person, and the thirty-seventh, the nature that pervades them, a triadof transparency, essential identity, and indivisibility.Following the section on evam is a discussion of the ten-letter Kalachakramantra as a symbol for the causal continuum, pointing out how the natureof the causal continuum is endowed with the ten-letter mantra in the modeof pristine awareness and how the mantra, as the environments and inhab-itants of cyclic existence, arises from consciousness, the transformation ofpristine awareness.The section on the method continuum (chapter eleven) begins with anextensive explanation of the meaning of initiation, the types of mandalas inwhich the initiation is performed, and the tantras entered by means of ini-tiation. It is here that a clear distinction between father and mother highestyoga tantra is made, along with the assertion that, by virtue of their natures,all highest yoga tantras are to be considered nondual tantras, possessed ofwisdom and method. Following that (chapter twelve) is a detailed descrip-tion of the initiation procedure, from the preparatory ritual of the site forthe construction of the mandala up to introduction of the student into themandala. In highest yoga tantra, the initiations are primarily four, withdifferent subdivisions. The vase initiation is considered to be a lower initia-tion, and the remaining three—the secret, the pristine awareness throughwisdom, and the word initiations—are higher. Included in these discus-sions are the particular functions and purificatory effects of the conferral ofthe four initiations.A primary purpose of the initiation in highest yoga tantra is to authorizestudents to engage in the twofold contemplation of the phase of generationand phase of completion. This subject of contemplation (chapter thirteen)is treated very briefly since it is not the main focus of this book. Kongtruldoes, however, elucidate in some depth the phase of completion from theperspective of the Heruka Galpo Tantra. The Galpo Tantra, an early transla-tion tantra of the ancient school, is one of the cycle of Vishuddha, symbolof awakened mind. One might therefore wonder why Kongtrul uses this"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000245source in elucidating the phase of completion in the context of the newschools. One reason may be that the Galpo Tantra, as asserted by DudjomRinpoché in his History of the Nyingma School, contains a phase of comple-tion that is actually of the precious oral teachings of the path and fruitiontradition transmitted in the new school of the Sakyapa. Possibly anotherreason is that the Galpo Tantra’s presentation of the phase of completion, asoutlined by Kongtrul, gives a remarkably clear picture of what that phaseentails and its salient points, which encompass the styles of completionphase practices of both the father and mother tantras.In this discussion, a distinction is made between one aspect of the phaseof completion considered to be causal since it serves the purpose of elicitingthe pristine awareness associated with bliss and one part considered result-ant since it develops from that. Comprised by the causal phase of comple-tion are practices such as self-blessing, mandala circle, and the tantric greatseal (mah›mudr›). The term “self-blessing” has different meanings depend-ing on context; here, it denotes contemplation on the subtle mind-referentwithin the central channel of the body, visualized in order to give rise tovarious experiences of bliss. The term “mandala circle” refers to the practicethat swiftly elicits the experience of pristine awareness associated with thefour joys through sexual union with a qualified consort. The practice of thegreat seal in this context entails remaining in a state of contemplation ofpristine awareness and bliss in order to bring about repeatedly the dissolu-tion of mind and wind in the central channel and experience the resultantspecial bliss. Moreover, in the practice of the great seal that directs the mindinward, bodhichitta is channeled into the central channel, and discursivethought is caused to enter luminous clarity, whereupon, in a way greatlysuperior to meditation on emptiness alone, the dualistic impressions of ap-prehended and apprehender cease. These procedures can also be explainedin terms of the four seals, namely, action seal, pledge seal, doctrine seal, andgreat seal. Kongtrul therefore lists different views that interpret the mean-ing of these four seals in different ways.In the discussion of the resultant phase of completion (chapter four-teen), we find practices referred to as “emptiness side,” “appearance side,”and “union of emptiness and appearance.” If we compare these to Nagarjuna’sfive stages of the Guhyasamaja phase of completion, they roughly corre-spond, respectively, to luminous clarity (’od gsal, prabh›svara), illusory body(sgyu lus, m›y›deha), and the state of union (zung ’jug, yuganaddha) of thesetwo. The first is said to be the direct experience of innate pristine awareness,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAbliss and emptiness; the second, the form of the deity which appears by thepower of that innate awareness; and the third, the essential identity of pris-tine awareness and the form of the deity.The direct experience of innate pristine awareness arises upon dissolu-tion of the three lights (light, increase of light, and culmination of light)and the eighty conceptions. To explain that process, Kongtrul enters into alengthy exposition of the natures and various categories of the three lightsand also points out the various states, ordinary and special, in which theyoccur. A list is provided of the eighty conceptions, which in groups ofthirty-three, forty, and seven, manifest from and are indicative of thesethree lights, respectively. These conceptions, or discursive thoughts, donot transcend the nature of bliss and pristine awareness from which theyoriginate and into which they dissolve. When this is understood fully, theconceptions themselves become the very source of freedom. The actualarising of pristine awareness, bliss-emptiness, is effected by the dissolu-tion of the lights and the conceptions through skillful methods that re-lease the “knots” of the heart channel-wheel. These methods include vajrarecitation, inner heat, and so forth, the main method being reliance on anactual consort.Following that exposition is a brief discussion of tantric application, whichcomprises activations and complementary forms of conduct. To concludethe presentation of the three continuums is a statement defining the thirdof the three continuums, the resultant continuum of inalienableness, theactualized purified state. Lastly, there is synopsis of the view, meditation,conduct, and result of the system of highest yoga tantra in general.Having thus set forth the meaning of tantra, or the content itself, Kongtrulthen presents the subject of tantra in terms of “the words that convey thatmeaning” (chapters fifteen and sixteen), beginning with an explanation ofhow the scriptures of the action, conduct, yoga, and highest yoga tantrasare classified and a survey of the tantric topics they expound. Further, theways of teaching the lower and higher tantras are discussed, with an empha-sis placed on those of the highest yoga tantra. Special mention is made ofthe “seven ornaments” and their twenty-eight subdivisions, principles ofknowledge that stem from the Compendium on the Indestructible PristineAwareness Tantra. By means of these methods of exposition, listeners areable to cognize the purpose of the tantra, be introduced to its contents bymeans of synopsis, fathom the layers of interpretation of the root tantra,appreciate the words and meanings in accordance with their intellects, andso forth. With a short section on the special exposition method in the eso-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000247teric instructions system, Kongtrul completes his discussion of the tantrasin the new tradition.In the second major portion of the book are presented the systems of theancient translation tradition (chapters seventeen to twenty). According tothat tradition, all the ways to realization, which accommodate beings ofdifferent faculties, are included in nine ways: the way of proclaimers(Ÿr›vaka), way of solitary sages (pratyekabuddha), and way of bodhisattvas(collectively, the way of characteristics); the three outer tantras, namely,action, conduct, and yoga; and the three inner tantras—mahayoga,anuyoga, and atiyoga.The first set of three is known as the “way of the sutras that leads awayfrom the source of suffering,” since it leads to liberation by forsaking ac-tions that are sources of suffering. The second set is called the “way thatresembles Vedic austerity,” since in this path the practitioner follows pre-scribed rituals of cleanliness, and so forth, emphasized in the Vedas. Thethird set is known as the “way of the dominating method.” In more ancienttexts of this tradition, the first is said to be the mundane way of devas andhuman beings, and the ways of the proclaimers and solitary sages are con-sidered to be one. In contrast to the simple fourfold division of the tantrasin the new tradition, Kongtrul begins the discussion on the ancient tradi-tion by citing scriptures that declare the ways to realization to be indeedlimitless, as limitless as the concepts of beings, while pointing out that ulti-mately there exist no path, no traveller, and no journey.Although there are interesting differences between the explanations ofaction, conduct, and yoga tantras given in the texts of the new schools andthose given in the texts of the ancient schools, these three systems are notdiscussed again at this point since their natures are essentially identical.Kongtrul’s treatment of the three inner tantras, mahayoga, anuyoga, andatiyoga, although very significant, is, regrettably, extremely concise.In the ancient tradition, all highest yoga tantras are placed in the threeseries of inner tantras of mahayoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga. Although thetantras of mahayoga, with some exceptions such as the Guhyasamaja andChandraguhyatilaka, differ from those of the new schools, their systems ofpractice, consisting of the phase of generation and the phase of completion,basically correspond to those of the new tradition’s highest yoga tantras.However, anuyoga and atiyoga are peculiar to the ancient tradition and arenot found in the new schools.Longchenpa’s statement, “Mahayoga, the father tantra... Anuyoga, themother tantra... Atiyoga, the nature of nonduality...,” shows the correlation"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAbetween the three subdivisions of the highest tantra of the new traditionand the three inner tantras of the ancient tradition. This does not mean thatthey are equivalent but indicates certain resemblances: father tantra of thenew tradition and mahayoga of the ancient both emphasize the phase ofgeneration; and mother tantra of the new tradition and anuyoga of theancient, the phase of completion. In anuyoga, however, is taught the specialprinciple of instantaneous perfection in both the phase of generation andthe phase of completion, a feature not found in mahayoga or in the tantrasof the new schools, whose application of these two phases is gradual.As for the distinctive views of the inner tantras, mahayoga asserts that allphenomena are the magical display of the simultaneity of emptiness andappearance. Anuyoga asserts that all phenomena are the creative energy ofthe indivisibility of essential reality and pristine awareness. Atiyoga assertsthat all phenomena are the very manifestation of primordial and naturallypresent pristine awareness.Kongtrul next sets forth all aspects of mahayoga or “great yoga,” begin-ning with its essence, name, and initiation, up to its result. The initiationthat is fundamental for entering the path of this tantra is that of theGuhyagarbha, or Essence of Secrets, the root scripture of this system. Theentrance to mahayoga through application of the three contemplations con-sists in the contemplation of the essential nature, whereby one remains in astate of nonconceptual contemplation, vast as the sky; the contemplationof the total vision, whereby there arises illusory compassion for all beingswho are fettered due to nescience; and the contemplation of symbols,whereby one visualizes seed-syllables, such as the syllable hum, the nature ofone’s awareness, from which divine manifestations arise. Although mahayogaasserts that all things are already in the state of enlightenment, in order tounderstand this fully, one transforms the impure karmic view into puredivine vision by way of the three contemplations.In the system of mahayoga, all phenomena are understood to be theindivisibility of the relative and ultimate truths. In particular, mahayogaspeaks of the superior ultimate truth as the ineffable state of total presence,and the superior relative truth as the creative energy of that presence mani-festing as the mandala of male and female deities. This view is approachedby way of the four understandings, namely, the axioms of the identicalcause, mode of letters, empowering energy, and direct cognizance.The first is the understanding that all phenomena share an identicalcause, or nature: all are indistinguishable in that, on the ultimate level, theyhave never being born, and on the relative level, they manifest like a magi-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000249cal illusion. This is an explanation in common with the universal way as ituses the terminology of the two truths, ultimate and relative. The under-standing through the axiom of the mode of letters is knowing, through thesystem of mantra, that everything is already in a state of enlightenment.The understanding through the axiom of empowering energy is the realiza-tion that arises from the first two understandings. The direct cognizance isthat which is based on wisdom and does not contradict the scriptures oresoteric instructions.This approach to the view is mentioned in the Guhyagarbha and ex-panded upon in Padmasambhava’s Garland of Views: A Collection of EsotericInstructions (Man ngag lta ba’i phreng ba), where the four understandingsare explained in the context of understanding the view of the great perfec-tion (rdzogs chen). In the Treasury of Key Instructions is Kongtrul’s own com-mentary on Padmasambhava’s text entitled Sunlight, which provides aninterpretation of the basic text according to the principles of the tantras ofthe new schools. Rongzom’s commentary on the Garland of Views is per-haps more direct and conforms to the approach of the ancient traditionand, in particular, to that of the great perfection system.Along with the four understandings, there are presented other approachesto the view. The axiom of the three purities, for example, establishes thatthe elements, aggregates, and consciousnesses are already in a state of en-lightenment in being the consorts, the buddhas of the five families, and thefive pristine awarenesses.Kongtrul then gives an overview of the meditation systems based on thetradition of the eight sadhanas, or “means of attainment,” of mahayoga, thefirst five of which are associated with a particular enlightened deity, and thelast three associated with mundane forces. Another aspect of meditation inmahayoga is that which accords with the tantra tradition, comprising thepath of method and the path of liberation. In the path of method (thabslam), grounded in a firm understanding of the view, one performs actionsthat normally would bind one to conditioned existence and applies oneselfto the “upper door” (steng sgo) practice of inner heat and the “lower door”(’og sgo) practice with a real consort. The path of liberation (sgrol lam) isdifferentiated according to the levels of faculties of practitioners into two,the simultaneous and the sequential. In the first, realization is gained simul-taneous with the time of initiation or with an introduction to one’s originalnature. In the sequential or gradual approach, a practitioner attains realiza-tion by applying the three characteristics, namely, the characteristic of knowl-edge or realization of the view through the four understandings mentioned"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAabove, the characteristic of application or familiarity with that view, and thecharacteristic of the result, actual awakening.Anuyoga is a method taught for those who have the capacity to con-template in the state of total presence all that is taught in the tantras, withno stages in the generation of the deity or in the completion phase. In thissystem, the practitioner, rather than meditating on either the noncon-ceptual state of ultimate reality or the mandala of the deity, contemplatesthese two simultaneously. The initiation to introduce one to this tantra isthat of the All-Unifying Pure Presence (Kun ’dus rig pa’i mdo), a peculiarityof which is that it comprises the initiations empowering one in the anuyogamethods of the nine ways. These exceptional methods give rise to theparticular experiences and certainties that come from these nine paths.The view of anuyoga is that all phenomena are primordially perfect en-lightenment, and that perfect enlightenment is the mandala of originalbodhichitta, pure and perfect mind. Crucial to this view is the understand-ing that the original pure mind is the indivisibility of three mandalas, namely,the mandala of primordial suchness, the mandala of the spontaneously per-fect nature, and the mandala of original bodhichitta. The mandala of pri-mordial suchness is the space of total emptiness, mind nature in which allthings, pure and impure, manifest. The mandala of the spontaneously per-fect nature is pristine awareness which is unceasingly present in that dimen-sion of emptiness. The mandala of original bodhichitta is great bliss, the“offspring” of the indissoluble union of the ultimate dimension of phe-nomena and pristine awareness, the two previous mandalas.In this tantra, we also find the path of method of the upper and lowerdoors, as well as the path of liberation which consists in remaining in thestate of contemplation on the natures of the three mandalas. This contem-plation can be entered by three different methods: analysis, remaining inone’s natural state, and contemplation of a deity generated all at once throughthe simple utterance of the seed-syllable or mantra.In the ancient tradition, atiyoga is considered to be the highest of allpaths. It directly releases the individual in the very state that is primordialenlightenment. Kongtrul explains that it is called “supreme yoga” becauseof being the perfection or finality of the phase of generation and comple-tion, or because it stands as the summit of all ways. That being the case,atiyoga can be understood as the final result of the other paths, or as atiyogaper se, an independent way or system, also known as “great perfection” (rdzogschen). As the final result of all paths, atiyoga is considered to be tantra, butas an independent system, it does not fit into that category since it does not"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000251incorporate the ten topics that constitute a tantric teaching. Moreover, theatiyoga system is based on the principle of self-liberation, not that of trans-formation, which is the underlying principle of all tantras. This system is entered by means of the “initiation of the creative energyof total presence” (rig pa’i rtsal dbang). This is more of an introduction thana tantric initiation: one is introduced, right from the start, to one’s realcondition. It does not need to be preceded by the first three initiations ofhighest yoga tantra (vase, secret, and pristine awareness through wisdom),nor does it need as its precondition the third initiation which reveals theexample pristine awareness.As for the view of atiyoga, Kongtrul presents first the general view ofatiyoga, followed by its distinctions. Other systems explain that when mindis bound by illusion, there is cyclic life, while when mind is free of illusionand gains understanding, there is enlightenment. This view is not shared bythe atiyoga system, which asserts that everything that exists—all phenom-ena included in cyclic life and perfect peace—has always been the totalsphere of naturally present pristine awareness. Since the stains of the af-flictions have never existed, there are no obstacles to clear away and noqualities to develop. All phenomena are perfect from the beginning in thestate of essential identity, with no need for acceptance or rejection, prohi-bitions or remedies: this view of primordial enlightenment is known asthe great perfection. The specific and subtle distinctions of that generalview correspond to the three divisions of atiyoga (mind, vast space, andesoteric instructions).Kongtrul points out that meditation in atiyoga takes three forms: Medi-tation according to the mind division is to remain in the state of total pres-ence and emptiness. Meditation in the vast space division is to remain inthe state of one’s own true nature, with no action or effort. Meditation inthe esoteric instructions division is to remain in the state of primordialfreedom, beyond renunciation and acceptance. Conduct in atiyoga is ex-plained to be spontaneous—resembling that of a madman, with no restric-tions whatsoever—born from the realization that whatever is encounteredarises as the expressive energy of one’s own true nature. The result is toarrive at the place of primordial freedom, spontaneously perfect Samanta-bhadra, present even now.The final sections in the discussion of the ancient tradition include asurvey of the various scriptures of the three inner tantras and the scripturesof the mind, vast space, and esoteric instructions divisions of the great per-fection.

Lastly, Kongtrul pointsout the way the great perfection atiyoga tantras are expounded using fiveteachings on the path for which there are examples, and one teaching onthe result—spontaneous perfection which needs not be sought, the originalbuddha—for which there is no example but can be directly pointed out asone’s natural condition.ABOUT THE TRANSLATIONThe present text—written by a most highly respected and authoritativeteacher and covering the vast range of Buddhist tantras in both the new andancient schools of Tibetan Buddhism—is one of the first of its kind to betranslated into English.The translation involved a number of difficulties. First, with languagesas different from each other as Tibetan is from English, a mechanical trans-lation from the words of one to the words of the other is just not possible.Grammatical differences, differences in how words are formed, and differ-ences in idiomatic usage make such translations stilted at best, misleadingat worst. Paraphrasing is necessary to ensure that the actual meaning of theTibetan is conveyed accurately and appropriately in readable English.Second, in Tibetan philosophical and religious texts, one word may havea range of meanings according to context and system of thought. The edu-cated Tibetan reader was aware of the different contexts and systems. TheEnglish reader, however, does not have the background or reference points.Sometimes these differences are slight and the right word in English cancarry the range. Other times, the differences in meaning are so great thatthe translator has no choice but to use different words in English if thework is to be intelligible. The reader is, in this context, dependent on theunderstanding of the translator: if the translator’s understanding is accu-rate, no meaning is lost and the text may even be enriched.Third, translations and translators also evolve. As a text is translated andretranslated, later translations are informed by the work of their predeces-sors and produce richer results. As his or her familiarity, experience, andability grow, a translator will find better words, phrases, and construc-tions to convey meaning accurately from one language to another. Suchevolution is important, as to lay out the standards a priori would result inlifeless and probably inaccurate renderings. The standards evolve sponta-neously and the quality of translation improves accordingly. In keepingwith this principle, we have changed the way we translated certain words"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000253and phrases in our earlier work. Our intention is to produce more clarity,not more confusion.Fourth, Tibetan is a cryptic language. Its written form was developedexplicitly as a vehicle for translating Indian Buddhism texts into Tibetan. Itis an extraordinary medium for expressing profound and subtle inner teach-ings in a few words. Knowledge of words and grammar are often not suffi-cient to grasp the meaning of what is being expressed because the texts wereusually supported by oral explanations and commentary. In addition, thetexts do not come with explicative notes as the reader was expected to knowor be able to refer to other texts. With the passage of time, however, boththe tradition of oral commentary and general familiarity with other textshave declined. One of the consequences of this decline is that a well-trans-lated English text with proper explicative notes may well be more compre-hensible and useful than its Tibetan counterpart.Fifth, Kongtrul is an extremely succinct writer. With his vast familiar-ity with Tibetan Buddhist literature and being able to assume familiarityin the reader, he expresses ideas with such conciseness that often only anidea of what he is saying is possible. Kongtrul’s intended meaning be-comes clear only when the original text he had in mind has been identi-fied and read. For the translator, the choice is in how cumbersome tomake the translation, either expanding the text or providing explanationin endnotes. The current translation has been augmented with copiousnotes so that the reader has the reference material and information thatthe translators used to arrive at the translation. In many cases, the refer-ence material is not yet available in English.Finally, Kongtrul does not always indicate his sources. In such situa-tions, the translators have relied on Kongtrul’s own explanations in otherbooks that he wrote, reasoning that the utilization of these resources wouldkeep the translation as close as possible to the author’s intent. For the sec-tions on the highest yoga tantra of the new schools, these include workssuch as his Commentary on the Jewel Affinity, Commentary on Rangjung Dorjé’sProfound Inner Reality, Phrase by Phrase Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra,and Topical Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra. When explanations couldnot be found in Kongtrul’s own work, we relied on texts that he has cited,including the tantras and their commentaries, as well as other commentar-ies that we have found clearer on certain points or that were simply avail-able to us. These texts are listed among the reference works at the end ofthis book. We have checked the citations as much as possible to preventerrors in their reporting."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAIn preparing this translation, two editions of the text were consulted: themodern Beijing edition in three-volume book form (Beijing: rDo rje rGyal poand Thub bstan Nyi ma, 1985) and Kyabjé Bokar Rinpoché’s personal copyof the Palpung woodblock print (dPal spungs Thub bstan Chos ’khor gling).Tibetan and Sanskrit names appear in phoneticized forms in the trans-lated text.

It was his intention that an English render-ing of the Treasury would lay the foundation for its translation into manylanguages. During the winters of 1988 and 1989 Rinpoche summoned hisstudents from several countries to gather at Bodhgaya, the site of the Buddha’sawakening, to initiate this project. He encouraged us to continue the workfull time at his main seat, Samdrup Dargyé Chöling, in Sonada, West Bengal. Following Kalu Rinpoché’s death in 1989, responsibility for the projectfell to Kyabjé Bokar Rinpoché, crown ornament of the Kagyu lineage, whorevitalized it by inviting individuals to choose particular sections of theTreasury and see them through to publication.Work on the present volume, Systems of Buddhist Tantra, began nearly adecade later. Much of the research and translation was done at KaluRinpoché’s monastery where we had access to the library’s complete edi-tions of the Kangyur and Tengyur. We travelled regularly to nearby BokarNgedhon Choekhor Ling in Mirik to study the entire text with the elucida-tion of Kyabjé Bokar Rinpoché and Khenpo Lodrö Dönyö. Despite theirnumerous commitments, these teachers gave generously of their time, tire-lessly sharing their knowledge as well as the written commentaries fromtheir personal libraries. Moreover, in the fall of 1998 in the auspicious placeof Tso Pema (Mandi), Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoché, one of the great-est living masters of the great perfection teachings, gave one of the transla-tors a word-by-word explanation of the Nyingma tantra section of the text.We also received clarification on several obscure points from DodrupchenRinpoché in Gangtok, Sikkim and from Denma Lochö Rinpoché inDharamsala, Himachal Pradesh."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION\u000255The completion of this complex work would not have been possiblewithout the help of these great masters and scholars.We would like to express our appreciation to others who contributed tothis book: Adriano Clemente and Jim Valby, who offered valuable sugges-tions on a number of passages in the Nyingma section; Lama Karma Thinley,Ken McLeod, and Paul Fanning, who have benefited the project each in avery different and substantial way; and our editor Susan Kyser, to whom wewish to give special acknowledgment for her painstaking work on the finalmanuscript.

Of the differentways that do include it within the three collections, some place it solely inthe sutra collection;3 others, in all [three].The omniscient Rangjung Dorjé4 [as stated in his Profound Inner Real-ity] considers the collection of teachings of the awareness-holders5 [to be-long to] the three collections equally because it reveals in equal proportionsthe inner forms of discipline, discourses, and phenomenology.6 Similarly,the master Shraddhakaravarman [in his Short Guide to the Meaning of High-est Yoga Tantra] states:7An alternative position holds that the collection of teachingsof the way of secret mantra is included in equal proportionswithin the three collections of Buddhist teachings. The ratio-nale for this assertion is as follows: the nine branches of the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF TANTRA\u000273Buddha’s words8 constitute the collection of teachings of theuniversal way (mahayana); the collection of teachings of thesecret mantra way is itself included within these nine branchesand teaches the three trainings [of ethics, contemplation, andwisdom]. Hence, it is considered [to belong to] the threecollections.In addition, Abhayakara’s view accords with this explanation for the teach-ings of the indestructible way being included equally in the three collec-tions of teachings.Another perspective is found in the Dialogue with Subahu Tantra:9In order to benefit gods, demi-gods, and humans,Various types of secret and awareness mantras,Thirty million in number, plus five hundred thousand,Were declared by the Buddha to be the awareness-holdercollection of teachings. On this point, Shraddhakaravarman states:10It is asserted that the collection of teachings of the secret mantraway does not belong to those of the three ways [of the proclaimers,solitary sages, and bodhisattvas]. Instead, it is known as the aware-ness-holder collection of teachings and is another bodhisattva col-lection. As is said,Uphold in its entirety the sacred doctrine of the three ways[to realization]:The outer way, the inner way, and the secret way.11Furthermore, the master Buddhaguhya [in his Extensive Commentary on theVajravidarana Tantra] states:12The doctrine taught by the supreme BuddhaForms four collections: discourses, discipline,Phenomenology, and the awareness-holder teachings.Thus, secret mantra is considered to be a fourth collection, that of the aware-ness-holder.

This represents the perspec-tive of the common way [i.e., the individual way]. However, in [the contextof ] the universal way, that is not necessarily so, as stated in Chandrakirti’sSeventy Verses on the [Triple] Refuge:16According to the viewpoint of the proclaimersThere are three collections of teachings.In the context of the bodhisattvas’ [doctrine],This is not necessarily the case.and:17From the perspective of the bodhisattvasThere are seven collections of teachings:The bodhisattvas’ collection of teachings,The collection of the awareness-holders,18The discourses, phenomenology, discipline,Extensive teachings, and stories of the Buddha’s previous lives.These seven collections of teachings...Thus, the mantra collection of teachings is asserted to be a separate collection.THE MAIN DISCUSSION:THE [NEW] TRADITION OF SECRET MANTRA [B]This discussion consists of two parts: a general statement; and the detaileddiscussion.A GENERAL STATEMENT [1]The meaning of this way is epitomized in these three:The nature of tantra, forms of meditation, and the methods ofexposition of tantric scriptures.The indestructible way is of vast and profound meaning and is thereforelimitless in scope.

In addition, tantra denotes that which expresses it, that is, the collec-tion of the words of the Buddha that expounds the meaning of the mantra[way], referred to by the name “tantra collection of teachings of the inde-structible way.”SYNONYMS FOR TANTRA [bb]It has various names such as the mantra collection of teachingsand the way of mantra.Tantras of worldly beings are not included here.Tantra has many different names. It is called the “mantra collection of teach-ings” and the “way of mantra” since it yields powers through the use of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAmantras and mudras; and the “awareness-holder collection of teachings”since the deity, mantra, and pristine awareness of great bliss are all [of thenature of ] awareness, and it is by these profound means that awareness is“grasped.”According to an alternative perspective, tantra is the “way of the aware-ness-holder” because its collection of mantric practices leads to the attain-ment of the resultant state of awareness-holder within this same life; andthe “indestructible way” since the three indestructible states [of awakenedbody, speech, and mind] are actualized through the indestructible path ofthe indivisibility of method and wisdom.Tantra uses the causes for the attainment of full enlightenment, such asthe thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening,19 as means of cultivatingthe path. Hence, it is designated as “causal way” in terms of [the way of ]characteristics. Moreover, tantra uses on the path, right from the presenttime, the forms of the result [awakening], such as the celestial palace, dei-ties, and their sense enjoyments. Hence, it is designated as “resultant way”in terms of the mantra [way].Another perspective is this: In tantra, the emptiness endowed with thesupreme of all aspects20 serves as the cause [of immutable bliss]. This emp-tiness is the principal teaching of the way of the perfections. Hence, tantrais designated as “causal way” in terms of that way. Moreover, immutablegreat bliss abides in the nature of the result [produced by the emptinessendowed with the supreme of all aspects]. This immutable bliss is the prin-cipal teaching of the mantra way. Hence, tantra is designated as “resultantway” in terms of the mantra way.Other synonyms include the “way of method” because it has greater andmore numerous techniques than the way of the perfections; “secret way”since it must be hidden from proclaimers and others who are not suitablerecipients; and “continuum” because it is unceasingly present throughoutthe ground, path, and result.Mantras and tantras [created] by worldly beings are ordinary mantraand tantra and therefore not included here within the indestructible way, orwithin its collection of teachings.ITS NATURE [cc]Its nature is to teach principally the path of awareness mantrasand its result."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF TANTRA\u000277The nature of the way of mantra is to teach principally the path of applica-tion of awareness mantras21 and the ensuing result. Therefore, if one culti-vates the path through mantra, one must certainly do so relying on mantraand tantra application.22DIVISIONS [dd]The two categories of mantra are the mundane andsupramundane.They differ in that the first is nominal; the latter, authentic.The mundane mantra comprises what was created byordinary beings;That which leads to definite assurance, the highest states in thethree realms;And the support for the mind, the paths of accumulation andpreparation, along with their collection of teachings.Tantra in the mantra way may be divided into two general categories: themundane way and the supramundane way. These differ in that the formeris a nominal mantra way because its culmination is not a stable one; it doesnot represent definite assurance; and its time and place are ephemeral. Thelatter, the supramundane mantra, is the authentic way because it is en-dowed with characteristics opposite to those of the mundane way.Tantra of the mundane way category is of three types: the mundanemantra per se; the mantra that leads to definite assurance; and the mantrathat is the support for the mind.The first, the mundane mantra way per se, was created by Maheshvara,anchorites, gods, elemental spirits, secretive yakshas,23 mantric adepts, andother ordinary beings. This is the actual mundane way. The second is themundane mantra way that leads to definite assurance—that of the states ofawareness-holders of the desire and form realms,24 and the formless stateswhich are highest within the three realms—reached through application ofmantras. [This way] is derived from the awareness-holder collection of teach-ings. The third is the mundane way as the support for the mind [of higherpaths]25 consisting in the tantric path of accumulation and path of prepara-tion.26The latter two types belong also to the supramundane category, and allof the tantras that transmit these teachings belong to the collection of teach-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAings of the supramundane category. Even tantras created by exalted beingsthrough their own inspiration do indeed belong to the supramundane cat-egory. Those tantras are not, however, designated [part of ] the collection ofteachings of the supramundane category.DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SUTRA AND MANTRA [ii]There are three parts to this detailed analysis of the distinctions betweensutra and tantra: the viewpoints of Indian masters and an encapsulation ofthose viewpoints; division into four categories based on sutra and tantracontent; and the main distinction according to Tibetan scholars.THE VIEWPOINTS OF INDIAN MASTERS AND AN ENCAPSULATION OFTHOSE VIEWPOINTS [aa]Tantra is distinct from sutra, not in its ultimate aim, which isidentical,But in its clarity, abundance of methods, and lack of hardships.It is intended for one of sharp faculties. ...What distinguishes the mantra way from the way of sutra? Their ultimateresult or goal—dynamic perfect peace27—is identical. However, the mantraway is distinctive due to the clarity of its methods, the abundance of thesemethods, and the freedom from hardships in the practice of them.To explain, the way of mantra is one of clarity in its methods, such asmeditation on the deity and mantra recitation, which have been precededby the conferral of initiation as entrance to the [tantric] path.Mantra offers not only clear methods, but also an abundance of them,not simply one method. This is due to there being an infinity of approacheswithin the different sets of tantra— action, conduct, and so forth—appro-priate to the level of the practitioner’s faculties.The sutra way as well could be considered to have numerous methods,but it is a path that necessitates undergoing hardships such as asceticismand [the observance of ] vows and is therefore a difficult one. In contrast,the methods of the mantra way, when applied according to one’s own incli-nations, lead to the attainment of bliss by means of bliss. Thus, [mantra] issuperior in that it is a path travelled with little difficulty, free of hardship.If tantric methods are so clear, abundant, and free from hardship, whydid the Buddha not reveal [the way of mantra] to all his followers? [The"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF TANTRA\u000279answer is that] the Buddha did not teach [simply] because he possessed theknowledge, but imparted teachings suited to [the disciples’] faculties.Students who would be qualified to receive instructions on the mantraway are the sharpest of the sharp, while someone suited to being taught theway of the perfections is of low faculties compared to a practitioner of man-tra, and thus not worthy of being a student of the mantra way. In the courseof time, however, everyone without exception will qualify to be a practitio-ner of mantra, according to the logic expressed in the words of [Dharmakirti’s]Treatise on Valid Cognition, which states:28Since [the inference] is indirectly relatedTo the object....29Similarly, Tripitakamala’s Lamp of the Three Modes states:30Though the aim is identical, the way of mantraIs superior by virtue of being clear,Abundant in methods, devoid of hardships,And intended for persons of sharp faculties.31... According to the master Jnanashri,Tantra is distinguished by its eleven forms of skillful methods.Indrabhuti notes its seven special features; and Jnanapada, itspractitioner, path, and result.Shantipa states that mantra and perfections do not differ inultimate truth,But mantra has greater depth and vastness in relative truth.Most believe that the distinction lies with the subject, notobject.Other distinctions between mantra and sutra are specified by the masterJnanashri [in his Dispelling the Two Extremes in the Indestructible Way]:32Tantra is superior by virtue of its eleven forms of skillful methods:the methods that rely on unsurpassable scriptures; unsurpassablepractice; unsurpassable pristine awareness; and unsurpassable dili-gence; the power to uplift all of one’s followers; the methods tobless [transform] emotional afflictions; to swiftly impart bless-ing; to swiftly attain liberation; to overcome emotional afflictions;"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe methods of unsurpassable disposition; and unsurpassable con-duct.33Indrabhuti maintains that mantra’s distinctiveness lies in seven special fea-tures: the teacher, the recipient [of the teachings], rituals, activations, pledges,views, and conduct.34 The master Buddhajnanapada states:35The way of mantra is extraordinary in three aspects: practitioner,path, and result.Furthermore, the master Shantipa [in his Presentation of the Three Ways]states that the way of mantra and that of the perfections do not differ interms of ultimate truth. The two ways differ, however, in that the relativetruth has comparatively greater depth and vastness in the mantra way. Heexplains:36Its focus is vast in that whatever appears is meditated upon as di-vine. Its support is vast because exceptional blessing occurs whenone conscientiously upholds the pledges prescribed by the buddhasof the three times. Its conduct is vast, being modelled on the altru-istic activities of buddhas and bodhisattvas and their purificatoryblessing of realms.37The ways followed by centrists and experientialists, as well asby proclaimers and solitary sages, lack these three special featuresof focus, support, and conduct. Therefore, centrists and experi-entialists can attain awakening only after three inestimably long ae-ons; and proclaimers and solitary sages, only after four. Becausemantra does have these special features, its practitioners can attainawakening in a short time. Thus, mantra is profoundly different.On this subject, Atisha, in his Summation of Pledges, states:38Mantra is superior to all other ways, greater than even the univer-sal way. In answer to why this is so, the venerable Nagarjuna39describes seven features that distinguish it:Mantra bears the seal of Samantabhadra in that everything isunderstood to be the dimension of reality.40 It is possessed ofblessing, being made the object of veneration by the oath-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF TANTRA\u000281bound great worldly gods and their host of attendants. Itleads to the swift attainment of powers since the buddhasand bodhisattvas of the three times are aware [of the practi-tioner] and impart their blessings. It provides relief and free-dom from the perils of cyclic existence and the lower formsof life since its sphere of experience is identical to that of thejoyful ones. It allows no hindrances whatsoever since a[mantric] practitioner possesses an indestructible mind ofawakening, with body, speech, and mind being undifferen-tiated from those of a buddha. Its pledges are never violateddue to the practitioner’s conviction in the intrinsic purity ofall outer and inner phenomena. Should a violation occur,the pledge is naturally restored. These are the distinctions ofthe mantra way.As to the general distinction between the two ways, the mantra and theperfections have the same object: [emptiness] which transcends concepts.The difference lies in the subject [that apprehends emptiness]. In mantra,the subject is [the mind of ] great bliss used as method. The majority [ofIndian scholars] agree on this point. At the same time, there seem to bemany different specifications of the distinctions between the two that havebeen posited by various masters.41Its distinctiveness is encapsulated in three features: thepractitioner with three qualifications,A path with three distinctions in method, and the resultantstate of union.Any of the different specifications based on those perspectives is certainlyacceptable. The intrepid master Karma Trinlé42 and others, encapsulatingthose various viewpoints, set forth three features that distinguish mantrafrom the perfections: the individual who will be its practitioner; the path tobe travelled; and the result or goal.First, the practitioner of mantra is distinguished by three qualifications:sharpness of faculties in that he or she enters a path that swiftly yields itsresult; a mental continuum ripened by the appropriate initiation; and [con-scientiousness in] safeguarding the pledges from their root and branch down-falls. A mantra practitioner must definitely possess these three qualifications,whereas this is not required of followers of other ways."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRASecond, the path of mantra is distinguished in three ways: its methodsare abundant; they are clear; and they are free from hardships.As to the first, its abundance of methods, mantra does not dispense withany of the different methods taught in the way of the perfections, such asthe awakening mind and the six perfections. In addition to those meth-ods, mantra sets forth techniques connected to the four sets of tantra thatare far more numerous and profound than those of the perfections. Theseinclude ways to gain inconceivable powers through the various practicesof an infinite [number] of deity yogas: familiarization with, and attain-ment of, [the state of the deity], implementation of activations, methodsto elicit results if these are not forthcoming, and activities to enhancerealizations.43The second, the clarity of its methods, is due to these methods being notin the least obscure. Every aspect of practice—the object of familiarization[i.e., the deity], the practitioner of familiarization, the forms of familiariza-tion, recitation [of mantras], food offerings, fire-offering rituals, and soforth—is explained in detail and with utmost clarity.The third, freedom from hardships in [the practice of ] the methods, isbecause the mantra way produces its result within one lifetime or in just afew lifetimes while practice of the sutra way leads to accomplishment onlyafter such periods of time as three inestimably long aeons.Concerning the third feature, that of the goal or result of mantra, a di-rect result will be distinguished according to the particular quality of itsdirect cause. The culmination of the path of training in the way of theperfections gives rise to none other than the mantric path of training in themind of its practitioner.44 Therefore, the ultimate direct result of the perfec-tions is not full awakening. The culmination of all aspects of the path oftraining in the mantra way directly yields the result of full awakening. Thatbeing the case, the fully awakened state is the direct result solely of theculmination of the mantric path of training since full awakening is theultimate [state] of the path of mantra: union beyond training.45This completes Karma Trinlé’s encapsulation of the distinctions betweensutra and tantra.FOUR CATEGORIES BASED ON SUTRA AND TANTRA CONTENT [bb]Of four categories, sutra, tantra, both, and neither,The mantra collection, which uses the result in the path, isdistinguished."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF TANTRA\u000283A general classification based on sutra and tantra content yields four cat-egories: sutra, tantra, both sutra and tantra, and neither sutra nor tantra.The sutra category largely includes such texts as the increasing-by-one scrip-tures class.46 The tantra category includes the application of the garuda classof scriptures and others.47 The both-sutra-and-tantra category comprisesthe mantra collection of teachings. The neither-sutra-nor-tantra categoryincludes [treatises on] sophistic debates, and similar works.Of these, the mantra collection of teachings, known as “that which usesthe result in the path” because it applies the specialty of deity yoga, shouldalone be considered as endowed with the distinctive features explained above.This discussion on the four categories is an ancillary topic.THE MAIN DISTINCTION ACCORDING TO TIBETAN MASTERS [cc]Mantra is superior by virtue of its swiftness, which is due to fivereasons; four sources of bliss;And its skillful methods in the three trainings and all spheres ofexperience.Of all the distinctions between sutra and mantra that have been drawn byTibetan masters, whatever their number, the main ones are described in theoral teachings of the great adept Buddhagupta.48 These are expressed by thevenerable master of Jonang [Taranata] in this way:49Due to its swiftness, bliss, and skillful methods, it is said to besuperior.To expand on this, mantra is superior to sutra in swiftness. It is swift in that[through mantra], enlightenment is achieved in the time [period] of thepresent lifetime or within seven lifetimes, and so forth. Furthermore, it isswift by virtue of the following five reasons: the presence of merits acquiredthrough special [tantric] rituals whereby deities actually receive and enjoyofferings made to them;50 the creation, through the power of mantras, ofmerits equal to the grains of sand in the Ganges River through just a single“water-drop” [of practice]; the manifest [application of ] contemplationwhereby [even] beginners stop impure appearances and create pure realms;the ripening of sentient beings by means of each of the single features ofmantra or contemplation (these special reasons apply even to someone whohas merely embarked on the way of mantra); and the wisdom that, through"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe principles of both relative and ultimate truth, focuses upon the aspectof the result [of awakening], the form of which is the sphere of experienceof contemplation (these are present from the beginning until the end [ofthe mantra way]).Mantra is superior to sutra in bliss, which means the absence of anycoarse physical or mental feelings. There are four [sources of ] bliss: theattainment of a body possessed of six fortunes;51 the development of manymiraculous powers and contemplations; the buddhas’ manifest presence [nearthe practitioner] due to the power of mantras; and the fulfillment of all thewishes of beings by means of mantra and tantra application.52Mantra is superior to sutra by virtue of its skillful methods, whichare applied to the three trainings [of ethics, contemplation, and wis-dom], as well as to all spheres of experience. Specifically, the ethics ofmantra delights the deities, being equal to that of awareness-holders.Contemplation in the mantra way is connected to a superior sphere ofexperience. The wisdom of mantra is distinguished by its profundityand vastness both in common and extraordinary [aspects], as are theother two trainings. Furthermore, the skillful methods of deity andmantra are applied to all spheres of experience. Hence, mantra is said tobe extraordinary.THE EXCEPTIONAL NATURE OF THE MANTRA SYSTEM [iii]This section has four parts: identification of the essence of mantra; themeaning of the term mantra; a general presentation of divisions withinmantra and tantra; and a detailed discussion of the systems of the four setsof tantra.IDENTIFICATION OF THE ESSENCE OF MANTRA [aa]Its essence is the union of emptiness and compassion.The essence of mantra is the union of wisdom (emptiness) and method(great compassion). This is stated in the Kalachakra Root Tantra:53Mantra is so called because it serves as a protectionFor the elements of body, speech, and mind.The term mantra denotes the immutable:The pristine awareness of emptiness."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF TANTRA\u000285Mantra arising from merit and pristine awarenessHas the nature of emptiness and compassion.THE MEANING OF THE TERM MANTRA [bb]The meaning of mantra is to protect the mind from conceptualobjectification.From an etymological perspective, the meaning of the [Sanskrit] termmantra is explained as follows: man [the first syllable] means “mind” andtraya, “to protect,” hence “mantra” (sngags), since it protects the mindfrom conceptual objectification. The Continuation of the GuhyasamajaTantra states:54Whatever mind arises in dependence onThe sense powers and their objects:That mind is referred to as “man”And “tra” means that which protects it.Whatever vows and pledges are consideredTo be completely free from worldly conductAnd safeguarded by all of the vajras:Those are referred to as “mantric conduct.”55From the perspective of a direct translation, mantra means “secret utter-ance” because it is accomplished with secrecy and in concealment; or, fromanother perspective, because it cannot be understood by those unqualifiedto be its practitioners. Thus, it is called “secret mantra” (gsang sngags). Ac-cordingly, the master Shraddhakaravarman’s Short Guide to the Meaning ofHighest Yoga Tantra explains:56It is secret because its practices are accomplished with secrecyand in concealment, or because it cannot be understood byunqualified persons.A GENERAL PRESENTATION OF DIVISIONS WITHIN MANTRA ANDTANTRA [cc]In this section, there are two parts: the forms of [practice of ] mantra; anddivisions of tantras."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRATHE FORMS OF PRACTICE OF MANTRA [1']This section has two parts: the main discussion; and an ancillary statementon the distinction between mantra and tantra.THE MAIN DISCUSSION [a']The three forms of practice are the best, the lesser, and thesecondary;In essence, great bliss, pride of being the deity, and mantra withits applications.Alternatively, the seven forms are the complete, partial, special,Initial bliss, almost complete, some measure, and slight greatbliss.There are three forms of mantra [practice], the best, the lesser, and thesecondary. The essence of the best form is great bliss; that of the lesser, thepride of being the deity; and that of the secondary, mere mantric rituals andapplications. The first is exemplified by the phase of completion; the sec-ond, by the phase of generation; and the third, by the means for accom-plishing minor activations.57The best and lesser forms represent the authentic mantra way becausethey pertain to the principles, or vows, of the mantra way and the aware-ness-holder.

Presentedhere is] part two, the divisions of tantra. This begins with a general presen-tation of the different ways tantra is divided, followed by a detailed discus-sion of the rationale for tantra’s division into four sets.A GENERAL PRESENTATION OF THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF TANTRA [a']Tantra is divided in many ways: into two sets, outer and inner;Into three, action, conduct, and yoga; into four, five, six, andmore.In answer to how many divisions exist within the tantric [system] of thesecret mantra way, there are ways of dividing tantra into two sets (outer andinner) right up to a division into seven.First, reference to the division into two sets is found in the IndestructibleEssence Ornament Tantra:1The divisions of tantra are to be understoodBy knowing its distinction into outer and inner.Moreover, the master Abhayakara states:........"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAHold in your heart the outer and inner tantras of VajradharaThat have been transmitted in a successive lineage.The Teacher expanded methods such as mandalaInto two separate sets of tantra.It is clear from his Awn of Esoteric Instructions that Abhayakara maintainsthat, of the two sets of tantra spoken of, outer and inner, outer tantrarefers to action and conduct tantras, and inner, to the yoga and highestyoga tantras.The master Buddhaguhya presents an alternative viewpoint: the twofolddivision of tantra refers to action tantra and yoga tantra. Action tantra com-prises the Trisamayavyuha and other tantras up to and including theVairochanabhisambodhi; and yoga tantra, the Summation of Essential Prin-ciples and other tantras up to and including the Guhyasamaja. These twosets are also called outer and inner. Buddhaguhya states:Two sets of tantra, the outer and the inner, are explained.Certain scholars of Tibet differentiate these two sets of tantra on the basis ofsix factors, namely, teacher, place [where the tantra was taught], students,articles for offering, path, and essential principles.2The rationale for the division into outer tantra and inner tantra is thatconduct tantra and the tantra below emphasize ablution and other outerphysical and verbal activities, and are therefore considered outer tantras.Yoga tantra and the tantra above emphasize contemplation and other inner(mental) practices, and are therefore included within the inner set. Thisaccounts for the division of tantra into two sets.Reference to the division of tantra into three sets is found in the Inde-structible Essence Ornament Tantra:3Action tantra, tantra of both, and yoga tantraWhich were spoken expressly are not like that.Buddhaguhya, Lilavajra, and Anandagarbha4 all explain that tantra hasthe three divisions of action, conduct (or tantra of both), and yoga tantra.The rationale is that yoga and great yoga tantras are alike in their empha-sis on contemplation, which is an inner practice, and are therefore sub-sumed under yoga tantra. This accounts for the division of tantra intothree sets."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE DIVISIONS OF TANTRA\u000291[Gunabhadra’s] Indestructible Nectar Commentary5 presents an alterna-tive way to divide tantra into three sets:Action, union (or yoga tantra), and secret tantra...Reference to the division of tantra into four sets is found in the Indestruc-tible Tent:6Action tantra is for those of lesser [faculties];Yoga without action, for those with greater [faculties];Yoga tantra, for superior sentient beingsAnd highest yoga tantra, for those even greater.In addition, [Shraddhakaravarman’s] Short Guide to the Meaning of HighestYoga Tantra states:7There are four entrances to the resultant indestructible way of secretmantra. These are generally known as action tantra, conduct tantra,yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra.Similar statements are found in most tantras and commentaries. Essentiallythe same way of division occasionally appears under a number of differentnames. The Samputa Tantra [for example] states:8The four [sexual pleasures of ] laughing, gazing,Holding hands, and union are contained in the four tantras,Compared to the way of worms [in wood].9A similar reference is found in [Pundarika’s] Stainless Light.10 The rationalefor this [division] will be discussed below.Reference to the division of tantra into five is found in the Compendiumon the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra]:11O Blessed One, what is the extent of the yoga tantra, tantra ofboth, conduct tantra, action tantra, and skills tantra?The rationale for this division is as follows: The basis for the division isaction tantra in general, which is split into two. Action tantras that areconcerned with attainment principally of the supreme power [awakening]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAare collectively designated as “action tantra.” Action tantras concerned withthe attainment principally of ordinary powers12 are collectively designatedas “skills tantra.” Although “tantra of both” generally refers to conduct tantra,Shraddhakaravarman considers yoga tantra to be the tantra of both since,in yoga tantra, inner contemplative yoga and outer activity both serve asauxiliaries to contemplation. Accordingly, here yoga tantra is given the des-ignation of “tantra of both,” and the name “yoga tantra” is applied to thehighest yoga tantra. This accounts for the division of tantra into five sets.This particular way of division of tantra is the one adhered to by Nagarjunaand other masters.The patriarchs of the Sakya school13 place what is referred to as the“sutra skills tantra” into a set separate from action tantra. All of the sutrateachings that are concerned with retention mantras (dharani) and re-lated rites, the Blue Beryl Light Discourse and its Dharani,14 for example,constitute this set.An alternative way of dividing tantra into five sets has as its source theOcean of Sky-Farers Tantra, as well as Shantipa’s Presentation of the ThreeWays,15 and other works. Here, the five sets are action tantra, conduct tantra,yoga tantra, great yoga tantra, and highest great yoga tantra. Great yogatantra refers to the highest father tantra; and highest great yoga tantra, thehighest mother tantra.A division of tantra into six sets places the skills tantra in a set separatefrom action tantra, and splits yoga tantra into two, father yoga tantra andmother yoga tantra. The basis for this way of division is the IndestructibleTent:16 The yogini tantra is known as the sixth tantra.Another way of dividing tantra into six is explained in [Tripitakamala’s]Lamp of the Three Modes.17 The six are action tantra, root tantra, con-duct tantra, yoga tantra, high yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra. Inthis system, action tantra is subdivided: tantras that emphasize outer ac-tivity are considered action tantra; and those that do not, root tantra. Asin the previous [Ocean of Sky-Farers Tantra’s] way of division, the fathertantra and mother tantra are considered to be high yoga tantra and high-est yoga tantra, respectively. This accounts for the division of tantra intosix sets.Reference to the division into seven sets is found in Lord Atisha’s Com-mentary on the Lamp for the Path:18"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE DIVISIONS OF TANTRA\u000293The names action tantra, conduct tantra, and so on, refer to actiontantra, conduct tantra, skills tantra, tantra of both, yoga tantra,great yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra.The rationale for this way of dividing tantra is that the action and conducttantras that have as their major subject-matter the minor rites performed togain [powers of ] the pills, eye-elixir, and so on, are considered to be of aseparate set, skills tantra. Hence, the Compendium of Skills and other tantrasare considered as skills tantra.19 Tantras that have components of both con-duct tantra (and the tantra set below) and the yoga tantra, such as the Net ofMagical Manifestation and the Lord of the Lotus Dancers, are considered tobe the tantra of both.20 Father tantra and mother tantra are considered to bethe great yoga tantra and highest yoga tantra, respectively.21 This accountsfor the division of tantra into seven sets. In addition, there are many ways inwhich further subdivision of these sets is asserted.A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RATIONALE FOR TANTRA’S DIVISIONINTO FOUR SETS [b']The division into four sets is widely accepted because tantraswere taughtIn consideration of four kinds of recipients of the teachings,As well as the persons to be converted, different castes, faculties,Objects of purification, purificatory means, states, times, andother factors.Of those [different ways of division], the one well known as “the four sets oftantra” is found in the words of the majority of Indian and Tibetan tantricmasters. The rationale for the division of tantra in this way [is explained asfollows]:Four sets of tantra were taught in consideration of the four differentkinds of recipients of the teachings. A person whose inclination is [theperforming of ] many outer actions, such as ablution, cleanliness, and soon, is the intended practitioner of action tantra. Someone who is inter-ested in essential reality and who prefers few outer rites is the intendedpractitioner of conduct tantra. One who considers many outer rites to bea source of distraction and is interested solely in meditation on essentialreality is the intended practitioner of yoga tantra. A person interested inenjoying everything in the state of pristine awareness wherein method"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAand wisdom are inseparable is the intended practitioner of highest yogatantra.Additionally, the four sets of tantra were taught in order to convert fourkinds of followers of mistaken paths. By presenting the tantric teachings inaccordance with the emotional patterns particular to these four kinds, indi-viduals would be uplifted spiritually and led to the true path. To convertthe devotees of Shiva who are dominated by desire, the highest yoga tantrawas taught. To convert the devotees of Vishnu who are dominated by aver-sion, conduct tantra was taught. To convert the devotees of Brahma whoare dominated by delusion, action tantra was taught. To convert personswith uncertain emotional patterns who accept the tenets of whichever ofthe three [Hindu religious trends] they come in contact with, yoga tantrawas taught. Nagarjuna, Subhutipalita, [Anandagarbha,] and other mastersare known to have asserted this rationale as found in the Summation ofEssential Principles.22Moreover, tantra was taught in four sets to accommodate recipientswho are members of the four castes, or who share their traits: Brahminsdominated by delusion who practice the doctrine of Brahma and whodelight in a path involving cleanliness, recitation [of mantras] and liturgy,fire-offering rituals, and austerity; members of the merchant caste, domi-nated by pride, who practice the doctrine of the demi-gods and who de-light in physical, verbal, and mental disciplines; members of the royalcaste, [also dominated by pride,] who follow the doctrine of the gods andwho are incapable of [leading] an austere life, indulging instead in themany pleasures of court life, and who delight in exercising dominion overtheir kingdoms through sealed edicts; and persons belonging to the me-nial caste, dominated by both anger and desire, who practice sexual unionand ritual killing in the cults of Maheshvara and other deities, and delightin engaging in various base acts, such as ingesting feces and urine, with-out any notions of purity and impurity. The four sets, action tantra, andso on, were taught for practitioners who are members of these four castes,respectively, principally to spiritually nurture those who among them areof superior faculties. Accordingly, the Marvellous Cemetery [Ornament]states:23To convert the brahmin caste, the merchant caste,The royal caste, and the menial caste or outcastes,Tantra was presented in four parts:Action, conduct, yoga, and highest yoga."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE DIVISIONS OF TANTRA\u000295Furthermore, tantra’s division into four sets takes into considerationthe faculties [of the recipients]. Action tantra was taught for those of lowfaculties; conduct tantra, for the average; yoga tantra, for the sharp; and high-est yoga tantra, for the very sharp. This is stated in the Indestructible Tent.Another consideration in tantra’s fourfold division is the object of puri-fication, the emotional afflictions, which may be slight, moderate, strong,and exceedingly strong in intensity. Accordingly, the Bright Lamp states:Action tantra is intended for the type of person with major oraverage delusion; conduct tantra, minimal delusion; yoga tantra,minimal or moderate desire, aversion, and delusion; higher yogatantra, intense desire, aversion, and delusion; and yogini tantra,the most intense desire, aversion, and delusion.The higher yoga tantra and yogini tantra mentioned in this citation areboth highest yoga tantra, and the emotional afflictions to be purified allbelong to the category of exceedingly strong afflictions. Thus, there areactually just four [sets] being referred to.Furthermore, division into four sets is based on four forms of desire tobe purified. These four desires which are experienced in the desire realm arementioned in [Vasubandhu’s] Treasury [of Phenomenology]:24Sexual satisfaction is gained through intercourse,Holding hands, laughter, and gazing [at one’s partner].To explain, gods of the desire realm in the heaven of Mastery over Others’Creations experience sexual desire that is satisfied by gazing at the partner;gods in Enjoying Creations, by laughing; gods in Joyful and Free from Con-flict, by holding hands; gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-three and below,as well as men and animals,25 by sexual intercourse. As remedies for sexualdesire, the four sets of tantra were taught, each set providing a deity yogathat uses one of these particular forms of desire in the path.26Tantra’s division is posited in a [fourfold] order that also reflects thethree aspects of the path, namely, the [different types of ] view, meditation,and conduct that serve as purificatory means. The views are represented bythe four major trends of Buddhist philosophy [that of the analysts,traditionists, idealists, and centrists] to which the action tantras and theother [three] tantras respectively correspond.27 The meditations comprisefour deity yogas, with distinctions in the meditations on the deity [accord-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAing to the tantra]: Action tantra involves meditation on an external deityonly; conduct tantra, in addition, involves meditation on an inner, natu-rally present deity;28 yoga tantra, meditation on a deity that is the essence ofoneself [as the deity] inseparable from [the external deity] in front; and thehighest yoga tantra, meditation on the deity [as for yoga tantra] based onthe knowledge that oneself [as the deity] and [the external deity in] frontare inseparable in every respect. The types of conduct comprise differentdegrees of physical, verbal, and mental [inner] activity. Conduct involvingmainly engagement in physical and verbal activity is considered to be ac-tion tantra; equal proportions of engagement in physical and verbal activityand inner contemplation, conduct tantra; engagement principally in innercontemplation, yoga tantra; and engagement principally in pristine aware-ness, highest yoga tantra.As pointed out in Kalachakra, the division of tantra into four sets takesinto consideration the purified aspect of the four states of waking, dream,deep sleep, and sexual union;29 the four eras, which refers to the era ofcompleteness, the era of three quarters, the era of two quarters, and the eraof turmoil; and the four periods of the day and night.30 There are yet otherbases for the fourfold division.Thus, tantra has been taught in consideration of various factors, the recipi-ents [of the teachings], and so forth, and therefore, [the division of tantra into]the “four sets of tantra” is widely accepted. As well, the four sets representdemarcations in sequence, caliber, and subtlety. Accordingly, the tantras state:Based on the former, the latter arises.Because of levels from inferior to superior,And from the gross to the subtle...The statement “Based on the former, the latter arises” is explained in [HevajraTantra] Two Examinations:31Teach the student the analysts’ philosophyAnd then the traditionists’ philosophy.After that, teach the experientialists’.Following that, teach the central way.Once all methods of mantra are known,Teach [the tantra of ] Hevajra.Thus, one should understand that just as the four philosophies are learnedsequentially, the four sets of tantra which nurture followers of these phi-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE DIVISIONS OF TANTRA\u000297losophies are also practiced in sequence. The nondual highest tantra shouldbe cultivated at the end of [the training in] the two highest tantras, that ofmethod [father] and that of wisdom [mother].The words “inferior to superior” are explained in the Indestructible Tent:32Action tantra is for those of lesser [faculties];[Yoga without action, for those with greater faculties;Yoga tantra, for superior sentient beingsAnd highest yoga tantra, for those even greater.]The phrase “gross to the subtle” is understood from these words of the tantra:More secret than the secret, extremely secret, supremely secret...The distinctive features particular to each of the four sets of tantra, suchas the persons who are recipients [of the teachings], the initiations thatconstitute the entrances to the path, and so forth, will be [discussed] indetail below. What follow are the main features in a concise form:The distinctive features of action tantra are principally the physical per-formance of mudras whereby the practitioner swiftly accomplishes an awak-ened body; the verbal recitation of mantras to swiftly accomplish awakenedspeech; and inner meditation on the deity, to swiftly accomplish awakenedmind and qualities.The distinctive features of conduct tantra are principally the viewing ofone’s body as the body of a perfect buddha, whereby the blessing of awak-ened body swiftly enters [one’s being]; viewing one’s speech as mantra,whereby the blessing of awakened speech swiftly enters; viewing one’s ownmind as pristine awareness, whereby the blessing of awakened mind is swiftlyreceived; and other features. [These blessings are received] because, by us-ing in the path [the practice of ] imagining oneself as a buddha, awakenedqualities are easily developed, and by using the result [of awakening] in thepath, the two accumulations [of merit and pristine awareness] are swiftlybrought to perfection. Furthermore, while methods that [require] complexpreparations such as veneration of depictions of deities on cloth do perfectthe two accumulations, making offerings to oneself [as the deity] and simi-lar methods are performed more easily, and certainly bring about the per-fection of the accumulations.The distinctive features of yoga tantra are principally the sealing of one’sbody with the great seal of the body [of the deity]; the sealing of one’s speech"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAwith the doctrine seal of the [deity’s] speech; the sealing of one’s mind withthe pledge seal of the [deity’s] mind; and the sealing of one’s actions withthe seal of the [deity’s] activity,33 all of which lead to the practitioner’s swiftachievement of [the state of ] all the transcendent ones.The distinctive features of highest yoga tantra are principally its clarityin the profound meaning of the phase of completion; its infinity of pro-found methods in the phase of generation; its absence of hardships in theachievement of awakening through the practice of these two [phases]; andits being intended for persons of exceptionally sharp faculties by virtue ofthese features. Consequently, the yogas of the two phases [of generationand completion] are distinctive features of highest yoga tantra only, not tobe found in the other tantra sets. This is the case because other tantras donot set forth a path that corresponds to the complete process of birth incyclic existence, nor do they set forth a path of training that brings to per-fection the authentic luminous clarity of death.34"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002993.

The first, the con-tent, has four parts: action tantra, conduct tantra, yoga tantra, and highestyoga tantra. The first system, that of action tantra, is presented here inseven parts: the meaning of the name “action tantra” and its essence; itsdivisions; initiations as the entrance to action tantra; vows and pledges tobe observed; practice of its path; types of powers to attain to; and the stagesof awakening, paths, and result.THE MEANING OF THE NAME AND THE ESSENCE OF ACTION TANTRA[i']Action tantra emphasizes outer conduct.Action tantra is so named because one engages in mantric practice based onteachings that emphasize outer conduct such as ablution, cleanliness, andpurity.The essence of action tantra is as stated in the Compendium on the Inde-structible Pristine Awareness Tantra:1To view [the profound truth] with apprehension and to observeutmost cleanliness; to be without the supreme bliss of the pristineawareness being; to lack the pride of oneself as the deity; not to bea receptacle for what is sublime; and due to that shortcoming, tobe conditioned by concepts about [the purity and impurity of ]things; to train thoroughly [in rituals of ablution, etc.] and therebypractice [deity yoga]: these [elements] are found in action tantra.To practice in order to develop mastery of the eight great pow-ers—mantra, medicine, fire-offering ritual, powder, eye-salve, swift-ness of foot, and so forth2—this [element] is found in skills tantra.To provide some clarification of those points, the following elements aresaid to apply to, or be contained within, action tantra: to view the profoundtruth with fear and apprehension3 due to an inferior intellect and to observeutmost cleanliness and purity, ablution, asceticism, and so forth; to not[develop] the pride of being the deity since there is no generation of oneselfas the pledge deity;4 to be without the supreme bliss of the pristine aware-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002101ness deity since the pristine awareness deity has not been invoked to mergeinto the pledge deity; not to be a receptacle for the sublime [teachings]5since one is unqualified to receive teachings on what is sublime and extraor-dinary, the deep meanings that were spoken with specific intention; anddue to the shortcoming of being unable to fathom the sublime, being condi-tioned by concepts about the purity or impurity of things, to train thor-oughly in [rituals of ] ablution, and so forth, and thereby to practice [deityyoga] in a subject-to-lord relationship with the deity.6Skills tantra is to practice by means of asceticism, recitation [of mantraand liturgy], and so on, in order to develop mastery of the eight great mun-dane powers, such as [the power of ] mantra and eye-salve.

The mundane families are the jewel [wealthy] family,the family of playing with five dice [or prosperity], and the family of ordi-nary worldlings.7Tantras that exemplify the [three supramundane] families are the tantraof Trisamayavyuha, lord of the transcendent family, and tantras of [other]buddhas; the tantra of Avalokiteshvara, lord of the lotus family; and thetantra of Vajrapani, lord of the vajra family.

They are therefore designated “dependent on the tran-scendent family.” On this point, the [Subahu] Tantra states:10Moreover, some do not belong hereBut are wanderers who depend on the Joyful One.That being the case, it would seem that those who were tamed bythe Buddha and who abide by pledges are included within thethree [supramundane] families.The above citation implicitly points out that even the ordinary mundanefamilies known as “wanderers” are included within the transcendent familybecause they are “dependent on the transcendent family.” Thus, all six familiesare included within the three supramundane families.All six families are included as well in the two categories of secret mantraand awareness mantra. [Buddhaguhya’s] Commentary on the DhyanottaraTantra states:11Awareness mantra comprises the female deity, her shape, theutterances associated with her method, and seals [mudras, insignia,]and so on. The opposite to that, [the male deity, and so on,] ischaracteristic of secret mantra.12THE ENTRANCE TO ACTION TANTRA: INITIATIONS [iii']...Its entrances, the water and diadem, establish the potentialsFor the two dimensions, after which the pledges are observed.For specific purposes, initiation is conferred in four parts; themandala is a colored powders one.The Essence of Pristine Awareness states:13It is widely known that in action tantraThere are the water and crown initiations."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002103This citation indicates that, as initiations serving as entrances to action tantra,the water and diadem are widely held to be the only two. These two initia-tions serve to ripen [the student’s mind] in that the water initiation estab-lishes the potential for [the attainment of ] the reality dimension ofawakening, and the diadem initiation, the form dimension. Concerningthe water initiation, the Manjushri Root Tantra states:14Each [student] should be conferred the initiation five [times]according to the desired method.Here it is specified that the water initiation is given five times: [first, with]the vase [dedicated to all beings] at the entrance outside the mandala; [sec-ond, with] the vase [dedicated] to all deities in the second mandala; [third,with] the vase [dedicated] to proclaimers and solitary sages in the thirdmandala; [fourth, with] the vase [dedicated] to bodhisattvas; and [fifth,with] the victory vase [dedicated] to buddhas. Such procedure is clearlymentioned in [the tantras of ] all the [other] families as well.15 For the dia-dem initiation, [use of ] a crown is not specified. It is explained, however, thatthe act of touching the crown of the head [of the student] with the handsclasped in the mudra [representing the diadem] is to confer the initiation.In that way, the water and diadem initiations, which form the main part[of an action tantra initiation], are received, after which the pledges of ac-tion tantra must be observed. The actual ripening process is contained inthat alone. However, when subdivided to serve specific purposes, there arefour parts to the conferral of initiation, as explained in the General Tantra:16the water and diadem initiations to gain the status of vajra master in theaction tantra’s own system; [the appended] vajra student initiation to be-stow transmission of the mantra (of the deity on which the flower has fallen17)in order to gain power from awareness mantras; the initiation of protectionthrough [purificatory] ablution, the activity to overcome negative influ-ences and to pacify obstacles; and the initiation of the eight auspicious sub-stances18 to increase wealth.The vajra master initiation in the action tantra’s own system is accom-plished by the water and diadem initiations in themselves. Nevertheless, asstated in the General Tantra, the initiation is properly accomplished by con-ferring, in addition to those two, the authorization to draw and teachmandala. The same tantra also states that through receiving initiation into amandala of the transcendent family, one becomes a vajra master of all thethree families; through the Avalokiteshvara initiation [of the lotus family],"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAa vajra master of the lotus and vajra families; and through the Vajrapaniinitiation [of the vajra family], a vajra master of just that family. In actiontantra, the mandala used for the conferral of an initiation is said to be exclu-sively one of colored powders.VOWS AND PLEDGES TO BE OBSERVED [iv']It is said:The root [of attainment] is to observe one’s pledges.While this point is mentioned incidentally, the way one assumes pledges isexplained as follows: The occasion for assuming pledges is, as stated in theTrisamayavyuha Tantra, at the conclusion of the preparatory ritual [of an ini-tiation]. The procedure for assuming them is as described in the same tantra:19One begins with the supplication, “Buddhas and bodhisattvas,please heed me!” and continues, “I offer myself to you. Please blessme, guard and protect me, and bestow on me the power of thegreat pledges.” These words repeated three times constitute theritual for assuming the pledges.One makes an offering of oneself in order to assume the pledges. The rea-son for doing so is explained in this way: A person is considered to exist ontwo levels, subtle and coarse. By offering body, speech, and mind—the coarseperson—these three become owned by buddhas and bodhisattvas. At thatpoint, one is possessed of the disposition of all buddhas and bodhisattvas, adisposition that is one of shunning the ten unwholesome deeds and practic-ing the ten wholesome ones.20 Thus, one comes to assume [the ethics of thebuddhas] as the very essence of the commitment of relative awakening mind.By offering the subtle person which, as the essence of emptiness, is insepa-rable from the reality dimension, one comes to assume ultimate awakeningmind.21 On the basis of those two, one assumes the other remaining pledgesby repeating the last three phrases of the above supplication. This explana-tion is that of Buddhaguhya, as found in his Commentary [Epitomizing] theVairochanabhisambodhi Tantra.22The nature of the vows and pledges to be safeguarded in action tantra isdiscussed in detail in a prior [book, Buddhist Ethics] of this [Infinite Oceanof Knowledge].23"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002105PRACTICE OF THE PATH IN ACTION TANTRA [v']This section has four parts: entering; approaching; effecting powers; andusing powers.ENTERING [aa']The process of entering is as just explained: receiving the initiation andassuming the pledges associated with the chosen deity.APPROACHING [bb']This has two parts: auxiliary elements; and the main elements.AUXILIARY ELEMENTS [1'']The process of approaching incorporates ten auxiliary elements....The process of approaching [the deity] incorporates ten elements: the [quali-fied] mantric practitioner; the deity of the mantra practice; the helper, amost excellent companion for practice; substances such as realgar;24 dili-gence in practice; a region such as the central country;25 a place for dwell-ing, such as a mountain top; a [specific] time [for practice], the springmonths, morning, and so on; a representation of the deity complete in alldetails, such as a painting or a metal-cast statue; and fearlessness and endur-ing fortitude. The Subahu Tantra states that familiarization [with the deity]should be performed based on these ten elements.MAIN ELEMENTS: FOUR ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES IN THE PRACTICE OFFAMILIARIZATION [2'']...The main elementsAre the essential principles: that of oneself comprises six qualities;That of the deity, deity as form, as letter, and as nature;That of recitation, immersion in sound, mind, and base;And that of meditative absorption, dwelling in fire, in sound,and at the limit of sound.Familiarization with the deity is perfected in a lord-subjectmanner."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAGenerally, what is received of the initiation’s mind-ripening process wouldbe used in meditation on the stages of the path, and even the result attainedwould be a concordant one. This is the case in all four sets of tantra. Thus,here [in action tantra] as well, this applies to the main methods in the path,the practice with signs, which uses in the path [the content of ] the diademinitiation, and the practice without signs, which uses in the path [the con-tent of ] the water initiation. The method of meditation in this path may besubdivided into four essential principles: oneself, deity, recitation, and medi-tative absorption.26ONESELF [a''][The preliminary to] the meditation on the essential principle of oneselfincludes ablution and observing other forms of cleanliness; performing therituals of protecting oneself and the place;27 invoking the deity to mergeinto a painting or a statue in front and then making offerings;28 and in thepresence of the deity, remaining in the meditation posture appropriate toone’s family.29Next, the dimension of reality is used in the path to cultivate pristineawareness: The base to be ascertained by means of the view is the essence ofenlightenment itself. This is done by meditating on the essential principleof oneself, which is the absence of intrinsic existence of the aggregates, andso on. [This meditation] includes six qualities: the absence of concepts re-lated to an apprehender and the apprehended; absence of appearances inthe nonconceptual state; absence of forms [composed] of the most subtleparticles of matter; absence of the fluctuations of conceptual characteristics;being of the nature of luminous clarity, which transcends emptiness as a merenegation due to these [four] qualities; and one’s essence having the character-istic of intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature].THE DEITY [b'']For this, the manifest dimension of awakening is used in the path to cultivatemerit. It comprises three deities: the deity as form, as letter, and as nature.The deity as form is of two kinds: deity as form complete with face andarms and distinguished by particular eyes, and so forth; and deity as seal,such as a wheel or vajra. The deity as letter is also of two kinds: deity as theforms of letters [of the mantra], and deity as the sound [of the mantra]. Thedeity as nature, also of two kinds, comprises the deity as the emptiness"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002107nature (the object) and the deity as nonconceptual pristine awareness (thesubject).All of these, when used as the essence of contemplation, are includedwithin the six characteristic deities, which are stated [in the VajravidaranaTantra]:30Emptiness, letter, sound, form,Seal, and sign are the six.First, the deity as emptiness is to remain absorbed in emptiness, theessence of ultimate awakening mind, in which the essential principle ofoneself and that of the deity are of an inseparability beyond concepts.Second, the deity as letter is to meditate on the particular deity [one ispracticing] in the form of the written letters of the [deity’s] mantra restingon a moon disk (representing one’s mind) visualized in space [in front].Also considered to be the letter deity is to meditate simply on the moon[omitting the letters].Third, the deity as sound is to meditate on the resonant sounds of themantra (on the moon) associated with one of the [three] deities of the threefamilies31 to which the recitation practice for complete familiarization isdirected.Fourth, the deity as form is to meditate on the complete form of thedeity. [The first step involves] meditating that light radiating from the let-ters of the mantra fulfills two aims;32 then, [as the light reconverges, theletters] transform into the deity’s complete form.Fifth, the deity as seal is to perform the hand mudras for blessing, suchas the mudra of the crown protrusion, 33 and while reciting the appropriatemantra, to touch the corresponding places of the body with the mudra.Alternatively, one makes the pledge mudra of that particular [family].Sixth, the deity as sign is to recall, in all circumstances, the form of thedeity as meditated in the state of equipoise so that the appearances of theouter world and its inhabitants are regarded as pure visions, imagined as thedeity’s residence, form, and resources.These meditations are practiced without allowing the mind to becomedistracted from its focuses and while holding the life [wind]34 until thebranches of the recitation are completed,35 or for as long as possible. Thus,one remains single-mindedly absorbed in the experience of oneself visual-ized in the form of the deity: This constitutes the essential principle of thedeity."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAMANTRA RECITATION [c'']The essential principle of mantra recitation has a number of prescriptions:the tool for recitation (the chaplet used for counting); the place of recita-tion; the time when one should recite; the extent of [time, number, etc.,required to complete] recitation; and the rules followed during the period ofrecitation. These prescriptions, as set forth in the Susiddhi and other tantras,36should be applied impeccably to [the following two forms of ] recitation.The ordinary recitation for familiarization is carried out as follows: Amoon disk, [symbol of ] relative awakening mind, is imagined in the heartof the particular deity of one of the three families [generated in front].Located upon the moon disk is the mantra to be recited, with a sonorousquality of sound, arranged in its respective place.37 The mantra is regardedas being like the secret mantra deities in actuality. The uninterrupted mind-fulness that recalls this again and again dispels mistaken bad thoughts to-ward one’s focus of practice [i.e., the deity], and leads to single-mindedpractice: This is the recitation of the secret mantras of the masters of thethree families.38The special recitation leads to the attainment of powers. The DhyanottaraTantra states:39Immerse yourself in sound, mind, and base.Dwell in the immutable base of the secret mantra.Recite the secret mantra without imperfections.When tired, rest in [the principle of ] oneself.In this citation, “base” refers to the contemplation of the [form of the]deity. “Mind” refers to the visualization of the moon disk (the nature ofrelative awakening mind) in the heart of the deity. “Sound” refers to thecontemplation of the syllables of the mantra, possessed of a sonorous qual-ity, on the moon disk. “Immerse yourself ” means that when practicingthese three contemplations, while retaining the life [wind], one focuses withundivided attention on the form of the deity in front, the moon, and [syl-lables of ] the mantra; and performs mental or whispered recitation of themantra. Following that, when one cannot hold the breath and exhales,40 toremain in the pride of oneself as the deity, [the subjective] “base” is to “dwellin the immutable base of the secret mantra.” “Recite the secret mantra with-out imperfections” means that these recitations of mantras are done with-out such imperfections as elongating some letters or clipping off others,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002109reciting too quickly or too slowly, or [disregarding] the bent and curved-[shaped] vowel signs.41 “When tired, rest in [the principle of ] oneself ” meansthat when recitation has led to discouragement or fatigue, to rest in a statefree of any concept, which is the essential principle of oneself.This latter mode of recitation, the special, is one characterized by single-mindedness, through which mental quiescence is accomplished.42 Exceptfor periods of resting [in one’s essential nature], one directs undivided at-tention to the deity in front, and recitation is continued until the impres-sion of separateness of the deity in front and oneself subsides, and a vividexperience of the inseparability of the deity and oneself occurs. By this stan-dard, the former recitation is termed ordinary; and this latter one, special.These two constitute the essential principle of mantra recitation.MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION [d'']The Dhyanottara Tantra states:43The secret mantra dwelling in fire grants powers.Dwelling in sound grants contemplation.The limit of sound grants liberation.These constitute the threefold essential principle.This citation refers to three different aspects of this essential principle, orthree different meditative absorptions:DWELLING IN FIRE [i'']In the heart of [oneself as] the deity, one imagines a very still fire, like theflame of a butter lamp, within which is a moon disk with the syllables of themantra arranged in a string of one following the other. One visualizes thiswith undivided attention and, while holding the life [wind], cultivates thismeditation until the experience of vivid appearance occurs. This practiceserves as the basis for the performance of all forms of activations, such asappeasement.44DWELLING IN SOUND [ii'']At the heart of oneself [as the deity] is a moon disk, inside of which is thedeity as base. [In the deity’s heart] is a flame within which is a string of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAsyllables of the mantra. Alternatively, the string of syllables is visualized onthe moon disk alone. One examines the syllables closely. Once the contem-plation has become perfectly vivid for at least a short while, one no longerfocuses on the shape of the letters but maintains attention solely on the so-nority of the spontaneously arising sounds of the mantra, resonating like thechimes of a bell.45 One focuses on this single-mindedly while holding the life[wind], and trains in this until an experience of vivid appearance occurs. Thismeditation serves as the basis for the attainment of mental quiescence.THE LIMIT OF SOUND [iii'']Analysis and precise examination of the mantra’s sound alone leads to theunderstanding that its essence is without origin, cessation, or abiding. Basedon that, [the practitioner] rests in contemplation within the state of pristineawareness, which is devoid of any concepts, the essential principle of one-self. From that contemplation arises the pristine awareness of insight,46 whichserves as the direct substantial cause of liberation.The above three constitute the essential principle of meditative ab-sorption.To practice the various activations [of appeasement, etc.] related to specialpowers successfully, one must first meditate on those [four essential prin-ciples] as they have been explained. (This is not a definite requirement forthe development of minor powers and activations,47 which are effected evenby common recitation alone.) Accordingly, first one must perfect familiar-ization for which the deity generated in front is regarded as superior, like alord, and oneself as inferior, like a subject; afterwards, one works for theattainment of powers.On this subject, Venerable [Taranata] of Jonang and his followers assertthat in action tantra, as a general rule, the practice with signs involves nogeneration of oneself as the deity as part of the deity yoga meditation; nordoes the generation of the deity in front involve [the prior] generation ofthe pledge deity. [The practice with signs] comprises only the invitation ofthe pristine awareness deity, exhibition of mudras, making offerings, recita-tion of the mantra, and finally the request for the deity’s departure. Thesecond practice, without signs, is contemplation on emptiness and solelythat which is in common with the sutra [tradition].48 The explanation ofthe six deities and attendant points, they say, is distinctively that of theconduct tantra, and certainly not the system of action tantra."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002111Most of the earlier masters of Tibet adhered to the system of the sixdeities and the other aspects [of familiarization] as mentioned above butmaintained that there is no generation of oneself as the deity. Others haveestablished conclusively that [action tantra] does involve the generation ofoneself as the deity.49 Karma Trinlé and others say that the ordinary formsof action tantra do not include generation of oneself as the deity, whereasthe special forms do.50 The class [of action tantra] that teaches generation ofoneself as an action tantra deity through all the four branches of self-gen-eration,51 they say, represents a system of practice of action tantra like thatof the highest yoga tantra, not the system of action tantra itself. In whichever way the practice of this set of tantra is done, [with orwithout self-generation,] it is said to require [these elements]: austeritiessuch as ablution, cleanliness and purity, and fasting, as well as strict purityin offering articles [to the deity], which must be untouched by the flesh ofanimals (except on a few occasions of performing fierce activations and fora few special practices such as that of Krodha Uchusma and Mahabala52);conformity to the vows of a celibate layperson or to higher monastic vowswhen doing familiarization or effecting powers. Apart from some subsec-tions in the tantra, the path using desire is exclusively that of the practitio-ner looking at the male and female deities (generated in front) gazing at oneanother.EFFECTING POWERS [cc']The powers effected are articles, body, and wealth, equal infortune to that of desire realm gods.Once one has seen signs of one’s nearness to the deity through the yoga offamiliarization, one begins to develop powers, the essence of which is toattain [the state of ] awareness-holder or sky-farer, whose status in terms ofarticles, body, and wealth is equal in fortune to that of the desire realm gods.The articles include sword and eye elixir, which enable one to traversecelestial dimensions.The body is one that is purified of the coarseness of the aggregates, andso forth, and manifests eight qualities of lordliness, such as subtleness andlightness, enabling one to traverse celestial dimensions.The wealth ranges from human wealth like that of a universal [monarch]to the wealth in celestial dimensions which is equal to that of the desirerealm gods."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAUSING POWERS [dd']Powers are used for provisional or ultimate goals.Powers are used for the attainment of provisional and ultimate goals.

The uncommon aspect is the attainment of theresult of [the path of ] proclaimers and solitary sages through having engagedin a mantric practice without the [altruistic] motivation of the universal way.The ultimate goal, which depends on the support of awareness-holder orsky-farer status, is the actualization of awakening characterized by threedimensions as described in action tantra, accomplished through applica-tion of the perfections in the practice of the secret mantra system.TYPES OF POWERS AND THE WAY TO EFFECT THEM [vi']Three types of powers are effected in the appropriate manner.The powers to be effected are categorized in this system [action tantra]according to principal considerations [of essence, family, etc.], each of whichcomprises three types.The three types of powers categorized according to essence are the high-est powers, which include the attainment of awareness-holder status, super-normal cognitive powers, and perfect knowledge of treatises; the middlingpowers, invisibility, youthfulness, and speed-walking; and the lowest pow-ers, ability to control, kill, and drive away [harmful beings];53 or, alterna-tively, as explained above, the three of articles, body, and wealth.The three types of powers categorized according to family are the tran-scendent family power, which is the power of appeasement; the enrichingpower of the lotus family; and the fierce power of the vajra family.The three types of powers categorized according to the deity [who grantsthem] are the power of appeasement granted by the lord of the family deity;the power of enriching, by the mother deity; and the power of the fierceactivation, by the wrathful deity.The three types of powers categorized according to the indication [of theattainment of powers] are [the powers gained when] substances [used togain powers] blaze with fire; give off smoke; and give off heat."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"ACTION TANTRA\u0002113The three types of powers categorized according to the promulgatorare [the powers gained from] mantras [spoken] by exalted ones [buddhasand bodhisattvas]; by gods; and by beings living above the earth [such asyakshas].Although the bestower of a power [the deity] may be of highest rank,there are known to be cases of a low power being granted owing to thefamiliarization not being carried out with proper diligence on the part ofthe practitioner. However, if familiarization is done correctly, even a low-ranking deity, having petitioned other [higher-ranking ones], may grantsupreme power.As to the way powers are effected, this is pointed out by [the words of theroot verses] “effected in the appropriate manner.” To begin with, one shouldexamine portents that indicate whether or not there will be success [in achiev-ing powers].54 If the signs are favorable, one should apply the many meth-ods taught [in action tantra] such as effecting powers by means of fire-offeringrituals or doing so simply by recitation of the mantra and meditation. [Whiledoing so,] three times [each day], one should make offerings [to the deity],confess [unwholesome deeds], rejoice [in virtue], make noble aspirations,read the Transcendent Wisdom scriptures, make mandalas, observe precepts,and perform rites of protection [of oneself and the place].

The families ofdeities of those [three] families are the same as the three supramundanefamilies of action tantra [transcendent, lotus, and vajra], respectively. It issaid that conduct tantra may also be divided into five families without con-tradicting the threefold division.4ENTRANCE TO CONDUCT TANTRA: INITIATIONS [iii']...The outer entering is to receive five initiations, the water andthe others."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CONDUCT TANTRA\u0002117Conduct tantra consists of the three practices of entering, effecting powers,and using powers. The entering practice is twofold, the outer and the inner.The outer practice of entering has two parts: initiations and pledges.Concerning the initiations, the Essence of Pristine Awareness states:5It is clearly evident that conduct tantraHas the two initiations of action tantra,As well as those of the vajra, bell, and name.As stated in this passage, conduct tantra is known to have five initia-tions: water, diadem, vajra, bell, and name. The VairochanabhisambodhiTantra mentions only the water initiation, plus the authorizations [givenwith the symbols] of the chirurgical eye-spoon and the mirror and theauthorization to teach.6 Even [Buddhaguhya’s] commentary on thistantra7 does not refer explicitly to the diadem and the other initiations.However, the five initiations are clearly taught in the Vajrapani Initia-tion, as well as in a few other [conduct tantras]. Thus, in this system, onereceives the vajra master initiation of the conduct tantra upon receiving thefive initiations.Taking the Vairochanabhisambodhi as example, the first initiation of thevase purifies the stains that cause lower forms of life. The second washesaway the seeds of cyclic existence. The third creates the seeds of the twoaccumulations associated with the first to the tenth stage of awakening.8The fourth plants the seeds for becoming a regent of a buddha. The diademinitiation plants the seeds for the [thirty-two] major and [eighty] minormarks of the body of a buddha; the bell initiation, the seeds for the sixtyqualities of the melodious speech of a buddha;9 the vajra initiation, theseeds for the twofold omniscience of the mind of a buddha; and the nameinitiation, the seeds for having one’s name known throughout the threerealms. The authorizations of the chirurgical eye-spoon and the mirror, theauthorization to teach the doctrine, and other rites grant permission tocarry out awakened activity for the benefit of others. Although the fiveinitiations of awareness [water, diadem, bell, vajra, and name]10 bear thesame names as [those comprised by the vase initiation of ] the higher tantrasets, they differ in meaning.The Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra states that initiations in conduct tantraare conferred within mandalas that are elaborate, unelaborate, or extremelyunelaborate. Furthermore, initiation within the elaborate mandala is of"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"118\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA[two] types: conferral using an outer mandala made of colored powders;and conferral using the inner mandala of one’s body.

According to theVairochanabhisambodhi Tantra, the pledges and vows are assumed at threedifferent moments of the initiation: during the preparatory ritual [of aninitiation]; upon entry to the mandala; and at the conclusion of the initia-tion by making a promise [to maintain them].The first, taken during the preparatory ritual, is the vow [known as]unobscured throughout the three times. To take this vow, one makes anoffering of one’s own body [to the buddhas and bodhisattvas]. Through thisact, one comes to hold the very essence of the commitment of relative awak-ening mind, in the way explained above in the context of the action tantra.The second, taken upon entry to the mandala, is the formation of theultimate awakening mind in accordance with ritual. For this, one is blessedby the mantra and hand mudra of the ultimate dimension of phenomenaand meditates on [the meaning of ] emptiness. Then, one is blessed with themantra and hand mudra of the wheel of the doctrine,11 whereupon oneimagines oneself in the form of Vajrasattva, which is the appearance aspectof emptiness. This vow is thereby distinguished by virtue of its vast andprofound aspects, or by the methods with signs and without signs.12The third, taken at the conclusion of the initiation by making a consciouspromise repeated after the master, is to assume [the pledges] never to forsakethe sacred doctrine, and so on, for which one guards against root downfallsand secondary infractions, as explained in conduct tantra’s own system.13STAGES IN THE PRACTICE OF THE PATH [v']This section has three parts: entering; approaching; and effecting powers.ENTERING [aa']There are two aspects of entering: the outer practice; and the inner practice."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CONDUCT TANTRA\u0002119OUTER ENTERING [1'']The outer practice of entering is as just explained: [receiving initiation andassuming the pledges].INNER ENTERING [2'']This section has two parts: with signs; and without signs.WITH SIGNS [a'']The inner entering with signs involves the six deities.For recitation and meditation on the two aspects of letter andbase, the deity is like a sibling or friend.The inner practice of entering has two aspects, with signs and without signs.14Tibetan masters present a number of different perspectives on these twoand ways to identify them. According to the Venerable Taranata, practicewith signs consists of the meditations of the yoga of six deities with genera-tion of oneself as the deity and generation of the deity in front. The[Vajravidarana] Tantra states:15The yogin, having first bathed,Takes his place on the vajra mat,Then offers, prays, and meditates on six deities.Emptiness, letter, sound, form,Seal, and sign are said to be the six.Accordingly, once the outer and inner cleansing [rituals] have been per-formed, a circle of protection is imagined, the pristine awareness deitiesinvited, hand mudras exhibited, and then offerings and petitions made.16That is followed by meditation on the authentic condition [of things], knownas the deity as emptiness; then, in sequence, meditation on the syllables ofthe mantra and on the seed [syllable], known as the deity as letter; medita-tion on the sound of the mantra along with its light, which radiates forthand reconverges, known as the deity as sound; meditation on the body ofthe deity, known as the deity as form; meditation on the insignia, and soforth, at the heart [of the deity], known as the deity as seal; and meditationon one’s own body, blessed by mantra, as being the body of the deity, known"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"120\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAas the deity as sign. [These steps] represent the general meditation using thesix deities.For the special meditation, the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra states17that the deity to be meditated upon comprises three deities: the deity asletter, as seal, and as form. Each is divided into two aspects. The two aspectsof the deity as letter are the deity as awakening mind and the deity as sound.The two aspects of the deity as seal are the deity depicted in a form andshape, such as the wheel [of the doctrine]; and the deity without form orshape, emptiness, symbolized by the azure [triangular] source of phenom-ena.18 The two aspects of the deity as form are the deity as utterly pure formand the deity as impure form. The deity as utterly pure form is the veryessence of realization in which all conceptual characteristics are totally paci-fied, a direct experience of the essence of enlightenment by one’s intrinsicself-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature]. The deity asimpure form is meditation on [the deity as] a form that has color, face,hands, and so forth, by means of conceptual thought.Based on understanding [of the deity] in that way, the stages of medita-tion in the yoga with signs [as explained in the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra]are practiced. As preliminary steps, one performs [the rituals] of protectingoneself, the place, and the yoga.19 Following these is meditation on [the twoaspects of ] the deity as letter. For the first aspect of the deity as letter, therelative manifestation of ultimate awakening mind is visualized as a moondisk. For the second aspect of the deity as letter, [the syllables of ] the man-tra to be recited, which are standing on the moon disk, are imagined to beresonating with their sounds.Next is meditation on the [deity as] base. For the first aspect, the [sub-jective] base, one imagines that the utterly pure nature of everything [syl-lables and moon] is oneself as the deity, and one performs blessings withmantras, mudras, and so on. For the second aspect, the [objective] base,one visualizes the deity in front, which manifests from oneself as the deitylike a reflection in a mirror. Then, one focuses on [the syllables of ] themantra on the moon disk at the heart of the deity in front and retains thelife [wind]. With single-minded application, one mentally recites the man-tra, training [in this way] until an experience of vivid appearance occurs.Throughout this phase, one regards [the relationship between] the deityand oneself to be simply like that of siblings or friends.Ngorchen Dorjé Chang20 and others, taking the Vairochanabhisambodhias an example, present [the two practices in this way]: The practice withsigns, explained in accordance with the Sadhana [of Vairochana],21 includes"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"CONDUCT TANTRA\u0002121the generation on the ground of the mandala of the reflected form [i.e., thedeity in front] along with its “life” [i.e., the moon and mantra] on the basisof an external mandala, and the imagining of the ultimate mandala [of thewisdom deities] in the sky, and so on. Practice without signs has both real andnominal [aspects]. The real aspect consists of training in the union of empti-ness (freedom from concepts) and compassion. The nominal aspect includesthe generation of the deity in its two aspects as letter and the two bases, theperformance of the mental recitation while retaining the life wind, and so on.WITHOUT SIGNS [b'']Practice without signs is cultivated in conjunction with theminds of entering, abiding, and emerging.The common yoga without signs includes contemplation of [the deity’s]insignia and syllable at the heart of the deity; blocking the life wind; and theuse in the path of [sexual] desire [related to] the laughter of the male andfemale deities, and so on.22The special yoga without signs is cultivated in conjunction with threeminds: the minds of entering, abiding, and emerging, the essence of whichis the ultimate awakening mind itself. The mind of entering is the realiza-tion of the unborn nature of all phenomena (the aggregates, etc.) gained byexamining them in terms of the four extremes;23 the mind of abiding, thedirect realization of the unborn nature as the essence of the nonconceptualstate; and the mind of emerging, the ensuing great compassion directed to-ward suffering beings who lack such realization.Proficiency in those two kinds of yogas, with and without signs, pro-duces resultant powers which are also of two kinds: by means of the formerare attained powers with signs [i.e., the form dimensions of awakening];and by means of the latter, both powers with signs and without signs [i.e.,the reality dimension and the form dimensions of awakening]. Accordingly,the Vairochanabhisambodhi states:24The sublime Victor declared that [yoga] with signsBrings about powers with signs.But persevering in the signless [yoga]Also leads to powers with signs;Since that is the case,Adhere to the signless in all ways."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAPPROACHING [bb']The practice of approaching is to become skilled in practicewith and without signs.The common practice of approaching has two aspects: with signs and with-out signs. The first has two aspects, the outer and the inner.The outer practice with signs is to familiarize oneself with the deity bymeans of the four-branched recitation [as explained in the entering prac-tice] in conjunction with the retention of the life wind, until one has com-pleted the recitation of the requisite number [of mantras], one hundredthousand, or however many are prescribed.The inner practice with signs is to clearly imagine oneself as BuddhaShakyamuni, at whose heart is a moon disk on which is [the form of ]Vairochana. In the heart of Vairochana on a moon disk is the arrangement[of the syllables] of the mantra. Retaining the life wind, one does the recita-tion [as before].25The practice without signs is to thoroughly analyze the very nature ofthe color and other features of the deity’s form (which is inseparable fromoneself ) by breaking down these imagined appearances into their most subtleparticles. In accordance with what one has thereby realized, one experiencesmind as simply self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature],released of oneself as the form of the deity, devoid of [dualistic] appear-ances. Then, one mentally recites [the mantra] as appropriate. (This de-scription of the practice without signs accords with that given by somelearned masters.26 Essentially, it is contained in the yoga without signs ex-plained above, and therefore many would not consider it a separate part ofthis topic.)EFFECTING POWERS [cc']The practice to effect powers uses outer and inner mandalas forordinary and special powersThrough which one becomes an awareness-holder of the desireor form realm. ...After perfecting familiarization with the deity, one engages in practices toeffect powers. By relying on outer and inner mandalas, one gains ordinaryand special powers in the following ways:"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"CONDUCT TANTRA\u0002123For the ordinary powers, one draws the outer mandala used to effectpowers, places within it a sword or other ritual object [such as noose, wheel,iron arrow, or hammer], and then recites [the given numbers of mantras].When the object blazes [with light] and one grasps it in one’s hand, oneattains the state of awareness-holder (or another power).For the special powers, one relies on the inner mandalas of the fourelements [visualized within the body]27 and thereby gains proficiency inbreath control. This effects inner powers which depend on the mind alone,the five supernormal cognitive powers such as that of performing miracles,28and the powers to greatly effect the welfare of oneself and others, plusaccompanying powers, accrued from having entered the ranks of aware-ness-holders.According to this tantra, the supreme state [of awakening] can be at-tained through the use of articles as an awareness-holder [whose status is]equal in fortune to the gods of the realm of desire and form up to thehighest gods of Unsurpassed;29 through a body purified of its coarse ele-ments (aggregates, etc.) and endowed with the eight qualities of physicallordliness, subtle [form], and so on; through the [mental body] support inthe intermediate state [between lives]; and through experience in a futurelife.THE WAY TO EFFECT POWERS [vi']The way to effect powers is included in the above discussion and will not beelaborated on separately. Regarding this, Venerable [Taranata] of Jonangspeaks of four practices: the practice of entering, which is initiation andpledges; the practice of yoga, which is familiarization [with the deity] bymeans of the two yogas [with and without signs]; the practice to effectpowers in which, having gained stability in the focus of meditation, theyogin makes offerings to a drawn representation of the deity or a constructedmandala and then practices [to attain powers], as a result of which he expe-riences a vision of the deity in the waking state or in dream [who conferspower]; and the practice to effect great powers, which includes practicesrelated to the sets of activations and powers as explained in the individualtantras.While cultivating these four, a practitioner must maintain purity andcleanliness. However, except for special purposes, to undergo the rigors ofasceticism is not necessary since [in conduct tantra] one is required to medi-tate on oneself as the deity."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRASTAGES OF AWAKENING, PATHS, AND RESULT [vii']...

These [ten] dispositions, which when subdivided includeone hundred and sixty dispositions, constitute what is taught as the mun-dane path leading to the result of higher rebirth.31On the supramundane path, a person of low faculties will take six greataeons to progress through the stages associated with the different degrees ofrealization of the two [aspects of ] no-self32 and enter the stage of “practicewith appreciation of the universal way.” A person of sharp faculties will takeone aeon to enter [the same stage]. This stage represents the great level ofthe path of accumulation in this system.33Subsequent to that, by means of the three minds of entering, abiding,and emerging, in one aeon [one reaches] the stage of pristine awareness,which is the culmination of the ten stages of “practice with appreciation.”34At that point, one receives oceans of teachings from oceans of buddhas, where-upon one realizes the pristine awareness of [the stage] “conducive to definitiveseparation.”35 One moves through the stages of awakening, the first, and soon, and upon reaching the end of the tenth stage, becomes a buddha bycontemplating the five [seed] syllables of the great hero as the very essence ofrealization.36 It is said that the stage of omniscience, the great enjoymentdimension of full awakening,37 will definitely be reached by a person of lowfaculties in eight aeons at the most, and by one of sharp faculties, despitehindrances of any kind, in three great aeons.This [progression through stages] is designated by Ngorchen and othersas “practice to effect [powers].” According to their view, having once at-tained the state of awareness-holder of the sword by means of practice to"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"CONDUCT TANTRA\u0002125effect powers, in that [same] body of an awareness-holder, one engages indeeds of excellence such as moving throughout oceans of buddha realms.As a result, the state of Great Vairochana is realized."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"YOGA TANTRA\u00021275.

It serves as themanifestation ground of all the deities, mantras, and seals, being the essen-tial reality of one’s own mind, utterly pure from the beginning of time.The fourth, the means whereby the result is achieved, comprises thefollowing yogas: the yoga of the great seal of awakened body which serves todispel the adventitious deceptions of the ground-of-all consciousness andthereby to actualize its nature, mirror-like pristine awareness; the yoga ofthe pledge seal of awakened mind, to dispel the adventitious deceptions ofafflicted consciousness and thereby to actualize its nature, the pristine aware-ness of total sameness; the yoga of the doctrine seal of awakened speech, todispel the adventitious deceptions of mental consciousness and thereby toactualize its nature, discerning pristine awareness; and the yoga of the ac-tion seal of awakened activity,23 to dispel the adventitious deceptions of thefive sense consciousnesses24 and thereby to actualize their natures, the pris-tine awareness of accomplishment.

These events applied as formsof yoga by later followers [of the Buddha] [constitute the three contempla-tions of ] the initial union, supremely triumphant mandala, and supremelytriumphant act.29Since a person of low faculties would be unable to practice the threecontemplations, he or she should practice the meditations of the four yogas:the yoga of generating oneself as the pledge deity of one’s family; the subse-quent yoga of merging the pristine awareness deity with the pledge deityand experiencing this [union] as one flavor; the all-inclusive yoga of medi-tation on this [union] as the very nature of the animate and inanimateworld; and upon completion of the first three yogas, the supreme yoga inwhich the state of single-minded contemplation is attained. These contem-plations are called “attention on the coarse [form of the] deity.”Once a practitioner has cultivated deity yoga by means of the three contem-plations or the four yogas, whichever appropriate, he or she engages in what iscalled “attention on the minute insignia of the deity,” explained as follows:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"YOGA TANTRA\u0002135With the tongue positioned against the palate, one visualizes at the navela minute five-pronged vajra no larger than a hair’s tip or a sesame seed, thesame color as the deity. One imagines that this vajra exits through the nos-trils and stands erect on the tip of the nose.30 One’s mind then remains fixedon the vajra by means of both mindfulness and vigilance. When concentra-tion has become stable, a distinct sensation of bliss will arise at the tip of thenose or in other parts of the body. As a result, one will achieve great service-ability of body and mind.31Once concentration on the features of the minute vajra has become stable,one imagines that many minute vajras emanate forth and pervade every-thing from the inside and surroundings of one’s body to all parts of theuniverse. Finally, one draws in all these emanated [vajras], from the tip ofthe nose and into the heart. This meditation yields great benefits, such asachievement of the special contemplation of mental quiescence.These forms of yoga are trained in and brought to realization throughthe methods of the ten essential principles [of tantric expertise]:The two mandalas (form and formless)... fire-offering rituals (in-ner and outer); dissolution; and the request for departure.This passage refers to the following ten: the mandala, which is twofold, thatof reflected images [i.e., with form] and the formless one;32 mantra, outerand inner; four seals [the great seal, pledge seal, doctrine seal, and actionseal] applied to the deities; [rituals of ] protection of oneself, the place, andthe yoga; the invitation that gathers the pristine awareness deities; [whis-pered] recitation of vajra words and mental recitation of mantra; medita-tion comprising the three contemplations, and so forth; fire-offering rituals,both outer and inner, performed for the sake of mandala worship or otherpurposes; dissolution, which is the release of the seals [to interrupt the con-templation of oneself as the deity]; and request for the [deity’s] departureafter making offerings.WITHOUT SIGNS [b'']Perfect penetrating wisdom is the view of the unborn.The Summation of Essential Principles states:33With an understanding of the syllable aOne meditates on the forms of all syllables."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"136\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThrough meditation from one’s mouth to another’s,One comes to attain the powers.The meaning of the syllable a in this citation is understood to be the unborn[nature].

Furthermore, the same tantra states:35That which is called perfect penetrating wisdomIs known to be contemplation.The seals should be practiced in that state:Meditation [in this way] brings rapid success.The perfect penetrating wisdom spoken of in this citation is the view of theunborn [nature]; it denotes contemplative equanimity in a state withoutany concept whatsoever, based on knowledge of the lack of intrinsic natureof things.The Indestructible Peak presents extensive teachings on the forms ofsignless meditations in the transcendent family, vajra family, and the otherfamilies, for which is emphasized analytical insight by means of discerningwisdom. [The signless yoga] taught in the Summation of Essential Principles,on the other hand, comprises both mental quiescence and insight. Medita-tion in which mental quiescence and insight are alternated depending onconditions of mental agitation, fogginess, and other [impediments] thatarise in practice is taught in [Shakyamitra’s] Ornament of Kosala.36THE STAGE OF EFFECTING POWERS [bb']This discussion will form part of the following section.THE PROCESS OF EFFECTING POWERS [vi']Powers and the pristine awareness of the seals are effectedThrough meditative absorption, recitation, and fire-offeringrituals."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"YOGA TANTRA\u0002137There are three [methods] in the process of effecting powers: reliance onmeditative absorption, which brings about mainly supramundane powers;recitation of the mantra, effecting both [mundane and supramundane] pow-ers; and fire-offering rituals, effecting mainly mundane powers. The ulti-mate result of all [three] is attainment of the supreme [power]: pristineawareness of the seals [of awakened body, speech, mind, and activities].MEDITATIVE ABSORPTION [aa']Having completed familiarization, one applies oneself to the practice ofeffecting powers [with understanding] of the utter purity [emptiness] of thethree spheres [meditator, meditation, and object meditated upon]. Subse-quently, one cultivates the seals [of awakened body, speech, mind, and ac-tivities] for the benefit of others and attends to the infinite activationsassociated with those [four] seals, thereby experiencing [favorable] signsand developing supernormal cognitive powers. Having succeeded in that,one effects powers through collective practice37 according to the procedureset out in the subsequent-practice section of the Glorious Supreme OriginalBeing Tantra.38 If this does not lead to success, the practice must be repeatedseven times. If success is still not forthcoming, one relies on the enhance-ment practice called “the rite of killing the deity.”39 These instructions areintended for the person of sharp faculties.The general familiarization and the special contemplation of the minutevajra are intended for someone of low faculties and for practitioners in com-mon. Once those are mastered, one engages in the various special medita-tive absorptions taught [in this tantra] and thereby attains ordinary powers,such as the skill [to find] treasure [underground], walk on water, possess[the knowledge] of awareness mantras and so forth; and the supreme power[attainment of awakening].MANTRA RECITATION [bb']Powers are effected through two types of recitation, vajra [mental] recita-tion and word [whispered] recitation. A person of sharp faculties relies onvajra recitation of two forms: the relative, for which there is a focus; and theultimate, which is without focus.For the relative vajra recitation with focus, one first cultivates the vividappearance of the deity in front and oneself as the deity. Having drawn inthe wind and sense powers, one [mentally] recites the mantra while recol-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAlecting its meaning. Then, while exhaling and right until the end of theexhalation, one continues reciting the mantra, observing the deity in front.Again, one [inhales], blocking the life wind, thoughts, and senses; focuseson the form of the deity which is undifferentiated from oneself; and contin-ues the [mental] recitation of the mantra.For the ultimate vajra recitation with no focus, first one meditates on theunborn [nature] of the deity in front, oneself [as the deity], and the mantra,and considers everything to be emptiness. While blocking [the movementof ] the life [wind], with a mind free from grasping to anything at all, oneregards the deity, oneself, and the mantra as being [empty] like the sky andmentally recites the mantra with attention on the reality dimension of thedeity. When releasing the breath, one brings to mind the form [of the deityendowed] with its attributes. Again, one [inhales,] drawing in the life [wind],and so on. Thus, one continues the mental recitation, alternating betweenthose two modes.Persons of low faculties effect powers through the recitation of words.With one’s legs in the position particular to the deity of one’s family, onemeditates on the deity in front and oneself [as the deity]. With the left handin a fist [position appropriate to] the family, one holds the insignia of thefamily. With the right hand, one holds at the heart the family’s chaplet (forcounting numbers of mantras). One recites the mantra for a period of fourmonths in a style particular to the family (silently in the case of the tran-scendent family [of Vairochana], and so on.) When that is completed, onerecites the mantra for another four months, four sessions a day, in front of arepresentation of one’s deity. At the conclusion [of the four months], oneexerts oneself fervently in the recitation for the entirety of one night. It istaught that as a result, at daybreak, one gains powers from the representa-tion of one’s deity.In these ways, a practitioner effects the supreme power [awakening], aswell as the mundane powers associated with external articles, [the state of ]sky-farer awareness-holder, and so on. The former (supreme) is the power[accrued] mainly through vajra recitation; the latter (mundane), the powers[accrued] mainly through word recitation. However, the powers effected byword recitation eventually lead to the supramundane power.FIRE-OFFERING RITUALS [cc']On the particular fire-platform appropriate for the purpose (purification ofnegativities, enhancement of the [family and spiritual] lineage, or other"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"YOGA TANTRA\u0002139purpose), one performs the fire-offering ritual40 every day preceded by thedeity yoga. This is continued until signs indicating success (in, for example,purification of negativities) have manifested to oneself or to another. Then,one performs each of the [four] activations [appeasement, enrichment, domi-nation, and the fierce form]. [In addition to] these explanations of variousprocedures to effect powers, the use in the path of the bliss derived from[the male and female] holding hands is also found in this tantra.STAGES OF AWAKENING, PATHS, AND RESULT [vii']One of sharp faculties swiftly crosses the stages and paths in onelifetime;And one of low faculties, in sixteen or less. The culmination ofthe five awakeningsIs perfect enlightenment, in essence the five pristine awarenesses.Once the path of this [tantra] has been entered, a person of sharp facultiesis said to traverse all the stages and paths of yoga tantra within one lifetime,while one of low faculties does so in up to sixteen lifetimes. Thus, in com-parison to the previous [tantras], the time one takes is extremely brief.To expand, at the tenth stage of awakening, a practitioner, whether ofsharp or low faculties, will receive the initiation of great light [from all thebuddhas], and thereupon practice the contemplation that is the perfect endof the fourth meditative absorption.41 One who has attained such absorp-tion is known as “one endowed with a mental body,”42 “a bodhisattva in thelast existence,” and “a bodhisattva accomplisher of all intentions” since [atthat stage] to accomplish all of one’s [intended] deeds depends merely uponone’s wish to do so.Such an “accomplisher of all intentions” attains enlightenment in therealm of Unsurpassed [called] Richly Adorned, doing so in the followingway: Dwelling in the heart of awakening,43 through the force of havingactualized the mind of unsurpassable awakening, one remains in equanim-ity in the unstirring contemplation possessed of six qualities.44 At that time,all the transcendent ones of the ten directions arouse one from that con-templation and impart the instructions on the five awakenings.45 There-upon, by contemplating these five awakenings [in sequence], one attainsperfect awakening, in essence the five pristine awarenesses.46This state of enlightenment possesses the characteristics of the three di-mensions of awakening: the reality dimension, in flavor identical to the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAfour pristine awarenesses, in essence the pristine awareness of the ultimatedimension of phenomena; the enjoyment dimension in its major aspect,the manifestation in the Great Unsurpassed Realm as form endowed withfive certainties, and the enjoyment dimension in its minor aspect, which, asthe all-powerful sovereign, emanates the mandala, teaches [yoga tantra],and so forth, on the summit of Mount Meru and at other locations; and themanifest dimension which demonstrates the twelve deeds,47 such as dwell-ing in the Joyful Realm, and so forth.Thus, although [traversing the stages and paths in] yoga tantra does takea long time, ultimate buddhahood will be achieved within one minor aeon."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"HIGHEST YOGA TANTRA\u0002141 6.

This is substantiated by the following passage from the KalachakraRoot Tantra:Yoga is not composed of method alone,Nor is it exclusively wisdom........."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe Transcendent One taught yogaAs the union of method and wisdom.and this statement in the Commentary on the Indestructible Tent:1That which is known as “highest of all tantras” is the highest yogatantra because it surpasses action, conduct, and yoga tantras.The essence of highest yoga tantra is as described in the Compendium [onthe Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra]:2In the midst of an entourage of queens, in the form of an all-powerful sovereign, and by means of the contemplation of greatbliss, to dwell perfectly in the bhaga of the queen; to train in accor-dance with sublime vajra words, the statements of six parameters,contrary to worldly customs; and to practice [deity yoga] to effectthe objects of practice [(i.e., powers)]: these apply to great yogatantra.To clarify this passage, the following elements are said to apply to, or becontained within, highest (great) yoga tantra: In the midst of an entourageof queens, in the form of an all-powerful sovereign such as Heruka (inmother tantra) or Vairochana (in father tantra);3 and by means of the con-templation of the great bliss of the male and female [deities’] union, to bethe “king who resides in the castle” (as is said in the tantras), which meansto dwell perfectly in the queen’s bhaga,4 that is, in the divine palace in thesource of phenomena; to train according to the sublime vajra words,5 thestatements of six parameters—interpretable, non-interpretable, provisional,definitive, standard, and coined terminology6—which are contrary to worldlyhuman customs (as is said in the tantras, “Success is rapidly achieved byrelying on one’s mother, sister, or daughter”7) by performing extremely baseacts; and thereby to effect ordinary and supreme powers.ASCERTAINMENT OF THE MEANING OF THIS TANTRA [ii']This section has four parts: a concise presentation of its composition; themeans of realizing the three continuums; a very detailed presentation ofeach of the continuums; and a synopsis of this system’s view, meditation,conduct, and result."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"HIGHEST YOGA TANTRA\u0002143A CONCISE PRESENTATION OF ITS COMPOSITION [aa']The meaning of the tantra is contained in the threecontinuums.There seem to be a few ways of condensing the meaning of the highest yogatantra from the perspectives of the different sets of tantra and individualmasters. Of these, the main one is as found in the Continuation of theGuhyasamaja Tantra:8Tantra denotes continuousness.It is composed of three aspects:Ground, nature, and inalienableness.When distinguished in this way,The nature aspect is the cause;The ground aspect refers to the method;And inalienableness, the result.These three contain tantra’s meaning.Since [this tantra’s] composition of three continuums is widely known, itwill be presented according to that format.The term “tantra” [“continuum”] denotes the mind of awakening, Ever-Perfect (Samantabhadra), which has neither beginning nor end, in natureluminous clarity. It is “continuous” since, from time without beginning upto the attainment of enlightenment, it has always been present without anyinterruption.Tantra has “three [aspects]”: the “nature” or causal continuum, from theperspective of being the fundamental cause [for awakening]; “ground” orcontinuum of method, from the perspective of being the contributory con-dition [for awakening]; and “inalienableness” or resultant continuum, fromthe perspective of being the awakening that is the perfect fulfillment of thetwo goals [of one’s own and others’ welfare].9The meaning of this alone is of crucial importance in understanding thistantra and will therefore be explained here in a concise form.THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM [1'']The causal continuum denotes the natural condition of mind from thelevel of a sentient being to the state of a buddha, which abides, like the sky,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"144\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAwithout ever changing. There are any number of expressions for this, suchas “nature,” “essence of enlightenment,” and “naturally present affinity,”found in the sutras; and “essential principle of oneself,” “awakening mind,”and “mind of Ever-Perfect,” found in the lower tantras. In this system ofhighest yoga tantra, however, the causal continuum may be explained inconjunction with the meaning of the union of e and vam.The natural condition of the mind is possessed of three features: remain-ing unchanged from the level of a sentient being until the state of a buddha;being an inner knowing, whose characteristic nature is one’s intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature];10 and being su-preme immutable great bliss. This natural condition itself, called by variousnames such as “reality as it is,” “causal Vajradhara,” “original buddha,” andso forth, is represented by the syllable vam.That reality, owing to the crucial fact of being the mind which is the verynature of things, presents itself with form or appearance.11 In the impurestate, its appearance manifests as the aggregates and other constituents ofan ordinary being in cyclic existence. In the both-pure-and-impure state, itarises as the infinite visions of the contemplation of a yogin. In the utterlypure state,12 it appears in the form of a wheel of inexhaustible ornaments ofthe body, speech, and mind of a buddha. That which has the nature of thesemanifold forms is called “emptiness endowed with the supreme of all as-pects,” or “totality of forms,” “totality of faculties,” and so forth, and isrepresented by the syllable e.The union of what is represented by e and by vam is referred to as the“causal continuum,” “cause” in terms of being the fundamental stuff ofawakening and “continuum,” because it exists from time without begin-ning as the nature of the mind and continues from the level of a sentientbeing until the state of a buddha. [Maitreya’s] Jewel Affinity states:13From beginningless time, unfetteredBy the shell of beings’ emotions,The nature of mind is stainlessAnd is said to have no beginning. Another reference to “nature” is found in [Nagarjuna’s] FundamentalVerses Called Wisdom:14The nature is pure and unmodifiedAnd does not depend on anything else."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"HIGHEST YOGA TANTRA\u0002145As stated here, the nature is not something created anew by causes and condi-tions or some reification but is the authentic condition of mind’s very essence.THE CONTINUUM OF THE GROUND OR METHOD [2'']In a broad sense, the term “ground” refers to all possible aspects of the pathwhich allow one to progress from [first] awakening one’s affinity [for theuniversal way]15 until realization of the [fully] awakened state; and, in astrict sense, to the initiations which ripen one and the path which effectsliberation, along with all its branches. These aspects constitute the “ground”because they serve as the support for the attaining of and abiding in theresult, which is awakening, just as the earth provides the ground for thegrowth of new shoots.“Continuum” refers to the connectedness of all aspects of the path.The two powers (provisional and ultimate) are connected to the two phasesof the path [generation and completion]; the two phases, connected to thepledges and vows as their support; and the pledges and vows, connected toinitiations, which provide the entrance [to the highest yoga tantra].The term “method” is used because the path itself serves as the contribu-tory condition in the actualization of the result of awakening. Method in-cludes both the distant method and the close. The distant method comprisesall aspects of the path, from the three ways of the perfections [i.e., the waysof the proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas] up to and includingyoga tantra; and the close method, the two phases of the path of the greatyoga tantra, as well as the branches, which are practiced after having re-ceived the initiation.THE RESULTANT CONTINUUM [3'']The “resultant continuum” denotes becoming the foundation for others’welfare when the fundamental cause, freed from all adventitious stains, trans-forms into the state of full awakening as the dimension endowed with thetwo purities.16Such a foundation would deteriorate or be lost if the result [of awaken-ing] meant a state of temporary reversal of the obstacles caused byobscurations, or the perfect peace [that is the goal] of inferior [spiritualpursuits,] characterized as the cessation of the stream of consciousness.17This is not the case here, where the result means a permanent and continu-ous state, and is therefore referred to as “inalienableness.”"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAs long as space exists, there will be sentient beings, and as long as sen-tient beings exist, the awakened state continues without interruption. Theresult is therefore called “continuum” owing to its permanent character. It iscalled “result” since it is the final main goal yearned for by all bodhisattvaswho practice according to the method of mantra.The above discussion of the three continuums is based on [Abhayakara’s]elucidation in Awn of Esoteric Instructions.What follows now is an explanation of this subject that is very easily under-stood: All of the distinct appearances (such as environments, bodies, re-sources, [notions of ] time, perceptions, mentations, and conceptualconstructs) that are experienced by these [beings] widely known as “sen-tient beings of five classes”18 are produced by the inconceivable force ofactions perpetrated by each one of them. Like falling hairs seen by someonewith a cataract, these appearances are merely deceptive visions, which seemto be separate from oneself but in fact are not, arising due to the habitualtendencies of beginningless ignorance.Even at the very moment of the exuberance of these appearances, the groundof their manifestation, the mind which is by nature luminous clarity, is presentwithout the tarnish of the habitual tendencies [that create] deceptive vi-sions: This mind of luminous clarity is called the causal continuum.By means of the esoteric instructions of an authentic master, one devel-ops familiarity with [the understanding that] whatever appears is the veryessence of luminous clarity, with nothing to be eliminated or added. Alter-natively, persons incapable of that practice would cultivate the methodwhereby all appearances are freely enjoyed as the various displays of godsand goddesses within the limitlessly ornamented palace of the transcendentones. Having approached the pristine awareness of luminous clarity in ei-ther of those ways, one stabilizes the practice of familiarization with thispristine awareness [so that it is] continuous like the current of a river. Thisis called the continuum of the path.One develops continuous familiarization in that way, and at some point,although one’s mind manifests freely in the form of the entire range of theknowable, since the stains of deception have then been totally exhausted,dualistic impressions are absent, and the mind [is realized] as great pristineawareness of self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature],the very essence of the state of union19 free from all obscurations.As this state is undefiled by even the slightest concept, construct, orsubject and object duality, there manifests spontaneously the awakened ac-"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"HIGHEST YOGA TANTRA\u0002147tivity that completely and fortuitously fulfills all aspirations of sentient be-ings throughout the infinity of space, without partiality and in accordancewith their interests, intentions, and faculties. This awakened activity is calledthe resultant continuum.THE MEANS OF REALIZING THE THREE CONTINUUMS [bb']The causal continuum is to be understood by eliminatingmisconceptions through study and reflection.The continuum of method is to be relied upon throughexperience in meditation.The resultant continuum is to be realized through threeaccumulations.The causal continuum is to be understood, just as it is, once misconcep-tions [concerning reality] have been eliminated by means of the wisdomthat arises from broad and impartial study and undistorted reflection [onthe teachings].The continuum of method is to be relied upon in such a way that thesignificance of one’s study and reflection does not remain as mere intellec-tual understanding, but becomes a personal experience based on medita-tion attended by intense faith and effort.The resultant continuum is to be realized through having brought toperfection the three accumulations of merit, pristine awareness, and ethics."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM\u00021497.

However, the prevalent view on this subjecthas been mentioned above. Here, the causal continuum will be discussedaccording to the elucidation of Shantigupta, a heruka in this age of conflict,and his lineage:1Essence, principal nature, characteristics,Synonyms, attributes, temporal states, and immutability:These epitomize the causal continuum.Accordingly, the causal continuum is explained in seven points, the first ofwhich is its essence:ESSENCE [i'']The essence of the causal continuum refers to its aspects that ceaselesslyoccur from time without beginning, namely, that which is the luminousclarity nature of the mind; mind and mental events; the nature of the envi-ronment and inhabitants; the channels, winds, vital constituents, and theultimate dimension of phenomena.PRINCIPAL NATURE [ii'']The luminous clarity nature of the mind is the principal of the above aspects.Thus, it is considered here as a separate point with this name [principal nature].CHARACTERISTICS [iii'']Four distinctive features characterize the causal continuum: its close confor-mity to the attributes of the result [of buddhahood], such as buddha realms,the dimensions of awakening, and pristine awareness; its nature as great bliss;its uninterrupted flow; and its presence due to the very nature of reality.SYNONYMS [iv'']Its synonyms include terms such as continuum of cause, ground of purifica-tion, ground-of-all, and original buddha. Each of these has several distinctions."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM\u0002151“Cause” [in “continuum of cause”] comprises the following fourteencauses: the cause of emotional afflictions; the cause of karma; the cause ofthorough affliction (suffering), the environment, and the inhabitants; thecause of the path; the cause of emptiness, bliss, and their union; the cause ofthe coarse, the subtle, and the very subtle; the cause of the two form dimen-sions, and the cause of the reality dimension of awakening.“Ground” [in “ground of purification”] comprises the following fifteengrounds: the ground of the purity of the environment, the ground of thepurity of the inhabitants, the ground of the purity of offerings, the groundof the purity of the transformations, and the ground of the purity of theirnatures; the ground of cyclic existence, the ground of perfect peace, andthe ground of their natures; the ground of the partial, and the ground ofthe final; the ground of the relative, and the ground of the ultimate; theground of the coarse, the ground of the subtle, and the ground of the verysubtle.The first five, beginning with the purity of the environment, are distinc-tions in the basis of purification in terms of karmic actions and activities.The next three, beginning with the ground of cyclic existence, are distinc-tions in terms of liberation and bondage. The next two, the grounds of thepartial and the final, are distinctions in terms of what is nominal and whatis real. The next two, the grounds of the relative and the ultimate, are dis-tinctions in terms of substantial and designative existence. The last three aredistinctions in terms of the manner of realization.Moreover, the ground of the coarse comprises nine [aspects], distinguishedaccording to characteristics and types of persons. Sandalwood, utpala flower,lotus, red lotus, and jewel-like persons represent five distinctions based oncharacteristics.2 Differentiations in emotional afflictions, karma, physicaltraits, and family represent four distinctions based on types. These [lastfour] are conceptual designations applied to persons.The “ground-of-all”3 corresponds to the way it is explained in the con-text of the way of characteristics. The “original buddha” is twofold: theintrinsic original buddha and the sudden original buddha.4ATTRIBUTES [v'']The causal continuum is possessed of interrelated flaws and qualities, orcauses and results, [explained as follows]:In the causal continuum are obscurations of the four states (waking,dream, deep sleep, and sexual union) present as flaws or causes, together"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAwith qualities or results, which are the four joys and the four [stages ofexperience of ] light.5Similarly, that which has the meaning of evam maya,6 the four channel-wheels, as well as the four winds and four vital essences,7 are accompaniedby stains and dispersion,8 owing to which these are reified as the “four fami-lies,” “four tantras,” “four beings,” “four qualities,” “four periods,” and soon,9 and are present as flaws or causes. At the same time, four habitualtendencies generate four notions: the notion that everything truly exists,the notion that everything is subtle particles, the notion that everything ismind only, and the notion that not even the mind has true existence. Fromthese notions originate the views associated with the four [Buddhist] phi-losophies, the four [original Buddhist] schools, the four moments [of anact], the four joys, the four truths, and so on.10These views, along with the four seals,11 serve to purify stains. When a cer-tain degree of freedom from stains and absence of dispersion is achieved, bothflaws and qualities, or causes and results, come to be present mutually related.[As the very nature of the causal continuum is] perfectly realized just asit is, a total freedom from stains and absence of dispersion is achieved.Consequently, the causal continuum manifests solely as qualities and results,such as the four dimensions of awakening or the four indestructible states.12TEMPORAL STATES [vi'']There are five temporal states of the causal continuum: the state at whichthe [path] concordant with [the result of ] liberation has not yet been en-tered; that state at which it has been entered; the state on the path of anordinary person; the state on the path of training; and that on the path ofno more training. These five are called, respectively, original buddha, causalcontinuum, path-entered, exalted, and resultant Vajradhara.IMMUTABILITY [vii'']The immutability of the causal continuum refers to its essence, which re-mains unaffected when passing from a former to a later state. Thus, thecausal continuum is neither destroyed nor modified by birth, old age, sick-ness, death, migration, [twelve] links of dependent origination, logical in-vestigation, truths, absorption in the nonconceptual state, or the resultantindestructible contemplation.The causal continuum should be understood by means of these seven points."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u00021538.

The au-thentic condition is also called the “total seal at the ground stage,” “primor-dial reality,” “original lord,” “affinity for enlightenment,” and “essence ofenlightenment.” On that basis of division, there are two authentic condi-tions of things, that of the body and that of the mind, when distinguishedin terms of the way the authentic condition manifests.3DETAILED PRESENTATION [ii'']This section has three parts: the main topic, the authentic condition ofmind; the branch topic, the authentic condition of the body; and represen-tation [of the causal continuum] in evam and other symbols.THE MAIN TOPIC: THE AUTHENTIC CONDITION OF MIND [aa'']This is presented in two parts: the pure state, the essence of the authenticcondition; and the impure state, the manifestation of appearances based onthe condition of deception.THE PURE STATE: THE ESSENCE OF THE AUTHENTIC CONDITION[(1)]The causal continuum, the essence of enlightenment, is commonly knownas an “affinity.” This affinity seems to be described in a number of different"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u0002155ways by philosophers. Therefore, it is important to have at least a partialunderstanding of their views.Analysts maintain that the mental factor of detachment with regard toworldly life and worldly possessions, with few desires and an attitude ofcontentment, is the affinity of an exalted person.Traditionists consider affinity to be a mental seed, the potency that cangive rise to immaculate pristine awareness.Idealists or experientialists consider affinity to be the potency that gener-ates immaculate qualities, which has always been present in mind’s con-tinuum from time without beginning. This potency is asserted to exist dueto the very nature of reality.In the centrist tradition, there is agreement, for the most part, in assert-ing that the affinity is the true nature [of mind], just as it is, attended bystains. However, the different ways of identifying that true nature are ex-tremely numerous. This has given rise, here in Tibet, to arguments over thevarious distinct views [on the affinity], with a countless number of personsspeaking only nonsense.In the context of the indestructible way, the essence of enlightenment isdefined in different ways. The patriarchs of the magnificent Sakya [tradi-tion] explain that [the essence of enlightenment] is mind’s nature, whichis intrinsically pure. They state that although the qualities [of enlighten-ment] are not actually manifest in that essence, they are nevertheless in-herently present as seeds. When the result [of enlightenment] is actualizedby means of the contributory factors of the two accumulations [merit andwisdom] or practice of the two phases [generation and completion], thequalities of enlightenment are attained through a transformation of thoseseeds.The great omniscient one of Jomonang4 [distinguishes two types of af-finity], the naturally present and the evolving. He maintains that the natu-rally present affinity endowed with the thirty-two qualities of the realitydimension of awakening5 is present in all sentient beings as a naturalattribute and has always been since the beginning of time. This affinity isa real buddha that is concealed in adventitious stains. The evolving affin-ity, on the other hand, is acquired anew, generated through the contribu-tory factors of propensities developed in hearing the teachings, and soforth.The outstanding Tibetan master Sangwé Jin [Bodong Choklé Namgyal]6describes affinity as the most refined essence of body, speech, and mind,known as “the indestructible refined essence possessed of three features.”"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRALord Tsongkapa and his followers explain affinity in terms of negationonly, as the “emptiness of mind being devoid of true existence.”The magnificent [Third Karmapa] Rangjung Dorjé maintains that theessence of enlightenment is ordinary awareness itself,7 which transcendsdefinition and conceptual characteristics. It is, in nature, the indivisibilityof pristine awareness and the ultimate dimension of phenomena; like themoon’s reflection on water, it is neither true nor false.8The omniscient Longchenpa makes the following statement in his Com-mentary on the Wish-Fulfilling Treasury:That which is primordially uncompounded, the pristine aware-ness that is one’s intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizesits own nature], ineffable emptiness and clarity: this is the essenceof enlightenment. The Jewel Affinity says:9As it was, so it shall be:It is the unchanging nature of reality.Explanations on the part of followers of these masters are given solely inaccordance with the above traditions, apart from minor degrees of refine-ment in their presentations.This concludes an overview of the ways of defining the causal continuum.What follows now is the main discussion, which has two parts: the com-mon explanation in accordance with the way of the perfections; and anuncommon one enhanced by a special feature in the system of highest yogatantra.THE COMMON EXPLANATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WAY OF THEPERFECTIONS [(a)]The luminous clarity nature of mind is the naturally presentaffinityWith three features. The evolving affinity is perfectly acquired.As illustrated by nine examples, the essence is concealed byadventitious stains.Mind’s nature, which is undifferentiable from the sixty-four qualities ofenlightenment,10 is intrinsically pure, in itself luminous clarity, the empti-"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u0002157ness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena. This nature of mind, re-ferred to as the “naturally present affinity,” is the ground of everything inboth cyclic life and perfect peace. It is described as having three distinguish-ing features: its arisal in a continuous stream from time without beginning;its presence due to the very nature of reality; and its resemblance to the sixsuperior sense fields.The first feature indicates that since this affinity has arisen continuouslysince beginningless time, it is not one that is acquired anew.The second feature indicates that the affinity is present, with no distinc-tions, in every sentient being, as the very nature of reality.The third feature indicates that the affinity bears seeds that are virtuallyidentical, and equal in fortune, to the six immaculate sense fields [of abuddha] inherent in the six sense fields of a sentient being.11 The perfectly acquired evolving affinity, according to the omniscientone of Jonang, is one that has not existed previously, but arises anew.Rangjung Dorjé describes this affinity as the mind’s nature, which is intrin-sically pure, undifferentiable from the emptiness of the ultimate dimensionof phenomena. Being the stainless essence of the eightfold group ofconsciousnesses,12 it exists as the nature of the four pristine awarenesses.[The evolving affinity is so called] because it is an affinity that serves as thebase from which evolve the two form dimensions of awakening.What this means is that as a result of having perfectly developed whole-some qualities, the stain of not recognizing the very essence of the eightfoldgroup of consciousnesses is overcome. The eightfold group of consciousnessesare thereby liberated as self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its ownnature]. When this occurs—[a process] called “transformation of the eight-fold group of consciousnesses into the four pristine awarenesses”—the pris-tine awarenesses appear to others’ perception as the form dimensions ofawakening.Expressed concisely, the victorious Rangjung Dorjé and others [define]the nature of mind attended by stains [in this way]: Its unborn essence isthe naturally present affinity, and its unimpeded nature, the evolving affin-ity. Hence, mind’s nature attended by stains is called the “union of the twodimensions of awakening [formless and form] attended by stains.” As forthe nature of mind purified of stains, its unborn essence is the reality di-mension of awakening, which serves one’s own welfare, and its unimpedednature manifests as the form dimension, which serves others’ welfare. Hence,the nature of mind cleansed of stains is called the “union of the two dimen-sions of awakening devoid of stains.”"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"158\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe continuum of the ground, or essence of enlightenment, as has justbeen described, pervades the minds of all embodied beings. It is, however,concealed by adventitious stains (as elucidated in the Jewel Affinity usingnine metaphors). As is said:Not seeing what is; seeing what is not.Thus, there [arises] deception which misapprehends the essence. [Whatfollows now is an explanation of ] the stains that conceal the essence ofenlightenment, illustrated by nine metaphors.The stains present in the mind of a mere sentient being who has not yetentered the path are the [karmic traces of ] wholesome and unwholesomeactions which serve solely as the cause of cyclic existence. These stains, char-acterized by strong or rough mental states, are of four types—attachment,aversion, delusion, and the three mixed in equal proportions—and are il-lustrated by four metaphors, that of a lotus, [a swarm of ] honeybees, ahusk, and a swamp.The habitual tendencies of ignorance present in the mind of an arhat,either a proclaimer or solitary sage, are the obscurations that conceal theessence of enlightenment. The nature [of these stains] is illustrated by themetaphor of the earth covering a treasure buried below [the dwelling of ] apauper.The stains to be forsaken on the path of seeing in the universal waywhich are present in the mind of an ordinary person13 who is training [onthe path] are illustrated by the metaphor of [a shoot’s] skins.The stains to be forsaken on the [universal way’s] path of meditationwhich are [still] present in the mind of an exalted being [who has attainedthe path of seeing] are illustrated by the metaphor of an old rag.Of the stains [to be forsaken] on the ten stages of awakening which arepresent in beings who dwell on those stages, stains that apply to the firstseven impure stages are illustrated by the metaphor of a womb, and thosethat apply to the three pure stages, by the metaphor of a clay mold holdinga golden image.The essence [of enlightenment] in each of the above cases is illustratedby the metaphors, respectively, of a buddha concealed in the hollow of alotus; honey [guarded] by honeybees; a kernel within its husk; gold in aswamp; treasure buried in the earth; a shoot in its skins; a buddha statuewrapped in an old rag; a [future] ruler [still] in the womb; and a goldenimage [still] in its clay mold.14"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u0002159Its essence is unchanged throughout the three statesOf the impure, both pure and impure, and utterly pure.When the essence of enlightenment is thoroughly impure due to adventi-tious stains, it is designated “sentient being.” When it is possessed of boththe pure and the impure, it is called “bodhisattva dwelling on the path.”When it is utterly pure, it is called “transcendent one.”To explain, the impure state denotes that state of being subject to cyclicexistence created by karmic actions and emotional afflictions. The bodhisattvastate denotes the state at which there is freedom from karma and emotionalafflictions but not yet freedom from the level of the habitual tendencies ofignorance. The state of a transcendent one denotes the state at which thereis freedom from karma and emotional afflictions as well as freedom fromthe habitual tendencies of ignorance.These three temporal states [of the essence of enlightenment] are as-serted from the perspective of relative deception, while the essence of en-lightenment itself, in being the nature of the ultimate dimension of reality,never changes.It exists from time without beginning as the source of allphenomena,But is difficult to fathom, entwined by four paradoxes.The [Mahayana] Phenomenology Scripture states:15The dimension with no beginning in timeIs the abode of all phenomena.Owing to its being, cyclic lifeAnd perfect peace are experienced.Accordingly, that known as the “essence of enlightenment” has been presentsince time without beginning and serves as the basis upon which phenom-ena of cyclic life and perfect peace are conceived as deception or liberation.This essence is extremely difficult to fathom by anyone other than a buddha.Because it is entwined by four paradoxes, it is said to be taught to bodhisattvasof exceptionally sharp faculties. The Jewel Affinity states the four paradoxesin the following way:16Because it is pure, yet possessed of emotional afflictions,Because it is without thorough affliction, yet [regains] purity,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRABecause it has no disparity, yet [attains] qualities,Because it is spontaneous, yet without concepts....To expand, the true nature [of the essence of enlightenment] attended bystains is, at exactly the same time, utterly pure, and yet attended by thestains of thorough affliction. This paradox signifies its nature.The true nature [of the essence of enlightenment] free from stains hasnever in the past been sullied by the stains that produce thorough affliction,and yet through the subsequent cultivation of the path, it regains its purity.This paradox signifies its awakening.The essence of enlightenment is possessed of the stainless qualities of abuddha, such as the ten powers, as its very nature for which there is nodisparity [even] in the state of an ordinary being; hence, it does not differ inthis respect from a previous phase to a later one. Nonetheless, through thesubsequent clearing away of stains, it attains these qualities anew. This para-dox signifies its qualities.The essence of enlightenment is the activity of a buddha, effortlessly andspontaneously fulfilling the hopes and objectives of those to be guided, inaccordance with their individual good fortunes. Nonetheless, it is not sub-ject to conceptuality such as resolving to do one thing or another. Thisparadox signifies its activity.The intrinsically pure nature of the essence of enlightenment is the sourceto be realized and the base to be purified. Awakening is the very essence ofthe realization of one’s intrinsically pure nature and the qualities that arethe result arising from that realization. Awakened activity in various formsis the means through which this nature comes to be realized by others.These last three—realization, qualities, and activity—function as purificatoryfactors. From the base and those [three] factors arises the result, the ThreeJewels. Thus, [the Jewel Affinity] says:17This affinity for the Three JewelsIs the domain of the omniscient ones.Only a buddha fully comprehends the unobscured authentic condition ofthe affinity; others do not.

There are several ways in which this explanation isgiven. However, the essence of enlightenment as spoken of in the way ofthe perfections can be considered to be the causal continuum in the sys-tem of the great yoga tantra, in which case the uncommon and specialfeature is what is known as self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes itsown nature], the nature of great bliss. An extensive discussion of this nowfollows.[Tilopa’s] Perfect Words states:19Evam, the nature of method and wisdom,Abides in the center of the bodyAs total pristine awareness present in the body.The method [aspect] referred to in this verse is emphasized in the fathertantra, while the wisdom [aspect] is emphasized in the mother tantra. Eachhas its own way of elucidating the union [of method and wisdom], thenature of evam.

As to the way it is described, [Buddhashrijnana’s]Liberative Essence states:20Totally free from any kind of concept,Utterly inconceivable and inexpressible,Like space, the stainless source of everything:It is known as profundity beyond scrutiny.Bearing the form of the total seal,It is like a magical illusion or a rainbow,Purifying one’s own and others’ minds:It is known as sublime clarity.The supreme nature of their indivisibilityIs the essence that pervades all things,Utterly untouched by cyclic existence:It is known as the ultimate dimension of phenomena.21According to the mother tantra, the natural glow of primordially purepristine awareness is present as “semen” [white vital essence] and “ovum”[red vital essence]. The element of “semen” generates the body, while theelement of “ovum” generates speech, which is of the nature of wind. [Bodyand speech] are each referred to as a “body.” That which depends on, orabides in, these two bodies is known as the “pristine awareness dimensionof great bliss nature.” In this system, this represents the essence of enlight-enment. The Hevajra Tantra states:22Great pristine awareness is present in the body.Totally devoid of all conceptuality,It is that which pervades all things.Although abiding in the body, it did not arise from it.23The Kalachakra [Condensed] Tantra says:24That being the case, the Foremost One [Kalachakra] explainedthe body’s innate bliss25 of non-emission in the way of [secret]mantra.The mind in its aspect of not recognizing the very essence of such bliss istermed “darkness.” Accordingly, “buoyancy” [white vital essence], “motil-"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u0002163ity” [red vital essence], and “darkness” [ignorance] denote body, speech,and mind26 in the impure phase, and the three indestructible states of awak-ened body, speech, and mind in the pure phase. As is said in the Kalachakra[Root Tantra]: 27[Va m] is declared to be a sphere, moon, “semen,” and awakenedbody;[E is] the aspiration sign, “ovum,” sun, and awakened speech;The syllable a is Rahu, awakened mind.The element of space exists as e.The effect of not realizing that great bliss is the unfolding of cyclic exist-ence. The effect of realization of great bliss is becoming a buddha. Thus,bliss is also called the natural condition of, nature of, or affinity for, bothcyclic existence and perfect peace.When bliss has not been realized, all phenomena of the state of cyclicexistence—the outer environment, the bodies, voices, and minds of theinhabitants [sentient beings], and so on—arise from the qualities of “motil-ity,” “darkness,” and “buoyancy.” When bliss has been realized, all the di-mensions of buddhas and their realms manifest from the nature of thatgreat bliss.The darkness aspect of bliss is designated as the “luminous clarity of thetotal empty” and the “indestructible vital essence which is the root of cyclicexistence.” This constitutes the final [impediment] to be overcome by in-nate pristine awareness. [Aryadeva’s] [Lamp] Summary of Tantric Practicesstates:28All beings are without freedomAs they are not born out of free will.The cause of their condition is luminous clarity:The luminous clarity of the total empty.The luminous clarity referred to in this verse exists within the same collec-tion as “semen” [white vital essence], “ovum” [red vital essence], and wind;this collection is also present in the formless realm comprising very subtleelements.29 It encompasses all the states of mind within cyclic existence.Therefore, in Kalachakra, such a collection is taught using expressions suchas the “ground-of-all consciousness,” “habitual tendency for emission,” “mindof the fourth state” and “obscuration of dispersion.”30"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"164\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA[Next is] a supplementary presentation of the various synonyms for theground continuum:Sutras and tantras expound the ground continuum using manysynonyms:Essence of enlightenment, transcendent wisdom,emptiness,Original lord, innate pristine awareness, and other terms.In the causal way, such terms as “essence of enlightenment,” “transcendentwisdom,” and “emptiness,” plus the other hundred names for transcendentwisdom, are used to teach this ground continuum. A very extensive rangeof terms is found in the mantra system, including “original lord” and “in-nate pristine awareness” as well as the many synonyms for ultimate truth in[Aryadeva’s] [Lamp] Summary of Tantric Practice,31 “luminous clarity,” “in-destructible pristine awareness,” and so on. Many expressions such as“suchness” and “perfect end” are found in [Buddhashrijnana’s] Oral Teach-ings of Manjushri.32 In other sources, the ground continuum is taught usingmany synonyms such as evam, aham, and nada.33THE IMPURE STATE: THE MANIFESTATION OF APPEARANCES BASEDON THE CONDITION OF DECEPTION [(2)]Coemergent ignorance creates the deception of the eightfoldgroup, from which arisesThe dualism of apprehended and apprehender and the variousmanifestations of cyclic existence and perfect peace.The essence of enlightenment, or ground-of-all,34 does not fall to the side ofeither cyclic existence or perfect peace, nor can it be partitioned. Nonethe-less, it serves as the ground for the unimpeded manifestation of all appear-ances of cyclic existence and perfect peace; hence, it is a support. Supportedby it are the ground-of-all consciousness (which is simply [a collection of ]habitual tendencies), the instigative [subjective] mind, the sixth or mentalconsciousness, and the five sense consciousnesses.35 This eightfold group[of consciousnesses] and attendant mental factors are adventitious stainsthat can be shed. Therefore, it is this latter appropriating consciousness,36or ground-of-all at the level of the habitual tendencies based on ignorance,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u0002165which was declared [by the Buddha] to be the root of cyclic existence. Ref-erence to this is found in discourses and commentaries that pertain to thelast cycle of [Buddha’s] teachings.37That being the case, coemergent with [mind’s] true nature, just as it is—the primordial, or root, indestructible great vital essence38—is ignorance ofit. Owing to this ignorance, wind that is as though mixed with that very[vital essence] activates the subjective mind. When this movement is notrecognized for what it is, due to the influence of the red aspect [vital es-sence] of manifestation, there arise the appearances of cyclic existence andperfect peace: this is the conception of other. Due to the influence of thewhite aspect [vital essence], there arises the sense of self,39 and thus theeightfold group of consciousnesses unfolds.40In brief, stirred by the movement of wind, the red and white [vital es-sences] initiate the dualistic split into apprehended and apprehender, orappearances and mind, self and other, subject and object, and so on. Allconceptions of self are the unborn essence that is [mind’s] true nature, oremptiness aspect; all conceptions of other arise as the unimpeded nature, orappearance aspect: This represents the manifestation of the various decep-tive appearances of both cyclic existence and perfect peace.In that [process], of what is there ignorance? Of one’s true nature, just asit is, the intrinsically pure essence.Due to what is there ignorance? Due to the unimpeded creative energythrough which the essence of that true nature falsely manifests as subject-object duality.In what way does ignorance unfold? The cause for ignorance and decep-tion regarding immutable great bliss is the habitual tendency for mutable[bliss].41 From this tendency, the twelve links of dependent origination againarise. As stated in Pundarika’s Great Commentary on the Kalachakra Tantra,cyclic existence arises from habitual tendency; and habitual tendency, fromcyclic existence, in a circular way.The four empties and four elemental properties together formthe root of cyclic life.Still within the uncommon system of mantra, next is explained the mannerof deception in cyclic existence according to the father tantra system.The four empties (the luminous clarity of the total empty, [great empty,very empty, and empty]) give rise to the four elemental properties [wind,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"166\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAfire, water, and earth].42 The group of these together is considered to be theroot that determines beings’ migration [in cyclic existence]. Accordingly,Aryadeva [in his Stages of Self-Blessing] states:43One should understand that the eight constituents—The four elements, earth, and so on,And, likewise, the four empties–-Are the causes of creation and destruction.To explain, first, from the luminous clarity ground-of-all [at death], thetotal empty, emerges only the afflicted mind of ignorance, which is thegreat empty, or “full culmination.” From that emerges the variety of mentalevents, the very empty, or “increase of light.” From that arises “light” as [theduality of ] apprehended and apprehender, manifesting as the six [sense]consciousnesses in their coarse aspects; this is the empty.44 From that arisethe four elements and other constituents. The way this process occurs isdescribed in the Compendium on the [Indestructible] Pristine Awareness[Tantra]: 45The consciousness that arises from luminous clarity is called mind,[afflicted] mind, and [sense] consciousnesses.46 That is the root ofall phenomena. It is possessed of a nature that is both thoroughlyafflicted and utterly pure. From that consciousness, two concep-tions develop, that of self and that of other. From that conscious-ness, wind arises; from wind, fire; from fire, water; and from water,earth. From these elements arise the five aggregates, the six sensefields, and the five objects, all of which are mixed with conscious-ness.In this way is explained the unfolding of the wheel of cyclic existence asconsciousness arises from ignorance of luminous clarity, and so on.An alternative explanation is that cyclic life arises frommundane innate bliss; the indestructible vital essenceIs the root of the thirty-six psychophysical constituents.According to the mother tantra system, cyclic existence arises from mun-dane innate bliss.47 [Pundarika’s] Great Commentary [on the KalachakraTantra] states:"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF MIND\u0002167The creator is that which possesses the characteristic of the ground-of-all consciousness: the relative and mundane innate joy [at] themoment of the emission of semen.“That which possesses the characteristic of the ground-of-all consciousness”serves as the cause of ignorance. When “semen” [white vital essence] and“ovum” [red vital essence] meet, the mind experiences bliss. Through thisexperience, the ground-of-all is “blessed”48 and becomes of one flavor withthe bliss, as though unconscious. Such bliss is the agent of a being’s emer-gence into life (conception) and withdrawal from life (death).To explain, at death, the white [vital essence], red [vital essence], andmind mix at the heart, and at conception they mix in the womb. Sincenothing but the pristine awareness of a buddha can split [such a union], itis called the “indestructible vital essence.” This is what is referred to as the“evam” of the causal continuum, the nature or the root of the thirty-six[psychophysical constituents], the aggregates, elements, and so on.49Holders of esoteric instructions point out that mental states of the sametype are also called the ground-of-all, examples being the fourth state andthe dazed state of mind when one is physically exhausted."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"168\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002169 9.

The way of the perfections teaches that the ground-of-allconsciousness is drawn by the afflicted mind and the force of karma createdby adhering to a self, and takes birth in the three worlds. These two viewsare basically identical.Within the tantra sets are found several different estimations [of thenumber of elements in the process of deception], such as a threefold mode[of enumeration] based on the differentiation of “semen” [white vital es-sence] and “ovum” [red vital essence] into apprehended and apprehender,plus wind; a fourfold mode, when pristine awareness is considered separatefrom ovum; and so on. Despite these distinctions, the crucial point [whichwill now be presented] is the same. When the great root indestructible [essence] is not recognized, there ismovement [of ignorance]. Owing to the influence of the white vital essence(the apprehending quality), there arise the three lights which have as theirroot a conception of intrinsic reality. The “doors” of manifestation of thethree lights arise as follows:The definitive quality of wind (whose nature is the unborn essence)manifesting as objects gives rise to the appearances of the formlessrealm.The definitive quality of ovum [red vital essence] (whose nature is theunimpeded nature) manifesting as objects gives rise to the appearances ofthe form realm.The definitive quality of semen [white vital essence] (whose nature is themanifold expression) manifesting as objects gives rise to the appearances ofthe desire realm.By grasping to these appearances as existent in themselves, the [processof ] taking birth in the three realms is gradually initiated. What is experi-enced [i.e., which of the three realms] is determined by how subtle or coarseis the dispersion of the elemental properties [of earth, water, fire, wind, andspace]; and which of the four modes of birth occurs depends on which ofearth, water, fire, or wind is predominant.1"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002171Among these possibilities, the best [form of life, or] “support,” for beinga suitable recipient of the indestructible way of secret mantra is birth in[one of ] the three continents, the eastern, southern, or western. Any ofthose births has all the characteristics of the manifest dimension of awaken-ing [although still] attended by stains. Of those, the most exceptional isbirth here in [the southern continent called] the Land of Jambu, place ofactions. Such a birth is best because one is thereby endowed with the sixelements [space, wind, fire, water, earth, and pristine awareness], and re-plete with all features of the vajra body which is the ground where purifica-tion [through tantric practice] is effected.2Accordingly, the aggregates, elements, and sense fields are all formedfrom the channels, winds, and vital essences; and these three, from mindnature, the essence of enlightenment, attended by stains. For this reason,birth in the world in itself is taught to be the supreme manifest dimen-sion of awakening, attended by stains. Accordingly, the Hevajra Tantrastates:3The womb’s wall is one’s monastic robe;One’s mother, the preceptor;Palms together touching the head, an act of homage;And life’s activities, the observance of ethics.The recitation of mantra, a and ham;The form of the mandala at the womb, a;And the aspect of great bliss, ham;With a naked body and hairless head and face,One is a monk who is born while reciting mantras.Owing to these conditions, all sentient beingsAre buddhas, there is no doubt.Moreover, the ten months are the stages of awakening;Beings are already lords of the ten stages.4The meaning of this passage is that of the three dimensions at the groundphase when the mind is attended by stains, birth is appearance as the mani-fest dimension. This impure dimension itself is the ground which becomesthe supreme manifest dimension when stains are purified.Of the six elements, [some] beings are possessed of only one element,that of space, as in the four [levels of the] formless realm; [others] have upto five elements (space, wind, fire, water, and earth), as in the first level ofmeditative absorption [of the form realm].5 Beings of the six classes within"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"172\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe desire realm6 have not only all five elements but also the element ofpristine awareness, which is the release of regenerative fluid,7 and are therebypossessed of six elements.The term “body” denotes a collection, which in this case comprises thefollowing: marrow, bone, and sinew (or hair) produced by semen; and skin,flesh, and blood produced by ovum,8 together referred to as the “six treasur-ies.” The vajra body is the collection of these six, plus the thirty-six psycho-physical constituents.The thirty-six psychophysical constituents are the six aggregates (forms,feelings, discriminations, compositional factors, consciousnesses, and pris-tine awarenesses); the six elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space, and con-sciousness); the six sense powers (eye sense power, ear sense power, nosesense power, tongue sense power, body sense power, and mental sense power);their six objects (visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangible objects, and[mental] phenomena); the six action faculties (mouth faculty, arms faculty,legs faculty, anus faculty, urinary faculty, and regenerative faculty); and theirsix activities (speaking, taking, going, discharging faeces, discharging urine,and emitting regenerative fluid).CHANNELS [(b)]There are the three channels, twenty-four major channels, sixchannel-wheels,And seventy-two thousand subtle channels, within which[winds flow].According to the highest yoga tantras, the arising of pristine awareness inthe mind depends upon the functioning of the channels of the body.9 It istherefore important to understand their authentic condition.

Similarly, the root of all pristine awareness chan-nels is the central channel; the root of all cyclic existence channels, the lifechannel. Hence, the inseparability of those two, the channel of Rahu, isreferred to as the “life channel” from the perpective of its being the supportfor life.Concisely stated, the “central channel of the ground” denotes the centralchannel of the body in the impure state pervaded by the dimension, oraffinity, of the central channel in the pure state at the time of the result.Through the meditations of withdrawal and the other branches [of thesixfold yoga], wind and mind enter the central channel of the body to somedegree, the result of which is the manifestation externally of an empty im-age in the form of a black line. This is referred to as the “central channel ofthe path.”12The “central channel of the result” abides in the supreme vajra body,which is the alternative [purified] dimension [the mandala]. It is of a naturefree from obscurations. This [threefold] differentiation is made by the EighthKarmapa [Mikyö Dorjé].Owing to [the duality of ] apprehended and apprehender, the rasana [rightchannel] and the lalana [left channel] branch off from the central channel.Above the navel, the three channels [right, left, and central] serve, respec-tively, as pathways for the threefold life [wind], the solar, lunar, and Rahu,and below the navel, as pathways for the movement of the threefold down-ward voiding of feces, urine, and regenerative fluids.13There are twenty-four major channels which branch off from those three[principal] channels. Within the body, the twenty-four are the channelsthemselves; in the outer world, [these correspond to] the twenty-four [power]places; and in the alternative dimension of the mandala, these are the na-tures of the twenty-four yoginis of awakened mind, speech, and body.14Adding to those twenty-four the five channels of the heart, which aresupports for the [five] branch winds,15 plus the three principal channels,yields thirty-two channels. [Thirty] are explained as being the fifteen god-desses of Nairatmya [in the mandala of Hevajra], the utter purity of thefifteen parts of the waxing moon and fifteen parts of the waning moon.16The [remaining two] are the conch-shell channel, which serves as the sup-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"174\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAport for the sixteen white parts, and the free-from-demons channel, thesupport for the sixteen black parts.17Adding the five channels that are the supports for the five root winds18 tothe above thirty-two makes a total of thirty-seven channels. At the ground[phase], these thirty-seven channels are associated with the thirty-six con-stituents [of the vajra body], plus the vajra mind [of pristine awareness]which pervades these constituents. At the path phase, they are associatedwith the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening.19Moreover, there are what are known as the five hidden channels: thetriple-circle channel, which reaches the center of the eyes; the desire chan-nel, which reaches the center of the ears; the female-householder channel,which reaches the center of nose; the fierce channel, which reaches the cen-ter of the tongue; and free-from-demons channel, which reaches the centerof the uvula.20 These five hidden channels are connected to the central onesince their roots meet in the channel in the center of the heart. They emergefrom indestructible luminous clarity at the heart [region] of the centralchannel and enter into objective experience, the perception of forms, andso on. During the phase of the path, these channels are bound and conse-quently become the source through which ten signs manifest.21 Thus, theyare “hidden” in being like hidden treasures or seeds.Supported by the central channel are four (or six) channel-wheels(chakra). The term “wheel” is used because the configuration of channel[-spokes] (“petals”) resembles a wheel, or, alternatively, because [like a wheelwhich shatters what lies in its path,] by binding crucial points and strikingcrucial points at these places,22 the deceptions of the four states are shattered.In the system of four channel-wheels, at the navel are sixty-four channel-spokes which are the purity23 of the sixty-four winds of the [twelve] timeconjunctions.24 By binding crucial points [through the method of innerheat], one causes the waking state to arise as the realization of the manifestdimension of awakening.At the heart are the eight channel-spokes which are the purity [of thewinds] of the eight major sessions25 of the day and night. By binding crucialpoints [through the method of luminous clarity], one causes the deep sleepstate to arise as the realization of the reality dimension of awakening, lumi-nous clarity.At the throat are sixteen channel-spokes which are the purity [of thewinds] of the sixteen transits.26 By binding crucial points [through themethod of dream yoga], one causes the dream state to arise as the realiza-tion of the enjoyment dimension of awakening."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002175At the head are thirty-two channel-spokes which are the purity [of thewinds] of the [thirty-two] major clepsydra measures.27 By binding crucialpoints [related to] vital essence, one causes the sexual union state to arise asthe realization of the pristine awareness dimension of awakening.28The Kalachakra Tantra states that there are six channel-wheels: the chan-nel-wheel at the crown of the head [with four spokes], which is of the na-ture of the four major sessions; the channel-wheel at the head [with sixteenspokes], the nature of the sixteen lunar days; the channel-wheel at the throat[with thirty-two spokes], the nature of the twenty-eight constellations andthe four stars [of the constellation Lyra]; the channel-wheel at the heart[with eight channels], the nature of the eight planets;29 the channel-wheelat the navel [with sixty-four channels], the nature of the sixty-four dandameasures;30 the channel-wheel at the secret place [with thirty-two chan-nels], the nature of the thirty-two white and black lunar days.The system of esoteric instructions speaks of secondary channel-wheelswhich branch off from those major ones: the twelve in the twelve majorjoints [of the limbs]; and the sixty in the sixty minor joints.31 From those[branch off ] 72,000 subtle channels,32 as stated in the Indestructible Garland.Concerning these, Rangjung Dorjé [in his Profound Inner Reality] says:33The twenty-four thousand through which flowThe lunar [wind and white vital essence] are called the lalana type.The twenty-four thousand through which flowThe solar [wind and red vital essence] are called the rasana type.The twenty-four thousand through which movesWind [only] are called the central channel type.Moreover, by being present in the bodyThe channels that are the twenty-four,From Undivided to Noble-Hearted,34Are divided into dissolved, engaged, and dominant.That threefold split yields a total of seventy-two,Each with a circle of a thousand channels.35One hundred and fifty-six channels are said to give rise to diseases.36 Fur-ther, the Teaching to Nanda states:37There are eighty thousand channels in all [of the body].Although there are many such enumerations [of channels], only those men-tioned above need be known by practitioners on the path."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"176\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAs to the sequence of formation of the channels in the womb, the centralchannel is the first to form, providing a support for the life wind. There, therasana and lalana manifest due to the force of the conception of self [gener-ated] by the afflicted mind, and the conception of other [generated] by thesixfold group [of consciousnesses]. These three principal channels are merelydivisions into distinct entities owing to their mode of appearance and actu-ally come into existence simultaneously.From the points where the three meet with a common interior, the threechannels branch off as spokes of the channel-wheels. Thus, the formationof the three principal channels is followed by the sequential formation ofthe one hundred and twenty spokes of the four channel-wheels (or the onehundred and fifty-six spokes of the six channel-wheels). Next form the sev-enty-two thousand secondary channels, followed by the thirty-five millionsubtle channels connected to the pores of the skin.These channels exist as the nature of letters. What follows now is anexplanation of how the channels form as letters. [Chanting the Names ofManjushri] states:38A is the supreme of all letters.Initially [at conception], the [letter] a forms in the upright position at thenavel. Through the interrelationship of method [ham] and wisdom [a], hamforms upside-down at the head.39 As a result, evam comes into being as theexternal world in the nature of method and wisdom.40 Next develop thebhrum, am, dzim, kham, and hum at the heart, which are the supports forthe five emotional afflictions and the five nectars.41 Subsequently form thesixteen, ra, hya, sya, and so on, followed by the formation of the twenty-four [initial] letters of the twenty-four [power] places.42 After that, an in-conceivable number of letters develop, such as the one hundred and twentyletters [consonants].43 Within all of these [channels in the shape of letters]is the movement of winds, through which is produced speech that carriesthe sound of letters.WINDS [(c)]The life, root, and branch winds, and winds of the timeconjunctions,In the orders of generation and dissolution, always shift andmove [throughout the channels]."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002177The channels described above are created by winds. To strike the crucialpoints with respect to winds forms the basis of all aspects of the phase ofcompletion of the highest yoga tantra. The term “wind” (rlung) denotesthat which is possessed of potency or strength.The wind that serves as the ground for everything in cyclic existence andperfect peace is that which is great, primordial, and indestructible. To des-ignate it as a “wind” indicates that it is life; and since it exists as the natureof the short a,44 it is the source of all verbal expression, the speech. From itare derived [such measures as] breath, minor clepsydra measure, danda mea-sure, time conjunction,45 and so on. Furthermore, from this originate allletters, the vowels and consonants. Thus, although itself inexpressible, itserves as the ground for all forms of verbal expression.With regard to letters, the root of all vowels and consonants is a. Withregard to winds, the root of all the ten winds is the life wind in the form ofa. With regard to pristine awareness, supreme immutable great bliss itself istermed “a”. Therefore, the wind that serves as the ground or source of allphenomena is this very a, referred to as “life.” Hence, all phenomena ofcyclic life and perfect peace manifest from it.Accordingly, during the formation of this vajra body, the great life windis the first to come into being. This wind is supported by the ground-of-allconsciousness, which has entered the midst of the white and red [regenera-tive fluids].46 Of the five syllables, its shape is the form of the short a. Of thefive elements, its nature is that of the element of space.From the life wind emanates the downward-voiding wind. Of the fiveelements, its nature is that of earth; of the five syllables, its form is that ofthe syllable li. In a similar way is generated the upward-moving wind, whosenature is fire, and form, the syllable ri; the fire-accompanying wind, whosenature is wind, and form, the syllable i; and the pervading wind, whosenature is water, and form, the syllable u. These are the five root winds.47The five branch winds are the serpent wind of the earth element, thelong syllable a; the turtle wind of the wind element, the syllable e; the lizardwind of the fire element, the syllable ar; the gift-of-the-gods wind of thewater element, the syllable o; and the victorious-in-wealth wind of the earthelement, the syllable al. These branch winds, together with the root winds,constitute the ten winds.48To expand, that which is indestructible, the totality of everything, isdesignated as wind from the perspective of the aspect of movement. Windsexist as a blend of karma and pristine awareness.49 Wind dominated by [thequality of ] “darkness” is said to be the wind of Rahu; wind dominated by"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"178\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA“motility,” solar wind; and wind dominated by “buoyancy,” lunar wind.50These are therefore known as the “three winds,” Rahu, solar, and lunar. Thefive root winds, [called “root”] since they are of the natures of the five ele-ments, and the five branch winds, winds produced through the five el-emental transformations [the five sense objects],51 together make a total often coarse winds. When these ten are formed, the winds of the time con-junctions, which have the characteristics of inhalation and exhalation, movein and out 21,600 times daily.From conception of the vajra body in the womb until the tenth month,the ten winds arise and develop. After [birth], their powers gradually dis-solve over a period of [up to] one hundred years. During the development[of the body] in the womb, the first of the winds to form is the life wind, inthe form of a. Then, from the second month [until the tenth], the otherwinds, beginning with the downward-voiding wind, arise sequentially untilall ten are present.52During the course of life, the life [wind] abides within the central chan-nel as the dominant factor in determining the [cycles of ] increase anddecrease of winds.53 The winds that emanate from the life wind flow atthe heart [channel-wheel] as the nature of the eight periods. Each has theessential nature of five, or six, elements; when exhaled, they flow in theorder of dissolution [of the elements], and when inhaled, in the order ofgeneration.54Likewise, at the head, [the winds flow as the nature of ] the sixteen phasesof the moon, divided in terms of the white and red aspects into thirty-two.55At the throat, with the sixteen channels divided into method and wis-dom, [the winds flow as the nature of ] the thirty-two periods in [the modeof ] the course of the constellations, or as the sixteen transits.56At the navel, [they flow as the nature of ] the sixty danda measures (withthe twelve houses of the zodiac each divided into five sectors), along withthe four winds [of the element] of emptiness which flow in the centralchannel, moving in phases of generation and dissolution.57[Winds flow] through the seventy-two thousand subtle channels. Themovement of wind alone [takes place] in the central channel type; move-ment of wind together with the white aspect, in the lalana type; and move-ment of wind together with the red aspect, in the rasana type. The windscomprising 21,600 [breaths] complete their movements in all of the three[types of ] channels in the period of one day. Moreover, in each exhalationand inhalation, [the winds] shift and move to the extremities of the pores[of the skin]."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002179In short, the way the wind flows internally parallels the wind’s move-ment externally, and can therefore be understood from astrology. Exter-nally, there are twelve months in one year, while internally there are twelvetransits. Externally, each house of the zodiac has five danda measures, whileinternally each [breath’s cycle] has five mandalas [elements].58 Externally,one year is composed of 21,600 major clepsydra measures, while internally,there are [21,600] daily breaths.The main activity of the external movement of the winds is that of thewinds passing from the mandalas [elements] of the navel into the rasanaand lalana channels and then being exhaled through the nostrils.59 Thewind that passes through the right nostril is the solar wind. Because it flowsthrough stages when the potency [of the elements] is being exhausted, it iscalled “poison wind.” Its nature is that of method; its essence is indestruc-tible awakened speech. The solar wind flows through the right nostril at arate of 10,462.5 times per day. The wind that passes through the left nostrilis the lunar wind. Because it flows through stages when the elements areincreasing, it is called “nectar wind.” Its nature is that of wisdom; its es-sence, indestructible awakened body. The lunar wind flows through the leftnostril at a rate of 10,462.5 times per day.60Wind flows equally through the center [of both nostrils] at a rate of675 [times] per day. It is possessed of power resembling that of the exter-nal [planet] Rahu and is therefore called “element of Rahu.”61 It createsopenness like space and is therefore called “wind of space.” Since it entersthe central channel, it is also called “wind of pristine awareness.” Its na-ture is indivisible method and wisdom; its essence, indestructible awak-ened mind.62Three hundred and sixty movements of each one of the winds of theelements (earth, water, fire, wind, and space) through both the left andright nostrils constitute what is termed a “minor transit.” All of these move-ments [of all five winds] together, a total of eighteen hundred, is termed a“major transit.” Every day, twelve of the major transits occur, a total of21,600 movements. Within these, there are 675 [movements] of the windof pristine awareness. In each of the twelve major transits of the day, thepristine awareness wind flows fifty-six and one quarter times; and in each ofthe minor cycles, eleven and one quarter times, or, in short, one thirty-second of each breath.Moreover, half of the pristine awareness wind flows externally, and halfflows internally. In the external world, the increase and decrease caused bythe winds of the phases63 of the planets’ [movement throughout the con-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAstellations] is posited as the course of time. Similarly, this pristine awarenesswind [is the basis for the internal increase and decrease and thereby] deter-mines the phases of the [movement of ] planets [i.e., winds] internally. Thus,it is called the “inner wheel of time [kalachakra].”64When the external movement [of pristine awareness wind] increases,there occur signs of eventual death; when [this wind] is retained internally,immortality is attained.65In [a lifetime of ] one hundred years, the total time taken by the move-ments of pristine awareness wind equals three years and three fortnights. Ifduring that period, one were to transform all karmic wind into pristineawareness wind, one would attain enlightenment. That is the meaning ofthe Buddha’s statement [in the Kalachakra tantra] that “the state of vajra-holder is attained in three years and three fortnights.”66One should study works such as Rangjung Dorjé’s Profound Inner Real-ity to learn about the colors of the winds, their qualities, strengths, func-tions, entrances, wind retention methods, the advantages of retention, anddisadvantages of non-retention.67Concisely stated, everything of cyclic existence and perfect peace wasdeclared by the Buddha to be of the nature of wind. All winds fall into thecategories of the wind of karma and the wind of pristine awareness. Karmicwind is wind that is inseparable from thought. There are two karmic winds,karmic wind to be relinquished and remedial karmic wind.Karmic wind to be relinquished [is threefold]. The conception of self,which has been present in the ground-of-all, is the wind of delusion. Notknowing the five lights (which are the appearance aspect of pristine aware-ness) to be self-manifestation, conceiving [the lights] to be “other,” andthe craving that develops is the wind of desire. Based on that previouswind, the discrimination of phenomena in terms of what to accept andwhat to reject and the fixation that develops is the wind of aversion. Thenature of those three poisons is ignorance, the power of which createscyclic existence.68The second karmic wind is remedial wind which stops the course ofcyclic existence; this is correct thought, such as the view of the absence ofself. Nevertheless, it is still designated as karmic wind.In short, that which is called “karmic wind” is [equivalent to] thoughtin that it stirs [things], [is involved with] the subtle, and moves from one[thing] to the next.69 The great wind of pristine awareness is mind nature,that of bliss, clarity, and non-thought. When pristine awareness wind isdirectly cognized, all the movements of karmic wind are overcome."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002181VITAL ESSENCES [(d)]“Spring” and “vital essence,” the twelve refined and twenty-four residual vital essences,In the types of the dissolved, engaged, and dominant, flow[throughout the channels].The term “vital essence” (thig le) ([Sanskrit] tilaka) denotes the essence orseed of great bliss.The “ineffable root vital essence” refers to one’s own mind, an invinciblepresence from time without beginning, the essential nature of the threedimensions of awakening. The “vital essence of deceptive ignorance” refersto the arising of the deception of dualistic apprehension as a result of thedisturbance caused by the three “minds” (the white aspect [giving rise to theconception of apprehender]; the red aspect [the conception of the appre-hended]; and wind [ignorance, the basis of the two]). The “imputed vitalessence of mantra” refers to the four names [i.e., the aggregates of feelings,discriminations, compositional factors, and consciousnesses], as well as thenominal [remedies in the practice of mantra]. The “dependent vital essence ofwind” refers to the wind and the binding of it as a remedy. The “vital essenceof substance” refers to the white and red vital essences, along with the meth-ods for binding them. This categorization [of five different types of vitalessence] is set forth by Rangjung Dorjé [in his Profound Inner Reality].70An alternative way of presenting vital essences speaks of two: one, thevital essence imputed as the relative, and two, the ultimate vital essence ofpristine awareness. What follows now is a discussion on the vital essenceimputed as the relative, or vital essence of substance.71Thirty-six refined and residual vital essences abide within the channels.These exist like riches owned by the winds and are supported by them. Therefined essence of the white aspect of the vital essence of substance is lo-cated at the upper end of the central channel in the nature of the syllableham.72 On this, the Equal to the Sky Tantra says:73The indestructible in the shape of hamIs a gem white as a jasmine flowerMoist with luster and radiance.The refined essence of the red aspect in the form of a short a74 is located atthe junction of the three [principal] channels below the navel. TheSamvarodaya Tantra states:75"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"182\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAIts very essence resembles the fire of the Mare-Head.76The names of these [two refined essences, white and red] are, respectively,“spring” and “vital essence.” Krishna says [in his Vital Essence of Spring(Vasantatilaka)]:77The invincible ham, the seed,Is that which drips like frost.It gladdens all creatures’ hearts.And thus is known as “spring.”The fire, by virtue of its great form,Is called Varahi, the “vital essence.”Fanned by the winds of karma,It blazes at the mandala of the navel.As it reaches spring, it gives pleasure.Resting in union [with Varahi]Is the hero, the glorious Heruka,Called “vital essence of spring.”78In the midst of the white and red aspects is the ground-of-all, accompaniedby the great life wind supported by it. Thus, when represented by an outerlocation, [the red and white], in essence, are the Indestructible Seat, orheart of awakening.79In short, because the white aspect yields bliss, it is said to be “spring”;and because the red aspect stabilizes bliss, it is said to be “vital essence.”80[The white and red aspects], being the place where awakening is actualized,are considered to be the Indestructible Seat.The refined vital essences support corresponding residual essences, whichalso have refined and residual parts.81 The refined part gives strength andradiance to the body; the residual part is emitted through the [regenerative]faculties and other orifices.82It is those refined and residual parts which become the element of “re-generative fluid” at the end of the sevenfold [process of ] refinement of therefined essences from the [inner] fire offering of food. [This process] istherefore known as the “seven births.”83The vital essences derived from the “seven births” [process] are very nu-merous. However, the principal among them are twelve refined and twenty-four residual, thirty-six in all."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE NATURE OF THE BODY\u0002183The twelve refined vital essences [are enumerated as follows]: Five vital es-sences are connected to the five branch winds.84 Five are connected to the fiveroot winds. Three vital essences are supported by the lunar, solar, and Rahuwinds [flowing in the channels] above [the navel], but because the life [wind]bears the attributes of the sun, the three are considered as one, the solar vitalessence. Three vital essences are supported by the channels below [the navel,which allow voiding of ] feces, urine, and semen, but because the down-ward-voiding [wind] bears the attributes of the moon, the three are consid-ered as one, the lunar vital essence. That makes twelve refined vital essences.The twenty-four residual vital essences are supported by twenty-four majorchannels of the body. These channels are differentiated in terms of the eightplaces of awakened body and sky-farers below the earth; the eight places ofawakened speech and sky-farers on the earth; and the eight places of awak-ened mind and sky-farers in space.85Depending on whether the vital essences [in the body] and the sky-farers[in the external world] are always or occasionally present, and due to vari-ous other considerations, there exist, externally and internally, the principaland related [power] places, the two each divided into four, constituting theeight places that are the sphere of awakened mind; the fields, related fields,meeting places, and related meeting places, the four each divided intotwo, constituting the eight places that are the sphere of awakened speech;and the assembling places, related assembling places, charnel grounds,and related charnel grounds, the four each divided into two, constitutingthe eight places that are the sphere of awakened body.

The engaged refers to the present aspect, therefined vital essence, principally the white aspect, which is currently per-forming its function. The dominant agent in the generation [of vital es-sence] refers to the future aspect, the cause or root of both the refined andthe residual, and therefore a mixture of wind and blood.87The twenty-four vital essences are also each divided into three thousand,a total of seventy-two thousand.

[Each stems] from notrecognizing the very natures of the channels, winds, and vital essences, andadhering to them in terms of apprehended and apprehender.When the sixfold group of consciousnesses becomes unclear and with-draws into the ground-of-all, there occurs the state of deep sleep.The emergence of a mental consciousness attended by compositionalfactors is the state of dream.The emergence of active consciousnesses in the aspects of apprehendedand apprehender through which the sixfold group [of consciousnesses] en-ters into objective experience is the ordinary [waking] state.The experience of the habitual tendency for emission is the state of sexualunion.Connected to the particular period of those four states is a predominantconsciousness.

The first immutable great emptiness is the alternative [puri-fied] dimension of the following [psychophysical constituents]: the aggre-gate of pristine awarenesses and the aggregate of consciousnesses (of the sixaggregates); the element of pristine awareness and that of space (of the sixelements); the mental sense power and the ear sense power (of the six sensepowers); [mental] phenomena and sounds (of the six objects); the maleregenerative faculty and the female regenerative faculty (of the six actionfaculties); and the discharging of urine and the emission of regenerativefluid (of the six activities).4 [This emptiness] is the essential nature of the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"SYMBOLSYMBOLS FOR THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM\u0002189letter a, symbolized by an inexpressible figure in the shape of a curved knifein the central position,5 and is possessed of the essential nature of the pris-tine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena.The second immutable great emptiness is the alternative dimension ofthe aggregate of compositional factors, the element of wind, the sense powerof the nose, the object of odors, the action faculty of the mouth, and theactivity of speaking.

Although the five great emptinessesare indistinguishable in terms of substance, the appearance aspect of thoseis posited [as six immutable empty essences] from the perspective of theirunobscured aspect, that of the emptiness endowed with the supreme of allaspects.14To clarify the above, the first empty essence is the unobscured aspect,that of the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, of the fol-lowing [psychophysical constituents]: the aggregate of the consciousnesses(of the six aggregates); the element of space (of the six elements): the sensepower of the ears (of the six sense powers); the object of sounds (of the sixobjects); the female regenerative faculty (of the six faculties of action); andthe emission of regenerative fluid (of the six activities of the action facul-ties).

This [empty] essence is the essentialnature of the sa group, [symbolized by] the inexpress-ible figure positioned directly below the curved knifein the center.15The six inexpressible figures, which symbolize thesix immutable empty essences, drawn in sets of twowith one part outside and one inside, form three sides.By drawing the right and left tips of the former [upperset] and latter [lower set] touching to create a triangle,there is formed a support for the syllable vam, that is,the syllable e in the shape of a triangular source of phe-nomena.16 The assemblage of the [six] groups of con-sonants completes the body of the syllable e, owing tothe definitive qualities of body and mind. The Indestructible Garland says:17Evam, the seal of the transcendent ones,Is the symbol for nonduality;It denotes the inseparabilityOf emptiness and compassion.and the Samputa Tantra states:18E is said to be wisdom;Va m, the nature of method.As expressed in those lines, the two [syllables] e and vam represent the na-tures of wisdom and method and are primordially unified or connected. There-fore, each of the three (e, vam, and their union) alone is endowed with thefollowing three attributes: the unobscured nature of the thirty-six psycho-physical constituents; the same flavor as the thirty-six; and the unification ofthe thirty-six. However, with respect to which is the principal, the syllable e(the six immutable [empty essences]) is explained to be principal in terms ofunobscured nature; the syllable vam (the five immutable [emptinesses]), prin-cipal in terms of the same flavor; and the union of e and vam, principal inFigure 4: The vowele of the Vartulascript, composed ofthe figures of thenatures of thesix groups ofconsonants, symbolsof the six emptyessences."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"194\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAterms of unification. To each of e, vam, and theirunion, the expressions “indestructible,” “invin-cible,” “holder of the vajra,” and others are ap-plied; the terms “ultimate” or “great” areconsidered applicable [only] to their union.By virtue of the crucial point of thenonduality of method and wisdom, the assem-blage of the thirty consonants completes thebody of the vowel e, which serves as the sup-port; and the assemblage of the [five] vowels,the body of the consonant vam, which is sup-ported. The unification of [e as] the support and[vam as] the supported represents the samenessof flavor of the union of evam, the symbolic sign.THE SYMBOLIZED MEANING [(b)]What is symbolized: “semen” and“ovum,” moon and sun, theaspects of method and wisdom,Vajra and sattva, the source of all tantras.[Next is a discussion of ] what is represented by the symbolic sign [evam]: Inthe context of the causal continuum, evam symbolizes “semen” [white vitalessence] and “ovum” [red vital essence], or the moon and sun; at the pathphase, it symbolizes the attributes of method and wisdom; and at theresult phase, it symbolizes vajra and sattva,19 and being the union of those,evam therefore represents the source of all tantras (both the meaning to beexpressed and the words that express it). The Kalachakra Root Tantrastates:20In the midst of the space element of syllable eThe bliss of all buddhas, syllable vam,Is captured. Vajra and sattva,Through the yogas of awakened body, speech, and mind,Are proclaimed as the sphere, moon, “semen,” and awakened body;And the aspiration sign, “ovum,” sun, and awakened speech;The syllable a is proclaimed as Rahu, awakened mind,And the element of space exists as e.Figure 5: The characterevaô of the Vartula script,of the nature of the verysubtle body and mind."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"SYMBOLSYMBOLS FOR THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM\u0002195Through the yogas of awakened body, speech, and mind,Through awakened body, speech, mind, and passion,The essential natures of the three worlds existIn the mandalas of awakened body, speech, and mind.According to this passage, great bliss itself [symbolized by vam] is, ulti-mately, transcendent wisdom, emptiness [symbolized by e]. Transcendentwisdom itself is Ever-Perfect, supreme, immutable pristine awareness. There-fore, the syllable vam, the five immutable great emptinesses, and the syllablee, the six immutable empty essences, are primordially connected as a union.To expand, with respect to method and wisdom as the roots [of the fiveimmutable great emptinesses and of the six immutable empty essences], thesyllable vam pertains to method, the male [deity], “semen” [white vital es-sence], and moon; the syllable e, wisdom, the female [deity], “ovum” [redvital essence], and sun.With respect to the six elements [of the vajra body], all elements arise[together]. Therefore, normally, when one element is present, all the othersare present too. However, in terms of which is the principal, water, wind,and space are posited as method, the male deity’s body, speech, and mind;and earth, fire, and pristine awareness, as wisdom, the female deity’s body,speech, and mind.In the relative system of the world, such associations [of elements] asmethod and wisdom would be inimical ones.21 In the ultimate sense, how-ever, the associations arise as [complementary] method and wisdom: earthand wind as method and wisdom, respectively; water and fire as methodand wisdom; and space and pristine awareness as method and wisdom.These associations are made from the perspective common [to the highesttantras].In the context of the unified method and wisdom of body and mind asfound in this tantra [Kalachakra], in the case of water, wind, and spacebeing the body, then earth, fire, and pristine awareness will certainly be themind. In the case of earth, fire, and pristine awareness being the body,then water, wind, and space will certainly be the mind. Accordingly, therelative way of the world would also be included in unified method andwisdom.That being the case, as explained above, e and vam are essentially insepa-rable. They are, however, differentiated in the expressions applied to them,such as “vajra” and “sattva”; “vajra” and “vajra-holder”; and “method” and“wisdom,” indicating a distinction between them."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"196\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAs to this distinction, vam is designated as the five immutable greatemptinesses since in the pristine awareness of immutable bliss (method), allof the psychophysical constituents are of the same flavor and inseparable. Eis designated as the six great empty [essences] since in the emptiness of allaspects (wisdom), the psychophysical constituents are of an unobscured[nature]. The five and six reflect divisions in terms of the numbers of thegrounds of purification. Both [e and vam] are termed empty because theyare free of the obscurations of the [dualistic] phenomena of cyclic existence,such as the psychophysical constituents.The essence of vam is the [aspect of ] knowing, which serves as the appre-hending subject, immutable great bliss: the resultant great seal. The essenceof e is the knowable, which serves as the apprehended object, images emptyof all aspects: the causal great seal.22The two are referred to by various names:The syllable e is known as empty image, appearance, lotus,Sattva, source of phenomena, element of space,Abode of great bliss, lion throne, and bhaga;And syllable vam, as great bliss, innate, supreme, immutable,Vajra, vital essence, essential reality,Pristine awareness, and utterly pure mind.Moreover, the syllable e is the appearance aspect of the syllable vam. Thus,in actuality, the root of all phenomena is [the nature of vam,] the five im-mutable great emptinesses. In that lies the knowledge of all the commonabridged [highest yoga] tantras.23 Accordingly, the [Hevajra Tantra] TwoExaminations states:24The mind, the great single reality,Is symbolized in form by the five.25Further, the Essence of the Great Seal, a tantra of the same class [as Hevajra],considers the root of all phenomena to be the indestructible vital essence. Itstates that the indestructible vital essence, when differentiated according toits presence in the centers of the six channel-wheels, comprises six unions:the potential for manifestation,26 the vital essence, the nature, the merenature, the supreme, and the other supreme alternative; and further statesthat the potential for manifestation and vital essence are considered as onewhen these six are condensed into a fivefold mode.27"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"SYMBOLSYMBOLS FOR THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM\u0002197The father tantra Guhyasamaja explains that the root of all phenomenais the four empties,28 from which the coarse appearances of cyclic existenceand perfect peace are said to arise. The Indestructible Garland, an explana-tory tantra of Guhyasamaja, considers the root of all phenomena to be theindestructible [vital essence], which, it states, is differentiated according toits presence in the centers of the six channel-wheels into the following six[aspects]: life, vital essence, the indestructible, the invincible, the originalsupreme, and the second supreme. These statements [on the root of allphenomena] are identical in meaning. Similarly, according to this tantra[Kalachakra], [the root of all phenomena] is considered to be the union, orequalness of flavor, of e and vam, the causal continuum.All of the appearances of cyclic life and perfect peace manifest from thevery nature of the causal continuum. As this occurs, the cyclic existenceaspect of the unobscured appearance aspect of that nature manifests asthe impure environment and inhabitants; and the nature aspect, as thepure state of perfect peace. Even the resultant manifestation as the im-pure environment and inhabitants is one that accords with the appear-ances of the impure environment and inhabitants as grounded in the truenature of the causal continuum. In other words, it is a manifestationthat is due to the existence of that single true nature. That this is so islogically sound in terms of the dependent arising of the result followingits cause.THE POWERFUL TEN-LETTER [MANTRA] [(2)]The causal continuum manifests as the powerful ten-lettermantra and Kalachakra.There are two aspects to this subject: representation in the powerful [man-tra of ] ten letters;29 and representation in Kalachakra.REPRESENTATION IN THE POWERFUL TEN-LETTER [MANTRA] [(a)]This section has two parts: the symbol; and the meaning symbolized by it.THE SYMBOL [(i)]The true-nature aspect of the impure environment and its inhabitants, whichexists grounded in the causal continuum, is the pervading agent, the inde-"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAstructible awakened body, present as the nature of the powerful [mantra] often letters.

However, when distinguishedfrom the standpoint of conceptual categories, the unobscured aspect of thatluminous clarity nature exists as the essence of the ten letters or signs, or“ten visions.”33 This aspect serves as the ground for the arising of the im-pure environment and its inhabitants, which are manifestations of the pow-erful ten-letter [mantra].[THE TEN LETTERS AS CYCLIC EXISTENCE] [(bb)]This section has two aspects: the pervading agent; and its sphere of pervasion.THE PERVADING AGENT [(1')]The pervading agent comprises awakened body, moon, and alternative [pu-rified] dimension; pristine awareness, sun, and alternative dimension; thefive elements; and the three seeds [ma, kshah, ha] of the inanimate andanimate (collections of the five elements), and the subtle [formless realm],ten altogether."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"SYMBOLSYMBOLS FOR THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM\u0002199THE SPHERE OF PERVASION [(2')]This is explained from the perspectives of the ground, path, and result.GROUND [(a')]The sphere of pervasion from the perspective of the ground represents boththe outer [world] and the inner [body]. As to the first, the outer [world], a,which is the “life” [of the consonants], symbolizes outer space; the fourletters ya, ra, va, la, the mandalas of wind, fire, water, and earth,34 respec-tively; ma, Mount Meru, the essential nature of the five elements; kshah,the collection of the animate life contained within the desire and form realms;ha, [the animate life within] the four levels of the formless realm; and thecrescent moon, sphere, and tip symbolize the moon, sun, and Rahu, whichare the ornaments of the outer world system.

Regarding these three, [Pundarika’s] glorious Stainless Lightstates:The Blessed One spoke of three types of confidence in [the con-text of ] this way of mantra. First is the period of confidence in thetantras; next is confidence in the teacher; and after that, confi-dence in oneself. These three confidences become the perfect pathto complete and perfect enlightenment.Otherwise, without these three confidences, regardless of whichpath the master reveals to the student, it will not yield the result ofcomplete and perfect enlightenment. This is due to the studentbeing of blind faith, whereby superficial truth leads [only] to amundane result.To expand, confidence in tantra is to have gained certainty [in it] sincetantra was definitely taught by the Buddha and therefore is valid. Con-fidence in the teacher is to have gained certainty [in him or her] since[the teacher holds] an unbroken transmission from Vajradhara right upto himself or herself and has not sullied the tantric pledges. Confidence inoneself is to have gained certainty [in oneself ] since the strength of thepractice of what one has learned has given rise to various experiences.That being the case, a person who possesses the [first] two types of con-fidence initially must learn the meaning of tantra. He or she therefore stud-ies the tantras and their commentaries. Once a sound understanding hasbeen achieved, that student should next begin cultivation of the two phases[of practice] of the meaning of tantra, the precondition for which is toreceive, in an appropriate manner, an authentic initiation and to assumeproperly the pledges and vows. All the stages of the mantric path are therebyincluded in [two steps]: first, receiving an initiation to ripen oneself and as-suming pledges; then, the main element [of the practice], the cultivation ofthe two phases of the path that effects liberation.

As to what constitutes “ripened,” the Ornament ofthe Scriptures states:3Food is considered ripe when conditions make itReady to eat; a boil is ripe when it’s ready to burst.Likewise, one is said to be ripe when, in this life,One is ready to pacify and fully apply the two sides.4As an example, at a given time, the [necessary] conditions for barley oranother food to be consumed may not yet have ripened. However, onceconditions are complete, before long, the food is considered ripe for eating.As [another] example, once the conditions for a boil to burst are complete,soon pus will emerge, which is taken to be the ripened [state].Likewise, in the way of the perfections, the ripened [state] is considered tobe that same life in which one is ready to relinquish what is to be relinquished[on the path of ] seeing and to develop the remedy, the path of seeing. Simi-larly, in this context [of highest yoga tantra], to be ripened is to become some-one who is ready to relinquish what is to be relinquished (the twoobscurations) and to achieve the goal of the supreme power [awakening];or, alternatively, to become someone of good fortune with the capacity toexplain the profound meaning of the two phases and to cultivate them.THE MEANING OF THE TERM [(ii)]The term for initiation5 is derived from [the Sanskrit] abhishimcha, of whichshimcha means to cast (or sprinkle). Symbolized by the casting of water inorder to clean, [the student is] initiated by the casting [of water] onobscurations so that the mind is cleansed to a state of purity. Also, theword shikta, from abhishikta, means to pour into a mold. Thus, one isinitiated when the potency of pristine awareness is “poured” into the cleanvessel of a pure mind. The second part of the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Ex-aminations states:6Because it is performed by “casting” and “pouring”It should be referred to as “initiation.”[Buddhashrijnana’s] Oral Teachings of Manjushri states:7As a result of undergoing pouring and casting, and becoming pure,one becomes a great master."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"206\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA[Vitapada’s] Commentary [on the Oral Teachings of Manjushri] states:8“Pouring” is the pouring of pristine awareness [symbolized by] waterand so forth into the clean vessel [of one’s mind] purified by thecommon vows and other vows. By having that “cast” onto one’smind, one gains the seeds for the purification of habitual tenden-cies of the ground-of-all [consciousness] and so on. That being thecase, one “becomes pure,” by means of which one becomes a suit-able recipient. “Becomes a great master” means one has receivedthe vajra master initiation.Alternatively, abhishimcha means to confer authority. Through the four ini-tiations, the student is authorized to cultivate [the four paths], respectively, ofthe phase of generation, inner heat, the circle of the mandala [i.e., the practicewith a consort], and the great seal, which is the path of the fourth [initia-tion]; to teach action, conduct, and the other tantras; and to perform theactivities for gaining ordinary and other types of powers. This is compa-rable to authorizing a person to perform royal duties by means of a coro-nation ceremony. Accordingly, [Rahulashrimitra’s] Light on the State ofUnion states:9The conferral of initiation authorizes one to hear about and teachmantra and tantra; and to practice [the way of ] mantra.Another etymology is as given in the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations:10...because it washes away stains and bestows good fortune.Accordingly, the four initiations cleanse the stains of the [student’s] body,speech, mind, and the three together; and bestow the good fortune of culti-vation of the four paths, the generation phase and the others.Moreover, numerous etymologies of the term for initiation are found inthe sets of tantras,11 their essential meaning summarized by the omniscientButön:It is called “empowerment” because it washes away stains,Empowers one to engage in [tantric] activities,Establishes potencies, effects attainment of the result,Permits [mantric] conduct, and grants liberation."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE PATH\u0002207TYPES OF INITIATION [(iii)]Initiations are of three types: the first, the causal initiation, which ripens theunripened [student]; that of the intermediate phase, the initiation of thepath, which consists in the application of what has ripened in the initiation;and the final one, the resultant initiation, which consists in the attainmentof the supreme result ensuing from [tantric] practice.The first type, which comprises the procedures for the ripening initia-tion conferred by the master on the student, is the one that will be dis-cussed below. The second, the initiation of the path, refers to contemplationsdone subsequent to the causal initiation. While this does include [initia-tion] taken by oneself by means of one’s own contemplation, the principalaspect is that of cultivation of contemplation on the meaning of the initia-tion until the result is reached. The third, the resultant initiation, is theactualization of unsurpassable awakening; it consists in the attainment ofthe supreme initiation and the symbolic initiation exemplified by the ini-tiation of great light.CONSEQUENCES OF NOT CONFERRING INITIATION [(iv)]If one has not received initiation, despite possessing a faultless knowledgeof the tantras and applying however great an effort in the [tantric] path, it isimpossible for one to attain exceptional powers, and therefore the expendi-ture of one’s energies will have been futile. Not only will one not achieveexceptional powers (even though some minor power might have beenachieved), but also both oneself and one’s master will suffer extremelyheavy consequences, such as birth in hell. There are countless referencesto such consequences as in the following passage from the KalachakraRoot Tantra:To teach tantra and contemplate its profound realityWithout the conferral of initiation,Despite a sound knowledge of the subject,Will lead to hell, not to freedom.Furthermore, when an initiation is being given, it is essential that it beconferred according to authentic ritual as taught in tantra, and not be one’sown invention.

That being the case, it isneedless to speak of the heavy consequences incurred should the ritual usedfor the actual initiation be contrary to tantra and of one’s own invention.Hence, the authenticity of the procedure is of utmost importance, as notedin the Essence of Pristine Awareness:12The initiation complete in all its rituals,Inclusive of the branch essential principleAnd transmitted in a lineage from one to the next,Is received from the words of the supreme master.13In addition, the Kalachakra Root Tantra states:Carry out the rituals as taught in the tantras.In that way, the deities will be propitiated;They will grant powers to all mantric adeptsAnd secure for them the supreme and other goals.To engage in rituals other than those,Whether of another lineage, activity, occasion,Type of mantra, place, direction, or deity,Will bring the performers no result.and the Susiddhi states:14The wise do not invent their ownSecret mantric methods or secret mantras.MERITS OF CONFERRING INITIATION [(v)]To become qualified to study the tantras and their commentaries and tocultivate the two phases; to purify the three obscurations;15 and to at-tain the two [types of ] powers—all are dependent upon having receivedan authentic initiation. Thus, the benefits of initiation are inconceiv-able.

Ghantapa [in his Synopsis of the Initiation Procedure forChakrasamvara] states:20Vajradhara has taught that the initiationIs preceded by [the preparation of ] the mandala.Mandalas are said to be of eight types, down to [as few as] two types.Nagabodhi [in his Twenty Rituals of the Guhyasamaja Mandala] speaks of eight:21"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"210\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRATo fulfill all the aims of your studentsPrepare the eight types of mandalas:The mandala of jewels, one of grains,One made of flowers, one of colors,The painted one, one of colored powders,The mandala of mind, and that of reality.Some great [tantric] pioneers of India taught seven types of mandalas:painted on cloth, [made of ] colored powders, [created by] contemplation,the body mandala, the bhaga, relative awakening mind, and ultimate awak-ening mind.22The Abhidhana Tantra presents six types:23The mandala of letters is the first,The second is the mandala of the insignia,The mudra of the hands is the third,The arrangement of the image is the fourth,The display of flowers is the fifth,The sixth is the mandala of gathered [deities].Once the mandalas have been prepared,Always venerate and actualize them.24Alternatively, the following six types are spoken of: the mandala of pristineawareness, the emanated, [created by] contemplation, [drawn with] col-ored powders, painted on cloth, and that of the body.According to very profound esoteric instructions,With veneration, one creates the five mandalas.The five mandalas referred to here are the colored powders (the outer shape),the body, the bhaga, the awakening mind, and the wind and pristine aware-ness (the essence). The same text also explains mandalas as being of fourtypes: colored powders, painted cloth, mind-[created], and the body mandala.Another [system], that of the exceptional esoteric instructions, speaks oftwo categories [of mandalas]: four mandalas used for conferral, from whichone receives the particular initiation; and four mandalas that serve as basesof purification, upon which initiation is conferred.The first four are the mandala made of colored powders (the outer shape);the mandala of bodhichitta (the secret substance); the mandala of the bhaga"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE PATH\u0002211(the consort); and the mandala of ultimate bodhichitta. The second fourare the mandala of the channels of the student’s body; the mandala of let-ters, the bhaga;25 the mandala of nectar-[like] element [white vital essence];and the mandala of wind and pristine awareness (the essence).Moreover, the Kalachakra and other tantras expound four mandalas:26three mandalas used for supreme initiations and the mandala of coloredpowders used for worldly [initiations].27Ghantapa28 speaks of three types of mandalas: the mandala painted oncloth for [initiation of ] persons of low faculties; the colored powders mandalafor those of average faculties; and the body as mandala for persons of sharpfaculties.Three mandalas are mentioned in the Continuation of the GuhyasamajaTantra and the Continuation of the Samputa Tantra:29 the body mandala, thebhaga, and awakening mind. To these, some apply the expression “the threemandalas of the secret entities.”The master Buddhaguhya [in his Commentary on the Purification of AllEvil Destinies Tantra]30 discusses three types of mandalas: that of the naturalcondition, that of contemplation, and the [outer] reflected-image mandala[made of colored powders].31 Moreover, the Awakened Body, Speech, andMind Tantra [belonging to the] Rali [class of tantras] states:32The [mandala] levels—contemplation, flowers, and colored powders—Correspond to differences in the faculties of recipients.Referred to here are three mandalas: [created by] contemplation, [one formedof ] heaps of flowers, and one of colored powders. Chandrakirti presents asimilar classification in his Commentary on the Ornament of the Realizationof Guhyasamaja 33 and states that mandalas made of heaps [of flowers] areintended for persons of sharp faculties. Thus, the present-day practice ofusing heaps of flowers as the mandala has valid sources.The Samputa Tantra states that there are two [kinds of mandalas]: theartificial outer mandala and the real inner mandala.[Nagarjuna’s] Five Stages also speaks of two mandalas, that of coloredpowders [to empower a student] as a master of the phase of generation, andthe mandala of illusion, as a master of the phase of completion.Emanated and pristine awareness mandalas are the spheres ofexperience of realized persons."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRASome of sharp faculties may enter the body mandala and heapsof flowers mandala.Those [mandalas referred to in the root verses] may be explained conciselyas follows: In the past, on the occasion of promulgating tantra, the BuddhaVajradhara emanated the mandala of pristine awareness, and thereuponconferred initiation on bodhisattvas on the tenth stage of awakening andexpounded the tantra. Moreover, the manifest dimension of the Buddhaemanated the mandala of the supreme manifest dimension and therebyinitiated those who had reached stages of realization. These types of mandalasare the spheres of experience exclusively of exalted beings and are beyondthe comprehension of ordinary individuals. Therefore, this limited descrip-tion of them cannot encompass them.The mandalas that are appropriate for ripening the student’s mindare said to be four: colored powders, painted cloth, mind mandala, andbody mandala.34 Nonetheless, in the systems of most [Indian] masters(with the exception of that of the greatly accomplished Ghantapa), ini-tiation in the body mandala must not be conferred on someone who hasnot previously received initiation [into a major mandala of the highestyoga tantra]. In addition, in the case of initiation conferred in a mind-[created] mandala, the master must be one who is exceptionally qualified.As a result, these two mandalas are not commonly used. Moreover, themandala formed of heaps of flowers is said to be for persons of sharpfaculties. Thus, these three mandalas are to be entered by [only] a fewspecial individuals.The mandalas appropriate for initial entry are mandalas ofcolored powders, painted on cloth,And tridimensional, each of which comprises three mandalas:that of the pledge deity,The invoked pristine awareness deity, and the myriadmanifestations of the buddha,Which are the bases of the initiation. ...The mandalas that are appropriate for persons of all three levels of faculties(low, average, or sharp) to first enter or be led into are those of coloredpowders, painted cloth, or tridimensional ones.

Of those, the colored-powders mandalais widely known. In some classifications (as in [Nagabodhi’s] eightfold divi-sion given above and others), it is differentiated according to the substanceof the colored powders and the way the [deity’s] insignia are arranged. Themandala painted on cloth is elucidated in the Achala Tantra, which belongsto the highest yoga tantra system, as well as [in the works of ] numerousIndian masters.35 Although not explicit in the above classifications of mandalas, aripening initiation in a tridimensional mandala built as the celestialpalace is definitely valid. In fact, it is said that the Lord of the Lineage,Manjushri-yashas,36 conferred the ripening initiation in a tridimensional[mandala] of Kalachakra on thirty-five million seers and that the sub-sequent lords of the lineage [of Shambhala] conferred [the Kalachakrainitiation] in the same mandala. An additional reason for its suitabilityis that it is easier for persons of low faculties to imagine the form of acelestial palace with a tridimensional mandala than with a mandala madeof colored powders. Nevertheless, the reason that this method is notfollowed is due to such a mandala being difficult to build and thereforenot normally available. Furthermore, the tantras and commentaries,with some special exceptions, emphasize the use of mandalas of coloredpowders in the majority of cases. Moreover, the scriptures on disciplinestate:37If secure rituals are available, one should not rely on a looseprocedure.Consistent with this statement, it is generally not proper for one to usespecial [mandalas just] because one has the ability to actualize them.Furthermore, it is advisable for an ordinary master who cannot discernthe minds of students to adopt the gradual approach [appropriate] forthose of lesser fortune. In addition, if one has the means to do so, [toconstruct mandalas of colored powders] is a source of great merit. Con-sequently, an excellent system is that of the present day whereby mastersfirst confer on students the ripening initiation using mandalas of col-ored powders.38"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRATHE TANTRAS ENTERED THROUGH INITIATION [(2)]...The tantras are dividedAccording to emphasis on method or wisdom: father tantrascomprise three families;Mother tantras, six, of which the ultimate is the Kalachakra.Highest yoga tantra is divided into tantras that emphasize method andthose that emphasize wisdom to form two sets, father tantra and mothertantra, both of which may be subdivided. Father tantra, as explained inthe Indestructible Essence Ornament Tantra, is split into three tantras: thefamily of desire [tantras], family of aversion [tantras], and family of delu-sion [tantras].39 The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra mentions [six]:40The seals of the six universal sovereigns,Who are vajra-holders, kings of the families...Referred to in that citation are [the tantras of ] the six families: Akshobhya,Vairochana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, and the sixth,Vajradhara.41 Mother tantra also has six subdivisions, as set forth in theAbhidhanottara Tantra using their different names:42Alternatively, they are Vajrasattva,Vairochana, Vajraditya,Padmanarteshvararaja,Ashvottama, and Heruka.The ultimate of those six, the king of the tantras, is Kalachakra.43 The sub-divisions of the two [father and mother tantras] constitute the twelve sub-divisions of [highest yoga] tantras.

Thatbeing so, “mother tantras” refers to the particular sadhanas of the mandaladeities that extensively present the mandalas, mantras, and rituals of a hostof vajra female deities [who symbolize] wisdom.Mother tantras are of two families: tantras that teach in equal propor-tions both male and female deities [such as Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, andKalachakra]; and tantras that teach primarily the female type [such asChatuhpita].Other sources classify [highest yoga tantras] according to whether theyrepresent method or wisdom.

There are, as well, many systemsfound in the commentaries. However, the following explanation is basedon sources that are very renowned, such as the major works of the exalted[Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heirs [Aryadeva and Chandrakirti] and thoseof Abhayakara.To begin with, it is a serious failing for a master to confer initiation,perform consecration, and so on, without having first completed familiar-ization [with the deity]. Therefore, prior to the initiation, the master en-gages in familiarization for a [prescribed] time-period or number [of mantrarecitations],1 or [until] signs [of the deity arise]. When the time for confer-ral has come, the student makes a formal request, whereupon the mastershould again engage in familiarization for seven days or more to seek per-mission [from the deity] and should also perform the protection of thestudent. Following that is the initiation in the mandala of colored powders,explained in three parts: the ritual of the site, the preparatory ritual, and themain part.Concerning the first, the ritual of the site, Acharya Nagarjuna’s [Ritual ofthe Mandala of Guhyasamaja] states:2Clearing the site, blessing it,Taking possession of it, and protecting it.The ritual of the site is said to comprise four parts, prior to which the sitemust be examined [as to its suitability] and permission requested [to use thesite].The second, the preparatory ritual, is explained in four parts:The earth goddess, the mandala’s deities,The pure vases, and pure students:These belong to the ritual of preparatory acts.Concerning the third, the main part, [Nagarjuna] says:3"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002219The ritual of pitching the lines,Spreading of the colored powders, and...The procedure for the mandala prescribes the pitching of lines and spread-ing of colored powders, in addition to which is required the arrangement ofthe vases, the decoration of the mandala, and so on.4[Nagarjuna’s Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja states]:5The blessing of the mandala,The various acts of worship,The master’s own entry, and...This passage prescribes the actualization of the mandala, worship of it, of-fering of food, and the master’s entry into the mandala and receiving initia-tion therein.

To understand the points that are not explicitly mentioned inNagarjuna’s work [Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja], one must consultthe works of Nagabodhi and Abhayakara.The extensive applications, significance, and sequence of meditation as-sociated with the above mandala rituals should be learned from major works[on this subject].

Accordingly, Abhayakara extensively discusses the ritual,11 whichis to be carried out in the following way:Examination of the site means analysis in terms of its directions, colors,characteristics, earth, and water.12Requesting the site involves the request [for permission to use it] madeto a manifest being, the owner of the place such as a king; and to a non-manifest being such as the local guardian, the earth goddess, or both.13Clearing the site is carried out by digging up the site [commencing at thearmpit] of the uraga [naga] after having determined [its position].14 OnceFigure 6: Uraga: serpent-bellied earth-lord (extracted from the Sumpa Khenpo)"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002221the impurities [of the earth]15 are removed, a platform that meets prescribedspecifications is erected, and rituals of purification of the site through sub-stances, mantras, contemplation, and the highest [purification of empti-ness] are performed.16Taking possession of the site involves these steps: Once the house [orplatform] for the mandala has been constructed, in that place, the mastercontemplates the mandala [of the deities] and then seeks their permission[to draw the mandala]. Then, in response to the students’ request, the mas-ter, in order to raise the mandala [into the sky] and to subjugate demonicforces, separates himself from the chief [deity of the mandala] and assumesthe pride of being the appropriate [wrathful] deity,17 issues commands tothe obstructing forces [to leave], and expels them by performing the vajradance and stances.18Protecting [and blessing] the site is performed by generating the vajradagger, trapping all the obstructing forces that did not heed the commands[to leave] and striking with the dagger [in the four cardinal and four inter-mediate directions].19 In order to prevent the obstructing forces from en-croaching later, [the master] imagines a protective circle and then blesses[the site as vajra nature].20In a place that has already been used [for that purpose], examination ofthe site, digging [the earth], elimination of impurities, and so on, may bedispensed with. This does not mean that the ritual of the site is alwaysunnecessary; it is explained that the rituals for the site ought to be per-formed when appropriate. Therefore, on the right occasion, it is best todo all the other parts of the ritual as well. The ritual of the site is unneces-sary when the mandala is one painted on cloth, the mind mandala, or thebody mandala.21The second part, the preparatory ritual, comprises the three latter as-pects [mentioned above: mandala deities, vase, and students], which are setforth in most of the major tantras. The Samputa and the Net of MagicalManifestation,22 and masters such as Nagarjuna and his spiritual heirs teachin addition the preparatory ritual of the earth goddess.As to the sequence [of these preparatory acts], various systems have de-veloped, such as the preparation of the deities done after the preparation ofthe vases; the preparation of the students done once the mandala is drawn,and so on. The best order, however, would be the preparation of the earthgoddess first, then that of the deities of the mandala, followed by that of thevase, and then that of the students. Within this [order], it is good do thepreparation related to the earth goddess prior to [pitching] the action lines."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"222\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRANonetheless, Nagabodhi advocates performing [that preparation] after thepitching of the action lines [of the mandala].23The method for the preparation of the earth goddess comprises severalsteps. In the middle of [the site upon which] the mandala [will be drawn],one generates the earth goddess [of the pledge] and [imagines that] thepristine awareness deity merges with her. One then makes offerings andpresents food to the deity, asks permission [to draw the mandala], and [imag-ines that] she consents. Thereupon, one contemplates that she [dissolvesinto the site and] remains present as the essence of the earth.24The preparation of the mandala deities has been explained by many tobe done prior to pitching the action lines. However, the explanation byNagabodhi that it should be done after the pitching of the action lines is agood one. As to the method for doing this, the material, measurement, andblessing of the strings for pitching the lines should meet the specificationsprescribed for the ritual of the threads. One then pitches the action lines.25Once the spots where the deities [will be] have been determined, drops ofscented water are placed there. The mandala of the pledge [deities] is con-templated there, the mandala that was raised into the sky invited [to de-scend and merge with it], and initiation conferred [on the deities of themandala]. [The preparation is completed by] offering, praise, and supplica-tion [to the deities of the mandala].The preparation of the vase must be carried out according to the specifi-cations prescribed for their material, dimensions, number, insignia on thevase, substances contained, neck and mouth ornaments, and so forth.26 Oncethe vases are prepared, the pledge deities are generated within the vase, thepristine awareness deities merge with them, and initiation conferred on thedeities in the vase. The making of offerings, uttering of praise, reciting ofmantras, and so forth, must then be performed. Some tantric scriptures donot mention the insignia attached to the vase, their generation as deities,27and so on, owing to a difference between the extensive and concise treat-ments.The preparation of students must be performed according to the specifi-cations concerning the qualifications of the students, their number, purifi-cation with water, offering of the universe (mandala), and so on.28 These arethe steps to be followed: To inspire students’ interest in mantra and to makethem fit for initiation, [the master] adjusts their motivation and confers onthem the inner initiation.29 Students make [a threefold] supplication to themaster, who enjoins them to maintain a firm interest in mantra, and as-sume the vows so that their minds become receptive. The master then blesses"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002223their three places [forehead, throat, and heart].30 In order to analyze signs of[forthcoming] powers, each throws a tooth-stick [onto a square board].31To purify faults of speech, handfuls of water are given [for rinsing the mouthand drinking].

Some [tantras] do not mention the adjusting of motivation, theinner initiation, and so forth, owing to a difference between the extensiveand concise treatments.32According to some expositions, initiation rituals [based on] mandalaspainted on cloth, the mind mandala, or body as mandala are performedwith none of the preparatory rituals, while according to others, the prepara-tion of the vase and that of the students are done. However, it is good if thetwo preparations [of vase and students] are considered mandatory formandalas painted on cloth and the mind mandala, but dispensed with forthe mandala of the body.Next is the main part, which begins with the procedure for [drawing] themandala. The principal component of this ritual is the pitching of the pris-tine awareness lines in order to consecrate action lines which have beenpitched with a string [to which] colored [powders have been applied].33 Theaction lines are lines that have been pitched in advance [during the prepara-tion of the deities], or, as explained by many great tantric adepts, [the ac-tion lines] may be also pitched at this point.The pristine awareness lines are to be pitched while fulfilling specialrequirements concerning the thread’s material, number, color, and conse-cration, as well as the place where one stands [to pitch the lines], stance,way of moving around [the mandala], and so forth. The ritual for preparingthe colors, the substances of the colored powders, the colors, their consecra-tion, way of spreading the color, and so on, must meet the specificationsprescribed [in the tantras].34 When the mandala is finished, the vases arearranged, the mandala is decorated, the offerings items displayed, and soon. For [an initiation that uses a mandala] painted on cloth, one must knowhow to spread out the canvas, and other details; similarly, for mandalas ofmind and of body, [correct] placement of the vases must be known.What follow now are [the activities of the initiating master, which involve]the actualization and worship of the mandala and the performing of self-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAentry into the mandala. For all mandalas (with the exception of that of thebody mandala), one cultivates the yoga of self-generation as the deity, reci-tation [of the mantra], and [at the end] the dissolution [of oneself as thedeity]. Then, having generated the entire mandala in front, the preparatoryritual mandala [that was raised into space] is merged with the mandala ofcolored powders. The [mandala of the] pristine awareness deities mergeswith all of that, at which point one makes offerings, utters praise, and soforth, to the deities therein. Then, having completed the recitation of themantra associated with the deities generated in the vase, one presents theofferings of food to [the deities of ] the mandala and to the elementalspirits. Following these steps, one enters the mandala, takes the [four]initiations, and requests permission to have one’s students enter themandala.35As to the method of conferring initiation in the body mandala, one visu-alizes the body mandala (according to the sadhana) and generates the dei-ties in the vase and so forth. Next, one imagines that from one’s bodymandala, a replica separates; one enters that mandala and therein takes initia-tion. At the time of initiating the students, the two [mandalas] are unified.Some masters maintain that in front of the body mandala of oneself isvisualized what is like an outer mandala into which one enters and fromthere confers initiation on students. This procedure is not the one taught intantric scriptures.For the actual conferral of initiation, the procedure for the student’s en-try into the mandala is a close preliminary for initiation.36 First is the outerentry. In order to become a candidate fit for entering the mandala, the[blindfolded] student enters [the space] outside the curtain [or the house]of the mandala. To do that, one makes a request, dons the apparel [of thedeity], and, visualizing oneself as the deity, positions oneself at the easterndoor [having been enjoined to do so].37 There, one assumes the common[awakening mind commitments] and the uncommon [tantric] vows. Oneis asked [by the master who is inseparable from the deity] about one’s affin-ity and interest. Then, one generates the [awakening] mind of all-encom-passing yoga and is sworn to secrecy.38Next is the inner entry. In order to gain divine fortune, the student en-ters [the space] inside the curtain of the mandala.39 First, in order to gainouter divine fortune, one actually enters [the space] inside the curtain whileimagining to enter the divine palace through the eastern door, feels inspiredwith faith in the deities, circumambulates the deities of the mandala, and[imagines oneself ] prostrating to them. Then, in order to gain inner divine"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002225fortune, as it is necessary to safeguard the pledges which are the root [ofattainment] of powers, one becomes bound by oath by [assuming] the fouroaths.40 Following that is the descent of the pristine awareness deities [in-voked by the master] into the student and the procedure that stabilizesthem within oneself.41Next is the examination of what is seen [by the student] [in the spaceabove] the mandala to ascertain signs indicating what kind of power willbe attained. The student is then examined as to his or her suitability forbeing revealed the mandala and receiving initiation. If deemed a fit candi-date, in order to determine affiliation with one or the other of the [five]buddha families, he or she casts a flower [onto the square board whichsymbolizes the mandala] while repeating words of truth [after the mas-ter]. Thereupon, to create an auspicious connection so that the deity ofthe particular family will favor one, the student is initiated with a garlandof flowers.Finally, in order to inspire enthusiasm and give rise to great persever-ance in the attainment of mantric powers, one enters the mandala andactually sees it. This is done by the master’s directing one to remove theblindfold and look at the mandala, which is then described, whereuponone rejoices.THE ACTUAL CONFERRAL OF INITIATION [(b)]This section has two parts: the different types of initiations; and their cat-egories.TYPES OF INITIATIONS [(i)]Highest yoga tantra is generally considered to have four initiations. TheContinuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra 42 states:The first is the initiation of the vase;And the second, the secret initiation;The third, pristine awareness [through] wisdom,And the fourth itself, the same as that.43That citation serves as an example with which all sets of [highest yoga]tantras are in accord. There are said to be fourteen initiations in total, withthe vase initiation divided into eleven initiations, plus the three high initia-"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAtions. As to the way the vase initiation is divided into eleven, five are initia-tions of the student, and six, of the master. The five of the student are thewater, diadem, vajra, bell, and name initiations.As for the six initiations of the master, there seem to be various ways ofenumerating them. Ghantapa44 considers the six to consist of the main partof the master’s initiation, plus [five] appendages: the initiation of the man-tra; the prophecy [of one’s enlightenment] and the assurance [that one willbe free from the suffering of cyclic existence] (considered as one); the initia-tion of vajra deliberate behavior; the initiation of the deliberate behavior of[tantric] conduct; and the permission [to work for all beings through tantricmeans].Others explain that the six consist of the main part of the master’s initia-tion, preceded by the assuming of the three kinds of pledges [the mind pledgeof the vajra, the speech pledge of the bell, the body pledge of the seal];45 theinitiation of [the ten] essential principles [of tantric expertise] and their pro-cedures; permission; deliberate behavior; prophecy; and assurance.Yet others consider the six to consist of the main part of the master’sinitiation; the transmission of the mantra; plus the latter four, permission,[deliberate behavior, prophecy, and assurance]. Another assertion mentionsbestowal of the three pledges; the main part of the master’s initiation; plusthe latter four, the permission, and so on.Although in many explanations, the permission, [deliberate behavior,prophecy, and assurance] are considered to be parts of the master’s initia-tion, this is not so in all cases. In some systems, they are attached to the endof the initiations of the student, and in others, they are considered to be theappendage to the four initiations.Masters of the Ngog clan46 divide the vase initiation into eighteen partswhich in this case consist of five initiations of awareness, [conferral] of thethree pledges, five permissions related to the five families, prophecy, praise,assurance, master’s initiation, and deliberate behavior.This completes what is merely a synopsis of the different types of initia-tions. The point made in the major tantras is that there are two main typesof initiation: the vase initiation and the high initiations.THE VASE INITIATION [(aa)]The functions of the vase consist in the awareness initiations,the deliberate behavior, and so forth,The student’s initiations, and the irreversible wheel initiations."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002227The initiation known as vase initiation, which relates to the ritual acts per-formed with the vase, comprises the common initiations of the student andthe uncommon initiations of the master. The first are explained as follows:The water initiation [of Akshobhya] is conferred to establish the po-tency [for the recipient] to wash away the stains of ignorance.The diadem initiation [of Ratnasambhava] is conferred to establish thepotency to perform the seal impression by acting as the lord of the buddhafamily and to produce the crown protuberance, a major sign [of a buddha].The vajra initiation [of Amitabha] is conferred to establish the potencyto realize pristine awareness, which is indivisible from essential reality.The bell (or lord) initiation [of Amoghasiddhi] is conferred in order torealize the source of reality [emptiness], lord of the arising of the pristineawareness of indivisible emptiness and compassion.The name initiation [of Vairochana] is conferred to plant the seed for[receiving] the name of a buddha in the future.47The functions of the initiations of the student are explained as follows:The initiation of the flower garland [blessed by] mantra allows the stu-dent to know the buddha family to which he or she belongs.The water initiation establishes the potency for washing away the stainsof ignorance that create obscurations to the attainment of the state of abuddha of that family.The diadem initiation establishes the potency to be crowned with thebuddha who is lord of that family.The vajra initiation establishes the potency [to realize] the nondual pris-tine awareness which is the mind of the buddha in that family.The bell initiation establishes the potency for expounding, as a buddhaof that family, the 84,000 aspects of the doctrine.The name initiation establishes the potency, as a buddha in that family,for one’s name to be that of a buddha.The above explanation is that of Abhayakara. These are called “aware-ness initiations” because they lead to the attainment of the goal of aware-ness, the five pristine awarenesses, through relinquishment of the fiveemotional afflictions of ignorance (the object to be relinquished).48The uncommon initiations of the master are explained as follows:The pledge of the vajra is bestowed in order that [the student] not beseparated from nondual pristine awareness, the minds of all buddhas, or,alternatively, in order that he or she realize such pristine awareness.The pledge of the bell is bestowed so that one reaches the understandingthat all things are devoid of intrinsic nature."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"228\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe pledge of the seal is bestowed so that one may attain the state that isnever separate from the great seal of the deity’s body.The actual master’s initiation is bestowed so that one may attain [thestatus of ] “sovereign over the domain of the doctrine in the threerealms.”49The water initiation in this context is bestowed to wash away the stainsthat create obscurations to the attainment of the state of Vajrasattva.The [set of ] essential principles [of tantric expertise] is revealed so thatone may realize all aspects of the mandala of the support and the sup-ported [deities] as the nature of the qualities of enlightenment; the proce-dure of rituals is revealed so that one may perform the activities of a vajramaster.The mantra is transmitted in order to establish the seeds of the powersassociated with the four activations [of appeasement, etc.] and so that onemay create one’s own pure realm, which is the power of ultimate mantra.50The eye elixir is applied in order that the obscurations of the film ofunknowing be removed and the supernormal cognition of the divine eye beattained.51The mirror is given so that one may reach the understanding that allthings are devoid of intrinsic nature, like images reflected in a mirror.The bow and arrow are given to plant the seed [of the capacity] to strikethe target of the ultimate dimension of phenomena upon conquering thefour demonic forces.52The permission is given in order to create the potency for gaining pow-ers through the proper rituals and performing deeds and activities that ben-efit both oneself and others, such as teaching the doctrine.The deliberate behavior is given so that, on the basis of such factors asnever being separated from the awakening mind which is of the natures ofthe five pristine awarenesses, one may engage in mantric conduct.The prophecy is made in order to praise and uplift [the recipient] withthe words “As you are never without the established potency [to attain] abuddha’s name, you will be victorious on the earth, below, and in the realmsabove.”The assurance is given that [each of ] the different stages in the conferralof the initiation establishes a potency to attain buddhahood, which causesone to rejoice over the respective potency.The above explanations are, for the most part, that of Abhayakara. Thisset of initiations is called the “master’s initiation” since it leads one to [the"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002229state of ] sovereignty over the teachings; or the “irreversible initiation” sinceit establishes the irreversible seed [of the attainment of awakening].The mandala used for conferral of this [vase] initiation is one that com-prises the supporting mandala and the supported deities, a drawn one (suchas the colored powders or painted cloth), the body as mandala, and so forth.The basis for the initiation here is primarily the student’s body, which ispurified by removing its stains. The objective of the initiation is to establisha special potency for attaining the manifest dimension of a buddha and theperformance of its deeds and to actualize the body as the nature of theindestructible body of a buddha.Kalachakra sets forth seven initiations in the pattern of childhood.In the exceptional system of the glorious Kalachakra, the vase initiation iscalled the “seven initiations in the pattern of childhood.”53 As to their pre-cise number and order, the Primordial Buddha Tantra 54 states:O King, the sevenfold initiationIncludes, in their entirety, the initiationsOf water, diadem, silk ribbons, vajra and bell,Deliberate behavior, name, and permission.[The same tantra] states concisely:55Moreover, the elements and other constituents are purified.and then describes the purpose of the seven initiations in the followingwords:56The water [initiation] purifies the elements;The diadem [initiation] purifies the aggregates;The silk ribbons [initiation] effects the purity of the perfections;The vajra of the great immutable [bliss]And the bell of the continuous words of a buddhaPurify the solar and lunar [channels] as one;Through purification of the objects and sense powers,The vajra deliberate behavior of non-emission is developed;The name effects the purity of love and other qualities;"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"230\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe permission effects the purity of enlightenment itself;These are the seven initiations.57The Hevajra Tantra Five Hundred Thousand presents the analogies relatedto the “seven initiations in the pattern of childhood”:58[As if washing] their newborns, the mothers conferThe initiation of cleansing with water.The child’s hair bound on his headIs to securely fix the diadem.The piercing of his ears and adorning himIs called the initiation of the silk ribbons.The child’s talking and laughingIs the initiation of vajra and bell.His enjoyment is the deliberate behavior.Being named is the name initiation.Reading and writing is the permissionAlways given by the fathers.These seven parts, thus described,Are known as the seven initiations.59HIGH INITIATIONS [(bb)]In the body mandala, relative mandala, and ultimate mandala,The secret, wisdom, and fourth initiations are received.The high and supremely high ones are given at appropriate times.The three supreme initiations—the secret, pristine awareness [through]wisdom, and the fourth—are to be received, respectively, in the threemandalas: the body mandala, the relative mandala, and the ultimatemandala.60THE SECRET INITIATION [(1')]The secret initiation is conferred for the sake of creating the conditions forfaith and wisdom [in the student’s mind]."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002231To create the conditions for faith, one clearly imagines the master [andconsort] as the male and female deities and tastes the nectar of the bodhichitta[white and red vital essences] from their union. At that time, through thedeity’s power, one experiences an exceptional bliss, and thereby reversesdoubts and misconceptions about mantric practices.To create the conditions for wisdom, the secret substances [of bodhichitta],essence of all the buddhas, are placed [by the master] in one’s mouth, fromwhere they descend to the lotus of one’s heart. That causes one to realizeillusory body, which is pointed out by the twelve examples of illusion.61The essence of the secret initiation is that of the blissful contemplativestate which arises upon tasting the bodhichitta.Concerning the meaning of its name, “secret initiation,” it is so calledowing to it being an initiation conferred by means of the secret substances,the bodhichitta of the master and consort in union.As to the mandala for this initiation, conferral depends on the mandalaof the relative bodhichitta of the master and consort [in union], which isthe essence of all the buddhas melted. This initiation is primarily conferredon one’s speech, which is made pure by removing its stains. The objective ofthe secret initiation is to establish a special potency for attainment of theenjoyment dimension of awakening and to actualize speech as the nature ofthe indestructible speech of a buddha.THE PRISTINE AWARENESS [THROUGH] WISDOM INITIATION [(2')]The pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiation provides the examplethat indicates the actual innate [pristine awareness of bliss]62 introduced inthe fourth initiation. This initiation is conferred in dependence on a realconsort for the sake of entering the states of the four joys,63 innate pristineawareness in particular, through union with her.64 The student and consortunite as the male and female deities, and through the ensuing inner heat ofpassion, bodhichitta melts and flows to the various places [channel-wheels],generating the four descendent and four ascendent joys.65In the case of a student who is a monk, [instead of uniting with a realwoman,] he visualizes a pristine awareness consort,66 and imagines himself asthe male and female deities in union. Then, by applying the phases of con-trolling the winds, he ignites the fire of inner heat, the warmth of whichmelts the bodhichitta, thus bringing about the experience of the four joys.The essence of the third initiation is considered to be the experience of in-nate pristine awareness as the bodhichitta flows into the gem [tip of the penis]."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"232\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAs to the meaning of its name, “pristine awareness [through] wisdominitiation,” it is so called owing to it being an initiation that depends on awisdom woman—a real consort or an imaginary one—so that, through thefinest mind devoid of concepts [that arises], one is empowered in innatepristine awareness in dependence [on the consort].Concerning the mandala for this initiation, conferral depends on themandala of the bhaga of the consort. Initiation is conferred on the mind,which is made pure by removing its stains. The objective of the third initia-tion is to establish a special potency for attaining the reality dimension ofawakening and to actualize the mind as the nature of the indestructiblemind of a buddha.67THE FOURTH INITIATION [(3')][On the basis of ] the innate pristine awareness [ensuing] from the union ofthe male and female favored deities that occurs at the time of the thirdinitiation and serves as an example [for actual innate pristine awareness],the fourth (word) initiation is conferred in order to point out the actualinnate pristine awareness, the great seal possessing seven features.68To expand, what is principally introduced [in the fourth initiation] isthe selflessness of all phenomena, the nature of total sameness, the unborn,the essence of emptiness, or ultimate truth of luminous clarity. However,the aspect of the relative illusory body of the deity, the bliss of the [male andfemale deities in] union, and so forth, should not be held to be solely non-referential emptiness. In fact, the very pristine awareness [pointed out] dur-ing the fourth initiation is explained as the state of Vajradhara endowedwith seven features.That being the case, it would amount to a partial [understanding] tomaintain that the meaning [of this initiation] is the bliss of [the male andfemale deities in] union [pointed out] in the fourth initiation sealed byemptiness; or the bliss of the four joys, and so forth, as merely ungraspableawareness-emptiness; or the great seal of the deity’s form as merely the non-referential clarity-emptiness of one’s mind.Hence, the essence of the fourth initiation should be considered to bethe dimension of the union of bliss and emptiness of one’s body in theaspect of the enjoyment dimension of awakening; or the innate reality whichis the indivisibility of the bliss and emptiness of that dimension.As to the meaning of its name, “word initiation,” it is so called owing toit being an initiation that is conferred through words alone on those in-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002233clined to both the profound and vast truths. It is also known as “precious”because it is superior to the relative initiations.As to the mandala for this initiation, conferral depends on the mandalaof the ultimate mind of awakening. Initiation is conferred on the body,speech, and mind, whose stains and karmic traces are removed. Its objectiveis to establish [in the student’s mind] a special potency for attaining thedimension which is the very essence of the indivisibility of the three inde-structible states [of body, speech, and mind].The above explanation [of the four higher initiations] is from the per-spective of the common abridged tantras.69 The three supreme initiations[secret, pristine awareness through wisdom, and word] taught in the excep-tional Kalachakra tantra do have the same names [as those taught in othertantras], but are more profound and vast. They are distinguished in termsof their provisional and definitive meanings, and thus greatly superior byvirtue of their many different aspects. These will not be elaborated on atthis point for fear of [the explanation] being too lengthy. Likewise, in theKalachakra system, the initiation [to confer] the rank of the sovereignvajra master and the initiation [to confer] the rank of the great sovereignvajra master are known, respectively, as the high initiation and the su-premely high initiation. However, these are not to be conferred on individu-als in common but on those who have succeeded in the withdrawal andretention [branches of the sixfold yoga] onward, at the appropriate time.70CATEGORIES OF INITIATIONS [(ii)]All are included in the entrance, main part, and permission;Lesser and supreme; mundane and supramundane, and so forth.All of the rituals for the conferral of initiation may be included within threecategories: the entrance, the main part, and the permission as conclusion;or within the two categories of common lesser initiations and the uncom-mon high initiations; or the two categories of mundane initiations andsupramundane initiations, divided according to their results [i.e., commonor supreme powers]. “So forth” [in the root text] above refers to the catego-rization of rituals as relative and ultimate initiations, as presented in thePrimordial Buddha Tantra,71 or the categorization of the former three [com-mon, mundane, and relative] as causal initiations, and the latter three [un-common, supramundane, and ultimate] as resultant initiations, as presentedin the Essence of the Great Seal and the Indestructible Garland. 72"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"234\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAFUNCTIONS AND PURIFICATORY EFFECTS OF INITIATION [(c)]Initiations purify the obscurations of body, speech, and mind,and the three equally,Establish potencies for the four indestructible states, ripen oneas a fit traineeOf the generation phase, self-blessing, and example and actualpristine awareness,And bring about the attainment of the rank of a vajra master.The particular functions and purificatory effects of the conferral of the fourinitiations have already been mentioned in the course of the above discus-sion. Presented here, however, is a synopsis of those points for the sake ofclarity.The four initiations serve the following functions: to purify theobscurations of each of body, speech, mind, and the three together; to es-tablish potencies for [attaining] the four indestructible states of awakenedbody, speech, mind, and pristine awareness; to ripen [the student] so thathe or she becomes fit to cultivate the path, which comprises the generationphase, self-blessing,73 the example pristine awareness and actual pristineawareness.74 The permission and other parts of the initiations bring aboutthe attainment of the rank of a vajra master of the highest tantra system.To expand, in general, the main goal of the path of the highest yogatantra is the dimension of union possessing seven features. Throughout thestages that accomplish that goal, one must first relinquish [the conceptionof ] one’s ordinary form and train in [self-generation as] the body of thedeity. To that end, one must receive the vase initiation which [has the func-tion of ] cleansing the body of its stains and establishing the potency for theindestructible awakened body. To receive the vase initiation makes one fitto cultivate the generation phase by way of the three contemplations andtheir branches.75Subsequent to that, it is necessary to train in the illusory body76 associ-ated with relative [truth]. To that end, one must receive the secret initiation[which has the function of ] removing the stains of speech and establishinga potency for indestructible awakened speech. By receiving the secret initia-tion, one becomes fit to cultivate the phase of completion, which comprisesthe vajra recitation and other wind yogas, and self-blessing.77Next, one must train in luminous clarity emptiness. To that end, onemust receive the pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiation [which has"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"INITIATION\u0002235the function of ] removing the stains of mind and establishing a potency forindestructible awakened mind. By receiving this third initiation, one be-comes fit to cultivate the phase of completion of ultimate luminous claritydevoid of subject and object [duality].Finally, one trains in the union of the two [truths]: the illusory bodyassociated with the relative truth and the luminous clarity that has mergedwith essential reality78 associated with the ultimate truth. To that end, onemust receive the fourth initiation [which has the function of ] removingkarmic traces which are the stains of body, speech, and mind, and establish-ing a potency for the intrinsic dimension of awakening, which is the indi-visibility of three indestructible dimensions. By obtaining that initiation,one becomes fit to cultivate the phase of completion of the union of thetwo truths.Concisely stated, these initiations serve to remove the stains consistingof the faults that hinder meditation in the two liberative phases [of genera-tion and completion] one is cultivating and to establish the potencies toaccomplish whatever are one’s objectives. [This explains] the necessity offirst receiving initiation, which is the root of the [tantric] path.79On occasions, one actualizes an emanation mandala [i.e., a mind-cre-ated one] and from that receives initiation. Such a procedure is one thatgenerates a greater potency for the accomplishment of objectives throughthe contemplation of the two phases while removing the faults that hinderaccomplishment. It is known as the “initiation in the context of the path.”The initiations on the pattern of childhood correspond to thethirty-seven means of purification and spheres ofpurification.The seven initiations on the pattern of childhood in the Kalachakra Tantrahave as their grounds of purification the aggregates, elements, action facul-ties, sense powers, and their objects, and as their means of purification, thepurity of the thirty-seven elements (transcendent ones, bodhisattvas, shaktis,wrathful deities, and so forth).80 The correspondences between the groundsof purification and their purificatory means will not be elaborated upon atthis point, nor will the exceptionally profound meaning of the three highinitiations.Upon the completion of the rituals of initiation, the following activities areto be performed as the conclusion to the mandala, as explained by"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"236\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAbhayakara: the appeasing and enriching forms of the fire-offering rituals(to make amends for mistakes of excess or omission in the rituals and toplease the deity); worship of the mandala; accepting remuneration [for theinitiation]; making food offerings to the guardians of the directions, and soforth, outside [the mandala]; prostration to the mandala followed by thededication of merit; circumambulation of the mandala; asking forgiveness[for mistakes]; departure of the pristine awareness deity; dissolution of theemanated [i.e., pledge] deities; destroying the mandala of colored powders;extraction of the dagger [fixed in the ten directions]; carrying the coloredpowders to a river; and celebrating the occasion with a tantric feast gather-ing or by other means.81VOWS AND PLEDGES TO BE OBSERVED [bb'']The prohibitions concern root downfalls and secondaryinfractions;Injunctions concern contemplation, conduct, sustenance, andarticles not to be apart from;Pledges include those for beginners, adepts of stable realizationand highly stable realization,Or the pledges of indestructible awakened body, speech, andmind, and so forth.Once an initiation has been received, one must train in the pledges whichare the “life” of the initiation. Pledges belong, according to their essence, toone of two categories: prohibitions and injunctions.

The actual phase ofcompletion comprises innate great bliss born from the melting [of vitalessence];9 the illusory body [of the deity];10 the innate nature;11 the dimen-sion of the state of union;12 that which is attained at the end of the dissolu-tion of the winds in the central channel, the three thoroughly afflicted lightsand the three purified lights;13 the three joys;14 and the paths [that lead]directly to their attainment.The nominal phase of completion comprises the yoga of the channels,yoga of the winds, the subtle yoga, yoga of vital essence,15 and [practices"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"242\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAwith] a real or imaginary consort, which serve the function of making thewinds enter, dwell, and dissolve in the central channel.The completion phase with signs comprises the three lights with signs ofintrinsic reality, characterized by mind and mental events, and not yet fullytransformed into luminous clarity. This phase is present in all ordinary be-ings and others. The nominal completion phase with signs includes what-ever [aspects] are correlated with the conceptual mind associated with [genericimages of ] words and meanings. This phase is present in various degrees upto the point at which the actual luminous clarity is attained.The signless phase of completion comprises that which is without signsof intrinsic reality and is present only in [the minds of ] exalted beings. Thenominal signless phase of completion is present in [the minds of ] ordinarybeings as well.The pervading phase of completion comprises the branches of the six-fold yoga16 (withdrawal of the senses, etc.); the four joys; the four empties;and the absence of the appearance side, the emptiness side, and the blissside. It is [so called] because this phase pervades all those [types of ] phase ofcompletion.The pervaded phase of completion comprises the five stages of theGuhyasamaja;17 the four stages of the Chakrasamvara;18 the three of shape,mantra, and reality;19 the channels, winds, and vital essences;20 the fourseals;21 and the four yogas.22All aspects of the phase of completion are to be understood by means ofthe following eleven points of analysis: the essence of the [above] types ofcompletion phase; where in the body to strike crucial points; methodswhereby one strikes crucial points; ensuing experiences and signs; whichqualities are produced from these experiences and signs; reasons for suchexperiences; direct and indirect relinquishment of what is to be relinquished;measure of perfection; delineation of stages and paths; activities for over-coming obstructive forces and enhancing [realization]; and the distinctionbetween the principal and auxiliary [practices].The above points concerning the two phases of generation and comple-tion are, for the most part, covered in previous and subsequent sections [ofthe Infinite Ocean of Knowledge], such as those that treat the subject ofmeditation,23 and therefore will not be elaborated upon at this point. Ear-lier in this book, for instance, is presented [the nature of ] the body, whichserves as support, and its channels, winds, and vital essences, wherein onestrikes crucial points for different forms of the phase of completion. Thestages and paths are discussed in the relevant chapters.24"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"CONTEMPLATION\u0002243DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE COMPLETION PHASE IN THE GREATGALPO TANTRA [(ii)]This section has two parts: an overview; and a detailed discussion.OVERVIEW [(aa)]The completion phase comprises the causal and resultant phases.All of the teachings in the tantras of highest yoga concerning the differentcompletion phase systems, when presented in an abridged form in terms ofessence, are included within two aspects: the causal phase of completionand the resultant phase.DETAILED DISCUSSION [(bb)]This section has two parts: the causal phase of completion; and the result-ant phase of completion.THE CAUSAL PHASE OF COMPLETION [(1')]The section has two parts: the main topics; and an ancillary topic.THE MAIN TOPICS [(a')]The causal phase comprises self-blessing, mandala circle,And the great seal. ...The causal phase of completion has three principal aspects: self-blessing,mandala circle, and the great seal.SELF-BLESSING [(i')]Self-blessing denotes meditation for which the principal focuses—a flame,sphere, syllable, and so on—are visualized within the central channel (re-gardless of whether or not one actually visualizes the central channel).It is natural that winds gather wherever the mind is focused. Throughpractice of this meditation, the winds gather, whereupon they first enter,then dwell, and finally dissolve in the middle of the particular channel-"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"244\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAwheel one is focused on in meditation. When the winds dissolve, the pro-cess of dissolution of the different levels of subtle and coarse [psychophysi-cal] constituents25 occurs, along with many [experiences of ] extraordinarybliss [ensuing from] the melting [of vital essence].THE MANDALA CIRCLE [(ii')]The mandala circle denotes action-seal (consort) practice and an auxiliarypractice [using an imaginary seal].For the first, through controlling the life [wind that flows] in the upperpart [of the body],26 the sequence of the entering, dwelling, and dissolvingof the winds [in the central channel] occurs. When in union with an [ac-tual] consort, the point at which the winds are stopped is reached. At thattime, through the aid of the consort, the entering, dwelling, and dissolvingoccur simultaneously. As a result, great bliss, which is a bliss generated bythe melting of bodhichitta and its descending in the central channel, isswiftly induced.The four joys, which occur by way of striking the crucial points of one’sbody, can indicate in an approximate and partial way the different aspectsof bliss, emptiness, natures, and the lights. However, to indicate theseexperiences in a subtle and complete way requires that one rely on a realconsort. To explain, when one strikes the crucial points at various placesof one’s body, the pristine awarenesses that manifest are dissimilar, eachhaving a distinct mode of realization. There is also a difference dependingon the kind of consort, the difference being whether or not it is possibleto bring about the perfect pristine awareness of the four lights and thefour joys.The best among the consorts are the emissaries of the three places taughtin the Chakrasamvara tantra.27 Once one has gathered a special assembly ofthose consorts, in general, powers are bestowed with extreme swiftness. Inparticular, the channel-knots of the 21,000 channels are thereby released;the winds of the twenty-four transits cease;28 and the twenty-four residualvital essences transform into refined ones.29 Through the power of thesesupports [consorts], that which is supported by them, the pristine aware-ness of nondual bliss and emptiness, free from the wave[-like agitation ofconceptuality], expands to infinity. Indeed other kinds of consorts will gradu-ally bring this about, but the consorts [taught in Chakrasamvara] producethis result immediately, and are therefore the best among consorts.The auxiliary practice involves an imaginary consort, also known as “pris-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"CONTEMPLATION\u0002245tine awareness consort,” which serves the purpose of stabilizing the pristineawareness [of bliss and emptiness], and is an appearance in the form of aconsort created in one’s imagination. [This means] a thought-projected imagewhich appears although without concrete reality, referred to as the “self-manifesting awareness woman” or “great seal with form.”THE GREAT SEAL [(iii')]The great seal is of two [types]: the great seal that elicits bliss and the greatseal that directs the mind inward.In the first, once familiarization with pristine awareness coemergent withthe bliss of the melted [vital essence] has become very stable, [the adept]remains in a state of even contemplation of the bliss-emptiness pristineawareness alone. Such contemplation itself serves as the condition for thewinds and mind to gather [enter, dwell, and dissolve] again, whereupon aspecial bliss of the melted [vital essence] is experienced repeatedly: This iscalled “great seal without form.”In the second, the great seal that directs the mind inward, “mind” refersto both vital essence and discursive thought. Bodhichitta is directed intothe central channel, and discursive thought is caused to enter luminousclarity, whereupon, in a way greatly superior to meditation on emptinessalone, the dualistic impressions of apprehended and apprehender cease. Asa result, one becomes enveloped in the causal great seal which brings aboutthe supreme power, which is one’s desired power: the great seal of the nondualpristine awareness dimension of awakening.All these aspects of the phase of completion [self-blessing, mandala circle,and great seal] are called “causal phase of completion” since they serve ascauses of the pristine awareness of great bliss.ANCILLARY: THE FOUR SEALS [(b')]... As methods of eliciting bliss and emptiness,Generally, four seals are taught. ...All of the completion phase [practices] in highest yoga tantra are in accordin having as their objective the pristine awareness of the union of bliss andemptiness. Of the various presentations, extensive and condensed, of meth-ods to bring forth such pristine awareness, what follows now is in keepingwith the special synopsis just given."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"246\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAIt is generally taught that there are four seals—the action seal, doctrineseal, pledge seal, and the great seal—and this [system of four] is very widelyaccepted. These seals are defined in a number of different ways. [In his Awnof Esoteric Instructions],30 the master Abhayakara relies on many tantras inhis presentation [of the four seals] as they apply to three [stages]: the gen-eration phase, the completion phase, and the resultant [awakened stage].First, in the phase of generation, meditation on the manifest form of afemale deity is the action seal; the arrangement of syllables, the seal of thedoctrine; the performance of awakened activity through the emanation andreconvergence of light, and so forth, the pledge seal; and the appearanceand emptiness of the form of the deity, the great seal.Second, in the phase of completion, a real awareness woman is the ac-tion seal since she bestows joy through the action of embracing, and soforth. The central channel is the seal of the doctrine since it bestows thespecial innate joy. The pristine awareness of nondual bliss and emptiness isthe great seal since it is the unsurpassable mind of awakening. The imagi-nary consort, an appearance in the form of a female deity, is the pledgeseal.31Third, at the resultant stage, the manifest dimension of awakening is thepledge seal; the dimension of great bliss, the great seal; the reality dimen-sion of awakening, the doctrine seal; and the enjoyment dimension of awak-ening, the action seal.Alternatively, the four dimensions of awakening (manifest, enjoyment,reality, plus the great bliss dimension) are explained as being, respectively,the action, great, doctrine, and pledge seals. This is held to be the system ofthe Chakrasamvara tantra.On this subject of the four seals, the lordly Maitripa32 and his lineagebase their explanation on Nagarjuna[garbha]’s Ascertainment of the FourSeals,33 which they consider to express the view of the Hevajra tantra. Theaction seal is posited as both the actual action seal (the principal one) andthe pristine awareness seal, an imaginary seal (an auxiliary). The doctrineseal comprises the yogas of the winds, the vital essences, and the inner heat,and the [yoga practiced] by persons of superior faculties, that of the inde-structible [state], the focus of which is solely mind’s bliss. Accordingly,Sahajavajra’s Compendium of Tenets says:34The doctrine seal is cultivatedBy the less capable at the level of channels and letters;By the middling as the distinctive inner heat;"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"CONTEMPLATION\u0002247And by the best as the indestructible state.It is said to be the awareness that comprisesVital essences and subtle yogas.The great seal is natural, authentic pristine awareness, free from all concep-tual constructs. The pledge seal is the deity’s form which manifests withoutbeing mentally projected. This last has as its cause the enhancement andsealing practice in the generation phase,35 which is a concordant [seal]."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"248\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u000224914.

Taking as an example threeimages made of gold, their root, or nature, would be said to be the golditself, and the transformation of the gold, the three images. The gold thatforms the three images and the images themselves are not separable. Simi-larly, in this case, self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own na-ture] and the three lights are in no way separable.To expand, the three lights (without considering the distinction betweenthe real and the nominal) form two sets: the ultimate three lights of essen-tial reality and the relative three lights of interdependence.2THE ULTIMATE THREE LIGHTS OF ESSENTIAL REALITY [(1\")]The ultimate three lights of essential reality refer to the root, the ultimatedimension of phenomena, mind itself, immutable great bliss, ultimate andtotal self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature].Their essence is the mode of arising of the very form of that great bliss inits own appearing aspect. [Such is] the inconceivable secret of awakenedbody, speech, and mind: light, increase of light, and culmination of light,respectively, and the luminous clarity of total emptiness, all-pervasive greatbliss.Those three lights represent an inseparable and total sameness. Theyconstitute the ground, primordial reality; the result to be attained; and thereference for the cultivation of the path. They encompass all phenomena ofcyclic existence, perfect peace, and the path. Nonetheless, their essence tran-scends ground, path, and result.These three lights are not the actual ones but are called the three lightsbecause they are the very nature of the actual three lights."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002253THE RELATIVE THREE LIGHTS OF INTERDEPENDENCE [(2\")]The relative three lights of interdependence are known by the different namesof “three lights,” “three pristine awarenesses,” and “three consciousnesses.”These three lights form two sets: the three lights attended by conceptions;and the three lights devoid of conceptions.3 Here, “attended by” versus “de-void of ” indicates the presence or absence of the conceptions of emotionalafflictions.THE THREE LIGHTS ATTENDED BY CONCEPTIONS [(a\")]This first set is of two types: the three lights at the ground stage; and thethree lights at the path stage.THE THREE LIGHTS AT THE GROUND STAGE [(i\")][The set of ] three lights at the ground stage is of two types: the continuousthree lights; and the three lights that occur at particular times.4THE CONTINUOUS THREE LIGHTS [(aa\")]The three lights of essential reality explained above are inherent to all sen-tient beings, and yet, like an encrustation over them, the continuous threelights arise from the minds of each and every being.To expand, there is a habitual tendency to crave bliss which is possessedof a potency whereby mind is attracted to objects. Its three transformations,the appearances of body, speech, and mind, manifest through the potencyof mind’s self-cognizance, and are, respectively, light, increase of light, andculmination of light. The three are none other than the relative self-cogni-zant quality of mind and the aspect that looks inward.In other tantras [i.e., Kalachakra], these three lights are spoken of as theseed of mutable bliss or the bliss of emission [of vital essence]. The essentialnature of all of the three lights is that of the ground-of-all consciousness.However, in this context, light serves as the cause that produces the mentalconsciousness and the sense consciousnesses. The increase of light serves asthe cause for the afflicted mind. These two lights are thereby posited, respec-tively, [as the mental consciousness and sense consciousnesses; and afflictedmind]. The culmination of light, in a categorical sense, is simply of the natureof the ground-of-all, and only in an indirect way produces the [other] seven"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"254\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAconsciousnesses, not directly. It is therefore posited solely as the ground-of-all. Thus, the three lights are taught to be mind [ground-of-all conscious-ness], [afflicted] mind, and [sixfold group of ] sense consciousnesses.5These three lights, in essence not divisible and unified as one, remaincontinuously present as long as cyclic existence endures. They are desig-nated as the “three root lights.”THE THREE LIGHTS THAT OCCUR AT PARTICULAR TIMES [(bb\")]These are divided into four sets according to the time they occur: one, thethree lights, very evident and clear, that occur at the time of death; two, thethree lights, moderately evident and clear, that occur during sleep; three,the three lights, moderately evident and clear, that occur during sexual union;and four, the three lights, subtle and indistinct, that occur each time theappearances of the sixfold group [of consciousnesses] arise in coarse form.6THE THREE LIGHTS DURING THE DEATH PROCESS [(1))]Prior to the actual time of death, the twenty-five gross constituents7 dis-solve entirely. This process is accompanied by five signs, such as the mirage[indicating their dissolution].8[In particular,] when the winds dissolve into light, there occurs an innerwhitish radiance related to the white element [descending from the head tothe heart]. This is the pristine awareness of light.When that dissolves into the increase of light, there occurs a reddishradiance, [reddish] since it is related to the red element [ascending from thenavel to the heart]. This is the pristine awareness of the increase of light.As that dissolves into the culmination of light, the potencies of the whiteand red elements vanish into the totality [of space], and there remains onlya fraction of the life wind, owing to which there occurs a blackish radiance.This is the pristine awareness of the culmination of light.[What is described] here is the dissolution of the three lights associatedwith the particular time of death, not the dissolution of the root [continu-ous] three lights. [This is because] at the time of death, the luminous claritynature of mind is [still] covered by the encrustation of the ground-of-allconsciousness. Through the dissolution of the appearances of objects, thatground-of-all arises as the nature of bliss and clarity. From that arise thethree lights in reverse order, each in a momentary and subtle way, fromwhich occurs the intermediate state [between one life and the next]."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002255THE THREE LIGHTS DURING SLEEP [(2))]When one is asleep, there is no separation between the support, the bodywith its channels, winds, and vital essences, and that which is supported, themind. Consequently, just a fraction of the subtle and gross [constituents]dissolve, not the entirety. In this case, at the stage of the ground, the threefold[sequence] of light, increase of light, and culmination of light, which occursin the forward order, is extremely subtle and therefore difficult to recognize.When dreams occur, they do so from a subtle manifestation of the [three]lights in the reverse order. It is explained that in waking from the dreamstate, the lights do not again manifest in the reverse order, while in wakingfrom deep sleep, they do.THE THREE LIGHTS DURING SEXUAL UNION [(3))]During sexual union, first is experienced pleasure [based on] the four el-emental properties. Physical contact represents the earth element; moist-ness, water; warmth, fire; and movement, wind.9 Then, as the bodhichittapresent in the different channels reaches the secret channel-wheel, light oc-curs. As it reaches the groin region, the increase of light occurs. As it reaches,in the case of a male (method), the extremity of the “lord of the family”channel inside the gem [tip of the penis], or, in the case of a female (wis-dom), the extremity of the right channel [rasana], the culmination of lightoccurs. At the instant bodhichitta is emitted, there is luminous clarity. Fol-lowing emission, the red aspect ascends, and the three lights manifest in thereverse order.THE SUBTLE THREE LIGHTS THAT MANIFEST AT EVERY APPEARANCEOF AN OBJECT [(4))]To use an example, by the force of the mind being directed toward an ob-ject, initially there is simply a perception of the gross form: this is posited aslight. Next, there is ascertainment of the fine details of the form: this is theincrease of light. Then, as the mind becomes satiated by, or tired of, theobject, there occurs a slight diminishment of its clarity: this is the culmina-tion of light. Following that, the object no longer appears: this is the fourth,luminous clarity.Those are thereby posited as the three lights with respect to the mind’sclarity and cognizance components in one or another occasion. The three"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"256\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAlights that occur during sexual union are likewise posited with respect tothe clarity and cognizance aspects of the mind. That being the case, sincethoughts arise in dependence on the appearances of objects, and, as well,each and every appearance of an object manifests from the winds’ mode ofstirring the mind, therefore, in relation to [the arising of ] all objects [andthoughts], there exists a fraction of the three lights present at the time ofthe ground, which must be realized by means of the path. Hence, thereare five occasions for the arising of the three lights at the ground stage[continuous, at death, during sleep, sexual union, and at the manifesta-tion of all objects].THE THREE LIGHTS AT THE PATH STAGE [(ii\")]These form two sets: the three lights consisting of instants; and the threelights consisting of stages.THE THREE LIGHTS CONSISTING OF INSTANTS [(aa\")]This first set comprises [seven] sets: [one,] the three lights [experienced] atthe time of initiation; [two,] the three lights during the generation phase;[three and four,] the three lights arising from body isolation; and from vajrarecitation; and [five, six, and seven,] the three lights in the stages of mindisolation; illusory body; and luminous clarity.10THE THREE LIGHTS AT THE TIME OF INITIATION [(1))][During initiation,] the example pristine awareness is used in the path andthereby becomes a special method for ascertaining the authentic condition.It should be understood that, except for [that difference], these three lightsare similar to the three lights at the time of sexual union, and arise in thesame way.There are four different kinds of pristine awareness [of initiation]: thepristine awareness of the initiation that is introduced to persons of lowfaculties (beginners); the pristine awareness [of the initiation] that ripenspersons of sharp faculties, who fathom [pristine awareness] without goingthrough stages; the pristine awareness of the initiation in the context of thepath consisting of the two phases [of generation and completion]; and thepristine awareness of the initiation that serves as the proximate cause for theresult [awakening].11"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002257Of these four, in this context, the pristine awareness of the initiation[introduced to] the beginner with low faculties should be considered to bethe three lights at the time of initiation.THE THREE LIGHTS DURING THE GENERATION PHASE [(2))]During the phase of generation, the three lights are exemplified by thosethat ensue from the passion engendered with a real or pristine awareness[imaginary] consort. In addition, three lights manifest from focusing onsubtle spheres in the profound phase of generation.THE THREE LIGHTS OF BODY ISOLATION AND VAJRA RECITATION[(3)), (4))]As to the three lights arising from body isolation and vajra recitation,12when the winds, owing to different meditation focuses and exertion [inbreath-control techniques], gather to some extent, the gross constituentsdissolve slightly. Thereafter, the pristine awareness of the three lights mani-fests for a time, however brief or extended, after which one awakens [fromthe absorption], accompanied by subtle components [of the three lights]manifesting in the reverse order.THE THREE LIGHTS OF MIND ISOLATION, ILLUSORY BODY, ANDLUMINOUS CLARITY [(5)), (6)), (7))]Practitioners at the stages of mind isolation, illusory body, and luminousclarity13 will attain the three lights through the stages of applying the prac-tices. Except for differences in intensity and refinement, the ways the lightsmanifest will be the same as those [of body isolation and vajra recitation].The three lights that occur as the result of [having perfected] practice repre-sent the actual stages of the three lights.At the mind isolation stage, during each session of equipoise, the eightymanifest conceptions are stopped. As a result, the practitioner has the im-pression that the pristine awareness [experienced] during that session en-compasses all phenomena, but in fact it does not do so. In addition [to thatexperience of pristine awareness], a practitioner at the stage of illusory bodywill experience an infinity of appearances of mandalas. A person at the stageof luminous clarity will have a similar experience and, in addition to theappearance of all the [infinite] mandalas, will realize everything to be of the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"258\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAnature of bliss. The three lights of actual awakening encompass all phenom-ena (as will be explained below).Concerning the way to practice those, during the manifestation of thethree lights at the stage of the ground, in accordance with the way they existat the ground, it is necessary to strike the crucial points by means of [tech-niques of ] the path. Therefore, one cultivates bliss [in practice] with anaction seal (real consort) or pristine awareness seal (imaginary consort); cul-tivates the state of non-thought through the yoga of sleep; and cultivatesthe pristine awareness of clarity by relying on methods complementary tothe first two, such as yogas involving syllables, spheres, vajra recitations,and winds. Except for differences in which is the main experience, the three[experiences of ] bliss, [non-thought, and clarity] all ensue from the threemethods (the action seal, [yoga of sleep, and yogas of syllables, etc.]).The ability to use the luminous clarity of death on the path is gained byintegrating the meditative absorption of luminous clarity with sleep in thepresent life. Although one may not gain powers in this lifetime, when deathcomes, one will be able to use the moment [of death] in the path. The threelights that manifest at every object’s appearance in the ordinary state are tobe cultivated in the post-contemplation period of [everyday] activities.THE THREE LIGHTS CONSISTING OF STAGES [(bb\")]By means of the methods mentioned above, the three lights of instants arerepeatedly elicited and contemplated. As a result, the pristine awareness ofbliss and emptiness that has been cultivated in relation to the three lights atthe ground stage is firmly stabilized. This process is comparable to treatingcopper with mercury and cow dung to produce gold.To explain, through repeated practice related to the three lights of in-stants, one first ripens the potency for the meditative experience of light,then that of increase of light, and then that of the culmination of light. Onethereby gradually progresses from the stage of light to the stage of increaseof light, from that to the culmination of light (inclusive of the subparts ofeach stage), and [finally] experiences the total emptiness stage.THE THREE LIGHTS DEVOID OF CONCEPTIONS[(b\")]The three lights at the stage of actual awakening14 constitute the [medita-tive] application directed to relinquishment of the seeds of the conceptionsof the eighty natures. The seeds have therefore not yet been relinquished."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002259However, these three lights are included in this set of three lights that aredevoid of conceptions because they are conducive to [the attainment of ] them.The [actual] three lights devoid of conceptions refers to the three lightsthat occur in the reverse order when one has emerged from [the equipoiseof ] the path of seeing and to the lights that manifest as a result of thepassion of great pristine awareness from the attainment of the stage of uniononward (which belong to the category of three lights of instants). Theselights consist in the repeated cultivation of great bliss which is “moistened” bya subtle bliss derived from the melting [of the vital essence]. Their character-istics bear only a resemblance to those of the three lights of mind isolation.Moreover, it should be understood that, in terms of their principal char-acteristics at least, the three lights at the ground stage that occur at particu-lar times are considered to be similar in that [light] is mainly concordantbliss, [increase of light,] mainly clarity, and [culmination of light,] mainlynon-thought.Thus are delineated fifteen sets of three lights: the one set of the ultimatethree lights of essential reality; and the relative, the five at the ground stage,the seven plus the one comprising stages at the path stage, and the one ofthe three lights devoid of conceptions.There are many synonyms for the three lights, some common to bothsutras and tantras, and others exclusive to the tantras. The following areexamples of just some of the terms used to designate light, increase of light,and culmination of light, respectively: method, wisdom, and androgyne;mind [ground-of-all consciousness], [afflicted] mind, and [the sixfold groupof ] consciousnesses; desire, aversion, and delusion; imaginary, dependent,and absolute. [These are in common with the sutras.][The next are terms used in tantra]: appearance side, emptiness side, andtheir union; mind, mental events, and ignorance; absence of desire [aver-sion], desire, and middling desire; empty, very empty, and total empty (theseare not actual synonyms but just names given in consideration of their simi-larities); three lights, three emptinesses, and three consciousnesses; and pris-tine awareness, mind, and consciousness (these are actual synonyms).15Next, to explain the meanings of some of those names, since light hasthe smallest component of the bliss of desire, it is called absence of desire[aversion]. Since the increase of light has a greater component of bliss, it iscalled “desire.” Since the culmination of light has equal proportions of blissand emptiness, it is called “middling desire.”To explain some other synonyms, light is posited as wisdom since, of thetwo aspects of emptiness and bliss, it has a greater component of emptiness."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"260\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe increase of light is posited as method since it has a greater componentof bliss. The culmination of light is considered as androgyne since it hasboth equally.Moreover, light is referred to by the following symbolic [terms]:16 [thesyllable] om, moon, lotus, woman, left side, night, smoothness; the in-crease of light, by [the syllable] a, sun, vajra, jewel, day, man, right side, androughness; and the culmination of light, by neuter, points between [nightand day], center [of left and right], middle [of a space], androgyne, and union.CONCEPTIONS [(bb')]The thirty-three conceptions, the nature of which is light,Forty, the increase of light, and seven, the culmination of light,serve as the sourceOf deception and freedom. ...The conceptions arising from the three lights17 generally amount to all typesof discursive thoughts. To establish their exact number is therefore difficult.There are many enumerations, such as that of the Indestructible GarlandTantra, which names one hundred and eight winds, the nature of which isconceptions.18. The root source for the particular associations of the con-ceptions with the three lights is found in the Compendium on the PristineAwareness Tantra, which sets forth seven conceptions related to the culmi-nation of light; four associated with the increase of light; and only [the one]absence of desire [aversion] associated with light (although there are actu-ally seven associated with light). There are various ways of pointing out how[the conceptions and the three lights] are associated. However, since theexplanation in terms of eighty conceptions as found in the exalted Nagarjuna’sFive Stages is so well known, what follows will be in keeping with that.Nagarjuna’s work sets forth the thirty-three conceptions associated with light,[beginning with the words]:19Aversion, middling aversion...20Here, the first is the absence of desire, in essence, aversion, which meansapprehending an object as unpleasant. This is differentiated into three typesaccording to the degrees of intensity of the aversion. [The thirty-three are asfollows:]"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002261(1) Small aversion, whose mode of apprehension [of the object] is slightlyunclear;(2) Middling aversion, whose mode of apprehension is clear, but owingto its being brief, and to other factors, is not capable of initiating aconditioned action;(3) Great aversion, whose mode of apprehension is clear and lasts sometime and therefore is capable of initiating a conditioned action;(4) Mental coming and going: mind directed outward towards an objectand then directed inward (both refer to mind being directed);(5) Sorrow,(6) Middling sorrow,(7) Great sorrow: three degrees of distress caused by being separated fromapleasing object;(8) Quietude: a dazed state resembling that of fatigue or exhaustion whichlacks mindfulness;(9) Conceptuality: discrimination that apprehends attributes by mixing[the generic image based on] names with that [derived from a senseperception] of an object;(10) Fear,(11) Middling fear,(12) Great fear or fright;(13) Craving,(14) Middling craving,(15) Great craving: three degrees of longing for what is pleasing to one inthe past, present, and future;(16) Grasping: the wish to indulge in what is craved for;(17) Hunger and thirst: mental discomfort caused by these;(18) Feeling,(19) Middling feeling,(20) Great feeling: in essence, pleasure, pain, and neutrality, distinguishedinto three types based on the different degrees of intensity.(21) Conception of knowing,(22) Conception of a knower,(23) Conception of an object known: the mistaken cognitions that appre-hend the three (actual knowing, the agent of knowing, and the groundof apprehension) for what they are not;(24) Discernment: analyzing what is suitable and unsuitable;(25) Shame: of being immoral, or not wishing to become immoral;"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA(26) Shunning unwholesome deeds out of concern about others’ disapproval.[The mental factor of ] embarrassment is also included in this.(27) Compassion: the wish that others be free from suffering;(28) Loving-kindness,(29) Middling loving-kindness,(30) Great loving-kindness: three degrees of love and affection whereby onewishes for the happiness of other sentient beings whom one findspleasing. These are also explained as three degrees of wishing for thehappiness of attractive beings and wanting to protect them from harm.(31)Qualm: an unsteady disposition related to uncertainty and character-ized by anxiety.(32) Accumulation: wanting to collect [things] and reluctance to give[things] away out of avarice.(33) Jealousy: a mind disturbed by others’ prosperity.[Next are] the forty conceptions associated with the increase of light:(1) Desire for an object not yet acquired;(2) Attachment to an object already acquired;(3) Joy,(4) Middling joy,(5) Great joy: different degrees of delight at the mere sight of a pleasingobject;(6) Rejoicing: joy at having achieved what one desires;(7) Rapture: repeated enjoyment of the desired object;(8) Amazement: elation over something newly attained;(9) Excitement: mind pursuing what is pleasing;(10) Satisfaction: being content with pleasure;(11) Desiring to embrace (this stands for the wish to engage in physical andverbal actions motivated by desire for an object);(12) Desiring to kiss: (this stands for the wish to engage repeatedly in ac-tions [motivated by] desire);(13) Desiring to cling: (this stands for the wish not to give up these actionsmotivated by desire);21(14) Stability: an stable disposition that cannot be changed;(15) Diligence: enthusiasm for the practice of virtue;(16) Pride: considering oneself to be superior due to family or other fac-tors; this includes the seven types of pride;22(17) Activity: the will not to relinquish the effort to bring tasks to comple-tion;"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002263(18) Robbery: wanting to possess the things of others;(19) Force: wanting to suppress others;(20) Enthusiasm: mind’s involvement in ordinary activities;(21) Forbearance of hardship,(22) Middling forbearance of hardship,(23) Great forbearance of hardship: different degrees of indomitable cour-age when it is necessary to apply oneself to difficult tasks. (For this,[the translators of Nagarjuna’s Five Stages], based on a corrupted [San-skrit] text, have mistakenly taken sahasa (hardship) for sahaja (in-nate).23 Therefore, [in choosing] between a doubtful translation andan edited [but meaningful] one, the second is preferable).(24) Vehemence and aggression: wanting to quarrel, and so forth;(25) Flirtation: mind directed toward what is beautiful;(26) Animosity: a mind of enmity;(27) Virtue: rejoicing in virtue;(28) Lucidity: wishing to be understood by others;(29) Truth: wishing to speak the truth;(30) Untruth: wishing to tell a lie;(31) Certainty: maintaining a steady resolve;(32) Non-assumption: not wishing to possess something out of consider-ation of the grief this may cause;(33) Donor’s disposition;(34) Exhortation: wishing to urge others into work and action;(35) Heroism: wishing to be free from obscurations;(36) Shamelessness: not shunning the unwholesome;(37) Deceit: the wish to mislead others;(38) [Wickedness]: adherence to the bad views of evil persons (the five badviews);24(39) Rudeness: disregarding and scorning others, even when their status,health, or possessions decline;(40) Dishonesty: guile in hiding one’s faults.The seven conceptions associated with the culmination of light are as follows:(1) Ignorance that is a medium veil of desire: the result of the mind beingclouded by desire (the cause); it is “ignorance” since its aspect isunclear;(2) Forgetfulness: a diminishment in mindfulness;(3) Confusion: apprehending what is big as small, form as sound, and soforth;"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"264\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA(4) Disinterest in speaking: not inclined to speak;(5) Discouragement: overwhelmed by circumstances of any kind;(6) Indolence: lack of interest in what is wholesome;(7) Doubt: oscillating between two possibilities.These are the seven instants of ignorance.The eighty conceptions have as their [primary] causes the three rootconsciousnesses and the three root winds,25 and, as their contributory con-ditions, the three lights that occur at particular times, accompanied by theirwinds. When these [causes and conditions] encounter the contributory con-ditions of external objects, concordant conceptions arise. However, thesedo not arise from the three lights of the path. All of the various conceptionsarise from potencies which are nurtured by winds. Although potencies ripe[for producing conceptions] are always present, the numerous manifest con-ceptions do not arise simultaneously, nor do they necessarily arise all in oneday. The conception that arises is the one closely related to the contributorycondition.These conceptions are exactly what are to be relinquished [on the path].Therefore, the main conceptions [to be relinquished] are not the virtuousones; the main ones are the emotional afflictions. Of those, the principalones amount to the three poisons [of aversion, desire, and ignorance]. Aver-sion is the principal of the conceptions attendant to light; desire, the prin-cipal of the conceptions attendant to the increase of light; and ignorance,the principal of the conceptions attendant to the culmination of light. Theirmode of dissolution is therefore the most important aspect of which to gainexperience, as is explained in the authentic esoteric instructions.In the first group [of conceptions], aversion appears at the beginning,and since many [conceptions of this group] are similar to aversion, earliermasters spoke of these as the thirty-three conceptions of aversion. In thesecond group, since many of the conceptions are related to desire, they weretermed the forty conceptions of desire. In the third group, most of theconceptions are similar to ignorance; thus, they were termed the seven con-ceptions related to ignorance.Division of the eighty conceptions in terms of day and night yields onehundred and sixty. The terms “day” and “night” refer to the division intomethod and wisdom, which is the distinction in terms of the relative andthe ultimate.Of those conceptions, the principal are ones that have the natures of thesix root emotional afflictions.26 They are perpetrators of the karmic actions"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002265that propel and complete,27 and therefore serve as the root of birth in cyclicexistence. From the stage of the ground, the conceptions are in nature emptyin that they originate from and dissolve into bliss and luminous clarity.When such nature is used in the path and [these same conceptions] dissolveinto luminous clarity, they become the special cause for [the attainment of ]liberation. Consequently, they represent the border where cyclic existence iseither entered or shunned. Thus, one should exert oneself in [using theirnature in] the path.THE WAY PRISTINE AWARENESS MANIFESTS FROM CONCEPTIONS [(cc')]... Pristine awareness is brought forth by method.This is explained in two parts: the actual way pristine awareness manifests;and the conditions contributing to its manifestation.Concerning the first, when the winds that serve as mounts for the thirty-three conceptions dissolve, the conceptions themselves dissolve, at whichpoint light manifests. Next, the forty conceptions and their winds dissolve,whereupon the increase of light manifests. Then, the seven conceptionsassociated with delusion, along with their winds, dissolve, and the culmina-tion of light manifests. That dissolves into full culmination,28 the fourthmoment of which dissolves into luminous clarity.The conceptions associated with the increase of light are said to dissolveas soon as light manifests; conceptions associated with the culmination oflight dissolve at the time of the increase of light. Some scholars assert thatfirst the conceptions dissolve and then the three lights manifest. As to theirmanner of dissolution, they posit that initially the twenty-five gross con-stituents (in groups of five each) dissolve. Many of the earlier masters main-tain that first the twenty gross constituents dissolve, followed by the dissolvingof the five elemental properties. At the end of the dissolution of all theseelements, the process of dissolution of the conceptions and the lights oc-curs. One should gain an understanding [of these points] from the otherextensive works that examine this subject conclusively.As for the second, the conditions contributing to its manifestation, pris-tine awareness arises from the gathering of the winds and mind in vitalessence primarily within the central channel at the heart center. [Related tothis are two points:] first, the way pristine awareness is brought forth bymeans of external and internal techniques; and second, based on that, theway bliss and emptiness are integrated."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAFirst, all of the [techniques in the] phase of completion related to theupper door [of the central channel] can cause the winds to enter, dwell, anddissolve in the central channel, and thereby bring forth the three lights thatare concordant with [the actual ones]. This is because these [techniques] arecapable of eliciting all of the actual four joys [arising] from the vital essencemelting within the avadhuti.To manifest the actual three lights, one must use [a technique] to strikethe crucial points at the heart, such as the vajra recitation, inner heat [yoga],vital essence [yoga], and the vase[-like breath retention]. This is because thedissolution of the winds and vital essence at the heart serves as the cause forthe manifestation of the actual three lights. Nevertheless, the three lightsthat are mind’s focus29 cannot be generated until the channel-knots [thatconstrict] the central channel at the heart are released. Once the knots arereleased, there occurs the three minds of pristine awareness cultivated bythe various aspects of the phase of completion: these are the three lights thatare mind’s focus.One may wonder whether or not these [methods] alone have the capac-ity to perfect the mind isolation [stage of the completion phase]. The an-swer is that they do not. To perfect that one must rely on an external consort,as pointed out in the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness[Tantra]. The clear indication of the dissolution of all conceptions, the fullmanifestation of the three lights, and the full manifestation of the four joysabsolutely require a consort.One should understand that, generally, to attain a body [made only] ofwind and mind is dependent on the three lights; and to transform the gross[twenty-five] elements is dependent on the descent and reversal [of vitalessence].Second is the integration of bliss and emptiness with all three lights andfour joys. The full culmination of light, a state of unconsciousness, is amind that does not arise in the form of any conceptual construct, and thatabsence of constructs in itself is emptiness. Thus, the full culmination oflight represents the completeness of bliss and emptiness. One should gainan understanding of this and related points from other extensive works thatexamine this subject conclusively.APPEARANCE SIDE [(ii')]The essence of the appearance side is the form of a completionphase deity"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002267Of three types. From the four lights and the four elementalpropertiesThe subtle and gross constituents are created. The innate bodyserves as the ground for attainment.The agent of attainment is the final example luminous clarity.The essence of the appearance side is the form of a deity [which manifests]in the phase of completion, along with a [form] concordant to that, ofwhich there are three [aspects]. [First is] the completion yoga: through thecontributory condition of the mind being blessed by the ordinary bliss fromthe melting [of vital essence] and by the force of deity meditation, while ina state of non-thought, there manifests the form of a deity as a vivid appear-ance. [Second is] the illusory body self-blessing, the form of the deity com-posed of wind and mind only. [Third is] the yoga with signs, which consistsin visions such as smoke.30Of those, it is necessary that the illusory body be understood in detailand will therefore be treated in a subsequent section [of the Infinite Ocean ofKnowledge]. What follows now is simply an overview of the subject.As a general explanation of the nature of cyclic existence, eight factors—the four lights of the mind and the four elemental properties of the body—determine the unfolding and the ceasing of cyclic existence. When a beingwith a body of gross constituents dies, the elemental properties, in theirsequence of the subtle and gross, dissolve, whereupon the three lights alsogradually dissolve, and the being enters luminous clarity. As one emergesfrom the luminous clarity, the culmination of light, increase of light, andlight arise as the four elemental properties, wind, and so forth, and thus, thegross appearances of this [life] arise. Accordingly, as soon as one emergesfrom the luminous clarity of death, the intermediate state begins. Afterthat, one enters the next existence, turning in an unceasing circle.The subtle and gross constituents created by those causes and con-tributory conditions [are set forth] from the perspectives of body, mind,and both.The first, body, comprises one’s own body of flesh, bones, blood, and soforth (the gross constituents); the stationary channels, moving winds, andthe sited vital essences (bodhichitta) (the subtle); and winds of five-coloredlights (the very subtle).The second, mind, comprises the five sense consciousnesses (the gross);mental conceptual [consciousness] and the eighty conceptions (the subtle);and the four lights (the very subtle)."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"268\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe third, both mind and body, comprises the twenty-five “natures,”which refers to the five aggregates (form, etc.), the five elements (earth,etc.), the five sense faculties (the eyes, etc.), the five objects (visual forms,etc.), and the five pristine awarenesses at the ground stage (mirror-like, etc.)(the twenty-five gross); the conceptions and the winds that serve as theirmounts (the subtle); and the four lights and the winds that serve as theirmounts (the very subtle).Of the five pristine awarenesses, the mirror-like pristine awareness[of the ground] is considered to be the radiant clarity of the mind; thepristine awareness of total sameness, the awareness of feelings; discern-ing pristine awareness, the understanding of terms and their meanings;the pristine awareness of accomplishment, the desire to undertake ac-tivities; and the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phe-nomena, objects not appearing clearly. Consciousness [in the context ofthe five aggregates] is identified as the consciousnesses of the five doors[sense faculties].The gross body made from those constituents is repeatedly discarded[within cyclic existence] and is therefore not the innate body. The unceas-ing and innate body is that of wind and mind; that is to say, the unimpededclarity aspect of the mind, along with its support or mount, wind. Owingto the presence of this very subtle body, gross forms of body are assumed.When a gross body is discarded [dies], the subtle body remains. Again, agross body is assumed, [a pattern] like a turning wheel. All of the subtle andgross constituents [mentioned above] follow the same pattern. That beingthe case, the ground for the attainment of the illusory body is the innatebody itself. The causal condition that contributes to its attainment is statedin the Five Stages:31The pure body, which is like a rainbow,Is attained by contemplation of reality.Thus, it is taught that, generally, the illusory body is attained through con-templation of essential reality, which is the inseparability of bliss and emp-tiness. The agent that directly effects the attainment of the illusory body isthe final example luminous clarity, termed the “final luminous clarity ofmind isolation.”When such luminous clarity is experienced, in the second moment, theawakened body of mind and wind is attained. That final example luminousclarity manifests just like the luminous clarity does in the process of disso-"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002269lution at death. The luminous clarity of death causes the separation of the“fully ripened” [karmic] body from wind and mind. Likewise, the finalexample luminous clarity is designated as “that which separates the two.”Its essence, the indivisibility of one’s own life wind and mind, actually be-comes the body of the deity. What kind of mind is this? It is the ground-of-all [consciousness], along with the mental [consciousness], blessed by thethree lights.The essence of the illusory body is defined as the combination of two:[one,] the special mind (the supported) which, transformed by the bliss ofthe three consciousnesses [i.e., the three lights], manifests as the appearanceof the deity; and [two,] wind (the support for this mind), which, throughsuch manifestation, also becomes the form of the deity. This is termed “im-pure illusory body” since at the present time the obscurations of emotionalafflictions have not yet been overcome. It is illustrated by twelve examples,the magical illusion, moon reflected in water, and so forth.32UNION OF EMPTINESS AND APPEARANCE [(iii')]Actual awakening is the cause; the state of union, the result.[There are several points] concerning the completion phase of union: itscause, that of actual awakening; support, the impure illusory body; essence,the pristine awareness that has relinquished the seeds of the eighty concep-tions, the essential nature of the path of seeing, which is seeing anew whathad not been seen, the true nature of reality, the pristine awareness whereindualistic appearances have ceased; the way of entering [this state of union]by relying on the outer and inner actual awakenings;33 and the resultantattainment of the state of union of training and beyond training. Thesetopics will be treated in detail in subsequent sections [of the Infinite Oceanof Knowledge].34In summation, the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness [which arises]upon the dissolution of winds and mind in the central channel is the comple-tion phase on the emptiness side. The appearance of the deity’s body, blessedby such pristine awareness, is the completion phase on the appearance side.These two [pristine awareness and the body of the deity] being of one es-sence is the state of union.The appearance side comprises three [aspects]: [the deity’s body] thatmanifests only to the mental consciousness; the body composed of windand mind; and the pure body of pristine awareness. The emptiness side"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"270\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAcomprises three [aspects]: the three lights that appear to a beginner in thecontext of the path; mind isolation; and luminous clarity.These represent very important points in all highest yoga tantras. Inparticular, in the Guhyasamaja Tantra, the principal topics whose meaningsare as vast as space are the three: illusory body, luminous clarity, and state ofunion. These are somewhat elaborated upon, where appropriate, in previ-ous and subsequent sections [of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].THE APPLICATION OF TANTRA [dd\"]This discussion of tantric application has two parts: activations; and comple-mentary tantric conduct.ACTIVATIONS [(1)]Application of tantra comprises the twelve great activationsAnd the common and supreme powers, achieved by means ofmeditation,Fire offering, diagrams, and compounds. The practice toachieve the four ordinary powersIncludes direction, time, deity, necessary articles, disposition,Place, meditation object, food, ritual, and mantra;Uncommon substances and pledge articles are superior meansto attain powers.Tantric application comprises both the tantras of activations and tantras ofpowers. The first includes the twelve great activations35 and other activa-tions. The second includes both common and supreme powers. The com-mon are the minor powers such as the eight powers; middling powers, thatof the status of an ordinary awareness-holder in the desire realm; and greatpowers, one’s life span, body, and wealth experienced for an infinite num-ber of aeons in the status of an awareness-holder of the realm of desire; andthe status of an awareness-holder in the form realm.36The main tantric applications to carry out those [activations and pow-ers] are of four [types]: meditative absorption activations, fire-offering activa-tions, yantra37 activations, and the activations of the preliminarypreparations.38 The practice to achieve the four ordinary powers, the ob-jectives of those activations, includes ten features: direction, time, deity,necessary articles, disposition, place, meditation object, food, ritual, and"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION\u0002271mantras. Two features, that of the uncommon substances and that of spe-cial pledge articles, are superior ones for developing powers. In all, thereare twelve features.COMPLEMENTARY TANTRIC CONDUCT [(2)]The complementary conduct is to engage in the elaborate,unelaborate,And extremely unelaborate conduct; or the conduct offorsaking duality,Ever-perfect, and victorious in all quarters, and so forth.Tantric conduct that aids in the development of both kinds of powers [thecommon and the supreme] is divided into three types, elaborate, unelaborate,and extremely unelaborate, according to forms of procedures; or into thethree types of conduct [called] forsaking duality, ever-perfect, and victori-ous in all quarters, according to essence.39“And so forth” [in the root verses] refers to other types, distinguished interms of the conduct mode, such as the deliberate behaviors of using de-sire, and training in and enjoying desire,40 and the deliberate behavior ofawareness; and types distinguished in terms of states such as occasionalconduct, conduct of equality, equipoise, conduct subsequent to equipoise,and conduct of states devoid of desire, with desire, and with great desire.It is differentiated according to faculties, stages, and so on; ofthe many types,All are considered part of the three categories of time,procedure, and essence.The branch of tantric application of wrathful practices is of twotypes.Many ways of differentiating tantric conduct have developed, [some] basedon the different faculties of the individual (lower, average, or superior),[others] on the stages of realization (ranging from beginners to persons ofhighly stable realization), and so forth. However, as a condensation, thethree categories of time, procedure, and essence,41 each of which has threeparts, include all those different aspects.For the branch of wrathful tantric application, two practices are taught,one to enhance [realization of ] the phase of generation and one to enhance"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA[realization of ] the phase of completion.

This will be explained extensively in subsequent sections [of the Infi-nite Ocean of Knowledge].A SYNOPSIS OF THE VIEW, MEDITATION, CONDUCT, AND RESULT [dd']In summation, one gains certainty through the view based onwisdomAnd traverses the path through the stages of cultivating thesupreme methods.Realization is enhanced by using experiences in the path andengaging in three conducts.Within this lifetime, the state of union is thereby attained.[Next is] a synopsis of all aspects of the practice of the highest yoga tantrasystem. Initially, by relying on study and reflection, one gains certainty [ofthe path] through the view [based on] wisdom.

Realization is enhancedby using in the path the collections of appearances, sounds, and thoughts asthe creative energy of contemplation and, at the proper time, engaging inthe three kinds of conduct [elaborate, unelaborate, and extremelyunelaborate].

(The three general [action] tantras arethe Secret General Tantra, Dialogue with Subahu Tantra, and Susiddhi.)The third, exemplified by the Yakshini’s Kalpa,3 reveals in great detailonly one ritual or sadhana procedure.The fourth, exemplified by the Manjushri Root Tantra and the SupremeKnowledge of Vajrapani Tantra, comprises texts wherein both rituals and thestages and paths are extensively treated.The fifth, exemplified by the Marichi Dharani, expounds only dharaniand the benefits [of reciting them].Additionally, conduct tantras may be divided into the three families [ofawakened body, speech, and mind]. In that case, the tantra of the family ofawakened body [or tathagata family] is the Vairochanabhisambodhi [Tantra].No tantras of the family of awakened speech [or lotus family] have beentranslated into Tibetan. The tantra of the family of awakened mind [orvajra family] is the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra.Yoga tantras are classified into four types: root tantras, explanatory tantras,subsidiary tantras, and tantras concordant with particular aspects [of theroot tantra]. The first is represented by the Summation of Essential Prin-ciples; the second, by the Indestructible Peak; the third, by the special All-Secret Tantra and Victorious in the Three Worlds Tantra; and the fourth, bythe [Glorious] Supreme Original Being, together known as the “four familiesof yoga.” The inclusion of accessory tantras makes [a total of ] five, which isthe way of identifying yoga tantras that is most well known in Tibet.Highest yoga tantras [are classified into four types: root, subsidiary, ex-planatory, and tantras concordant with particular aspects].The root tantras are of two types, extensive and concise.4 The first isexemplified by the Kalachakra Root Tantra in Twelve Thousand Stanzas andthe Hevajra Tantra Five Hundred Thousand; the second, by the [Kalachakra]Condensed Tantra and [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations.The subsidiary tantras are of two types: continuation tantras, and con-tinuation of the continuation tantras. The first is exemplified by the Con-tinuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra and the Continuation of the Summation"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"TANTRIC SCRIPTURES\u0002275of Essential Principles; the second, by the Continuation of the Continuation[of the Summation of Essential Principles].5The explanatory tantras6 are of five types: clarifications of what is ob-scure [in the root tantra]; supplements to incomplete [topics]; systematiza-tions of scattered [topics]; synopses of material extensively treated [in theroot tantra]; and instructions on methods of teaching [the tantra].To elaborate on these five using the Guhyasamaja [Tantra] as an example,the first type includes texts like the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra,which clarifies obscure and difficult points concerning both the words andmeaning of the root tantra; the Prophetic Declaration of Intention Tantra,which illuminates all of the profound aspects [of the root tantra]; and theDialogue with Four Goddesses Tantra, which clarifies what is obscure con-cerning the essential meaning [of the root tantra].The second, supplements to incomplete topics, includes texts like theIndestructible Garland, which fills in details that are not provided in theroot tantra of Guhyasamaja, such as the number of deities, the details oftwenty rituals [of the mandala], and so on.The third, systematizations of scattered topics, comprises what is set forthin the Indestructible Garland, which organizes and puts in order the rituals,stages, and so forth, that are presented in a dispersed fashion in the roottantra of Guhyasamaja.The fourth, synopses of material treated extensively [in the root tantra],includes summaries of major expositions that detail [every aspect] startingwith each of the letters of the words of the introductory remarks [of theroot tantra]; summaries of major expositions that enumerate the initiationswhich serve to ripen [the recipient]; summaries of major expositions on thecontemplations in the two phases [of generation and completion] that ef-fect liberation; and summaries of major expositions on subjects such as thefive stages, exemplified by the Indestructible Garland. Inherent to this typeare all of the characteristics of the previous types of explanatory tantras.The fifth, instructions on methods of teaching, includes texts like theCompendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra], which revealsthe instructions on the teaching methods of the seven ornaments [to ex-plain the words] of the Guhyasamaja Tantra. It should be understood thatthis system [of five types of explanatory tantras] applies also to the mothertantras.The concordant tantras are of two types: those concordant with bothwords and meaning; and those concordant with the meaning [of the roottantra]."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"276\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAll tantras are included within the two categories of root and subsidiarytantras; or within the two categories of root and explanatory tantras; orwithin the two categories of extensive and concise tantras.As to the extent of those tantric scriptures, the Compendium on the Inde-structible Pristine Awareness [Tantra] states:7The great yoga tantra bears the name“Twelve thousand,” but is beyond reckoningWhen its full extent is considered.The combined tantra is [called] “six thousand”;Conduct tantra, “eight thousand”;And action tantra, “four thousand.”“Great yoga” means the highest yoga tantra not split into method and wis-dom [tantras]. The names, from one called “twelve thousand” down to thatcalled “four thousand,” do not refer to their sizes in terms of number ofstanzas8 since the [action tantra’s] detailed ritual of Amoghapasha has eightthousand stanzas.

To explain [this statement], in initia-tion, the basis of purification is the innate body and mind; the object to bepurified, the adventitious stains; the purificatory means, the four initia-tions with their branches which effect purification, whereupon the pristineawareness beings are made to merge with [and be stabilized within the pledgeones]; and the result of purification, the establishment of the seeds of thefour dimensions of awakening [in the student’s mind].Likewise, in consecration, the basis of purification is an image formed ofmatter; the object to be purified, the stains of the artist [who made thestatue] and of the donor [who commissioned it]; the purificatory means,the correct ritual procedure through which the pristine awareness deitiesmerge with and are stabilized within the pledge ones; and the result ofpurification, the spontaneous activity, as the essence of the indestructibleawakened body, speech, and mind of a buddha, that accomplishes others’welfare.The rationale for this description [of four elements of basis, object, means,and result of purification] is one principally connected to the terminologyof the last cycle of the Buddha’s teaching. Some [scholars], the Sakyapas andothers, take these to be three elements: the object to be purified, purificatorymeans, and result of purification. They assert that the basis of purificationis posited with respect to the object to be purified, and the object, withrespect to the basis, in a relationship of reciprocal dependence, and there-fore the basis of purification is not discussed separately.One should gain an understanding of the numerous elements [withinthe eleven points] such as the ritual implements that are insignia (the vajra,bell, mystic staff, small drum, etc.), and articles (the six [bone] ornaments,etc.);13 mandala procedures such as pitching the lines, applying the colors,and constructing the divine palace; specifications for the ritual feast gather-ings with regard to place [where it is performed], time, and roles of theparticipants; familiarization which serves the dual purpose of the cultiva-tion of powers for the welfare of oneself and the initiation of students forthe welfare of others; and the two categories of the sets of activations, theset related to the body and that related to contemplation."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u000227916.

Therefore, instructions for their exposition [are set forth] begin-ning with the three lower tantra sets.Action tantras should be taught, as is explained in [Buddhaguhya’s] Com-mentary Epitomizing the Dialogue with Subahu Tantra,1 by presenting fourpractices: entrance, approach, effecting powers, and using powers. What-ever is incomplete or obscure in the particular root tantra is to be supple-mented and elucidated by [referring to] general explanatory tantras of actiontantra, such as the Secret General Tantra, which emphasizes entrance;Dhyanottara, which emphasizes approach; Susiddhi, which emphasizes bothapproach and effecting powers; and Dialogue with Subahu Tantra, whichestablishes the characteristics of all four practices.The way conduct tantras should be taught, as explained in [Buddha-guhya’s] Commentary Epitomizing the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra,2involves three approaches to exposition: a statement of the title of thetantra alone (in the case of a student of sharp faculties who gains under-standing from the beginning statement); a statement that scrutinizesthe meaning of the title alone (in the case of a student of average facul-ties who gains understanding through analyses); and thorough analysisof related aspects of the words, with extensive commentary based on asuccessive examination (in the case of a student of low faculties who isengrossed in words).For each of those three approaches, there should be an explanation ofthe two excellences: the excellence of the [tantra’s] promulgator’s objec-tive for himself or herself and the excellence of the promulgator’s objec-tive for others. The first is expounded in terms of the excellence of thecause, nature, and result; the second, in terms of [the excellence of ] themandala, mantra, seals, and so forth. To provide that explanation entailsexpositions on both the conduct related to the mandala rituals and theconduct on the part of the practitioner in order to propitiate the aware-ness mantra [the female deity], the secret mantra [the male deity], and soforth, as well as the resultant [attainments].

These points areincorporated in an abridged form in the exposition of the Vairochan-abhisambodhi [Tantra], and should likewise be applied in expositions ofother conduct tantras as appropriate.Yoga tantra’s styles of exposition are concerned with teaching the excel-lence of the result through the points of introduction [that set forth] theframework of the tantra, and, after that, the means for the attainment ofthe result, the content of which comprises the ten essential principles withtheir twenty (or thirty) subdivisions.3 As to the methods of exposition, theIndestructible Peak 4 states:...forms the compendium of all analysesOf the great means to accomplish all objectives.That which reveals in detail the secretsAnd elucidates the intention of yogaForms the compendium of all analysesThat imparts knowledge of essential principles.The procedure of the vajra yogaAnd the ritual of the yoga of the circleForm the compendium of all analysesThat is known as the supreme secret.Actions that encompass all timesAnd the source of all secret yogasForm the compendium of all analysesThat is the great means for all activities.These four compendiums of analyses were taught as elucidations on theknowledge of all yoga tantras, or methods of exposition, [and are describedas follows:][The first] comprises descriptions of the way the Buddha attainedenlightenment; [the way] the Buddha, for others’ welfare, emanated [themandala of ] the deity and taught [the tantra]; and the definitive mean-ing of the words of the tantra; and expositions in condensed form of the"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"282\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAsubject matter to be taught, all the procedures that accomplish one’sobjectives.The second comprises statements from the root tantra such as:5Having thrust the linga into the bhaga...with explanation:6I shall explain the meaning of bhaga,Which is called bhaga because it conquers.It conquers the body of emotional afflictions.Hence, it is called wisdom bhaga.What, then, is called linga?Linga is explained as “sign.”Wise ones arise from the linga of wisdom,Bodhichitta, the supreme method,Which is known as the sign.Having thrust the linga into the bhagaThe circle’s power is attained.7which constitute expositions that reveal in detail [the meaning of ] secretwords.

However, these seven ornaments are consid-ered not only as methods to expound the Guhyasamaja but also as an im-portant framework for discourses on the [highest] tantras in general. Theseven ornaments [and their twenty-eight subdivisions] are stated in[Chandrakirti’s] Illuminating Lamp:The points of introduction number five;The correct methods are of four types;Parameters for extensive discourses, six types;And modes of exposition number four;The fifth ornament is divided into two;"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"284\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe sixth ornament, divided into five;And the seventh, divided into two:The ornaments are thereby encapsulated.Within the [seven] ornaments, there are five points of introduction con-taining the purpose of the tantra; four correct methods which provide asynopsis of the tantra; six parameters for the words and meanings that formextensive expositions of the tantra; four modes of teaching related to wordsand meanings; two forms [group and individual teachings] distinguished interms of the subject matter; five forms distinguished in terms of the personswho are recipients of the teaching; and two types of the seventh ornamentwhich ascertains the two truths on the basis of scriptures and reasonings,distinguished in terms of the purpose. [In this way,] the ornaments formseven categories, within which are twenty-eight subdivisions. They are re-ferred to as “ornaments” since they delight the wise by beautifying andilluminating the tantras.10THE FIVE POINTS OF INTRODUCTION [1']The first [ornament] comprises five points of introduction, which are tostate the title of the tantra, [the persons] for whom the tantra is intended,the composer, the extent of the tantra, and the purpose.The title of a tantra is given to reflect [one of ] several elements, such asits subject matter, as is the case for the Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, Hevajra,and Kalachakra tantras;11 or the words that convey [the subject matter], asis the case for the Prophetic Declaration of Intention Tantra; or the extent ofthe tantra, as is the case for the [Hevajra] Tantra One Hundred Thousand; orits promulgator, the person who requested it, the examples used, and soforth.If one asks for whose welfare tantra was promulgated, the answer is thattantra was taught primarily to guide persons of sharp faculties who are domi-nated by desire. This is so because the resultant state of great bliss must bereached principally by the path of desire. Nevertheless, tantra is not in-tended solely for the benefit of beings dominated by desire since it teachesthe fierce [mode of ] activation, and so forth, for the sake of persons domi-nated by aversion or other emotional afflictions.If the composer of the tantra is not an ideal one, that tantra will not betrustworthy. Therefore, if one wishes to know who the composer of a par-ticular tantra is, the answer must be found in the section of the particular"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002285tantra where the author is stated. For example, Guhyasamaja was spoken bythe great Vajradhara in the form of a [universal] sovereign; the ChakrasamvaraRoot Tantra, by the [great Vajradhara] in the form of a fearsome heruka.Concerning the extent of a particular tantra, the Guhyasamaja, for in-stance, contains twenty rituals, or eighteen chapters, or five major sections.12The purpose of a tantra is to develop ordinary powers; the most essentialpurpose is to attain the supreme power [of awakening].THE FOUR CORRECT METHODS [2']The second [ornament] comprises the four correct methods, which are [toexpound] the lineage, starting basis, definitive word, and propensity.13 Thesefour [are interpreted] in terms of the way [to become a buddha following apath] free from desire; and in terms of the way [following a path] possessedof desire.First, the four correct methods for [the path] free from desire are asfollows:To have taken birth as a virtuous human being represents what is called“lineage” since it is in a human form alone, by having become a renunciant,that one can becomes free from desire.To become a renunciant in signs, apparel, and so forth, as when [theBuddha as] a prince renounced his entourage of consorts, represents the“starting basis” since to become a renunciant is the only correct [course ofaction] if one aspires to freedom from desire.In addition to having become a renunciant, to safeguard the vows pre-scribed in the discipline collection of teachings represents the “definitiveword” since to do so is correct as an area [of training] definitely required.In addition to safeguarding the vows, to apply the teachings with theaspiration to attain resultant awakening represents the “propensity” sincethis alone is correct for the attainment of freedom from desire. As issaid:Moral, learned, and reflective,One dedicates oneself to meditation.Second, the four correct methods for the path of desire are as follows:To generate oneself as [all] the buddhas of the five buddha families inaccordance with one’s own particular family represents the “lineage” sincethis is correct as the support for mantra practice."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"286\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAMoreover, [the five buddhas], being transformations of Vajradhara [en-dowed with the seven features] of union, and so on, are of a single family,that of the great secret: this represents the “starting basis” since convictionin the mode of the path of desire is thereby imparted.Upon accepting the vows of the five buddha families, to assume theouter, inner, and secret vajra levels [of teaching]14 and so forth, and, inparticular, in highest yoga tantra, to assume the deliberate behavior ofpure conduct in the union of vajra and lotus15 represents the “definitiveword” since this is an area of training that is, without any doubt, defi-nitely required.To engage in the secret teaching that uses in the path the desire arousedby flirtation, laughing, and so forth, represents the “propensity” since thisbrings about the attainment of the dimension of great bliss.THE SIX PARAMETERS [3']The third [ornament] comprises the six parameters [three pairs], which arethe provisional meaning, definitive meaning, interpretable meaning, non-interpretable meaning, standard terminology, and coined terminology. Theyare known as “parameters” since the meaning of the words [of the tantras]do not go beyond these.Expositions using the provisional meaning are intended for persons whodo not actually possess the sublime fortune [to directly fathom the pristineawareness of the phase of completion] in order that the Victor, having con-cealed the real meaning of that teaching, might draw them towards it. Theseconsist in alternative teachings such as those concerning the phase of gen-eration and its subsidiary practices.Expositions using the definitive meaning are of two types. The first, thedefinitive meaning in common with the phase of generation possessed ofauthentic characteristics, comprises such explanations as found in the Com-pendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra],16 which says: “Cam-phor refers to semen.” The second, the definitive meaning of the naturalstate which is perfect in itself, reveals the meaning of the causal continuum,the innate nature, and other aspects of the completion phase.Expositions using the interpretable meaning are intended to reveal es-sential reality to someone [of sharpest faculties] who aspires to the supremegoal while preventing that person from pursuing it without [the guidanceof ] a master. An interpretable teaching is expressed in words that contradictthe ways of the world in that they would be censured by upright persons, as"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002287in the case of the injunction “to slay living creatures.” “To slay living crea-tures” would be interpreted as to block karmic winds. Such words that con-tradict worldly conventions are also intended to attract [to the tantric path]persons [who engage in base acts], such as butchers.Expositions using the non-interpretable meaning teach all the essentialprinciples of the generation-phase practice, such as total emptiness, lumi-nous clarity, and so forth, to persons of low faculties who are not qualifiedto receive the interpretable teachings.Expositions using standard terminology are those in accordance with the[three] lower tantras that concern the performance of detailed rituals relatedto the outer mandala, fire offerings, and so on, and the sets of activations.Expositions using coined terminology are terms such as “kotakhya” [forlife wind]17 that were coined only by the Transcendent One on a particularoccasion and are found neither in treatises nor in [common languages of ]the world.18THE FOUR MODES [4']The fourth [ornament] comprises the four modes, which are [to expound]the literal meaning, general meaning, concealed meaning, and final meaning.The first, the literal meaning, is an explanation that is simply focused onthe syllables [of the words] by means of splitting them [into parts], and soforth.19Expositions using general meaning are of two types: one, the generalmeaning of the sutras and tantras; and two, the general meaning of thephase of generation. The first type comprises the general meaning that coun-teracts regret felt by persons who have entered the sutra way; and the gen-eral meaning that counteracts regret felt by those who have entered themantra way. The first is used in the case of a person who is aware of suchstatements as the following:Despite endless austerities and vows,One’s goal will still be not realized,But attainment is swiftly gainedBy enjoying all sensual pleasures.and feels regret over not having embarked on, from the beginning, [practiceof ] the teachings for which the path is easily accessible and through whichenlightenment is attained in the same lifetime, and thinks that it was not"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"288\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAgood to have entered the sutra way (or the way of action or conduct tantras,and so on). In response, an explanation such as this is given: It is not thecase that a person who wishes to be free from cyclic existence, attain awak-ening, and so on, should enter the highest yoga tantra and not the path ofsutra. As it is said: For those endowed with purity and method, Emotional afflictions contribute to awakening.Even the sutras say enlightenment can be attained through an easily ac-cessible path if one is a person of sharp faculties and possessed of specialmethod and wisdom. Such an exposition is referred to as the general mean-ing [type].The general meaning exposition that counteracts regret felt by a per-son who has entered the mantra path is used in the case of someone [whohas entered the highest yoga tantra] and feels regret at having done so,thinking that, in the sutras and the action and conduct tantras, and soforth, the Teacher spoke of ablutions, cleanliness, fasting, and so on, andthat [the highest yoga tantra] rejects these and instead expounds behaviorlike that of dogs and pigs, for which excrement, urine, male and femaleregenerative fluids, and so on, are offered to the deities and also ingestedby oneself.A general meaning exposition for a person of low faculties [who feelssuch regret] comprises statements such as this: This system [of highest yogatantra] rejects the performance of ablutions, cleanliness, and other [obser-vances] when, as in the case of those performed by brahminical Hindus,they are devoid of special method and wisdom. However, it does teach formsof cleansing that purify [the karmic traces of ] negative actions andobscurations, and so on; and therefore to ingest excrement or urine and doother similar acts is to apply the practice of total sameness of flavor of thesense faculties and their objects.A general meaning exposition for a person of sharp faculties [who feelssuch regret] comprises statements such as this: There is also [a way to] real-ization devoid of hardships and austerities which is taught in action tantrassuch as the Trisamayavyuha. To be attached to cleanliness, adverse to what isunclean, and so forth, are meaningless [conceptions] and do not favor theattainment of the pristine awareness of total sameness. Hence, to overcomesuch adherences, even the sutras, action tantra, and so forth, prescribe theconduct of sameness of flavor."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002289Second, a general meaning [exposition] of the phase of generation in-cludes teachings on the outer aspects and general meaning of the genera-tion phase, such as the following:20Always contemplate at the tip of the noseA precious [insignia] of five different colors.which are instructions for persons unqualified to hear the concealed teach-ings on sexual desire to imagine the subtle insignia of the five buddha fami-lies on the relative “tip of the nose.”Expositions using the concealed meaning consist of teachings that ex-plicitly present practices involving sexual desire in the union of the yoginand yogini. They are referred to as the concealed teachings on sexual de-sire, concealed because to speak of them in a group would cause embar-rassment. The stage of practice of the illusory body, the supreme essenceveiled by subtle but manifest stains, is the concealed [teaching] on therealization of relative truth. The cause for that [attainment of the illusorybody] is the pristine awareness of light, increase, and culmination, themiddling essence veiled by middling stains; and the cause for that, thespeech isolation termed “indestructible awakened speech” and body isola-tion termed “indestructible awakened body,” the minor essence, or naturalstate, [veiled] by great stains.21 Because these are concealed, their explana-tions are also concealed.Expositions using the final meaning consist of teachings on the stage ofluminous clarity, the final path; and teachings on the stage of union, thefinal result.Each of these four modes represent the same vajra class [of tantric teach-ings] but expound the teachings in accordance with the different faculties[of the recipient]. Here, [the four] modes have been presented generally inrelation to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, but should be applied in a similar wayto other tantras. Therefore, a general statement on each follows:The literal meaning appraises the meaning of the syllables [of the words]according to grammar and spelling; the general meaning expounds what isin common with the sutra way and lower tantras; the concealed meaning,the uncommon profound points of highest yoga tantra; and the final mean-ing, the way to realization of the state of union with training and beyondtraining based on the first three.This discussion on the four modes and six parameters is based on dis-tinctions in the levels of [the students’] minds (to be explained below) but"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"290\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAhas been set forth here according to the tradition of the Guhyasamaja Tantrain order to be easily understood.TWO FORMS [GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL TEACHINGS] [5']The fifth [ornament] comprises two forms of exposition, group teachingsand teachings to individual students. The standard terminology, non-inter-pretable meaning, provisional meaning, literal meaning, and general mean-ing are taught to students in a group. (It is not permissible to teach tantra tosomeone who is not one’s student.) Teachings on the phase of completionusing coined terminology and the definitive meaning, and expositions us-ing the interpretable meaning, concealed meaning, and final meaning aregiven only to the best students, who are like “jewels.”That being the case, with the exception of the concealed sexual practices,teachings on the generation phase and related topics are expounded to agroup; and those on the completion phase and related topics, to individualstudents. Thus, the form of teaching depends on which of the two phases isbeing taught.TEACHINGS FOR FIVE [TYPES OF] RECIPIENTS [6']The sixth [ornament] comprises expositions for recipients of five types: likea blue lotus, white lotus, [red] lotus, sandalwood tree, and jewel.A blue lotus absorbs nutrients from various sources in the environmentand retains its nectar as long as it is in water. However, it withers quickly,losing its luster, fragrance, and so on, when plucked. Similarly, a persondeemed “blue lotus” listens to all of the master’s teachings and is able toretain [this knowledge] for a time. However, when there are worldly dis-tractions and other activities, he or she will instantly forget it.A white lotus is similar to a blue one, but does not wither as easily and ismore beautiful in color. However, although it keeps its nectar, it is not ableto emit [its fragrance], and, like a water-sogged ball of cotton in a vase, it isdifficult to pluck. Similarly, a person deemed “white lotus” acquires muchknowledge and does not forget it, but owing to having little self-confidenceis unable to transmit this knowledge to others.A [red] lotus whose radiance is finer than others’ emits a sweet fragrancewhen opened by the sun and is filled with nectar. However, the nectar isquickly released and therefore does not last long. Similarly, a person deemed“lotus,” endowed with faith, compassion, and wisdom, has a fully blos-"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002291somed mind and is able to transmit knowledge to others. However, becausehe or she is of an unstable nature, these qualities do not last for long.A sandalwood tree [of inferior kind]22 does not absorb nutrients fromthe various sources in the environment and lacks flexibility. Its roots do notspread deep into the ground, and around its many branches coil venomoussnakes. Thus, it cannot afford protection for others. Similarly, a persondeemed “sandalwood tree” has absorbed little knowledge yet takes pride inhis social status, and so forth. Although lacking [knowledge] rooted in scrip-tures and reasonings, he or she talks a great deal and is therefore unable tonurture students.A jewel devoid of faults and endowed with many fine qualities has anexcellent and unchanging nature and provides the source for whatever isneeded or desired. Similarly, a person deemed “jewel” maintains pure eth-ics, is learned in many sutras and tantras, perseveres in what is whole-some, exhibits great wisdom, and is of pure mind. Accompanied by thesequalities, he or she acquires knowledge and then effectively teaches others.The jewel is the best type of student; the other three, middling; and thesandalwood tree type, inferior. The sandalwood tree type has the good for-tune to be connected to the [secret] mantra and is therefore mentioned here[among the five] for its excellent affinity [for tantra].The first four types of individuals have the fortune to receive group teach-ings and the phase of completion [teachings]. The jewel-like ones are quali-fied to receive the individual teachings. This implies that the previous fourpossess the fortune [to be taught] the phase of generation.EXPOSITIONS ON THE TWO TRUTHS [7']The seventh [ornament] comprises expositions on the two truths. The as-certainment of the two truths or two phases by means of scriptures andreasonings, and the elimination of doubts, and so forth, is the purpose ofexpounding tantra using the [previous] six ornaments. Based on that, tomake the phase of completion the essence is the supreme purpose. Hence,all of the highest yoga tantras are to be expounded by means of the sevenornaments.SPECIAL METHODS IN THE YOGINI TANTRAS [bb]...The special exposition methods for ChakrasamvaraAre six key instructions and three unions;"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"292\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAFor Hevajra, those of the three purities;For Mahamaya, the shape, mantra, and reality;For Chatuhpita, the four seats; Samputa, seven secrets;For others, the four dwellings and four essential principles;For Kalachakra, the outer, inner, and alternative levels,All of those based on the four reliances.Special styles for teaching the tantras are set forth in the yogini tantras ofhighest yoga tantra. The methods to expound Chakrasamvara are stated inthe Equal to the Sky Tantra, which is part of the Chakrasamvara Rali tantras:23The meaning of words, auxiliary meaning,Condensed meaning, general meaning,Concealed meaning, and the final meaning:The tantras are definitely these alone.Accordingly, the Chakrasamvara Tantra is expounded in terms of these sixinstructions. The general, concealed, and final meanings are the three in-structions concerned with the subject matter, or the meaning to be con-veyed; and the literal meaning, auxiliary meaning, and inclusive meaningare the three instructions for ways to explain the terms that convey thesubject matter.24 Those are to be applied individually to the meanings andthe words of the scripture, as well as collectively to each word of the scrip-ture, as appropriate for the particular exposition.Some masters speak of four meanings:Outer, secret, inner, and absolute:These are four kinds of meaningsWhich represent the mandala, action seal,Body, and absence of intrinsic nature.It should be understood that these correspond to the six instructions justmentioned.In the esoteric instructions of the great sage Naropa, it is stated that theChakrasamvara Root Tantra is to be expounded by means of the three unionswhile the Chakrasamvara Concise Tantra says that it is to be expounded bymeans of what are known as the secrecy of the path, the secrecy of theresult, and the branches that bring these to completion.The Hevajra Tantra should be expounded in terms of the three purities,as stated in the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations:25"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002293In a definitive way, the purity of all thingsIs declared to be the true nature as it is.Later, it should be described as the purity of the deitiesIn terms of their individual distinctions.The essential nature of self-awareness is purity itself:There is no liberation through another purity.26The three purities may be expounded by applying them to the threecontinuums. In terms of the causal continuum, the true nature of all phe-nomena, or primordial peace [emptiness], is the purity of the true nature;manifestation in the form of a body with face and arms is the purity of theindividual deities; and the experience of bliss, not experienced by any othermeans, the purity of self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its ownnature].In terms of the continuum of method, the view that has eliminated mis-conceptions on the basis of study and reflection is the purity of the truenature; the generation phase of the path, the purity of the individual dei-ties; and the phase of completion, the purity of self-awareness.In terms of the resultant continuum, the essential dimension of awaken-ing is the purity of the true nature; the two form dimensions of awakening,the purity of the individual deities; and the innate dimension of awakening,the purity of self-awareness. In addition, the three continuums may be ex-pounded by applying each to the three purities.The Mahamaya Tantra should be expounded by means of [the three es-sential natures,] shape, mantra, and reality. The same tantra states:27Unstained by the faults of existence,The meaning of tantra should be understoodThrough the three types of unions:The natures of shape, mantra, and reality.The essential nature of shape denotes the phase of generation, which, afterthe vase initiation has been conferred on the body, reveals the body itself asthe manifest dimension of awakening. The essential nature of mantra de-notes the inner heat, which, after the secret initiation has been conferred onthe speech, reveals speech itself as the enjoyment dimension of awakening.The essential nature of reality denotes the third initiation, which, after thewisdom initiation has been conferred on the mind, reveals the mind itself as"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"294\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe reality dimension of awakening. The essential nature of the ultimatereality, after the fourth initiation has been conferred on the body, speech,and mind, together with the winds, reveals the winds themselves as theessential dimension of awakening. Both the reality of the initiation and theultimate reality are included within “reality,” thus making the three essen-tial natures.The Chatuhpita Tantra should be expounded by means of the “four seats,”the seat of oneself, the seat of others, the seat of union, and the seat of thesecret, as a framework for the tantra in general from beginning to end, aswell as for each of its chapters.The four seats may be applied to the three continuums. In terms of thecausal continuum, the seat of oneself refers to the revelation that every-thing, the outer environment and inner inhabitants, is a manifestation ofone’s mind; the seat of others, the revelation [of appearances] as empty ofouter objects and perceiver; the seat of the union, the nonduality of appear-ances and emptiness; and the seat of the secret, the essence of this union asthe nature of great bliss.The four empties—great empty, empty, very empty, and total empty(the reality dimension of awakening)—which are experienced at the mo-ment of death of [every] being, are present as the four seats of oneself,others, union, and secret, respectively. [Likewise,] the transference of con-sciousness, the mental body, unobstructedness, and conception (the en-joyment dimension of awakening) [related to] the intermediate state arepresent as the four seats, respectively. The four components, the white[semen], the red [ovum], consciousness, and the formed body (the mani-fest dimension of awakening) [related to] birth are present as the four seats,respectively.In terms of the path continuum, the seat of oneself refers to a qualifiedmaster who confers the ripening initiation; the seat of others, a qualifiedstudent; the seat of union, conferral of initiation; and the seat of the se-cret, the meaning of the initiation that has been experienced in the[student’s] mind. The four seats must be applied as well to each of thefour initiations.In terms of liberative means, the seat of others refers to the outer practiceof the phase of generation; the seat of oneself, the inner practice of one’sbody as method; the seat of the union, the secret practice with a real con-sort; and the seat of the secret, the essential reality of the inconceivablepristine awareness of the great seal. The four seats should be applied as wellto each of these four [outer, inner, secret, and essential reality]."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002295In terms of the resultant continuum, the seat of oneself refers to thereality dimension of awakening, the fulfillment of one’s own objective; theseat of others, the manifest dimension of awakening, to guide one’s students;the seat of union, the enjoyment dimension of awakening, endowed with fivecertainties;28 and the seat of the secret, the indivisibility [of the previous di-mensions] as the essence of great bliss. The Chatuhpita Tantra is thus ex-pounded by applying the natures of the [four] seats [to the three continuums].The Continuation of the Samputa Tantra is to be expounded by means ofthe seven secrets, such as the obscure. These are summarized as follows:one, the obscure, the causal continuum, the meaning to be understood;two, the concise formulation of essential reality, the eleven [vase] initia-tions; three, the five seed syllables,29 the phase of generation; four, the con-cealed sacred element, the view that realizes the meaning of essential reality;five, the secret lotus, the path connected to the third initiation, the meansof the mandala circle;30 six, the joy at the navel, the phase of self-blessing;31and seven, that which serves all [purposes], the different branches of thepath such as pledges and vows.It is explained that some tantras are to be expounded by means of the“four dwellings”: dwelling in a sphere, in water, and so on. The Equal to theSky Tantra 32 states:In a sphere, in water, in form,And in a state beyond form:These are the four dwellings.The tantras are definitely these alone.These four dwellings should be understood in relation to the threecontinuums.The four dwellings of the causal continuum are explained as follows: Inthe case of a sentient being who will be born from a womb, first, when theparents are enjoying the pleasure of sexual intercourse, the intermediatestate is also attracted to that pleasure and as a consequence, enters the womb.This is the “dwelling in a sphere”: the enjoyment dimension of awakeningwhich experiences bliss. The stages of fetal development, such as the mermer stage,33 which occur after the consciousness has become unconscious inthe midst of the semen and ovum [of the parents], is the “dwelling in wa-ter.” The stage in which the being is embodied, with all the sense facultiescomplete, is the “dwelling in form.” The stage when the being has died isthe “dwelling in a state beyond form.”"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"296\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAs to the four dwellings in terms of the continuum of method, the fourof the initiation [are explained in this way]: The articles used in the vaseinitiation, the diadem, and so forth, primarily represent the “dwelling in asphere”; the substance used in the secret initiation, bodhichitta, the “dwell-ing in water”; the referent used in the wisdom initiation, the male andfemale deities in union, the “dwelling in form”; and the referent for thefourth initiation, great bliss transcending thought, the “dwelling in the statebeyond form.”The four dwellings are also applied to each initiation individually. Inthe context of the water initiation, the transformation of the syllable huminto a vajra is the “dwelling in a sphere”; the melting of the vajra, the“dwelling in water”; from that, the generation of the deity with face andarms, the “dwelling in form”; and the blessing of one’s continuum, whichoccurs as the deity is absorbed [into oneself ], the “dwelling in the statebeyond form.” The four dwellings are likewise applied to all the other ini-tiations.As to the four dwellings in terms of the path, there are four dwellings inthe context of the phase of generation and four in the context of the phaseof completion. For the first, the deity’s insignia which arises from the seedsyllable is the “dwelling in a sphere”; the melting of the causal Vajradharawhich arises from the deity’s insignia, the “dwelling in water”; the manifes-tation of the resultant Vajradhara which arises from the causal one,34 the“dwelling in form”; and, at the conclusion [of the session of practice], thedissolution [of the deity] into fundamental luminous clarity, the “dwellingin the state beyond form.” The second, the four dwellings in the context ofthe phase of completion, are to be known through an understanding of thethree higher initiations.As to the four dwellings in terms of the resultant continuum, the enjoy-ment dimension of awakening is the “dwelling in a sphere” since this is theexperience of bliss; the reality dimension of awakening, the “dwelling inwater” since it is of one flavor [with everything], like pouring water intowater, or devoid of the “corners” of discursive thought, like a drop of water;the manifest dimension of awakening, the “dwelling in form” since it hasa form with face and arms; and the essential dimension of awakening,the “dwelling in the state beyond form,” since all dimensions are thereinintegrated.There are many other methods of exposition, such as that of the [HevajraTantra] Two Examinations, which teaches all tantras by including them withinthe two phases [generation and completion], or that of the Worldly Lord of"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002297the Family Tantra, which expounds the tantras in terms of the four essentialprinciples.35The exposition style of Kalachakra, the king of all tantras, is stated inPundarika’s Great Commentary [Stainless Light]:36On the basis of the mundane and supramundane truths,37 a com-plete elucidation is made of the total purity through the fouraspects of perfect awakening or four vajras,38 the four dimen-sions of awakening,39 the six families,40 the twelve truths,41 thesixteen essential realities,42 the sixteen emptinesses and the six-teen compassions whose essential natures constitute the subjectmatter and the means of conveying the subject matter,43 the tenmundane initiations, and the eleventh, the supramundane one.44A complete elucidation is made of the action seal, pristine aware-ness seal, and the great seal, as well as the mundane andsupramundane powers.45 [These elucidations] are of the essentialnatures of the five chapters, or five analyses [of the KalachakraTantra]: the [outer] world system, the inner [vajra body], theactual conferral of initiation, the sadhana practice, and pristineawareness.46Accordingly, the teachings of Kalachakra, such as the two phases [of genera-tion and completion] which are based on the two truths, the four awaken-ings, and so forth, are expounded in relation to the outer, inner, andalternative levels. As is said:As for the outer, likewise the inner;As for the inner, likewise the alternative.To explain, with the exception of standard terminologies, every word isexpounded extensively in terms of the three levels (outer, inner, and alterna-tive), or concisely in terms of the two meanings (provisional and defini-tive), as is done in the Commentaries by Bodhisattvas.47In short, to expound a particular tantra, one must be knowledgeable ofthe content of many tantras and possess the elements of the teaching meth-ods of individual tantras and the instructions of masters. In a way appropri-ate to the intellect of the student, one must introduce the pith meaning andteach the tantra based on the four reliances.48 The detailed explanation [ofhow to teach tantra] is to be learned from a master’s instructions in the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"298\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAcontext of the expositions of individual tantras. Accordingly, Vajragarbha’sCommentary [Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra] states:49Understanding of Chakrasamvara and Chatuhpita should be derivedfrom the Hevajra Tantra;Understanding of Hevajra and the Concise Chakrasamvara, fromChatuhpita;And understanding of their definitive meanings, from the SupremePrimordial Buddha (Kalachakra) and the Great Chakrasamvara.Those who aspire to the path should always understandAll tantras such as those just mentionedThrough brief and extensive presentations of other tantrasAs well as through their commentaries.50THE SPECIAL EXPOSITION METHOD IN THE ESOTERICINSTRUCTIONS SYSTEM [iii]In the esoteric instructions system, tantras are taught in termsof the three continuums.A protective circle, food offering, offering to the teacher, andmeditation modelled on early events are performed.The eleven faults of the three doors are eliminated bystudents.Those who expound and listen to the tantras undistractedly andendowed with the ornament of speechWill be especially watched over by all awareness-holders, it istaught.At the present time, the system widely known for the expositions of theChakrasamvara, Hevajra, and other tantras, and which represents, in par-ticular, the meaning of the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, is thatof holders of the esoteric instructions of Naropa and his followers, wherebyall tantras are expounded in terms of the three continuums.Expositions in terms of the causal continuum include teachings on theway in which the intrinsically pure nature, or state of perfect peace, exists inall sentient beings; and descriptions of [the vajra body] (possessor of thisnature) with a detailed breakdown into thirty-six constituents (aggregates,"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002299elements, and sense fields); or, concisely stated, teachings on the way inwhich body, speech, and mind exist.Expositions in terms of the method continuum include teachings on thepath that effects ripening [of the student], that of the initiation, and thepath that effects liberation, the way of cultivating the two phases [of gen-eration and completion] and their branches.Expositions in terms of the resultant continuum include teachings onthe actualization of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses,beginning with the conferral of initiation to ripen that which abides as thecause, followed by the cultivation of the two phases which develop contem-plation [in the state] of realization and thereby the stage of attainment.Persons who listen to [teachings on] tantras [expounded] in the ways setforth [above] must first have received initiation in the appropriate mannerand have assumed the vows. When an exposition is being given, a protec-tive circle51 is first imagined, and an offering of food to the sky-farers andother [beings] is made. The environment and inhabitants are viewed as themandala [of the deity], and an offering such as gold is made to the teacher.Modelled on early events of [Buddha’s] teaching [of tantra], the master isimagined as the lord of the mandala, and the student, as the requester of thetantra, and so forth, by means of contemplation carried out by both stu-dent and teacher.Students must eliminate the faults of body, speech, and mind, or elevenfailings: physical unfitness (sleepiness, and so on), playing, joking, angryconfrontation, babble, involvement in evaluations and deductions due tostrong inclination towards sophism, lacking esoteric instructions, havingfalse instructions, or having received them from an unripened [uninitiated]individual, harboring a competitive attitude, and a desire for material gain.Those who expound and listen to the tantras in the ways described, withundistracted minds and endowed with the ornaments of speech, reap mea-sureless benefits, both temporary and lasting.

However, certain masters consider what is"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"THE WAYS OF THE ANCIENT TRADITION\u0002303referred to as the “awareness-holders’ collection of teachings” as a separatecollection: the [Indian] master Aryadeva, the Tibetan scholar Rok DershekChenpo, the omniscient Drimé Özer (Longchenpa), and the Lord of DharmaTerdak Lingpa5 all maintain that, in general, this constitutes a fourth [col-lection of teachings]. The Majestic Creative Energy of the Universe states:6The 21,000 teachings of the discipline collectionWere delivered in order to overcome desire.The 21,000 teachings of the discourses collectionWere delivered in order to overcome aversion.The 21,000 teachings of the phenomenology collectionWere delivered in order to overcome delusion.The 21,000 teachings of the fourth collectionWere delivered in order to overcome all of these.In short, although 84,000 teachings were delivered,All were intended to overcome afflictive emotions.Moreover, the Array of Qualities Tantra states:7The three outer collections of teachingsWere taught as the particular remediesFor desire, aversion, and delusion, respectively.The secret mantra, which equals the unsurpassable,Was taught as the remedy for all afflictions.According to what is said in the general scriptures of the Buddha’s words,the ways are not considered to be limited to one specific number. This is sobecause the Buddha’s compassion reveals whatever is appropriate for thoseto be guided, in accordance with their levels of intelligence. The [Transcen-dent Wisdom] Extensive [Scripture] states:The unsurpassable and inconceivable ways that have been taughtAre none other than what manifests to the individual’s mind.The Descent to Lanka [Discourse] states:8In order to guide all sentient beingsI have explained many different ways.It is not a case of “this is the way.”"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"304\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe different stages may also be considered collectively. For example, theWhite Lotus of the Sacred Doctrine states:There is one way, not three ways.This kind of statement [of the Buddha] is referring to the result [of theway]; from that perspective, ultimately, there is only one way. Nevertheless,two ways are differentiated, that of the lesser way and the greater way; or,alternatively, the causal way [sutra] and resultant way [tantra]. There arethree ways [when differentiated into] the ways of the proclaimers, solitarysages, and bodhisattvas; or, alternatively, the way [of sutra] that leads awayfrom the source of suffering; the way [of outer tantra] [that resembles] Vedicausterity; and the way [of inner tantra] of the dominating method.9 Thereare four [when differentiated into] the three causal ways10 and the resultantway. Moreover, Descent to Lanka states:11As long as mind continues,There is no end to spiritual ways.When the mind has been transformedThere is neither a traveller nor a way.12This passage points out that as long as there are various levels of conceptualmind, the ways [to realization] will be without end and are therefore incon-ceivable. It goes so far as to say that a so-called “way” with paths to travel,traveller of those paths, and so on, does not exist except as meanings attrib-uted by the conceptual mind.Nonetheless, the General Scripture [that Unifies the Knowledge of All Bud-dhas] states:13Moreover, Lord of Lanka,The definitive and ultimate wayIs taught in three precise divisions:The way that leads one from the source of suffering,[That resembles] Vedic austerity, and that of the dominating method.Each of these three is subdivided into three sets: the three sets of the wayof characteristics [of the proclaimer, solitary sage, and bodhisattva];14 thethree sets of outer tantras [action, ubhaya or conduct,15 and yoga]; andthe three sets of inner tantras [mahayoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga].

Even the pairs of the six refined essences (of the five elements, plusmind) are essentially identical [in the ground]. Thus, the ground primordi-ally abides as the nature of the three indestructible vajras, which represent theextremely subtle three doors [of body, speech, and mind], utterly immutable.The ground being designated as a “way” is [a case of ] referring to a basis[i.e, the ground] with the name of that which relies on that basis [i.e., theway]. [Buddhaguhya’s] Sequence of the Path states:The way of the ground is presented first.Although the way of gods and humans is said to be the ground or preconditionfor all ways, in this context, the ground is considered to be as just stated above.The supreme way of the path (which presents the explanation) includeseverything from the way of the proclaimers up to anuyoga. These ways arecorrelated with the days of the lunar calendar, from the third to the four-teenth [of the waxing moon], respectively.The way of the result is the supreme pristine awareness of natural lumi-nous clarity which transcends explanation and thought, cause and effect,commitment and effort. This is the final result to which all other ways lead:atiyoga itself.THE INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS OF THE NINE WAYS [c]This section has two parts: a statement of the names for the first six ways;and an extensive discussion of the three yogas [mahayoga, anuyoga, andatiyoga]."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"THE WAYS OF THE ANCIENT TRADITION\u0002307THE NAMES OF THE FIRST SIX WAYS [i]The ways of proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvasconstitute the way of liberation from the source of suffering;And kriya, ubhaya, and yoga, the way resembling Vedicausterity. These are essentially identicalTo the ways described in the common explanation, from whichknowledge of these should be gained.The first [three] of the nine grades of ways are the three sets of teachingswith specific characteristics [the way of characteristics]: the way ofproclaimers, that of solitary sages, and that of bodhisattvas. These guideone toward liberation by means of relinquishing karmic actions and emo-tional afflictions which are the source or cause [of suffering], and are there-fore known as the way of liberation from the source of suffering.[The second three of the nine are] the three sets that constitute the outertantras: kriya (action), ubhaya (conduct) or “tantra of both,” and yoga (union)tantra. In these yogas, the practitioner must engage in ritual practices suchas ablution and strict cleanliness resembling the customs of Brahmin pro-ponents of the Vedas. Hence, these three tantras are known as the way [re-sembling] Vedic austerity.The presentation of those six is essentially identical to the way explainedabove in the context of the new schools of mantra. Thus, one should gainknowledge of them from the common explanation given above.THE THREE YOGAS [MAHAYOGA, ANUYOGA, AND ATIYOGA] [ii]This has two parts: an overview; and an extensive discussion.OVERVIEW [aa]The tantra, elucidation, and esoteric instructions systemsconstitute the way of the dominating method.These are known as the three sets of generation, completion,and great perfection.The three [inner] yogas are the tantra [system of ] mahayoga, the elucida-tion [system] of anuyoga, and the esoteric instructions [system of ] atiyoga.22These yogas conclusively establish the knowledge that everything animate"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"308\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAand inanimate, the form manifestation of the dimensions of awakening andpristine awarenesses, mind nature, is the indivisibility of the two superiortruths,23 beyond any [specific] way of conduct. The yogas are therefore theskillful methods whereby all phenomena are “dominated” within the stateof total sameness and so are spoken of by the general designation of the“way of the dominating method.” These three yogas are also known as thethree sets, generation, completion, and the great perfection, respectively.As to the special features of those three, Lhajé Zurchungpa24 distinguishesthem based on their views. Mahayoga is distinctive in its understandingthat all phenomena are the magical display of the indivisibility of appear-ance and emptiness, mind’s nature. Anuyoga is distinctive in its under-standing that all phenomena are the creative energy of the nonduality of theultimate dimension [of phenomena] and pristine awareness, mind’s nature.Atiyoga is distinctive in its understanding that all phenomena are the verymanifestation of primordial, naturally present, pristine awareness, which iswithout origin or cessation, mind’s nature. Longchenpa’s [Great Chariot] states:Mahayoga, the father tantra, the nature of method [related to] ap-pearance, [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional af-fliction is aversion and who are subject to excessive discursiveness.Anuyoga, the mother tantra, the wisdom of the completion phase[related to] the essential reality of emptiness, [is taught] to benefitthose whose strongest emotional affliction is desire and who de-light in stillness of mind.Atiyoga, the nature of nonduality, [is taught] to benefit thosewhose strongest emotional affliction is delusion and who are tar-nished by [attachment to] effort.25 The Great Array states:26The generation phase is for minds elevated [with manyconcepts];The completion phase, for minds with attachment [to theexperience of bliss];And the great perfection, for the most secret and supreme.Thus, the yogas are described in those terms.

Generally, seven mandalas are explained, as stated inthe Magical Manifestation:"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"MAHAYOGA\u0002313In this context, mandala comprises the mandala of the nature,The mandala of reflected images, the superior mandala of reflectedimages,The contemplation mandala, the superior contemplation mandala,The bodhichitta mandala, and the supreme assembly mandala.The first of these, the mandala of the nature, is divided into the mandala ofthe nature and the spontaneously perfect mandala of the nature. Thus, thereare the eight mandalas, explained as follows:First, the fundamental nature of all cyclic existence and perfect peace,the ultimate dimension of reality which is not in the least subject to con-ceptual formulations, is called the mandala of the nature.Second, the nature of pristine awareness endowed with two purities,2being spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of the sevenfold riches3and thereby effecting the welfare of sentient beings, is called the spontane-ously perfect mandala of the nature.Third, the four continents and Mount Meru existing as the reflection ofthe five pristine awarenesses is called the mandala of reflected images.Fourth, [the four continents and Mount Meru] depicted in colored pow-ders, on painted cloth, or in three-dimensional construction is called thesuperior mandala of reflected images. Being constructed by human effort,it is referred to as “superior.”Fifth, the yogin’s contemplation that is devoid of conceptual constructsis called the mandala of contemplation.Sixth, the yogin’s meditation on the mandala circle in the phase of gen-eration is called the mandala of superior contemplation. Being imagina-tively created, it is referred to as the “superior contemplation mandala.”Seventh, the bodhichitta, or kunda [semen], is called the mandala ofbodhichitta.Eighth, a gathering of any number of yogins and yoginis engaged inpractice is called the mandala of the assembly.Specifically, the actual mandalas used to confer initiation are the fourmandalas that correspond to the particular level [of recipient], and the [four]mandalas [of the four initiations] suited to effect the ripening of the major-ity of individuals in present times [the mandalas of colored powders, thebhaga, and relative and ultimate bodhichitta]. The former four are themandala of the nature of pristine awareness; the superior reflected images ofcontemplation mandala, also called the emanated mandala; the mandala ofthe experience of total presence;4 and the superior reflected images mandala.5"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"314\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe first three of these are explained in the Vajra of Magical Manifesta-tion6 as mandalas used in cases of conferral of a particular initiation by amaster who is a perfect buddha, one who dwells on the final path,7 and onewho dwells on the path of meditation or path of seeing, respectively. Thestudents receiving the initiation would be, respectively, bodhisattvas on thefinal stage of awakening; those who have developed to perfection the quali-ties associated with the paths of seeing and meditation; and the paths ofaccumulation and preparation. Hence, these mandalas are the spheres ofexperience of exalted individuals.The fourth is conferral of initiation into the superior reflected imagesmandala, performed by a qualified master who has gained at least a simili-tude of stability in contemplation, and conferred on students of good for-tune. Depending on the type of student, there is an appropriate conferralfor which a mandala of colored powders is used to initiate a student of lesserfortune; one painted on cloth, to initiate one of middling fortune; and amandala that is no more than a tiny referent, such as a small heap [of pre-cious stones or flowers or the deity’s symbol], to initiate one of supremefortune. Accordingly, the Gathering of the Joyful Ones of the Eight Transmit-ted Precepts Root Initiation Ritual says:As to conferral of initiation in a particular mandala,Those said to be the best, average, or least adeptAre given initiation in the three mandalas, respectively,Of flowers, the painted, and the colored powders.The mandalas used to confer the profound initiations are the same as thosefor the three high initiations as explained above [in the section on mandalain the new tradition].8In accordance with the Net of Magical Manifestation, the actual initia-tions are as stated in the [Secret] Essence:9Knowing that he is endowed with faith and energy, and [capableof ] deliberate behavior,Confer on him the initiations that bring benefit, and after thatConfer in sequence the initiations that impart ability.Accordingly, the ten outer initiations that bring benefit (diadem, head or-nament, [the chaplet, armor, victory banner, seals, parasol, vase, food anddrink, and five essences]) are conferred to ripen persons who have faith.10"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"MAHAYOGA\u0002315The five initiations that impart ability are conferred to ripen personswho have energy. The initiation [of Ratnasambhava] concerning listeningand the initiation [of Akshobhya] concerning meditation impart the abilityto accomplish one’s own welfare. The initiation [of Amitabha] concerningteaching and the initiation [of Amoghasiddhi] concerning awakened activ-ity impart the ability to accomplish others’ welfare. The initiation [of thefive buddha families] concerning the infinite teachings of the vajra kingimparts the ability to accomplish both the welfare of oneself and that ofothers.11The three initiations of profundity are conferred to ripen persons ofthree [types]: those [capable of ] the deliberate behavior of tantric conduct,the deliberate behavior of awareness, and the deliberate behavior ofsameness.12According to the general transmitted teachings [such as] Gathering of theJoyful Ones, there are four initiations in the sadhana tradition. The Com-mentary on the Pure Scripture states:13The outer, inner, and secret initiations, and the initiationThat generally encompasses all the ways and their views:Confer these initiations in sequence and in their entirety.Thus, the four are the outer, inner, and secret initiations, and the initiationof essential reality. The outer initiation is conferred so that students who aredominated by aversion may use [the practice of ] releasing [beings]14 as thepath. Conferral of this initiation is by means of one hundred and eightouter and inner ritual objects, such as the vase.The inner initiation is conferred so that those students who are domi-nated by pride may use the deity as the path. Conferral of this initiation isby means of the physical body.The secret initiation is conferred so that those students who are domi-nated by desire may use sexual union as the path. Conferral is by means ofthe aid of a consort.The initiation of essential reality is conferred so that those students whoare dominated by delusion may use discursive thought as the path. Confer-ral is by means of the mind.In the special transmitted teachings of the sadhana practices such as thatof Vajrakila, four initiations are conferred as in the general transmitted teach-ings common to the highest yoga tantra. Moreover, although within theespecially profound tradition of accomplished masters there are many con-"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"316\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAferrals of initiation, in terms of general categories, all initiations of the high-est [tantra] are contained within the four initiations just mentioned.ENTRANCE BY APPLICATION [ii']One enters by way of three contemplations: great emptiness,Illusory compassion, and coarse and subtle symbols.One enters the practice of mahayoga by way of three contemplations: thecontemplation of the yoga of great emptiness (wisdom); the contemplationof illusory compassion (method); and the contemplation of coarse and subtlesymbols.15 Mahayoga is entered in this way because it is a path in which thephase of generation is the principal teaching. The tantra Self-Arising [Stateof Total Presence]16 states:Three types of contemplation serve as its entrance.THE VIEW OF MAHAYOGA [d']The view of the indivisibility of the two truths beyond thesphere of experienceIs conclusively established through the axioms of the fourunderstandings,Three purities, four samenesses, and the total state of being.In a general enumeration of the views associated with the stages of the path(wherein the views are applied), the great pioneer Buddhaguhya speaks ofnine: one, the view of the wisdom of ascertainment of the indivisibility ofthe two truths;17 two, the view of reality, that of great emptiness;18 three, theview of all-illuminating illusory compassion;19 four, the view of the singleseal, the union of appearance and emptiness;20 five, the view of the elabo-rate seal, the realization of the myriad of thoughts as the mandala;21 six, theview on the path of preparation of everything-in-one-group practice,22 whichuses objects of desire as the path; seven, the view on the path of seeing of thepower of body and life span,23 which is mastery of unconditioned total pres-ence; eight, the view on the path of meditation of the great seal, in which themind never strays from the sameness of the true nature of things: nine, theview on the final path of spontaneous perfection, the knowledge that is pris-tine awareness devoid of any object. Additionally, Buddhaguhya speaks of"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"MAHAYOGA\u0002317nine types of views on the meaning of tantra as the object of practice:24 theview of the pledges not to be transgressed, the view of the conduct inwhich there is nothing to be practiced or avoided, and the other [seven].[These views are set forth] because all of those topics of tantra are to becontemplated having been sealed with the view of the indivisibility of thetwo truths.What follows now is a detailed explanation of the meaning of the view asthe characteristic of knowledge which is the [primary] cause [of awaken-ing],25 also known as the view of the wisdom of ascertainment, or the viewof essential reality (among the ten topics [of the tantras]):26The superior ultimate truth is posited as the ineffable [state of ] totalpresence, spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of manifestation. Thecreative energy of that presence—the myriad of thoughts—which mani-fests in and of itself as the mandala of awakened dimensions and pristineawarenesses is posited to be the superior relative truth.27 Neither one of thesetwo truths represents solely the side of appearance or the side of emptinessbecause the truths manifest as a total sameness, in essence indivisible.28Although the two truths are designated as “indivisible,” this indivisibiltyis not within the sphere of experience because it transcends the objects ofthe thoughts and expressions that [try to] capture it. The description “supe-rior” is applied because the manner of realizing the two truths far surpassesthat of the way of characteristics. The axioms used to conclusively establish the indivisibility of the twotruths are not ones based on sophism and fallacious reasonings but are in-stead the extraordinary four great [sets of ] axioms:29 the axioms of the fourunderstandings, the three purities, the four samenesses, and the total stateof being.THE FOUR UNDERSTANDINGS [i']The axioms of the four understandings are the means by which all phenom-ena are conclusively established as the indivisibility of the [two] truths. Whatis taken as the basis for evaluation [in the first axiom] is adherence on thepart of the dualistic mind which apprehends as separate the appearances ofcyclic life and perfect peace. The means of evaluation is that of the axiom ofthe identical cause through which all phenomena are established as being ofan unborn nature.Likewise, adherence to the conclusion established from each of the pre-vious axioms is then taken as the basis of evaluation30 for the next axiom."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"318\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAEvaluations by means of the axioms of the mode of letters, the empoweringenergy, and the direct cognizance establish conclusions in the followingsequence: [on the basis of the conclusion that] all phenomena are of anunborn nature, the axiom of the mode of letters establishes [the radiance ofthe unborn nature] as unimpeded expressive energy;31 the axiom of theempowering energy establishes that [the unborn nature and the unimpededexpressive energy] are in essence indivisible; and the axiom of direct cogni-zance establishes that such reality transcends the intellect.As to the ways these are evaluated, the subject of the first axiom is allphenomena included within cyclic existence and perfect peace. All share anidentical cause32 in being mind nature, the unborn dimension of naturallypresent pristine awareness. [This is so] because the phenomena of cyclicexistence and perfect peace seem to appear separately depending on whetheror not they are realized to be of an identical nature, although they have noseparate existence whatsoever. Thus is stated the axiom of the identicalcause.The subject of the second axiom is the radiance of the unborn nature ofmind. The unimpeded expressive energy of such radiance manifests in andby itself as the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristineawarenesses. [That this is so is] understood through the example of the[meaning represented by] the letter a, which itself cannot be pointed out,but which manifests as many letters that point to it. Thus is stated theaxiom of the mode of letters.33The subject of the third axiom is both the unborn nature [of mind] andthe unimpeded expressive energy. Although referred to with different words,when the two are understood to be indivisible, there spontaneously arisesthe empowering energy of understanding their true nature as an indivisibleessence. [This is so] because the superior ultimate truth is spontaneouslyperfect as the essential cause of the seven riches, and when its [illusory]appearances cease, the environment and its inhabitants naturally manifestas the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses.Thus is stated the axiom of the empowering energy.34The subject of the fourth axiom is the indivisibility of the [two] truths[unborn nature and unimpeded expressive energy]. Such indivisibility tran-scends mind’s sphere of experience. This is so because, through direct cog-nizance of total presence, the indivisibility is understood to be intrinsicclarity devoid of any object, inexpressible and inconceivable. Thus is statedthe axiom of direct cognizance.35"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"MAHAYOGA\u0002319THE THREE PURITIES [ii']The axiom of the three purities is taught [in the Secret Essence Tantra]:36The environment, its inhabitants, and mental continuums areunderstood to be pure.The subject of this axiom is outer and inner phenomena which appear inthis way [as environment, inhabitants, and their mental continuums]. Allare, and have always been, in a state of enlightenment as the mandalas ofthe dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses. [This is so] becausethey are endowed with three purities. That is because the five elementalproperties of the environmental world are pure in being the five femaleconsorts [of the buddhas]; the five aggregates of the inhabitants are pure inbeing the five male buddhas; and the mental continuums, the eightfoldgroup of consciousnesses, are pure in being the five pristine awarenesses.37THE FOUR SAMENESSES [iii']The axiom of sameness is taught [in the Secret Essence Tantra]:38By virtue of two samenesses and two superior samenesses[All things are] the mandala of the realm of Samantabhadra.The subject is phenomena appearing in the way they do. All are, from thevery beginning, in a state of enlightenment as the dimension of reality.[This is so] because they are endowed with the four samenesses.Of the four, two are common, and two, superior. The first of the twocommon samenesses [is explained in this way]: A person appearing as aperson is an appearance that is conventionally real. A pile of stones appear-ing to be a person is an appearance that is conventionally unreal. Both theconventionally real and the conventionally unreal are the same in beingappearances that are illusions.The second common sameness [is explained as follows:] To overcomeonly one aspect of conceptual constructs, such as to understand that a sproutdoes not arise from [a cause that is of the same nature as] itself, is a partialultimate truth.39 To overcome all conceptual constructed limits, such as toovercome the constructs of the four limits ([understanding] that a sproutdoes not arise from itself, from another, [from both, or from neither])40 is"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"320\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe all-encompassing ultimate truth. Both the partial and the all-encom-passing ultimate truths are the same in being unborn. Those are the twocommon samenesses.The first of the two superior samenesses is as follows: A thing that ap-pears and can perform a function is conventionally real. A thing that ap-pears but cannot perform a function is conventionally unreal. Both theconventionally real and conventionally unreal are conditioned karmic ap-pearances and therefore conventionally unreal. Thus, both are the samein being the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristineawarenesses.As to the second superior sameness, emptiness [posited] as absolute ne-gation, that is, as the emptiness of self-nature of all phenomena, is the par-tial ultimate truth. Emptiness as an affirmative negation that is the union ofthe ultimate dimension of phenomena and pristine awareness, the nature ofmind existing as nothing whatsoever, is the all-encompassing ultimate truth.Both the partial and the all-encompassing ultimate truths are the same inbeing spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of the ultimate seven riches.Thus is stated the axiom of the four samenesses.THE TOTAL STATE OF BEING [iv']The axiom of the total state of being41 is taught [in the Secret Essence Tantra]:42Naturally present pristine awareness manifests with no fixed abode.The subject of the axiom is all phenomena of cyclic existence and perfectpeace. Phenomena seem to appear as a multitude [of things], but in actual-ity, this is not the case. This is so because, from the very beginning, every-thing abides as the total state of being, that of great naturally present pristineawareness alone, the unborn nature of mind. Thus, the Array [of the Path ofthe Net of Magical Manifestation] states:43All this appearance is consciousness aloneDevoid of inherent self-nature: naturally presentPristine awareness, manifesting with no fixed abode.Thus, the view of mahayoga, established conclusively by those axioms, isthe understanding of uncontrived reality, the indivisibility of the [two] su-perior truths."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"MAHAYOGA\u0002321The riches referred to in the expression “seven riches” means riches likethose found in a treasure of inexhaustible wealth. The seven consist of thethree [ultimates], the ultimate of dimensions, the ultimate of pristineawarenesses, and the ultimate of results, the last comprising [five] subparts,the five inexhaustible ornaments of the body, speech, mind, qualities, andactivity of the awakened state. The first, the ultimate of dimensions, ex-ists as the emptiness aspect; the second, the ultimate of pristine awarenesses,as the clarity aspect; and the last, the ultimate of results, as the basis ofemanations.MEDITATION IN MAHAYOGA [e']There are two meditation [traditions]: sadhana and tantra.THE SADHANA [TRADITION] [i']For meditation in the sadhana tradition, eight systems ofknowledgeAre taught: the four channel-wheels; three neighs of the horse;Eight syllables of ru lu; Pure Nectar; four piercings;Channels and winds; and observance of worship andpropitiation.As for meditation in mahayoga, in the tradition that emphasizes sadhanapractice, the eight [systems of ] knowledge of the eight sets of sadhanas aretaught.44 As to their general meaning, at the time of the ground, the truenature of the eightfold group of consciousnesses is present as the essence ofthe nine vast spaces of pristine awareness.45 At the time of the path, there ismanifestation as the mudras, mantras, and contemplations of the eight majorsadhanas. At the time of the result, there is full awakening to essential real-ity, known as “Glorious Heruka.” The particular meanings of the eightsadhanas [are explained next]:[First,] [the practices of ] the knowledge of Manjushri [tantras of awak-ened body] are known as the “transformation of the life[-force] into pristineawareness” by means of the rotation of the four channel-wheels46 at the fourplaces [of the body].

The second derives from the true nature of thethree realms of existence.49 The third accomplishes the ten awakened ac-tivities through the ten symbolic mandalas [of Manjushri Yamantaka].The ten are these:Appeasing, enriching, dominating, killing, summoning,Expelling, dividing, stupefying, maddening, and suppressing...The fourth is the understanding that all things are manifestations createdby mind. These four channel-wheels are also connected to the ground, thepath, and the result.[Second,] all [practices] of the knowledge of Padma, awakened speech,50are contained in the “three neighs of the horse.”51 It is stated:All the sadhanas of Padma, awakened speech,Are concentrated in the three neighsWherein is natural pristine awareness.Primordial, naturally present pristine awareness [manifests] with divine pride[in the form] of the glorious Hayagriva and neighs three times. With thefirst neigh, all phenomena of cyclic existence and perfect peace are under-stood to be uncreated and yet spontaneously perfect. With the second neigh,the environment and its inhabitants are transformed into an ocean of meat,blood, and bones, to be enjoyed by mamos52 and sky-farers. With the thirdneigh, all mamos and sky-farers are persuaded to obey commands and carryout duties entrusted to them.[Third,] all [practices] of Vishuddha are contained in the knowledge ofthe “holding enlightenment in one’s fist” [practice of ] continuous contem-plation.

However, if onewho is not so endowed were to practice this conduct, not only wouldliberation not be achieved but there would also be a great risk of fallinginto bad forms of life. Such a method is therefore very risky, likened tothe use of the mercury makshika [used in alchemy to transform iron intogold].67This path of method comprises two aspects, as stated [in the OceanicMagical Manifestation]:68There are esoteric instructions for the upper door and the lowerdoor.The former instruction concerns meditation done in a sequential way. Itrelies on the six channel-wheels of the upper door of one’s own body.69 Throughapplying the practice of the blazing [of the inner heat] and the dripping [ofvital essence], one experiences the pristine awareness of great bliss as describedin the Explanatory Tantra of the Oceanic [Magical Manifestation].70The latter instruction concerns a simultaneous approach. It relies on[the union of ] the “space” [of the female] and “secret” [of the male] at thelower door of another’s body [that of the consort]. Through application ofthe four-branched practice (familiarization, complete familiarization, at-tainment, and great attainment), in an instant one forcibly elicits the pris-tine awareness of bliss and emptiness, thereby perfecting the stages and thepaths at the same time.71 This path of method of simultaneity is explainedin the All-Surpassing Explanatory Tantra.72THE PATH OF LIBERATION [bb']The path of liberation is endowed with three kinds of wisdom.Some achieve the result in a simultaneous way."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"326\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThose who proceed sequentially rely on the cause, the view ofwisdom,And the condition, contemplation with application, whichcomprises devotion meditation and definitive perfection.The path of liberation emphasizes wisdom of three kinds,73 through whichcertainty and understanding are gained. As a consequence, the fetters ofone’s mind are released by themselves and one becomes liberated in the vastspace of one’s true nature. Although this path does not possess the distinc-tive feature of swiftness characteristic of the path of method, the two pathsdo not differ in terms of arriving at the result at some point. Moreover, thispath is almost free of risk, like the kaustubha gemstone [that separates goldfrom ore gradually].74This path is differentiated according to the levels of faculties [of practi-tioners] into two, the simultaneous and the sequential. In the first, libera-tion is attained [simultaneous] with the time of initiation, as in the case of[King] Indrabhuti.75 Concerning the second, the Tantra of the Secret Essencestates:76The retention of the characteristics of knowledge andapplicationConstitutes the cause and condition that bring to maturation theresult.Whoever is possessed of their power and potency becomesrenownedThroughout the realm of the victorious awareness-holders.That [sequential path] has three aspects: the cause, which is the view, thecharacteristic of knowledge; the condition, contemplation, the characteris-tic of application; and the result, [the state of ] awareness-holder. The firsthas been described above. The second aspect, contemplation, comprises thetwo, devotion meditation and definitive perfection.77 These methods, dis-tinguished with respect to the stages of the meditative process,78 will bepresented [in subsequent sections of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].CONDUCT IN MAHAYOGA [f ']Conduct in the path of method is deliberate behavior; and inthe path of liberation, conscientiousness."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"MAHAYOGA\u0002327Two forms of conduct serve as aids to meditation: the deliberate behavior79in the path of method; and the conduct of conscientiousness in the path ofliberation.

In thefirst procedure, thirty-six initiations, complete in the “four rivers” of theouter, inner, attainment, and secret initiations, are conferred in the mandalasof the Root Scripture,2 in accordance with what is explicitly taught in thattantra, on exceptional students who are naturally qualified and have anearnest interest in the profound meaning [of wisdom].In the second procedure, eight hundred and thirty-one short ancillaryinitiations (derived from the thirty-six root initiations of the [All-] Unifying[Pure Presence] Scripture which encompasses all ways [to realization]) areconferred on ordinary students who are qualified by virtue of training andhave an earnest interest in the vastness [of methods]. These initiations areconferred in accordance with the List of Rituals That Illuminates Great Bliss3in which the tradition of the entire [All-Unifying Pure Presence] Scripture issubdivided into individual ancillary mandalas.Nowadays, masters have adopted the practice of incorporating into asingle system the key elements of those two traditions, the tantras and theesoteric instructions, and conferring those initiations accordingly. Such apractice has the immediate advantage of being easy to perform, as well asachieving in the long run the special purpose of ensuring that neither sys-tem declines in favor of the other and that both are propagated together.Both those traditions are alike in that they contain all four yogas4 and allthe initiations of the nine ways. The Analysis of the Meaning of Initiation states:5Ten initiations confer the awakened lineage;And eleven initiations, the inner and secret meaning.Thirteen initiations are known as the great master;The two perfect the initiations of the nine ways."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"332\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThus, this tradition of the entire [All-Unifying Pure Presence] Scripture doesnot represent a general [initiation] ritual compiled from rituals specific toeach of the eight ways. Instead, this is a system particular to the elucidation[i.e., anuyoga] system in which one travels through the stages [of awaken-ing] beginning with the first undetermined stage6 up to and including thetenth stage. For this, one receives the tenfold initiation sequence (actionand conduct tantras counted separately) starting with the initiation of [theway of ] gods and humans up to the finality of the completion phase of theanuyoga system, which is [called] atiyoga.7 This tenfold initiation sequencecorresponds to that of the system of the nine ways when action and conductare considered one and is therefore called the “initiation of the nine ways.”These ways [to realization], which are supportive paths [of anuyoga’sown path], incorporate elements similar to those of their individual paths.More than that, however, being essentially possessed of mantra’s skillfulmeans, they provide a swift path that gives rise to the various qualities thatare similar to the kinds of relinquishments and attainments associated withthese different paths.ENTRANCE BY APPLICATION [ii']Entrance is through the union of the ultimate dimension andpristine awareness, in which there is perfection withoutgeneration.The entrance to this way [of anuyoga] is by way of the nonduality of theultimate dimension [of phenomena] and pristine awareness. The MajesticCreative Energy says:8Those who aspire to the level of indivisibility in anuyoga,Having entered the way of the ultimate dimension and pristineawareness...How does one enter? Not through generation, but through the mode ofperfection.

The General Scripturethat Unifies the Knowledge of All Buddhas says:10Since everything is one in the state of pure being,All is the great bliss of primordial enlightenment,The essence beyond arising and cessation.All is the three mandalas that transcend action,Primordially present and spontaneously perfect.Of the three mandalas mentioned in that [passage], the first, “the mandalaof primordial suchness,” is the vast space of total purity of the motherSamantabhadri, the unborn nature of mind, beyond all conceptual limita-tions, in which everything that exists, all phenomena of cyclic existence andperfect peace, is included as the natural creative energy of mind.The second, “the mandala of the spontaneously perfect nature,” is natu-rally present pristine awareness, Samantabhadra, whose very manifesta-tion freely pervades the totality of that [vast space] without any restrictionwhatsoever.The third, “the mandala of original pure and perfect mind” is great bliss,the offspring, which is the nonduality of the ultimate dimension [of phe-nomena] and pristine awareness, the two first mandalas being in essence aninseparable union.11"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"334\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAMEDITATION IN ANUYOGA [e']Meditation comprises the upper and lower techniques in thepath of method, and establishing the meaning andexpression in signsIn the path of liberation, thus forming the utterly perfectpath.Concerning meditation in the anuyoga system, the Fundamental Meaning[of the Secret Discourse] says:12The essence, method and wisdom...Thus, two paths of meditation are specified: the path of certainty throughmethod and the path of liberation through wisdom.THE PATH OF METHOD [i']The first is the method to realize the innate pristine awareness of bliss fromthe melting [of vital essence], immutable supreme bliss. It comprises two[sets of ] esoteric instructions. One concerns the “upper door,” a sequentialmethod to elicit innate pristine awareness through meditation techniquesrelated to the four channel-wheels.13 The other concerns the “lower door,” amethod of simultaneity to elicit innate pristine awareness by means of theunion of the “space” [of the female] and the “secret” [of the male].THE PATH OF LIBERATION [ii']Concerning the path of liberation, the same text says:Proceeding by means of study, reflection, and meditation,One enters that [path] by three approaches:The minds of analysis, the meaning, and letters.First, to enter by way of analysis is to establish conclusively the view, whichis a prerequisite for the path. This involves discerning examination ofknowable objects by means of logical reasoning that brings about under-standing of them.14 As a result, the authentic condition of all phenom-ena, the true nature, primordial suchness, is conclusively established as"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"ANUYOGA AND ATIYOGA\u0002335the inexpressible, inconceivable, and indescribable nature of the threemandalas. [This represents] the tenet, or view, of this system [of anuyoga],as it has just been explained. Second, to enter by way of the meaning is to remain in contemplationwithout thoughts or symbolic attributes. The object of meditation is thestate of the true nature of reality just as it is. Moreover, the meditating mindis placed in exactly the same state. This is known as “establishing [actuallyabiding in] the meaning [indicated by the view].”Third, to enter by way of letters refers to contemplation of a deity withsymbolic attributes. With the simple utterance of the seed-syllable or themantra that generates the particular support [the deity’s environment] andthe supported [the deity], all of the universe and inhabitants, like the flashof a fish from water, is imagined clearly and distinctly as the palace and thecircle of deities of the mandala. Practice that emphasizes this form of medi-tation is known as the “expression in signs.”From the perspective of the utterly perfect path formed by those, anuyogaincludes both the conditioned [or mundane paths] and unconditioned [orsupramundane paths]. The first comprises the yoga of the aspiring mind [ofthe path of accumulation] and the yoga that reveals the great buddha family[of the path of preparation]. The second comprises the yoga that confersgreat encouragement [of the path of seeing], the yoga that receives the greatprophetic declaration [of the path of meditation], and the yoga that per-fects great creative energy [of the final path].15Those are connected to the three yogas: the cause (the object ofthe action);The condition (the action); and the result (transcendence ofaction).The ground to be realized, or view, and those paths that lead to realizationare connected to, or included within, three yogas: the yoga of the cause (theobject of the action); the yoga of the condition (the action itself ); and theyoga of result (transcendence of action).The first refers to the authentic condition of all phenomena, that whichabides perfectly and distinctly as the nature of the three mandalas.The second refers to the three ways of the proclaimers, solitary sages,and bodhisattvas, which, through application of [those] paths with effort,enable one to transcend cyclic existence and thereby enter the provisionalresult of peace."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"336\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe third refers to the ways of the outer and inner mantra systems which,since mind’s true nature is primordially and intrinsically pure, are free fromthe hope and fear involved in the effort of searching for the result [of awak-ening] outside of oneself.Those two latter yogas are known as the “general common path.” In theanuyoga system, the above three yogas are classified according to the dis-tinctions between the path of method and that of liberation. The first refersto the [real] meaning of tantra [“continuum”], that which is to be known;the second, to the sequential practice based on effort; and the third, to one’snatural condition devoid of effort.CONDUCT IN ANUYOGA [f ']The conduct is that of the empowering energy, the dominatingconduct, and conduct of method.The conduct of anuyoga, as a general rule, is principally conduct in thestate of total sameness.16 The Miraculous Key to the Storehouse says:Anuyoga of completion is the perfect enjoymentOf the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness.Specifically, anuyoga conduct is of three types: the conduct of empoweringenergy, the dominating conduct, and the conduct of method. The GeneralScripture [That Unifies the Knowledge of All Buddhas] says:17The conduct of empowering energy,Dominating conduct, and conduct of methodAre likened to the sky, and to a king,And to a river [that quenches] fire.18THE RESULT OF ANUYOGA [g']The result is great bliss, spontaneously perfect, the twenty-fiveaspects.The result of meditation on this path is to actualize, within one lifetime,the body of great bliss, which is the essential nature of the four dimensionsof awakening, the spontaneously perfect essence indivisible from the twenty-five resultant aspects [of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity].19 TheTantra of the Supreme Sphere says:20"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"ANUYOGA AND ATIYOGA\u0002337Mind’s nature of luminous clarity is the nondualityOf the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness.Whoever meditates on this great bliss will attainThe result of perfect enlightenment in this lifetime.THE ATIYOGA SYSTEM [3']The esoteric instructions system of atiyoga is presented in seven parts: es-sence, meaning of the name, entrance, view, meditation, conduct, and re-sult.THE ESSENCE OF ATIYOGA [a']The essence of atiyoga is direct liberation in the state ofprimordial enlightenmentWithout renunciation or acceptance, hope or fear.The essence of the atiyoga way is [a system whose] nature is the method todirectly self-liberate in the state of primordial enlightenment, without re-nunciation, acceptance, hope or fear.21THE MEANING OF THE NAME ATIYOGA [b']It is the supreme training, the summit of all ways.[The Sanskrit] atiyoga is [rendered in Tibetan as] shin tu rnal ’byor (supremetraining), [so called] because it represents the final level of perfection ofboth the generation and completion [phases], and because it stands at thesummit of all ways.ENTRANCE TO ATIYOGA [c']The entrance to atiyoga is twofold: entrance by initiation; and entrance byapplication.ENTRANCE BY INITIATION [i']The initiations are elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate,and utterly unelaborate."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"338\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAtiyoga initiations do not need to rely on the example pristine awareness[revealed] through the third initiation [of pristine awareness through wis-dom]. Right from the start, fortunate students qualified to enter the mandalaof the ultimate awakening mind are conferred the initiation of the creativeenergy of total presence22 of the great perfection [system]. [The meaningof ] this initiation is as stated by the master Manjushrimitra in his EssentialMeaning of the Net of Magical Manifestation of Manjushri:23The supreme initiation of profound reality is to attainThe initiation of the creative energy of total presence.Being the realization of mind’s nature, it is known as “initiation”:The conferral of the diadem of the pristine awareness initiation.In particular, in accordance with the [atiyoga] division of esoteric instruc-tions, there are four initiations as stated in the Naturally Present Perfection:24The elaborate, unelaborate,The very unelaborate, and utterly unelaborate:Four initiations in four aspectsEffect the ripening of the fortunate.The four initiations, in sequence, purify the obscurations of body, speech,and mind, and the obscurations to omniscience; and establish the potenciesfor awakened body, speech, and mind, and naturally present luminous clar-ity. They empower [the student] in the four practices: the phase of genera-tion, meditation on inner heat, and meditation on the union of bliss andemptiness (through which are realized the pristine awareness of primordialpurity), and the practice to directly experience the state of spontaneousperfection, respectively.These initiations represent four divisions within the higher initiation[the fourth]. Hence, although in number they are equal to the commoninitiations of highest yoga tantra, one should understand that their mean-ing is different. Furthermore, one must accept that a person who has re-ceived the mantric vows of the fourth initiation in common with the highestyoga tantra will be assuming a new set of vows not previously taken whenhe or she receives these particular initiations.ENTRANCE BY APPLICATION [ii']One enters by way of no action or effort whatsoever."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"ANUYOGA AND ATIYOGA\u0002339Atiyoga is entered by means of no action or effort of any kind. The MajesticCreative Energy of the Universe states:25Since the real nature requires no action[Atiyoga] is entered by way of effortlessness.THE VIEW OF ATIYOGA [d']This is discussed in two parts: the general view of atiyoga; and the viewsspecific to the divisions on mind,26 vast space, and esoteric instructions.THE GENERAL VIEW OF ATIYOGA [i']The view asserts that everything is the total sphere of thedimension of reality,Naturally present pristine awareness, effortless primordialenlightenment.The view of atiyoga asserts that everything that exists, all phenomena in-cluded in cyclic life and perfect peace, is the total sphere of the dimensionof reality, in essence, naturally present great pristine awareness.27 As such,all is primordially enlightened, without action or effort. The Total Space [ofVajrasattva] states:28Naturally present pristine awareness [requires] no effort;Through its own [self-]liberation, it reveals the path to liberation.VIEWS SPECIFIC TO THE MIND, VAST SPACE, AND ESOTERICINSTRUCTIONS DIVISIONS [ii']This section has two parts: the general views of the three divisions; and thedistinctive views within each division.THE GENERAL VIEWS OF THE THREE DIVISIONS [aa']The respective views of the divisions of mind, vast space, andesoteric instructions assertFreedom from the limit of something to renounce, as nophenomenon is other than mind;"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"340\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAFreedom from the limit of remedies, as phenomena are totallyperfected in the vast space of the true nature;Transcendence of renunciations and remedies, as all are of thereal condition already established.The view of atiyoga is divided according to distinctions in understandingbased on the [practitioner’s] level of faculties. This yields three divisions, asnoted in the Great Array:29The division on mind is for persons inclined to intellectualization;The vast space division, for those inclined to the dimension of space;And the esoteric instructions division, for those who do not striveafter stages.Accordingly, the views of the three divisions of atiyoga are as follows: Thedivision on mind [asserts] freedom from the limiting [concept] of things tobe renounced since all phenomena are nothing other than mind’s nature.30The vast space division which transcends action [asserts] freedom from thelimiting [concept] of remedial measures since all phenomena are totallyperfected in the primordial space of Samantabhadri, the true nature [ofthings]. The esoteric instructions division of profundity [asserts] freedomfrom the limiting [concepts] of both things to be renounced and remedialmeasures since the essential characteristic of everything is the real condition[already] established.31DISTINCTIVE VIEWS WITHIN EACH DIVISION [bb']This section has three parts: distinctions within the division on mind; dis-tinctions within the vast space division; and distinctions within the esotericinstructions division.DISTINCTIONS WITHIN THE DIVISION ON MIND [1\"] The division on mind has seven distinctions. ...The general view, or tenet, of the mind division [is presented first]. All thatconstitutes the compounded truth of the path—the stages of the ways, thetwo truths, generation and completion, and so forth, as well as conditionedfetters owing to rigid notions of adherence to those elements—is asserted tobe the pristine awareness of total sameness, the nature of original pure and"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"ANUYOGA AND ATIYOGA\u0002341perfect mind, the ineffable, ultimate dimension of phenomena, the funda-mental nature of ultimate truth, the great dimension of total freedom fromcause and result, virtue and evil, and acceptance and rejection. In short,[the view] represents the transcendence of all phenomena which manifestas the dualism of apprehended and apprehender.In accordance with this generally accepted view [of the mind division],seven distinctions are made. The first distinction in the mind division viewasserts that the result is the source of mind. The result is the primordialultimate dimension, within which no change occurs; and therefore, in mind,there is no movement or change. [Yet] from that changeless state, the spon-taneously perfect appearance aspect of the very ground of freedom mani-fests as what seems to be cyclic life. However, because mind has never shiftedfrom its [changeless] state, what manifests is empty of any characteristic ofimpurity. In terms of its appearance aspect, [that which manifests] arisesfrom, abides in, and dissolves back into the [primordial] ultimate dimen-sion, like a miraculous apparition in the sky: this is primordial freedom,without endeavor or effort, left on its own.The second distinction is the view of the transcendence of deviationsand obscurations. [This asserts] that the eight ways (from the way [of godsand humans] up to anuyoga) are deviations from the [primordial] groundbecause they are creations of the conceptual mind. In contrast, in this system,[the ground], naturally present pristine awareness, is beyond conceptual mind,and therefore transcends causes and conditions. Thus, there are no obscurationsin the true nature, that of total primordial emptiness, the real condition tran-scendent of thought, memory, limited positions, perceptions, and so on.The third distinction is the view concerning the collapse of the founda-tion of logical reasoning. Understanding of unmodified reality in the to-tally ineffable nature of mind, the ground, effects freedom in the unbornessence. Since unimpeded creative energy surges pervasively throughout totalopenness, there is no base where karmic traces [can accumulate]; thereforethe ripened results of good and bad actions do not exist. Thus, through the[indisputable] logic32 of the true nature of reality, primordially empty andnaturally purified, total freedom from all limits, there is freedom in thetotal sameness of cyclic existence and perfect peace.The fourth distinction is the view that [the true nature of reality] doesnot fall to one side and cannot be partitioned. This asserts that naturallypresent pristine awareness, mind’s nature, pervades the totality of cyclic lifeand perfect peace. However, it is not limited to what is substantial (appear-ance), nor is it limited to the nonsubstantial (emptiness). It does not fall to"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"342\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe side of being neither of those or their union. Its essence is empty andtherefore free from the limit of eternalism. Its creative energy is unimpededand thus free from the limit of nihilism. As such, it is the true nature ofreality, beyond action, transcending pleasure and pain.The fifth distinction is the view that [the true nature] transcends partialand limited philosophical positions. [This asserts that] mind’s essence doesnot abide anywhere, nor does it exist as anything; yet it appears in any wayat all, manifesting with no restriction whatsoever. Thus, although it mani-fests, there is nothing to refute, grasp, or conceptualize.The sixth distinction is the view that [the true nature] is beyond theconceptual mind and transcends limited positions. [This asserts] that sincenaturally present pristine awareness is beyond the conceptual mind, whateverappears does not exist as [something] true or false, and is therefore the expres-sive energy of total freedom from the limits of existence and nonexistence.The seventh distinction is the view that everything is part of mind. [Thisasserts] that all these appearances are the expressive energy of mind.33 There-fore, even though such energy manifests in a variety of ways, since minditself is without essence, the various appearances are also without essence.Moreover, the aspect of mind that apprehends what appears and the ap-pearance that is apprehended, although seeming to be separate, are insepa-rable in being naturally present pristine awareness, the true nature whichdoes not exist in any way. The spontaneously perfect manifestation of thenatural creative energy [of pristine awareness] arises as the duality of cycliclife and perfect peace, yet that which gives rise to appearance is devoid of[any] essence. Thus, cyclic existence and perfect peace are released on theirown, right where they arise.34 These are the distinctive features [of views]within the division on mind.35DISTINCTIONS WITHIN THE VAST SPACE DIVISION [2\"]...The vast space division has four aspects.The general tenet of the vast space division [is presented first]. In the vastspace of Samantabhadra, the true nature, naturally present pristine aware-ness, all phenomena, however they arise, are simply ornaments of manifes-tation that appear in and of themselves. Other than that, phenomena cannotbe defined as bound or free, as what appear or what generate appearance.Therefore, phenomena are not considered to be manifestations of the cre-ative energy or expressive energy [of mind] (as they are in the view of the"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"ANUYOGA AND ATIYOGA\u0002343division on mind). Instead, everything is understood to be boundless pri-mordial freedom, which cannot be analyzed in terms of relational proof,existence or non-existence, being or not being, purity or impurity.There are four distinctions [within the vast space division’s general view].The first distinction is [the view of ] black vast space propounded as the ab-sence of cause. This asserts that authentic, naturally present pristine awarenessitself is unchanging, its nature transcending causes and conditions, and beyondlimited aspects, and therefore unrelated to phenomena and their natures.The second distinction is [the view of ] multicolored vast space pro-pounded as diversity. This asserts that all that manifests as the expressiveenergy of naturally present pristine awareness is affirmed [in the sense of ]being the ornament and expressive energy of the true nature manifesting onits own as a variety, yet is negated [in the sense] that the expressive energymanifesting pervasively and unrestrictedly can be neither refuted nor proven.The third distinction is [the view of ] white vast space propounded as mind.This asserts that everything manifesting from the state of self-originated totalpresence—outer appearances and inner cognizance—is the expressive energyof mind. Since appearances and their conditions are liberated in their ownplace, all things are pure from the beginning, with nothing to be done. Suchis their authentic condition of being; thus, there is nothing to be realized.The fourth distinction is [the view of ] infinite vast space in which causeand result are transcended. This asserts that all phenomena which appearfrom the state of naturally present pristine awareness are perceived as ap-pearances by the mind, yet understood to be nonexistent by virtue of theirauthentic condition.36Within these distinctions are twelve further divisions,37 which form manycategories such as the four vast spaces (expressive energy, ornament, truenature, and transcendence of action).38DISTINCTIONS WITHIN THE ESOTERIC INSTRUCTIONS DIVISION [3\"]The esoteric instructions comprise the scattered teachings, oraltradition, and textual tradition of tantras.The last has cycles of outer, inner, secret, and most secretAs distinctions in the oral transmission and explanatory tantras.The view of the esoteric instructions division is superior to those of theprevious two divisions. In this system, the true nature of reality, primordi-ally pure and liberated from the beginning, is viewed in a way contrary to"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"344\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA[other systems. Other] bases and doctrines divide reality into objects ofobservation and observing consciousness and thereby validate the dichotomyof delusion and no delusion, or realization and no realization. [This view,however, asserts] that from the perspective of the very nature [of reality]which is beyond all conceptual constructs, both the object to be known andthe subject, the knowing consciousness, are equal in not being real. Exceptfor mere conventional usage, all thoughts and expressions that apprehendthat duality are genuinely transcended. That being the case, this view di-rectly flows to the essential point that is beyond intellect and analysis, therebyresembling moxabustion application.There are three distinctions [within the general view of the esoteric in-structions division]. The first is the view of the scattered teachings. [Thisasserts] that the true nature of reality is pristine awareness, which tran-scends the conceptual mind, arising instantaneously, without differentia-tion, exclusion, or reference.The second is the view of the oral tradition. [This asserts] that the truenature of reality is, in essence, beyond the conceptual mind and free fromdelusion. Its nature [effects] the collapse of the foundation of concep-tualization. Its character cannot be defined in any way.The third is the view taught in the textual tradition of tantras of theesoteric instructions division itself. [This asserts] that the true nature ofreality is the point of origin of all transmitted teachings. Its nature is be-yond cyclic life and perfect peace, and therefore devoid of something to berenounced or something to strive for. As it does not abide in sounds orwords, it is untouched by disputations concerning emptiness.39There are many further distinctions based on different aspects of theseviews.40 The principal ones, however, are distinctions within the third view,the four cycles that are renowned in the oral transmission and in the ex-planatory tantras: the outer cycle which resembles the body; the inner cyclewhich resembles the eyes; the secret cycle which resembles the heart; andthe most secret cycle which resembles the body as a whole. First is the view of the outer cycle. In terms of essence, [the true natureof reality] is devoid of emotional afflictions; thus, the five poisons are usedon the path. In nature, it involves neither effort nor attainment; thus, what-ever manifests arises as reality itself. In character, it has no parts; thus, thereis no division into emptiness and appearances.The second is the view of the inner cycle. In terms of essence, [the truenature of reality] transcends form; thus, it is a reality without conceptualcharacteristics. In nature, it neither comes nor goes; thus, it is unceasingly"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"ANUYOGA AND ATIYOGA\u0002345present pristine awareness. In character, it penetrates both cyclic life andperfect peace, thereby resembling the root of a tree. Its own “face” looks indifferent [directions], thereby resembling the trunk. Its manifestations ofcreative energy extend everywhere, thereby resembling branches. Its clarityaspect is unobstructed, thereby resembling flowers. Its various aspects ripeninto one, thereby resembling fruit.The third is the view of the secret cycle. In terms of essence, since [thetrue nature of reality] is introduced and realized simultaneously, it is unre-lated to the three kinds of wisdom. In nature, since the cessation of breath-ing [death] and liberation are simultaneous, reality is unrelated to the strengthof experience. In character, since enlightenment and the emergence of com-passionate energy are simultaneous, reality is unrelated to the two causalaccumulations.The fourth is the view of the most secret cycle. In terms of essence, [thetrue nature of reality] is not something to be known; thus, it is unrelated toan agent of knowing. In nature, it is directly seen; thus, reality is not thedomain of analysis. In character, it is reached in the ultimate dimension ofthe primordial ground through the four visionary appearances,41 withinthis very life, without generating hope for later results.MEDITATION IN ATIYOGA [e']Meditation in the mind division is to remain in total presenceand emptiness, the dimension of reality;In the vast space division, to remain in the state of the truenature without action or effort;In the esoteric instructions division, to remain in primordialfreedom without renunciation and acceptance.Meditation on the above views is of three forms: meditation in the divisionon mind is to remain in the state of total presence and emptiness, the di-mension of reality. The vast space division meditation is to remain in thestate of [one’s own] true nature with no action or effort. The esoteric in-structions division meditation is to remain in the state of primordial free-dom, the true nature which is beyond renunciation and acceptance.Generally, meditation in the great perfection tradition comprises twoaspects: the approach of total relaxation and the direct leap approach.42These are explained in detail in subsequent parts [of the Infinite Ocean ofKnowledge]."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"346\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRACONDUCT IN ATIYOGA [f ']Conduct is spontaneous; ...All appearances, whatever their forms, arise as the expressive energy of [one’sown] true nature.

The atiyoga of anuyoga is the nondualpristine awareness of total presence.47The mahayoga of atiyoga is the primordial presence of themandala of deities. The anuyoga of atiyoga is the identity of themandala of deities and one’s mind. The atiyoga of atiyoga is theessence of mind which cannot be defined in any way, its naturebeing spontaneously perfect.The Key to the Transmitted Teachings of Secret Mantra states:48The entirety of the secret mantra system is divided into three:tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions.

The great perfection system1 alone, for example, comprisessix million, four hundred thousand [four-line stanzas] of tantra. Of thesetantras which are as vast as the sky, those that were brought to the Land ofSnow and became renowned are as follows:The principal tantras of mahayoga are known as the eighteen principaltantras, comprising the five major root or fundamental tantras (of awak-ened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities); the five tantras of ex-pression, which expound the sadhana practice; the five tantras that concernthe practice of conduct; the two that are like continuation tantras, whichserve as supplements for what is incomplete; and the one major tantra,which is like a condensation of all the others.2 This last refers to the tantraof the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva, [also known as] the Glori-ous Secret Essence, Supreme King of Tantras that Ascertains Reality. The cycleof the Net of Magical Manifestation itself includes the eight major texts ofthe Magical Manifestation3 and the four major explanatory tantras.4 All theseare subsumed under the three categories of father tantras (Guhyasamaja,etc.); mother tantras (Buddhasamayoga, etc.); and nondual tantras (Net ofMagical Manifestation, Guhyagarbha, etc.).The tantras of anuyoga, in general, are composed of the twenty-one elu-cidation tantras, ten crucial scriptures, seventy texts of elucidation,5 and soon. Among these, the principal ones are the four root scriptures (All-Unify-ing Pure Presence,6 etc.), plus the especially renowned General Scripture ThatUnifies the Knowledge of All Buddhas, which constitute the five major scrip-tural elucidations.The tantras of atiyoga comprise the divisions of mind, vast space, andesoteric instructions. Of these, the first, that of the mind division, containsthe cycle of the Majestic Creative Energy of the Universe: Original Pure andPerfect Mind,7 the five tantras translated first and the thirteen translatedlater, together known as the eighteen mother and son tantras, plus generaltantras of the mind division.8 The second, the vast space division, has eleventantras, the King of Tantras of Infinite Vast Space, and so on.9 The third, theesoteric instructions division, contains the individual tantras of the outer,inner, and secret cycles of teachings.

Of these, the sixty-five tantras of pristine awareness and ac-tivation are known to have been translated into Tibetan.

Their meanings correspond towhat has been described as general methods of expounding the highest yogatantra system of the new tradition.14SPECIAL METHODS [ii]This section has two parts: methods for the tantra [tradition]; and those forthe sadhana [tradition]."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"352\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAWAYS TO TEACH THE TANTRAS [aa]As special methods, two styles of exposition, that of atiyoga andthat of mahayoga,Are used to teach the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva,The Secret Essence, King of Tantras That Ascertains Reality.There are special methods to expound [certain] mahayoga tantras. By ascer-taining simply [the meaning of ] the title “Net of Magical Manifestation ofVajrasattva, the Secret Essence That Ascertains Reality” [explained] in accor-dance with the tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions,15 the secretof what is contained in the unsurpassable tantra is understood. There havedeveloped a few methods of commentary on this “king of all tantras,” epito-mized in two styles of exposition: commentary according to the esotericinstructions of atiyoga; and commentary according to the generation phaseof mahayoga. The former represents the perspectives of the master NyiöSengé and the omniscient Longchen Rabjampa; the latter, of Lilavajra,Buddhaguhya, and other masters,16 and, for the most part, the holders ofthe Zur tradition of transmitted teachings.17The mahayoga style comprises the three exposition methods ofthe elders;The Zurpa tradition of the transmitted teachings presents fivetopics.Widely known at the present time is the discourse style of the mahayogasystem according to which the subject to be expounded is the King of Tantras,the Secret Essence, exalted by virtue of its eight great qualities. The means ofexposition incorporates the four [explanatory tantras]—the ExplanatoryTantra of the Oceanic Magical Manifestation; the All-Surpassing Tantra; theEssence of Pristine Awareness; and the Indestructible Mirror—and the threeideal cognitions.18 As to how expositions are given, the earlier masters usedthree methods: [The first,] known as teaching “by grasping the top as onewould an arrow,” explains the tantra’s title wherein the ground, path, andresult are contained. [The second,] known as teaching “by grasping the neckas one would a spear,” is as stated in the fifth chapter [of the Secret Essence]:19The retention of the characteristics of knowledge and applicationConstitutes the cause and condition that bring to maturation the result."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"TANTRIC SCRIPTURES AND EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002353Whoever is possessed of their power and potency becomesrenownedThroughout the realm of the victorious awareness-holders.This method of exposition incorporates three characteristics: one, the char-acteristic of knowledge, the view (the primary cause for enlightenment);two, the characteristic of application, contemplation (the condition); andthree, the characteristic of the result brought about by the path, the fourkinds of awareness-holder.[The third,] known as teaching “by grasping the handle as one would asword,” is an exposition that contains the four manifestations [presented]in the two verses of the last chapter [of the Secret Essence]: the ground, thenatural manifestation; wrong notions, the manifestation of deception; stu-dents to be guided, the manifestation of the path; and the result, the mani-festation of the joyful ones.In the Zurpa tradition of transmitted teachings, the style of expositioncomprises five topics: the way of being of phenomena, their nature; the waydeceptive appearances arise from not realizing that nature; the way an om-niscient one knows; the way compassion develops from love; and the way toaccomplish the welfare of beings.At the present time, the title is taught to the most adept; ananalysis, to the average;And the meaning of the words, to the least adept; this isVimalamitra’s way.The style of exposition used at the present time is the one set forth inVimalamitra’s Fundamental Text:20To the most adept, the title is taught; to the average, an analysis [ofthe text];And to the least adept, the meaning of the words is taught.Accordingly, there are three methods: to a person of superior faculties, anexposition on the basis of the title is given; to one of average faculties, ananalysis of the general content of the tantra is presented; and to the leastadept, a commentary providing the word-by-word meaning is given.The first consists in an exposition of three [meanings of the] title inaccordance with the tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions, com-"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"354\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAbined with an exposition on the path of method of the upper door and thepath of method of the secret lower door.The second consists in both analysis of the sets of contents and analysisof the sets of words [of the tantra]. The former comprises five points: origin(the source of the tantra); secondary conditions (scene of the promulgationof the tantra); result (the meaning of the tantra to be fully understood);purpose served by the tantra and the way it is connected to its purpose; andthe teachings to the audience and entrustment of the tantra.The third consists in an exposition that sets forth the essence, semanticmeanings of the words, and differentiations [between terms].Those three methods lead to direct ascertainment of the tantra by rely-ing principally on wisdom derived from study and reflection.The ten topics of the tantra—view, conduct, mandala, initiation,Pledges, activations, sadhanas, contemplation, offerings,mantras and mudras—Serve as instrumental conditions for the path.The ten topics of the tantras are these: the view (essential reality); conduct(transcendence); mandala (the manifestation); initiation (the sequential pro-cess of conferral); pledges (what are not to be transgressed); activations (ex-pressive energy); sadhana (what is to be practiced); contemplation (stillness);offerings (to fulfill the goal); mantras to be recited and mudras to be ex-ecuted. Those ten serve as instrumental conditions for the path of the practi-tioner. All of the most important contents of the tantric scriptures are evidentlycategorized and expounded as the “ten topics of the tantras” owing to theirassociation with the practice of actualization [of the deity]. In short, the tenrepresent sequential instructions for training in the practice of actualization[of the deity] by relying principally on wisdom derived from meditation.WAYS TO TEACH THE SADHANAS [bb]Sadhanas are understood through twenty methods: the fivesummaries,Five tantric guidelines, five combined elucidations, and fiveunification systems.Tantras in the sadhana [tradition] are taught by means of twenty methods ofexposition.

The five tantric guidelines provide an expanded commentary onthat meaning. The five combined elucidations set forth general combina-tions of fundamental teachings. The five systems of unification integratethe contents with the student’s mind. By means of these, understanding [ofthe tantras of the sadhana tradition] is gained.The first five, the general summaries, serve as keys to the treasury of thesecret mantra transmitted teachings. They combine the essential outlinedteachings of the five elucidations of mantra and elucidations of sadhanaand ascertain the teacher, the teaching, and the meanings of the words thatconvey the essential definitive meaning.The second five, the tantric guidelines, provide explanatory statementson the table of contents [of the tantra]; set forth additional words and syl-lables through connections; present the abbreviated meaning through in-structions; organize miscellaneous topics by connecting their contexts; andteach the practice through esoteric instructions.The third five, the combined elucidations, present the merging of tantrawith elucidation; the merging of elucidation with sadhana; the merging ofsadhana with activities; the merging of activities with practical application;and the merging of practical application with experience.The fourth five, the systems of unification, comprise the unification ofthe root [tantra] and the sadhana; unification of sadhana and activities;unification of activities and essential meditation instructions; unification ofessential meditation instructions and contemplation; and unification ofcontemplation and esoteric instructions.EXPOSITION METHODS IN ANUYOGA [b]Anuyoga is understood through seven elucidations: view,generation phase,Mantra to be recited, union, release, offering, and propitiation.The Heruka Galpo Tantra sets forth the scriptural elucidations of anuyoga[tantras]:"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"356\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAEnlightenment in phenomenal existence is the elucidation of theview.Clarity in the seal of the deity’s body is the elucidation of thegeneration phase.Perseverance in recitation and familiarization is the elucidation ofmantra.The ultimate dimension of reality enjoyed as consort is theelucidation of union.Elimination of [beings complete in] ten areas21 is the elucidation ofrelease.The foods of the circle of the [tantric feast] gathering is theelucidation of offering.Receiving initiation and gaining powers is the elucidation of greatattainment.Anuyoga elucidations are to be understood in terms of those seven.EXPOSITION METHODS IN ATIYOGA [c]Atiyoga is taught using the six general meanings: fiveteachingsOn the path, with examples; and the result, which is beyondexamples.The great perfection atiyoga tantras are expounded using six general mean-ings: the five teachings on the path for which there are examples, plus oneteaching on the result, which is beyond examples.These are the five teachings that use examples: teaching on the pristineawareness of the ground, using the example of pure space; teaching on theview of the authentic condition, using the example of the [baby] garudabird which has fully developed wings [when hatched]; teaching on medita-tive equipoise, using the example of the ocean to which all waters haveflowed and merged; teaching on overcoming the analytical approach, usingthe example of the lion’s roar; and teaching on the perfect result, using theexample of the wish-granting tree.This is the one teaching on the result, for which there is no example: theultimate authentic condition, spontaneous perfection which need not besought, is the original buddha, Samantabhadra, the supreme of the reality"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"TANTRIC SCRIPTURES AND EXPOSITION METHODS\u0002357dimension of awakening, the great forefather of cyclic life and perfect peace.This nature cannot be realized through sophistic reasoning or conventionalexamples or words, but is directly pointed out as one’s natural conditionthrough the symbols of the introduction.22"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"358\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"APPENDIX: OUTLINE OF THE TEXT\u0002359APPENDIX:OUTLINE OF THE TEXT[Chapter 1: The Nature of Tantra71]I.

Zurkar Lodrö Gyalpo (1509-1585), born in Zurkar, a place in Latok in the region ofDakpo in southern Tibet, nephew of Zurkar Nyamnyi Dorjé, founder of the Zur tradi-tion of Tibetan medicine.CHAPTER 1: THE NATURE OF TANTRA1. The new tradition of secret mantra (gsang sngags gsar ma’i lugs), which originated withthe later translations (phyi ’gyur) of tantras from Sanskrit, refers to the lineages of theKagyu (bKa’ brgyud), Sakya (Sa skya), and Geluk (dGe lugs) traditions. The Kagyu (Trans-mission of Oral Teachings) lineage begins with Marpa the Translator (1012-1099); theSakya (Grey Earth) lineage, with Könchok Gyalpo (dKon mchog rgyal po) (1034-1102);and the Geluk (Virtuous Ones) lineage, with Tsongkapa (1357-1419). The Geluk tradi-tion was rooted in the Kadam (Words of the Buddha as Personal Instructions) tradition,which began with Atisha (982-1054) and his renowned student Dromtönpa (’Bromston pa) (1004-1064). The main practices of these lineages are based on the tantrastranslated after the beginning of the eleventh century and during the later spread ofBuddhism in Tibet. The pioneer of these translations was Rinchen Zangpo (Rin chenbzang po) (958-1051).The ancient tradition of secret mantra (snga ’gyur rnying ma’i lugs) originated withthe early translations of tantras, inspired by the mystic activity of the Indian masterPadmasambhava in the ninth century. The tantric texts translated from Sanskrit prior tothe end of the tenth century and during the early spread of Buddhism in Tibet areknown as the tantras of the early translation (gsang sngags snga ’gyur)."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"374\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA2. The three collections of Buddhist teachings (sde snod gsum, tripiîaka): the collectionon discipline (’dul ba, vinaya); collection of discourses (mdo, sátra); and the collectionon phenomenology (mngon pa, abhidharma). These set forth the trainings (bslab pa,Ÿikø›) in ethics (tshul khrims, Ÿ¦la); contemplation (ting nge ’dzin, sam›dhi); and wisdom(shes rab, prajñ›), respectively.3. This assertion is held by the Sakya school. See Sönam Tsemo’s General Presentation ofthe Sets of Tantra (hereafter cited as SGP), ff. 25b6-27a3.4. Rangjung Dorjé (Rang byung rdo rje), the Third Karmapa (1284-1339), became thereceptacle for countless exoteric and esoteric teachings, those of the ancient tradition inparticular. His education was overseen by the great adept Orgyenpa Rinchen Pal (Urgyan pa rin chen dpal). Rangjung Dorjé’s life was filled with miracles, mystic visions,and experiences in meditation. Inspired by a vision revealing the nature of inner andouter reality, he composed his masterpiece, the Profound Inner Reality, along with itsautocommentary. While travelling throughout the various regions of Tibet, he propa-gated the teachings extensively and wrote texts on a number of subjects, including as-trology. In 1332, he was invited to China where he conferred the initiation of Kalachakraupon the court. When he returned to Tibet, he retired to the caves above Samyé Monas-tery. From there, he oversaw the preparation of a set of the entire Buddhist Canon (bKa’’gyur) and its treatises (bsTan ’gyur). During the consecration ceremonies, he had severalvisions of bodhisattvas reciting the scriptures. He was invited once more to China wherehe passed away in 1339 at the age of fifty-six. Following his death, he was seen by hisdisciples sitting on a moon mandala. See The Blue Annals (hereafter cited as BA), pp.487-539.5. Awareness-holder (rig pa ’dzin pa, vidy›dhara) refers to the tantric adept. “Awareness”(rig pa, vidy›) denotes the pristine awareness of immutable supreme bliss which is pri-mordially present as the ground, or nature, of being. To become a “holder” (’dzin pa)means to reawaken such pristine awareness (in the sense of becoming aware of it again)by means of special tantric techniques. See Kongtrul’s Infinite Ocean of Knowledge (here-after cited as IOK), vol. II, pp. 135-136.The collection of teachings of the awareness-holders refers to the collection of teach-ings comprising the indestructible way.6. Rangjung Dorjé discusses this particular point in his Profound Inner Reality (ff. 30a4-31a1). See Kongtrul’s Commentary on the Profound Inner Reality (hereafter cited as CPR),ff. 179a4-182a6.7. Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra (Toh. 3713), vol. Tsu, f. 106a4.Shraddhakaravarman (õraddh›karavarman) (Dad byed go cha) is noted as a discipleof Shantipa in the lineage of transmission of the Guhyasamaja tantra of the Jnanapadatradition (BA, p. 373) and also appears in the lineage of transmission of rituals associ-ated with the deity Tara (BA, p. 1051). Shraddhakaravarman is rarely mentioned inhistories of the propagation of Buddhism in India and Tibet. His name, however, isassociated with nearly sixty works in the Tibetan-language Buddhist Canon and trea-tises, in most cases as translator. One must therefore assume that this outstanding scholarand accomplished master from Kashmir made a substantial contribution to the secondpropagation of Buddhist teachings in Tibet. He was invited by King Yeshé Öd (Ye shes"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"’od) of Gugé in western Tibet to restore the purity of Buddhist teachings and practice,which the king considered to have degenerated in various ways. Butön remarks thatShraddhakaravarman was particularly knowledgeable of yoga tantra, many scriptures ofwhich he translated. As well, he appears in the lineages of different tantras such asGuhyasamaja and the cycle of teachings on Tara. He became the master and close asso-ciate of the great translator Rinchen Zangpo with whom he collaborated on variousimportant translations. See Butön’s Survey of Yoga Tantra.8. Nine branches of the Buddha’s words (gsung rab yan lag dgu, nav›ºga pravacana):discourses (mdo sde, sátra), aphorisms in prose or verse (dbyangs kyis bsnyad pa, geya),prophetic declarations (lung du bstan pa, vy›karaòa), verses (tshig su bcad pa, g›th›),meaningful or purposeful expressions (ched du brjod pa, ud›na), legends (gleng gzhi,nid›na), far-ranging teachings (rgyas pa, vaipulya), stories of the previous lives of theBuddha (skyes rabs, j›taka), and marvellous events (rmad du byung ba, abdhutadharma).For a discussion of these, see IOK, vol. I, pp. 348-350.9. Dialogue with Subahu Tantra (Toh. 805), vol. Wa, f. 136a4.10. Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra (Toh. 3713) vol. Tsu, f. 106a3.Shraddhakaravarman explains the placement of the indestructible way in two ways: one inwhich it is included in the three collections and one in which it is a fourth scriptural division.11. The verse cited by Shraddhakaravarman is among the standard phrases recited dur-ing initiations of the higher tantras in order to assume tantric vows. Here, “outer way”refers to that of the proclaimers; “inner way,” that of the bodhisattvas; and “secret way,”that of mantric practitioners.12. Extensive Commentary on the Vajravidarana Tantra (Toh. 2680), vol. Thu, f. 176b2.Buddhaguhya (Sangs rgyas gsang ba): disciple of the great master Buddhajnanapadaand contemporary of Padmasambhava, Shantirakshita, and the Tibetan King TrisongDe’utsen (Khri srong lde’u btsan) (790-844). He is generally considered to have been anadept and propagator of the action, conduct, and yoga tantras only. See Taranata’s His-tory of Buddhism in India (hereafter cited as HBI), pp. 276; 280-281. Nyingmapa schol-ars consider this same person to be the author of works on the Secret Essence (gSang ba’isnying po) and its path and thus an expert on mahayoga and anuyoga tantras. See DudjomRinpoché’s The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History (here-after cited as NSH), pp. 465-466; 534. It is more likely, however, that these are twodifferent persons.13. Way of characteristics (mtshan nyid kyi theg pa), also known as the causal way ofcharacteristics (rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa), denotes the sutra way as opposed to that ofmantra. It includes the ways of the proclaimers and the solitary sages, which are basedon the analyst (vaibh›ýika) and traditionist (sautr›ntika) philosophical systems, and theway of the bodhisattvas, which is based on the idealist (cittam›tra) and centrist(m›dhyamika) systems.It is known as “characteristics” because it points to the path of secret mantra and itsbranches leading directly to the final result (the state of union of Vajradhara). It is knownas “causal” (rgyu) because it serves as only half of the cause of the pristine awareness ofthe state of union of non-abiding perfect peace, the final result (IOK, vol. II, p. 491).For an extensive discussion, see IOK, vol. II, pp. 442-560.NOTES TO PAGES 72 TO 74\u0002375"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"376\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA14.

Twelve branches of the Buddha’s words (gsung rab yan lag bcu gnyis): the nine branchesmentioned above (n. 8), plus narratives (rtogs pa brjod pa, avad›na), parables (de lta bubyung ba, nivættaka), and established instructions (gtan phab, upadeŸa).16. Seventy Verses on the Triple Refuge (Toh. 3971), vol. Gi, f. 253a2.Chandrakirti (Candrak¦rti) (Zla ba grags pa) was born in Samanta, south India, inthe sixth century. Studying under Buddhapalita’s disciple Kamalabuddhi as well as dis-ciples of Bhavaviveka, he gained knowledge of the entire Buddhist doctrine. Later, hemoved to Nalanda Monastery in central India where he became the abbot and foremostmaster among its scholars. He was an elucidator of Nagarjuna’s thought and an eminentteacher of centrist philosophy. He is said to have received directly from Manjushri vari-ous powers such as the ability to move freely through walls and the eloquence to defeatnumberless philosophers holding opposing views. His Lucid Exposition: A Commentaryon Nagarjuna’s Fundamental Verses Called Wisdom (Toh. 3860) and Illuminating Lamp(Toh. 1785), a commentary on the Five Stages, a tantric work by Nagarjuna, are com-pared to the sun and the moon by virtue of their capacity to elucidate the sutras and thetantras. At the end of his life, Chandrakirti returned to southern India where he propa-gated the teachings extensively, after which he remained in seclusion, dedicating himselfto the practice of the secret mantra system. See Taranata’s HBI, pp. 198-199.17. Seventy Verses on the Triple Refuge (Toh. 3971), vol. Gi, f. 253a2-3.18. Reading rig ’dzin for rig ces.19. The thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening (byang chub kyi phyogs sum cu rtsabdun) consist of the four applications of mindfulness (dran pa nyer gzhag bzhi): modesof discriminative wisdom applied to understanding the emptiness of body (lus), feelings(tshor ba), mental processes (sems), and mental contents (chos); the four perfect aban-donments (yang dag spong ba bzhi): to renounce all that is unwholesome in oneself; toprevent all that is unwholesome from arising in oneself; to strengthen the virtuous quali-ties already present; and to develop virtuous qualities not yet developed; the four basesfor miracles (rdzu ’phrul rkang pa bzhi): concentrations distinguished by will, persever-ance, intention, and analysis; the five powers (dbang po lnga): confidence, effort, mind-fulness, concentration, and wisdom (these mark the preparatory stages that lead to thedirect knowledge of reality); the five strengths (stobs lnga): similar to the five powers butdiffering in that they can never be destroyed by adverse circumstances (these are per-fected during the last two of the four levels of the path of preparation—heat, summit,acceptance, and highest qualities—and mark the climax stage prior to the direct knowl-edge of reality); the seven factors conducive to awakening (byang chub yan lag bdun):mindfulness, investigation of the nature of things, effort, joy, psychophysical refine-ment, concentration, and equanimity (these mark the actual vision of reality); theeightfold exalted path (’phags lam yan lag brgyad): the right way of seeing; the rightway of expressing that vision in thoughts; and in words; the right way of exertingoneself in that vision; the right livelihood; the right mindfulness in attending thatvision; the right concentration on the vision; and the right way of expressing thevision in actions."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"20. Emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects (rnam pa thams cad kyi mchogdang ldan pa’i stong pa nyid). According to the Kalachakra tantra, this emptiness alone iscapable of producing supreme immutable bliss (’gyur ba med pa’i bde ba chen po), theultimate result. Its nature is like that of the images in a divination mirror: it has all theaspects (rnam pa thams cad pa) of the three realms of existence, while its own naturelacks real characteristics in not being composed of particles and being free from concep-tual constructs. It is direct knowledge. It is the illusory manifestation of the supreme(mchog) pristine awareness of luminous clarity. See IOK, vol. III, pp. 213-218.Kedrup Norzang Gyatso explains that such emptiness denotes the great seal itself(phyag rgya chen mo) (actualized as the female deity of Kalachakra in union in the “sub-sequent application” branch of the sixfold yoga), the perfection of wisdom, the motherof all buddhas, endowed with the supreme of all aspects and characterized by beingdevoid of intrinsic existence. This seal is also referred to by the term dharmodaya (chos’byung), the source of all phenomena, which lack inherent nature. Here, “phenomena,which lack inherent nature” refers to all of the 84,000 aspects of reality, exemplified bythe ten powers, fearlessness, and so forth (Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra,p. 308a5-7).In Kongtrul’s view, such emptiness corresponds to emptiness as understood in theway of the perfections, not merely as negation of the true existence of phenomena, butas luminous clarity endowed with all of the qualities of awakening. See also Chapter 10,n. 14.21. Awareness mantra (rig sngags, vidy›mantra): a general name for the three types ofmantra, which are secret mantra (gsang sngags, guhyamantra), awareness mantra, andretention mantra (gzungs sngags, dh›raò¦mantra). Jnanashri writes that secret mantrarefers to the indivisible union of wisdom and method; awareness mantra, to wisdom andpristine awareness; and retention mantra, to wisdom and retention. Secret mantra alsorefers to the male deities; awareness mantra, to the female deities; and retention mantra,to both male and female deities. One mantra can also be understood as including allthree mantra types, and one deity, as including all three types of deities. There are othersystems of classification of these three types of mantra. See Dispelling the Two Extremes inthe Indestructible Way (Toh. 3714), vol. Tsu, f. 117b6-7.Secret mantra is so called because it must be kept hidden from unsuitable persons;awareness mantra is so called because it overcomes delusion caused by attachment andother emotional afflictions incompatible with awareness; and retention mantra is socalled because it enables one to maintain inner qualities (Zhuchen Tsultrim Rinchen’sCatalogue of the Tengyur [bsTan ’gyur dkar chag], p. 194).22. Tantra application (rgyud kyi sbyor ba). See Chapter 14.23. Secretive yakshas (gsang ba pa, guhyaka): semi-divine beings said to live in turretslocated at the four corners of the top of Mount Meru.24. There are three types of mundane awareness-holders: the lesser awareness-holder ofeight powers (dngos grub brgyad kyi rig ’dzin chung ba); the middling awareness-holder ofthe desire realm (’bring ’dod pa’i rig ’dzin); and the great awareness-holder of the desireand form realms (chen po ’dod pa dang gzugs kyi rig ’dzin). The lesser type, considered tobe one of the lesser powers, is able to fly, and so on, and can successfully perform theNOTES TO PAGES 74 TO 77\u0002377"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"378\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAappeasing and dominating forms of activation, and so forth. The middling type, consid-ered as a middling power, is gained by yogins on the greater path of accumulation. Thepower consists in having a body equal in qualities to that of a desire realm god in itscapacity to use awareness mantras, perform miraculous feats, and extend life span. It isalso known as the awareness-holder with a body possessing eight qualities of lordliness:lightness (phra ba), subtleness, (yang ba), mastery (bdag por gyur ba), freedom of move-ment (gar yang phyin pa), luminosity (rab tu gsal ba), wish-granting power (’dod dgursgyur ba), stability (de nyid brten pa), and influence (dbang du gyur ba).The great awareness-holder is of two types: that of the desire realm and that of theform realm. The awareness-holder of the desire realm, considered to be a great power, isgained by a yogin close to attainment or dwelling on the first stage of awakening. Thepower in this case is the ability to travel to buddha realms and to hear teachings from themanifest dimension of awakening. The great awareness-holder of the form realm, alsoconsidered to be the status of great power, is possessed of a body equal to that of a god ofthe heavens called “pure abodes” up to the realm of Unsurpassed, endowed with theeight qualities of lordliness in a very subtle form. For an extensive discussion, see IOK,vol. III, pp. 629-640.25. Support for the mind (sems kyi rten).26. The first two of the five paths (lam lnga) (accumulation, preparation, seeing, medi-tation, and no more training) which mark the steps in both the individualist and univer-salist ways to awakening. The path of accumulation (tshogs lam) and path of preparation(sbyor lam) are the stages at which the understanding of reality is conceptually cultivatedthrough study and reflection. The path of seeing (mthong lam) denotes the point atwhich direct insight of emptiness is gained. The ensuing path of meditation (bsgomslam) is the stage at which one repeatedly enters contemplation on emptiness in order toremove the obscurations that prevent the arising of universal knowledge on the path ofno more training (mi slob pa’i lam). In this context, these are not common paths buttantric paths. For an extensive discussion, see IOK, vol. III, pp. 464-533.27. Dynamic perfect peace (mi gnas pa’i myang ’das): the state of awakening that, throughthe strength of realization of the true nature, neither dwells within the limit of cyclicexistence nor passes beyond it, and through great compassion, passes beyond the limit ofperfect peace.28. Treatise on Valid Cognition (Toh. 4210), vol. Ce, f. 121b4.Dharmakirti (Dharmak¦rti) (Chos kyi grags pa) was born to Hindu parents inTrimalaya in South India. At an early age, he was acclaimed as a master of the Vedas andthe various non-Buddhist philosophies of the time. Upon reading certain Buddhist scrip-tures, he instantly appreciated the significance of the teachings, as a consequence ofwhich he resolved to become a monk. During his monastic training, he readily sur-passed his teacher in knowledge of logic. It was the master Dingipa who introduced himto the system of secret mantra. Dharmakirti received the power of invincibility in debatethrough a vision of Heruka. Although already incomparably erudite, he continued hisstudies under the brahmin Kumaralila in order to be able to refute the secret Hinduphilosophies. After he had gained an understanding of those systems, he offered thegreedy brahmin silver and gold and bade him farewell. Following that, he became fa-"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"mous as a peerless debater, as a result of which he converted countless Hindu philoso-phers (including Kumaralila) and their followers to the Buddhist teachings. See HBI,pp. 228-240.29. This line from the Treatise on Valid Cognition concerns the inference that throughthe reason of the presence of smoke, one ascertains the presence of fire. Such inferencedirectly arises on the basis of the mind that apprehends the presence of smoke as thereason. Since fire (i.e., a phenomenon) does not actually appear to that inference, it isnot related directly. However, such inference correctly deduces fire (or its presence);thus, the inference and fire are indirectly related. Similarly, although practitioners of theway of mantra are of sharp faculties, all other beings, as their faculties become sharperwith training, may become candidates for secret mantra in the course of time. Thus,indirectly, all beings are possible candidates for secret mantra practice.30. Lamp of the Three Modes (Toh. 3707), vol. Tsu, f. 16b3-4.31. The way of the perfections and that of mantra do not differ with respect to the viewto be understood, the result to be attained, and the altruistic awakening mind as motiva-tion. Nevertheless, mantra is superior by virtue of four features. The first is being clearwith respect to the view: In the way of the perfections, at the stage of an ordinary indi-vidual, however much the practitioner ascertains the ineffable view through examplesand reasons, understanding will be only conceptual. For a practitioner of mantra, pris-tine awareness is elicited in his or her mind at the time of the initiation through theprofound crucial point of the dependent connection of the initiation’s content, mantra,and contemplation (when the pristine awareness deity descends upon the student or atthe time of the third initiation, and so forth). This is ineffable pristine awareness, whichis an actual understanding arising by way of example and through the secret instructionsof the master. Relying on that pristine awareness, actual pristine awareness can be swiftlybrought forth. Source: Zhuchen Tsultrim Rinchen’s Catalogue of the Tengyur, p. 199.The second, abundant in methods, the means of realization, is explained as follows:In the way of mantra, the methods used to attain common powers and the supremepower of awakening are plentiful. Common powers, from invisibility and clairvoyanceup to possession of magnificent wealth, outstanding discriminative wisdom, and longlife, are gained slowly in the way of the perfections through generosity and the otherperfections. The mantric practitioner can easily attain such common powers throughinnumerable “methods of attainment” (sgrub thabs, s›dhana), such as that of Manjushri,Vasudhara, and so forth. These common powers also contribute to his or her awakening.The secret mantra way also incorporates a vast range of methods aimed at the supremepower (awakening) related to profound reality. For example, by cultivating the phase ofgeneration of a deity with sixteen hands, one gains understanding of the sixteenemptinesses, while in the sutra system, one is able to gain mere knowledge of the statethat transcends concepts. In addition, with exceptional techniques such as the practiceof inner heat, the way of mantra produces states of non-conceptual contemplation. As tothe means of attainment related to relative reality, secret mantra presents the methodsfor the creation of buddha realms and extensive forms of practice. For these reasons,mantra’s methods are superior. Source: SGP, ff. 17b3-18a4.The third, being devoid of hardships, is explained as follows: In the way of the per-fections, awakening is achieved only with great difficulty in following a path that in-NOTES TO PAGES 77 TO 79\u0002379"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"380\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAvolves undergoing hardships and austerities for three inestimably long aeons. Such hard-ships include giving up everything, from the top of one’s head to the soles of the feet.Conversely, secret mantra is a path whereby awakening is gained through comparativelyeasy practices. Accordingly, the Guhyasamaja Tantra states:Enlightenment will not be achievedAs the result of endless austerities and vows.While freely enjoyingThe pleasures of the senses,With the yoga of one’s deityOne offers them to oneself and others.The master Vajrapani states:Moreover, “without hardships” means using great bliss as the path.Source: Zhuchen Tsultrim Rinchen’s Catalogue of the Tengyur, p. 200.The fourth, intended for persons of sharp faculties since attainment is swift, is ex-plained by Sönam Tsemo: In the way of the perfections, to awaken, even with the ut-most effort, requires three inestimably long aeons. In the indestructible way, persons ofsharp faculties can become accomplished within one lifetime; those of average faculties,in the period between this life and the next; and those of inferior faculties, in seven orsixteen lifetimes (SGP, f. 18a3-5).For Tripitakamala’s own explanation of these four features, see Tsongkapa’s Tantra inTibet (English translation), pp. 145-149. See also Butön’s General Presentation of the Setsof Tantra (henceforth cited as BGP), ff. 3b2-6a5.32. Dispelling the Two Extremes in the Indestructible Way (Toh. 3714), vol. Tsu, ff. 115b6-116a1.Jnanashri (Jñ›naŸr¦) (Ye shes dpal) was a teacher of Atisha and one of the six “gate-keeper” scholars of the great monastic institution of Vikramashila at the time of KingDharmapala. Initially, he was a scholar of the proclaimers’ way, but later his interest inthe universal way and secret mantra way grew, and he became proficient in these. Hehad repeated visions of the Buddha, Maitreya, and Avalokiteshvara. See HBI, pp. 295;302-303.33. Concerning methods that “rely on unsurpassable scriptures” (literally, “focus”) (dmigspa bla na med pa la dmigs pa’i thabs), Jnanashri’s Dispelling the Two Extremes in the Inde-structible Way (f. 116a1-3) states that in the path of the perfections, the focus is on thePerfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Stanzas, the Flower Array Scripture, andso forth. In the path of mantra, these scriptures are not relied upon, but instead, thefocus is on exceptional scriptures such as the Hevajra Tantra in Five Hundred ThousandStanzas, Glorious Yamari Tantra in Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Stanzas, GloriousKhasamana Tantra in One Hundred Thousand Stanzas, and so forth.On the “unsurpassable practice” (sgrub pa bla na med pa), Jnanashri states that inthe way of the perfections, having gained the capacity for physical manifestations, oneis able to effect the welfare of others in a hidden way. Likewise, in this path of mantra,even without gaining the capacity for physical manifestations, the practitioner achievestypes of contemplations and physical manifestations unknown in the way of the per-"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"fections, thereby becoming able to effect the welfare of beings in a hidden way (f.116a3).Concerning “unsurpassable pristine awareness” (ye shes bla na med pa), Jnanashri statesthat, on the basis of a special contemplation that settles the mind, pristine awareness mayswiftly arise through causes, spontaneously, and through pure actions (f. 116a3-4).On “unsurpassable diligence” (brtson ’grus bla na med pa), he notes that because ofthe purity of the pledges one has assumed, the practitioner’s majestic diligence is exhib-ited unconditionally (f. 116a5-6).On the “power to uplift all of one’s followers” (gdul bya ma lus pa rjes su ’dzin par nuspa), he explains that trainees from bad lineages such as butchers, and even murderers,and so on, who are rejected from the practice of other spiritual ways, here in the mantrasystem are accepted and declared that they will become accomplished. Therefore, man-tra has the power to uplift all followers (f. 116a4-5).“To bless or transform emotional afflictions” (nyon mongs pa byin gyis rlobs pa) meansthat through the bliss of the completion phase and by viewing afflictions as having thenature of an offering to the deities, emotional afflictions are transformed (f. 116a6).“To overcome emotional afflictions” (nyon mongs pa spong ba) means that by trans-forming all phenomena into special divine appearances and through the pledge relatingto the shape and color of the deity, one is spontaneously released from emotional afflic-tions (f. 116a5-6).On “to swiftly impart blessing” (byin gyis brlab pa myur ba), Jnanashri comments:Unlike the path of the perfections, which states:The blessing of the transcendent onesIs received once one has entered the path,the mantra way uses skillful methods to channel into the trainee the blessings of all thetranscendent ones right from the beginning (f. 116a6-7).“To swiftly attain liberation” (myur du ’byung ba) is explained in this way: Owing tomethods that distinguish it from the former path, in tantra, in a very short time (sixteenor seven lifetimes, or in a single lifetime), the trainee becomes released from cyclic exist-ence and thus liberation is swift (f. 116a7).Concerning “unsurpassable disposition” (bsams pa bla na med pa), Jnanashri statesthat disposition refers to the vajra yogas of awakened body, speech, and mind. By meansof the yoga of awakened body, four qualities are accrued: the habitual tendencies forordinary conceptual constructs are quickly removed; the ripening results of past actionsare swiftly averted; an abundance of merit is acquired; and the selfless nature of phe-nomena is spontaneously understood (f. 116b2-3). The yoga of awakened speech yieldstwelve qualities: the ability to reveal the sacred words of the victorious ones; recollect thepower of mantra teachings and thereby develop faith in them; accomplish the words oftruth of the secret mantra; attain the wisdom of skillful methods (the power of secretmantras), pristine awareness (the power of awareness mantras), and retention (the powerof retention mantras); achieve undivided contemplation; venerate the exalted ones; ef-fect the welfare of others; swiftly reach the stages of familiarization and attainment of thedeity; gain mastery over phenomena as the magical play of letters; understand that allsounds are like an echo; and directly know the selfless nature of phenomena (f. 117a1-4). The yoga of awakened mind gives rise to all qualities: At all times and in everyNOTES TO PAGES 79 TO 80\u0002381"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"382\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAcircumstance, phenomena are seen as an illusion, and therefore emotional afflictions areforsaken without difficulty. Free of any pride in virtue, the yogin acquires all that iswonderful in this world and beyond it (ff. 117b7-118a1).As to the “unsurpassable conduct” (spyod pa bla na med pa), Jnanashri notes thatunsurpassable conduct prohibits three unsuitable practices: The first involves conductthat weakens one’s energy, such as unbearable asceticism and restraints that do not leadto accomplishment. Instead, one relies on sources of pleasure and thereby becomes spiri-tually accomplished (f. 118b1-2). Second is distracting conduct such as reading scrip-tures, circumambulating reliquaries, and other physical and verbal activities. Instead,one focuses on inner practices, the contemplation of reality alone, and so forth (f. 118b4-5). Third is the conduct based on adherence to limiting concepts of what is clean andwhat unclean. Instead, one consumes the five meats (of horse, ox, dog, elephant, andhuman) and five nectars (of semen, blood, feces, urine, and human flesh) by initiallycontemplating their emptiness and then transforming them into divine nectars (f. 119a4-7).34. Indrabhuti’s opinion is recorded in Ashvaghosha’s Summation of Pledges (Toh. 3725),vol. Tshu, f. 44a6-7. Reference to the name of the work of Indrabhuti from which thecitation is drawn is not provided.The name Indrabhuti is associated with the “Land of Oddiyana,” which is identifiedby some scholars as the Swat Valley region of northern Pakistan. Different persons arereferred to by this name. The first, or “Great,” Indrabhuti (BA, p. 359) was the King ofOddiyana who requested the Buddha to expound the Guhyasamaja tantra. He is alsoknown as King Dza and considered to be the first tantric adept and an emanation ofVajrapani. The reference here is likely to the “middle” Indrabhuti (HBI, p. 241), discipleof the great adept Kambala, whose story is recounted in Abhayadatta’s Life of the Eighty-f our Great Siddhas. A third Indrabhuti is spoken of, but his identification is uncertain.35. Buddhajnanapada’s statement is recorded in Ashvaghosha’s Summation of Pledges(Toh. 3725), vol. Tshu, f. 44a7. Reference to the name of the work of Buddhajnanapada(Jñ›napada) from which the citation is drawn is not provided.Buddhajnanapada, the foremost disciple of Haribhadra, was the master who conse-crated Vikramashila Monastery. Endowed with miraculous powers, he would receivewealth from the deity Jambala in the night to be spent the following day in pious acts,such as supporting monks. He widely expounded the highest yoga tantra system and, inparticular, the Guhyasamaja tantra (HBI, pp. 278-280).36. Presentation of the Three Ways (Toh. 3712), vol. Tsu, f. 101b4-7.Shantipa (Ratnakarashanti), a disciple of Naropa, is counted as one of the six gate-keepers of Vikramashila Monastery. Once, while on a teaching mission in Sri Lanka, hegave oral instructions to a modest farmer named Kotali. Later, during a meditationretreat, Shantipa received a visit from Kotali, who by that time had attained the fullestrealization owing to his practice of Shantipa’s instructions. Shantipa, who had not yetattained realization himself, requested from Kotali the same instructions he had givenhim, and in twelve years, Shantipa also awakened.37.

He began his quest as a yogin, then became a monk,and subsequently became famous as the greatest scholar and most saintly person of histime, revered by both the individualist and universalist monastic communities. Uponreceiving a prophecy from Tara and an invitation from a Tibetan king, despite the factthat his life would be shortened, he decided to travel to Tibet in 1042 to propagate theteachings of Buddhism. There he taught extensively and died in 1054 without returningto India. His contribution to the later development of Buddhism in Tibet is felt up tothe present day. For the life of Atisha, see Alaka Chattopadhyaya’s study, At¦Ÿa and Tibet(Calcutta, 1967).39. Nagarjuna (N›g›rjuna) (Klu sgrub) was born in southern India in a brahmin familyand became the pioneer of the centrist system of philosophy and one of the foremostproponents of the universal way. He is said to have been called Nagarjuna (meaning“one who has achieved his goal with the aid of nagas”) because nagas presented him withthe large Transcendent Wisdom Scripture and other scriptures that were hidden in theirworld. Nagarjuna wrote the Five Stages, the Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja, andother works, which served as bases for commentaries composed by later scholars and siddhas.40. The dimension of reality is one of the three bodies or dimensions of awakening (skugsum, trik›ya): the reality dimension (chos sku, dharmak›ya), enjoyment dimension (longsspyod rdzogs pa’i sku, sambhogak›ya), and manifest dimension of awakening (sprul pa’isku, nirm›òak›ya), which represent awakened mind, speech, and visible embodiment,respectively. A fourth, the essential dimension (ngo bo nyid kyi sku, svabh›vikak›ya), isconsidered to be the essence of all three. In his General Meaning of the Hevajra Tantra,Kongtrul defines them in terms of the purity of different aspects of consciousness. Theconsciousness that perceives objects (’jug pa’i rnam shes), when purified through thephase of generation, is the manifest dimension, which accomplishes the welfare of oth-ers through various means. The subjective mind (yid), which exists in relation to theground-of-all (kun gzhi, ›laya) as an illusory factor to be relinquished, when purified bybliss, is the enjoyment dimension, which enjoys the doctrine of the universal way. Theground-of-all purified of adventitious stains is the reality dimension. The indivisibilityof these three is the essential dimension (General Meaning of the Hevajra Tantra, hereaf-ter cited as MH, f. 37b1-3).41. See Ashvaghosha’s Summation of Pledges (Toh 3725), vol.

Enhancing activi-ties include the complex, unelaborate, and simple tantric conducts, the feast offering,and the auxiliary wrathful ritual (drag shul gyi sbyor ba) to elicit results (spogs chog). Theauxiliary ritual is known as “threatening” (sdigs sbyor) or “striking with the dagger” (phurbus gdab pa), or the ritual of killing the deity (lha bsad pa’i sbyor ba). This ritual compelsthe deity to bestow powers by striking the dagger at vital points of its form. (For anextensive discussion, see IOK, vol. III, pp. 533-566.) There are as well specific methodsto elicit desired results, such as recitation of the deity’s mantra in the reverse order, orremaining for an extended period in total darkness. This latter technique is used whenone is engaged in the illusory body practice while contemplating phenomena as dreamimages. If one’s adherence to the concreteness of phenomena remains fixed and thedreamlike nature not realized, the “dark retreat” is beneficial since the various visionsexperienced in the conditions of the retreat are more easily understood to lack reality,and the goal of one’s endeavors more easily fulfilled (oral teaching of Bokar Rinpoché).44. According to the secret mantra system, by following the perfections, a practitionermay be able to reach the tenth stage of awakening, but in order to become fully awak-ened, he or she must enter the mantra path. Thus, the way of the perfections leads to fullawakening only indirectly. At the tenth stage, or prior to that when still on the path oftraining (slob pa’i lam), a practitioner must enter the tantric path, which involves thetraining of mantra, in order to attain awakening, or the path of no more training (mislob pa’i lam) which leads to the final result of awakening.45. Union beyond training (mi slob pa’i zung ’jug): the union of the actual luminousclarity and the pure (i.e., free from emotional afflictions and obscurations) illusory body;or union of the manifest dimension of awakening and the reality dimension. The char-acteristics of this union are summarized by Kongtrul as a total union exemplifying high-est freedom and realization. Freedom refers to the knowledge that obscurations andtheir predispositions are already exhausted primordially. Realization refers to the knowl-edge that understands without examination all phenomena of cyclic existence and per-fect peace, such as the ground, the path, and so forth, to be like the images in a mirrordivination.

The six fortunes, which encompass all awakened qualities, are knownas bhaga; an awakened one, who possesses them, is known as bhagawan. Qualities con-cordant with the six fortunes of a buddha also exist in bodhisattvas. Lordliness refers tothe ten powers of a buddha; beauty, to the major and minor marks of a buddha’s body;wealth, to the buddha realm replete with infinite enjoyments; renown, to praise, since abuddha is worthy of the veneration of all beings; pristine awareness, to the eighteenexclusive qualities of a buddha; and diligence, to the spontaneous, fortuitous, andunmistaken altruistic activities of a buddha which are not based on conceptual motiva-tion.

As for the path (lam), in the outertantra, a similitude of liberation is taken as the path, and the deity is generated accordingto the manner of awakening; in the inner tantra, a similitude of conditioned existence istaken as the path, and the deity is generated in a way as to purify the four modes of birth.In outer tantra, the essential principle (de kho na nyid) of the deity is revealed as the fivepristine awarenesses, while in inner tantra, the ordinary aggregates, the five meats, thefive nectars, and so forth, are revealed as the five pristine awarenesses.

Thus, in highest yoga tantra, the four tantras are alsoknown by the names “tantra of gazing,” “tantra of laughing,” “tantra of holding hands,”and “tantra of sexual union.”10.

Ordinary powers (thun mong gi dngos grub), “ordinary” as opposed to the supreme“power” of awakening (mchog gi dngos grub), are classified as lesser, middling, and great.The lesser include eight powers (dngos grub brgyad) and various activations (see Chapter1, n. 57). The middling powers consist of those of an awareness-holder of the desirerealm endowed with the eight physical qualities of lordliness. The great powers consistof the powers of a supreme awareness-holder of the desire realm and an awareness-holder of the form realm equally endowed as the gods of that realm (see Chapter 1, n.24). The supreme power is twofold: provisional and definitive. The former consists ofthe dimension of union (zung ’jug gi sku) of the exalted level of a bodhisattva attainedthrough the mantric path; the latter, the state of a perfect buddha.

According to Atisha (Commentary on the Lamp for the Path, vol. Khi, f. 287b2), thereare six thousand tantras in the division of tantra of both (gnyis ka’i rgyud, ubhayatantra),examples of which are the Net of Magical Manifestation (M›y›j›la, sGyu ’phrul drva ba,Toh. 466) (a tantra of the yoga tantra class), and the Lord of the Lotus Dancers(*PadmanarteŸvara, Padma gar gyi dbang phyug). This last tantra does not seem to be partof the Kangyur; the Tengyur, however, contains six sadhanas for Padmanarteshvara, in-cluding one whose author is Kukuraja (Toh. 1667).21. For a list of tantras belonging to these classes, see Atisha’s Commentary on the Lampfor the Path (Toh. 3948, vol. Khi, f. 287b2-7); see also Taranata’s Origin of the KalachakraTeachings, Collected Works, vol. 2, ff. 3b5-4a6.22. This rationale for the fourfold classification of the tantras is refuted by Tsongkapa(see Tantra in Tibet, in English, pp. 153-154) but accepted by other masters such asSakyapa Sönam Tsemo (see SGP, ff. 27a4-30b4) and Kongtrul. Sönam Tsemo specifiesthat the four groups of non-Buddhists are followers of the Vedas and that their peculiar“religious” observances are related to their predominant afflictions. He points out theway the four tantras accommodate and inspire these four groups.He adds that the first chapter of the Summation of Essential Principles (Toh. 479)(vol. Nya, ff. 1-142), called Indestructible Dimension, presents deities with passionateaspects in order to accommodate beings whose strongest emotional affliction is desire;the second chapter, called Victory Over the Three Worlds, presents deities with wrathfulaspects to accommodate those whose strongest affliction is aversion; the third chapter,called Training Beings, presents deities in their peaceful aspects to accommodate thosewhose strongest affliction is delusion; and the fourth chapter, called Accomplishing AllAims, presents deities varying in color and aspects to accommodate those of uncertainemotional patterns (f. 30a5-b3).Subhutipalita is said to be one of the masters of Anandagarbha (HBI, p.285).

The assertion that the fourfold division of tantra is made in consideration of the fourtrends of Buddhist philosophy (siddhanta) is made by Smriti (Smæti) in his commentarycalled Vajra-vid›raò›-n›ma-dh›raò¦-vætti. Sönam Tsemo ascribes this assertion toNagarjuna and Aryadeva and states that it is based on the Compendium on the Indestruc-tible Pristine Awareness Tantra (Toh. 447). One might have the impression that action,conduct, yoga, and highest yoga tantra would be correlated, respectively, with the ana-lyst (vaibh›øika), traditionist (sautr›ntika), idealist (cittam›tra), and centrist (m›dhyamika)philosophical trends (as asserted by Butön in BGP, f. 45a7-b4). However, Sönam Tsemostates that action tantra was taught in order to accommodate the vatsiputriya (gnas mabu ba) and the aparantika (nyi ’og pa) (two of the eighteen original individualists’ schools)who adhered to the analysts’ philosophy; conduct tantra, to accommodate Kashmirianalysts and traditionists; yoga tantra, to accommodate solitary sages; and the highestyoga tantra, to accommodate idealists and centrists of the universal way.Sönam Tsemo correlates the four tantras’ different styles of deity yoga with the viewsof the aforementioned followers of the four philosophical trends. He states that theaction tantra’s style of deity yoga is taught for the vatsiputriya and aparantika, who be-lieve in the existence of a permanent and inexpressible self. Corresponding to their viewof an inexpressible self, in action tantra, the trainee meditates on a pristine awarenessdeity, which is neither the painting of the deity nor the meditator who is still in ordinaryform. Accordingly, the trainee arranges a painting of the deity, performs acts of venera-tion, such as offerings and ablutions, and then invokes and meditates on the pristineawareness deity with the attitude that this deity is like a king, and himself, the practitio-ner, a subject.Conduct tantra’s style of deity yoga is taught for the sake of Kashmiri analysts andtraditionists who, although denying the existence of a self, believe in the reality of subtleparticles (the object) and in partless moments of consciousness (the subject). Corre-sponding to their view, which asserts the reality of the apprehended and apprehender, inconduct tantra, one contemplates a twofold deity. Accordingly, one meditates on oneselfas the pledge deity and invokes and meditates on the pristine awareness deity in front.The relationship of oneself as the deity and the deity in front is like that of friends.Yoga tantra’s style of deity yoga is taught for solitary sages who do not accept thereality of subtle particles (the object) but do believe in the reality of moments of appre-hending consciousness. Corresponding to their view, in yoga tantra, the deities gener-ated are two on the relative level, but merge as one ultimately. Accordingly, one meditateson oneself as the pledge deity, and then one merges into the pristine awareness deity. Atthe end of the meditative session, the pristine awareness deity is requested to depart.Highest yoga tantra’s style of deity yoga is taught for idealists and centrists of theuniversal way who, although accepting in a relative sense a subject, deny it in an absolutesense. Corresponding to their view, in highest yoga tantra, one meditates on two deities,the pledge deity and the pristine awareness deity (the former then merged into the lat-ter), but no departure of the pristine awareness deity, even in between meditation ses-sions, is performed (SGP, f. 30b4-31b5).For a discussion of the four philosophical trends in Buddhism, see Jeffrey Hopkins’Meditation on Emptiness (hereafter cited as ME) (London: Wisdom Publications, 1983).28.

Commenting on the relevant lines of the Kalachakra Condensed Tantra, Butön statesthat the left face of Kalachakra taught action and conduct tantras for the sake of thosewho, influenced by the habitual tendencies of the state of sleep and the waking state,grasp external gross phenomena as real. The right face of Kalachakra taught the yogatantra for the sake of those who, influenced by the habitual tendencies of the dreamstate, cling to phenomena as being simply mind’s appearances. The central face ofKalachakra taught the mother tantra for the sake of those who, influenced by the ha-bitual tendencies of deep sleep (when all thoughts related to external objects cease), clingto the state of no thoughts. The anterior face of Kalachakra taught the tantra of themerchant class for the sake of those who, influenced by the habitual tendency for or-gasm, cling to pleasure (BGP, f. 20b4-7).30. In his Illumination of Secret Reality (f. 349b4-5), Krishnacharya states that tantra istaught in four sets in consideration of the four eras. For the era of completeness, actiontantra is taught; for the era of three quarters, conduct tantra; for the era of two quarters,yoga tantra; and for the era of turmoil, highest yoga tantra. See also BGP, f. 21a2-3. Onthe four eras, see chapter 3 of Kongtrul’s Myriad Worlds (English translation), sectionentitled “Different Ways of Explaining the Four Eras.”The division of tantra in accordance with the purity of the four periods of day andnight is set forth in Pundarika’s Stainless Light in this way: The first period represents thetantra of laughing; the third period, the tantra of looking; the fifth period, the tantra oftouching the breast of the consort; the seventh period, the tantra of holding hands.Hence, tantra has four divisions (BGP, f. 21a1-2).31.

Eight powers (dngos grub brgyad): the power of mantra (sngags) refers to the capacityto influence beings in both peaceful and forceful modes, by means of mantra. Medicine(sman) refers to the elixir of virility and longevity (bcud len). Fire offering (sbyin sreg) isthe power to perform the various forms of activation, (appeasing, enriching, and soforth) through fire rituals. Powders (phye ma) possibly refers to the power of the pill (rilbu) which, when placed in the mouth, enables the yogin to become invisible or assumeany form desired, or, alternatively, to the drop of substance (rdzas kyi thig le) applied tothe forehead that imparts the same power of invisibility. Eye-salve (smig sman) enables"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"one to see the three realms. Swiftness of foot (rkang mgyogs) enables one to travel greatdistances in short times. These are powers gained in dependence on “substances” or“objects.” If the yogin is separated from these substances, he loses the correspondingpower. These eight powers are presented in slightly different ways depending on thetantra. For an extensive discussion, see IOK, vol. III, pp. 629-640.3. As noted in Tsongkapa’s The Yoga of Tibet: The Exposition of Secret Mantra (Englishtranslation) (henceforth cited as YT) in the sections concerning action and conducttantra (pp. 9, 47), the words of the Compendium “to view with apprehension” (’jigs pardmigs) have been understood as “terrified of single-minded cultivation of deity yoga.”According to this interpretation, the apprehension that trainees of action tantra feel isrelated to viewing the body as divine. Such apprehension is born out of the conceptionthat one’s body is unclean, and thus it would not be appropriate to meditate on it as adeity.4. The pledge deity (lit. “pledge being”) (dam tshig sems dpa’, samayasattva) and thepristine awareness deity (ye shes sems dpa’, jñ›nasattva) are among the most importantprinciples in tantra. Later in this book, Kongtrul states that the pledge deity is generatedanew by the yogin, while the pristine awareness deity (invited from the ultimate dimen-sion of phenomena to merge with the pledge one) has always been present.Padmavajra, in his Commentary on [Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra(Toh. 2502, vol. ’I, f. 114b2-4), explains that the pledge being is the union of the traineewith the image of the deity through intense effort to achieve such union, resolve, andsingle-minded contemplation. The pristine awareness being is of two kinds: one bornfrom the perfections (p›ramit›) and one born from pristine awareness (jñ›na). The oneborn from the perfections is the one who seeks higher levels by way of traversing the tenstages (bhámi) and practicing the ten perfections. The one born from pristine awarenessis the manifestation as the form of the lord of the mandala with retinue produced fromthe realization of pure awakening mind (bodhicitta). See IBTS, p. 162, n. 17, forTsongkapa’s explanation of these.5. The phrase of the Compendium “not to be a receptacle for the sublime teachings” isexplained by Tsongkapa as meaning “not a receptacle for using in the path deeds ofdesire—this being unusual or contrary to the [ways of the] world” (YT, p. 58).6. The phrase of the Compendium “to train [while] being conditioned by concepts aboutthe purity or impurity of things” is explained by Tsongkapa as meaning “achieve thepath through practices involving thoughts on the features of faults such as birth, ageing,and so forth, in conjunction with the conception of true existence” (YT, p. 58).7. Concerning these families, Butön states that Trisamaya and other secret mantra dei-ties empowered by the transcendent ones (who have realized the ultimate nature ofthings, or, in other words, “have gone to transcendent reality” [de bzhin gshegs pa]),belong to the transcendent family (de bzhin gshegs pa’i rigs, tath›gatakula). The tantras ofthese families have been spoken by the transcendent ones with the aim of bestowing onhumans and gods the highest attainment.Tara and other deities empowered by Avalokiteshvara (who sees all sentient beingswith the eye of compassion undefiled by emotional afflictions) belong to the lotus fam-ily (padma’i rigs, padmakula).

The tantras of this family have beenspoken by Vajrapani with the aim of subduing secretive yakshas.Manibhadra and others who are empowered as an inexhaustible source of wealth inorder to eliminate the suffering of poverty amongst sentient beings belong to the wealthyfamily (nor can gyi rigs, maòikula).Panchaka, the one “playing with five dice,” along with five hundred children, Mekhala(his consort), and so on, who accomplish the rites for having children, increasing wealth,and so on, belong to the prosperity family (rgyas pa’i rigs, pauýîikakula) (also known asthe elephant or ox family). The tantras of this family have been spoken by Manibhadraand *Purnapitri (Gang po pha), two divine and wealthy sages, and set forth rites toaccomplish various aims such as winning wars, increasing prosperity, resolving quarrelsand conflicts, providing protection, gaining power, finding a spouse, and so forth.Gods, demi-gods, and others, excluding those belonging to the other five families,who have offered their individual secret mantras and rites to the Buddha, belong to thefamily of worldlings (’jig rten phal pa’i rigs, laukikakula). The tantras of these familieshave been taught by gods, demi-gods, and others who had faith in the Buddha and havebeen spoken with his approval (BGP, ff. 248b2-253b3).8.

Through retention mantra (gzungs sngags), the meaning of the two man-tras are retained and realized by wisdom. Hence, retention mantras are part of bothsecret and awareness mantras. Ultimately, all three types of mantra represent pristineawareness, which is the indivisibility of method and wisdom. Since such pristine aware-ness cognizes ultimate reality and protects beings and their minds, it is secret mantra; asit overcomes ignorance and unveils knowledge, it is awareness mantra. In this sense, theterms “secret mantra” or “awareness mantra” can refer to any deity, male or female (BGP,f. 260a2-5).See also Buddhaguhya’s Commentary on the Subahu Tantra (Toh. 2673), vol.

The word as a whole,pranayama (srog rtsol), means to block or hold the life wind (srog ’gog pa). When the lifewind is retained, one’s mind recalls the focus of meditation without distraction. To re-tain means to inhale, fill, and push the upper wind down and draw the lower wind up tobe held at the region of the navel.

Inaction tantra, pranayama means to stop the movement of wind which serves as themount for discursive thoughts and to bind the wind inside. It is applied in the context ofboth meditation with signs and meditation without signs. Its purpose is to have signs ofseeing and touching the deity. Its mode is the cultivation of clarity of visualization andpride of being the deity. In highest yoga tantra, pranayama refers to the stopping of theflow of the winds in the rasana and lalana channels. It is applied in the context of thephase of completion. Its purpose is to direct the wind into the central channel. Its modeis one of cultivation of the phase of isolation of speech (Longdol Lama’s Sets of TermsDerived from the Awareness-Holder Collection of Secret Mantra, Drepung Loseling Publi-cations, p. 184).35.

Its attainment is charac-terized by the special bliss of physical and mental pliancy. It is so called because, havingpacified distractions, one focuses joyfully and uninterruptedly on an inner image. Onthe basis of such quiescence, the meditator can unwaveringly analyze the nature of mind.See Takpo Tashi Namgyal’s Mahamudra (English translation), pp. 26-38; also Hopkins’sME, pp. 86-90.43.

Contemplation in this way over a long period of time leads to numer-ous effects: comfort and ease in body and mind; absence of hunger and thirst; reductionof feces and urine; increase in heat and bliss; and being unaffected by subtle obstacles,outer or inner. These are indications of having accomplished dwelling in fire. Source:Longdol Lama’s Sets of Terms Derived from the Awareness-Holder Collection of Secret Man-tra, pp. 184-185.

Taranata briefly describes the action tantra style of meditation in his Elucidation ofthe Indestructible Way, Collected Works, vol. 8, f. 4a7-b2. The procedure for action tantradiffers from that of highest yoga tantra for which the deity in front is generated by firstvisualizing the pledge being (dam tshig sems dpa’, samayasattva) in front and then imag-ining that the pristine awareness being (ye shes sems dpa’, jñ›nasattva) merges with it. Fora description of the exhibitions of hand mudras or “seals” (phyag rgya bstan) in thistantra, see Kedrupjé’s IBTS, p. 179.49. See Kedrupjé’s position on this point in IBTS, pp. 163-171.50. Dharmashri also accepts this position. In his Commentary on the Three Vows, hestates that in ordinary forms of action tantra, there is no generation of oneself as thedeity. One simply invites the deity in front and considers oneself as simply belonging tothe entourage. The special forms of meditation, however, do teach generation of oneselfas the deity (The Commentary that Ascertains the Three Vows: The Wish-Fulfilling Awn ofGood Explanations, commentary on Ngari Panchen’s Three Vows [henceforth cited asVOWS], f. 212a3-4).51. The branches of self-generation refer to the four branches of the phase of generation,which are set forth in different ways depending on the tantra. The four serve to purifythe ordinary stages of life and death. To use the Hevajra tantra as an example, the firstbranch is the basis for the generation phase and consists in the contemplation of empti-ness. The second branch consists in the contemplation of the seed syllable hum fromwhich the deity is generated, with the radiation and reconvergence of light. The thirdconsists in the contemplation of the fully manifest form of the deity originating fromthe letter hum. The fourth branch consists in the blessing of the senses, placing letters inthem, receiving the initiation, and sealing the deity with the lord of the family.

Deliberate behavior (brtul zhugs, vrata) is defined by Kongtrul as the transforming(brtul) of ordinary activity and thoughts and the entering (zhugs) into the mode ofVajrasattva’s body, speech, and mind. To effect such transformation, the nature of whichvaries according to different tantras, necessitates forsaking all that is contrary to tantricteachings and safeguarding vows and pledges. For this reason, the term brtul bzhug con-veys the sense of “vow” (sdom pa, samvara) and may also be translated as “observance.”For its nature in the context of highest yoga tantra, see below, Chapter 14, n. 40; also,Kongtrul’s Buddhist Ethics (English translation), p. 243; and Padmavajra’s Commentaryon the Guide to the Meaning of Tantra (Toh. 2502), vol. ’I, f. 97b7.2. Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra (Toh. 447), vol. Ca, f.285a6-7.3. Of the conduct tantras that have been translated into Tibetan, the Vairochanabhisam-bodhi Tantra (Toh. 494) represents the main tantra of the family of awakened body andthe most important of all conduct tantras. The main deity it presents is yellow Vairochanain the attire of universal ruler, with hands resting in meditation posture. No tantrabelonging to the family of awakened speech has been translated into Tibetan. TheVajrapani Initiation Tantra (Toh. 496) is the main tantra of the awakened mind family,which has as its principal deity Vajrapani in a peaceful form (Taranata’s Elucidation of theIndestructible Way, Collected Works, vol. 8, ff. 4b7-5b7).4.

Then, the master, while uttering en-couraging words, holds a golden chirurgical spoon (gser gyi thur ma) (used to removecataract) in front of the student’s eyes to symbolize that all the buddhas are removing hisor her ignorance. Holding up a mirror (me long), the master explains the characteristicsof phenomena with these words: “All things are like a reflection, limpid and undefiled,and cannot be grasped by the conceptual mind or expressed in words; arising fromcauses and actions, they lack intrinsic nature and do not endure. Understand all phe-nomena to be like that, and work unfailingly for the welfare of others.” Placing a wheel,symbolic of the exposition of the teachings (chos bshad), below the foot of the studentand a fine conch-shell in the left hand, the master authorizes him or her to teach con-duct tantra.

The thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a buddha’s body (sku mtshan dpe) arethe result of various wholesome deeds. For example, a buddha’s palms and soles aremarked with wheels as a result of generosity; his fingers and toes are connected by a webdue to not destroying the friendships of others through slander, and so forth.

II, pp. 625-626.10. The five initiations of awareness (rig pa’i dbang, vidy›seka) are so called because theyare conferred by vidyas (awareness consorts), such as Lochana, or because their nature ispristine awareness (ye shes, jñ›na), which serves as remedy for the various emotionalafflictions, the principal of which is unawareness or ignorance (ma rig pa, avidy›), bytransforming them into the five pristine awarenesses.11. The hand mudra of the ultimate dimension of phenomena is formed with the handsclose to each other in fists with the thumbs inside and the index fingers erect; the mantrais namo samanta buddhanam dharmadhatu svabhava atmako ham. The hand mudra ofthe wheel of the doctrine is formed by turning the fingers and uniting them with thethumbs touching; the mantra is namo samanta vajranam vajra atmako ham (Jayaprabha’sSadhana of Vairochana, Toh. 2665, vol.

This tantra was not translated into Tibetan. The verse is cited in Buddhaguhya’sExtensive Commentary on the Vajravidarana Tantra (Toh. 2680), vol. Thu, f. 179b6-7.16. These preliminaries are discussed in YT as part of action tantra’s meditation proce-dure (pp. 77-101; 115-138).Concerning the meaning of outer and inner cleansing, Buddhaguhya states that theouter cleansing is effected with water, and the inner cleansing, through confession andsupplication and by the release of the hand mudra (phyag rgya dgrol ba). Release of thehand mudra refers to the mudra in which the two hands (the five fingers of the righthand generated as the five primordial buddhas and those of the left as their consorts) areclasped together with the middle fingers outstretched and touching, then the hands sepa-rated while imagining that all one’s negativities, unwholesome actions, and obscurationsare purified (Guide to the Meaning of Tantra, Toh. 2501, vol. ’I, ff. 36b1-37a2).The circle of protection (srung ’khor) most commonly refers to an enclosure com-posed of vajras, the ground and roof encircled by fire.17. Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra (Toh. 494), vol. Tha, ff. 189b7-190a5.18. Source of phenomena or qualities (chos ’byung, dharmodaya). Pundarika definesdharmodaya as that from which phenomena devoid of intrinsic nature originate. “Phe-nomena devoid of intrinsic nature” refers to the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, andthe other 84,000 aspects of the teachings. Their source, dharmodaya, is the pure realm,the abode of all buddhas and bodhisattvas, the place of bliss, the place of birth; it is notthe place that discharges blood, urine, and regenerative fluids, i.e., the vagina. Source:Stainless Light, Toh. 1347, vol. Da, f. 237a3-5.19. Protection of the place consists in the emanation of wrathful deities and the elimina-tion of obstructive forces. Protection of oneself consists in contemplating emptinessalone. Protection of the yoga has two aspects: one is of the nature of the accumulation ofmerit and the other of wisdom. The first aspect consists in the contemplation of the fourimmeasurable thoughts (love, compassion, joy, and equanimity). The second consists inthe contemplation of the gates to emancipation (emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness,and the unconditioned) (Nagarjuna’s Large Commentary on the Eighteenth Chapter, Toh.1784, vol.

The outer four-branched recitation (phyi’i bzlas brjod yan lag bzhi) comprises one,the subjective base (bdag gi gzhi), oneself as the deity; two, the objective base (gzhan gyigzhi), the deity in front; three, immersion in mind (sems la gzhol ba), meditation onone’s own mind as the moon disk in the heart of the deity in front; and four, immersionin sound (sgra la gzhol ba), contemplation of the syllables of the mantra on the moondisk.The inner four-branched recitation (nang gi bzlas brjod yan lag bzhi) comprises one,the subjective base, self-generation as Shakyamuni; two, the objective base, contempla-tion of Vairochana on a moon disk at one’s heart; three, immersion in mind, imaginingone’s mind in the shape of a moon disk in the heart of Vairochana; and four, immersionin sound, imagining the syllables of the mantra on that moon disk.The first recitation is called outer because deity, moon, and syllables are visualizedexternal to oneself; the second, inner because one visualizes them within the subjectiveground, i.e., oneself as the deity. See Kedrupjé’s IBTS, pp. 207-208; and YT, pp. 189-195.In both the outer and inner branches, mental recitation is done while performingbreath-control techniques and stopping distraction. It is not possible to do the whis-pered recitation because the breath is held.26. Here, “learned masters” refers primarily to Buddhaguhya.

The inner mandalas (dkyil ’khor) of the four elements refers to the visualization ofthe elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. In this context, one thinks of them as beingthe nature of the different parts of one’s body: the yellow mandala of earth extends fromthe feet to the waist; the white mandala of water, from the waist to the heart; the redmandala of fire, from the heart to the eyebrows; and the black mandala of wind, fromthe eyebrows up.

In a view unique to conduct tantra, the great level of the path of accumulation correspondsto the stage of “practice with appreciation” (mos spyod kyi sa), while “practice with apprecia-tion”, generally speaking, covers both the path of accumulation and that of preparation.Appreciation (mos pa), according to Buddhaguhya, refers to a constant admiration ofthe qualities of the levels of awakening, the perfections, and the buddhas, known throughstudy, reflection, and contemplation. Through the force of such admiration, the yogindevelops the three minds—the mind of entering, developed by viewing the person andphenomena as mere illusions devoid of inherent reality; the mind of abiding, by restingin nonconceptual contemplation of the first mind; and the mind of emerging, by prac-ticing (spyod pa) the ten perfections—the four ways of attracting students, and so on,motivated by compassion for others. Source: Extensive Commentary on the Vairo-chanabhisambodhi Tantra (Toh. 2663), vol. Nyu, ff. 292a3.34. The ten stages of practice with appreciation consist of ten levels in which the trainee,through the force of appreciation (mos pa), engages (spyod pa) in the spheres of practiceof the actual ten stages of awakening (i.e., the ten perfections). These are not the tenstages of awakening of a bodhisattva but do lead to them. See Buddhaguhya’s ExtensiveCommentary (Toh. 2663), vol. Nyu, f. 292a5-b7.35. The stage conducive to definitive separation (nges ’byed cha mthun gyi sa) usually issynonymous with the path of preparation. It is so called because it is conducive to thepath of seeing on which one separates from mistaken adherence to the self of personsand self of phenomena. See IOK, vol. III, p. 476.36. The five seed syllables of the great hero (dpa’ bo ’bru lnga): a bhi ra hum kham.

Special mention is made here to this dimension as one offull awakening because, in this system, as one realizes the pristine awareness of the ulti-mate dimension of phenomena (chos dbyings ye shes, dharmadh›tujñ›na), the essence ofwhich is Vairochana, one takes the form of Great Vairochana, the enjoyment dimensionin the pure land of Unsurpassed.

In yoga tantra, the retinue of the main deities of the mandala includes a variety ofdeities. Among others are offering goddesses emanated from the heart of oneself as thedeity. The dimension of the offering accompanied by recollection of their symbologyinduces a state of contemplation through the sense experience produced by the offering.Muditakosha states that the eight goddesses [L›sy› (drum player), M›l› (who offersjewel garlands), G¦t› (the singer), Nart¦ (the dancer), Dháp¦ (who offers incense), Puýp›(who offers flowers), Ålok› (who offers butterlamps), and Ghaºda (who offers perfume)]symbolize the perfections of generosity, morality, patience, effort, wisdom, meditation,aspiration, and skillful method, which turn one away from miserliness, tainted morality,aversion, laziness, tainted wisdom, distraction, pride, and ignorance of the methods,respectively (Description of the Deities of the Vajradhatumandala, Toh. 2504, vol. Ri, ff.203b5-204a2).Anandagarbha explains that, in this context, secret offering refers to the offering ofdance, and so forth, made by the first four goddesses of offering emanated from one’sheart. Such offerings are “secret” because they are of the nature of mind (Illumination ofthe Summation of Essential Principles, Toh. 2510, vol. Li, f. 92b5). Dhupi, who offersincense, is called chief of the attendants (g.yog ma’i gtso mo) because she is of the natureof transcendent wisdom. Just as a worldly attendant generates mundane pleasure andjoy, transcendent wisdom produces supramundane bliss and joy (f. 93a3-4). Anandagarbhadiscusses in detail the offering goddesses and their functions in his Illumination of theSummation of Essential Principles, ff. 89b7-96b3.3. Illumination of the Summation of Essential Principles (Toh. 2510), vol. Li, f. 27a1-2:Anandagarbha’s two-volume commentary (vols. Li and Shi) on the Summation of Essen-tial Principles (Tattvasaôgrahatantra, Toh. 479). The Summation of Essential Principles isthe main scripture of yoga tantra. It includes a Continuation Tantra (Uttaratantra, rGyudphyi ma) and a Continuation of the Continuation (Uttarotantra, Phyi ma’i phyi ma). Thescripture comprises four sections or chapters known as Indestructible Dimension(Vajradh›tu), Victory over the Three Worlds (Trilokyavijaya), Training Beings (Jagadvinaya),and Accomplishing All Aims (Siddh›rtha). See IBTS, pp. 216-217, n. 6; and Butön’sSurvey of Yoga Tantra.4. The ten essential principles of tantric expertise are explained by Pema Karpo: Mandala(dkyil ’khor) is of two kinds, form and formless. Mantra (sngags) includes the period forrecitation and the number to be accomplished, a painting of the deity, the posture to beadopted during recitation, the manner of reciting, the procedure for vajra recitation,and the way to achieve results from recitation. The seals or mudras (phyag rgya) consistin the four seals of yoga tantra applied to the deities subsequent to the three contempla-tions of initial union, supremely triumphant mandala, and supremely triumphant act.Protection of oneself and the place (bdag dang gnas bsrung ba) includes ablutions, wear-ing new clothes, and empowering the tongue; alternatively, it refers to the safeguardingof one’s yoga practice itself. The ritual of inviting the deities (lha rnams spyan drang pa)consists in the merging of the awareness deities with the pledge deities, preceded by theoffering of praises to them. Recitation (bzlas brjod) includes verbal recitation and vajra(mental) recitation. Meditation (bsgom pa) consists in the three contemplations appliedin their entirety during familiarization with the deity, the four yogas, the heart mandala,and so forth. Inner and outer fire-offering rituals (phyi dang nang gi bdag nyid can gyi"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"sbyin sreg) refer to rituals to be performed on the occasions of worship of the mandala,and so on. Dissolution (nye bar bsdu ba) consists in the ritual of releasing the seals, i.e.,interrupting the contemplation of oneself as the deity. Requests for departure (gshegs sugsol ba) are requests to depart made to the pristine awareness deities following offeringsmade by the eight goddesses.The ultimate essential principle, wisdom in nature, refers to pristine awareness freefrom conceptual limits, the indivisibility of the ultimate dimension of phenomena(dharmadh›tu) and the awareness that realizes that dimension, infallible with respect tothe true nature of reality itself. The relative essential principles, method in nature, referto the body of the deity, the mantra, seals, and so forth, which appear through the powerof pristine awareness, infallible with respect to the accomplishment of the welfare ofsentient beings. Source: TV, vol. Ca, ch. 3, ff. 79a1-80a3.5. Padmavajra explains that yoga (rnal ’byor) means union (sbyor ba) with the ultimatedimension of phenomena (dharmadh›tu) by means of pristine awareness (Commentaryon the Guide to the Meaning of Tantra, Toh. 2502, vol. ’I, f. 97a2). He defines contem-plation (ting nge ’dzin, sam›dhi) as the mental application that serves as the door toliberation through blocking the outward movement of discursive thoughts and placingmind undividedly on the meditation object. Moreover, contemplation is of two types:that of the natural condition (rang bzhin gyi -) and a concordant contemplation (rjes sumthun pa’i -). The first denotes the liberation of the transcendent ones and the greatbodhisattvas; the second, the contemplation of a yogin who engages in mantra practicewhich conforms to that of the transcendent ones and the bodhisattvas (f. 96a4).Butön explains that yoga means “mind placed in a state of even contemplation” (semsmnyam par bzhag pa). Through the force of this even state, the various tantric methodsapplied by the practitioner in order to accomplish the scope of the bodhisattva (such asmantras, seals, mandala rituals, and conferral of initiations) are all connected and uni-fied. Hence, this tantra is called “yoga tantra” (Survey of Yoga Tantra, f. 3b1-2).Ratnakarashanti’s Commentary on [Nagarjuna’s] Brief Sadhana [of Guhyasamaja] CalledPrecious Garland (Toh. 1826, vol. Ci, f. 16a1) says: “What is the meaning of yoga (rnal’byor)? In its literal meaning, it refers to the indivisibility of emptiness and compassion.In its general meaning, it refers to the unification of method and wisdom. In its hiddenmeaning, it refers to the union of vajra and lotus. In its ultimate meaning, it refers to therealization of the indivisible state of luminous clarity.”6.

Translated here is the full form as it appears in the tantra itself.Discussing the five families (rigs lnga, pañcakula) in the context of yoga tantra, PemaKarpo explains that ku in kula (family) is related to kusti, meaning “bad” (ngan pa); andla, to laya, meaning “to enter” (thim pa). The families are of two kinds, inferior (dmanpa) and superior (mchog). To the inferior families belong beings who have entered (thimpa) miserable existences (ngan ’gro) as a result of their emotional afflictions. Beings whohave good natures and whose emotional afflictions are in equal strength belong equallyto all five families. Beings who are dominated by desire (’dod chags) belong to the buddhafamily or transcendent family (de bzhin gshegs pa’i rigs, tath›gatakula); beings dominatedby aversion (zhe sdang), to the vajra family (rdo rje’i rigs, vajrakula); beings dominated byavarice (ser sna), to the jewel family (nor bu’i rigs, ratnakula); beings dominated by delu-NOTES TO PAGES 128 TO 129\u0002403"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"404\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAsion (gti mug), to the lotus family (pad ma’i rigs, padmakula); and beings dominated bylaziness (le lo), to the action family (las kyi rigs, karmakula).To the superior or adamantine families belong awakened beings, buddhas, andbodhisattvas who have transcended lower destinies, are free of the obscurations of infe-rior families, and represent the means to remedy the emotional afflictions of the inferiorfamilies. The natures of the superior families reflect the above etymology in that they arethe families of those buddhas and bodhisattvas who, by the force of their compassion forothers, have entered (thim pa) miserable existences (ngan ’gros). The superior families arethose of the five transcendent ones: Vairochana (transcendent family), Akshobhya (vajrafamily), Ratnasambhava (jewel family), Amitabha (lotus family), and Amoghasiddhi(action family). They are “transcendent families” because they are of the natures of allthe transcendent ones (TV, vol. Ca, ch. 3, f. 64a1-b4).Butön explains that the transcendent family is taught for the sake of beings domi-nated by desire. Deities belonging to this family therefore display aspects of desire. Thefamily is of the nature of awakening mind (bodhicitta) and the utterly pure pristineawareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena (chos dbyings ye shes).The vajra family is taught for the sake of beings dominated by aversion. Deitiesbelonging to this family display aspects of wrath. The family is of the nature of method(to guide followers of the Buddha’s teaching who are difficult to train) and the mirror-like pristine awareness (me long lta bu’i ye shes).The jewel family is taught for the sake of those dominated by greed, who cravewealth and are miserly. The deities are golden in color and display aspects of bounteous-ness. The family is of the nature of awakened generosity, which grants the wishes of allbeings, and the pristine awareness of total sameness (mnyam nyid kyi ye shes).The lotus family is taught for the sake of those dominated by delusion who worshipnon-Buddhist deities and adhere to wrong views. Deities belonging to this family dis-play the various aspects of Buddhist and non-Buddhist deities. The family is of thenature of the perfected wisdom of all buddhas and the discerning pristine awareness (sosor rtog pa’i ye shes).The action family is taught for the sake of those who, out of laziness, do not makeofferings to the Three Jewels and do not work for the welfare of others. Deities belong-ing to this family are green in color and manifest various aspects, peaceful and wrathful.The family is of the nature of the energy of all buddhas and the pristine awareness ofaccomplishment (bya ba grub pa’i ye shes) (Survey of Yoga Tantra, f. 44a3-b1).Buddhaguhya’s Guide to the Meaning of Tantra states that the five families are positedwith respect to the five aspects of the dimension of all buddhas, namely, permanence(rtag pa), stability (mi ’khrugs pa), precious power (rin chen dbang), measureless light (’oddpag tu med pa), and unfailing accomplishment (don yod grub pa). Each of the fivefamilies (of Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi)are subdivided into five attendant families in terms of the five aforementioned aspects(Toh. 2501, vol. ’I, f. 11a7-b2).The five principal and five lesser families, according to Pema Karpo, are subdividedinto four, each in terms of awakened body (sku), mind (thugs), speech (gsung), and activ-ity (phrin las). These are, respectively, the deities of the heart (snying po), deities of theseal (phyag rgya), secret mantra deities (gsang sngags), and awareness mantra deities (rigsngags) (TV, vol. Ca, ch. 3, ff. 66a1-67b2)."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Butön (BGP, f. 270a2-b4) notes that although the families number five, the foursections (mentioned above in n. 3) of the Summation of Essential Principles and of theGlorious Supreme Original Being Tantra (Paramadya Tantra) present only four families.The first section teaches the way of subjugating beings belonging to the transcendentfamily. The second, third, and fourth sections teach the way of subjugating those of thevajra family, lotus family, and jewel family, respectively. The action family, being of thenature of the endeavor that fulfills the wishes of all beings, is subsumed under the jewelfamily. The action family is, however, mentioned separately in the Glorious SupremeOriginal Being Tantra.7. The yoga tantras of method present primarily the ten essential principles of tantricexpertise and for this reason are called the father tantras, or method tantras. The Glori-ous Supreme Original Being Tantra (Toh. 487) and the Mode of Transcendent Wisdom inOne Hundred and Fifty Stanzas (Toh. 489) are mother, or wisdom, tantras. However,each of these tantras has both the aspect of method and that of wisdom (Butön’s Surveyof Yoga Tantra, ff. 54b7-55b1).According to Taranata, the Glorious Supreme Original Being is a wisdom tantra, andall other yoga tantras are method tantras (Elucidation of the Indestructible Way, CollectedWorks, vol. 8, f. 6b4). However, Butön states that each section of the Summation ofEssential Principles includes the heart, seal, secret mantra, and awareness mantra. Heartconsists in the mandala of the body (k›ya-maòçala) in which the great seal is empha-sized. Seal consists in the retention mantra mandala (dh›raò¦-maòçala) in which thepledge seal is emphasized. Secret mantra consists in the doctrine mandala (dharma-maòçala) in which the seal of the doctrine is emphasized. Awareness mantra consists inthe action mandala (karma-maòçala) in which the action seal is emphasized. In thedharani mandala, the dharani deities are arranged as insignias (vajra, etc.), and in theaction mandala, all deities, with the exception of the five transcendent ones, are trans-formed into female deities; thus, these two are wisdom mandalas. The other two aremethod mandalas. In an ultimate sense, all method and wisdom tantras teach solely theyoga of the union of method and wisdom. Differentiation into method yoga tantra andwisdom yoga tantra is done for the sake of attracting students (BGP, f. 271a3-b2).8. Special deity (lhag pa’i lha, adhideva): the main deity with which the yogin mustfamiliarize in order to gain powers. The term “deity” (lha, deva) is generally understoodon two levels, ultimate and relative. Padmavajra states that, on the ultimate level, the deityis characterized by being the inseparability of the deity’s nature and emptiness. On therelative level, the deity is a buddha, bodhisattva, and so forth, appearing as male or female,wrathful or peaceful, or as the chief and retinue, complete with limbs and other details ofthe body, and possessing the most splendid attire and ornaments.

Pema Karpo, citing the Indestructible Tent and other sources, states that anyone maybe introduced into the mandala regardless of being qualified or unqualified, provided heor she is motivated to enter. This is because by seeing the mandala of the ultimate di-mension of phenomena, even persons who are very greedy, or who harbor bad inten-tions and are irreverent, can be turned away from lower forms of life and have establishedwithin them the seeds of all attainments. Thus, to “merely enter” (gzhug pa tsam) indi-cates that unqualified persons may be introduced into the mandala, but not initiated(TV, vol.

In yoga tantra, the “fourteen defeating transgressions” are to violate the followingadmonishments: one, do not renounce the Three Jewels; two, do not forsake the awak-ening mind; three, do not disrespect the deities; four, do not criticize mantra and seals;five, do not disrespect the master; six, do not step over the master’s seat, and so forth, orover the weapons, ritual implements, or insignias of deities; seven, do not eat the wrongfoods; eight, do not divulge secret pristine awareness; nine, do not forsake the practice ofmantra and seals; ten, do not harm others; eleven, do not delight in the individual way;twelve, do not be discouraged in the face of difficulties encountered in working for thebenefit of others; thirteen, do not forsake training in the six perfections; fourteen, donot engage in what is unwholesome.The fourteen branch pledges are condensed into the following prescriptions relatedto the five families: one, to take refuge in the Three Jewels constitutes the three pledgesof the transcendent family of Vairochana; two, to commit oneself to the vajra seal, thebell seal, and the vajra master are the three pledges of the vajra family of Akshobhya;three, to be generous with spiritual teachings, material things, protection, and lovingkindness are the four pledges of the jewel family of Ratnasambhava; four, to maintainthe outer (action and conduct) tantras, the secret (yoga) tantra, and the three ways ofthe proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas are the three pledges of the lotusfamily of Amitabha; five, to make offerings is the single pledge of the action family ofAmoghasiddhi.As to the correspondence of the pledges with the particular families, Vairochanarepresents the family of the awakened body of the transcendent ones. This physicaldimension is the foundation for acquiring all good qualities, of which taking refuge inthe Three Jewels constitutes the root.Akshobhya represents the family of awakened mind, which is indivisible emptinessand compassion. One commits oneself to these two aspects, which are symbolized bythe vajra and bell, and to the vajra master who reveals their meaning.Ratnasambhava represents the family of awakened qualities, which, like a wish-grant-ing jewel, provides the source of all that is desirable. Likewise, the four kinds of generos-ity fulfill the hopes and desires of all beings.Amitabha represents the family of awakened speech from which originate the eighty-four thousand aspects of the teachings. These eighty-four thousand aspects are all in-cluded in the three spiritual ways: the outer way of proclaimers and solitary sages, theinner way of bodhisattvas, and secret way of mantric practitioners.Amoghasiddhi represents the family of awakened activity, the essence of which is tovenerate the buddhas and to work for the benefit of all beings. Both of these tasks areaccomplished by making offerings as much as possible. See IOK, vol. II, pp. 148-150.For a detailed discussion of yoga tantra pledges, see Kongtrul’s Buddhist Ethics (Englishtranslation), pp. 235-242.18. The dimensions of awakening are generally enumerated as three (sku gsum, k›ya):reality dimension (chos sku, dharmak›ya); complete enjoyment dimension (longs spyodrdzogs pa’i sku, sambhogak›ya); and manifest dimension (sprul pa’i sku, nirm›òak›ya). Inyoga tantra, four dimensions are taught: essential dimension (ngo bo nyid sku,svabh›vikak›ya), fruitional dimension (rnam par smin pa’i sku, vip›kak›ya), enjoymentdimension, and manifest dimension (IBTS, p. 223)."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"19. According to this view, Great Vairochana refers to the enjoyment dimension of awak-ening (sambhogak›ya), always present in the realm called Unsurpassed. The minorVairochana refers to the manifest form (nirm›òak›ya), whose emanations serve to turnthe wheel of the teaching.Great Unsurpassed Realm (’Og min, Akaniýîha), also called Richly Adorned GreatUnsurpassed (’Og min chen po stug po bkod pa), is the realm where all buddhas attainenlightenment. It does not belong to any of the three realms of cyclic existence. It iscalled “Unsurpassed” because the enjoyment dimension of Buddha Vairochana residesthere as, so to speak, a “king” of the “superior deities,” that is, a bodhisattva on the tenthstage of awakening. It is called “great” to distinguish it from the heaven of the samename that is within cyclic existence. For a discussion of the various perspectives on thisrealm, see IOK, vol. I, pp. 297-300.The five certainties (nges pa lnga) or perfections (phun sum tshogs pa) of the enjoy-ment dimension of awakening are as follows: certainty of abode (gnas) (abiding in theUnsurpassed Realm); certainty of nature (ngo bo) (adorned with the thirty-two majormarks and eighty minor marks of a buddha); certainty of time (dus) (remaining for aslong as cyclic existence endures); certainty of retinue (’khor) (attended only by bodhisattvason the tenth stage); and certainty of the doctrine (chos) (proclaiming only the teachingof the universal way) (IOK, vol. III, pp. 597-598).Sönam Tsemo speaks of five certainties associated with the manifest dimension ofawakening that taught yoga tantra: the certainties of teacher, retinue, time, abode, anddoctrine. The certainty of teacher refers to the manifest forms appearing in various places,like reflections of the moon in the water; certainty of retinue, beings who have at-tained levels of attainment; certainty of time, manifestation without interruption;certainty of abode, various places; and certainty of doctrine, that of the universal way(SGP, f. 45b2-6).20.

According to Sönam Tsemo (SGP, f. 44a1-3), in this latter view, Vairochana, or theminor Vairochana, represents the enjoyment dimension (sambhogak›ya), while GreatVairochana is the reality dimension of awakening (dharmak›ya).23. Padmavajra (Commentary on [Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra, Toh.2502, vol. ’I) explains that seal (phyag rgya, mudr›) signifies the power to gladden or tomake an impression. It “gladdens” owing to its ability to please the exalted ones; it is a“seal” because it cannot be erased and swiftly grants what is desired. It is also called“attribute” (mtshan ma, *nimitta) since it issues from pristine awareness and is linked tothe conception of an attribute. It is a “sign” (rtags, liºga) by virtue of having the nature ofgreat pristine awareness or issuing from its blessing. It is a “definite characteristic” (nyeba’i mtshan nyid, *upalakýaòa) because it points to pristine awareness or because throughit one enters into the state of pristine awareness (f. 94a6-b1).The four seals—the great seal (phyag rgya chen po, mah›mudr›); the pledge seal (damtshig gi phyag rgya, samayamudr›); the doctrine seal (chos kyi phyag rgya, dharmamudr›),NOTES TO PAGES 131 TO 133\u0002409"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"410\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAand the action seal of awakened activity (las kyi phyag rgya, karmamudr›)—correspondto the dimensions of awakened body, speech, mind, and activity, respectively.The great seal is the image of the deity’s body which reveals the mode of the form ofthe deity. Since it serves as the pre-eminent ground for contemplation of the authenticcondition of the deity by way of her form, it is called the great seal (f. 94b5-6).The seal of the pledge is the blessing of the seal of pristine awareness possessed ofperfect qualifications which reveals the mode of the deity’s mind as the seal of the fullyliberated mind. Since the deity does not transcend [pristine awareness], it is called theseal of the pledge (f. 95a1-2).The seal of the doctrine comprises the terms used in the teachings such as “inde-structible pristine awareness” (vajrajñ›na), “pledge being” (samayasattva), and so forth,which are the attributes or signs of pure awakened speech, and reveal the mode of thespeech of the deity. This seal imparts the ultimate teachings of the deity’s words (f. 95a4-5).The action seal of awakened activity comprises the deity’s actions and reveals themodes of these actions, which are of two kinds: bound and imagined. The first has thecharacteristics of the seal or mudra of the hands separated and forming two “vajra fists”(with the thumbs at the roots of the ring fingers), the seal of supreme awakening, and soon. The second is the four-pronged vajra imagined at one’s heart whose nature revealsthat at the time of attaining the state of a particular deity, the awakened activity of thatdeity pervades all things (f. 95a6-7).Longdol Lama presents the four seals in terms of unfolding experiential understand-ing: As a result of the gradual development of stable pride and clarity of vision of one’sordinary body as the deity and the mandala, one experiences the sign of almost seeingand touching the deity. That is known as the great seal of the body. The power of themantra is realized when the resonance of the winds of inhalation and exhalation associ-ated with all ordinary speech is experienced for a while as the resonating sound of themantra: this is known as the doctrine seal of speech. The method of the appearance ofthe circle of deities and the wisdom ascertaining emptiness increase on the basis of thebliss arising from physical and mental serviceability. The union of such appearance andemptiness is profound, luminous pristine awareness, the pledge seal of the mind. Inwhatever action is performed by the body, speech, and mind, the perception of ordinaryappearances and grasping to them is slight. Through simply the emanation andreconvergence of light, the four activities are accomplished. This is known as the seal ofawakened activities. The seal of the pledge pertains to signless meditation; the otherthree seals, to meditation with signs. Through the power of such method and wisdom,one attains the result. In this procedure, the symbolic outer seals are the mantra andhand mudras; the symbolized inner seal, the sealing of emptiness by bliss (Sets of TermsDerived From the Awareness-Holder Collection of Secret Mantra, pp. 187-188).Pema Karpo specifies that the four seals are distinguished according to their outerand inner aspects: Outer great seal includes paintings or statues of the deity; the innerconsists in the meditated image of the deity. Outer pledge seal is an external vajra orpainted representation of it; the inner, meditation on the vajra, and so forth. Outer seal ofthe doctrine includes verbal expressions, and the inner, the meditation of syllables on thetongue, and so forth. The outer seal of awakened activity is the drawing of seals, and soforth, and the inner, the meditation on them (TV, vol. Ca, ch. 3, ff. 81a6-83b4)."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"For a comprehensive discussion of the four seals in the yoga tantra system, see Butön’sSurvey of Yoga Tantra; Buddhaguhya’s Guide to the Meaning of Tantra, a commentary onthe Summation of Essential Principles, Toh. 2501, ff. 5a7-7a6; and IBTS, pp. 223-249. 24. In the context of the universal way, centrists (m›dhyamika) and idealists (cittam›tra)speak of the eightfold group of consciousnesses (rnam shes tshogs brgyad, aýîavijñ›nak›ya):the ground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes, ›layavijñ›na); afflicted conscious-ness (nyon yid rnam shes, kliýîamanovijñ›na); mental consciousness (yid kyi rnam shes,manovijñ›na); and the five sense consciousnesses (sgo lnga’i rnam shes).The ground-of-all consciousness is described as a neutral mind which serves as theground for the accumulation of seeds or predispositions for the arising of the elements,aggregates, and sense fields of sentient beings. Such consciousness focuses on a variety ofobjects but knows merely their entities. It is called “ground-of-all,” or the basis for every-thing, because it serves as the foundation of cyclic life and perfect peace. After diamond-like contemplation has arisen, this consciousness transforms into mirror-like pristineawareness. The afflicted consciousness arises in the aspect of a conceited mental state,derived from the pride associated with thinking in terms of an “I.” It is neutral butobscured by afflictions and serves as the main condition for the arising of mental in-volvement. Upon the attainment of awakening, it transforms into the pristine awarenessof total sameness. The five sense consciousnesses perceive the details of objects by clearlyfocusing upon them. They are neutral but arise as virtue or nonvirtue due to the types ofmental factors attending them. The mental, or subjective, consciousness which per-ceives mental phenomena, upon the attainment of awakening, transforms into discern-ing pristine awareness, and the five sense consciousnesses transform into accomplishingpristine awareness. See IOK, vol. II, pp. 386-397.25. Padmavajra explains that mirror-like pristine awareness (me long lta bu’i ye shes,›darŸajñ›na) is the realization that appearances are without inherent nature. Pristineawareness of total sameness (mnyam nyid ye shes, samat›jñ›na) is the realization that doesnot discriminate between oneself and other. Discerning pristine awareness (sor rtog yeshes, pratyavekýaòajñ›na) is the realization that the general and specific characteristicsof phenomena are without inherent nature. Accomplishing pristine awareness (bya bagrub pa’i ye shes, kæîy›nusth›najñ›na) is working for oneself and others without partial-ity. Pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena (chos dbyings ye shes,dharmadh›tujñ›na) is the nature of all the other four as well as their objects. SeeCommentary on [Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra (Toh. 2502), vol. ’I, f.98a4-5.26. In yoga tantra, the contemplation of the deity, or deity yoga, is done by way of the“impressions” of seals. The four seals constitute the path of purification. Their sphere ofpurification comprises ordinary body, speech, mind, and activities; as well, they purifythe afflictions of desire, aversion, delusion, avarice, and laziness. The purpose of im-pressing the seals is to merge and unify the body, speech, mind, and activities of thepristine awareness deity with those of the pledge deity.The seals are executed in relation to each deity, Vairochana and the others. For eachseal, there is a symbolized object, as well as external and internal symbolic representa-tions. In the case of the great seal, the former is the body of the deity. The externalsymbol is the hand mudra appropriate to the particular deity, and the internal, the visu-NOTES TO PAGE 133\u0002411"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"412\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAalization of oneself as the deity’s form. For the pledge seal, the symbolized seal is thenonconceptual mind of the deity and the deity itself imagined to manifest as the corre-sponding insignia (vajra, noose, etc.). The external symbol is the appropriate hand mudra,and the internal, one’s nonconceptual pristine awareness and the visualization of oneselfas the deity appearing as the insignia. For the doctrine seal, the symbolized seal is themelodious speech of the deity expressing the teachings and the deity itself. The externalsymbol is the arrangement of letters on the deity’s tongue, and so forth, and the deityitself; the internal, the visualization of letters in oneself as the deity. For the seal ofawakened activities, the symbolized object is the deity and its awakened activities. Theexternal symbol is the crossed vajra at the heart of the deity; the internal, the visualiza-tion of a crossed vajra at one’s heart, and so forth.For a description of the actual method of execution of the seals in relation to thedeities as the five buddhas, Vairochana and the others, see Butön’s Survey of Yoga Tantra;and IBTS, pp. 241-247.27. Yoga tantra was also taught in the desire realm heaven called Mastery Over Others’Creations (gZhan ’phrul dbang byed) and in various unspecified places. See IOK, vol. I,p. 376.28. The all-powerful sovereign (’khor los sgyur ba’i rgyal po, cakravartin) likely refers toAkshobhya, Amitabha, Ratnasambhava, and Amoghasiddhi.29. Three contemplations (ting nge ’dzin, sam›dhi): initial union (dang po sbyor ba,prathama prayoga); supremely triumphant mandala (dkyil ’khor rgyal mchog, vijayamaòçala); and supremely triumphant act (las rgyal mchog, vijaya karma). Referring tothe explanation of these three given in the Vajra Garland, which applies to both outer(yoga tantra) and inner yoga (highest yoga tantra), Kongtrul states that they constitutethe main body of deity practice (s›dhana), and as such, are found in both yoga tantraand highest yoga father and mother tantras. In the highest yoga tantra, the three con-templations are branches of the phase of generation.The three contemplations are explained as follows: First, the initial union comprisesthe steps from the generation of the residence mandala up to the generation of oneself asthe male or female principal figure at its center. Because the contemplation of the centralfigure (who is the principal “emanator” of the other deities in the mandala) is performedprior to the other two contemplations, it is called “initial.” Since such contemplationinseparably unites method and wisdom, it is called “union.”Second, the supremely triumphant mandala comprises the steps of the generation ofthe mandala of the resident deities (emanated from the awakening mind of the maleand female central figures) arranged in their respective places. It is known as “trium-phant mandala” because it perfects the mandala of resident deities within the resi-dence mandala.Third, the supremely triumphant act consists in the deities’ performance of deedssuch as purifying realms. It is called “triumphant act” because these deeds conform withthe deeds of the Buddha (IOK, vol. III, pp. 171-172).30. According to Tsongkapa, the “tip” of the nose (sna rtser) does not mean the end ofthe nose but the root of the nose, or point between the eyes.

The meaning of center and surrounding are explained in two differentways: as the mandala of perfect shape and its “surrounding” wisdom of intrinsic aware-ness; or as the chief deity surrounded by retinue. The mandala exists on two levels, theultimate and the relative. The ultimate mandala is the wisdom of intrinsic awarenessimbued with the realization of the ultimate mind of awakening. The relative mandala istwofold, the mandala of the nature of the deities and the mandala of reflected images.Source: Padmavajra’s Commentary on [Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra(Toh. 2502), vol. ’I, f. 96b3-6.33.

Ultimate reality, although indivisible, is presented as a triad of “doors to liberation”(rnam thar sgo gsum) from the point of view of its nature. The emptiness door of libera-tion (rnam thar pa’i sgo stong pa nyid) refers to the emptiness of the nature of any particu-lar phenomenon. The wishlessness door (-smon pa med pa), in the context of generalBuddhist doctrine, refers to emptiness posited with respect to phenomena not inher-ently producing results. The signlessness door (-mtshan ma med pa) refers to the empti-ness of phenomena posited with respect to phenomena not having been inherentlyproduced from causes. A fourth door to liberation is spoken of, that of emptiness pos-ited in terms of the absence of conditioned actions (mngon par ’dus ma byas pa).35. Summation of Essential Principles (Toh. 479), vol.

Source: Ornament of Kosala (Toh. 2503), vol. Yi, f. 89a2-3.42. Shakyamitra, in his version of the Buddha’s awakening, uses the term “pristine aware-ness body” (ye shes kyi sku, jñ›nak›ya) instead of mental body (yid kyi rang bzhin gyi lus,manomayak›ya) and adds that, while on the banks of the Naranjana River practicingasceticism, the buddha-to-be left his body to proceed to the Unsurpassed Realm. There,empowered by the buddhas, he awakened, and after having taught yoga tantra on thesummit of Mount Meru, he again entered his physical body. An alternative view is thatheld by Anandagarbha, who states that the Buddha awakened countless aeons ago. Thesepositions of Shakyamitra and Anandagarbha represent the two divergent views on theBuddha’s awakening found in yoga tantra. For an extensive discussion, see IOK, vol. I,pp. 290-300.43. Reading su for sku. Padmavajra states that the “heart of awakening” (byang chubsnying po) is taken by some to mean the “seat of enlightenment” in reference to thephysical location where the Buddha awakened under the bodhi tree, and by others tomean the banks of the Naranjana River, where the Buddha, as a bodhisattva, practicedasceticism. Others consider “heart of awakening” to mean the nonconceptual state ofthe dimension of reality. The positions are not incompatible, he says, since wherever abodhisattva approaching awakening dwells, that “place” has the nature of the seat ofenlightenment. It is therefore acceptable to consider the banks of the Naranjana River asalso being the dimension of reality devoid of conceptual characteristics. Source: Commen-tary on [Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra (Toh. 2502), vol. ’I, f. 108b6-7.For Butön (Survey of Yoga Tantra, f. 6a1) the “heart of awakening” is the RichlyAdorned Unsurpassed Realm (’Og min stug po bkod), so called because it is like the heart(snying po) of many blissful buddha realms and the place where bodhisattvas awaken.44. Such contemplation is called “unstirring” because the outflow of the senses towardobjects and the movement of the breath have stopped (Padmavajra’s Commentary on[Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra, Toh. 2502, vol. ’I, f. 109a1-2). The sixqualities of this contemplation are enumerated by Butön (in his Survey of Yoga Tantra, f.6a4): “...stopping of inhalation; stopping of exhalation (’byung rngub pa ’gog pa); ab-sence of thought; undistractedness (sems pa med cing g.yo ba med); body unmoved byany circumstance (lus ni gang yang mi ’gul); and the limbs not stirring (yan lag bskyod parmi byed).” Shakyamitra states that to remain in such contemplation (short of perfectrealization) would not have allowed the bodhisattva to attain full awakening and workfor the welfare of all beings. Therefore, all the buddhas arouse the bodhisattva from thiscontemplation (Ornament of Kosala, Toh. 2503, vol. Yi, ff. 18b7-19a2).45. Kedrupjé explains that in the yoga tantra system, there are two sets of five awaken-ings: one set of the awakenings of the Buddha, the teacher; and a set constituting theprocedure to be practiced by later followers who would train in the way that uses theresult as the path (IBTS, pp. 29-35).The first set represents the final moment of a bodhisattva’s attainment of enlighten-ment known as “awakening to purity and total perfection” (mngon par byang chub pa,"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"abhisaôbodhi). It comprises five steps, which Padmavajra names as follows: awakeningthrough discriminative knowledge of one’s mind (rang gi sems so so rab tu rig pa lasmngon par byang chub pa); awakening through generation of the mind of awakening(byang chub tu sems bskyed pa las mngon par byang chub pa); awakening through abidingin the reality dimension of awakening (chos kyi skur gnas pa las mngon par byang chubpa); awakening through stabilization (brtan par byas pa las mngon par byang chub pa);and awakening through transformation into the body of the Enlightened One (i.e.,Mahavairochana) (sangs rgyas kyi skur gyur ba las mngon par byang chub pa) (Padmavajra’sCommentary on [Buddhaguhya’s] Guide to the Meaning of Tantra, Toh. 2502, f. 109a3-4).In the first step, one (the bodhisattva) examines one’s own mind. Realizing mindnature just as it is, one sees that nature as a moon disk at one’s heart. This realization hasthe nature of the immediate path of the causal pristine awareness characterizing the firstto the tenth stages of awakening. In the second step, one sees the nature of the mind ofawakening in the shape of a completely full moon disk at the heart, resembling a fullmoon. This is the fully liberated path (rnam grol lam). In the third step, one sees thenatures of the five pristine awarenesses as a five-pronged vajra at the heart and dwells inthat state. One thereby sees the pristine awareness of full liberation. In the fourth step,all the power of all the buddhas’ bodies, voices, and minds, and their five pristineawarenesses, and so forth, are absorbed into the vajra in one’s heart. As the fifth step,having actualized the great seal of awakened body, one assumes the typical form andattire of Vairochana (Padmavajra’s Commentary, f. 109a3-b1). Anandagarbha states thatsuch a sequence of awakenings accords with the manner of practice of later followers. Atthe moment of actually attaining the result, at the time of the first awakening, all theremaining awakenings occur as well since all five pristine awarenesses are of the samenature and distinguished only conceptually (Panchen Lozang Chögyen’s Presentation ofthe Doctrine in General and the Four Tantra Sets, p. 52).The second set of awakenings that constitute the particular procedure for the prac-tice of later followers is modelled on the set of five awakenings of the Buddha andinvolves using the five awakenings as factors for realization. For the way to do so, seeGyalwa Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description of the Vajra Body. In this text, Yang-gönpa alsosets forth the “inner” awakenings of highest yoga tantra as opposed to those of yogatantra, which are considered as “outer.” In the highest yoga tantra in general, these areknown as awakening through the moon, or mirror-like pristine awareness; through thesun, or pristine awareness of total sameness; through the seed syllable (or insignia), ordiscerning pristine awareness; through the merging, or accomplishing pristine aware-ness; and through the complete form, or the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimen-sion of phenomena (ff. 3b-5b).For a detailed discussion of both sets of five awakenings, see Butön’s Survey of YogaTantra, ff. 7b5-11a1; and General Presentation of the Tantra Sets, ff. 125a4-128a6.46. With the first awakening, the bodhisattva attains the mirror-like pristine awareness,which is of the essence of Akshobhya; with the second, the pristine awareness of totalsameness, the essence of Ratnasambhava; with the third, the discerning pristine aware-ness, the essence of Amitabha; with the fourth, the accomplishing pristine awareness,the essence of Amoghasiddhi; and with the fifth, the pristine awareness of the ultimatedimension of phenomena, the essence of Vairochana (IBTS, pp. 29-35).NOTES TO PAGE 139\u0002415"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"416\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA47. According to the universal way (Anandagarbha’s view in particular), the Buddha,after his enlightenment, remained in the Unsurpassed Realm as the enjoyment dimen-sion of awakening (sambhogak›ya). There, without stirring from the reality dimensionof awakening (dharmak›ya), he manifested in the world in his supreme manifest dimen-sion (nirm›òak›ya). In that emanation, he performed limitless deeds of great wonder.

Ca, f.285a4-5.3. Here, Heruka is a name for the deity Chakrasamvara and other chief male deities ofthe mother tantras (such as Hevajra, Buddhakapala, and Mahamaya). Vairochana (rNamsnang) refers to Guhyasamaja, Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, and other central figures in themandalas of father tantras.The term “heruka” has been translated into Tibetan as “blood drinker” (khrag ’thung),a translation deemed somewhat improper by Butön, the compiler of the Tibetan-lan-guage Buddhist Canon. More often than not, however, the term has been left untranslatedin Tibetan scriptures. As for the meaning of the term “heruka,” Kongtrul explains thathe means hetu (cause), where cause indicates emptiness, in that no phenomenon is bornfrom itself, from other, from both, or from no cause. Ru means rupa (form), where formindicates absence of any abiding or perishable aggregation. Ka stands for kachita thista,meaning “not abiding” in either of the two extremes of permanence or annihilation.Source: CH, f. 117b1-6.4. The first part of the citation from the Compendium, “...in the midst of an entourage ofqueens, ... and by means of the contemplation of great bliss, ...to dwell perfectly in thebhaga of the queen ...” is typical of the opening lines of various highest yoga tantras suchas Hevajra. This line is explained according to its literal meaning, general meaning,concealed meaning, and final meaning. Although according to the literal meaning, thisopening line explicitly refers to the teacher or proclaimer of the tantra, according to theother meanings, it points out the very essence of the highest yoga tantra.To explain the literal meaning, the divine palace, which is of the nature of bliss, restson a double vajra; and the double vajra itself, on a variegated lotus. The entire mandaladimension is contained within the source of phenomena (chos ’byung, dharmodaya), orsource of all awakened qualities, also called bhaga (vagina). In its symbolic form, thesource of phenomena is a triangular pyramid; in actuality, it is emptiness, the nature thatencompasses all existence. Thus, the consort’s bhaga stands for emptiness; and the con-sort is called “queen” (btsun mo) since she elicits unsurpassable joy. The source of phe-"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"nomena is referred to as “vagina” as a means to draw beings dominated by desire (CH, f.7a2). The plural “queens” is used because the consort with whom the teacher is unitedembodies all queens. See Abhayakara’s commentary on the opening lines of the SamputaTantra in Awn of Esoteric Instructions (Toh. 1198), vol. Cha, f. 5a2-b5.Corresponding to the above, taking the result as the path, a male trainee of highestyoga tantra generates himself as the main deity of the mandala in union with the con-sort. The union is both symbolic and actual. The former is the union of method (bliss)and wisdom (the understanding of emptiness). The latter is the physical union of themale and female, by means of which a blissful consciousness is generated and directed tothe understanding of reality. In that way, the adept “resides in the castle” of great blisswhich realizes emptiness.5. Vajra words (rdo rje’i tshig): words of the tantras, which are presented according to sixparameters (provisional meaning, definitive meaning, interpretable meaning, non-in-terpretable meaning, standard terminology, and coined terminology) and four modes(literal meaning, general meaning, concealed meaning, and final meaning).Kongtrul states that the most profound teachings are self-concealed since they arenot comprehended by certain non-Buddhist philosophers, proclaimers of the individualway, practitioners at the beginning of their training in the universal way of the perfec-tions, and practitioners inclined to emptiness alone. This does not mean that tantricteachings were withheld by the Buddha but that they were given in a way suited to thecapabilities, inclinations, and fortunes of disciples. Thus, the profound points of thetantras are concealed in vajra words so that they remain naturally hidden from those oflesser fortune, to prevent those of inferior faculties from committing the ill deed offorsaking the doctrine, and to prevent those under demonic influences and proud schol-ars from following their own inclinations with respect to the tantras (CPR, ff. 10b2-11a2).6. The six parameters (mtha’ drug, ýaîkoîi) refers to six levels of meaning in the contentof the tantras and the words that convey that content. These six parameters that expressthe different meanings are applied to the tantras to correctly understand them; thus,they constitute means of examination and ascertainment of the tantras (Taranata’s CSI,f. 11a3-5). See Chapter 16, “Exposition Methods in Highest Yoga Tantra”; alsoShraddhakaravarman’s Revealing the Seven Ornaments as Set Forth in the Compendium onthe Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra (Toh. 1789).7. Guhyasamaja Tantra (Toh. 442), f. 97b2. These words from the Guhyasamaja are notto be taken literally. They have been spoken in order to attract to the practice of Bud-dhist tantras certain types of persons (for example, worldly persons drawn by Vishnuand others’ advice to engage in perverted conduct such as sexual union with familymembers). In the provisional sense, the words “mother...” are spoken in reference to theyogin’s consort, whom he wishes to benefit as a mother, and so on. In the ultimate sense,mother, sister, and daughter refer to the luminous clarity of the three awakened dimen-sions: mother refers to dharmakaya; sister, to sambhogakaya; and daughter, to nirmanakaya(BGP, f. 57a1-6).“Mother” and the others are names that also appear in the group of eight types ofconsorts or wisdom women (rig ma, vidy›), on which the yogin relies to experience greatbliss. These eight types are known as mother (ma), sister (sring mo), daughter (bu mo),NOTES TO PAGES 140 TO 142\u0002417"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"418\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAniece (sring mo’i bu mo), maternal uncle’s wife (zhang po’i chung ma), maternal aunt (ma’ispun), mother-in-law (sgyug mo), and paternal aunt (pha’i sring mo). The names do notrefer to familial relations. When one is conferred the secret initiation, the master’s con-sort is considered as one’s mother. When one is initiated at the same time as the vajramaster, his consort is considered one’s sister. The female one initiates is one’s daughter;the female initiated by the aforementioned sister, one’s niece; the wife of the yogin whohas been initiated with the aforementioned mother, one’s maternal uncle’s wife; thefemale who has been initiated with the aforementioned mother, one’s maternal aunt; thewife of the master who confers the secret initiation on one’s master, one’s mother-in-law;and the female initiated with one’s master, one’s paternal aunt. This is the most prevalentexplanation of the eight consorts. See Naropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the Ini-tiation (Toh. 1351), vol. Na, f. 239b5.There are other explanations of the eight consorts. The Pristine Essence Tantra, forinstance, states that mother refers to a brahmin girl (bram ze bu mo); sister, to a dancer(gar ma); daughter, to a washerwoman (g.yung mo); niece, to a dyer (tshos mkhan mo);maternal uncle’s wife, to a girl of the artisan or merchant caste (rje ma); maternal aunt, toa girl of the warrior or royal caste (rgyal rigs); mother-in-law, to a girl of the menial caste(dmangs rigs); and paternal aunt, to an outcaste girl (gdol pa mo) (CH, ff. 284a5-285a4).The system of the Kalachakra tantra enumerates ten consorts corresponding to theten perfections, for which the ninth is a chandali (one dedicated to unlawful works), andthe tenth, a fisherwoman (nya pa mo). See Pundarika’s Stainless Light (Toh. 1347), vol.Da, f. 158a4-5.8. Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra (Toh. 443), vol. Ca, f. 150a1-2.9. The three aspects of tantra are said to be interconnected and are described as beinglike the continuous flow of a river. The continuum of the nature (rang bzhin gyi rgyud)is also known as causal continuum (rgyu’i rgyud); the continuum of the ground (gzhi’irgyud), which is the fundamental nature of phenomena (gzhi dngos po’i gnas lugs), is alsoknown as the continuum of method (thabs kyi rgyud) and the [continuum or] stage ofthe path (lam gyi rim pa). The indivisibility of body and mind is the continuum of thenature. The indivisibility of the phase of generation and the phase of completion is thecontinuum of the path. The indivisibility of the two dimensions of awakening is knownas resultant continuum. The nondual purity of body and mind, or pristine awareness, isknown as continuum because it is of the same nature as perfect awakening (MH, f.20a2-6).10. One’s intrinsic self-awareness (so so rang gi rig pa): “one’s intrinsic” inasmuch as theultimate nature of the mind (sems nyid) is not acquired from others but is naturallypresent in each individual, this “self-awareness” (rang gi rig pa), or awareness of aware-ness itself, is mind knowing itself, free of subject and object duality (Bokar Rinpoché,oral communication).11.

Source:Vasubandhu’s Explanation of the Scripture Ornament (Toh. 4029), f. 137b4.16. The reality dimension of awakening (chos sku, dharmak›ya) has a “static” aspect anda “dynamic” aspect, referred to, respectively, as the essential dimension (ngo bo nyid sku)and pristine awareness dimension of reality (ye shes chos sku). “The two purities” (dag pagnyis ldan) (the natural purity and the acquired purity) is an expression used in connec-tion with the essential dimension. The first purity describes the essential dimension ofawakening in its aspect of original purity (rang bzhin rnam dag gi char ’gyur ba’i ngo bonyid sku) or emptiness. The second purity describes that dimension in its aspect of newlygained purity from adventitious impurities (glo bur rnam dag char ’gyur ba’i ngo bo nyidsku).17.

An arhatwho still possesses a physical body has attained perfect peace with remainder.

See Chapter 1, n. 45.CHAPTER 7: THE CAUSAL CONTINUUM1. Shantigupta (õantigupta) (Zhi ba sbas pa) was the master of Buddhagupta, the Indianguru of Taranata. Taranata provides a lengthy account of Shantigupta’s life in his SevenInstruction Lineages. Born in southern India, Shantigupta became a monk and studiedall aspects of the Buddhist doctrine including tantra under Ratigupta. For six years, heperformed menial tasks for his teacher before being granted the highest instructions. Hebecame abbot of a monastery but eventually found his duties to be unconducive to hispractice and entreated the monks to excuse him from his position. In the end, however,he was forced to convince them to expel him by taking up drinking and other prohibitedactivities. Having left the monastery, he engaged in meditation on the banks of a riverand was befriended by six “messengers of knowledge” who manifested as prostitutes.Later, he came across a wine seller who revealed herself to be Vajrayogini and instructedhim to seek the guidance of Jnanamitra. For several years, Jnanamitra had him undergovarious trials, much like those Tilopa imposed on Naropa. On one occasion, when hisNOTES TO PAGES 143 TO 150\u0002419"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"420\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAmaster was performing a fire ritual, Shantigupta, acting as his assistant, made a fewmistakes. Jnanamitra, seemingly infuriated by his actions, hurled burning charcoals athim. At that moment, Shantigupta experienced profound awareness and thereby be-came an adept of highest attainment. He then dedicated himself to the awakening of hisdisciples.2. This set of five distinctions based on students’ characteristics is derived from thecommentarial literature on the Guhyasamaja tantra. Shraddhakaravarman, in his Re-vealing the Seven Ornaments (Toh. 1789, f. 10a4), following Aryadeva’s Clear Lamp Com-mentary [on the Guhyasamaja Tantra] (Toh. 1794), speaks of these five persons who havebeen initiated as causal continuum. On the characteristics of these students, see Chapter16, section entitled “Teachings for Five Types of Recipients.”3. The ground-of-all (kun gzhi, ›laya) is a term often used in reference to the ground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes, ›layavijñ›na) (see Chapter 5, n. 24), which servesas the foundation for the arising of all projected phenomena. In other contexts, ground-of-all refers to reality (de bzhin nyid) or the essence of enlightenment (tath›gatagarbha).See Kongtrul’s Commentary on Differentiating Consciousness from Pristine Awareness, f.23a6-b1.That which is known as the “ground-of-all,” the basis for cyclic existence and perfectpeace, or ultimate dimension of all phenomena, may be divided into two: the pure stateof mind, or ground-of-all pristine awareness; and the impure, or ground-of-all con-sciousness. The ground-of-all pristine awareness is explained to be the essence of en-lightenment and is present mixed with the ground-of-all consciousness, like water andmilk. See CPR, ff. 17a5-19a5.4. The causal continuum is referred to as the “intrinsic original buddha” (rang bzhin gyidang po’i sangs rgyas) and “sudden original buddha” (glo bur gyi dang po’i sangs rgyas)because, on the one hand, the causal continuum is intrinsically or primordially pureand, on the other hand, once the causal continuum is freed from adventitious stains, a“sudden” buddha occurs.5. The four states (gnas skabs bzhi)—waking (sad pa’i gnas skabs), dream (rmi lam gyi -),deep sleep (gnyid stug po’i -), and sexual union (snyoms ’jug gi -)—are obscured in thatthey are dominated by dualistic experience. Through the four seals (phyag rgya, mudr›),the deceptive natures of the four states are gradually purified, and the four states mani-fest as the four dimensions of awakening (see Chapter 9, section entitled “Four States”).The four joys (dga’ ba gzhi, catur›nanda), according to the Kalachakra Tantra, are,one, the joy (dga’ ba, ›nanda) experienced as the moon-like vital essence at the upperpart of the head descends to the throat; two, supreme joy (mchog dga’ ba, param›nanda),experienced as the vital essence descending from the throat reaches the heart; three,special joy (khyad dga’ ba, viram›nanda), experienced as the vital essence descending fromthe heart reaches the navel; and four, innate joy (lhan cig skyes pa’i dga’ ba, sahaj›nanda),experienced as the vital essence descending from the navel reaches the tip of the penis. Inthe ordinary condition, the joys are present as the very nature of the individual’s mind.Experientially, they arise from the melting of the vital essence, which then descends throughthe central channel by means of the inner heat, action seal, and so forth (KedrupNorzang’s Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, f. 194b2-4)."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"The four lights (i.e., stages of experience of light) (snang ba bzhi): light (snang ba,›loka), increase of light (mched pa, ›lok›bh›sa), full culmination of light (nyer thob pa,upalabdha), and luminous clarity (’od gsal, prabh›svara). In the ordinary condition, theseare present as the intrinsic awareness of every being. Experientially, they are elicitedthrough yoga that causes the winds to dissolve in the central channel. Generally speak-ing, lights in the given order are stages of increasing clarity of the mind and mark thedissolution of gross and subtle mentation until luminous clarity is fully manifest. How-ever, the first three stages of light (in the ordinary condition) are also understood as theprogressive deviation from the luminous clarity nature of mind into coarser levels ofdualistic involvement with objects. (See below, Chapter 9, for various ways of positingthe three lights.)6. Evam maya forms part of the expression “Evaô may› Ÿrutam” (’di skad bdag gis thospa), “thus I have heard,” which are the opening words of all sutras and tantras. Evam isthe symbol of all the buddhas; its syllables e and vam represent method and wisdom andare like the father and mother of all the eighty-four thousand aspects of the teachings. Esymbolizes the vowels, and vam, the consonants, which are the bases of words and there-fore the bases of the 84,000 aspects. Evam is stated first in all scriptures. The meaning ofevam is presented from different perspectives; here, the four syllables, e vam ma ya,represent, and resemble in shape, the four channel-wheels (at the head, throat, heart,and navel). The channel-wheel at the navel is represented by, and has the shape of, theletter e; that at the heart, the shape of the letter vam; that at the throat, the shape of theletter ma; and that at the head, the shape of the letter ya. This association is clearly setforth in Vajragarbha’s Commentary Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra (Toh. 1180), vol. Ka,f. 15b5. See also Sönam Tsemo’s SGP, f. 65a1; Gyalwa Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description ofthe Vajra Body, f. 7a5; and Awakened Body, Speech, and Mind Tantra (part of the Ralitantras) (Toh. 388), vol. Ga, f. 207a5.7. The four winds (rlung, pr›òa) are the upward-moving, downward-voiding, fire-ac-companying, and pervading winds. The life wind is omitted presumably because allthese four types of winds express different functions of the life wind.The four vital essences (thig le, bindu) are the vital essences of body (lus kyi thig le,k›yabindu); speech (ngag gi -, v›k-), mind (sems kyi -, citta-); and pristine awareness (yeshes kyi -, jñ›na-). See Chapter 9, section entitled “Winds” and section entitled “VitalEssences.”8. Stains (dri ma) refers to habitual tendencies, which are the source for the deceptiveappearances associated with the four states. Dispersion (’dzag pa) refers to the instabilityor movement of vital essence (thig le) within the body’s channels, as well as its outflowthrough orifices, pores of the skin, and so forth, and principally its emission (’pho ba)through the sexual organs. At a mental level, dispersion occurs owing to concepts (rnamrtog) inherent to the duality of subject and object (Bokar Rinpoché, oral communica-tion). See also Chapter 9, n. 1.9. For the association of these sets of four with the four channel-wheels, see Vajragarbha’sCommentary Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra (Toh. 1180), vol. Ka, ff. 15b3-16a6.The meanings of these sets of four is unclear. According to Bokar Rinpoché, families(rigs, kula) are the elements that constitute the body-mind complex as they emerge fromNOTES TO PAGES 151 TO 152\u0002421"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"422\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAthe single reality of great bliss. In their pure aspects, they are the buddha families. In thiscontext, there are four families corresponding to four channel-wheels. When a differentnumber of channel-wheels is posited (such as six as in the Kalachakra tantra system), thenumber of families varies accordingly. The four tantras (rgyud) refer to the action, con-duct, yoga, and highest yoga tantra systems, which are distinguished according to thepleasures derived from gazing, laughing, hand holding, and sexual union, respectively.The meaning of four beings (’gro ba) remains in doubt; it may refer to the four modes ofbirth—womb birth, egg birth, birth from warmth and moisture, and miraculous birth.It is not clear what the four qualities (yon tan) mentioned here refer to; possibly to thesensory fields for tastes, smells, visual forms, and objects of touch. The four periods(thun tshod) are morning, corresponding to the forehead; midday, to the throat; after-noon, to the heart; and midnight, to the navel (Bokar Rinpoché, oral communication).10. In this context, the four Buddhist philosophies, four original Buddhist schools, fourmoments, four joys, and four truths are being spoken of in a provisional way (drangdon), according to which the four philosophies represent trends of Buddhist thought (grubmtha’, siddh›nta) known as the analyst (bye brag smra ba, vaibh›ýika), traditionist (mdo sdepa, sautr›ntika), idealist (sems tsam pa, cittam›tra), and centrist (dbu ma pa, m›dhyamika).The main view of each of these is represented by the four conceptions mentioned in thetext. For a comprehensive discussion of these philosophies, see Hopkins’s ME.The four schools (sde pa) of followers of the Buddha are the sthavira (gnas brtan pa),the school comprised of those who did not stray from the exalted affinity; sarvastivada(thams cad yod par smra ba), proponents of the theory of the substantial existence of thethree times and the true existence of all things; sammitya (mang po bskur ba), those whofollowed masters respected by many different people; and mahasangika (dge ’dun phalche ba), the school to which most of the monastic community belonged. Explained withrespect to their concealed, or inner, meanings, the four schools stand for the four chan-nel-wheels (’khor lo bzhi, cakra) to which they correspond in ascending order. Like theeighteen branch schools which developed from the four original ones, the four channel-wheels are the source for all the subtle channels that produce vital essence and conse-quently bliss (CH, f. 32a4-b4).The four moments (skad cig ma, kýaòa), posited in relation to an action, are themoment of variety (rnam pa sna tshogs pa, vicitra), moment of fruition (rnam par sminpa, vip›ka), moment of consummation (rnam par rnyed pa, vimarda), and moment thatlacks characteristics (mtshan nyid dang bral ba, vilakýaòa). The beginning of any action,as it initiates conditioned involvement on a variety of levels, is known as the moment ofvariety. Just as a barley seed becomes a barley plant, a particular action will yield a resultconcordant with the cause (rgyu mthun pa’i ’bras bu, ni ̄ýyanda-phalam). The result ofsuch an action, developing through the potential it leaves on the ground-of-all con-sciousness, is known as the moment of fruition. Just as a result develops through avariety of conditions and circumstances, the result of an action does not go unexperi-enced, and thus is a fruition (rnam par smin pa’i ’bras bu, vip›ka-phalam). The repeatedendeavor with respect to the result once it has been experienced is known as the momentof consummation. Like the attainment of awakening through continuous cultivation ofmerit and pristine awareness, such endeavor is a result produced by personal effort (skyesbus byed pa’i ’bras bu, puruýak›ra-phalam). When the result has been fully experienced,"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"there is a moment which is not characterized either by action or by agent, known as lackof characteristics. Such a moment is the result of separation (bral ba’i ’bras bu, visaôyoga-phalam), when, like a burnt seed which can no longer sprout, that which is desired oravoided is exhausted. The four moments, in terms of their inner meanings, are themoments of the four joys. The moment of variety is associated with the joy produced bya variety of means (embracing one’s consort, etc.), that cause the vital essence to descendfrom the head. This joy stops conceptions related to the waking state. The moment offruition occurs when the vital essence reaches the throat and produces the supreme joy.Then, with the slightest effort, bliss increases in intensity. This joy exhausts the dreamstate. The moment of consummation occurs when bliss is repeatedly experienced due tothe mingling of bliss and emptiness at the heart. This joy exhausts the state of deep sleep.The fourth moment, that which lacks characteristics (i.e., not distinguished by passionor lack of passion) occurs when the white and red vital essences mingle with the wind atthe navel, eliciting innate joy. This joy burns away the habitual tendency for the emis-sion of vital essence as regenerative fluid (CH, ff. 29b2-30b2).The four truths are the truth of suffering, the truth of the source of suffering, thetruth of the path, and the truth of cessation, as usually understood in the context ofBuddhist philosophy. In an inner sense, the truth of suffering is the hardship involved inthe quest for undefiled bliss; the source of suffering is the dispersion of the pure vitalessence; the truth of cessation is preventing the outflow of vital essence by means ofwind control techniques and yantra exercises; and the truth of the path is the contempla-tion of clarity and bliss while retaining the vital essence. These truths are associated withthe four channel-wheels in descending order, respectively (CH, f. 32a3-4).The four joys (dga’ ba, ›nanda) represent stages in the experiential process of thetantric path. Joy consists in a slight experience of bliss generated from the melting ofvital essence through the application of graduated methods. Supreme joy is the increaseof that slight joy which overcomes gross discursiveness. Separation from joy, which inthe Kalachakra tantra is known as special joy (khyad dga’), is bliss and emptiness be-coming undifferentiable. As a result of this, attachment to bliss ceases and the extremeof passion is thereby overcome. Innate joy is the unmistaken nonconceptual realiza-tion of the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness which arises through the absence of“passion,” “lack of passion,” and “in-between passion and lack of passion” acting assupport. These are associated with the channel-wheels in descending order (CH, ff.31b4-32a4).On the correspondences between the channel-wheels and the philosophical trends,Buddhist schools, four moments, four joys, and four truths, see Vajragarbha’s Commen-tary Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra (Toh. 1180), vol. Ka, ff. 15b6-16a2.11. The four seals (phyag rgya, mudr›): action seal (karmamudr›), pledge seal(samayamudr›), doctrine seal (dharmamudr›), and great seal (mah›mudr›). These repre-sent the four ways to actualize the pristine awareness of the four joys.These are interpreted differently in the various highest yoga tantras. In the context ofthe Hevajra tantra, in the generation phase, the action seal refers to the initial stage ofyogic practice (still attended by conceptions) which uses attachment in the path. In thiscase, with the aid of a consort, the yogin causes the inner heat at the navel to blaze andthereby experiences the four joys. The joys burn away adherence to the aggregates andNOTES TO PAGE 152\u0002423"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"424\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAelements. By controlling energies, the yogin withholds the vital essence at the genitals,and familiarizes with the unification of nonconceptual bliss and emptiness.For the pledge seal, the yogin contemplates the vowels, consonants, and syllables ofthe five poisons at the channel-wheels of the body in the aspect of the illusory form ofthe deity. Then the yogin draws up the lower winds, causing the inner heat to blaze. Thisburns away adherence to the aggregates and elements, together with the syllables of thefive poisons, and causes the descent of vital essence and the consequent experience of thefour joys. Simultaneously, the yogin meditates on a heruka (i.e., Hevajra) at each spokeof the four channel-wheels, or, alternatively, on a five-colored drop of vital essence ema-nating lights of five colors at each of these points.In the doctrine seal, the yogin, with the understanding of transcendent wisdom taughtin the Buddha’s discourses or through the tantric method of inner heat, contemplatesthe emptiness of the aggregates, sense fields, elements, and so on, which are viewed asthe five buddhas (Vairochana, etc.), their consorts (Lochana, etc.), and so forth. Threelevels of effectiveness are noted: the best is to cognize phenomena, as they arise, freefrom the conceptual elaborations of good, bad, or neutral; the middling is to view themas like a dream or an illusion; and the least, to regard phenomena as Vairochana and hisconsort in union.The great seal is the experience of the inseparability of great compassion and empti-ness free from all extremes, generated by the power of inner heat. Such experience burnsaway all conceptions of cause and result, and nonconceptual pristine awareness arises.The vital essences (at the channel-wheels) radiate immense light, and through the powerof great compassion, the adept emanates various bodies, reaching beings who are fet-tered by the habitual tendencies for dispersion. Such is the specialty of the great seal inthe mother tantras (CH, ff. 34a4-36a1).In the context of the phase of completion, the four seals are explained as follows: Forthe action seal, the yogin elicits, through union with an action seal, actual pristine aware-ness or nonconceptual understanding of reality, which is the undifferentiable unity ofinnate bliss and emptiness.For the seal of the doctrine, the yogin practices the contemplation that directly real-izes the fundamental sameness of flavor (i.e., the union of appearance and emptiness) ofall inner and outer, animate and inanimate phenomena. In such contemplation, theobject of meditation, the meditator, and the meditation are of one flavor, equal in thenature of emptiness. As a result of understanding cyclic life and perfect peace to be ofone flavor, the yogin, free from concepts regarding what to practice and what to aban-don, remains totally absorbed in intrinsic reality. Once the yogin has gained such real-ization, though he may be destitute of merit, or have little potential due to havingcommitted a deed of immediate retribution, he will become accomplished in that samelifetime without any doubt.For the great seal, the yogin contemplates that the environment and all beings arenaturally present pristine awareness, free from all fabrications. Having realized the lackof intrinsic existence as the nature of all things, this contemplation is not a construct ofmind; meditator, meditation, and object of meditation are all beyond fabricated notionsof emptiness, and so forth. Here, the yogin contemplates that all things, from the ani-mate down to blades of grass, regardless of their appearances, are nothing but the verynature of his or her own mind."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"For the pledge seal, the yogin practices in order to gain realization that the threeworlds are, in actuality, the body, speech, and mind of all buddhas of the three times, theinseparability of bliss and emptiness. The continuous cultivation of such realization is thatwhich yields the final result of the achievement of the great seal (CH, f. 122a3-145b4).12. The four indestructible states or vajras (rdo rje bzhi) (body, speech, mind, and pris-tine awareness) represent the primordial condition, or purity, of body, speech, mind,and pristine awareness. These correspond to the manifest, enjoyment, reality, and essen-tial dimensions of awakening, respectively.CHAPTER 8: THE NATURE OF MIND1.

Concerning the authentic condition (gnas lugs) of body and that of mind, GyalwaYang-gönpa explains that the vajra body, speech, and mind of every buddha are theauthentic conditions of ordinary body, speech, and mind. Vajra pristine awareness, whichis the indivisibility of all buddhas’ body, speech, and mind, is the authentic condition ofthe indivisibility of ordinary body, speech, and mind. In this context, vajra means “indi-visibility.” Accordingly, the Equal to the Sky Tantra states: “In all respects, the supremebodies of the buddhas/ And in all respects, the supreme voices and minds of all buddhas/Are one with all animate and inanimate phenomena./ Therefore, they are designated asvajra.” Thus, ordinary body, speech, and mind, and Heruka’s body, speech, and mind areindivisible in terms of the ground, path, and result, and are therefore awakened body,speech, and mind. Moreover, the pristine awareness winds that govern the totality of chan-nels, letters, and vital essences are, respectively, the vajra bodies, voices, and minds of allbuddhas. The channels which resemble a house, the vital essences which resemble wealth,and the winds which resemble the householder are also awakened body, mind, and speech,respectively. Channels are the nature of body; winds are the “body” of speech; and bodhichitta(vital essence), the mind’s support (Secret Description of the Vajra Body, ff. 2b5-3a5).4.

Vitapada explains that profundity (zab mo) denotes that which is free from mistakenconcepts and primordially transcends thoughts and words. Within the [profound] na-ture, stainless like space and devoid of phenomena, manifests the pristine awareness ofclarity. It is free from ideas and associations held by ordinary beings, and so forth, andthus is called profundity beyond scrutiny. What is meant by “clarity” (gsal ba)? Clarity isthat which holds the form of the great seal (mah›mudr›), such as signs (rtags) and othercharacteristics that manifest within that profound state. Such clarity, in nature like anillusion or a rainbow, is the dimension of awakening that has never been born, withinwhich all of one’s own and others’ emotional afflictions are purified. That is called sub-lime clarity (yang dag gsal ba). The inseparability of profundity and clarity is the naturethat is present in everything without distinctions. Unconditioned by the circumstancesof cyclic life, it is called the “ultimate dimension of phenomena” (chos dbyings,dharmadh›tu).

On the outer level, explains Kongtrul, body (in “is present in the body”) refers to theappearances of the three realms which arise as manifestations of innate pristine aware-ness, the essential reality. On the inner level, body refers to the aggregates, elements, andsense fields, or to the body of channels, winds, and vital essences, which are of the natureof the deity. On the alternative level, body refers to the body of the circle of deities of themandala. In all these “bodies,” innate pristine awareness is present. Its nature is not to befound somewhere other than mind nature, which manifests as all these phenomena[bodies]. Such mind nature is one’s own intrinsic awareness; intrinsic awareness is bliss;and bliss transcends all concepts. The variety of its expressions is the manifest dimension(nirm›òak›ya); the clarity of awareness, the enjoyment dimension (sambhogak›ya); thefreedom from conceptual elaborations, the reality dimension (dharmak›ya); and thebliss, the essential dimension (svabh›vikak›ya) of awakening. Hence, innate pristineawareness exists in the nature of the four awakened dimensions (k›ya). It is “great” inthat bliss is sealed by emptiness and emptiness by bliss. Thus, one speaks of “great pris-tine awareness present in the body.”Such pristine awareness is totally devoid of all concepts: the concepts of externalobjects when all things are realized as the “body” of mind; the concepts of subject andobject when the mind is realized as intrinsic awareness; and the concepts of sufferingand indifference when intrinsic awareness is realized as bliss. Like space, it pervades allthings. Although it has primordially abided in the body, pristine awareness has neverarisen as a real object; in the interim, it does not exist as an object apprehended by mind;and in the end, it does not cease when the body dies, just as space in a vase is notdestroyed when the vase is destroyed.NOTES TO PAGES 155 TO 162\u0002427"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"428\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAAccording to the provisional meaning of the passage, and in accordance with itswords, that which is present in the bodies of all ordinary beings, without beginning orend, is great pristine awareness, the very nature of mind, in the manner of a pervadingelement. Its nature has never been defiled by adventitious conceptions; thus, it is freefrom all conceptuality. It is that which pervades all things pertaining to cyclic existenceand perfect peace; although it abides in the body as the pervading factor, it is not pro-duced by the body.When the passage is explained according to its definitive sense but not in accordancewith its words, the body refers to the centers of the four channel-wheels, which are of thenature of wisdom and method embodied in evam. Pristine awareness refers to supreme,immutable, intrinsic awareness, which transcends the luminous clarity experienced inthe generation phase or with the aid of an action seal or imaginary seal. This pristineawareness abides in the body as the pervader, but it is the essence of awakening or theineffable pristine awareness of indivisible bliss and emptiness. It is the pristine awarenessdimension (jñ›nak›ya) and thus pervades all things but is not found outside the minditself. It abides in everything, but, being free from birth and death, does not arise fromthe body.According to its concealed meaning, the body is the vajra body possessing six ele-ments. Great pristine awareness is the innate pristine awareness of the bliss of the melt-ing of vital essence. “Abide” means that it pervades the body. Devoid of conceptualitymeans that at that time, all dualistic conceptions are stopped. That it pervades all thingsmeans that all animate and inanimate things arise in the nature of innate bliss andemptiness. Source: CH, ff. 18a2-20a3.24. Kalachakra Condensed Tantra (Toh. 362), vol. Ka, f. 98a4.25. Bliss in this context has a twofold meaning: the innate bliss of the melted vitalessence (zhu bde lhan skyes kyi bde ba) and the natural innate bliss (rang bzhin lhan skyeskyi bde ba). As to the first, by applying the key instructions, the yogin causes the meltedwhite vital essence of relative bodhichitta to flow to all parts of the body producing afeeling of bliss throughout body and mind. With this serving as the contributory condi-tion, and the familiarity with the nonconceptual pristine awareness of the very nature ofthe mind serving as the primary cause, winds and mind enter and dissolve in the centralchannel. Stimulated by this process, the vital essence (dvangs ma) present in the centralchannel melts. With the gradual ceasing of all layers of the conceptual mind that suchmelting brings about, there arises a clear and limpid pristine awareness which is freefrom any concepts regarding the experience of the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness.Natural innate bliss is the ultimate bliss of luminous clarity, which is the lord thatpervades all phenomena. Why is natural innateness, the emptiness beyond the grasp ofthe mind, said to be bliss? It is bliss because it is free from all suffering and concepts.Moreover, it is posited as bliss since it is free from concepts of arising, abiding, and cessa-tion; since it does not abide in either cyclic life or perfect peace; since it is free from appre-hension of self or others; since it is the pristine awareness of one’s own state; since it pervadeseverything; and since in every circumstance it has the nature of bliss (MH, ff. 92b5-93b5).26. Motility (also translated as passion or creativity) (rdul, rajas); darkness (or immobil-ity) (mun pa, tamas); and buoyancy (or lightness; clarity) (snying stobs, sattva).

Furthermore, in an embodied existence,lightness and motility are the white (khams dkar po) and red constituents (khams dmarpo), or vital essences (thig le), respectively, which permeate and sustain the psychophysi-cal constituents. The coarse aspect of the white constituent is semen (khu ba) and that ofthe red constituent is ovum (khrag).

In the way of the perfections (phar phyin theg pa, prajñ›p›ramit›y›na), it is assertedthat beings in the formless realm do not have form. However, highest yoga tantras(Guhyasamaja, etc., and their commentaries) maintain that beings of that realm do haveform since all sentient beings possess a very subtle body of wind and mind (shin tu phraba’i rlung sems), the very subtle wind being light of five colors. The Kalachakra Tantraand its commentaries assert that beings of the formless realm also possess very subtleparticles of the five elements, as well as a subtle white vital essence (khu ba). Commen-taries on Guhyasamaja and other tantras state that every sentient being possesses theindestructible red and white vital essences of the very subtle wind and mind, alwayspresent without even the briefest moment’s interruption (Kedrup Norzang’s DetailedElucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, ff. 35b2-36a4).30. The Kalachakra Tantra and other tantras teach that the habitual tendency, reinforcedthroughout many lifetimes, for the emission of the white and red constituents (khamsdkar dmar ’pho ba’i bag chags) is the very cause for spinning within cyclic existence. It isonly by means of binding and non-emission of the white and red constituents throughdifferent yogic methods that the state of union of empty form and immutable bliss of abuddha is achieved (Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, f.93a3-4).

As well, a and ham represent the sounds inherent ininhalation and exhalation of the winds through the nose and have the literal meaning of“I am.” N›da is the primordial sound, which has the ability to manifest as the totality ofawakened speech.34. Kongtrul states that what is known as the ground-of-all (kun gzhi, ›laya), the basisfor cyclic existence and perfect peace, or ultimate dimension of all phenomena, may bedivided into two: the pure state of mind, or ground-of-all pristine awareness; and theimpure, or ground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes, ›layavijñ›na). The ground-of-all pristine awareness is explained to be the essence of enlightenment (tath›gatagarbha)and is present mixed with the ground-of-all consciousness, like water and milk. SeeCPR, ff. 17a5-19a5.The ground-of-all attended by stains of the mind (sems), which manifests as appre-hended and apprehender, the afflicted subjective mind (yid), and the sixfold group ofsense consciousnesses (rnam shes tshogs drug), is the foundation of everything attendedby stains, which serves as the root of deception or the ground-of-all consciousness. Thatground-of-all, in terms of being naturally present with a stainless nature though at-tended by the stains of the eightfold group of consciousnesses, is called the essence of thebuddhas or transcendent ones; it is present without change throughout the ground,path, and result. Source: Kongtrul’s Commentary on [Rangjung Dorjé’s] DifferentiatingConsciousness from Pristine Awareness, f. 38a2-4.35. In the eightfold group of consciousnesses (rnam shes tshogs brgyad), the instigativesubjective mind (de ma thag pa’i yid) is included within the afflicted subjective mind(nyon mongs pa can gyi yid), being two aspects of the subjective mind (yid) present in theground-of-all consciousness. Kongtrul isolates the instigative subjective mind as the agentthat serves as the condition for the immediate arising of the six sense consciousnesses. Itis also the agent that, as soon as the six sense consciousnesses cease, serves as the condi-tion for establishing the potencies or seeds of these on the ground-of-all consciousness.Thus, it occurs whenever the six sense consciousnesses arise or cease.The afflicted subjective mind is an aspect of the instigative subjective mind. Theafflicted subjective mind, not recognizing the stainless nature of the mind, focuses onthe ground-of-all, the ultimate nature of mind attended by stains, conceiving of it as aself, grasping it with pride as supreme, cherishing it more than others, and not under-standing it to be unreal; thus, such a mind is always defiled by four emotional afflictions:apprehension of a self, pride, attachment, and ignorance.

Appropriating consciousness (len pa’i rnam shes, ›d›navijñ›na): a synonym for theground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes, ›layavijñ›na) used in the scriptures ofthe universal way.

The primordial indestructible great vital essence (gdod ma’i mi shigs pa’i thig le chenpo), which is the root or ground of all of cyclic life and perfect peace, is known asprimordial (gdod ma) because it has no beginning or end; as indestructible (mi shigs pa)because it is indivisible; as vital essence (thig le) because it pervades the various appear-ances; and as great (chen po) because there is nothing that it does not encompass.There are countless synonyms for the primordial indestructible great vital essence,such as “great seal” (phyag rgya chen po, mah›mudr›), “great bliss” (bde ba chen po,mah›sukha), “primordial sound” (n›da), “all-pervading vajra of space” (mkha’ khyab nammkha’i rdo rje), “ordinary awareness” (tha mal shes pa), “pristine awareness channel” (yeshes kyi rtsa), “pristine awareness wind” (ye shes kyi rlung), “invincible ham” (gzhom medkyi ham), “invincible vital essence” (gzhom med kyi thig le), “essence of enlightenment”(sugatagarbha), and “transcendent wisdom” (shes rab phar phyin, prajñ›-p›ramit›) (CPR,f. 29a3-b2).39. “Other” (gzhan) means that which is apprehended, appearances, objects, and soforth; in reality, simply the intrinsic luminosity or appearing aspect of mind itself. “Self ”(bdag) means the apprehender, mind, or subject; in reality, simply the nature or empti-ness aspect of the mind (CPR, ff. 29b6-30a2).40. For an explanation of how deception occurs with respect to dualistic appearances,see Kongtrul’s CPR, ff. 20a3-21b6.41. Immutable bliss (mi ’gyur bde ba, aksarasukha) refers to nondual awareness, theexpanse of blissful pristine awareness free from mental constructs, which is the unity(gcig tu ’dres pa) of the changeless nature of reality and the bliss of non-emitted vitalessence. Since this great bliss ends the suffering of oneself and others, it is called greatcompassion.In the Kalachakra system, immutable bliss is termed “ultimate” due to the absence ofthe conceptual elaborations of apprehended and apprehender. The empty image com-prehensive of all aspects, the great seal (stong gzugs phyag rgya chen po), is termed “rela-tive” because its appearances are similar to relative phenomena. Nevertheless, immutablebliss and the emptiness comprehensive of all aspects are in fact a single union (IOK, vol.III, pp. 217-221).The habitual tendency for mutable (’gyur ba’i bag chags) bliss refers to the habitualtendency for the emission (’pho ba’i bag chags) of vital essence and particularly its coarseaspect of regenerative fluids.42. Aryadeva specifies the properties and functions of the four elements in this way:Earth is the elemental property of heaviness and solidity. Its action is that of making firmand providing support. Water is moisture or wetness and fluidity. Its action is that ofcohesiveness. Fire is warmth and ripening. Its action is that of drying. Wind is move-ment (extension and contraction, inhalation and exhalation). Its action is that of creat-ing lightness and movement. Source: Lamp Summary of Tantric Practice (Toh. 1803), f.65b1-3.43.

Commenting on these lines, Abhayakara explains that here the pristine awareness ofthe total empty is that of death. The great empty, or culmination of light, refers to themind that has the nature of a gandharva being. Method, the increase of light, denotesthe mind that appropriates [out of ] desire [for existence]. Wisdom, light, refers to themind that has taken birth. From the mind of light, there arises in a progressively moremanifest way the wind produced by karmic actions and other elements. All are of thenature of mind.

Mind (sems), afflicted mind (yid), and sense consciousnesses (rnam shes). Thesethree might be understood as mind, afflicted mind, and perception; or ground-of-allconsciousness, afflicted mind, and the six sense consciousnesses. In the analyst andtraditionist systems, the three terms, mind, afflicted mind, and sense consciousnesses,are considered to be general expressions for the sixfold group of consciousnesses. In thecentrist and idealist systems, these generally refer to the eightfold group of consciousnesses;mind denotes the ground-of-all consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes); mind (yid), theafflicted subjective mind (nyon yid); and consciousnesses (rnam shes), the sixfold groupof sense consciousnesses. See IOK, vol. II, pp. 386-387.47. Kongtrul explains that not recognizing innate pristine awareness of bliss as it is givesrise to cyclic existence, the deceptive appearances of which are devoid of any reality.Sentient beings, who still have the impurities of dualistic grasping, hold perceiver andperceived as being separate and are therefore ignorant of instantaneous innate great bliss.Not recognizing it as present in their own beings and conceiving it to be different is theignorance of taking bliss to be an object. Such ignorance causes a deterioration of thebodhichitta of great bliss, initiating the manifestation of the three poisons of desire,aversion and delusion. Because of this, beings unwillingly spin in cyclic existence. SeeCPR, ff. 115b1-116a6.48. “Blessed” (byin gyis brlabs): the mind entering the nonconceptual state. Accordingly,Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description of the Vajra Body states that in the initial stages of thedevelopment of the body, the being receives the four initiations: The father’s semenstriking the consciousness of the intermediate-state being is the vase initiation. The comingtogether of the white and red constituents as the ovum is enveloped by semen in themother’s womb is the secret initiation. The experience of innate joy is the initiation ofpristine awareness through wisdom. The being’s consciousness becoming unconsciousand entering the nonconceptual state through bliss is the fourth initiation (f. 34a4).49. See Chapter 9, section entitled “The Support for Birth in Cyclic Existence.”CHAPTER 9: THE NATURE OF THE BODY1. According to the Kalachakra tantra, the dispersion (’dzag pa), that results in birth inthe form and formless realms involves the five elements (space, wind, fire, water, and"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"earth) divided into sub-elements (the wind of the space element, etc.), and is of twotypes: physical and mental. The first, physical dispersion, refers to the outflow of vitalessence (bodhichitta). The second, mental defilement (zag pa), refers to obscurationscaused by the discursiveness of emotional afflictions (nyon mongs pa’i rtog pa). Suchdispersion leads to birth in the sixteen levels of the form realm and the four formlessrealms; twenty forms of dispersion determine the particular birth in the correspondingtwenty places. See CPR, ff. 34b5-35b1.The four modes of birth (skyes gnas rnam pa bzhi): womb birth (mngal skyes), eggbirth (sgong -), birth from warmth and moisture (drod gsher -), and miraculous birth(rdzus -). Beings in the desire realm are born through one of these four modes; beings inthe form and formless realms experience miraculous birth only (Stainless Light, vol. Tha,f. 234b1-3). Gods, hell beings, and intermediate state beings experience the miraculousmode of birth; starving spirits experience both womb and miraculous modes; and ani-mals, any of the four modes. Womb birth (as in the case of elephants) is associated withthe fire element; egg birth (as in the case of garudas), with the wind element; warmthand moisture birth (as in the case of butterflies), with the water element; and miraculousbirth, with either the earth element (in the case of ordinary miraculous birth) or spaceelement (in the case of special miraculous birth). See Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Eluci-dation of the Kalachakra Tantra, f. 81a6-b7.2. All six types of beings in the desire realm (gods, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungryspirits, and hell beings) are endowed with the six subtle elements (earth, water, fire,wind, space, and pristine awareness of bliss). Beings in the lower forms of life, gods anddemi-gods, and humans of the continent Unpleasant Sound (sGra mi snyan)—the north-ern one of the four continents of our world-system—are inferior candidates for theindestructible way. This is the case because hell beings are devoid of leisure; and humansin Unpleasant Sound as well as the gods experience mainly the positive results of virtu-ous action done in the past and therefore lack motivation for engaging in virtue andapplying remedies to emotional afflictions, and hence, are not suitable candidates forthe vows of personal liberation. Those who experience the best forms of life are humansof the other three continents (southern, eastern, and western) and, in particular, humansof the Land of Jambu (this world), called the “land of actions” because actions per-formed in this life bear results in the same life. Therefore, these humans are the bestcandidates to receive the key instructions for attaining enlightenment in one lifetimeand in one body. See CPR, ff. 36a4-37a3.3. Hevajra Tantra (Toh. 418), vol. Nga, f. 21b5-7. Reading ’don for don (line 9).4. Kongtrul explains that the reddish walls of the womb which encase the fetus are likethe monastic robes. The mother is like the abbot who instructs and nurtures spiritualgrowth. At the time of birth, the two hands are bent, and the newborn exits withhands folded; this resembles the prostrations done when a monk assumes his vows.After birth, the being performs the actions of the particular class born into, observingthe customs of eating, drinking, and so forth; this resembles someone who, havingbecome a renunciant, observes and trains in the monastic ethical code. As soon as thebeing is born, the sonority of his voice is heard as the sound of syllables a and ham,resembling the repetition of the words of the preceptor in the ordination ceremony.The meaning of aham is the interconnectedness of the inner heat (gtum mo) in theNOTES TO PAGES 166 TO 171\u0002433"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"434\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAshape of the letter a at the juncture of the three channels at the navel area and the purewhite essence resembling the shape of the letter ham at the channel-wheel of great bliss.Moreover, after separation from the womb, the being is naked and without hair on thehead and face, resembling a shaven monk. While reciting the mantra (a haô), the beingis born as a monk; this is the case because “bhikshu” (bhikýu) (monk) means “one wholives on alms” or “one who is liked by his mother, father, and others.” Source: CH, f.253b1-6.Owing to these conditions, humans, who are born endowed with the six psycho-physical elements, exhibit attributes concordant with those of the buddhas (sangs rgyas)and are therefore, without any doubt, buddhas. They are “pure” (sangs) because theimpurities to be forsaken are primordially exhausted, and they are “developed” (rgyas) inbeing complete in all the qualities of the Three Jewels. Not only are beings buddhas butalso they attain higher realizations and renunciations during the ten months spent in thewomb, which represent the ten stages of awakening. On the ten stages, the body, whichis the support for, and which is supported by, the three dimensions of awakening, devel-ops and become firm. Thus, such sentient beings are the lords of the ten stages, andtherefore are called buddhas (f. 253a1-b1).5. Four formless realms (gzugs med bzhi) refers to four levels of absorption (snyoms ’jug):the absorption of infinite space; that of infinite consciousness; that of nothing whatso-ever; and that of neither discernment nor no discernment. The form realm comprisesseventeen heavens grouped according to the four meditative concentrations (bsam gtanbzhi). See Kongtrul’s Myriad Worlds (English translation), pp. 123-126.6. Gods, demi-gods, humans, starving spirits, animals, and hell beings. See Kongtrul’sMyriad Worlds (English translation), ch. 2.7. The sixth element is called pristine awareness or pristine awareness of bliss (bde ba yeshes) and refers to the bliss or pleasure resulting from the release of regenerative fluid(khu ba ltung ba’i bde ba) (CPR, f. 36a3).8. Ovum, literally, blood (khrag). Yang-gönpa, in a similar discussion, in place of semenand blood, speaks of “refined essence” (dvangs ma), which here indicates the male andfemale regenerative fluids (Secret Description of the Vajra Body, f. 5b1).9. Functioning of the channels (rtsa’i kun spyod pa): Discussing this term in the contextof the Kalachakra system, Taranata states that the specifications concerning the six path-ways (three of the life wind and three of the downward-voiding wind), such as the majorchannels that branch off from them, the manner of the flowing of the winds in the sixchannels, and the manner of the flowing of the vital essences in these channels, areknown as the “functioning of the channels” (CSI, f. 45b5).10. The central channel (rtsa dbu ma, avadhát¦) is explained as the basis for the arisingof the vajra body of coarse elements, aggregates, and so on, and subtle channels, winds,and vital essences. It stands straight in the center of the six channel-wheels (cakra), fromthe crown of the head to the secret place. See CPR, ff. 48b6-51a4, for a detailed descrip-tion of the central channel.The Sanskrit avadhát¦ has also been rendered in Tibetan as “all-shaking” (kun ’darma), related to the experience of innate bliss from the movement of bodhichitta withinit. Another meaning of avadhuti is “overcoming negativity” (sdig pa ’jom pa) because it"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"overcomes the negativity represented by dualistic concepts (CSI, f. 37b1-2.) The centralchannel is also known as “devoid of all” (kun spangs ma) since it is free from all dualisticconcepts (CH, f. 21a6).11. Those who assert that there are two central channels say that the meditated centralchannel (sgom pa’i dbu ma) is the domain of experience of the contemplation of theyogin, while the abiding central channel (gnas pa’i dbu ma) is present in the body frombirth until death, after which it dissolves (CPR, f. 49b5).12. The appearance of a black line (re kha nag po) emitting light is one of the signsexperienced by means of the yoga of the day in the specific withdrawal (sor sdud,praty›h›ra) branch of the sixfold yoga (sbyor ba yan lag drug). The black line does appearin other branches as well. The sixth sign in the withdrawal branch is that of an azuresphere (thig le sngon po). In the middle of the sphere is seen a black line, as thin as a hair. Inthe black line, which emits stainless light, is seen the enjoyment dimension (sambhogak›ya)of Vajrasattva with consort, along with myriad forms of the three realms. The empty im-ages and the enjoyment dimension of Vajrasattva in particular constitute the basis onwhich the resultant empty form of Kalachakra in union is attained (Kedrup Norzang’sDetailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, ff. 207a7-b2; 238b4). See also Naropa’s Com-mentary on the Summary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation (Toh. 1351), f. 251a7-b4.The black line, the ten signs, and various other images, which are like illusions orforms seen in a divination mirror, manifest through practice of the yoga of the day andthe yoga of the night and are empty images (stong gzugs). Although they manifest incolors, and so forth, these images, like the magical illusion of the city of gandharvas, arewithout substance. The empty images are simply appearances or reflections of the innatemind of luminous clarity (gnyug ma ’od gsal gyi sems) which is like a limpid sky; they arenot fabricated by the mind but appear by themselves to the yogin. Such a mind ofluminous clarity is beyond dualistic apprehension of phenomena as existent or non-existent. As it is experienced by means of directing the winds into the central channel, itsreflections or images appear like the sun and its sunlight. As the winds increasingly enterthe central channel, the mind of luminous clarity becomes more and more evident, andsigns such as smoke appear (Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation of the KalachakraTantra, ff. 236b4-237b2). See also note 21 of this chapter. For the sixfold yoga, seeChapter 10, n. 37.13. The right channel, known as rasan› (ro ma), and the left channel, lalan› (rkyangma), branch off from the central channel four finger-widths below the navel. They knotthemselves around the central channel at the navel and separate again, then join at thekidneys, coming together at the heart region, where they knot again around the centralchannel. At the throat, they form another knot around the central channel. Again theyseparate and then join at the celestial aperture (tshangs bug) at the crown of the head.From there, the right and left channels bend downward. The right enters the right nos-tril, and the left, the left nostril. Four fingers below the navel, after joining the centralchannel, they extend downward. The lower extremity of the right channel expels men-strual blood in females, and holds and voids fecal waste in both males and females. Thelower extremity of the left channel in both males and females holds and emits urine. SeeCPR, ff. 51a7-52a5. Lalana is so called because it is never satisfied with bliss; rasana,because it determines the experience of various tastes (CH, f. 23a1-3). For a discussionNOTES TO PAGES 171 TO 173\u0002435"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"436\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAof the positions, functions, names, and so forth, of the three channels in the Kalachakrasystem, see Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, ff. 88b2-7;170a1; 202a3-203b2.14. The names of the channels, their positions, and their functions vary from one tantrato the next. The power places (gnas, p¦îha) corresponding to the various channels are alsolisted with different names and enumerated in different ways. For example, theChakrasamvara Tantra lists twenty-four power places; Mah›mudr›tilaka, twenty-eight;and Hevajra, thirty-two. In terms of their outer meaning, the power places refer to spe-cific locations in the Indian subcontinent. They also exist in every region of this worldthat has one million settlements. Abhayakara explains that the channels are called thenames of outer places for purposes of secrecy from unqualified recipients such as theproclaimers (Awn of Esoteric Instructions, Toh. 1198, f. 203a5-6). For the correlationsbetween channels, power places, and yoginis, see MH, ff. 73b1-76b1; Yang-gönpa’s Se-cret Description, ff. 10a6-12a6; Samvarodaya (trans. Tsuda), chs. 7 and 8; IOK, vol. III,pp. 514-515; and Hevajra Tantra (trans. Snellgrove), pp. 68-70.15. The following channels serve as pathways for the five branch winds: victor (rgyal),pathway for the serpent wind (klu, n›ga); victory (rgyal ba), for the turtle wind (rus sbal,kárma); hanging (a lam bu sha), pathway for the lizard wind (rtsangs pa, kækara); ida,also called “ram” (lug), pathway for the gift-of-the-gods wind (lha sbyin, devadatta); andkuha (tshul ’chos pa), pathway for the victorious-in-wealth wind (nor las rgyal, dhanañjaya).See Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation, f. 89b3-5.16. The outer meaning of the parts (cha, kal›), fifteen white (dkar) and fifteen black(nag), is that of the days of the waxing and waning phases of the moon; the innermeaning, the fifteen light moments and fifteen dark moments of the vital essences.According to Longdol Lama, sixteen kinds of vital essences are associated with the six-teen days of the waxing moon, three groups of five vital essences associated with thewaxing moon, plus an aspect of abiding, a total of sixteen. Three groups of five vitalessences are associated with the waning moon, plus the completing aspect of the absenceof moon, a total of sixteen. When, by means of an imaginary or real consort or the greatseal, the inner heat at the secret place blazes, the vital essence descends from the top ofthe head to the line of the hair, giving rise to five moments of joy known as delight (dga’ba, nand›), goodness (bzang po, bhadra), victory (rgyal ba, jay›), void (stong pa, rikt›),and fullness (rdzogs pa, párò›). As the vital essence descends from the line of the hair tothe heart, the same five moments of joy occur. As it descends from the heart to the secretregion, the five moments again occur. At the tip of the penis, the bodhichitta gives rise toinnate bliss, which is distinct from the preceding five joys—the sixteenth moment knownas “full moon.” These are the sixteen moments of joy in descending order. As to theassociation with the sixteen joys in the ascending order, when the vital essence is drawnfrom the tip of the penis back to its center, the five joys occur in a way similar to thosejust mentioned. As the vital essence moves from the center of the penis to the navel, thesame five joys occur; from the navel to the head, the five joys occur again; from the headto the crown of the head, the innate bliss which is not distinct from the five precedingjoys arises—the sixteenth moment known as “absence of moon” (naýîacandra). Theseare the sixteen joys in the ascending order. These sixteen are known as the sixteen kindsof compassion, and the emptinesses of true existence, their objects, are known as the"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"sixteen emptinesses. More precisely, however, these are joys that block material phenom-ena and karmic winds (Longdol Lama’s Kalachakra Tantra’s Sets of Terms According toTsongkapa’s Treatises on the Subject, p. 156). See also Naropa’s Iniziazione di Kalacakra (inItalian), pp. 68-80; 305-308. For the fifteen goddesses or yoginis of the Hevajra mandala,see Hevajra Tantra (trans. Snellgrove), part I, chs. 8 and 9.17. The conch-shell channel (Ÿaºkhin¦) (the lower end of the central channel) increasesbliss and hence is analogous to the waxing phase of the moon. The free-from-demonschannel (m›rad›rik›), states Abhayakara, is fused (’dres pa) to the central channel. Itarises at the navel and extends to the uvula. It draws up vital essence to the uvula and isanalogous to the waning phase of the moon (Awn of Esoteric Instructions, Toh. 1198, f.210a4).18. The channels that serve as pathways for the five root winds are the following: theconch-shell channel, pathway of the downward-voiding wind; noble-hearted (yid bzangma), pathway for the life wind; constellation chariot (snar ma), pathway for the fire-accompanying wind; elephant’s tongue (glang chen lce), pathway for the upward-movingwind; and pale yellow (ser skya), pathway for the pervading wind (Kedrup Norzang’sDetailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, f. 89b3-5).19. For the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening (byang chub kyi phyogs kyi chos sobdun), see Chapter 1, n. 19. The association of these with the channels and goddesses isset forth in Krishnacharya’s Vital Essence of Spring (Vasantatilaka, Toh. 1448, vol. Wa), ff.302b4-303a6, and in an alternative way in Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol. Da, f. 172a1-b7.20. The five hidden channels (sbas pa’i rtsa) are so called because they are hidden (i.e.,not specifically named) in the Chakrasamvara and Hevajra tantras but are clearly setforth in the Kalachakra and because their functions are hidden (CPR, f. 55a4). The fiveare the triple-circle channel (sum skor ma, traivætta); the desire channel (’dod ma, k›min¦);the female-householder channel (khim ma, geh›); the wrath channel (gtum mo, caòçik›);and free-from-demons channel (bdud bral ma, m›rad›rik›).21. The ten signs (rtags bcu), specifically related to the sixfold yoga (ýaçaºga yoga) of theKalachakra tantra, are empty images (stong gzugs) to be meditated upon for the actual-ization of the vajra body. These empty images are not produced by thoughts and areextremely clear. They are the manifestation of pristine awareness, free from subject-object dualism. They resemble space in that they are devoid of mental constructs, be-yond existent and non-existent phenomena. They are the luminous clarity nature ofone’s own mind and also the totality of the dimensions of awakening.Empty images manifest in infinite ways but are explained to be ten in number whenconsidered in terms of their special importance and what they purify. The ten signspertain to the yoga of the day (nyi mo’i rnal ’byor) and the yoga of the night (mtshan mo’irnal ’byor). The four signs of the yoga of the night are smoke (du ba); mirage (smig rgyu);light in the sky (mkha’i snang) resembling fireflies; and blazing lamp (sgron me ’bar ba).The six signs of the yoga of the day are flame (me) (blazing yellow light); moon (zla ba)(blazing white light); sun (nyi ma) (blazing red light); Rahu (sgra gcan) (blazing blacklight); lightning (klog); and great sphere (thig le chen po) (an azure moon globe).

These are called “signs” because theyindicate the presence within oneself of ultimate pristine awareness and because theyconstitute the basis for the confidence that by experientially cultivating the path, onewill be able to actualize pristine awareness.

Being undefiledby external or internal impurities, they are “equal to space.” As they cannot be sym-bolized by concepts of existence or non-existence, they transcend existence and non-existence. They lack intrinsic nature, yet are comprehensive of all aspects, uncreatedand sublime in being utterly devoid of a collection composed of subtle particles. SeeNaropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation (Toh. 1351), ff.259b1-260a5.22. Binding crucial points (gnad bcings) and striking crucial points (gnad du bsnun pa):methods whereby one focuses on major points of the body in order to bring aboutspecific meditative experiences and ultimately the manifestation of pristine awareness.Some methods involve focusing on the channel-wheels and the upper and lower ex-tremities of the central channel. Other methods principally involve focusing on thewinds and vital essences. Through binding crucial points (i.e., binding the functions ofthe body) by means of these special techniques, pristine awareness is manifested. SeeKedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation, ff. 203b7-204a4.23. The channels symbolize (mtshon), or are the purity (dag pa) of, the winds that flow inthem (Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description of the Vajra Body, ff. 6a6-7a1).24. Time conjunction (dus sbyor, lagna): one time conjunction equals 1800 breaths or120 minutes. Twelve time conjunctions equals one solar day.The channel-wheel at the navel is composed of sixty-four channels. The root fourbranch off from the central channel. These are of the emptiness-pristine awareness ele-ment. Each of the root four split into three to make twelve channels. These twelve formthe pathways for the winds of the twelve major transits (’pho chen) (one major transitequals 1,800 breaths, or 120 minutes, or one twelfth of a solar day). Each of these twelvechannels splits into five to make sixty branches (these, plus the four root channels, con-stitute the sixty-four channels of the navel). The sixty channels form the pathways forthe winds of the minor transits (’pho chung) (one minor transit equals 360 breaths, or 24minutes, or one sixtieth of a solar day) or the five elemental mandalas (’byung ba’i dkyil’khor) which flow in the nature of sixty danda measures (dbyu gu) (one danda equals 360breaths, or 24 minutes, or one sixtieth of a solar day). See CPR, f. 56a5-b5.Just as the sun transits the twelve houses of the zodiac (each having five phases) everyday, the winds flow through the twelve “houses” or channels (each having five branches)at the navel channel-wheel every day. Such movement is known as the twelve majortransits and occurs within twelve time conjunctions. Twelve time conjunctions (one"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"day) equals a total of 21,600 breaths. The basic unit of time for the time conjunction isthe breath (inhalation, pause, and exhalation) of a young and healthy person.25. One major session (thun chen po) lasts 2,700 breaths (or 180 minutes; one eighth ofa day). Eight major sessions equals the time of the twelve time conjunctions (dus sbyor),one solar day.26. One transit (’pho ba) lasts 1,350 breaths (or 90 minutes; one sixteenth of a day).Sixteen transits represent a period equal to twelve time conjunctions. “Transits” (lit.“shift”) indicates the sixteen shifts of the winds from one channel to the other of thechannel-wheels at the throat.27. One major clepsydra measure (chu tshod, ghaîik›) is a period of time equivalent to360 breaths (or 24 minutes; one sixtieth of a solar day).28. The navel channel-wheel, yellow in color, is known as “emanation wheel”(nirm›òacakra); the blue channel-wheel at the heart, “reality wheel” (dharmacakra); thered channel-wheel at the throat, “enjoyment wheel” (bhogacakra or sambhogacakra); andthe white channel-wheel in the upper part of the head, “wheel of great bliss”(mah›sukhacakra). See CH, ff. 28b4-29a3; 250b3-253a2.29. The channels that form the heart channel-wheel are the eight channels associatedwith the planets (gza’). The channel “chariot constellation” (snar ma) is associated withthe Sun; the channel “elephant tongue” (glang chen lce), with the Moon; the channel“pale yellow” (ser skya), with Mars; the channel “victor” (rgyal), with Mercury; the chan-nel “victory” (rgyal ba), with Jupiter; the channel “hanging” (’phyang ba), with Venus;the channel “ram” (lug), with Saturn; and the channel “contriver” (tshul ’chos pa), withKetu. See also the discussion on the heart channel-wheel in Wayman’s The BuddhistTantras, pp. 152-163.30. One danda measure is equal to 360 breaths or 24 minutes, or one sixtieth of a solarday.31. The twelve channel-wheels in the twelve major joints each have thirty channel-spokes, for a total of three hundred and sixty. The sixty channel-wheels in the minorjoints also have a total of three hundred and sixty channel-spokes. These, in their pureaspect, correspond externally to the three hundred and sixty days in the twelve monthsof the year, and alternatively to the three hundred and sixty deities of the mandala ofawakened body and the vowels and consonants.

The Buddha states that there are twenty main channels in the body,five in front, five in the back, five in the left, and five in the right. Each of these has fortyminor branches, and from each of the branches, one hundred secondary channels branchoff, a total of 80,000 (f. 241a4-6).38. Chanting the Names of Manjushri (Toh. 360), f. 3a3.39. Yang-gönpa explains that at the moment of conception, the consciousness of the inter-mediate being (in the shape of the letter a), accompanied by the pervading wind, is envel-oped by the father’s semen and subsequently by the mother’s ovum. The union of thesethree elements remains at the navel. At the time of birth, the three elements of such unionseparate. The white essence from the father’s semen moves upward in the central channeland settles at the crown of the head (in the shape of the letter ham) and is held there by thepower of the left channel, lalana. The red vital essence from the mother’s ovum or “blood”descends to the secret place at the lower extremity of the central channel and is held thereby the power of the right channel, rasana. The pervading wind diffuses throughout thewhole body, and the other winds start to flow through the nostrils with the sound of aham.The mind moves to the heart. Source: Secret Description of the Vajra Body, f. 26b7-27a3.40. In this view, the inner level (the body) corresponds to the outer level (the externalworld). For an explanation on how the body, in its initial formation, life, and death,exists as method and wisdom, see Gyalwa Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description, ff. 96b1-97a2.41. In the center of the channel-wheel at the heart is a knot formed by three channels.This knot is in the shape of the letter hum. It is slightly bound and surrounded by the"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"tips of the great bliss channel and the enjoyment channel. Inside the knot are four spokeswhich have knots in the shape of the four letters bhrum, am, kham, dzim. In their centeris a channel whose knot is in the shape of the letter hum. These five are the seeds of thefive emotional afflictions and are called the “five hidden channels.” Their purity repre-sents the buddhas of the five families (Gyalwa Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description, f. 13a).The syllable hum stands for Akshobhya, and is the seed of the emotional affliction,or “poison,” of aversion and serves as the support for urine. The syllable bhrum standsfor Vairochana, and is the seed of delusion and serves as the support for feces. Thesyllable am stands for Ratnasambhava and is the seed of pride and serves as the supportfor blood. The syllable dzim stands for Amitabha and is the seed of desire and serves asthe support for semen. The syllable kham stands for Amoghasiddhi and is the seed ofjealousy and serves as the support for human flesh. This correspondence is set forth inPundarika’s Stainless Light Commentary, vol.

One minor clepsydra measure (chu srang, p›nip›la)is a period of time equal to six breaths or twenty-four seconds. For danda measure, seenote 30 of this chapter. For time conjunction, see note 24 of this chapter.46. At conception, the ground-of-all consciousness of the intermediate being enters thewomb drawn by the afflicted mind (nyon yid) attended by various habitual tendencies.This consciousness is of the nature of wind and is thus called “subtle wind of five-colored light.” See CPR, f. 40a4-6.47. The life wind (srog ’dzin, pr›òa), source of all ten winds, is present in all parts of thebody, right out to its hair pores, but is based in the central channel, upon which allchannels depend, and dwells right in the center of the body. It is connected to andsupports the ground-of-all. During life, this wind generates the conception of self andall conceptual constructs and is known as the afflicted mind.The downward-voiding wind (thur du sel ba, ap›na) dwells below the navel where thethree main channels meet and flows downward. Its function is to regulate the voiding orwithholding of refined and residual constituents such as feces, urine, semen, and blood.The fire-accompanying wind (me dang mnyam du gnas pa, sam›na) arises from theconstellation chariot channel at the heart and is connected to the stomach. Its functionis to digest food and drink, separate the refined elements from the residual, conveyrefined nutrients throughout all the channels, thereby nourishing and strengthening theorganism, and ridding it of impurities.The upward-moving wind (gyen du rgyu ba, ud›na) arises from the elephant’s tonguechannel at the heart. It presides over the functions of the throat, swallowing food andNOTES TO PAGES 175 TO 177\u0002441"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"442\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAdrink, and so forth, the movements of arms and legs, such as walking, and the activitiesof speech, talking, singing, and so forth.The pervading wind (khyab byed, vy›na) flows through the pale yellow channel con-nected to the rasana. It dwells in all joints of the body. Its function is to give strength tothe body to allow stretching, contracting, and so forth.For a detailed discussion of these winds, see CPR, ff. 68b6-70a5. There are numerousdiscrepancies from one tantra to the next concerning the locations, colors, elements, andbuddhas associated with the root and branch winds.48. The five branch winds—serpent wind, turtle wind, lizard wind, gift-of-the-godswind, and victorious-in-wealth wind—are also known by the alternative names of mov-ing (rgyu ba), moving thoroughly (rnam par rgyu ba), moving perfectly (yang dag rgyuba), moving strongly (rab tu rgyu ba), and moving resolutely (nges par rgyu ba); or knownas winds of the five goddesses (lha mo lnga’i -); or winds of the five faculties (dbang polnga’i -). They serve as the mounts for the eye sensory consciousness, ear sensory con-sciousness, and so on, respectively. They are red, blue, yellow, white, and green, respec-tively (Longdol Lama’s Sets of Terms Derived from the Awareness-Holder Collection of SecretMantra, p. 234).Concerning these winds, Gyalwa Yang-gönpa explains that the serpent wind dwellslike a serpent in the intestines. It causes all diseases, and therefore is called serpent. Theturtle wind dwells like a turtle in the liver. It determines contraction and extension oflimbs and therefore is called turtle. The lizard wind dwells like a lizard in the lungs. Itcauses anger and agitation, hence is called lizard. The gift-of-the-gods wind dwells like adivine gift in the heart. It produces excitement and desire, hence is called gift-of-the-gods. The victorious-with-the-bow (alternative name for the victorious-in-wealth wind)dwells like a bow in the kidneys. It produces sneezing and maintains life and thus iscalled victorious-with-the-bow (Secret Description of the Vajra Body, ff. 19b-20b).Kedrup Norzang specifies that the serpent wind, turtle wind, lizard wind, gift-of-the-gods wind, and victorious-in-wealth wind originate in the victor channel, victorychannel, alambusha channel, ida channel, and kuha channel, respectively. These chan-nels also serve as their principal locations. However, these five winds are found through-out all the channels of the body (Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, f. 91b5-6).In the Kalachakra system, the ten winds are not distinguished as root and branch(Changkya Rolpai Dorjé’s Concise Presentation of Channels, Winds and Vital Essences Ac-cording to the Kalachakra System, p. 243).49. The indestructible wind (mi shigs pa’i rlung), the root of all pristine awareness winds,and the great life wind (srog rlung), the root of all karmic winds (las rlung), are mixed,like water and milk, in the Rahu wind, which may therefore be called “life wind” since itsustains life (CPR, f. 50b4-5).50. As well, these qualities characterize the three principal channels: buoyancy charac-terizes lalana (the left channel); motility, rasana (the right channel); and darkness,madhyama (the central channel).51. Elemental transformation (’byung ’gyur) usually refers to the seven qualities of touch(smooth, rough, heavy, light, cold, hunger, and thirst) arising from the transformationof the four elements. Here, however, the term refers to the five sense objects: visual"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"forms, odors, tastes, and so forth, which are also transformations or combinations of theelements.52. The great life wind is already present at the time of conception. In the second month,the downward-voiding wind emanates from the life wind. In the third month, the up-ward-moving wind emanates from the life wind. In the fourth month, the pervading windemanates from the life wind. In the fifth month, the fire-accompanying wind emanatesfrom the life wind. Then, the branch winds start to emanate—the serpent wind in thesixth month, the turtle wind in the seventh month, the lizard wind in the eighth month,the gift-of-the-gods wind in the ninth month, and the victorious-in-wealth wind in thetenth month. See CPR, ff. 42b5-45b1, for an extensive discussion of these winds.The dissolution of these winds, from the perspective of a life span of one hundredyears, begins in the tenth year after birth with the vanishing of the victorious-in-wealthwind into the gift-of-the-gods wind. Thus, every ten years, the potency of a wind dis-solves (CPR, f. 67b2-3).53. Like a king, the great life wind, the nature of the Rahu element, dwells in the centralchannel from its formation in the mother’s womb until death. Like ministers, the rootand branch winds emanate from the great life wind and perform specific functionsthroughout the body (CPR, f. 71b2-4).54. Kedrup Norzang explains that, according to the Kalachakra system, in each of theeight channels at the heart channel-wheel, winds flow 2,700 times (for a total of 21,600times daily). This figure includes the 675 movements of pristine awareness winds, whichoccur 56.25 times between each major period (Detailed Elucidation of the KalachakraTantra, f. 97a2-b3). The winds of the natures of the five elements flow inward (duringinhalation) through the right and left nostrils in the order of generation of the elementsand of birth (from space, wind arises; from wind, fire; from fire, water; and from water,earth) and flow outward (during exhalation) in the order of dissolution and of death(from earth, water; and so on).55. The Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, and other tantras speak of thirty-two channel-spokesat the head channel-wheel, associated with the union of method and wisdom. Fromanother perspective, the sixteen outer spokes carry mainly the red vital essence, and thesixteen inner, the white vital essence and winds. Thus, the Kalachakra system speaks ofsixteen spokes at the head. As to the actual mode of circulation of the winds in thesechannels according to the Kalachakra system, see CPR, ff. 72a4-73a2.56. Period (yud tsam): a measure used in the Kalachakra system equal to two dandameasures (dbyu gu). One danda measure is equivalent to 360 breaths; a period (yud tsam)is therefore a time equal to 720 breaths (or 48 minutes; one thirtieth of a day) (Abhayakara’sAwn of Esoteric Instructions, Toh. 1198, f. 202a2).The Hevajra, Chakrasamvara, and other tantras speak of sixteen channel-spokes inthe throat channel-wheel, while the Kalachakra speaks of thirty-two (sixteen pairs ofmethod and wisdom). According to the system of thirty-two spokes, the aspect of pris-tine awareness-emptiness flows in four spokes, and winds that move in accordance withthe course of the twenty-eight constellations flow in the other twenty-eight. Accordingto the system of sixteen spokes, the winds of the sixteen transits flow in these sixteenspokes. See CPR, f. 73a4-b5.NOTES TO PAGES 177 TO 178\u0002443"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"444\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA57. See note 24 of this chapter. For a detailed discussion of the movement of wind at thenavel channel-wheel, see Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation, ff. 93b5-96a1.58. In one year, the sun transits the twelve houses (khyim, raýi)—Aries, Taurus, Gemini,Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces—thatexert the most influence, both positive and negative, on the affairs of the world. Like-wise (internally), in one day, the wind moves through the twelve (inner) houses (groupsof channels at the navel). Externally, the sun transits one house in 1,800 danda measures(dbyu gu) (one danda equals 24 minutes; 1,800 danda equals 30 days); internally, thewind moves 1,800 times for each sign of the zodiac.59. From the mandalas or elements at the navel, the winds flow through the right andleft channels up to the right and left nostrils from where they are exhaled and theninhaled to return to the navel. The winds exhaled are predominantly karmic winds,which flow in the left and right channels. These karmic winds constitute the five rootand five branch winds, so called in terms of the functions they perform in the body (IK,pp. 251-252). Kedrup Norzang explains that the greater the distance reached by thewinds during exhalation, the shorter the distance reached on inhalation (and the con-verse). The wind of the space element reaches the center of the navel; that of the windelement, one fingerwidth below the navel; that of the fire element, two fingerwidthsbelow the navel; that of the water element, three fingerwidths below the navel; and thatof the earth element, four fingerwidths below the navel. Then, they are exhaled again(Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, f. 98b5-6).In addition to the nostrils, wind has other pathways through which to exit the body,such as the pores of the skin in a subtle way and the doors of the senses in a coarse way(CPR, f. 76a1-2).60. According to ancient Indo-Tibetan cosmology, the external world comes into beingbeginning with the space element (empty particles left after the destruction of a previousworld-system), followed by wind, fire, water, and lastly, the earth element. At the end ofthe era of abiding, the world starts to disintegrate in the opposite order. Because thewind that flows in the right nostril follows the sequence of disintegration (beginningwith the wind of earth) of the external world, it is called “poison wind.” Because thewind that flows in the left nostril follows the sequence of the arising (beginning with thewind of space) of the external world, it is called “nectar wind” (CH, f. 33a3-b1).61. Like Rahu, which causes solar and lunar eclipses, this wind overshadows the karmicwinds that flow in the right and left channels.62. Half of the pristine awareness wind, together with the wind of the time conjunc-tions, flows outward, causing exhaustion of life; half, together with the power of longev-ity, flows in the central channel, increasing life and pristine awareness, as well as enhancingthe power of longevity (CPR, ff. 78b6-79a1).63. Kedrup Norzang states that each of the twenty-four constellations is divided intofour parts; each of these is called a phase, literally, “foot” (rkang). Nine such phasesconstitute a house (khyim) or time conjunction (dus sbyor) (Detailed Elucidation of theKalachakra Tantra, f. 50b4-5).64. See CPR, ff. 78b6-79a4."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"65. The signs of premature death called “signs of the moon” occur in relation to thelunar and feces channels; and those called “signs of the sun,” in relation to the solar andurine channels. Such signs are determined by the malfunctioning of the life wind anddownward-voiding wind in these channels due to their flowing beyond measure. Signsof premature death do not occur in relation to the channels of darkness and the descentof semen. Malfunction in these occurs gradually and leads to a natural death (Taranata’sCSI, f. 35a6-b3).66. For a being possessed of a vajra body, in the course of a life that lasts for one hundredyears, winds move seven hundred and seventy-seven million six hundred thousand times,of which twenty-four million three hundred thousand are movements of the pristineawareness wind. Thus, the pristine awareness wind flows for a total of 1,125 days, i.e.,three years and three fortnights. When a year is calculated on the basis of the lunar day(which is shorter than the solar one), the period amounts to three years, two months,and a little more than two days, but the expression “three years and three months” isused because at the end of that time, the lunar phase of the next month, the third, hasalready began.67. These topics are presented in CPR, ff. 79b5-87a2.68. For an extensive discussion, see CPR, ff. 87a2-88a3.69. Reading skyod for spyod. See CPR, f. 87a2-6.70. When the ultimate nature of the mind (sems nyid), pristine awareness, or root inef-fable vital essence (rtsa ba spros bral gyi thig le), is not directly recognized, the deceptionof ignorance arises. The vital essences of substance, mantra, and wind are the remediesto such deception. See Kongtrul’s CPR, ff. 89a6-90b5.71. Rangjung Dorjé states that the vital essence of substance comprises an outer vitalessence contained within the outer world and an inner vital essence contained withinthe vajra body (CPR, f. 91a1-2).Kedrup Norzang explains that the vital essence of substance is generally distinguishedas white and red (thig le dkar dmar). Thirteen months after conception in the womb, thetwo essences begin to develop and continue the process of development until the male issixteen and the female twelve years of age. At the age of twelve for a female, the red vitalessence emerges as the ovum through the uterus; at the age of sixteen for a male, the vitalessence can be ejaculated as semen through the penis. In general, the white and red vitalessences abide in and pervade, like oil in sesame seeds, all parts of the body. The whitevital essence abides mainly in the channel-wheel of great bliss at the crown of the head;and the red vital essence, mainly in the channel-wheel at the secret place and the chan-nel-wheel at the navel. Moreover, the white vital essence abides in and emerges from theleft channel, lalana. The red vital essence abides in and emerges from the right channel,rasana. Both white and red vital essences emerge as fluid from the conch-shell channelor “supreme” channel located below the navel (Detailed Elucidation, f. 92a2-6).72. In form, the white aspect resembles an upside-down ham, mustard seed size. It iswhite, shiny, limpid, and shimmering with great radiance, emitting light like a pure crystalsphere. Acquired from the refined white vital essence of the father, the best of vital es-sences, it is the nature of the male heruka and the method of great bliss (CPR, f. 91b3-5).NOTES TO PAGES 178 TO 181\u0002445"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"446\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA73.

The second line of this passage in theDergé Kangyur reads tsam in place of lta bur as in IOK; the fifth line reads rgod gdong mame ngo bo nyid in place of me ni chen po’i gzugs kyis ni.78. In his auto-commentary on these lines, Krishnacharya states that at the heart of allbeings is a wheel of phenomena with anthers and corolla, a channel-wheel with eightpetals existing in the nature of the eight pure periods of day and night. At the center ofthis wheel is the triple-circle channel (sum skor ma, traivætt›), the lower face resemblinga plantain flower, luminous like the flame of a sesame oil lamp.In the center of that, ready to melt like morning frost as the rays of the sun strike, isthe letter hum, half the size of a small mustard seed. Being inexpressible, it is invincible.Being devoid of any fear with respect to any conceptually created phenomena, it is calledhero. Resembling the season of spring which gladdens the heart of all creatures, it iscalled spring (dpyid). It is the blessed Heruka to be realized, not the one with four facesand twelve arms. Fanned by karmic winds that have the characteristic of the perfectunion of the male and female, the fire of pristine awareness, which resembles the fire ofthe Mare-Head Mountain Range, blazes at the navel. Moving in the upward directioncauses the spring flow of nectar of the syllable hum to descend, which melts that fire.Because they join in an inseparable union, it is said that they rest in union. Such isknown as “vital essence of spring.” This, in the Vasantatilaka, is indicated with thewords “...Heruka.” The syllable hum, which has the characteristics just described, isHeruka. Because it blazes with pristine awareness, it is V›r›h¦, the vital essence (thigle). Source: Extensive Commentary on the Vital Essence of Spring (Toh. 1449), vol. Wa, f.324b1-4.Perfect awareness (yang dag rig pa) in the form of fire is the woman of wisdom (shesrab ma), naturally present, like the moon and its light. In this context, V›r›h¦ (phag mo,sow) means the following: in v›r›h¦, va stands for v›yu (wind, rlung) and V ¦tihotra (thefire god, Byin za); r› stands for r›mat¦ (“giver of joy,” dga’ bar byed), since through theaction of wind and fire, the ham melts and drips, causing joy.

Indestructible Seat (rdo rje gdan, vajråsana): the place of awakening for all buddhas,known as the ground for the essence of awakening (byang chub snying po’i gzhi). Like-wise, these two vital essences, white and red, are the ground for actualizing the inner stateof union (CPR, f. 92a6-b1). In our world, the Indestructible Seat refers to the place wherethe Buddha awakened, located in present-day Bodhgaya in the state of Bihar in India.80. Kedrup Norzang states that at the head, at the center of the penis, and at its tipabides mainly the white vital essence, with the red vital essence also present minimally.The white vital essence that is the very basis for the increase of all white vital essence islocated at the head. At the center of the channel-wheels at the navel, throat, and secretplace abides mainly the red vital essence, with the white one also found in those places insmall proportion. At the center of the channel-wheel at the heart, the white and red vitalessences abide in equal measure. According to the Indestructible Garland Tantra, the vitalessences located in those places of the body are the size of mustard seeds and are mixturesof white and red vital essences (Detailed Elucidation, ff. 204b5-205a6).81. The residual elements of the two original refined vital essences (located at the headand below the navel) have two aspects, residual and refined. The refined aspect also hastwo aspects, the red and the white. The red aspect or solar constituent (nyi ma’i khams),the nature of blood, is produced by the heat of the short a at the navel and ascendsthrough the right channel. The white vital essence (thig le dkar po) descends from theham at the head, moving through the left channel. The residual part of the residual isexpelled in coarse form (CPR, f. 92b2-4). For a discussion of vital essence in relation to theelements of the body, see Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description of the Vajra Body, ff. 26a4-27a6.82. The orifices are usually listed as nine: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, theanus, and the urinary tract. Some add the uvula extremity and the upper and lower endsof the central channel (Longdol Lama’s Kalachakra Tantra’s Sets of Terms, p. 164).83. Here, inner fire offering (nang gi sbyin sreg) refers to the ingestion of food and drinkas an offering to one’s psychophysical constituents as deities (fashioned on the outer fire-offering ritual). The nutrients of the food ingested, according to the system of Tibetanmedicine, go through a sevenfold process of refinement to become, in turn, blood, flesh,fatty tissue, bones, marrow, and regenerative fluids. At each step of this process, throughthe action of metabolic heat, the refined essences are separated from residual, or waste.The end result of this cycle is the refined essence known as the regenerative fluids (khuba, Ÿukra). Regenerative fluids have a coarse and fine component. The coarse compo-nent becomes semen in males and ovum in females, and the fine part flows from theheart to the entire body through a network of manifest vessels and nerves and less mani-fest pathways, giving radiance and strength to the body. See also CPR, ff. 92b6-94a3.84. The four refined vital essences (dvangs ma) are connected to the eye, ear, nose, andtongue consciousnesses through the channels at the heart where the branch winds flow.They serve as the principal conditions for the apprehension of the four objects, visualforms, and so forth. The fifth, the white refined vital essence that comes through thefree-from-demons channel (where the gift-of-the-gods wind flows) ascends and entersthe uvula, where it is reversed, and, hence, is obscured. This channel and the vital es-sence within it serve as conditions for one aspect in the experience of objects of touch(CPR, f. 94a5-b5).NOTES TO PAGES 181 TO 183\u0002447"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"448\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA85. For an explanation of the twenty-four channels, their functions, and associationwith outer power places and deities, see CPR, ff. 96a5-99b2. According to Krishnacharya(Kanha), the sky-farers who gather in these places are known as yoginis of the sky, of theearth, and of the netherworld because they are associated with the upper, middle, andlower points of the body, respectively (Extensive Commentary on the Vital Essence of Spring,Toh. 1449, vol. Wa, f. 326a3).86. Gyalwa Yang-gönpa states that power places (gnas) and related power places (nye ba’ignas) correspond to the channels pervaded by vital essences that are not subject to in-crease and decrease, and that are refined at one time and residual at another. Fields(zhing) and related fields (nye ba’i zhing) correspond to the channels where the whitevital essence increases and expands. Meeting places (tshan dho ha) and related meetingplaces (nye ba’i tshan dho ha) correspond to the channel junctions for the red vital es-sence. Assembling places (’du ba) and related assembling places (nye ba’i ’du ba) corre-spond to the channels in which vital essence assembles. Charnel grounds (dur khrod)and related charnel grounds (nye ba’i dur khrod) correspond to channels in which theflow of the vital essence is stopped or occasionally interrupted. Places of drinking (’thungspyod) and related places of abstinence from drinking (nye ba’i ’thung gcod) correspondto channels in which the vital essence produces a sensation and those in which it doesnot produce a sensation (Secret Description of the Vajra Body, f. 12a6-b1). See also MH, f.76a1-4.87. The vital essences, or bodhichitta, white and red, shift to different places of the bodyin a daily cycle, monthly cycle, annual cycle, and life cycle. In the monthly cycle,bodhichitta engages in its active function in the place where it is situated on a particularday. In the place where it was situated the preceding day, there is a residue known as thedissolved part. In the place where the bodhichitta will be the next day, there is already itsdominant aspect in the growing phase. The cycle begins on the first day of the lunarmonth when the vital essence is at the tip of the big toe (of the left foot in males andright foot in females). This is so because the male vital essence is predominant in thewhite essence and thus flows through the left channel. The female vital essence is pre-dominant in the red essence; thus, it flows through the right channel. On the secondday, the residue of the vital essence dissolves at the big toe, and at the same time the vitalessence is performing its active function at the ankle. Its dominant part shifts to the calfwhere the vital essence will be active on the third day.According to treatises on astrology, the vital essence shifts daily to a different locationof the body: in the case of a female, it moves from the right toe to the ankle, then to theanterior part of the knee, to the posterior part of the knee, to the lateral side of the thigh,to the hips, to the region above the kidneys, to the ribs, to the shoulder and upper arm,to the medial forearm, to the palm of the hand, to the neck, to the temples, up to thefifteenth lunar day, when it pervades the entire body. On the sixteenth day, it descendsto the temples, and so forth, on the left side of the body to reach the top of the foot onthe twenty-ninth day of the lunar month and pervade the entire body on the thirtieth.For a clear description of the various cycles of the vital essence, see Gyalwa Yang-gönpa’s Secret Description, ff. 27b6-30b2.88.

Kedrup Norzang states that the vital essences of body, speech, mind, and pristineawareness (lus ngag sems ye shes kyi thig le) are equivalent to the vital essences of awakenedbody, speech, mind, and pristine awareness (sku gsung thugs ye shes kyi -); and to the vitalessences that produce the four states (gnas skabs bzhi skyes pa’i -) (Detailed Elucidation, ff.204b3-205a1).Two sets of vital essence determine the four states. Four are situated in the upper partof the body, and four, in the lower. At the center of the channel-wheel at the head, thevital essence of the body, or awakened body, determines the waking state. At the throat,the vital essence of speech, or awakened speech, determines the dream state. At theheart, the vital essence of mind, or awakened mind, determines the deep sleep state. Atthe navel, the vital essence of pristine awareness determines the fourth state, orgasm.These vital essences depend on the life wind.The four kinds of vital essence situated in the lower part of the body are as follows: atthe navel, the vital essence of the waking state (thus, the vital essence at the navel has twopotencies: one for the waking state; the other for orgasm); at the base of the genitals, thevital essence of the dream state; in the middle part of the penis, the vital essence of deepsleep; and at the tip of the penis, the vital essence of orgasm.In the ordinary condition, deep sleep occurs when coarse winds collect at the centerof the penis and at the heart. The dream state occurs for a prolonged length of time asthese winds spread to the base of the secret place and throat. When the winds reach thenavel and the head, the waking state occurs, accompanied by manifold appearances.Orgasm occurs as the vital essences, through the force of sexual intercourse, melt andreach the navel and the tip of the penis, producing a blissful sensation greater than whenthey reach other spots of the body.Moreover, each of these vital essences is endowed with a double potency. For ordi-nary beings, the vital essence at the head and at the navel produces the waking state,accompanied by the countless conceptual constructs of daily life; at the time of enlight-enment, however, the potency of the vital essence creates countless emanations of awak-ened form (nirm›òak›ya). Similarly, in the ordinary condition, the vital essence locatedat the throat and at the base of the genitals produces dreams; at the time of enlighten-ment, it produces the speech of the enjoyment dimension (sambhogak›ya), in all itsaspects. The vital essence located at the heart and in the center of the penis, the potencyof which in ordinary beings causes the unconscious state characteristic of deep sleep, atthe time of enlightenment is the source of the dimension of reality (dharmak›ya), ornonconceptual awakened mind, free from all limitations imposed by mental constructs.The vital essence located at the navel and at the tip of the penis, the potency of which inordinary beings is the source of the blissful experience when semen is emitted, at thetime of enlightenment produces the dimension of bliss (sukhak›ya), or the supreme,immutable, state of bliss.Thus, in the ordinary condition, the potencies of the vital essences that produce thefour states of waking, dream, deep sleep, and orgasm produce the manifold impureappearances; the manifold deceptive expressions of speech; the nonconceptual yet un-clear deep sleep; and the bliss of emission, respectively.The deception-creating potencies of the vital essences are cleansed by using as expe-riential means the potency that creates various appearances, the potency that createsNOTES TO PAGES 183 TO 184\u0002449"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"450\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAvarious sounds, the potency of remaining in a nonconceptual state, and the potency toexperience sexual bliss. At the time of the path, such experiences become empty forms,invincible sounds, nonconceptual consciousness, and immutable bliss. As the fruition ofthe process of cleansing, the four states transform into the various manifestations ofawakening (nirm›òak›ya), the totality of speech of the enjoyment dimension(sambhogak›ya), the nonconceptual dimension of reality (dharmak›ya), and the dimen-sion of great immutable bliss and pristine awareness (mah›sukhak›ya).The obscurations of the vital essences that produce the four states are the very sourceof all obscurations. These vital essences are asserted by most outstanding supreme schol-ars to be matter. The imprints of obscurations accumulated from beginningless time arepresent within the matter that constitutes the vital essences, that of a union of verysubtle mind and wind. These imprints produce the emotional and cognitive obscurations.In the Kalachakra system, the impurities or deception-creating potencies that stain thesevital essences are purified and their potencies to produce the four dimensions of awaken-ing are actualized through the phase of creation and the phase of completion consistingof the sixfold yoga, and so on.

These topics are presented in CPR, ff. 107a2-120b2.92. The tantric system speaks of a subtle body (phra ba’i lus) which is based upon thecoarse body of psychophysical constituents. As to its nature, Kongtrul explains that thesubtle body denotes mind nature accompanied by the white vital essence, red vital es-sence, and wind. Nothing (except for the adamantine contemplation of one who isabout to awaken) can destroy that body, and for this reason it is called the “indestruc-tible vital essence of consciousness” (rnam shes kyi mi shigs pa’i thig le) (CPR, f. 32a5-6).93. Supreme immutable bliss (mchog tu mi ’gyur ba’i bde ba): see Chapter 8, n. 41.Kedrup Norzang equates the innate body with the very subtle wind (shin tu phra ba’irlung) which is undifferentiable in nature from the very subtle mind (shin tu phra ba’isems). The union of subtle wind and subtle mind in the state of conditioned existence isthe very root of beings’ psychophysical constituents. All phenomena of conditionedexistence are but manifestations of the very subtle mind and wind. At death, all appear-ances dissolve into these two. An experienced yogin, by working on the channels, winds,and vital essences, brings about the three-stage experience of light and the luminousclarity of mind and attains the final mind-isolation (sems dben mthar thug pa), which isthe actualization of the subtle wind and mind.

The union of e and vaô is posited in relation to thirty-seven constituents. Thirty-sixconstituents (the aggregates, elements, and so forth) form the sphere of pervasion. Thethirty-seventh constituent, the unobscured nature and one flavor of the aggregates, andso forth, and their indivisibility, is considered as the single pervading agent. These con-stitute the ground of purification, the purifying agent, and the result of purification ofboth the causal and resultant ways. Moreover, all the aspects of the ground that arise asthe result are included in and taught as the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening(MH, f. 46b2-4).2.

The syllable vaô, symbol of bliss, is formed by the five immutable great emptinesses,and the syllable e, symbol of the dimension of emptiness, is formed (in the shape of atriangular dharmodaya) by the six immutable great emptinesses. The bases for this for-mation of the union of the two syllables are the aggregates, elements, sense powers,faculties, and activities of the faculties, in six sets of six (MH, f. 48a2-4). See also LongdolLama’s Kalachakra Tantra’s Sets of Terms According to Tsongkapa’s Treatises on the Subject,pp. 156-162.4. The psychophysical constituents are endowed with two purities (natural purity andpurity from adventitious stains); they are of one flavor in the state of bliss and emptinessand unified in a single immaculate collection; thus, they are referred to as empty. Suchemptiness can be experienced by nondual awareness alone; it is not simply negationbased on not finding anything upon examination (MH, f. 48a5-4).Pundarika states that emptiness (stong pa, Ÿánya) in this context refers to absence ofobscuration, sameness of nature, and unification into one of the factors (aggregates andso forth) included in the respective five emptinesses. It is not an absence of phenomenabecause they are personally perceived by the yogin (Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol. Tha,ff. 148b7-149a1).5.

Emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects (rnam pa kun gyi mchog dangldan pa’i stong pa nyid): in this context, “aspects” (rnam pa) refers to the clarity or ap-pearance aspect of emptiness, “supreme” (mchog) because appearance and emptiness arean inseparable unity from which nothing can be subtracted and to which nothing can beadded, utterly immutable.Kedrup Norzang states that in the Kalachakra system, the emptiness to be meditatedupon is twofold: with aspects (rnam bcas kyi stong pa nyid) and without aspects (rnammed -). The emptiness without aspects is the emptiness of not finding any intrinsicessence in the aggregates of forms and so forth, despite the scrutiny of discerning wis-dom, just as one finds no essence in a plantain tree. The emptiness with aspects, oremptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, refers to the variety of empty forms.This is not the emptiness that is a mere elimination by logic of the objects to be negated.It comprises the empty forms of the three worlds which are seen like the images in adivination mirror (Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, ff. 303b4-304a3).Kongtrul explains that the Kalachakra tantra teaches the emptiness endowed withthe supreme of all aspects, which constitutes the principal view of all the tantras. Thisemptiness alone is capable of producing supreme immutable bliss. Of the three aspectsof emptiness—that of the ground, path, and result—this is an emptiness meditatedupon on the path. In the Kalachakra system, supreme emptiness is called indefiniteemptiness (rnam par ma nges pa’i stong pa nyid) because the forms in which it manifestsare indefinite, being unlimited luminous clarity (’od gsal) and multicolored images (snatshogs gzugs brnyan, viŸvabimba). This emptiness is revealed after the manifestation often signs which are empty images (stong nyid kyi gzugs, Ÿányatabimba) produced by theyogas of the day (nyin gyi rnal ’byor) and of the night (mtshan mo’i rnal ’byor).

In the cosmology of the Kalachakra system, the world with its central Mount Meruis supported at its base by the five elements in a configuration of semi-spheres insertedone into the other. The letters symbolize the elements and also represent the way theyfirst arose. The letter ya (which in the arrangement of the ten letters is the base) repre-sents wind, the first element at the base of the world-system. Above ya stands ra, whichrepresents the fire element that develops from the friction of the wind arising fromdifferent directions and converging. Above the ra stands the letter va, which symbolizesthe water element. The water element descends from thick clouds formed by the steamof heat. Above the letter va stands la, which represents the earth element; it develops asa result of the action of wind “churning” the mass of water.

The first two branches, withdrawal and meditative absorption, purify thecentral channel and cause the appearance of the empty images of the ten signs, and soforth.

Kedrup Norzang explains the etymology of the term dus ’khor in the following way:During the path, when the ten winds enter the central channel, the natural mind ofluminous clarity manifests. Like the sun and its rays, there arise many empty imagereflections of that natural mind, which are like the forms in a divination mirror. As theempty images become more and more clear, at the end, they become the limitlessknowables (shes bya) of the three worlds, free of all obscurations. This is called “wheel”(cakra) or “wisdom” (prajñ›). The mind of luminous clarity, the supreme unchangingknower (shes pa), free of all obscurations, is the “time” (kal›) or “method” (up›ya). Theindivisible union of knowable and knower, or wisdom and method, is Kalachakra (De-tailed Elucidation, f. 238a4-7).CHAPTER 11: THE PATH1.

Concerning the etymology of maòçala (dkyil ’khor), maòça means heart (snying po)or essence (bcud), and la, to seize (’dzin pa) or take (len pa). Thus, it is called mandalabecause it causes one to seize or take hold of the basis of essential qualities (Dharmashri’sVOWS, f. 232b3-4). It denotes the gathering of the deities who are of the nature ofcompassion and wisdom, as well as the divine mansion that is their supporting environ-ment. The essence referred to in “seizing the essence” is the great bliss which is theindivisibility of emptiness and compassion. Such indivisibility is the progenitor of allmandalas and embodies all forms of deities whose nature is bodhichitta (mind of awak-ening) (Abhayakara’s Awn of Esoteric Instructions, Toh. 1198, ff. 82b4-83b6).20.

According toTaranata, the family of desire tantras (’dod chags kyi rigs kyi rgyud) are intended forpersons dominated by desire. These are exemplified by the Guhyasamaja (Toh. 442), theRed Yamari (Toh. 474, 475) and Black Yamari (Toh. 467, 469, 473), Krishnayamarimu-khasatchakra (Kæýòayam›rimukhaýaîcakras›dhana, gDong drug pa, Toh. 2015) and theVairochana Magical Net (possibly the same as the Secret Essence [Guhyagarbha, gSang ba’isnying po], Toh. 832). The Bhairava Tantra (Toh. 468) exemplifies the family of tantrasof aversion (zhe sdang gi rigs kyi rgyud) intended for persons dominated by aversion. TheChanting the Names of Manjushri (Toh. 360) exemplifies the tantras of delusion (gti muggi rigs kyi rgyud) intended for deluded persons.Each of these families of father tantras presents its content in accordance with itsname. In the Guhyasamaja and other desire tantras, the path of desire is of primaryimportance. The phase of generation involves mainly visualization of the forms of themale and female deity in union; appeal to the deities to melt into the vital essence; andemanation of the retinue deities from the womb of the main female deity, and so forth.The phase of completion involves mainly reliance on the consort. These desire tantrasdo not extensively present the ascertainment of reality, and fierce rites are not empha-sized. In the Bhairava and other tantras of aversion, one finds principally a single maledeity. The phase of completion in these tantras comprises methods of blocking the windsin the central channel that involve mainly one’s body alone (without consort). Fiercerites are described in great detail. The Chanting the Names of Manjushri and other tantrasof delusion, whether they present a single central figure or the male and female centralfigures in union, do not teach the emanation of the retinue from the womb of theconsort or the appeal to the deities to melt into the vital essence. They teach extensivelythe ground, path, and result. The phase of generation in these tantras emphasizesnonconceptual reality. Only in a minor way do they teach the path of desire and fierceacts (Taranata’s Origin of the Kalachakra Teachings, Collected Works, vol. 2, f. 4a2-4;Explanation of the Indestructible Way, Collected Works, vol. 8, ff. 7b7-10b5).40. Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra (Toh. 443), vol. Ca, f. 152b6.41.

The Secret Moon EssenceTantra (Toh. 477) and others belong to the Vajradhara family (BGP, ff. 164a4-185b1).42. Abhidhanottara Tantra (Toh. 369), vol. Ka, f. 208a3. Here, the title of this tantraappears as nges brjod while it most commonly appears as mngon brjod.43. Here, Heruka stands for Akshobhya; Vajraditya, for Ratnasambhava; Padmanartesh-vararaja, for Amitabha; and Ashvottama, for Amoghasiddhi. Taranata states that theBuddhasamayoga (Toh. 366) and the Secret Moon Essence (Toh. 477) exemplify theVajrasattva family; the Kalachakra belongs certainly to that family too, although it seemsrelated also to the Heruka family. The Chatuhpita (Toh. 428) is the only tantra of theVairochana family (or “permanent” family) that was translated into Tibetan. TheChakrasamvara (Toh. 368), Hevajra (Toh. 417, 418), Mahamaya (Toh. 435),Buddhakapala (Toh. 424), Vajrarali (Toh. 426), Rigi Aralli (Toh. 427), and Essence of theGreat Seal (Toh. 420) tantras exemplify the Heruka or Akshobhya family. The Vajramrita(Toh. 435) exemplifies the Vajraditya or Ratnasambhava family. The Kulalokanata (Toh.436) and the Padmanarteshvararaja Sadhana (Toh. 3160, 3161, 3335, 3423, 3424) ex-emplify the Padmanarteshvararaja or Amitabha family. The Tantra of the Origin of Tara(Toh. 726), Praise to the Twenty-one Forms of Tara (Toh. 437), and the various roottantras of Kilaya exemplify the Ashvottama or Amoghasiddhi family. The Tantra of theOrigin of Mahakala (Toh. 440), being a tantra of the activity type, also belongs to thislast family. See Taranata’s Origin of the Kalachakra Teachings, Collected Works, vol. 2, f.4a4-6; and Explanation of the Indestructible Way, Collected Works, vol. 8, ff. 10b5-16b4.In his General Presentation of the Sets of Tantra, Butön speaks of seven tantras ofwisdom (shes rab kyi rgyud) or mother tantras: those that teach equally all the six fami-lies, tantras of the Heruka family, of the Vairochana family, of the Vajraditya family, ofthe Padmanarteshvararaja family, of the Ashvottama family, and of the sixth family, thatof Vajradhara. The Indestructible Tent Tantra (Toh. 419) is the tantra that teaches all thefamilies equally and is considered by commentators to be the very origin of all mothertantras. Butön provides a long and comprehensive list of the tantras exemplifying theother families.44. Samputa Tantra (Toh. 381), vol. Ga, f. 117a7.45. Explaining this verse in his Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra, Kongtrul states thatall families have the single nature of innate joy (lhan cig skyes pa’i dga’ ba). To serve thepurpose of limitless kinds of trainees, innate joy is distinguished into thousands of fami-lies in the following way: At the time of the ground, innate joy is attended by obscurations,that is to say, differentiated into five states of mind that have the nature of the fiveemotional afflictions such as desire. Hence, it becomes the five families of Vairochana,and so forth. Extensively subdivided, the five families become as numerous as the grainsof sand of ten Ganges rivers. Each of the five root families is subdivided into five smallerfamilies, thus yielding twenty-five. Distinguished in terms of method and wisdom, thesebecome fifty. Distinguished in terms of body and mind, these become one hundred.Each of these has one hundred subdivisions, each of which is further divided into onehundred, and so forth, ad infinitum (CH, ff. 204b3-205b6).NOTES TO PAGES 213 TO 214\u0002459"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"460\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA46. Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra (Toh. 3713), vol. Tsu, f. 106b6-107a3.47. Butön differentiates tantras according to the teacher of the tantra (ston pa), theperson who has requested the teaching (zhu ba po), the compiler (sdud pa po), and thetrainee (’dul bya).A tantra taught by a teacher in the form of Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, and so on, in themidst of an entourage of queens is a father tantra. If it is taught by a teacher who is aheruka, a sky-farer, or a female deity, it is a mother tantra.A tantra requested by a bodhisattva or a male deity is a father tantra; one requestedfor the sake of or by a female deity is a mother tantra even though the teacher may be amale deity.Although Vajrapani is generally considered to have been the compiler of the tantras,in some cases, the tantra has been compiled by the same person who requested it. Forinstance, the Guhyasamaja was compiled by Vajradharma and is therefore a father tantra.Those compiled by a female deity are mother tantras.If the tantra has been taught for the sake of males, it is a father tantra; if taught forthe sake of females, it is a mother tantra. It is also a father tantra if it was taught for thesake of uplifting Buddhist trainees who have fallen into wrong ways or adhere to wrongviews concerning Buddhist tenets. It is a mother tantra if taught in order to uplift non-Buddhists who have fallen into wrong ways and adhere to wrong views, who enjoykilling, and so forth.These characteristics are noted in terms of their predominance in a particular tantra.All tantras share these characteristics to a certain extent (BGP, ff. 282a2-283a5).48. Deities in forms conforming to the ways of the world would be, for example, deitiesseated on jewel-bedecked thrones or lion thrones, who hold the jewel, wheel, and so on,as insignias, and wear silk scarves, and so forth. Deities represented sitting or standingon corpses or skulls, holding the curved knife, skull cup, staff (khaþvaêga), or smalldrum as insignias; wearing bone ornaments, garlands of heads, human heads, humanskin as garments, or otherwise naked, are forms that are contrary to the ways of theworld (BGP, ff. 280b4-281a1).49. The meaning here is probably that father tantra is intended for practitioners of lesserwisdom, and mother tantra, for those of higher wisdom.CHAPTER 12: INITIATION1. Nagarjuna’s Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja, for example, states that one mustrecite 100,000 of the mantra of the main deity and his consort and 10,000 of the man-tras of each of the other deities of the mandala (Toh. 1798, vol.

For example, in places such as a monastery, temple, or residence, it is not necessary to digthe soil to clear the ground of stones, thorns, and other faults of the earth (IBTS, p. 281).11. Abhayakara’s Indestructible Garland Mandala Rituals (Toh. 3140), vol. Phu.12. As to the examination of the directions, if a site is elevated at the center anddepressed in the east and north, it is considered to be a suitable place. On the contrary,if the site is depressed in the center and elevated in the east and north, it is not suit-able.Abhayakara notes the negative effects of building in an unsuitable place: If the landresembles a tortoise’s back, there is risk of death or impoverishment; if elevated in thenorth, there is risk of extinction of one’s family lineage; and if elevated in the east anddepressed in the center, risk of the practitioner’s death (Indestructible Garland MandalaRituals, Toh. 3140, f. 2b6).Taranata sets forth the associations of the colors of the earth with the four castes. Aplace where the earth is black is associated with the menial caste and is fit for the activa-tion rituals of killing, drawing out, and parting; yellow earth is associated with the mer-chant caste, the place fit for stupefying, paralyzing, and striking; red earth is associatedwith the royal caste, the place fit for dominating and drawing in; white is associated withthe brahmin caste, the place fit for peaceful and enriching activities; green earth is asso-ciated with the lowest caste, the place fit for all activities; blue earth has the same charac-teristics as green; earth of uncertain color has the same characteristics as that of the black(Mandala Ritual of Kalachakra, Collected Works, vol. 3, ff. 21b7-22a2).Concerning the examination of the characteristics and signs shown by earth andwater tests, the General Tantra (Toh. 806) (as cited in Zhuchen Tsultrim Rinchen’s Cata-logue of the Tengyur, p. 569) explains: In examining the characteristics of the site todetermine whether it has any defects, it is to be considered inauspicious if the site hassteep slopes, thorny brambles, potsherds, bones, cracks, tree-stumps, holes, ant-hills,ashes, alkaline soil, pebbles, dust, stones, hairs, and insects such as ants.To examine the signs shown by a test of the earth, one digs a knee-deep hole, andthen, with the same earth, refills the hole. If there is more than sufficient earth to refillthe hole, one will gain powers through practice in that place.To examine the signs shown by a test of the water, one digs a hole half a cubit deepand fills it up with water. Then, one walks one hundred paces away and quickly returnsto examine the level of the water; if it has not diminished, the place is ideal.As to the site suitable for drawing the mandala, Kongtrul states that it can be in themidst of a forest or garden, or in a house where a bodhisattva lives, or in a temple thatcontains statues of the buddhas. An unsuitable site is a place where the people are unrulyand hostile (CH, f. 153b4-6).NOTES TO PAGES 215 TO 220\u0002461"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"462\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA13. The request for the site in the case of a manifest being (i.e., the owner of the place, aking, minister, or another) is made by verbal agreement or purchase. The request for thesite in the case of a non-manifest being is made as follows: First, having performed theyoga of generating oneself as the deity, one arranges offerings and torma (bali) on thespot, calls upon the local spirits (known as “lords of the ground”) (gzhi bdag) of differentkinds who are natural dwellers of the place, makes offerings, and requests them to grantthe place for the use of the mandala. To ask permission from the earth goddess, who isthe owner of all earth in general, first one invites the earth goddess, who is yellow incolor, peaceful in aspect, and adorned with yellow scarves and jewels. In her left hand,she holds a longevity vase filled with nectar; with the right hand, she performs the ges-ture of “accepting to be the witness.” Having invoked the goddess, one offers to herfragrances and other objects of sensory appeal, as well as the torma. After one asks herpermission to use the place and receives it, she merges into the place. The details in theprocedure to request the site vary somewhat according to different tantras. See Taranata’sMandala Ritual of Kalachakra, Collected Works, vol. 3; Mandala Ritual of GuhyasamajaAccording to the Nagarjuna Tradition, Collected Works, vol. 5; and Mandala Ritual ofVajrapani Mahachakra, Collected Works, vol. 8.14. Uraga (lto ’phye) (lit. “slithers on the belly”) is a naga protector of the earth. In theKalachakra Tantra, it is called the “Rahu of the earth” (sa yi sgra gcan) and in Pundarika’sStainless Light Commentary on the Kalachakra, Rudra (Drag po).Tatagatavajra describes the uraga as follows: It is white in color, radiates light, andwears various ornaments. Below the navel, it has the form of a snake; above, that of ahuman with a hood of nine snakes. It lies on its left side with the left hand at the ear. Itshand holds a jewel at the hip. It emits the sound “phu, phu.” It reclines on an areacovering one ninth of the soil, with eight naga kings disposed along its body: Kulika (rigsldan), brilliant green, situated at the tip of the tail; Karkotaka (stobs kyi rgyud), grey incolor, at the secret place; Shankapala (dung skyong), white in color, at the navel;Mahapadma (padma chen po), golden in color, at the shoulders; Vasuki (nor rgyas), green,at the heart; Takshaka (’jog po), red, at the neck; Padma (padma), radiant white, at theears; and Ananta (mtha’ yas), blue, at the crown of the head. The upper body of each onelooks like that of a god, head hooded with seven snakes, and the lower part resembles acoiled snake, hands holding blazing jewels (Ritual for the Mandala of GloriousChakrasamvara, Toh. 1511, vol. Zha, ff. 310a6-311).As the uraga revolves clockwise according to the passage of the sun through thetwelve houses, one must first determine the direction in which its head points in anygiven season and month. Dharmashri, in his Radiance of the Sun, a manual on astrology,provides a diagram to determine the position of the uraga. The diagram is a circle di-vided into thirty-six sectors, which start from the center of the circle and end on itscircumference. Outside and along the circumference, the circle is adorned with twelvelotus petals, each a house. The width of each petal is that of three sectors of the circle. Inbetween the petals and the circle is a rim with spaces equal in number to the threehundred and sixty days of the year. East and the other cardinal and intermediate direc-tions are marked next to the petals. By considering the house and the day on the dia-gram, one determines the position of the head of the uraga in a certain season, month,and day. Based on that knowledge, one strikes a line from the direction of the head’sposition to the tail; along this line, the body of the uraga will be drawn."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Once the uraga’s point of revolving in time and space has been determined, one mustdetermine the location of its armpit (kakýa) (where a small rectangular ritual box will bedrawn). It is there that the yogin will first dig two or three shovelfuls, and afterwards digthe remaining earth in the square, without risk of offending the field protector.In the place where one has dug the fifth shovelful, one buries a treasure vase, makesofferings to and praises the god of the earth, and asks to be pardoned; at that point, oneimagines the uraga, pleased, dissolving into the earth.

It is anexceptionally good portent if the digging of the site reveals precious stones, quartz, sil-ver, and so forth. These should be left untouched in the earth. If the purpose is to builda house for the mandala, the digging should be done until water or a layer of stone isreached. If the purpose is simply to build a mandala above the earth, a cubit is sufficient.See Taranata’s Mandala Ritual of Kalachakra, Collected Works, vol. 3, ff. 23b4-24b7.16. To perform rituals of purification, one first scares away interferences by touching theground while reciting, for instance, the mantra of Kandaroha (Dum skyes ma) (in thecase of the mandala ritual of Chakrasamvara) and scatters water, ashes, and white mus-tard seeds activated with that mantra. Then, one applies to the soil the five types of cowexcretions, which have been sprinkled with saffron water. While doing so, one recitesthe mantra oô bhá khaô to transform the soil into the nature of space. Reciting háôl›m háô, one imagines that the soil is of vajra nature. At this point, the earth goddesscan be invited again (if so desired), venerated with offerings, and reabsorbed into theearth. (Taranata also mentions purification effected through the fire-offering ritual, whichcould be included here in the purification using substances.)

Holding vajra and bell, the master sits in the center of the site, facing what would bethe eastern gate of the mandala, carries out the procedure of self-generation and genera-tion of the deities of the mandala, and seeks permission to draw the mandala.

Thereaf-ter, the master, having emanated as the appropriate wrathful deity, points to the groundwith the hand mudra of the vajra fists united with the middle fingers outstretched andtouching each other. Raising the gesture over his head, the master then lifts the mandalaNOTES TO PAGES 220 TO 221\u0002463"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"464\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAup into space. At that point, standing and facing south, the master, with hands in prayerposition on his head, pays homage to the buddhas and then issues the command to thedemonic forces to leave the place (Tatagatavajra’s Ritual for the Mandala of GloriousChakrasamvara, f. 312b4-9). See also Kuladatta’s Compendium of Procedures (Toh. 2531),ff. 286a4-287b1; and Taranata’s Mandala Ritual of Vajrapani Mahachakra, CollectedWorks, vol. 8, f. 4a4-b6.18. As to the way the obstructing forces are expelled by the master, see Kuladatta’s Com-pendium of Procedures (Toh. 2531), vol. Ku, ff. 287a5-292b7.19. Ten daggers (phur ba) are struck and left fixed in the ground in the ten directions,outside the mandala: four are placed in the four cardinal directions, four in the interme-diate ones; the dagger of the zenith is placed east of the eastern one; and the one of thenadir, west of the western one. These are extracted at the conclusion of the mandalaritual when the mandala is dismantled (Bokar Rinpoché, oral communication).20. The site, cleared of obstructing forces, is encircled on the outside by a protectivevajra circle, consisting of a vajra tent, ground, and fire. The site is transformed (blessed)through mantras into one of vajra (indestructible) nature (Kuladatta’s Compendium ofProcedures, ff. 298b4-299a5). For Kedrupjé’s discussion of the details of these rituals, seeIBTS, pp. 279-283.21. Kedrupjé explains that in the case of a mandala of painted cloth, the examination,ritual of clearing the site with digging, and requesting the site are not required. How-ever, one must perform the ritual of seizing, protecting, and blessing the site as for thecolored powders mandala (IBTS, p. 301).22. Net of Magical Manifestation: The Great King of Tantras (Toh. 466), a tantra of theyoga tantra class.23. This is a reference to Nagabodhi’s Twenty Rituals of the Guhyasamaja Mandala (Toh.1810, vol. Ngi, f. 131a7), where he says: “...first pitch the lines and after that/ Make thefoundation (lhags gnas) of the earth goddess, and so forth.”24. According to Tatagatavajra, the earth goddess is yellow, in a peaceful mode, wearingwhite clothing and ornaments. In the left hand, she holds a golden vase, and with theright, performs the mudra of giving protection from fear. Once the pledge goddess hasbeen generated from the syllable bam, at one’s right hand, one visualizes a moon diskwith three hums. Pressing the earth with the fingers, the sound and light of hum invokethe pristine awareness deity to merge with the pledge one. One then makes offerings toher and praises her. Finally, by the power of one’s mantra, she is reabsorbed into theearth (Ritual for the Mandala of Glorious Kalachakra, Toh. 1511, vol. Zha, f. 314a2-b2).According to Taranata and the earlier Tibetan masters, since the tantras state that theritual of the earth goddess is to be performed only once, at this point it is not necessaryto do because the ritual of the earth goddess is performed in the context of the ritual ofthe site (Mandala Ritual of Vajrapani Mahachakra, Collected Works, vol. 8, f. 6b6).25. Action lines (las thig, karmasátra), so called because they serve as the basis for thesubsequent ritual actions related to the mandala. They are also known as “wet lines”(rlon thig) as the thread is moistened by rubbing it with chalk or another substance."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"With the pitching of the action lines, one sketches the entire structure of the mandala todetermine the spots where the deities will be. For the procedure, see Rongta LozangDamchö Gyatso’s The Creation of Mandalas: Tibetan texts detailing the techniques forlaying out and executing tantric Buddhist psychocosmograms (New Delhi, 1971), vol. 1.For the dimensions of the mandala in the Hevajra tantra used for the initiation and thecorrespondence to the body, see CH, f. 154b.26. As to the material of vases, Pundarika states that a crystal vase is used for appease-ment rituals (Ÿantika); silver, for enriching (pauýîika); human skull, for killing; iron, forexpulsion (ucc›îana) and separating (vidveýa); gold, for dominating (vaŸya); copper, forsummoning (›kæýîi); clay, for paralyzing (stambhana); and wood, for stupefying (mohana)(Stainless Light, Toh. 1347, vol. Da, f. 96b1-5).As to their dimensions, the vases for appeasing and enriching purposes must be six-teen fingers wide in the belly, twenty fingers high from the bottom to the top lips, withthe lips hanging down from the mouth two fingers long, and the neck, six fingers wide.The mouth (from the extremity of one lip to the other) is eight fingers wide (the mouthopening, six fingers; the two lips, one finger each). The vases used for purposes of otheractivation rituals differ in their dimensions.As for their numbers and names, Kedrupjé says that for the most elaborate rituals,the number of the vases equals that of the deities of the mandala. To simplify, one mayuse five vases, one vase for the generation of the main male and female deities and fourvases, one in each direction, for the generation of the deities of the four directions. In avery simple form, one uses two vases, the victorious vase (rnam rgyal bum pa, vijayakalaŸa)(so called since it is victorious over the enemy of habitual tendencies associated withemotional afflictions), used at the time of the initiation, and the action vase (las bum,karmakalaŸa), used for sprinkling consecrated water on the offerings, oneself, and thestudents (IBTS, p. 287).The substances placed in the vases are the five nectars, five perfumes, five jewels, fivemedicinal herbs, and five grains. The branches of the amra, udumbara, ashoka, bodhi,and naga trees are the ornaments of the mouth (kha rgyan) of the vase, while a whitescarf or brocade adorns its neck (Tatagatavajra’s Ritual for the Mandala of GloriousChakrasamvara, Toh. 1511, vol. Zha, f. 315a1-3). The substances vary according to theclass of tantra, the ones used in action tantras being particularly different from thoseused in the highest yoga tantras. The Kalachakra, for example, lists five groups oftwenty-five items each. See Pundarika’s Stainless Light (Toh. 1347), vol. Da, ff. 148b6-150a2. On the various substances placed in vases and their symbolism, see LITE, pp.79-81.The vases, set in the appropriate places (the victorious one outside the eastern gateon the right side, the action vase at the northeast), are first contemplated as emptiness.From within emptiness, from the letter bam appears a lotus; on the top of the lotus, aletter a transforms into a moon disk. On the moon disk, from the letter bhrum arisevases imagined to be made of precious gems. In the victorious vase, one imagines thepledge deities of the entire mandala, and in the action vase, the appropriate wrathfuldeity alone. One then imagines that the pristine awareness deities merge into them. Onethen makes offerings and recites their mantras, which causes the vases to be filled withthe nectar that flows from their bodies. Thereafter, the deities dissolve into light andNOTES TO PAGES 221 TO 222\u0002465"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"466\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAmelt into the water of the vases. See Tatagatavajra’s Ritual for the Mandala of GloriousChakrasamvara (Toh. 1511), vol. Zha, ff. 314b3-315b1; and Taranata’s Mandala Ritualof Vajrapani Mahachakra, Collected Works, vol. 8, ff. 6b4-7a6.In the Kalachakra tantra, the entire mandala of deities is generated also in theconch-shell (called mah›vijayakalaŸa, great victorious vase, which is placed on the topof the victorious vase), whereas most of the other tantras teach the generation of themandala in the victorious vase alone. In the case of the Hevajra tantra, the victoriousvase is placed outside the eastern gate of the mandala. If other deities’ vases distinctfrom the victorious one are used, these are placed in their respective directions (out-side the mandala), and the action vase is placed in the northeast direction (CH, f.162b2).27. The insignia vary from one tantra to the next. In the Chakrasamvara tantra, forinstance, the insignia is a curved knife, which is generated as the deity Kandaroha.28. Purification with water, or ritual ablution (khrus), is a form of initiation in which themaster calls upon the deities to wash the student with the water of their vases whileuttering the words: “Ji ltar bltams pa...abhishekata...” (Taranata’s Mandala Ritual ofVajrapani Mahachakra, Collected Works, vol. 8, f. 18b3).29. The inner initiation consists in the student “taking birth” imaginatively as the childof the deity from which he or she is going to receive initiation. The master is imagined inthe form of the male and female deities in union. Light radiating from the master’s heartdraws the student into his mouth. From there, the student descends into the lotus of theconsort and there dissolves into emptiness. The mind cognizing emptiness transformsinto the seed syllable of the deity, which transforms into a vajra, and that into the simpleform of the deity. Light from the heart of the master as deity draws all the enlightenedones of the universe into his body. There they melt into vital essence, which descendsthrough the secret channel of the father, reaching the lotus of the mother. As a result, inthat place, initiation is conferred, which is to say, pristine awareness of great bliss isexperienced by the student while imagining himself or herself in the form of the deity.Thereafter, the student emerges from the mother’s womb and takes a position outsidethe eastern gate of the mandala. See Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama’s TheKalachakra Tantra: Rite of Initiation, translated by Jeffrey Hopkins (henceforth cited asKT), pp. 174-176.30. In the Kalachakra system, forehead, throat, heart, navel, crown of the head, andsecret parts are blessed with the letters of the six buddha families, oô, › ̄, háô, ho ̄, haô,kýha ̄, respectively (Naropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the Kalachakra Initiation,Toh. 1351, ff. 227b7-228a1).31. The tooth-stick (still used in India), twelve fingers-widths in length, is made ofudumbara wood or another sweet wood. Its top is adorned with a garland of flowers(Naropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the Kalachakra Initiation, Toh. 1351, f. 227b5).The board shows a diagram with a center and four diagonal sections representing thefive buddha families.32.

The pristine awareness lines (ye shes thig, jñ›nasátra), also known as “dry lines” (skamthig) because no color is applied to them, are pitched right on the action lines, buttoward the sky, in order to bless them after the mandala that was raised in the sky ismerged with the pledge mandala visualized on the site.34. Kuladatta explains that the threads for the string used to pitch the lines must beeither spun by a virgin or bought by a hero (yogin). These, twenty-five in number, areeach colored one of the five colors (white, yellow, red, green, and black). The strings areblessed as the essence of the five transcendent ones with bhrum, am, dzim, kham, andhum, their five seed syllables. Thus, every transcendent one, distinguished in terms ofthe five pristine awarenesses, is represented by five different colored threads; the twenty-five are twisted together (first in groups of five, then altogether) to make the one stringfor pitching the lines. The string is placed in a golden vessel, or one of a different sub-stance, and offered perfume, flowers, and incense, and protected by means of the recita-tion of the appropriate mantra (Compendium of Procedures, Toh. 2531, vol. Ku, ff.247b3-249a4). On the way of pitching the lines, see Tatagatavajra’s Ritual for the Mandalaof Glorious Chakrasamvara (Toh. 1511), vol. Zha, ff. 316b6-321a4.According to Bhavabhadra, the sacred colored powders should be prepared with hu-man bones. Dankadasa comments that the best material for the colors are substancesfound in charnel grounds; the middling, the powders of five kinds of jewels, sapphire,pearl, blue beryl, crystal, and emerald; another list gives dark blue precious stone (mumen), conch-shell, coral, gold, and silver. If one cannot procure these precious items, theleast acceptable are colored powders made from rice and other grains dyed with fivecolors (CH, f. 152a2-6). For the coloring procedure, see Tatagatavajra’s Ritual for theMandala of Glorious Chakrasamvara (Toh. 1511), vol. Zha, f. 321a4.35. See Kedrupjé’s discussion of these points in IBTS, pp. 259-301.36. Entry into the mandala is twofold: entering while blindfolded and entering in thenature of seeing the deities of the mandala. The first consists of entry outside the curtainand entry beyond the curtain. Entry outside the curtain is known as outer magnificence.Entry beyond the curtain is called inner magnificence of the descent of pristine aware-ness (Longdol Lama’s Sets of Terms Derived from the Awareness-Holder Collection of SecretMantra, p. 193).37. At this point, the student wears the crown of the five buddhas and an upper andlower garment of brocade symbolizing the deity’s attire.38. To generate the awakening mind of all-encompassing yoga (thams cad rnal ’byor gyisems bskyed), one imagines that one’s aspiration to awaken manifests as a moon disk atone’s heart. On the top of the moon disk, one’s understanding of the emptiness of allphenomena manifests in the aspect of a vajra. These steps constitute the generation ofthe mind of all-encompassing yoga, the union of the two truths. Resolving to maintainthese two minds (the aspiration to awaken and the understanding of emptiness), onerecites oô sarva yoga chittaô utpaday›mi. At the same time, one visualizes that a replicaof the moon and vajra at the heart of the master (as deity) dissolves into one’s heart,stabilizing such yoga.Sworn to secrecy means that the master warns the student not to show the mandalato unqualified persons. The student is given the “water of the pledges” (dam chu) toNOTES TO PAGES 222 TO 224\u0002467"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"468\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAdrink, enjoining him or her to safeguard the pledges; if the pledges are not safeguarded,the water will turn into fire; if safeguarded, it will bring about all attainments (Taranata’sMandala Ritual of Vajrapani Mahachakra, Collected Works, vol. 8, ff. 193-195). On thisphase of the initiation procedure, see KT, pp. 217-235.39. The student, clasping the vajra that is held in the hand of the “action-vajra” (las kyirdo rje) who has emanated from the heart of the main deity, is led inside the protectivecircle of the mandala (Taranata’s Mandala Ritual of Vajrapani Mahachakra, CollectedWorks, vol. 8, f. 19a6-7).40. The four oaths (dam bzhag bzhi) are proclaimed by the master while the studentremains silent. The student is touched on the head with the vajra held in the master’shand and is given consecrated water to sip. The four oaths are one, the pledge concern-ing the deity, which is to maintain the deity of the initiation as one’s favored deity; two,the pledge given in terms of consequences: if one’s favored deity is forsaken, heavy con-sequences will befall one; three, the pledge given in terms of benefits: if one safeguardsthe pledges, one will gain the desired powers and supreme attainment; and four, thepledge to heed the master’s words and put them into practice (Bokar Rinpoché, oralcommunication).41. For an example of this procedure, see Taranata’s Mandala Ritual of VajrapaniMahachakra, Collected Works, vol. 8, ff. 19b4-20a4.42. Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra (Toh. 443), vol. Ca, f. 153a4-5.43. On this expression, “the same as that,” used for the fourth initiation, see IK, pp. 83-84.44. Likely a reference to Ghantapa’s Synopsis of the Initiation Procedure for Chakrasamvara(Toh. 1431), vol. Wa, ff. 219b3-222b5.45. The sense of these three pledges is to recognize, in accordance with one’s level ofunderstanding, that one’s body, speech, and mind are the three states of awakened body,speech, and mind, and to maintain this recognition in meditation. See Kongtrul’s Bud-dhist Ethics (English translation), p. 249. The vajra (rdo rje, vajra) represents method(thabs, up›ya) or the mind of awakening, and the bell (dril bu, ghaòîa), wisdom (shes rab,prajñ›) that directly knows reality. Not to forsake method and wisdom and to applythem is the nature of the two pledges. The seal refers to the great seal (phyag rgya chen po,mah›mudr›), which consists in the contemplation of the deity’s form (Pema Karpo’s TV,vol. Ca, ch. 3, f. 80a6-b5).46. For details on the masters belonging to the Ngog clan (rngog), see BA, pp. 72-73, 75,325, and 698; in particular, on the system of Ngog Loden Sherab (rNgog blo ldan shesrab), see BA, pp. 1059-1109.47. These initiations of the five awarenesses are conferred in order to bless the five aggre-gates of the student as the five buddhas (Akshobhya, etc.) and bless the emotional afflic-tions as the five pristine awarenesses. For the water initiation, the master sprinkles andpours water from the vase onto the crown of the head of the student. For the diademinitiation, he places the diadem of the five buddhas on the student’s head. For the vajrainitiation, he places a vajra in the student’s right hand which is then rotated to finally"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"touch the heart. For the bell initiation, he places the bell in the left hand, whereupon thestudent sounds it and then holds it at the hip. For the name initiation, the name of thefamily where the flower fell is given (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 241b3-6).48. In another interpretation, these are called “awareness (vidya) initiations” becausethey are conferred by Lochana and the other awareness females (Lvabapa’s IlluminatingLamp for the Precious Mandala Ritual of Chakrasamvara, Toh. 1444, vol. Wa, f. 265b5).49. This is similar to the method of initiation as “sovereign over the domain of thedoctrine in the three worlds,” which the buddhas confer on bodhisattvas who haveattained the tenth stage. See IBTS, pp. 315-316.50. Ultimate mantra (don dam pa’i sngags) refers to the knowledge that everything is thenature of essential reality (MH, f. 61b4).51. The supernormal cognition of the divine eye (lha’i mig gi mngon shes), one of the five,or six, supernormal cognitive powers. See Chapter 4, n. 28.52. Four demonic forces (bdud bzhi): the demon of the aggregates (phung po’i bdud);the demon of emotional afflictions (nyon mongs pa’i bdud); the demon of the lord ofdeath (’chi bdag gi bdud); and the demon of the god-child (lha’i bu’i bdud). The firstdemon includes the five aggregates, forms, and so on. The second demon includes allemotional afflictions throughout the three realms. The third refers to the impermanent,perishable, and changeable nature of the aggregates and emotional afflictions. The lastdemon refers to the divine demon of the desire realm, lord of the realm known as Mas-tery over Others’ Magical Creations, whose power draws beings of the desire realm awayfrom the practice of virtue and the path of non-attachment.From the particular perspective of tantra, the obscuration related to the vital essence(thig le) of the body is the demon of the aggregates; the obscuration of the vital essenceof speech, the demon of emotional afflictions; the obscuration of the vital essence ofmind, the demon of the lord of death; and the obscuration of the vital essence related tothe habitual tendency for emission of semen (orgasm), the demon of the god-child.These demons have the nature of the four states, waking, dream, sleep, and orgasm,respectively. Inasmuch as they are impurities of one’s mind, these demons are not trulyexistent objects to be forsaken but are solely deceptive manifestations of mind (Taranata’sCSI, ff. 5b6-6b5).53. Childhood (byis pa) carries three different meanings: one, the state of an ordinaryindividual (so so skye bo) who has not understood emptiness directly; two, that of astupid person (blun po); and three, that of a young child (na tshod byis pa). Here, itsignifies primarily a person who is stupid in the sense of not being fit to receive thehigher initiations, or a person who is like a child in that his mind has not yet beenripened by the initiation. By receiving the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood(byis pa ltar ’jug pa’i dbang), the individual becomes ripened in that he or she acquires thegood fortune of being able to receive the higher initiations. The seven are thus initia-tions associated with a boy or a girl less than fifteen years of age (Taranata’s Commentaryon the Summary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation, ff. 14a5-15b2.)Kedrup Norzang states that the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood areknown as the “seven water initiations” (chu’i dbang bdun) since they all include waterNOTES TO PAGES 224 TO 229\u0002469"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"470\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAritual but are not called “vase initiation” (bum dbang) (Detailed Elucidation, f. 119b6).The same opinion is expressed by Panchen Lozang Chögyen in his Presentation of theDoctrine in General and the Four Tantra Sets, p. 34.54.

The seven initiations correspond to the four indestructible states, or vajras, of body,speech, mind, and pristine awareness. The water and the diadem initiations cleanse theimpurities of the body and establish the potency for the vajra body. The silk ribbons andvajra and bell initiations cleanse the impurities of speech and establish the potency forvajra speech. The conduct and name initiations cleanse the impurities of the mind andestablish the potency for vajra mind. The permission initiation cleanses the obscurationsto pristine awareness, conceptions related to desire, and establishes the potency for pris-tine awareness.The water initiation purifies the elements of space, wind, fire, water, and earth. As aresult, during the path, pristine awareness manifests from the dissolution of the mandalasor winds in the central channel, and at the time of the result, the five pristine awarenessesassociated with wisdom are attained. The potencies for the states of the five consorts,Vajradhatvishvari and the others, are established.The diadem initiation purifies the five aggregates. As a result, during the path, pris-tine awareness manifests from the dissolution of the mandalas or winds of the five aggre-gates in the central channel, and at the time of the result, the five pristine awarenessesassociated with method are attained and the five buddhas are actualized.The silk ribbons initiation purifies the ten karmic winds (five root and five branch).As a result, during the path, pristine awarenesses associated with the ten perfections andthe ten signs are perfected, and the ten shaktis (nus ma, Ÿakti) are actualized.In the vajra and bell initiation, the vajra purifies the solar channel, rasana, and thebell purifies the lunar channel, lalana. The lunar and solar include the life wind con-nected with the lunar element and the downward-voiding wind connected with thesolar element. Thus, the initiation empowers the practitioner to bind these winds in thesingle central channel (thus the expression “sun and moon in one”). To signify this,during the initiations, vajra and bell are held in the manner of embrace. Because thewinds that flow in the central, right, and left channels, and so on, constitute the basis forspeech, this initiation is associated with speech. The vajra represents immutable greatbliss, the reality dimension (dharmak›ya), which is fulfillment of one’s own objectives.The bell represents awakened speech which, being unceasingly present, is invincible; itis the enjoyment dimension (sambhogak›ya), the basis for the fulfillment of others’ ob-jectives (Taranata’s CSI, ff. 16b4-17b2).Naropa explains that the initiation of the indestructible conduct consists in the puri-fication of the eye and other sense powers and their objects, visual forms, and so on.

Through the purity of the senses and their objects, the vajra con-duct actualizes the body of the empty image of Kalachakra, and through the power ofthis image, the vital essence is not emitted (’pho med), thus the name “pure conduct ofnon-emission of the vital essence” (CSI, f. 17b3-4).Naropa explains that the initiation of the name (the name ending with “vajra”) isconferred in order to unify the various castes. Consequently, this initiation leads to theperfection of the four immeasurable thoughts of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity,which unceasingly purify attachment, aversion, and so forth (Commentary on the Sum-mary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation, Toh. 1351, f. 237b6-7).Taranata notes that the elements purified here are the six action faculties and their sixactivities. The initiation actualizes the potencies for the pristine awarenesses related tothe five immeasurable thoughts; for the performance of various activation rituals toinfluence others; and for the attainment of the state of the ten wrathful deities, malesand females in union. The fifth immeasurable thought refers to immeasurable sameness(mnyam pa nyid tshad med) (CSI f. 17b4-5). To symbolize this, in the actual procedureof the initiation, bracelets and anklets or garlands are placed on the wrists and legs(Longdol Lama’s History of the Kalachakra Tantra and Its Various Sets of Terms, p. 143).Naropa states that the permission initiation authorizes the student to teach, in itsaspects of the relative and ultimate truths, the supreme indestructible way to countlessbeings according to their individual inclinations and abilities. Such an initiation leads tothe perfection of the awakened state itself (Commentary on the Summary of the [Kalachakra]Initiation, Toh. 1351, ff. 237b7-238a1).The permission initiation purifies the aggregates and elements and actualizes thepotencies for the pristine awareness of the union of emptiness and bliss; for the perfectpromulgation of the doctrine; and for the actualization of the state of Vajrasattva andPrajnaparamita (CSI, f. 17b6-7).For the actual procedure of these initiations, see Naropa’s Commentary on the Sum-mary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation, Toh. 1351, ff. 234b3-236a1; and KT, pp. 109-125,263-353.58.

Dharmashri states that the mandala of the channels of the body, the essential prin-ciple of oneself, serves as the general mandala for all three higher initiations. In particu-lar, the secret initiation is conferred in the mandala of the bhaga of letters, the essentialprinciple of mantra. The pristine awareness through wisdom is conferred in the mandalaof relative bodhichitta (vital essence), the essential principle of the deity. The fourth, orword initiation, is conferred in the mandala of pristine awareness and wind, which is theessence of ultimate bodhichitta, the essential principle of pristine awareness (VOWS, f.234b1-3).61. The twelve examples of illusion: a magical creation (sgyu ma); a mirage (smig rgyu);the city of gandharvas (dri za’i grong khyer); Shakra’s bow (brgya byin gzhu), i.e., a rain-bow (’ja’ tshon); an image reflected in a mirror (me long gi gzugs brnyan); the moonreflected on water (chu zla); an echo (sgra brnyan); a dream (rmi lam); an optical illusion(mig yor); a cloud (sprin); lightning (glog); and a bubble on water (chu yi chu bur)(Aryadeva’s Stages of Self-Blessing, Toh. 1805, f. 113a2-3).62. According to Naropa, the pristine awareness of bliss experienced during the thirdinitiation is not the actual one but serves as an example. Maitripa, on the other hand,asserts that it is actual pristine awareness but needs to be pointed out through wordsduring the fourth initiation in order to elicit direct knowing. Marpa maintains thatthese views are essentially identical since Maitripa’s assertion takes into considerationstudents’ different capacities: if a student is able to bind vital essence, then the pristineawareness of bliss becomes actual; if he is unable, it is simply an example (Bokar Rinpoché,oral communication).63. See Chapter 7, nn. 5 and 10.64. The consort of the yogin is referred to as an “action seal” (las kyi phyag rgya,karmamudr›). The consort is known as seal because she is sealed by the indivisible vajraof pristine awareness, or because by relying on a consort belonging to one of the fivefamilies, the yogin’s mind is sealed by the vajra of innate bliss undivided by subject-object duality (CH, ff. 75b7-78a3).The Hevajra Tantra speaks of five types of consorts related to the five families. Aconsort of the vajra family of Akshobhya is a washer woman (g.yung mo); one of the lotusfamily of Amitabha, a dancer (gar ma); one of the action family of Amoghasiddhi, a dyer(tshos mkhan ma); one of the transcendent family of Vairochana, a brahmin girl (bram zemo); and one of the jewel family of Ratnasambhava, an outcaste girl (gdol pa ma) (CH, f.78b2-b4). The best among the five consorts is one of the vajra family; she has an ex-"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"tremely beautiful face, is good natured, without jealousy and full of compassion, and isyouthful. She is initiated by the yogin himself. As to her body size, she is neither too tallnor too short. Irrespective of the family the yogin belongs to, this consort is the best. Ifa yogin does not find such a consort, he must rely on a consort who belongs to his ownfamily. For example, if he is of the lotus family, he should rely on a consort of the lotusfamily. The consort’s complexion clearly indicates the family she belongs to. The color ofthe Vairochana family is white; therefore, a consort of that family would be a qualifiedbrahmin girl or another female of white complexion. When a consort of his own familyis not found, the yogin may resort to one of another family or a non-human one, such asa goddess or celestial musician (gandharva) (CH, ff. 93b2-94a3).Consorts are of three types, mantra-born (sngags skyes), field-born (zhing skyes), andfamily-born (rigs skyes). Mantra-born are qualified consorts having the same level of real-ization as the yogin, accomplished through the power of mantra practice. Field-born areconsorts of the sky-farer type, born in the thirty-two power places. Family-born are con-sorts who exhibit the insignia, colors, and mudras of the five families (CPR, f. 101b3-4).The insignia of a nine-pronged vajra at the base of the ring finger of the left hand anda dark complexion indicate affiliation with the Akshobhya family; a wheel and whitecomplexion indicate affiliation with the Vairochana family; a lotus and a reddish whitecomplexion, with the Amitabha family; a jewel and a yellow complexion, with theRatnasambhava family; and a sword and bluish complexion, with the Amoghasiddhifamily. A yellowish white complexion indicates affiliation with the Vajrasattva family(CH, ff. 315a2-317b2).In an alternative classification, consorts are of four types: innate, field-born, mantra-born, and action-born sky-farers. The innate, an exalted being who resides in the pureland of Unsurpassed (Akaniýîha), is the enjoyment dimension of awakening manifestingin the form of a goddess. The field-born is a practitioner endowed with unsurpassablecontemplation and manifests as a yogini in the thirty-two power places. Mantra-born isa practitioner who is trained in the mantric path and is born in a central land, and soforth, as a sky-farer. Action-born is a woman who in a previous existence has attained thepath through familiarization with the mantra way (CH, ff. 232a6-233a2).The types of consort to avoid and those to rely on are specified in Naropa’s Commen-tary on the Summary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation (Toh. 1351), ff. 238a4-239a4.65. Descendant joys (yas babs kyi dga’ ba) and ascendant joys (mas brtan gyi -): the joysthat occur as the vital essence descends from the top of the head, and the joys that occuras the vital essence is held (not emitted as semen) and drawn up from the genitals to thetop of the head.66. The pristine awareness consort (ye shes kyi phyag rgya, jñ›namudr›) is an imaginaryconsort (yid kyi rig ma) who does not exist in reality but is conceptually represented. Tounite means to meditate on the male and female deities in union (CPR, f. 101b5-6).67. In both the secret initiation and the pristine awareness through wisdom initiation, theeyes of the consort (who must be between twelve and twenty-five years of age) and that ofthe student are covered in order to avoid possible shame, doubts, and other kinds of incon-gruous thoughts. In addition, the white and red substances derived from the master’s unionwith the consort are not to be seen with the eyes or touched with the hands, but placeddirectly into the mouth of the student in order to generate bliss (CH, ff. 155b4-156a1).NOTES TO PAGES 230 TO 232\u0002473"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"474\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA68. The great seal possessing seven features (yan lag bdun ldan gyi phyag rgya chen po),more often expressed as the state of Vajradhara possessing the seven features of union(kha sbyor yan lag bdun ldan rdo rje ’chang). Devachandra’s Illumination of Pristine Aware-ness-Wisdom lists them in the following way: total enjoyment (longs spyod rdzogs); union(kha sbyor); great bliss (bde ba chen po); devoid of intrinsic nature (rang bzhin med pa);filled with compassion (snying rje nges gang); an unending stream (rgyun mi ’chad pa);and an unobstructed presence (’gog pa med pa).Devachandra states that the seven features represent pristine awareness, the indivis-ibility of emptiness and compassion. Such pristine awareness is, one, total enjoyment orexperience in that it manifests as the totality of things that arise through interdepen-dence; two, a union in that it is the perfect inseparability of emptiness and compassion;three, great bliss as it is free from all concepts regarding existing and not existing; four,devoid of intrinsic nature in being unborn; five, filled with compassion as it is of thenature of compassion (i.e., immutable bliss); six, an unending stream as its stream iseternal; and seven, an unobstructed presence as it is free from obstacles (Illumination ofPristine Awareness-Wisdom, Toh. 2226, vol. Wi, f. 83a3-b1).Kongtrul presents the seven from another perspective: one, the total enjoyment ofpossessing thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of an awakened one; two, theunion with the consort who is a manifestation of one’s pristine awareness; three, thegreat bliss of abiding as the essence of great bliss; four, devoid of intrinsic nature inabiding as the essence of emptiness without mental fabrications; five, filled with com-passion in being permeated always by non-objectifying compassion for all beings; six,an unending stream in being an eternal unfolding of the dimensions of awakeningand pristine awareness; and seven, an unobstructed presence—freedom from inter-ruptions to mind’s absorption in cessation without any form and to the form dimen-sion of awakening (IOK, vol. III, p. 658).69. See Chapter 10, n. 23.70. Generally speaking, the seven Kalachakra initiations in the pattern of childhoodserve as direct ripening factors for the phase of generation and as indirect ripening fac-tors for the phase of completion. The four higher initiations serve as direct ripeningfactors for the phase of completion and indirect ripening factors for the four dimensionsof awakening (k›ya). In reality, the pristine awareness of the fourth initiation is thephase of completion itself and the four dimensions of awakening.The higher initiations (dbang gong ma) in the Kalachakra system are the four—vase,secret, pristine awareness through wisdom, and the fourth initiation. The first threeinitiations are called mundane (’jig rten pa), and the fourth, supramundane (’jig rten las’das pa).The vase initiation consists in the experience of the pristine awareness of bliss thatarises as the vital essence shifts (’pho ba) and descends from the crown of the head to theforehead through the passion aroused by touching the breast of a wisdom woman (shesrab ma). The bliss experienced has the nature of the initial fourfold joy (dga’ ba, ›nanda)of body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness. The term “vase” indicates the breast ofthe consort which by touching stimulates bliss; hence, the name “vase initiation.” Thispristine awareness of bliss is symbolized by a child (byis pa) to indicate that it is new,slight, and unsteady."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"The secret initiation consists in the experience of the pristine awareness of bliss thatarises as the vital essence shifts and descends from the forehead to the throat and then tothe heart as a result of tasting the bodhichitta from the master and consort in union andseeing the fully blossomed lotus of the consort. The supreme joy (param›nanda) experi-enced is a bliss that lasts longer than that experienced in the vase initiation and is of fourkinds, as is the above joy. This bliss is symbolized by a “youthful person” (lang tsho ’amdar ma) to indicate that although it is more expanded than the previous, it is still unrip-ened.In the third initiation, the master offers the consort to the student, who holds herhands and enters into union with her. This, initially, causes the vital essence to shift fromthe heart and descend to the base of the genital area where it produces separation fromjoy (dga’ bral); then causes the vital essence to move from the base of the genital area tothe penis where it gives rise to innate joy (lhan skyes kyi dga’ ba, sahaj›nanda), also distin-guished as four kinds. The initiation here consists in the experience of the pristine aware-ness of bliss that arises as the vital essence flows to the tip of the penis. This bliss issymbolized by an elderly person (rgan pa) to indicate that although it is ripened and lastslonger than in the previous two initiations, and hence special, in the end it does notbecome stable.All the three types of bliss experienced in the first three initiations are unstable andmutable, unlike the one of the fourth which is stable and immutable. The fourth initia-tion consists in an immutable blissful pristine awareness born from the passion directedat the great seal of the empty form which binds the vital essence and reverses its courseupward and thus produces an unfluctuating bliss. This is not the bliss born from relyingon an action seal or imaginary seal, or from conceptual meditation. Such bliss is symbol-ized by the “progenitor of beings” (skye dgu’i bdag po), who is the source of countlessfamily lineages in the world. According to the view of Hindu fundamentalists, this pro-genitor is Brahma or another god, the creator of all beings and the world, to whom all,in the end, return. Likewise, the immutable bliss characterized by the nature of reality,which is the ground of all cyclic life and perfect peace, is the progenitor, that is, thebuddha. Being characterized by the knowledge of reality, it is the source of all buddhas.In the Kalachakra, the water initiation and the others are called the seven initiationsin the pattern of childhood. They are not called vajra master initiations or vase initia-tion; here, the vase initiation is, in all respects, a higher initiation.Thus, the initiations are of two types: the seven in the pattern of childhood and thehigher four. In consideration of the type of student being initiated, they are classified asmaster and student initiations. In consideration of the level of pristine awareness in-volved, they are classified as mundane and supramundane. Moreover, the higher initia-tions are twofold. The first set of four higher initiations is conferred on students in orderto cause them to enter the way of tantra so that they may fully comprehend the path tobe followed and to authorize them to listen to the tantras. The second set serves thepurposes of conferring the status of great vajra master and authorizing students to giveteachings.The second set, the master’s initiation, has two subdivisions: four initiations for thesovereign vajra master and four for the great sovereign vajra master. In the case of any ofthe three types of higher initiations (those of the student, the sovereign vajra master, andthe great sovereign vajra master), if the person who is being initiated has not attained theNOTES TO PAGES 232 TO 233\u0002475"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"476\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAlevel of the branch of contemplation of the sixfold yogas, the first three initiations aremundane and the fourth, supramundane. If he has attained that level, all four aresupramundane. In addition, such a person does not need the student initiations or thoseof the sovereign vajra master but only those of the great sovereign vajra master. Therituals for all three sets of the four higher initiations, except for differences in the lengthof its components, are, for the most part, similar. Source: Taranata’s CSI, ff. 20a1-25a7.There are, however, many differing assertions concerning classification, order of con-ferral, and purpose of the Kalachakra’s higher initiations; see, for instance, KedrupNorzang’s Detailed Elucidation of the Kalachakra Tantra, ff. 115a2-132b1; and LongdolLama’s Kalachakra Tantra’s Sets of Terms According to Tsongkapa’s Treatises on the Subject,pp. 142-144.71. Taranata classifies the Kalachakra initiations in several different ways. In a threefoldclassification, one set comprises the seven initiations in the pattern of childhood; oneset, the four high initiations; and one set, the initiations of the master which confer thestatus of a vajra master.In a twofold classification, one set comprises the student initiations (seven in thepattern of childhood and the four higher initiations, eleven in total) and the second set,the master’s initiations (of the sovereign vajra master and the great sovereign vajra mas-ter). The higher are each divided into vase, secret, pristine awareness through wisdom,and word initiation, for a total of twelve. Another twofold classification divides initia-tions into mundane (all initiations with the exception of the fourth) and transmundane(the actual fourth initiation).In a threefold classification, one set comprises the initiations of the student; one set,those of the sovereign master; and one set, the initiations of the great sovereign master.The initiations are also considered from the perspective of cause, path, and result. Causalinitiations are those taken by oneself or conferred by the master, which ripen, purify, andcontribute to the accumulation of merit but cannot bring about advancement in termsof levels of realization. Path initiations are those that, as their direct result, allow one toadvance to higher levels of realization, such as stability in the phase of generation, theattainment of the state of awareness-holder, gaining of powers, success in the six-branchedyoga, attainment of an exalted state, and so on. The resultant initiation is one conferredby the enjoyment dimensions of enlightened beings just as one is about to fully awaken.Source: Taranata’s Explanation of the Mandala Rite of Kalachakra, Collected Works, vol.3, ff. 10b6-11b1. See also Taranata’s Elucidation of the Indestructible Way, Collected Works,vol. 8, f. 17b2-4.72. In the Indestructible Garland (Toh. 445, f. 212b4), the first three initiations (vase,secret, and pristine awareness) are considered as the cause, and the latter one, the wordinitiation, as the result. The Essence of the Great Seal (Toh. 420) makes this same asser-tion at f. 67a4-6.73. Self-blessing (rang byin rlabs, sv›diýîh›na): an aspect of the phase of completion thataims at direct experience of the pristine awareness of the four joys, the innate joy inparticular, through practices based exclusively on one’s body as opposed to the mandalacircle (dkyil ’khor ’khor lo) aspect of the phase of completion, which relies on another’sbody (that of the consort) (MH, f. 79a5-6). In a threefold system, the phase of comple-tion comprises relative self-blessing, ultimate luminous clarity of the great seal, and their"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"inseparability or union. Here, self-blessing includes all aspects of the inner fire and illu-sory body. See Chapter 13, section entitled “Causal Phase of Completion.”74. Concerning the example (dpe) and actual (don) pristine awareness or luminous clar-ity (’od gsal), see above, n. 62.75. Three contemplations: initial union, the supremely triumphant mandala, and su-premely triumphant act. See Chapter 5, n. 29.76. Illusory body (sgyu lus) consists in the actual arising of the body of the deity (and itsmandala) from the wind-mind of luminous clarity through the bliss of melted vitalessence brought about by the winds merging with the indestructible vital essence at theheart. The illusory body is of several types; at this stage, it is impure (ma dag pa) as it hasnot yet been purified of emotional afflictions. For an extensive discussion, see IOK, vol.III, pp. 136-159. The pure illusory body is attained as soon as one arises from the stateof absorption in the actual luminous clarity in which the emotional afflictions have beenremoved. The illusory body is so called because it is a body, or form of a deity, composedonly of the most subtle wind and mind and is exemplified by the twelve examples ofillusion (Akya Yongdzin’s Presentation of the Paths and Stages of the Glorious Guhyasamaja,p. 68).77. Vajra recitation (rdo rje’i bzlas pa, vajraj›pa): a name for breathing practice associatedwith syllables; also a stage corresponding to speech-isolation (ngag dben) in the five-stageformat of the phase of completion set forth in the Guhyasamaja tantra and other tantras.Although there are many types of vajra recitation, all serve similar functions: looseningthe coarser knots of the channel-wheels; purifying the channels; bringing the winds intothe central channel; and binding them to the vital essence therein. For an extensivediscussion, see IOK, vol. III, pp. 136-159.78. Union (zung ’jug) is of two types: union with training and union beyond training(mi slob pa’i zung ’jug). At this point, one trains in order to attain union beyond training,i.e., union of the pure illusory body and actual luminous clarity. It is characterized as agreat union exemplifying highest freedom and realization. Freedom refers to the knowl-edge that all obscurations and their habitual tendencies have been exhausted. Realiza-tion refers to the nonconceptual understanding of all phenomena of cyclic existence andperfect peace, such as the ground, path, and result, as images in a divination mirror(IOK, vol. III, p. 657). Luminous clarity that has merged with essential reality meansthat the luminous clarity is totally united with essential reality in being a direct realiza-tion of that.79. Dharmashri presents a summation of the spheres of purification of the four initia-tions: Since the aggregates of the body and other appearances of the waking state arecoarse phenomena, from among the vital essences of the three doors of existence (sgogsum), the vase initiation purifies obscurations of the body’s vital essence and purifies thewaking state. Of the four demons, this initiation purifies the demon of the aggregates.Since what manifests in the dream state is subtle, and dream manifests due to vitalessence being stirred by wind, or since dream is related to conceptions that stimulatetalking, the secret initiation purifies the vital essence of speech and the dream state, aswell as purifying the demon of emotional afflictions. Since deep sleep is a state thatoccurs when the coarse sixfold collection of consciousnesses has stopped, the pristineNOTES TO PAGES 233 TO 235\u0002477"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"478\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAawareness through wisdom initiation purifies the vital essence of mind and the state ofdeep sleep, as well as purifying the demon of death. Since the state of sexual union is oneof craving for the bliss of dispersion, the fourth initiation purifies the obscuration re-lated to the emission of vital essence which is the very subtle obscuration to knowledge,as well as purifying the demon of the god-child.By purifying the obscurations of the emotional afflictions, the enjoyment dimensionis achieved; by purifying karmic obscurations, the manifest dimension is achieved; andby purifying the obscurations related to pristine awareness, the reality dimension ofawakening is achieved. The vase initiation purifies karmic obscurations; the secret initia-tion purifies emotional afflictions; the pristine awareness initiation purifies coarserobscurations to knowledge; and the fourth initiation purifies the subtle obscuration ofthe habitual tendency for emission. It can also be said that the first three initiationspurify the three planes of existence, respectively; the fourth purifies them all equally. Topurify equally means that since the body, speech, and mind of cyclic existence, as well aspleasure, suffering, and indifference, all arise from the three qualities of white essence,red essence, and wind, this initiation purifies the habitual tendency for emission of vitalessence together with the mind associated equally with the white, red, and wind aspects.The vase initiation authorizes one to listen, teach, and practice the outer and inneraspects of the phase of generation, along with the associated rituals. It brings about theexperience of the appearance and emptiness of objects manifesting as a union. The secretinitiation authorizes one to cultivate self-blessing, inner heat, and illusory body, andbrings about the experience of mind’s clarity and emptiness manifesting as a union. Thepristine awareness initiation authorizes one to cultivate the example pristine awarenessby reliance on action and imaginary consorts and brings about the experience of thebliss and emptiness of body through the bliss of the melted vital essence. The fourthinitiation authorizes one to cultivate the actual pristine awareness of the great seal andgreat perfection and brings about the direct experience of supreme immutable bliss, theultimate luminous clarity which is the natural condition of all things, as the nature ofone’s own pure and total presence. By establishing potencies which are then developedthrough the two phases, these initiations enable one to attain, through whatever provi-sional powers, the ultimate power of the four dimensions of awakening in the nature ofthe four indestructible states of awakened body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness(VOWS, ff. 244a5-245b1).80. See KT, pp. 109-117.81. See CH, ff. 114a2-119b3. Kongtrul explains that an actual tantric feast gathering(tshogs kyi ’khor lo, gaòacakra) (lit. wheel of gathering) comprises a group of yogins andyoginis equal in number to the male and female figures found in the mandala of thetantric deity being practiced. The tantric feast is performed on different occasions, suchas the eighth and tenth days of the waxing moon, dates on which offerings have a specialsignificance. Yogins and yoginis perform the feast ritual at night at a suitable isolatedplace, such as the meeting place of sky-farers, the outskirts of a town, in a temple, cem-etery, empty cave, at the foot of a tree, or edge of a forest. Depending on its type andpurpose, the ritual feast may last a night, a month, or three years and three fortnights.The different purposes include to make offerings to worldly and transworldly sky-farers,to perform an initiation ritual, and to allow a friendly gathering of tantric practitioners."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"The ritual feast is a means of enhancing the realization that has been gained in thepersonal practice of the yogin or yogini.Once the place has been chosen (some tantras specify that the hidden ritual feasthouse be three stories high, below the ground, or one half above the ground, etc.), themandala is drawn, and the yogins and yoginis take their places on corpses, tiger skins, orother kinds of seats, surrounding the central figure, the yogin or yogini who is leader ofthe feast. The offerings, the five nectars and the five meats, alcohol, and so forth, areconsecrated according to the appropriate ritual and then enjoyed by the congregation asan “inner fire offering” to the deities of the body mandala of each participant. Theyogins and yoginis enjoy food and drink while imagining them to pervade all theirpsychophysical constituents and thereby generating bliss. While in the state of medita-tive absorption, the yogin and yogini, having entered into union, experience the fourjoys while retaining the vital essence, and remain absorbed in the state of coemergentbliss and emptiness. Arising from the absorption, they see all appearances as illusions,and whatever appears manifests as the form of the deity. Then the yogins and yoginiscontinue to enjoy the feast while sharpening their senses with reciprocal offerings, dances,music, songs, symbolic language, and mudras.Celebrations of heroes (dpa’ bo ston mo) are gatherings of mostly yogins; and celebra-tions of heroines (dpa’ mo’i ston mo), gatherings of mostly yoginis. A ritual feast in whichone relies on an imaginary consort and only imaginatively creates the presence of thenumber of female and male figures of the mandala is an imitation of a tantric feastgathering and is the style of the ritual feasts of present-day mantra practitioners (IOK,vol.

In the phase of generation, one trains in yoga that corresponds to the process of thearising and destruction of existence, the yoga of the vital essence (thig le’i rnal ’byor) andthe subtle yoga (phra ba’i rnal ’rbyor). In the Kalachakra system, these two last yogascorrespond to the yoga that causes the descent of the vital essences and the yoga thatcauses their ascent. These are practiced by relying on an action or imaginary consort.The yogin causes the vital essence to descend and consequently experiences the fourjoys; and causes the vital essence to ascend and consequently experiences the four joys inthe reverse order, thus entering contemplation in the state of bliss.

Eight branches of yoga (rnal ’byor yan lag brgyad): the yoga of mantra (recitation); thefood offering (tor ma, bali) (to eliminate obstacles); the yoga of partaking of food anddrink (to create merit); the yoga of passion practiced with an action consort; the yoga ofconduct between formal sessions of meditation (to purify one’s behavior); the yoga ofsleep (to transform sleep into virtue); the yoga of waking up at dawn; and the yoga ofwashing for the purpose of purification (IOK, vol. III, p. 199).3. See Chapter 5, n. 29.4. Kongtrul specifies that the four branches (yan lag bzhi) are primarily taught in theGuhyasamaja tantra. Followers of Nagarjuna’s system of Guhyasamaja consider the branchof familiarization (bsnyen pa) to be the meditation pertaining to the phase of generationup to and including the first factor for actual awakening (the visualization of the lotusand the moon and sun disks). It is known as “familiarization” because the pristine aware-ness one cultivates at this stage effects familiarization of emptiness. Near attainment(nyer sgrub) is everything from that point up to the completion of the mandala of thebody. It is known as “near attainment” because there is the attainment of the enjoymentdimension (sambhogak›ya) of mantra, which is nearly the enjoyment dimension of pris-tine awareness, and because there is attainment of the sense fields of the deity. Then,everything up to the point of exhibiting passion is the branch of attainment (sgrub pa).It is “attainment” because there is attainment of the union of one’s body, speech, andmind with the three indestructible states of the buddhas. Great attainment (sgrub pachen po) is everything from the presentation of offerings up to the dissolution of theentire mandala. It is “great attainment” because it brings about others’ benefit in greatmeasure, activates the various effects of the mantra of the respective deity, establishes thethree beings (ting nge ’dzin sems dpa’; ye shes sems dpa’; dam tshig sems dpa’), and bringsabout the crowning of oneself (as the deity) with the lord of the family. See IOK, vol. III,pp. 177-179. For the four branches, familiarization, and so on, according to the KalachakraTantra, see Kedrup Norzang’s Detailed Elucidation, f. 139a2-5.The four yogas are yoga (rnal ’byor), subsequent yoga (rjes su rnal ’byor), intense yoga(shin tu rnal ’byor) and great yoga (rnal ’byor chen po). These are taught in the Yamaritantras, the Buddhasamayoga, Secret Moon Vital Essence Tantra, the Continuation of theGuhyasamaja Tantra, and the Vajra Garland. For a discussion of these, see IOK, vol. III,pp. 179-180.5. A beginner (las dang po pa) is one who, when cultivating all of the procedures of thephase of generation as set forth in the sadhana being practiced, is unable to have, evenfor a brief while, a clear vision of the entire gross form of the mandala.The practitioner who has experienced a slight descent of pristine awareness (ye shescung zad ’bab pa) is one who, when visualizing the divine palace and the gross forms ofthe deities residing in it, has a clear and stable vision of the limbs, and so forth, of thedeities all at once, but is unable to have the same clarity when visualizing the tiny deitiesin the sense powers of the gross deities.The practitioner who has gained a minimal degree of mastery with respect to pris-tine awareness (ye shes la cung zad dbang thob pa) is able to have a clear and stable vision"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"all at once not only of the gross deities but also of the limbs, and so forth, of the tinydeities.The practitioner who has achieved total mastery with respect to pristine awareness(ye shes la yang dag par dbang thob pa) is one who has perfected the phase of generationand reached the phase of completion (Kalka Ngawang Palden’s Presentation of the Stagesand Paths of the Four Sets of Tantras: Illumination of the Tantric Scriptures, pp. 111-112).6. See IOK, vol. III, pp. 167-168.7. For a detailed discussion of these points, see IOK, vol. III, pp. 159-275.8. Great [Heruka] Galpo Tantra (He ru ka gal po che’i rgyud), vol. 25, nos. 289-292, ofrNying ma rgyud ’bum (Collected Tantras of the Ancient Tradition) (hereafter cited as NGB).The Heruka Galpo is an ancient translation tantra of the cycle of Vishuddha (YangDag), awakened mind. The esoteric instructions of the path and fruit system of theSakyapa correspond to the exposition of the phase of completion found in the HerukaGalpo Tantra, which sets forth the structure of the four initiations, four obscurations,four paths, and so on. This indicates that the path and fruit system comprises esotericinstructions connected with that tantra. See NSH, p. 923. This is perhaps the reasonfor Kongtrul including the explanation of this ancient tantra in the context of the newtradition.9. See Chapter 8, section entitled “The Uncommon Explanation: The Special Feature inHighest Yoga Tantra.”10. See Chapter 12, n. 76.11. The phase of completion is characterized by innateness, nonconceptuality, and total-ity; all three are present equally in the ground, path, and result. In terms of the ground,innateness is twofold: the innate bliss arising from the melting of the vital essence andthe innate nature (rang bzhin lhan skyes). This last is the single binding nature of allphenomena, the beginningless and endless Vajrasattva, possessed of the distinctive qual-ity of being the union of emptiness and compassion. For a complete presentation, seeIOK, vol. III, pp. 159-275.12. Union (zung ’jug) refers to the inseparability of the two truths: the relative truthrepresented by self-blessing, which causes the body to manifest as the illusory body ofthe deity, and the ultimate truth represented by the mind entering its natural state throughthe practice of luminous clarity. Such union cannot be divided by concepts into relativeand ultimate: being of one taste, it is the inseparability of object (the supreme empti-ness) and subject (unchanging bliss), like milk mixed with water.There are two levels to the union. The union at the training stage (slobs pa’i zung ’jug)of cultivation of the path, in which the three empties, or three stages of light, are experi-enced in the process of their arising and reversal, is present from the first to the tenth stageof awakening. The union beyond training (mi slobs pa’i zung ’jug), free from the arisingand reversal processes of the three empties, is the ultimate pristine awareness dimension.It is also said that the arising as an illusory body from actual luminous clarity is thereal “union” and the arising as an illusory body from the example luminous clarity is aconcordant union (IOK, vol. III, pp. 273-275). See also note 17 of this chapter on thefive stages of Guhyasamaja.NOTES TO PAGES 240 TO 241\u0002481"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"482\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA13. The “three lights” (snang ba gsum) are three stages of experience of light: light (snangba, ›loka), increase of light (mched pa, ›lok›bh›sa), and full culmination of light (nyerthob pa, ›lokaupalabdha). During the path, these manifest as a result of the wind andvital essences being gathered into the central channel. When this occurs, at first there isthe appearance of the five signs (mirage, smoke, luminous space, flame, and a cloudlesssky) due to the successive merging of earth, water, fire, wind, and consciousness. Thenthe four “empties” occur successively. In the cloudless sky of the fifth sign, there is the“light” of emptiness, which is like moonlight. Then, there is the “increase of light” ofemptiness, which is like sunlight. Then, there is the “full culmination of light” of “thegreat empty,” which is like the pervasive darkness of night. Finally, there is the luminousclarity or “the total empty,” which is like the sky at dawn, free from the three conditionsthat can affect its clarity (IOK, vol. III, p. 271). See chapter 14, section entitled “Lights.”The three thoroughly afflicted lights (kun nas nyon mongs pa) refers to those experiencedby a practitioner who has not yet overcome emotional afflictions; the purified lights,those experienced by one who has overcome them.14. Possibly the first three joys, excluding the fourth, the innate joy.15. The yoga of vital essence (thig le’i rnal ’byor, binduyoga) here refers to the meditationin which, while visualizing oneself as the deity and focusing on the channel-wheels ofthe body, one holds the winds at the navel and causes the vital essence to melt anddescend. The subtle yoga (phra mo’i rnal ’byor, sákýamayoga) refers to the meditation inwhich one focuses the mind on the subtle insignia of the five buddhas visualized in thecenters of the channel-wheels (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 287b1-2).16. See Chapter 10, n. 37.17. The five stages set forth in the Guhyasamaja Tantra are the following: speech isola-tion (ngag dben) or vajra recitation (rdo rje’i bzlas pa); mind isolation (sems dben); illusorybody (sgyu lus) or self-blessing (rang byin rlabs); luminous clarity (’od gsal); and union(zung ’jug). Some speak of an additional stage, that of body isolation (lus dben), which isconsidered to be included in speech isolation as its preliminary. (Others include bodyisolation in the generation phase as its subtle result).In the stage of speech isolation, the principal winds, especially the life wind, aremade to enter, abide in, and dissolve in the central channel. In the mind isolationstage, through the force of meditation, the winds that serve as the mounts for concep-tions merge for brief periods in the channel-wheels. Due to this, and from the stabili-zation of the vital essences, there arises the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness.In the third stage, that of the illusory body, there manifests the illusory form of themandala circle of the deity. Its primary cause is the wind and mind of luminous clar-ity; its secondary condition, the melting-bliss arising from wind and mind merging inthe indestructible vital essence. In the fourth stage, that of luminous clarity, whosenature is the path for attaining the direct realization of the emptiness of innate greatbliss, the winds of the emotional afflictions and their seeds are vanquished. The fifthstage, union, consists in the pristine awareness that has accomplished the inseparabil-ity of the great bliss that directly realizes the essential condition and the infinite pris-tine awareness mandala. There are two “unions”: the union at the training stage,subdivided into the ten or twelve stages of awakening, and the union beyond training,"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"the five pristine awarenesses and the four dimensions of awakening (IOK, vol. III, pp.224-227).Concisely stated, vajra recitation at the stage of speech isolation serves as purifier ofthe winds. Mind isolation purifies the mind. Self-blessing cultivates the impure illusorybody created from mind and wind alone. The illusory body is purified by entering lumi-nous clarity through the total dissolution or sequential dissolution of that illusory bodyand its environment. As a result of this, there arises the dimension of union with thepure illusory body (VOWS, f. 228a2-3).18. Perhaps a reference to the Chakrasamvara four-stage yoga in the Krishnacharya tra-dition, consisting of the foundation stage of tantra (rtsa ba rgyud kyi rim pa) (the rootyoga which is the basis of all practices, for which the essential instructions deal exclu-sively with the foundation content of the tantra); the stage known as mantra (sngagskyi rim pa) (the practice of the inner heat yoga, for which the secret instructions relateequally to the channels, winds, and vital essences); the stage of arising of pristineawareness (ye shes kyi rim pa) (the yoga of the descent of the vital essences); and thesecret stage (gsang ba’i rim pa) of the result (training in entering and arising fromluminous clarity through mastery over the descent and reversal of the vital essence). SeeIOK, vol. III, p. 247.19. The shape (dbyibs), mantra (sngags), and reality (chos) tradition of the completionphase is that of Mahamaya. Shape refers to a simplified procedure for the generationphase as a basis for the completion phase. Mantra refers to training in meditation on thechannel-wheels, vital essences, and winds. Nature refers to meditation related to appear-ances, dreams, and the state between death and rebirth. These aspects also appear in thecompletion phase of other tantras (IOK, vol. III, p. 254).20. This reference to the channels, winds, and vital essences does not pertain to a par-ticular tradition of the completion phase, but denotes the main elements of practicefound in all systems of the completion phase. For instance, mother tantras teach that inorder to attain realization, one must stabilize the vital essences by striking crucial pointswithin the vajra body. In order to achieve stability of the vital essences, one must havecontrol over the winds. In order to achieve that, one has to have trained the channels. Itis therefore explained that one meditates upon these three, the channels, the winds, andthe vital essences, sequentially (IOK, vol. III, p. 260).21. The four seals (pledge seal, action seal, doctrine seal, and great seal) applied to thephase of completion are set forth in the Hevajra tantra as well as the Chakrasamvara. Inthe Hevajra, the pledge seal (dam tshig phyag rgya, samayamudr›) consists in the yoga ofthe subtle vital essences, which is based upon the winds; and the yoga of the blazing ofthe inner heat and dripping of the vital essence, which is based upon four and twochannel-wheels. The action seal (las rgya, karmamudr›) consists in practice with a realconsort or with an imagined one once one is able to experience bliss and emptinessrelying on one’s own body and thereby gain full control of the winds. When bliss hasbeen properly developed, the doctrine seal (chos kyi phyag rgya, dharmamudr›) is prac-ticed in order to seal all appearances with bliss. As a result of that, all phenomena be-come the great seal (phyag rgya chen po, mah›mudr›); having fully accomplished theexperience of the first three seals, or having gained at least some familiarity with them,NOTES TO PAGES 241 TO 242\u0002483"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"484\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAone meditates on the great seal through the six-branched yoga of withdrawal, and soforth (IOK, vol. III, pp. 240-241).As for the Chakrasamvara tantra according to the Ghantapa tradition (which is partof a fivefold completion phase), the pledge seal is the preliminary: the development ofjoy on the basis of meditation on the pristine awareness seal. The action seal is the mainpractice: the development of bliss on the basis of an actual consort. The doctrine seal isthe concluding practice: the maintaining of bliss through remembering what has previ-ously been experienced. The great seal is meditation on the meaning of suchness on thebasis of the other seals (ibid., p. 246).22. Generally speaking, these refer to initial yoga (rnal ’byor dang po), subsequent yoga(rjes su rnal ’byor), supreme yoga (shin tu rnal ’byor), and total yoga (rnal ’byor chen po).These yogas can be generally applied to any generation phase. However, they are verymuch associated with the completion phase of the Red Yamantaka, Black Yamantaka,and Vajrabhairava texts that were taught by the adept Shridhara. They are also spoken ofin relation to the completion phase of Tara Yogini (IOK, vol. III, pp. 230 and 256).23. Previous sections referred to here are IOK, vol. II, pp. 134-203; vol. III, pp. 48-109;and vol. III, pp. 508-566.24. See IOK, vol. III, pp. 508-533.25. The dissolution of the twenty-five coarse constituents—the five aggregates, fourelements, six sense faculties, five objects, and five pristine awarenesses of a human—isaccompanied by many signs. The way the four elements dissolve is as follows: When theearth element of the body dissolves into water, the external sign is the inability to movethe body and powerlessness to control it. The internal sign is the arising of a smoke-likeimpression. When water dissolves into fire, the external sign is the dehydration of sweat,saliva, and other body fluids. The internal sign is the arising of a mirage-like impression,and the cessation of thirty-three conceptions based on aversion. When fire dissolves intowind, the external sign is the withdrawing of the warmth of the body from the extremi-ties. The internal sign is the arising of an impression like the appearance of fireflies. Theforty conceptions that have developed from desire and attachment stop. When winddissolves into consciousness, the external sign is a long exhalation and an inability toinhale. The internal sign is the arising of an impression like the appearance of the flameof a butter-lamp undisturbed by the wind. The seven conceptions that are based ondelusion stop.Then, as to the way the subtle constituents (i.e., the three lights) dissolve, whenconsciousness dissolves into light, there arises the white radiance, a vision like moonlightshining in a cloudless sky. When light dissolves into the increase of light, there arises thered radiance, a vision like the sun shining in a cloudless sky. When the increase of lightdissolves into full culmination of light, there arises the black radiance, a vision like a skyfree from clouds and pervaded by thick darkness, like the beginning of night. At thatpoint, when memory deteriorates, confounded in darkness and blackness, one entersthe state of unconsciousness. When one awakens from that unconsciousness, the factorsthat adulterate the sky—moonlight, sunlight, and thick darkness—are absent. Therearises a vision like a perfectly clear sky in early dawn. This is luminous clarity (IOK, vol.III, p. 200)."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"The actual dissolution of these constituents occurs only at death and at the stage ofmind isolation (Kalka Ngawang Palden, Presentation of the Stages and Paths of the FourSets of Tantras, vol. 9, p. 135).26. Discussing this subject in the context of the sixfold yoga (where pranayama is thethird branch), Kongtrul explains that the expression srog rtsol (control of life) is derivedfrom the Sanskrit pr›ò›y›ma. It is also known as stopping life (srog ’gog pa). In this case,life (srog) is a name for wind (rlung, pr›òa), and to stop or control (rtsol) means to makethe life wind serviceable. The areas affected by wind control are the channels, winds, andvital essences, of which the principal are the three channels—lalana, rasana, and cen-tral—above the navel and the three channels for movement of feces, urine, and semenbelow the navel, plus the life wind and the downward-voiding wind.The nature of wind control is to block within the central channel the winds thatnormally flow in the lalana and rasana, to block in the conch-shell (shankhini) channelthe winds that flow in the channels for feces and urine, and similarly to unite into onethe flow of the life wind in the central channel and the flow of the downward-voidingwind in the conch-shell channel (IOK, vol. III, p. 235). 27. The Chakrasamvara tantra emphasizes the practice of wandering through speciallocalities known as power places (gnas, pitha) so that the yogin can summon, meet, andpractice with emissaries (pho nya mo, dát¦). These emissaries, who are at different levelsof realization, are the mantra-born (sngags skyes), field-born (zhing skyes), and innate(lhan skyes) emissaries. The innate are exalted beings who reside in the pure land ofUnsurpassed (Akaniýîha) as the enjoyment dimension of awakening manifesting in theform of goddesses. The field-born abide in unsurpassable contemplation and manifestas yoginis in the thirty-two power places. The mantra-born are trained in the mantricpath and are born in the central region (India), and so forth. To begin with, the yoginrelies on the mantra-born in order to assemble the field-born, and then relies on both.Finally, the yogin can meet innate emissaries and achieve the highest realization. For anextensive discussion, see IOK, vol. III, pp. 533-566.28. This is a reference to the winds that flow in the twenty-four major channels of thebody.29. The twenty-four residual vital essences flow in the twenty-four major channels of thebody. See Chapter 9, sections entitled “Channels” and “Vital Essences.”30. Awn of Esoteric Instructions (Toh. 1198), vol. Cha, ff. 1b-316a.31. Based on Naropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation, KedrupNorzang explains that the nature of the action seal (las kyi phyag rgya, karmamudr›) is areal woman with breasts and hair. Her “action” (las, karma) consists of kissing and embrac-ing the yogin, touching his secret parts, and so forth. She is a seal (phyag rgya, mudr›)because through her actions and by her own strength, she is the source of the mutable(’gyur ba, kýara) bliss, that is to say, bliss resulting from the emission of vital essence.The auxiliary of the action seal, the imaginary or pristine awareness seal (ye shes kyiphyag rgya, jñ›namudr›), is a goddess created in one’s own mind, such as Vishvamata,Kalachakra’s consort. She naturally bestows the moving (g.yo ba, spanda) bliss when oneimagines being in union with her. This bliss is called moving because it arises when thevital essences involved shift from one place to another of the body.NOTES TO PAGES 242 TO 246\u0002485"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"486\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe great seal (phyag rgya chen mo, mah›mudr›) refers to the female deity of theKalachakra in union, devoid of intrinsic existence and endowed with the supreme of allaspects, whose emanations pervade the three realms.

Maitripa (1007-1085), also known as Advayavajra, was a brahmin scholar whobecame a Buddhist when he met Naropa, who was evidently his first master. He be-came a monk at Vikramashila Monastery and studied with Shantipa and others. Hewas evicted from the monastery on the grounds of having been seen drinking beer inthe company of a woman. Later he became a student of the peerless yogin Savari.Maitripa is particularly linked with the transmission of mahamudra. His students in-clude Sahajavajra, Shunyatasamadhi, Vajrapani, Ramapala, and the Tibetans KyungpoNaljor and Marpa the Translator.

Sealing (rgyas ’debs) refers to a type of meditation in the generation phase in whichone seals the appearance of the circle of deities with bliss and emptiness. As a result ofthis, the appearance imagined as the form of the deity immediately arises as the essenceof bliss and emptiness. To do this, at all times of training in the phase of generation, onemust maintain the awareness that everything that appears to the mind, the mandala,simply appears relatively, that in essence there is nothing existing, ultimately emptiness(IOK, vol. III, p. 196).CHAPTER 14: THE RESULTANT PHASE OF COMPLETION AND THERESULTANT CONTINUUM1. The three lights, or three stages of experience of light (snang ba gsum): light, increaseof light, and culmination of light. Aryadeva explains that light (snang ba, ›loka) is char-acterized by a nature that is devoid of any aspect, without body or speech. It is like thefull moon which illuminates and pervades a cloudless autumn sky. Similarly, as naturalclarity, it focuses on all things without exception; hence, it is “light.” This is the ultimateawakening mind (bodhichitta), the light that pertains to wisdom, and the first empty(stong pa) (Lamp Summary of Tantric Practice, Toh. 1803, f. 77b3-4).Increase of light (snang ba mched, ›lok›bh›sa) is also characterized by a nature devoidof any aspect of subject and object duality, without body or speech. It is like an autumn"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"sky pervaded by the light of the sun. As a very luminous and immaculate essence, suchlight focuses on all things without exception. It is the awakening mind, ever-perfect, thesecond empty, characterized by being very empty (shin tu stong pa) (ibid., f. 77b6-7).Likewise, the culmination of light (snang ba thob pa, ›lokapalabdhi) has the charac-teristic of space, a form devoid of any entity, without body or speech. Like the obscuritythat descends at midnight, it is subtle and present everywhere, lacking self-identity. It isdevoid of movement since the movements of breath-control techniques are absent. It isdevoid of mental activity, unmoved. It is characterized by ignorance. This is the greatempty. These three lights are known as the three consciousnesses (ibid., f. 78a1-3).2. The ultimate three lights of essential reality (don dam de kho na nyid kyi snang ba); andthe relative three lights of interdependence (kun rdzob rten ’brel gyi snang ba).3.

Three lights that that occur at death (’chi ba’i dus kyi snang ba gsum); three lights thatoccur during sleep (gnyid dus); three lights that occur during sexual union (’khrig pa’idus); and three lights that occur when all the appearances of the sixfold group ofconsciousnesses arise (yul snang thams cad la ’char ba’i dus).7. Twenty-five gross constituents (rags pa nyer lnga). See below, the section of this chap-ter entitled “Appearance Side.”8. See Chapter 13, n. 25.9. Through the union of the male organ (method) and female organ (wisdom), firstcomes the sensation of hardness. This is the earth element. The nature of earth is igno-rance, the purity of which is said to be Vairochana, and hence, earth in its purity is thepristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena. The melting of vital es-sence is moisture, the water element whose nature is aversion, the purity of which mani-fests as Akshobhya, and is therefore the mirror-like pristine awareness. From love-making,there arises warmth, the fire element. The nature of heat is desire, the purity of which isthe vajra-holder Amitabha; hence, the fire element in its purity is the discerning pristineawareness. Wind and mind flow in the vagina. Such movement is the wind element andis of the nature of jealousy, the purity of which is Amoghasiddhi; hence, wind is thepristine awareness of accomplishment. The bliss of sexual union is the nature of blood,incited by the passionate mind. The joys that arise from this bliss have the nature ofspace. The element of space is avarice, the purity of which is Ratnasambhava, the vajra ofavarice which overcomes avarice; hence, the purity of space is the pristine awareness oftotal sameness.

Aryadeva states that in the tantras the Buddha used such terms in consideration ofbeings with little faith (Lamp Summary of Tantric Practice, Toh. 1803, f. 77b4-5).17. Literally, “natures” (rang bzhin, prakæt¦), so called as they are the natures or transfor-mations of the three lights, like momentary spots that obscure the three lights. Later inthis chapter, it is noted that their ultimate nature is that of the emptiness of bliss andluminous clarity. Aryadeva explains that these are called natures since they are of thenature of the pristine awareness of light, and so forth (Lamp Summary of Tantric Practice,Toh. 1803, f. 78b3).The first group of thirty-three natures or conceptions are said to be female and aregenerated by the wind in the left channel; the second group of forty are male, generatedby the wind in the right channel; the last group of seven are neuter, generated by thewind in the central channel.18.

According to the father tantras, in the phase of generation,the mantric conduct is applied by the yogin who has perfected the phase of generationin order to attain the common great powers. In the phase of completion, the conduct isapplied in order to attain the illusory body once mind and winds have been made ser-viceable; in order to generate the actual luminous clarity once the yogin has becomefamiliarized with the example luminous clarity; and in order to attain the union beyondtraining once union with training has been attained. In the mother tantras, mantricconduct is performed when the yogin gains signs of warmth of experience (the capacityto maintain clarity of mind even in states of fear, intoxication, suffering, misery, strongattachment, hatred, or torpor) through the practice of the two phases.The Guhyasamaja and Buddhasamayoga speak of three types of conduct: elaborate(spros bcas), unelaborate (spros med), and extremely unelaborate (shin tu spros med). Forthe elaborate conduct, the yogin (in a house built especially for the purpose) wears theornaments and attributes of the deity, and together with a number of yogins and yoginisequal in number to the deities of the mandala, performs the ganachakra (ritual feastoffering) four times daily and then practices the three concentrations, and so forth, withmuch activity, such as music, singing and dancing, and symbolic language. Through theenjoyment of sensory pleasures, this conduct enhances realization. For the unelaborateconduct, the yogin dispenses with the music, and so forth, and relies on consorts equalin number to the deities of the mandala, or five, or only one consort. A practitioner whoengages in the extremely unelaborate conduct, except when eating or defecating, reliesexclusively on the pristine awareness seal (MH, f. 70a2-b7).The conduct of forsaking duality (gnyis spang) is more often called “all-shaking” (kun’dar, avadhát¦), where “all-shaking” means “shaking off ” or “casting off ” dualisticthoughts. It consists of engaging in all kinds of activities that give rise to ordinary excite-ment: partaking of the five nectars and five meats, sexual union with consorts, and soforth. It is performed in secret or in disguise (i.e., while pretending to be crazy), either todeepen the yoga of the deity or to enhance the experience of luminous clarity. Thebeginner’s level at which this conduct is practiced requires having entered the path andhaving acquired a stable experience of pristine awareness.The ever-perfect (kun tu bzang po) conduct means that whatever action one does,good or bad, it is always perfect. This conduct is performed openly since the yogin hasattained stability, and it consists of leading others on the right path by displaying mi-raculous feats or gathering dakinis through power gazes and various other means. Theever-perfect conduct is adopted by an experienced practitioner, one who has experi-enced the setting of manifest conceptual constructs. Thus, it said that these two con-ducts, although performed throughout the entire way to awakening, are focused onmainly in the lower path of preparation.The victorious in all quarters (phyogs las rnam rgyal) conduct means to overcomeemotional afflictions and to acquire the strength to help others. This conduct entailsgathering goddesses, such as the goddess of water, and relying on them as one’s tantricconsorts to enable one to immediately attain the direct knowledge of reality on the pathof seeing. This is the main conduct to be performed by an accomplished practitioner,one who has attained a great degree of warmth on the path of preparation, indicatingthat attainment of actual pristine awareness is near, up until the attainment of full awak-ening (IOK, vol. III, pp. 543, 549-552)."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"40. The deliberate behavior of using desire (’dod ’jug) refers to the conduct observed bythe yogin between meditation sessions when enjoying food, drink, and other pleasures.If this conduct is not directly pervaded by nonconceptual pristine awareness, it is said tobe common; if it is pervaded, it is uncommon (IOK, vol. III, p. 536).Training in and enjoying desire (brten slob), emphasized in the father tantras, is totrain in and enjoy pleasures in conjunction with elaborate conduct. This means to culti-vate a conceptually based meditation in which one imagines whatever appears to be themale and female deities and to enjoy all sense objects one encounters. To train in andenjoy desire in conjunction with unelaborate conduct means to cultivate a meditation,only partially conceptually based, which sees one’s sense powers and sense objects asthose of the deity and to enjoy all objects while understanding that the deity is theappearance of one’s own mind. To train in and enjoy desire in conjunction with anutterly unelaborate activity means to contemplate the form of the deity as being themanifestation of bliss and emptiness and to enjoy sensory objects with the understand-ing that the deity and pleasures have no reality (ibid., pp. 536-537).41. For instance, the person of lesser faculties should practice the elaborate conduct; theaverage, the unelaborate conduct; and the person of higher faculties, the extremelyunelaborate conduct. For the way the various conducts are classified, see IOK, vol. III,pp. 533-566.42. See IOK, vol. III, pp. 533-566.CHAPTER 15: TANTRIC SCRIPTURES1. Sönam Tsemo speaks of two scriptural tantras (rjod byed tshig rgyud), the actual andthe nominal. He defines the first as a multitude of generic images that arise in one’sconsciousness in the aspects of names, words, and letters that convey the meaning of thethree continuums. Nominal scriptural tantras refers to the scriptures containing thetantras that serve as conditions for the arising of those appearances (mentioned above)in the mind (SGP, f. 61b1-2).2. See Chapter 3, section entitled “Divisions of Action Tantra.”3. Yakshini’s Kalpa (gNod sbyin ma’i rtog pa). Unidentified. Kalpa is a term for tantra,evidently originating in western India.4. Sönam Tsemo distinguishes between extensive and concise root tantras by explainingthat extensive tantras, for the most part, are the tantras that were taught during theactual promulgation of the teaching and were intended for the disciples present at thetime. Concise tantras are those taught principally in consideration of future studentswho would have short life spans and inferior intelligence and not be able to retain theextensive tantras (SGP, f. 36a6-b1).5. These three tantras are actually found in a single scripture, the Summation of EssentialPrinciples Tantra (Toh. 479). The identification and the subject matter of the Continua-tion (Uttaratantra) and Continuation of the Continuation (Uttarotantra) within the Sum-mation of Essential Principles Tantra is treated in IBTS, pp. 216-219. Butön states thatthis tantra is like a root for all yoga and highest yoga tantras (BGP, f. 285b2). This wouldexplain why it is placed here in this section, which concerns highest yoga tantra.NOTES TO PAGES 271 TO 275\u0002491"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"492\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRA6. Sönam Tsemo states that the explanatory tantras (bshad rgyud) of a particular class arethose that appeared after the root ones and are exegetical in nature. A root tantra (rtsaba’i rgyud, málatantra) is defined as the tantra that appeared first and that serves as thebasis for the explanatory ones (SGP, f. 36a5-6). Explanatory tantras are of two kinds,common and uncommon. The common kind clarifies several tantras, while the uncom-mon clarifies its own specific tantra (f. 36b1-2). Six kinds of explanatory tantras aredistinguished: elucidations; supplements; presentations of variations in aspects; summa-ries; ascertainments of similarities; and analyses of terms and meanings. See SGP, ff.36b2-37b1.7. Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra (Toh. 450), vol. Cha, f.10b5-6.8. A stanza may consist of two, three, four, five, or six lines, each called shloka (Ÿloka). Inscriptures of prose, nine syllables are called vajra faculty (vajra indriya); four of these arecalled shloka (SGP, f. 37b2-3).9. Indestructible Essence Ornament (Toh. 451, vol. Cha, f. 51a4-b2) mentions numerousnames of father tantras and their numbers of metrical lines.10. Indestructible Tent, Toh. 419, vol. Nga, f. 54b4-5. Kongtrul paraphrases the originalterse passage to facilitate understanding.11. The tantras mentioned in the passage are difficult to identify. Butön states that thispassage indicates thirteen or fourteen tantras (BGP, f. 288b3) and notes that few of thesetantras are found among the Tibetan translations. It seems that many tantras cited inIndian commentaries were not translated into Tibetan. There are also tantras mentionedin the book lists of the early translations which are no longer available (BGP, f. 288b4-5).12. The ten outer essential principles of tantric expertise enumerated in the Indestruc-tible Essence Ornament Tantra (Toh. 451, vol. Cha, f. 58a4) are the following: mandala,contemplation, seal, stance, seated position, recitation, fire offering, worship, ritual, anddissolution.These essential principles are explained in Tsongkapa’s Commentary on the Fifty Verseson Devotion to the Master: Fulfilling the Aspirations of Students as follows: (1) Mandalarefers to the form and formless mandala. (2) Contemplation refers to the three contem-plations, the initial union of the deity yoga, the supremely triumphant mandala, and thesupremely triumphant act. (3) Seal refers to the various seals of the deities. (4) Stancerefers to five stances—the left leg drawn in and the right leg extended, the reverse, theshanks of the legs held straight, legs apart mimicking the wings of a bird, and the soles ofthe feet together. [See Anandagarbha’s Illumination of the Summation of Essential Prin-ciples, Toh. 2510, Vol. Li, f. 254b2-5.] (5) Seated position refers to the vajra posture andother postures. (6) Recitation refers to the meditation on the deity in conjunction withvarious styles of repetition of mantra. (7) Fire offering is of four kinds (appeasing, etc.).(8) Worship consists of offerings and praises to the deity. (9) Ritual refers to protection,invitation of the deities, and so forth. (10) Dissolution refers to the concluding act ofrequesting the deity to depart (Collected Works of Tsongkapa, vol. Ka, f. 8a4-b1).The ten inner or secret essential principles of tantric expertise are the following: therituals of the two reversals; the secret initiation; the initiation of pristine awareness throughwisdom; the ritual of tearing apart the union of hostile forces; food offerings; vajra reci-"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"tation; the ritual to perform the fierce type of activation; consecration; and actualizationof the mandala (Indestructible Essence Ornament, f. 58a3-4).Tsongkapa states that the ten outer essential principles of tantric expertise apply tothe vajra master of the three lower tantras and the inner or secret essential principles areprimarily characteristic of the vajra master of the highest yoga tantra (Collected Works ofTsongkapa, vol. Ka, f. 8b1-2). He explains the inner essential principles in the followingway: (1) and (2) The two reversals consist of the ritual of turning away negative forcesthrough contemplation of the ten wrathful deities, and so forth, and through the draw-ing of protective wheels that are then worn by the practitioner around the neck. (3) and(4) Knowledge of the secret initiation and the pristine awareness through wisdom initia-tion implies knowledge of the vase and the word initiations. (5) Tearing apart the unionof body and mind means to drive away guardians of the enemies of the doctrine andthen to implement fierce rituals in order to terminate the power of enemies through thepower of concentration. (6) Food offerings (gtor ma, bali) refers to offerings to the worldlyprotectors. (7) Vajra recitation refers to the mental and verbal vajra recitation. (8) Theritual to perform the fierce activation means that if the adept has been initiated, is abid-ing in the pledges and commitments, has practiced according to the prescribed means ofattainment (s›dhana) for eighteen months or more, and yet has had no results, he maystrike the dagger to call upon the deities to bestow attainments. (9) Consecration refersto the blessing of temples and so forth. (10) Actualization of the mandala entails cre-ation of the mandala of the deities in front, veneration, entering into the mandala, andreceiving initiation and permission. Commentary on the Fifty Verses on Devotion to theMaster, ff. 7b5-8a4.13. The mystic staff (khaîvaºga) symbolizes the wisdom of emptiness, and in the Hevajratantra, Nairatmya, Hevajra’s consort. The small drum (cang te’u, çamaru) symbolizesthe method of compassion and resonates with the sound of great bliss. To hold themystic staff and the small drum is a symbol of the union of wisdom and method (CH,f. 96a5-b1). The symbolic bone ornaments (rus pa’i rgyan/ phyag rgya, aýîhiamudr›),known as seals (mudr›), are listed in various ways in the tantras and the treatises oftantric adepts. They are five in number, often with an additional sixth ornament. Touse the example of the Hevajra tantra, the five ornaments are the wheel-like (’khor lo)crown ornament (sometimes called crown jewel) (gtsug gi nor bu), which symbolizesAkshobhya and mirror-like pristine awareness; earrings (rna cha), symbolizing Amitabhaand pristine awareness of discernment; the necklace (mgul rgyan) symbolizingRatnasambhava and pristine awareness of total sameness; bracelets (lag gdu) and an-klets (gdu bu) symbolizing Vairochana and pristine awareness of the ultimate dimen-sion of phenomena; girdle (ske rags) symbolizing Amoghasiddhi and the accomplishingpristine awareness (CH, f. 66a6-b1). The additional ornament spoken of in varioustexts related to Hevajra is ash from a cremation ground smeared on the body (thal chen)(MH, f. 77b3).In the Chakrasamvara literature is found an additional ornament—the sacred threadworn by brahmins (tshangs skud). The Kalachakra and Chakrasamvara tantras and theadept Lohipa teach that the six ornaments represent the purity of the six perfections: thenecklace represents generosity; bracelets, ethics; earrings, patience; crown ornament,diligence; the sacred thread, meditation; and the girdle (or sacred ashes), wisdom (MH,f. 78a7).NOTES TO PAGES 275 TO 278\u0002493"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"494\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAKongtrul explains that these ornaments symbolize the yogin’s (or yogini’s) pledges:the yogin wears the crown ornament on the head in order not to forget to pay homage tothe vajra master who is “heavy” with qualities, the master who explains the training, andthe favored deity. The yogin wears the earrings as a reminder not to listen to others’words disparaging the master, and so forth; the necklace as a reminder never to strayfrom the inner and outer mantra recitations which protect the mind from conceptuallimitations; the bracelets and anklets as a symbol of the vow not to kill creatures; andthe girdle to symbolize the binding of the vital essence by relying on the outer andinner consort. For these reasons, the yogin always wears these ornaments which sym-bolize the five buddhas. According to the definitive meaning given in the StainlessLight, the crown and the other ornaments symbolize the fixing of the vital essence atthe crown of the head and at the other channel-wheels by binding the five winds (CH, ff.289b1-290a2).CHAPTER 16: EXPOSITION METHODS1. Most likely a reference to Buddhaguhya’s Commentary (Toh. 2671). Three commen-taries on the Dialogue with Subahu Tantra are listed in Dg.T. (rGyud, vol. Thu, Toh.2671, Toh. 2672, and Toh. 2673). Only the first bears the name of the author, that ofBuddhaguhya. Kedrupjé attributes the second (Toh. 2672) also to Buddhaguhya (seeIBTS). Likely the third one is also by the same author.2. Dg.T. lists two commentaries by Buddhaguhya on this tantra, one brief (Toh. 2662)and one extensive (Toh. 2663). The latter is likely the one referred to here.3. See Chapter 5, n. 4.4. Indestructible Peak (Toh. 480), vol. Nya, f. 146a2-4.5. Ibid., f. 292a1.6. Ibid., ff. 291b7-292a1.7. Added from BGP, f. 301a7-b1.8. This section on yoga tantra’s method of exposition is taken from Butön’s Survey ofYoga Tantra, ff. 58a6-59a3.9. The Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra (Toh. 447), an ex-planatory tantra on the Guhyasamaja, sets forth the seven ornaments, which are elabo-rated upon by Chandrakirti in his Illuminating Lamp. A two-page explanation of theseven ornaments is given by Shraddhakaravarman, entitled Revealing the Seven Orna-ments as Set Forth in the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra (Toh.1789), vol. A, ff. 8a-10a.10. Concerning the seven ornaments, Sönam Tsemo notes that the first two, the fiveintroductory remarks and four correct methods, are to be understood when discussingthe tantra sets, the origin of the tantra, and the meaning of the title. The six parameters,the four modes, and the two forms of teaching (group and individual) are explainedthrough the instructions that constitute the means of exposition of the tantra. The formsbased on examination of students and the two truths are comprehended through realiza-tion of the tantra (SGP, f. 72a2-3)."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"11. To give an example of how the title of a tantra relates to its content, in the case of theHevajra Tantra, in the title, the he in hevajra indicates the method of great compassionwhich serves as the cause for awakening. Referred to here is the compassion that doesnot conceive of any intrinsic nature. Vajra means to destroy, in the sense of eliminatingall conceptual limitations; alternatively, it means analysis as it represents the discrimina-tive wisdom that examines phenomena. The connectedness and continuity of the methodof great compassion and the wisdom of realizing emptiness constitute the very nature ofthe highest yoga tantra. Such a union of method and wisdom is known as hevajra.In terms of the general meaning, he denotes compassion represented by the clear andcomplete form of the deity; vajra denotes wisdom, the realization of the emptiness or lackof intrinsic nature of phenomena; thus, hevajra is the union of clarity and emptiness. As forthe concealed meaning, he indicates compassion, karuò› in Sanskrit, where ka is bliss andru, to hold; together, to hold or retain the bliss born from the inner heat or union withconsort. Vajra is emptiness, the object realized by the bliss; thus, hevajra is the union ofbliss and emptiness. In the ultimate sense, he is enjoyment or play, passing beyond theextreme of perfect peace by means of great compassion, which always enjoys working forothers’ welfare in cyclic life. Vajra means passing beyond the extreme of cyclic life throughthe profound wisdom that shatters all objectifications in the realization of the nature ofreality. Hevajra is thus the union of method and wisdom beyond the two extremes.In a different explanation, he is karuò›, where ka means bliss and ruò›, stainless; thatis, immutable great bliss, the subject. Vajra is the emptiness endowed with the supremeof all aspects, the object. Hence, hevajra is the essential dimension of awakening(svabh›vikak›ya), the indivisibility of the four dimensions (k›ya), the union of e andvam (CH, ff. 13a6-14a4).12. The Guhyasamaja as found in Dg.K. (Toh. 442, ff. 90a-148a) has seventeen chapters.The eighteenth constitutes the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja (Toh. 443, ff. 148-157).13. Four correct methods (rigs pa bzhi), also known as four correct methods for enlight-enment (’tshang rgya ba’i rigs pa bzhi). Butön calls these correct methods “four ways ofawakening” (’tshang rgya ba’i tshul bzhi) (BGP, f. 301b6).14. This is a pledge of the Amitabha family, especially in the context of yoga tantra. Asan expression, it means observance of all kinds of Buddhist teachings, from the sutras tothe tantras. “Outer” likely refers to the three spiritual ways of proclaimers, solitary sages,and bodhisattvas; “inner,” to action, conduct, and yoga tantras; and “secret,” to highestyoga tantra.15. Pure conduct (tshangs spyod) generally means celibacy; in this context, however, itmeans retaining the bodhichitta of the union of method (vajra) and wisdom (lotus); or,the non-emission of bodhichitta as semen (which is the cause of immutable bliss) while“churning” in the lotus of the consort.

Concerning the six parameters, Kongtrul states that the provisional (drang don) andinterpretable (dgongs pa can) meanings are used when the subject matter concerns therelative truth. The definitive (nges don) and non-interpretable (dgongs pa can ma yin pa)meanings are used when the subject matter concerns the ultimate truth. Standard andcoined terminologies are used in scriptural tantras that convey the subject matter of thetantras (CPR, f. 12b3-4).19. On this mode, Sönam Tsemo points out that even though the meaning of the actualtext may not be obvious, it can be understood by separating one letter from another,splitting a syllable, or studying the shapes of the letters.In the first case, take, for instance, the Sanskrit nagaha asvha. To understand thesense of the words, one takes na separately, from which is derived nar, which meanshuman; and ga separately, from which is derived gabi, meaning ox.In the second case, the syllable háô, for example, means beyond subject and object.To reach an understanding of such meaning from this syllable, háô is split into ha, fromwhich is derived gr›haka or apprehended object. From ha is also derived grah›ja orapprehending mind. The hu in háô becomes Ÿu and from it Ÿunyata (“empty”) is de-rived. The dot on the háô is ma from which is derived manota, meaning mind. Thus,the háô signifies “mere mind empty of subject and object.”In the third case, take, for instance, evam maya, which refers to the navel, heart,throat, and head channel-wheels (chakra), and so forth. The letters do not explain suchmeaning, but it is possible to comprehend this through the correspondence between theshapes of the letters and the shapes of the channel-wheels. For instance, the three cornersof the e signify the navel’s channel-wheel, which has a similar triangular shape (SGP, ff.64b5-65a3).20. The lines are from the Guhyasamaja (Toh. 442, vol. Ca, f. 96a2), which reads: rinchen kha dog sna lnga pa/ yungs kar gyi ni ’bru tshod tsam/ sna yi rtse mor nan tan du/ rnal’byor rig pas rtag tu sgom. This citation relates to the “subtle yoga” (phra ba’i rnal ’byor) asdescribed in the generation phase of the Guhyasamaja. Lilavajra explains that the “tip ofthe nose” refers to the “tip of the nose” of the lotus of the female deity. There, emanatedfrom the bodhichitta (semen) of the male deity, one visualizes a vajra or other symbol,the size of a mustard seed. Within the vajra, one contemplates the entire mandala ofresidence and the mandala of resident deities. “Precious” means “very valuable.” “Of fivedifferent colors” means that they are symbols or insignia (vajra, etc.) that arise from thefive families. “Always” means day and night.

Expositions according to instructions for general meaning (spyi yi don gyi man ngaggis bshad pa), concealed meaning (sbas pa’i don -), and final meaning (mthar thug pa’i don -);and literal meaning (yi ge’i don -), auxiliary meaning (yan lag gi don -) and inclusivemeaning (bsdus pa’i don -).The general meaning is that which applies to both the way of the perfections andway of mantra, such as the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening, the five paths,the ten stages, and so forth, which are taught in the way of the perfections. It is generalbecause it removes the regret of those who have entered the way of the perfections and istaught in the scriptures of the secret mantra as well. It includes the general meaning ofthe phase of generation consisting in the vase initiation and connected branches. Thismeaning is called general because it must be trained in by both those who wish to accom-plish ordinary powers and those wishing to reach the supreme power (awakening).The concealed meaning is so called because it is not taught to those who have re-ceived the vase initiation alone and is to be known only by trainees who have receivedthe three higher initiations. As to method, the concealed meaning consists in the steps ofself-blessing and the circle of the mandala. As to bodhichitta, it consists in relative andultimate bodhichitta. As to pristine awareness, it consists in natural, innate pristine aware-ness. Concisely stated, concealed teachings are all those given with reference to thethree mandalas of body, bhaga, and bodhichitta. The descriptions of the gross andsubtle body of channels relate to the body mandala. The descriptions of the natures ofthe vajra and lotus of method and wisdom and the channels as letters relate to thebhaga mandala. The descriptions of the natures of the relative vital essence and thecontemplation of bliss and emptiness relate to the bodhichitta mandala. Teaching onpristine awareness wind as the means of cultivating such contemplation is an auxiliaryaspect of the concealed meaning.The final meaning refers to teachings concerning the path that actualizes the finalresult, that of the pristine awareness of a buddha, which has features not set forth in thesutras.Auxiliary meaning refers to explanations of the words that actually appear in thetantra in accordance with how they are commonly known, how they are known inlanguage treatises, and their semantic meanings.The literal meaning refers to explanations of the words to convey understandingwhen the words do not stand up to reason. The words are explained by examining theirderivatives, by separating the syllables, or comparing the shapes of the letters.Inclusive meaning refers to explanations according to esoteric instructions used whenthe words in the tantras have been coined by the Buddha and are not known by commonpeople of the world nor found in the treatises. For example, alcohol is referred to by com-mon people as simply alcohol and in the treatises as “intoxicator” (myos byed) , while inthe terminology coined by the Buddha, it is called madana.

Commenting on this verse, Kongtrul states that phenomena never stray from thetrue nature of reality (de kho na nyid, tathat›) which is primordially beyond conceptuallimitations: this is the purity of the true nature of things.When impurities are removed through cultivation of the path, the purity of the truenature is distinguished as the aggregates, elements, and so on, unified with the fivebuddhas, their five consorts, and so on. Thus, the knowledge that the aggregates and soforth have always existed as the nature of the deities is the purity of the individual deities.One’s intrinsic awareness, luminous and non-conceptual, which must be understoodthrough direct experience, has the nature of yogic cognizance. It has never been taintedby obscurations but remains pure as the innate nature which is bliss-emptiness. It is theknowledge that there is no liberation through another purity believed to exist outsideoneself: this is the purity of one’s own intrinsic awareness. These three purities apply toboth the phase of generation and that of completion (MH, ff. 32b5-33a3).27. Mahamaya (Toh. 425), vol. Nga, f. 168b6-7.

The essential principle of pristine awareness is thevery essence of all phenomena, natural luminous clarity, the nature of emptiness, fromthe beginning devoid of birth, abiding, and cessation, pure like the sky, unstained bydualistic conceptions of subject and object (MH, f. 65a6-b2).

The four aspects of perfect awakening (rdzogs pa’i byang chub rnam pa bzhi): perfectawakening in one instant (skad cig gcig gis mngon par rdzogs par byang chub pa); perfectawakening in five aspects (rnam pa lngas -); perfect awakening in twenty aspects (rnampa nyi shus -); and perfect awakening in the net of magical manifestation (sgyu ’phruldvra bas -). One instant stands for the pristine awareness vajra; five aspects, the mindvajra (thugs rdo rje); twenty aspects, the speech vajra (gsung rdo rje); and the net of magi-cal manifestation, the body vajra (sku rdo rje). The four aspects of perfect awakeningrefer to both the path and the result. They are the actual path of the total Vajradhara,and they should therefore be known as the ultimate knowledge of tantra and as theauthentic pristine awareness introduced through the initiation.As to the first, because the nature of reality is bliss alone and because, in the contextof the path, the moments of bliss that occur with the blocking of the 21,600 breaths(karmic winds) are immutable and unceasing and of an identical nature, one speaks ofthe unobscured bliss as perfect awakening in one instant.As to the second, the pure essences of the five elements (earth, etc.), reality itself, arenaturally present as the five pristine awarenesses. In the context of the path, the fiveaggregates and the five elements, through phases known as “burning the five tatagatas,”and so on, are purified in the indivisible union of natural emptiness and bliss resultingfrom the melting of vital essence. Thus, one speaks of the inner heat (gtum mo) in thebranch of subsequent application and the other branches of the sixfold yoga as perfectawakening in five aspects.As to the third, because reality is of the natures of the twenty emptinesses and, in thecontext of the path, the five sense powers, five objects, five action faculties, and their fiveactivities are conquered by inner heat and transformed and thus understood to be natu-ral emptiness, one speaks of the awakened body manifestation of inner heat and theinvincible sound that accompanies that body as perfect awakening in twenty aspects.As to the fourth, because the ultimate nature of the three existences is like a magicalmanifestation and, in the context of the path, all of the environment and inhabitants arepurified within the infinite images of emptiness, one speaks of the empty forms thatmanifest infinitely as perfect awakening in the net of magical manifestation.With respect to the result, the four aspects of perfect awakening correspond to thefour dimensions of awakening (sku bzhi). Because innate reality does not change ormove in a second moment, the innate dimension of awakening (lhan cig skyes pa’i sku,sahaj›k›ya) is perfect awakening in one instant. Because it has the nature of the fivepristine awarenesses, the dimension of reality (dharmak›ya) is perfect awakening in fiveaspects. Because it is emptiness and yet performs the functions of the sense powers,objects, action faculties, and activities, the enjoyment dimension of awakening(sambhogak›ya) is perfect awakening in twenty aspects.

The four dimensions of awakening (sku bzhi) refer to the essential, reality, enjoy-ment, and manifest dimensions. For human beings, these have the characteristics of thefourth state, deep sleep state, dream state, and waking state, respectively. For buddhas,these same states are free of obscurations (Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol. Tha, f. 122b3-4).40. The six families (rigs drug) refer to immutable bliss, the element of pristine aware-ness; consciousnesses, the element of space; compositional factors, the element of wind;feelings, the element of fire; discriminations, the element of water; and forms, the ele-ment of earth. For ordinary beings, these six are possessed of obscurations; for buddhas,they are devoid of obscurations (Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol. Tha, f. 122b4-5).41. The twelve truths (bden pa bcu gnyis) refer to the twelve links of dependent origina-tion on which conditioned existence is based: ignorance (ma rig pa, avidy›), composi-tional factors (’du byed, saôsk›ra), consciousness (rnam shes, vijñ›na), name and form(ming gzugs, n›marápa), the six objects and the sense powers (skye mched drug, ›yatana),contact (reg pa, sparŸa), sensation (tshor ba, vedan›) attachment (sred pa, tæýn›), grasping(len pa, up›d›na), becoming (srid pa, bhava), birth (skye pa, j›ti), and old age and death(rga shi, jar›maraòa). For ordinary beings, these twelve are possessed of obscurations; forbuddhas, they are devoid of obscurations (Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol. Tha, f. 122b5-6).42. The sixteen essential realities (de kho na nyid bcu drug) refer to the awakened body ofthe manifest dimension, awakened speech of the manifest dimension, awakened mindof the manifest dimension, and pristine awareness of the manifest dimension; the awak-ened body of complete enjoyment, the awakened speech of complete enjoyment, theawakened mind of complete enjoyment, and the pristine awareness of complete enjoy-ment; the awakened body of the reality dimension, the awakened speech of the realitydimension, the awakened mind of the reality dimension, and the pristine awareness ofthe reality dimension; the awakened body of the essential dimension, the awakenedspeech of the essential dimension, the awakened mind of the essential dimension, andthe pristine awareness of the essential dimension.These sixteen essential realities are distinctions within the four joys—the initial joy,the supreme joy, the special joy, and the innate joy. These, for ordinary people, arepossessed of obscurations since, with these joys, there is the loss of half of the half of thesixteen vital essences. For the buddhas, they are free of obscurations because the half ofthe half of the sixteen vital essences are withheld.To explain, one speaks of sixteen essential realities distinguished into four groups offour, each related to one of the four joys. In this case, the four joys are associated with thehead, throat, heart, and navel, respectively.Since the head is the place related to the manifest dimension and place of the vitalessence of the awakened body, one speaks of the reality of the awakened body of themanifest dimension, and so forth, corresponding to the four aspects of initial joy.Since the throat is the place related to the enjoyment dimension and place of the vitalessence of the awakened speech, one speaks of the reality of the awakened body of thecomplete enjoyment dimension, and so forth, corresponding to the four aspects of su-preme joy."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"Since the heart is the place related to the reality dimension and place of the vitalessence of the awakened mind, one speaks of the reality of the awakened body of thereality dimension, and so forth, corresponding to the four aspects of special joy.Since the navel is the place related to the innate dimension and place of the vitalessence of pristine awareness, one speaks of the reality of the awakened body of theinnate dimension, and so forth, corresponding to the four aspects of innate joy.(Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol.

The sixteen compassions refer to the light phase of the moon, themoon, and method.In this context, emptiness has three aspects: emptiness (stong pa nyid), emptiness ofthe great (chen po stong nyid), and emptiness of the ultimate (don dam pa stong pa nyid).Emptiness comprises the emptinesses of the five aggregates, which represent the first fivephases of the waning moon. The emptiness of the great consists of the emptinesses of thefive elements, which represent the second five phases (from the sixth to the tenth) of thewaning moon. The emptiness of the ultimate comprises the emptinesses of the five sensepowers which represent the next five phases (the eleventh, etc.). The day of the darkmoon, the fifteenth, is the fifteenth emptiness. Between the end of the dark moon andthe beginning of the first day of the waxing phase, there is the sixteenth, the total emp-tiness (thams cad stong pa nyid).Compassion has three aspects: focused on sentient beings (sems can la dmigs pa),focused on the teachings (chos la dmigs pa), and nonreferential (dmigs pa med pa). Thefirst represents the first five phases of the waxing of the moon. The second refers to thenext five phases (the sixth, etc.). The third refers to the next five (from the eleventh tothe fifteenth). Between the end of the full moon and the beginning of the first day of thewaning or dark phase of the moon is the sixteenth compassion (Pundarika’s StainlessLight, vol. Tha, f. 123a3-b1).44. Ten mundane initiations (’jig rten pa’i dbang bskur ba): water, diadem, silk ribbons,vajra and bell, the great deliberate behavior, name, permission, vase, secret, and pris-tine awareness through wisdom.

The eleventh, the supramundaneinitiation (’jig rten las ’das pa bcu gcig pa), known as “the fourth one which is just likethat,” has the nature of the great seal, supreme immutable pristine awareness. Throughthe words of the master, body, speech, mind, and so forth, are purified owing to thevery reality of their being unobscured in nature (Pundarika’s Stainless Light, vol. Tha,f. 123b1-4).45.

See Chapter 13, n. 31.The mutable bliss related to the desire realm is the power attained from the actionseal; the moving bliss related to the form realm is the power attained from a pristineawareness seal. These two are mundane powers. The pristine awareness of immutablebliss is the supramundane power attained from the great seal (Pundarika’s Stainless Light,vol.

The four reliances (rton pa bzhi, catu ̄pratiŸaraòa) are set forth in the Sutra on GreatPerfect Peace (Mya ngan las ’das pa chen po’i mdo) with the words of the Buddha: “Monks,the doctrine is found in four ways. It is found in the meaning, not in the words. It isfound in the teachings, not in the individual. It is found in pristine awareness, not inconsciousness. It is found in the definitive meaning, not in the provisional one.” Thesefour are extensively discussed in the Dialogue with Akshayamati Sutra (Blo gros mi zad pasbstan pa’i mdo).Reliance on the meaning rather than on the words means that one should rely on theuncommon methods to actualize the omniscience of pristine awareness rather than onthe words of common treatises or on merely the words of the eighty-four thousandaspects of the doctrine.Reliance on the teachings rather than on individuals means that one should trust theperfect view and conduct, as well as teachers of the universal way who are well-versed inthe centrist view rather than trusting persons who are important merely owing to theirsocial status or family, such as royalty, or those renowned as incarnate masters, scholars,accomplished yogins, or teachers who, despite having many students and much wealth,contradict the true teachings in their behavior.Reliance on pristine awareness rather than on consciousness means that one shouldtrust essential pristine awareness which passes beyond arising and cessation and otherconceptual constructs, trust the understanding of the two selflessnesses, and trust pris-tine awareness which correctly realizes the authentic condition of existence, the lumi-nous clarity essence of awakening. Such forms of trust are to be relied on rather thanbelieving one’s own opinion to be the ultimate one; or trusting in the conceptions thathold the self and aggregates to be real, or in the consciousnesses attached to the pleasuresof the five sensory objects.Reliance on the definitive meaning rather than on the provisional meaning meansthat one should trust the definitive meaning of the inconceivably vast and profoundtruths, the domain of experience of practitioners of superior faculties, which cannot befathomed by short-sighted sophists, proclaimers, or solitary sages. One should not trustthe provisional meaning that teaches disillusionment with cyclic existence, the libera-tion of the individualists’ way, or the points of view that assert substantial or imputedexistence, that maintain that everything is mind, or that present the emptiness of noth-ing whatsoever (IOK, vol.

Above the sun disk a blackháô transforms into a huge crossed vajra, having twelve prongs; white in the east, yellowin the south, red in the west, green in the north, and blue at the center. The vajra emitsmulticolored rays of light in all directions, creating a strong and solid enclosure of inde-structible vajras including a rim, a roofed tent above, and a ceiling. One contemplates ablazing fire with a net of arrows outside the enclosure. Vajragarbha’s Commentary on theHevajra Tantra, citing the large Hevajra Root Tantra, explains as part of the protectivecircle visualization of a ten-spoked wheel above which are positioned the ten wrathfuldeities. Accordingly, the omniscient Rangjung Dorjé says that in most cases of the phaseof generation of the highest yoga, one contemplates the protective circle of the ten wrathfulones as described in the Indestructible Tent Tantra.In terms of the definitive meaning, in the generation of the protective circle, theletter ra stands for the red vital essence, method, and the relative nature. The letter háôstands for the white vital essence, wisdom, bodhichitta, and the ultimate nature. Thecrossed vajra born from these is the pristine awareness of great bliss, the indivisibility ofmethod and wisdom. The rim is the relative truth inseparable from the ultimate truth,represented by the roof (CH, f. 61a4-b6).52. The sixth family (rigs drug pa) is that of Vajradhara (rdo rje ’chang).

Concerning their signifi-cance, see Longchenpa’s Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions, pp. 376-379.11. Five initiations that impart ability (nus pa’i dbang lnga). See Longchenpa’s DispellingDarkness in the Ten Directions, pp. 372-376.The ten initiations that bring benefit and the five initiations that impart ability aresubdivisions of the four basic initiations. The ten that bring benefit are included in thevase initiation; the supreme secret initiation is included in the secret and pristine aware-ness through wisdom initiations; the remaining four initiations that impart ability arepart of the fourth, the word initiation (Longchenpa’s Commentary on Finding Comfortand Ease in the Nature of Mind, vol. Kha, Dodrupchen Publications, f. 24b).12. The deliberate behavior of tantric conduct (spyod pa’i brtul zhugs) refers to a vastrange of activities including those that effect ripening performed during the initiation;those that effect the achievement of paths not yet achieved; those that enhance therealizations of the phase of generation and completion practiced in one’s abode, in char-nel grounds, or in power places. In particular, it refers to tantric activities performed insecret by persons who have not yet gained stability in pristine awareness, carried outduring formal sessions of meditation and between sessions. The deliberate behavior ofawareness (rig pa’i brtul zhugs) is performed openly once one has gained stability inpristine awareness and entails wearing yogic attire, associating with consorts, and soforth. The deliberate behavior of sameness (mnyam pa’i brtul zhugs) is performed through-out the tantric path and requires making no distinctions between clean and unclean,pure and impure, and so forth.13. Commentary on the Pure Scripture (mDo byang îika). Text not identified.14. Releasing (grol ba) refers to the ritual of liberating beings who are leading extremelyevil lives. According to the tantras, an evil person who throughout his life harbors in-tense hatred for others and constantly harms them, when he cannot be tamed by anyother means, should be released from the present life and his consciousness transferredto a pure buddha realm. This release serves the double purpose of saving the evil personfrom rebirth in hell and relieving others and the world of his harmful presence. Theritual to perform this release can only be performed by a yogin of the highest attainmentwho meets the following requirements with regard to motivation, action, and result:"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Regarding the motivation, the yogin must have no self-interest whatsoever and desireonly the other person’s ultimate good. For the action, the yogin must effect the releasethrough meditative absorption, hand mudras and mantras, and never resort to the use ofpoison or weapons of any kind. In addition, the yogin must be able to resurrect theindividual. For the result, the adept, using the power of meditation, must be able toproject the consciousness of the person into a pure buddha realm (Bokar Rinpoché, oralcommunication).15. Symbol (phyag rgya). A seed syllable such as háô is a symbol from which oneself asa deity manifests.The three contemplations mentioned here—the contemplation of the yoga of greatemptiness (wisdom); the contemplation of illusory compassion (method); and the con-templation of coarse and subtle symbols—refer to the contemplation of reality (de bzhinnyid kyi ting nge ’dzin); the contemplation of total vision (kun tu snang ba’i -); and thecontemplation of cause (rgyu’i -). The contemplation of reality is to remain in meditativeequanimity, free from concepts, in a state all-pervasive like space. The contemplation oftotal vision refers to the arising of impartial compassion, like a magical illusion, directedtoward all beings who lack understanding of reality. The contemplation of the cause,which depends on the preceding two, consists in the visualization of a syllable, háô forexample, which is of the essence of the pristine awareness of the state of pure presence(Kongtrul’s Sunlight, f. 12a2-4).16. Self-Arising State of Total Presence (Rig pa rang shar chen po’i rgyud). One of the maintantras of the esoteric instructions division (man ngag sde) transmitted by Garab Dorjé.17. This is the actual view to be realized at the beginning of the path, the primordialstate of pure and total presence and its expressive energy.18. The view of reality, that of great emptiness, consists in the absorption in the inte-grated state of ultimate luminous clarity, a concept-free contemplation, and in the lumi-nous clarity of deep sleep (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 230a4).19. The view of all-illuminating illusory compassion (snying rje sgyu ma kun snang gi ltaba) is the yoga of compassion like a magical illusion, a state of uninterrupted compas-sion which is the bliss that manifests from seeing all appearances of the day and dreamstate as a magical illusion (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 230a4-6).20. The view of the single seal, the union of appearance and emptiness (snang stong zung’jug phyag rgya gcig pa’i lta ba), refers to the single seal of the deity’s body, which is thegenuine union arising with the bliss of the melted vital essence brought about by thesecondary conditions of contemplation and great compassion increased by all kinds ofappearance (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 230a6-b1).21. The view of the elaborate seal, the realization of the myriad of thoughts as the mandala(rtog tshogs dkyil ’khor du rtogs pa phyag rgya spros bcas kyi lta ba), consists in the stabiliza-tion of the realization that all appearances are actually the deity, which is the state ofunion (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 230b1).22. Everything-in-one-group practice (tshom bu tshogs sgrub). Tshogs sgrub is a term bor-rowed from the Abhisamayalamkara, in which context it means “practice through accu-mulation” and refers to an aspect of the path of preparation (sbyor lam).

Edited by Dudjom Rinpoché.Kalimpong, India, 1982 (henceforth cited as NKG).25. The view as the characteristic of knowledge which is the primary cause of awakening(rgyu shes pa’i mtshan nyid lta ba) is the actual recognition of the ground continuum(gzhi rgyud), naturally present pristine awareness (rang gnas kyi ye shes), by means of thefour axioms (Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 230a2).26. Ten topics of the tantras (rgyud kyi dngos po bcu). See Chapter 20, section entitled“Ways to Teach the Tantras.”27. In the mirror-like reality which is the indivisibility of primordial purity and sponta-neous perfection manifest various images or discursive thoughts (Namkhai NorbuRinpoché, oral communication).28. In the way of the perfections, the ultimate truth is, for the most part, posited assimply emptiness; in this context, the superior ultimate truth is the indivisible union ofprimordial emptiness or purity (ka dag) and spontaneous perfection (lhun grub) of allqualities. The relative truth in this context is superior to that of the perfections as it ismanifest as the mandala of the deity.29. These axioms or reasonings (gtan tshigs), though different from those taught in thecentral way, are called axioms because they involve an object of evaluation and a meansof evaluation. However, in the fundamental nature of reality, no such distinction be-tween object evaluated and means of evaluation can be made (Namkhai Norbu Rinpoché,oral communication). The four axioms appear in Secret Essence (Toh. 832), f. 122a2; andNet of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva (Toh. 833), f. 143b5. Padmasambhava dis-cusses them briefly in his Garland of Views.30. Reading gzhal bya for gzhal byed.31. Unimpeded expressive energy (rol pa ’gag med).32. Identical cause (rgyu gcig pa) refers to the single nature of phenomena and not to asingle cause capable of producing all phenomena.33. Concerning understanding through the mode of letters (yig ’bru’i tshul gyis rtogs pa),the unborn condition of all phenomena is symbolized by the syllable a, the nature ofawakened speech. This unborn condition manifests in an illusory way with the capacityto function on a relative level; this is o, the nature of awakened body. The total presencewhich is the knowledge of such condition, illusory pristine awareness without center orlimits, is m (Padmasambhava’s Garland of Views, f. 3b5-6).Rongzom explains that understanding through the mode of letters serves the pur-pose of understanding the state of enlightenment according to tantra.

Direct cognizance (mngon sum par rtogs pa): not depending solely on the words ofthe scriptures or the instructions, a definite ascertainment from the depths of the mindby virtue of the state of one’s own pure and total presence (Garland of Views, 3b7-4a1).36. Secret Essence Tantra (Toh. 832), vol. Kha, f. 122b1.37. As for the correspondences between the five elemental properties (’byung ba lnga)and the five consorts (yum lnga), the element of earth is Lochana; water, Mamaki; fire,Pandara; wind, Tara; and space, Dhatvishvari.

The correspondences betweenthe eightfold group of consciousnesses (rnam shes tshogs brgyad) and the five pristineawarenesses (ye shes lnga) are as follows: the ground-of-all consciousness is mirror-likepristine awareness; the mental consciousness, the discerning pristine awareness; the af-flicted mind, the pristine awareness of total sameness; and the five sense consciousnesses,accomplishing pristine awareness. The pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension ofphenomena is inherent to the natures of all the other pristine awarenesses.38. Secret Essence Tantra, f. 122b1.39.

The realization thatderives from the power of acquired familiarity is the characteristic of the result (’bras bu’i -)(Garland of Views, f. 4a2-3)."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"For a succinct explanation of meditation through devotion (mos sgom) and definitiveperfection (nges rdzogs), see NSH, pp. 278 and 363.78. Dharmashri provides a brief explanation of the nature and steps of the path of libera-tion: The view as the characteristic of knowledge, the primary cause of awakening (rgyushes pa’i mtshan nyid lta ba), is the actual recognition, by means of the four axioms, of theground continuum (gzhi rgyud), naturally present pristine awareness (rang gnas kyi yeshes).Having realized the view in that way, one practices contemplation, the characteristicof application, the secondary condition (rkyen ’jug pa’i ting nge ’dzin) for awakening.Disengaging from all involvements related to the three doors, one integrates the lumi-nous clarity of concept-free contemplation with the luminous clarity of deep sleep. Re-maining absorbed in that state is the yoga of the great empty (stong pa chen po’i rnal’byor). Because in that state of luminous clarity the activity of the mind ceases, the ap-pearances of empty images arise.Consequently, the appearances of the waking state during the day and the appear-ances during the dream state at night are seen as magical illusions, like the reflections ofthe moon on water. From this the compassion of great bliss manifests unceasingly. Thisis the yoga of compassion of the magical illusion (snying rje sgyu ma’i rnal ’byor).Then, there arises the single symbol of the deity’s body, which is the genuine state ofunion correlated with the bliss of the melted vital essence brought about by the second-ary conditions of contemplation and great compassion increased by all kinds of appear-ances. As an expansion of that realization, one gains stability in the yoga of elaboration,the direct realization that all appearances are actually the deity, which is the state ofunion. Thereafter, by practicing one of the three conducts (elaborate, unelaborate, orextremely unelaborate), the proximate cause for awakening, one attains the state of animmaculate awareness-holder (VOWS, f. 230a2-b2).79. Deliberate behavior (brtul zhugs) is the conduct of a yogin who has brought undercontrol (brtul) ordinary actions conditioned by passions and has adopted (zhugs) thespecial behavior intended for overcoming dualism. See also Chapter 14, n. 40.80. The four kinds of awareness-holders refer to the awareness-holder who is ripening(rnam smin rig ’dzin), the awareness-holder with control over life span (tshe dbang -), theawareness-holder of the great seal (phyag rgya chen po -), and the spontaneously perfectawareness-holder (lhun gyis grub pa -).Longchenpa, in his Finding Comfort and Ease in the Nature of Mind, explains that thefirst awareness-holder is a practitioner of the phase of generation and phase of comple-tion who abides either on the path of accumulation or on the path of preparation. Al-though such a practitioner still has an ordinary body, she has actualized her mind as thebody of the deity. If such a person dies before having achieved the supreme state (chosmchog) of the path of preparation, discarding her body, and with her mind “ripening”(smin) into the form of the deity, she will realize the great seal in the intermediate state.The second type of awareness-holder is a practitioner who has attained the supremestate of the path of preparation, and the resulting indestructible body beyond death andbirth, and thus has control over his life span. His mind turns into the mind of the pathof seeing.NOTES TO PAGES 324 TO 327\u0002513"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"514\u0001SYSTEMS OF BUDDHIST TANTRAThe third kind of awareness-holder may be a practitioner of any of the stages ofawakening (from the first to the ninth).

Total sameness (mnyam nyid) refers here to acting in a state of absolute equanimity,without discriminating between pure and impure, and governing oneself according tothe principle of making use of all things and situations of cyclic existence, usually con-sidered to be avoided, while not adhering to any specific form of conduct. In this way,there is nothing that does not become merit. The enjoyment of everything is merit, andbeing detached, wisdom (Namkhai Norbu Rinpoché, oral communication).17.

Mind (sems) here refers to original pure mind (byang chub sems, bodhicitta), naturallypresent pristine awareness. See below, n. 30.27. The total sphere (thig le), free from corners, refers to reality free from all extremescreated by conceptual fabrications.28. The Total Space of Vajrasattva. This tantra appears in its entirety as the thirtiethchapter of the Majestic Creative Energy. These lines (Toh. 828, vol. Ka, f. 36a5-6) arepart of the third of fifty-five quatrains.29. See Chapter 17, n. 26.30. The division on mind (sems sde). Mind (sems) is an abbreviation for original puremind (byang chub sems, bodhicitta) which the Majestic Creative Energy of the UniverseTantra defines as pure and totally perfected presence, one’s own true nature, primor-dial awakening. The emphasis of this division is the master’s introduction to the prac-titioner of his or her own spontaneously perfect state beyond all verbal and mentallimitations.31. The essence of the mind division (sems sde) is to sustain the state beyond acceptanceor rejection based on the realization that all of the appearances of the environment andits inhabitants are the ineffable reality dimension of awakening, the naturally presentpristine awareness which is the very nature of the mind.The essence of the vast space division (klong sde) is to sustain the state of the non-objectifiable authentic condition which is beyond effort, based on the realization thatnaturally present pristine awareness and all phenomena that manifest from it have noplace of abiding other than the vast space of Ever-Perfect, the authentic condition whichis primordial liberation and natural purity.The esoteric instructions division (man ngag sde) is subdivided into outer (phyi),inner (nang), secret (gsang), and most secret (yang gsang) cycles. The essence of theesoteric instructions division from the perspective of the most secret and unsurpassablecycle is to realize mind’s absence of base or root as primordial purity, and with thatunderstanding, practice total relaxation (khregs chod), the great natural condition inwhich mind and appearances are left in the state of primordial liberation.Then, by opening the buddhas’ treasury of spontaneously perfect mandalas of thebody, one meditates on the path of the four lamps, the direct leap (thod rgal), which islooking at the face of the spontaneously perfect mandala, the luminous clarity of natu-rally present pristine awareness. By means of this, when phenomena exhaust themselvesin the state of reality, all aggregates and faculties are naturally purified. By hammeringthe nails of the three attainments, one actualizes the naturally present lamp of wisdom(Dharmashri’s VOWS, f. 231b1-6).32. Indisputable logic (gtan tshigs) here stands for realizations that replace the mentallyconstructed axioms of the lower systems.33. Seven distinctions in the view in the division on mind: the first, the view that theresult is the source of mind (’bras bu sems kyi byung sar ’dod pa’i sems phyogs); the second,the view of the transcendence of deviations and obscurations (gol sgrib la bzla ba’i -); thethird, the view concerning the collapse of the foundation of logical reasoning (gtan tshigskhongs rdib pa’i -); the fourth, the view that the true nature of reality neither falls to one"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"side nor is limited (rgya chad phyogs lhung med par ’dod pa’i -); the fifth, the view that thetrue nature transcends partial and limited philosophical positions (phyogs ’dzin grub mtha’las ’das pa’i -); the sixth, the view that the true nature is beyond the conceptual mind andtranscends limited positions (blo bral phyogs ’dzin las ’das pa’i -); and the seventh, theview that everything is part of mind (sems kyi phyogs yin du smra ba’i -).34. The assertion that all appearances are the mind’s expressive energy (sems kyi rol pa) isnot equivalent to the idealist’s assertion that everything arises from the mind. Here, it isnot asserted that things arise from mind but rather that they are simply mind’s expres-sive energy. The difference is that the expressive energy manifests like reflections in amirror. Wherever a mirror is placed, there will always be some reflections in it. Thereflections are, so to say, the display, or expression, of the mirror, but are not created bythe mirror itself (Namkhai Norbu Rinpoché, oral communication).35. An important text for understanding the mind division of atiyoga is the Light of theEyes for Meditation (bSam gtan mig sgron / sGom gyi gnad gsal bar phye ba bsam gtan migsgron) by Nupchen Sang-gye Yeshe (gNubs chen sangs rgyas ye shes), published by bKrashis sgang pa (Leh, 1974), which includes presentations of the profound early views ofthe mind division held by Garab Dorjé, Shri Simha, Manjushrimitra, Indrabhuti (Kingof Oddiyana), Vimalamitra, and other masters.36. Black vast space propounded as the absence of cause (klong nag po rgyu med du smraba); multicolored vast space propounded as diversity (klong khra bo sna tshogs su smraba); white vast space propounded as mind (klong dkar po sems su smra ba); and infinitespace in which cause and result are transcended (klong rab ’byams rgyu ’bras la zlo ba).37. For the names of the divisions, see NSH, p. 327.38. Four vast spaces (klong bzhi): expressive energy (rol pa), ornament (rgyan), truenature (chos nyid), and transcendence of action (bya bral). This last erroneously appearsin IOK as bya rtsol. For a concise explanation of these, see NSH, p. 328.39. Three distinctions within the general view of the esoteric instructions division: theview of the scattered teachings (kha ’thor); of the oral tradition (kha gtam); and of thetextual tradition of its own tantras (rgyud rang gzhung).40. For the names of these divisions, see NSH, p. 331.41. Four visionary appearances (snang ba bzhi): the visionary appearance of the directperception of reality (chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba); the visionary appearance ofincreasing contemplative experience (nyams gon ’phel gyi snang ba); the visionary ap-pearance of reaching perfected awareness (rig pa tshad phebs kyi snang ba); and thevisionary appearance in which phenomena cease to be apprehended in reality (chosnyid zad pa’i snang ba). See Dudjom Rinpoché’s succinct explanation of these in NSH,p. 339.42. For a concise explanation of total relaxation (khregs chod) and direct leap (thod rgal),see NSH, pp. 335-345.43.
