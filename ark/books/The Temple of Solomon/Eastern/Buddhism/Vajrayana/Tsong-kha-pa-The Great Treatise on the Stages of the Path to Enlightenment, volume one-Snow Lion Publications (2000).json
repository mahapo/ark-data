The first volume sets forth all of the preliminary practices for developing the spirit of enlight-enment (bodhicitta, byang chub kyi sems). The subsequent volumes focus on the motivation and practice of the bodhisattva, with the final volume offering a detailed presentation of meditative seren-ity (samatha, zhi gnas) and insight (vipasyana, lhag mthong). This translation has been done under the auspices of the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center (TBLC), which was founded in 1958 by the late Geshe Ngawang Wangyal in Washington, New Jersey. Geshe-Ia was the trailblazer in the teaching of Tibetan Buddhism in this country and gave his students a broad spectrum of teach-ings from all the Tibetan traditions, including various short presen-tations of the stages of the path (lam rim) written by Tsong-kha-pa, some of which were published before his death in 1983. The lam rim presentation of the teachings as a graduated path to enlighten-ment has also become one of the core topics of study at the TBLC, as it has for many other centers of Tibetan Buddhism around the world. For the busy members of our modem society the stages of the path literature gives a concise and easily grasped picture of the Buddhist path. All the books on the stages of the path according to the Ge-Iug tradition published until now are derived from the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, and carry an inher-ent assumption that the reader can refer to this primary source. However, to date there has been no complete English translation of this text."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"10 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path In 1991 Loling Geshe Yeshe Tapkay and Donald Lopez, then vis-iting teachers at the TBLC, proposed that the TBLC organize a group of translators to make a complete translation of the Great Treatise. I enthusiastically embraced their idea. As Geshe Wangyal's student I had always wanted to undertake a translation of one of Tsong-kha-pa's major works, because Geshe-Ia had inspired me with his reverence for Tsong-kha-pa. He once told me that he was especially interested in Tsong-kha-pa's writings because Tsong-kha-pa had received many personal instructions from Manjusri in visionary experiences. I was further impressed by this when I read in Losang Yeshe's Quick Path (Lam rim myur lam) that Manjusri had made sure that Tsong-kha-pa wrote the Great Treatise with the special feature of blending the three types of persons (skyes bu gsum )-the persons of small, medium, or great capacities-with the three principal as-pects of the path (lam gyi gtso bo rnam gsum )-the determination to be free (nges byung), the spirit of enlightenment (byang chub kyi sems), and correct view (yang dag pa'i Ita ba). Furthermore, as the TBLC had many qualified translators associated with it, this plan seemed feasible. The text was divided amongst fourteen translators, and thus was born the Lamrim Chenmo Translation Committee. In the summer of 1992 several meetings were held at the TBLC to agree on a list of technical terminology. By looking at the ensuing intro-ductory material, the reader will see that reaching agreement on Buddhist technical terms is itself a monumental task. For the ease of the reader the translators have arranged the text for Volume One in twenty-four chapters adapted from the Tibetan outline. The entire outline of this first section of the text is appended at the end of the volume. The translators have approached the task of translation with the general reader in mind. Thus, although Tsong-kha-pa almost invari-ably uses an abbreviation when citing a text, here a rough English equivalent of a fuller name of the text is provided. At the first oc-currence of a text's citation, the fuller title is provided in its origi-nallanguage. The full name of the text as it is found in The Tibetan Trip#aka, Peking Edition edited by D.T. Suzuki (1955-61) is given in the note at the first citation of each work. In those cases in which Tsong-kha-pa does not provide the author's name when quoting a text, the name of its author-as identified by traditional Tibetan authorities, even when modern scholarship has not determined the author or has identified another author-is added in the transla-tion. The translators have given the location of the citation in Suzuki"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Editor's Preface 11 where possible in an effort to provide a reference for scholars who wish to pursue more detailed research into the Tibetan text. Addi-tional bibliographic information about these texts is provided in the bibliography. The translators have not attempted an exhaustive bibliography, but supply information about the original language editions and translations they have generally used. Readers seeking more de-tailed information about translations and other works in English are directed to Pfandt (1983), de Jong (1987), Nakamura (1989) and Hirakawa (1990). The translators have used an approximate English phonetic equivalent for the names of Tibetan authors, orders, and places. The correct Tibetan spelling in accordance with Wylie (1959) is given in parentheses at the first occurrence. The translators have also added a short glossary of Tibetan technical terms at the end. The members of the Lamrim Chenmo Translation Committee who worked on this volume are Elizabeth S. Napper, Joshua W. C. Cutler, John Newman, Joe B. Wilson, and Karen Lang. They used the edition published by the Tso Ngon (Qinghai) People's Press in 1985 which was based on the Ja-kyung (Bya khyung) block prints. The Tibetan page numbers of this edition are included throughout the translation in brackets and bold typeface for ease of reference. The translators used the Ganden Bar Nying edition as a reference since it is regarded as the oldest set of wood blocks of the text. No exact date for the carving of the wood blocks appears in the text, but another important text in the same set of wood blocks, the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Mantra Path (sNgags rim chen mo), was carved in 1426. His Holiness the Dalai Lama graciously lent Eliza-beth Napper the Ganden Bar Nying manuscript from his private library. She then had it microfilmed under the auspices of the Li-brary of Tibetan Works and Archives. The translators compared the Tso Ngon and Ganden editions and found no significant variants. The translators also referred to the commentary Four Interwoven Annotations (Lam rim mchan bzhi sbrags rna) and used it consistently to interpret citations. The editors have read through the text and discussed the interpretation of difficult passages with the eminent contemporary Tibetan Buddhist scholars Denma Locho Rimbochay and Loling Geshe Yeshe Tapkay.

It presents a stunning vision of the timeless origin and infinite permutations of all life forms, locating the pre-cious jewel of an individual human embodiment at a critical mo-ment of personal evolution. It provides this revelation in such a way that individual readers can be moved to achieve a fundamental paradigm shift in their vision of their lives: from having been a self-centered, this-life-oriented personal agent struggling with the cur-rents and obstacles around them, anxiously seeking some security and happiness before hopefully finding peaceful obliteration in death; to becoming a magnificent awakening being soaring out of an infinite past experience in marvelous evolutionary flight toward an unimaginably beautiful destiny of wisdom, love, and bliss-Buddhahood, or simply the supreme evolutionary glory attainable by any conscious being. The Great Treatise did not originate this vision, of course. It is the very vision propounded by Shakyamuni Buddha and his enlight-ened followers, in all the Asian civilizations for almost two millen-nia, through a vast literature with many branches in many lan-guages, that reveals humans to themselves as participant in this magnificent and meaningful evolutionary process. The Great Treatise gathers the threads of story, image, and teach-ing from this luminous literature and weaves them into a concen-trated pattern, a fabric so rich and comprehensive and versatile it can be fashioned into useful and beautiful raiment adaptable to any per-son who seeks to wear it. It is sometimes said that Jey Tsong-kha-pa"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"14 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path took the Dharma teachings of the Buddha at a time when they were due to fade into neglect and essential disuse as beings everywhere quarreled and struggled over the formalities and properties asso-ciated with enlightenment, penetrated their quintessential truths, and revitalized their practice in so powerful a manner they would energize millions of open-minded people over the subsequent five hundred years. Once readers have achieved the axial shift of perception system-atically revealed in this symphonic work, the Great Treatise gives them detailed and specific practical methods to implement their vision in the transformative practices needed to aid them in their flight. These practices are skillfully arranged to awaken the worldly person obsessed with success in this life and lead anyone of the three types of spiritual persons from evolutionary stage to evolu-tionary stage. The stages run from reliance on the spiritual men-tor, through the themes that free the spirit in transcendent renun-ciation-the preciousness of human embodiment endowed with liberty and opportunity, immediacy of death, evolutionary cau-sality, and pervasiveness of suffering of unenlightened living; into the themes that open the heart-compassion, love, and the altru-istic spirit of enlightenment; and finally into the profound and de-finitively liberative intricacies of the transcendent wisdom of sub-jective and objective selflessness. Students and practitioners can use these themes and methods over and over, taking them ever more deeply into their hearts, and their lives will slowly but surely improve. It is crucial to remember that the Great Treatise is not a work of gradualism, a mere set of preliminary practices aiming to prepare the reader for some higher esoteric teaching somehow waiting there out beyond its teachings of the path. It is an exoteric-open-teach-ing, to be sure, and its path is even referred to by its author as the \"shared\" (thun mong) path, the path shared by both exoteric and esoteric teachings. It is the fullest, highest teaching, the concentrated quintessence of the entirety of the Buddhist path from all the ocean of its literature, concentrated by its integration with the supreme esoteric teachings of the Tantras every single step of its way. For example, the beginning stage, the reliance on the spiritual mentor, is indeed a foundational stage in every Buddhist teaching. But the Great Treatise does not teach it with preliminary methodology. The visualization of the refuge field, the heavenly host of the Mentor and all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, deities, angels, and spiritual"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Foreword 15 ancestors-this vision is drawn from the most esoteric tantric meth-odologies and made freely available in an unerringly useful way without exposing the uninitiated practitioner to the danger of for-mal tantric performance. The way transcendence is taught, the way compassion and the spirit of enlightenment are taught, and even the way wisdom is taught as the inexorable indivisibility of void-ness and relativity-all this makes the power of Tantra accessible in a generous, transformative, and dynamic, but safe and sound, perhaps we could say fail-safe, way. This is the genius of the Great Treatise. Some practitioners are so overwhelmed when they experience the shift of vision from this-worldly self-centeredness to cosmically altruistic evolutionary expansiveness, they feel a powerful need to purify their bodies by hundreds of thousands of prostrations, pil-grimages, asceticisms, and complex rituals, their speech by millions of mantra repetitions, and their minds by hundreds of thousands of mentor-worship bonding rituals. These are powerful gateway practices. Jey Tsong-kha-pa himself, after deeply studying all the earlier versions of the stages of the path teachings from all tradi-tions, performed 3,500,000 prostrations, offered 10,000,000 mandala-universe give-aways, recited countless Vajrasattva purification mantras, performed countless mentor rituals, and did fourteen other kinds of practices. And finally he achieved his aim. There-upon, he wrote the Great Treatise to help all other kinds of persons reach their aims, in whichever way they need to go, but in the easi-est manner possible for them, always with the optimal efficiency of perfect adaptation to their specific evolutionary situation. So many people achieved this new vision in the centuries following, the whole of Tibetan culture completed its transformation into a vehicle of the enlightenment-orientation for all its people, and its unique atmosphere spilled over from the Himalayan plateau onto the steppes of Inner Asia. During the nearly 600 years since its writing, the beneficiaries of the Great Treatise have mainly been Tibetans and Mongolians, still numbering in the millions. In this century there have been tenta-tive translations into Russian and into Chinese, neither of which has yet spread widely in those cultures. Parts of, and commentar-ies on, the work have been translated into English in recent decades. It is thus a historic occasion that the students of the late Vener-able Geshe Wangyal have gathered together a team of scholars to create a complete English translation of this masterpiece. They"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"16 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path pooled their efforts, analyzed the texts with intellectual rigor, searched their hearts with great sincerity, experimented for the best terminologies, and produced this labor of love.

It is my honor and delight in this foreword to congratulate the translators and rejoice in their achievement, a product of their own effort to repay the great kindness of our true spiritual friend, our KalyillJamitra, the Holy Mentor Geshe Wangyal, who came out here to our wild and woolly savage land, haunted by generations of conquest and enslavement and ongoing violence without and within, and brought us the undimmed lamp of the Enlightenment Path, alive in him as cheerful hope, courageous kindness, incisive wisdom, absolutely adamantine practical concern, and an all-embracing miraculous determination that lives on.

This he did at the mon-astery of Rva-sgreng, a center for the old bKa' -gdams-pa tradition which goes back to the Indian master Atisha (982-1054) and his great Tibetan pupil, the lay disciple 'Brom-ston-pa, and to their numer-ous Tibetan followers in the eleventh-twelfth centuries such as the graded path (lam rim) masters dGon-pa-ba dBang-phyug-rgyal-mtshan and Po-to-ba Rin-chen-gsal. The Great Treatise is made up of sections which are further di-vided into subsections and individual rubrics. First comes a metri-cal prologue paying homage to the great masters of the lam rim spiritual tradition beginning with the Buddha and passing through Maitreya and Mafljugho~a-the Bodhisattva patrons of the twin great departments of deep philosophical theory (zab mo'i ita ba, darsana) and of extensive spiritual practice (rgya chen spyod pa, carya)-together with the masters Arya Nagarjuna and Arya"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"18 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Asanga, who by their teaching opened up the way for this pair of philosophical-spiritual disciplines [1-2].3 The main body of the Great Treatise opens with a preamble set-ting out the instruction to be treated in it (gdams pa'i sngon 'gro) [3-32]. The following section expounds the progressive method by which the student is to be guided through this instruction, consist-ing in attending on the spiritual friend (dge bshes, kalya1}amitra) and in the practicer-disciple's mind-training and purification [33-97].4 The next section is concerned with the graded path suitable for the last, or lowest, category of persons (skyes bu chung ngu/ tha ma), namely those who delight in the pleasures of the round of existences ('khor ba, sa1!1sara) and strive merely for a fortunate future existence in a heavenly world still belonging to the world of sa:rp.sara [98-205]. The following section deals with the middling category of persons (skyes bu 'bring), those who develop a distaste for existences and seek lib-eration for their own sake [206-280]. These two paths are neverthe-less described as being nonspecific or \"common\" (thun mong ba), for to a very large degree they remain applicable to all Buddhist exercitants. The following sections of the Great Treatise are all de-voted in principle to the highest category of persons (skyes bu chen po), that is, to those who are characterized by compassion (snying rje, karu1}a) and therefore strive to achieve awakening (byang chub, bodhi) in order to bring an end to the pain of all sentient beings. They accordingly train themselves in generating the mind of awakening (byang chub kyi sems, bodhicitta) in its two forms of aspirational vow (smon pa'i sems, pra1}idhana-citta) and engagement ('jug pa'i sems, prasthana-citta) [281-468]. This high form of training relates in particular to the first four perfections (paramita) of the bodhisattva, namely generosity (sbyin pa, dana; \"liberality\"), ethical discipline (tshul khrims, ilIa), patient receptivity (bzod pa, k~anti), and energy (brtson 'grus, virya). The last two in this classic set of six perfections, meditation (bsam gtan, dhyana) and discriminative understanding (shes rab, prajna), have then been treated in two very long and detailed sections of the Great Treatise. In them is carefully examined the true nature of fixation-meditation ('jog sgom) as Tsong-kha-pa understands it-and which he shows to be far removed from any simple quietism or ataraxia and from cataleptic fixation or trance (har sgom, had de 'jogpa)-and of analytical meditative realization (dpyad sgom) made up of prajna or analytical investigation (so sor rtog pa = pratyave~a)Â­as opposed to unbridled intellection and mental activity-together"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 19 with the two corresponding factors of tranquillity (zhi gnas, samatha) and insight (lhag mthong, vipasyana) and their very close interrela-tion. These twin sections on tranquillity and insight are thus the most detailed, the most difficult and doubtless also the most ground-breaking in the Great Treatise. It is here above all that the very remarkable contribution made by Tsong-kha-pa to Buddhist thought, and to philosophy and spirituality in general, is revealed. The first of these two sections is accordingly nothing less than a searching and penetrating treatise on the subject of tranquillity (zhi gnas, samatha) involving both bodily and mental calm (shin sbyangs, prasrabdhi)-the contrary of turbulence (gnas ngan len, dau~thulya)Â­that examines samatha in the greatest detail with a view to defining its relation to insight (lhag mthong, vipasyana) and to establishing just how these two factors alternate at certain stages of practice and then mutually reinforce each other [468-563}. Major topics treated in this context are attention or mindfulness (dran pa, smrti), awareness (shes bzhin, samprajanya), mentation (yid la byed pa, manasikara), com-posure or equanimity (btang snyoms, upek~a), natural quietude (rna I du 'dug pa, prasathavahita), aptitude for spiritual and philosophical operation (las su rung ba, karma1Jyattl), and non-conceptualization ({cir yang] mi rtog pa, nirvikalpa). Special attention is given to the practicer's need to avoid torpor and drowsiness (rmug pa and gnyid, styanamiddha) and laxness (bying ba, laya; \"accidie\") marked by slackness (glod pa, lhod drags pa) as well as agitation (rgod pa, auddhatya) marked by excessive tension (sgrim pa, grims drags pa) or effort (rtsol ba). The appropriate procedure for cultivating tran-quillity has here been illustrated by the classical comparison with the training of an elephant [506-507}. The nine forms of stabilization of mind (sems gnas pa, cittasthiti) associated with tranquillity are also discussed at length. This section reflects Tsong-kha-pa's under-standing of the teaching of Asanga, and it therefore quotes exten-sively from this master's Abhidharma-samuccaya and, in particular, from his Sravaka-bhumi. Other major sources often cited in this sec-tion are the Sarrzdhi-nirmocana-sutra and Ratnakarasanti's Prajiia-paramitopadesa. The second of this pair of sections is an even longer, and virtu-ally independent, study on insight (lhag mthong, vipasyana), which is often quoted, and sometimes commented upon separately, un-der the title of Great [Treatise on] Insight (lHag mthong chen mo) [564-809). Toward its beginning we find a discussion of the question as to how to differentiate between sutra-texts that are considered, in"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"20 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path the doctrinal frame of the Madhyamaka, to be of final, definitive meaning (nges pa'i don, nUiirtha) and those that are on the contrary regarded, in the same frame, as being of provisional meaning and as therefore requiring to be further interpreted, or \"elicited,\" in a sense other than the obvious surface one (drang ba'i don, neyiirtha). Also briefly discussed in this context is the distinction in the herme-neutics of the Madhyamaka between a nitiirtha text and one that is of literal, word-for-word meaning (sgra ji bzhin pa, yathii-ruta) and between a neyiirtha text and one that is non-literal (sgra ji bzhin ma yin pa). Buddhist hermeneutics was several years afterwards to be the subject of a major independent work by Tsong-kha-pa com-pleted in his fifty-second year (1408), the Drang nges legs bshad snying po. A careful consideration of the nature of the two \"principles\" of ultimate reality (don dam pa'i bden pa, paramiirthasatya) and the sur-face-level (kun rdzob bden pa, sa1J1vrtisatya), or transactional/prag-matic usage (tha snyad [bden paJ, vyavahiira[satyaJ), is pertinent here. Essentially, this section of the Great Treatise is concerned with the object of vipasyanii, namely the theory of emptiness (stong pa nyid, sunyatii) in its twin aspects of absence of self-nature (rang bzhin med pa) or self-existence (ngo bo nyid med pa, ni~sva-bhiivatii)-i.e. the \"aseitas\" of any entity (dngos po, bhiiva) posited as hypostatically es-tablished (bden par grub pa)-and origination in dependence (rten cing 'brei bar 'byung ba, pratityasamutpiida)5 as expounded by Nagarjuna and his great successors in the Madhyamaka school. These are in par-ticular Buddhapalita (c. 500 C.E.), Bhavya (Bha[va]viveka, sixth cen-tury) and Candrakirti (seventh century). Tsong-kha-pa's discussion involves among other things a consideration of the coordinate pair made up of presentation-appearance and the empty (snang stong), it being concluded that it is in fact by presentation-appearance in dependent origination that the philosophical extreme of eternal existence (yod mtha', astitii) is eliminated while the philosophical extreme of nihilistic nonexistence (med mtha', niistitii) is eliminated by emptiness. This procedure allows the Madhyamika to keep to the philosophical middle path (dbu ma'i lam, madhyamii pratipat), and it answers to the theory that the transactional/pragmatic (vyavahiira) is established on its own level through right knowledge or pramiiI'Ja (tha snyad tshad [masJ grub [pal). (Compare the idea in Western thought of saving the phenomenal: sozein tel phain6mena, salvare phaenomena, \"to save [phenomenal] appearances.\") This section furthermore includes a discussion of the negandum for the path (lam gyi dgag byal lam goms pa'i dgag bya, i.e. the bden 'dzin gyi ma rig"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 21 pa or subjective misknowledge that engages in hypostatization or reification) and the negandum for reasoning (rigs pa'i dgag bya, i.e. the bden grub or objective hypostatic establishment [651 ff.J).1t is also demonstrated how the negandum must be delimited neither too widely (dgag bya ngo 'dzin [ha eang] khyab ehes pa) nor too narrowly (khyab ehung bal ehungs pa).6 This discussion also involves an ex-amination of the methods of the two main branches of the Madhyamaka, namely Bhavya's \"Svatantrika\" (the Rang-rgyud-pa or \"Autonomist\" branch which on its own account admits an au-tonomous probative inference, svatantranumana, and a formal \"syl-logism,\" svatantraprayoga) and Buddhapalita's and Candrakirti's \"Prasangika\" (the Thal-'gyur-ba or \"Apagogist\" branch which in-stead relies on apagogical reasoning that serves to point up an oc-currence or \"eventuation,\" prasanga, which is undesired by the opponent himself). There is also a detailed and fundamental dis-cussion of the question whether the Prasangika-Madhyamika (as distinct from the Svatantrika) can legitimately entertain, within the frame of his philosophy, any thesis (dam bea', pratijna), assertion (khas len pa, abhyupagama) or position (rang gi phyogs, svapak$a or rang lugs, svamata) of his own, Tsong-kha-pa concluding that he in fact can and does. This analysis comprises some very important observa-tions on the place in Madhyamaka thought of right knowledge (tshad ma, prama1Ja, definable in terms of a cognition that is reliable, veridical and indefeasible), and it leads to the conclusion that even if such a prama1Ja is not established in ultimate reality it still has a fundamental role to play on the level of transactional/pragmatic usage (tha snyad, vyavahara).7 Next comes an examination of how Madhyarnaka theory (Ita ba, darsana) is generated in the philosopher-practicer's mental continuum (rgyud, sa1!1tana), including an expo-sition of the comprehension (rtogs pa, adhigama), or ascertainment (nges pa, niseaya), of the non-substantiality (bdag med pa, nairatmya) of the individual (gang zag, pudgala) and of all factors of existence (ehos, dharma) [719-769]. This treatment of emptiness, or non-substan-tiality, is followed by a very detailed exposition on the forms of in-sight (vipasyana) and of how it is realized [769-808]. Here Tsong-kha-pa has once again discussed the nature of fixation-meditation ('jog sgom) and analytical meditation (dpyad sgom) and the relation be-tween these two forms of realization. This final major section of the Great Treatise closes with a very brief reference to the Vajrayana [808-809]. It is to be noticed that from time to time throughout his treatise Tsong-kha-pa has alluded to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"22 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path the question of how the \"exoteric\" Sutranaya or Paramitayana of the scholastic (mtshan nyid pa) and the philosopher-exercitant, to which the Lam rim chen mo is essentially devoted, links up with the \"esoteric\" Mantrayana or Vajrayana of the mantrin (sngags pa) and yogin (rnal'byor pa).8 The Great Treatise concludes with a short metrical epilogue [810-812] and a colophon [812-813]. Tsong-kha-pa presents his Great Treatise as inspired (especially in its earlier sections) by the Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment (Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma or Bodhi-patha-pradlpa), composed by the re-nowned Bengali master Atisha Dipaqli<arasrijflana (982-1054), who migrated from India to Tibet where he became the source of the Tibetan bKa'-gdams-pa tradition. Atisha's relatively brief work takes as its point of departure the above-mentioned division of three ascending spiritual categories of person (skyes bu gsum). As a composition that presents a synthesis of very many of the spiritual and philosophical traditions of Buddhism constituting the Path of Awakening, Tsong-kha-pa's Great Treatise cites, often at very considerable length, a large number of sources drawn from Bud-dhist scriptural (satra) and, above all, exegetical (sastra) literature. The first place is occupied by numerous Mahayanist (i.e. Para-mitayana and, accessorily, Vajrayana) sources. But works belong-ing to the path of the sravaka, and the Vinaya, are also frequently quoted or referred to; these include a number of scriptural works, Vasubandhu's Abhidharma-kosa along with its autocommentary 'Jhich pertain to the Vaibha~ika and Sautrantika schools, and the Sravaka-bhumi (which is one of the main sources for Tsong-kha-pa's treatment of tranquillity). It is to be observed that references to the latter Sravakayanist works are found not only in the sections con-cerned with the two lower categories of person but also in those devoted to the highest category constituted by the Bodhisattva and aspirant Mahayanist. This feature is of course perfectly regular and normal in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition which is certainly Mahayanist, but not in the exclusive sense sometimes supposed (especially in the West) since it embraces the entirety of the Word of the Buddha inclusive of the Sravakayana as well as of the Mahayana, and because it encompasses not only the two disciplines (saf!1vara) of the Bodhisattva and the Mantrin (or Vajrayanist) but"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 23 also the pratimok~a discipline of the ordained monk or bhik~u fol-lowing the Vinaya. Tsong-kha-pa as well as most of his teachers and his disciples were indeed monks following the Vinaya of the MoJasarvastivadin order, which was the Vinaya school (or Nikaya) adopted in Tibet. The Great Treatise is no mere commentary on these sources but, rather, an independent summa and synthesis of Buddhist ethical, religious, and philosophical thought and practice. In its language, style, and presentation it is no doubt slightly less scholastic than several of Tsong-kha-pa's other major works; but it is nonetheless a theoretically grounded treatise on soteriology and gnoseology that always requires the reader's very close, and informed, attention. Tsong-kha-pa's tradition indeed never claimed that the Buddhist path could be an easy one amenable to any kind of \"quick fix\"; and if certain lam rim texts have sometimes been described by their authors as a bde lam or myur lam, the path set out in them is describ-able as \"easy\" or \"convenient\" and as \"rapid\" only relatively to other, more detailed and technical, expositions. Moreover, although not properly speaking a polemical work, the Great Treatise does not avoid thorny, and sometimes controversial, issues. But only seldom does it explicitly name the scholars whose views it opposes after a critical examination. In particular, in his sections on tranquillity and insight-but also in earlier sections of this work-Tsong-kha-pa has often referred, either explicitly or tac-itly, to certain vexed issues of theory and practice that had arisen in Tibet as early as the end of the eighth century in connection with the \"Great Debate of bSam yas\"; and on a number of occasions he has mentioned \"the view, or method, of the Ho-shang\" (hva shang gi Ita ba/ lugs). This is a reference to the opinion that all effort, all mental activity and discursive intellection and all conceptualization-indeed anything that is not entirely natural and spontaneous-is nothing but an obstacle to spiritual understanding, a view ascribed-no doubt somewhat emblematically and with perhaps only limited justice-to the Chinese Ho-shang Mo-ho-yen (Mahayana).9 By Tsong-kha-pa this view is treated as a case where the negandum (rigs pa'i dgag bya) in philosophical analysis has been delimited by its propounders in a way that is too wide, thus leading in effect to a form of philosophical (and spiritual) negativism or nihilism. Another target of criticism is the doctrine of the\" empty of the het-erogeneous\" (gzhan stong) which was advocated by the Tibetan Jo-nang-pa school, the masters of which Tsong-kha-pa does not here mention by name. This doctrine-which is opposed to that of the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"24 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path \"empty of self-existence\" (rang stong, svabhavasunya) linked with Candrakirti and his Tibetan followers amongst whom Tsong-kha-pa is himself included-is connected with a philosophical view where (as in the case just mentioned) the negandum (dgag bya) has been delimited too widely by being made to include the whole of the sa1J1vrti level of pragmatic usage, so that it too might be regarded as negativist or nihilist. But, first and foremost, the gzhan stong doctrine is regarded as a kind of substantialism-a dngos par smra ba-because it is understood to posit an absolute that is empty of all that is heterogeneous or different from itself (gzhan stong) with-out, however, being itself empty of self-existence (rang stong), the negandum being then delimited too narrowly. In addition, the \"Svatantrika\" doctrine of the Indian master Bhavya and his follow-ers in India and above all in Tibet is the object of criticism in so far as it is held by Tsong-kha-pa to postulate entities which, although ultimately empty of self-existence, are nevertheless describable as being established by self-characteristic (rang gi mtshan nyid kyis grub pa) on the surface level. And, following Candrakirti, Tsong-kha-pa rejects the addition of the specification \"in the ultimate sense\" (don dam par, paramarthatas) before the four great propositions with which Nagarjuna has begun his Madhyamaka-kiirikiis, and which proclaim the non-production of a self-existent entity (dngos po, bhava) from (i) itself, (ii) another such entity, (iii) both, and (iv) neither (Le. from no cause at all). This is because the notion of origination by self-existence on the surface level of sa1J1vrti alone is considered to be incoherent [668 f.]. In various contexts in the Great Treatise, other theories too have been examined and criticized in more or less de-tail. For example, as already noted above, a topic of controversy examined at some length is the question whether-in addition to the Svatantrika (Rang-rgyud-pa)-the advocate of the purely deconstructive method of apagogical reduction (prasariga)-the so-called Prasangika (Thal-'gyur-ba)-may entertain a philosophical position (pak~a) of his own, and whether he may formulate a thesis (pratijiia) and a corresponding assertion (abhyupagama), while still remaining faithful to his school's prasariga-method. Unlike some other authorities who have considered this problem, Tsong-kha-pa's conclusion is that the \"Prasangika\" does indeed maintain such a philosophical position and thesis; to show this he has examined critically even the views of certain earlier Madhyamika masters regarded as \"Prasangikas\" who were active in Tibet such as the Kashmirian master Jayananda, Khu Mdo-sde-'bar and rMa-bya.lO"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 25 Even though the Great Treatise has in effect inaugurated a distinct genre in Tibetan religio-philosophical writing, Tsong-kha-pa's work on the lam rim was certainly not without antecedents and parallels in Sanskrit and Tibetan texts. Total innovation was indeed not his aim. On the Indian side, beside the above-mentioned Bodhi-patha-pradipa by Atisha dating from the eleventh century, which was itself based in part on instruction its author received from Dharmakirti of Su~al1).advipa (gSer-gling-pa), mention is to be made in particular of Santi de va's SiJc?a-samuccaya (seventh-eighth century), a work de-scribed as a Bodhisattva-vinaya comprising some nineteen topics in Buddhist practice and thought and constituting an anthology of rel-evant canonical texts, and of the same author's Bodhi(sattva)-caryavatara, which is structured round an exposition of the six per-fections (paramita) and which thus parallels Tsong-kha-pa's treatment of the same perfections in the sections of his Great Treatise devoted to the highest category of person (skyes bu chen po) and the path of the bodhisattva. Of special relevance also are Kamalasila's three Bhavana-kramas (eighth century) and Ratnakarasanti's PrajflaparamitopadeÂ§a (eleventh century), which are often quoted in the Great Treatise. In support of his exposition Tsong-kha-pa has made a point of citing, and often of quoting at length, a very large body of Indian sutra and sastra sources. Among the most renowned Tibetan compositions that may be cited as predecessors (if not precisely as models) of the Great Trea-tise, mention should in the first place be made of the bstan rim texts composed by rNgog Blo-ldan-shes-rab (1059-1109) and by his pu-pil Gro-lung-pa Blo-gros-'byung-gnas.ll Another important prede-cessor was the Dam chos yid bzhin gyi nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan zhes bya ba theg pa chen po'i lam rim gyi bshad pa (Dvags po'i lam rim thar rgyan) by sGam-po-pa bSod-nams-rin-chen (Dvags-po-lha-rje, 1079-1153), a master who combined traditions of the bKa' -gdams-pa and bKa' -brgyud-pa orders; justly famous though it is, this last treatise is considerably shorter than Tsong-kha-pa's Lam rim chen mo.12 Other renowned early works from the bKa' -gdams-pa tradi-tion-the dPe chos rin chen spungs pa by Po-to-ba Rin-chen-gsal (1027/1031-1105), the Be'u bum sngon po by Rog Shes-rab-rgya-mtsho (Dol-pa dMar-zhur-ba, 1059-1131), a lam rim known as the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"26 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Be'u bum dmar po by Sha-ra-ba/ Shar-ba-pa Yon-tan-grags (1070-1141) and further texts of the dpe chos and be'u bum class by other masters of this school which are assignable also to the blo sbyong (mind-training) literature closely allied to the lam rim literature13-prefigure important parts of the Great Treatise. From the Sa-skya-:pa order there are the sNang gsum and (Blo sbyong) Zhen pa bzhi bral teachings of Vinlpa's path-and-fruit (lam 'bras) doctrine.14 And even though they are somewhat different in contents from Tsong-kha-pa's Lam rim chen mo, the sDom gsum rab dbye and the Thub pa'i dgongs gsal by Sa-skya-paI).c;li-ta Kun-dga'-rgyal-mtshan (1182-1251) might also be cited in the present context since they provide a comprehensive synthesizing exposition of Buddhist teachings. IS Later another Sa-skya-pa master, Rong-ston Sakya-rgyal-mtshan (1367-1449), wrote a lam rim-type work based in particular on the Prajnaparamita, the Shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa nyams su len pa'i lam gyi rim pa. In the Jo-nang-pa tradition, Taranatha (b. 1575) composed a bsTan pa la 'jug pa'i rim pa skyes bu gsum gyi man ngag gi khrid yig bdud rtsi'i nying khu. From the rNying-rna order a recent counterpart of the lam rim literature is provided by the rDzogs pa chen po klong chen snying thig gi sngon 'gro'i khrid yig Kun bzang bla ma'i zhallung by Dza dPal-sprul O-rgyan 'Jigs-med-chos-kyi-dbang-po (1808-1887),16 a work expounding the new snying t(h)ig teaching of 'Jigs-med-gling-pa (1729-1798) entitled rNam mkhyen lam bzang which is itself linked with the older sNying t(h)ig and the Ngal gso skor gsum cycle of Klong-chen Dri-med-' od-zer (1308-1363). Already contained in the earlier Bla ma'i thugs sgrub rdo rje drag rtsal treasure-text (gter ma) connected with Padmasambhava there is the Zhal gdams lam rim ye shes snying pO.17 Finally, amongst modem Bon-po works on rDzogs-chen, reference can be made to the ' Od gsal rdzogs pa chen po'i lam gyi rim pa'i khrid yig Kun tu bzang po'i snying tig by Shar-rdza bKra-shis-rgyal-mtshan (1859-1933).18 These works concerning the path, its stages and grades of course represent a quite diverse collection of texts with respect not only to their times of composition but also to their extent and to their method of presentation and contents. (The works listed here rep-resent only a small selection of compositions on the graded path. On some further lam rim-type works connected mainly with the Vajrayana, see below.) In the extensive list of more ancient works of the lam rim and blo sbyong class forming the second section in his valuable bibliogra-phy of older and rarer works of Tibetan literature, A-khu Shes-rab-rgya-mtsho (1803-1875) has enumerated some 250 Tibetan works."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 27 Not all of them are, however, directly comparable with Tsong-kha-pa's Great Treatise; and in addition to independent compositions this list includes commentarial works on Aryasura's Jataka-mala, on the Suhrl-Iekha ascribed to Nagarjuna, on Candragomin's Bodhisattva-sa1!lvara-vi1!lsaka, on Santideva's Bodhi(sattva)-caryavatara and Sik$a-samuccaya, and on Atisha's Bodhi-patha-pradipa.19 Among works of the Theravada tradition of Buddhism in the Pali language, the closest parallel to Tsong-kha-pa's Great Treatise is probably provided by Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga (c. 400 c.E.), a voluminous treatise concerned with the three main divisions into which it divides the path: ethical discipline (sila), meditative con-centration (samadhi) and discriminative understanding (panna). But unlike the other earlier texts just mentioned, many of which were doubtless known to Tsong-kha-pa, the Visuddhimagga, never ren-dered into Tibetan, would not have been available to him. A small part of a work which the author of the Visuddhimagga knew and used, Upatissa's Vimuktimarga/Vimuttimagga, was, however, trans-lated into Tibetan.2o In addition to the Lam rim chen mo, which he completed in 1402, Tsong-kha-pa also composed the Shorter Treatise on the Graded Path of Awakening (Lam rim chung ba, also known as the Lam rim 'bring or \"Middling Graded Path\") completed at Ri-bo dGe-ldan (or dGa'-ldan) Monastery in 1415,21 And included amongst Tsong-kha-pa's miscellaneous works (bKa' 'bum thor bu, contained in the second volume of his Collected Works) there is a short prose Lam gyi rim pa mdo tsam du bstan pa or \"Condensed Graded Path\" (sometimes referred to as the Lam rim chung ngu or \"Small Graded Path\")22 as well as an even shorter metrical work on practice entitled Byang chub lam gyi rim pa' i nyams len gyi rnam gzhag mdor bsdus te brjed byang du bya ba.23 Reference should furthermore be made to Tsong-kha-pa's Byang chub lam gyi rim pa'i brgyud pa rnams la gsol ba 'debs pa'i rim pa Lam mchog sgo 'byed, a metrical hymn of invocation to the masters who have transmitted the lam rim teaching, in which is included his well-known Yon tan gzhir gyur ma.24 Beside the genre of lam rim text digesting and synthesizing a vast body of sutra and sastra literature, there exist in Tsong-kha-pa's dGa'-ldan-pa/ dGe-Iugs-pa school two related, but neverthe-less distinct, categories of works devoted to grades on the path of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"28 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path spiritual realization. The first is composed of a large number of theo-retical manuals, generically known as Sa lam rnam bzhag, which are concerned with the stages (sa, bhumi) and paths (lam, marga) whose main source lies in the Prajfulparamita literature and which have been set out in the Abhisamayalarrzkara and its commentaries (a tra-dition on which Tsong-kha-pa composed his compendious Legs bshad gser phreng, begun in his late twenties). 2S The second category comprises works expounding the path of Mantra, a subject on which Tsong-kha-pa himself composed the voluminous sNgags rim chen mo (the Rgyal ba khyab bdag rdo rje 'chang chen po'i lam gyi rim pa gsang ba kun gyi gnad rnam par phye ba), completed in his forty-ninth year (1405). In this second category are also to be found treatises devoted to the stages of the path as defined in accordance with individual tantric cycles of the Vajrayana (Guhyasamaja, Vajrabhairava, etc.). Over the succeeding centuries followers of Tsong-kha-pa's dGa'-ldan-pa/ dGe-Iugs-pa tradition produced many works that are based on or derive from his lam rim compositions. His direct dis-ciple Hor-ston Nam-mkha'-dpal (1373-1447) composed a mind-training (blo sbyong) manual for the Mahayana. And two guides ('khrid yig) to the lam rim were composed by another of Tsong-kha-pa's pupils, sPyan-snga Blo-gros-rgyal-mtshan (1402-1471/2), who was born in the very year his master completed the Lam rim chen mo.

A. How he took rebirth in an excellent lineage As is set forth in the Eighty Verses of Praise (bsTod pa brgyad cu pa) composed by the great translator Nag-tso (Nag-tsho):7 In the excellent land of Za-hor [Bengal] in the east, Is a great city, Vikramanipo.ra. In its center is a royal residence, A palace extremely vast, Called the \"Golden Banner.\" Its resources, might, and fortune Were like that of the eastern emperor of China.8 The king of that country was Kalyanasri, The queen was Sriprabha. They had three sons, Padmagarbha, Candragarbha, and Srigarbha. Prince Padmagarbha had five queens and nine sons. His eldest son, PUDyasri, Is a great scholar of our time Known as Dha-na-shri.9 The youngest, Srigarbha, Is the monk Viryacandra. The middle [son], Candragarbha, Is our present venerable guru [Atisha). B. How upon that basis he gained good qualities How he gained good qualities is explained in two parts: 1. How, knowing many texts, he gained the good qualities of scriptural knowledge 2. How, engaging in proper practice, he gained the good qualities of experiential knowledge 1. How, knowing many texts, he gained the good qualities of scriptural knowledge Nag-tso's Eighty Verses of Praise says:lO At the age of twenty-one, He had mastered the sixty-four arts, 11"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"All forms of crafts, The Sanskrit language, And all philosophy. Atisha 37 As it states here, by the time he was twenty-one, he had become a full-fledged scholar after training in the topics of knowledge com-mon to Buddhists and non-Buddhists, the four knowledges-of grammar, logic, the crafts, and medicineP [5] More specifically, the great Dro-Iung-ba (Gro-Iung-pa) said that at age fifteen, after hear-ing Dharmakirti's Drop of Reasoning (Nyaya-bindu-prakaraIJa) one time, Atisha debated with a famous scholar, a non-Buddhist logi-cian, and defeated him, whereby his fame spread everywhere. Then, he received complete initiation from the guru Rahulagupta, lord of contemplation of the Black Mountain Temple,13 who had a vision of the glorious Hevajra and had received prophecies from Vajra<;lakini. He was given the secret name Jfianaguhyavajra. By train-ing through his twenty-ninth year in the Vajrayana with many gu-rus who had achieved spiritual attainments, he became skilled in all the tantric texts and instructions. When the thought occurred to him, \"I alone am skilled in the mantra vehicle,\"14 his pride was subdued by ~akinis15 in a dream showing him many volumes of the mantra path that he had not seen before. Then, his gurus and chosen deities, either in person or in dreams, urged him to become a monk, saying that if he did so, it would ben-efit vastly the teaching and many beings. Upon their urging, he be-came a monk, receiving ordination from an abbot who had attained a meditative concentration in which he engaged reality from one perspective, having reached the path of preparation.16 This abbot was a Mahasarp.ghika elder, a great upholder of the texts on discipline, called Silara~ita. As it states in Nag-tso's Eighty Verses of Praise, \"Your abbot was renowned by all as having attained the path of prepara-tion. \"17 Furthermore, Atisha was given the name Sri Diparp.karajfiana. Then, until he was thirty-one, Atisha trained in the higher and lower scriptural collections of Buddhist knowledge within the tra-dition of philosophy. In particular, at O-tan-ta-pu-ri,18 he heard teachings for twelve years from the guru Dharmarak~ita on the Great Detailed Explanation (Maha-vibha?a).19 Through becoming very skilled in the texts of the four basic schools,2Â° he came to know ac-cording to the different schools and without confusion even the fin-est details of what behavior should be adopted and what avoided in such rules of monastic discipline as those regarding how to give and receive things such as food. [6]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"38 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Thus, through crossing over the oceanlike tenets of our own and others' schools, he came to know accurately all the key points of the scriptural teaching. 2. How, engaging in proper practice, he gained the good qualities of experiential knowledge In general, the three precious scriptural collections21 include all of the scriptural teachings of the Conqueror. Thus, the three precious trainings must also include the teachings as they are realized.22 With respect to that, the scriptures and their commentaries repeatedly praise training in ethical discipline as the basis for all good quali-ties, such as the trainings in concentration and wisdom. Therefore, at the outset you must have the good qualities of knowledge that occur in the context of training in ethical discipline. a. That Atisha possessed the training in ethics23 That Atisha possessed the training in ethics is explained in relation to three aspects: 1. The superior vows of individual liberation 2. The bodhisattva vows 3. The vows of the Vajraytma 1) How Atisha possessed superior vows of individual liberation Nag-tso's Eighty Verses of Praise:24 I bow down to the elder upholder of the texts on discipline, Supreme of monks, possessing the glory of pure deeds. You, having entered the door of the sravaka vehicle,25 Guarded ethical discipline as a yak guards its tail. A yak is so attached to the hairs of its tail that when a single hair gets caught in brush, it will risk its life to guard that no hair be lost, even if it sees that it might be killed by a hunter. Likewise, Atisha, after receiving the complete vows of a monk, guarded at the risk of his life every minor fundamental training, not to mention the ma-jor fundamental trainings to which he was committed. Therefore, as it is said in Nag-tso's Eighty Verses of Praise, he was an elder who was a great upholder of the texts on discipline. 2) That Atisha possessed the bodhisattva vows Nag-tso's Eighty Verses ofPraise:26 You, having entered the door of the perfection vehicle, Developed the pure wholehearted resolve, and due to your"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Atisha 39 Spirit of enlightenment, you would not desert living beings-I bow down to you, intelligent and compassionate one. Thus, it says that he trained in many instructions for developing the spirit of enlightenment, which is rooted in love and compas-sion. In particular, relying on Ser-ling-ba (gSer-gling-pa),27 he had trained for a long time in the supreme instructions transmitted from the venerable Maitreya and Mafijugho~a to Asanga and Santideva, respectively. [7J Through this, as the Eighty Verses of Praise says:28 The one who set aside his own interests and took up The burden of others' interests is my guru [Atisha]. There arose in his heart the spirit of enlightenment that cherishes others more than oneself. That aspirational spirit induced in him the engaged spirit of enlightenment. He then learned the practices pursuant to his promise to train in the great waves of bodhisattva deeds, and with those good actions he never transgressed the boundaries of the code of conquerors' children.29 3) That Atisha possessed the vows of the Vajrayana Nag-tso's Eighty Verses ofPraise:30 Having entered the door of the Vajrayana, You saw yourself as a deity and possessed the vajra mindY Lord of contemplation, Avadho.tipa,32 I bow down to you who engaged in the secret conduct. Nag-tso expresses praise in general, calling Atisha a chief of yogis due to his reaching the concentration of the stage of generation, in which he saw his body as divine, and the concentration of the stage of completion, whereupon he attained the vajra state of mind. In particular, with respect to his guarding properly the pledges and not transgressing the boundaries of the tantric rules, the Eighty Verses of Praise says:33 Because you had mindfulness and vigilance, You had no unethical thoughts. Conscientious and alert, with no deceit or pretension, You were not stained by the faults of infractions. Thus, Atisha was not only courageous in promising to train in the ethical discipline of the three VOWS,34 but he also guarded that ethi-cal discipline by keeping his promises and not transgressing the boundaries of the rules.

That Atisha possessed the training in concentration 1) The training in concentration common to siitra and tantra His mind became serviceable by means of meditative serenity. 2) The training in the uncommon concentrations He reached a very stable stage of generation due to having prac-ticed the deeds of proficient conduct for six or three years.35 At that time, after hearing the secret tantric songs sung by 4iikinis in O(;l<;liyana, he committed them to memory. c. That Atisha possessed the training in wisdom 1) The common training in wisdom He gained a concentration of insight that was a union of medita-tive serenity and insight. 2) The uncommon training in wisdom He gained a special concentration of the stage of completion. Eighty Verses of Praise: It is clear that you achieved the path of preparation In accordance with the texts of the mantra vehicle. C. Having gained those good qualities, what Atisha did to further the teachings 1. What he did in India In the palace of the great enlightenment at the glorious Bodh-gaya, he upheld the Buddhist teaching three times by using the teach-ings to vanquish the poor instruction of non-Buddhist philosophers. With regard to the higher and lower of our own Buddhist schools, he furthered the teachings through clearing away the corruptions of ignorance, wrong ideas, and doubts. So it is that all of the schools, without partisanship, consider him a crown jewel. Eighty Verses of Praise:36 In the palace of the great enlightenment When all were assembled together, With speech like a lion's roar You confounded the minds of all Who argued for the poor tenets Of our own and others' schools."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Also:37 At Otantapllri there were Two hundred fifty monks, At Vikramalasila There were almost a hundred. All four root schools38 were present. You did not take up the boasts of the various schools But became the crown jewel of all Four followers of the Teacher39 In all of the areas Of the land of Magadha. [9) Because you stayed with the general teachings Of all eighteen sects [and thus were nonpartisan], Everyone received teachings from you. 2. What he did in Tibet Atisha 41 The royal renunciates, uncle and nephew,4Â° sent to India in succes-sion the two translators, Gya-dzon-seng (brGya-brtson-seng)41 and Nag-tso Tshul-trim-gyal-wa (Nag-tsho-tshul-khrims-rgyal-ba). Because they made great efforts to invite him again and again, Atisha went to Upper Nga-ri (mNga'-ris) during the time of Jang-chup-o (Byang-chub-'od). When they welcomed him there, his hosts prayed that he might purify the Buddhist teaching. Based on this prayer, he furthered the teaching through activities such as composing the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, a text that brings together the stages of practice, condensing all the key points of the slltra and mantra vehicles. Moreover, for three years at Nga-ri, nine years at Nye-tang (sNye-thang), and five years at other places in 0 (dBus) and Tsang (gTsang), he taught all the instructions for the texts of the slltra and mantra vehicles to fortunate students.42 The result was that he re-established the practices of the Buddhist system that had disap-peared; he reinvigorated those that remained only slightly; and he removed corruption based on misconceptions. Thus he made the precious teachings free of defilement. In general, the glorious Santarak~ita and Padmasambhava intro-duced the practices of the Buddhist system to the Land of Snow [Ti-bet] during the early dissemination of the teaching. However, the Chi-nese abbot Ha-shang (Hva-shang) caused the teaching to decline. He did not understand emptiness correctly and thereby denigrated the factor of method and negated bringing anything to mind, even vir-tues. The great master Kamalasila, after refuting Ha-shang well, es-tablished the Conqueror's intent; hence, his kindness was most great."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"42 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path In the later dissemination of the teaching to Tibet, some who fan-cied that they were scholars and yogis misconstrued the meaning of the collections of tantras. Because of this, they did great damage to the maintenance of ethical discipline, the root of the teachings. This excellent being [Atisha] refuted them well. Moreover, he caused their erroneous conceptions to disappear and then reinvigo-rated the flawless teaching. [10] Thus, his kindness reached all those of the Land of Snow. Furthermore, there are three ideal qualifications for an author of texts that elucidate the intent of the Sage in this way. The author (1) should have mastered the five topics of knowledge;43 (2) should possess instructions that are the key points for practicing the mean-ing of the topics of Buddhist knowledge which have been trans-mitted in an unbroken lineage through excellent beings from the perfect Buddha; and (3) should receive permission to compose the text in a vision of his or her chosen deity. If someone with anyone of these qualifications can compose a text, then when all three are present it is ideal. This great master was endowed with all three as follows: 1. With regard to how his chosen deities looked after him, Eighty Verses of Praise:44 Due to having visions and receiving permission From the glorious Hevajra, Trisamayavyllharaja, The hero Lokesvara [Avalokitesvaral, The noble and venerable Tara, and so forth, He listened always to the excellent teaching Of the profound view and the vast deeds of compassion Either in dreams or in person. 2. With regard to the lineages of gurus, there are two lineages: that of the vehicle common [to both the Hinayana and Mahayana] and that of the Mahayana. Within the latter, there are again two: those of the perfection vehicle and those of the mantra vehicle. Within the perfection vehicle, there are two more divisions-the lineage of the view and the lineage of deeds-and within the lin-eage of deeds, there are lineages descended from Maitreya and from Maftjugho~a, making three lineages in the perfection vehicle. Further, with respect to the mantra vehicle, there are five systems of lineages.4s In addition, there are such lineages as the lineages of tenets, the lineages of blessings, and the lineages of various"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Atisha 43 instructions. Atisha was endowed with instructions from these many lineages. The gurus from whom Atisha received teachings directly are as Nag-tso says:46 The gurus on whom you always relied Had achieved spiritual attainments; they were many: Santi-pa and Ser-ling-ba, Bhadrabodhi, and Jfianasri. And, in particular, you possessed Instructions on the profound view and the vast deeds Passed down over the generations from Nagarjuna. [11] It is well known that he had twelve gurus who had achieved spiri-tual attainments, and there were many others as well. 3. His mastery of the five topics of knowledge has already been explained. Therefore, this master was able to determine well the intent of the Conqueror. This master who had such qualities had an inconceivable num-ber of students in India, Kashmir, O<;l<;liyana, Nepal, and Tibet. To mention the chief of these, in India, there were the four great schol-ars Bi-do-ba (Bi-to-pa), Dharmakaramati, Madhyasinha, and K~itigarbha, all equal in knowledge to the Elder [Atisha]. Some also include Mitraguhya as a fifth. From Nga-ri, there were the transla-tor Rin-chen-sang-bo (Rin-chen-bzang-po), the translator Nag-tso, and royal renunciate Jang-chup-o. From Tsang, there were Gar-gay-wa ('Gar-dge-ba) and Go-kuk-ba-hlay-dzay ('Gos-khug-pa-Ihas-btsas). From Hlo-drak (lHo-brag), there were Chak-ba-tri-chok (Chag-pa-khri-mchog) and Gay-wa-gyong (dGe-ba-skyong). From Khams, there were Nal-jor-ba-chen-bo (rNal-'byor-pa-chen-po), Gon-ba-wa (dGon-pa-ba), Shay-rap-dor-jay (Shes-rab-rdo-rje), and Chak-dar-don-ba (Phyag-dar-ston-pa).

[12]"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"46 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path II. Showing the greatness of the teaching in order to engender respect for the instructions The greatness of the teaching is indicated by four qualities it elicits in the student: 1. Knowing that all of the teachings are free of contradiction 2. Coming to understand that all of the scriptures are instruc-tions for practice 3. Easily finding the Conqueror's intent 4. Automatically refraining from great wrongdoing A. The greatness of enabling one to know that all of the teachings are free of contradiction With regard to the teachings, Avalokitavrata's Commentary on the \"Lamp for Wisdom\" (Prajfia-pradipa-!iktl) says:50 Concerning \"teachings,\" the scriptures of the BhagavanS1 accu-rately teach that which is to be thoroughly known, that which is to be eliminated, that which is to be manifested, and that which is to be cultivated by deities and humans who wish to attain the ambrosial state [of a nonabiding nirvar:ta]. Thus the teachings are what the Conqueror explained well. Here, [in the context of the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment] to know that all the teachings are free of contradiction means to understand that they are the path by which one person becomes a buddha. Some are the main points of the path; some are the various branches of the path. Bodhisattvas make it their goal to accomplish the good of the world [all living beings]. Since bodhisattvas must take care of stu-dents who are followers of all three lineages [those of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas], they must train in the paths of those three lineages. For, as Nagarjuna's Essay on the Spirit of En-lightenment (Bodhicitta-vivaralJa) says:52 Because they engender in others Certain knowledge that accords with their own, The wise apply themselves Always and without mistake. And, Dharmakirti's Commentary on the \"Compendium of Valid Cog-nition\" (PramalJa-varttika-kariktl) says:53 It is difficult to explain to others The results of causes that are obscure to oneself."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Greatness of the Teaching 47 Therefore, if you have not ascertained something exactly, you can-not teach it to others. By stating, \"Those benefactors of beings who accomplish the good of the world through the knowledge of paths ... ,\" Ajita indi-cates in the Ornament for Clear Knowledge that knowing the paths of the three vehicles is the method for bodhisattvas to achieve the goal they have set.54 Also the Mother of Conquerors [The Eighteen-Thousand-Verse Perfection of Wisdom Sutra] says:55 [13] Bodhisattvas should produce all paths-whatever is a path of a sravaka, a pratyekabuddha, or a buddha-and should know all paths. They should also perform the deeds of these paths and bring all of them to completion. Thus, it is contradictory to propound that you should not train in the scriptural collections of the Hinayana because you are a Mahayana practitioner. There are shared and unshared paths to enter the Mahayana. Since the shared are those things that come from the scriptural col-lections of the Hinayana, how could they be something to set aside? Therefore, Mahayana followers must practice all those things taught in the Hinayana scriptural collections, with only a few exceptions, such as diligently seeking a blissful peace for oneself alone. This is the reason for extensively teaching all three vehicles in the very vast scriptural collections of the bodhisattvas. Furthermore, a perfect buddha has not extinguished just a por-tion of faults and accomplished a mere portion of good qualities, but rather has extinguished all types of faults and accomplished all types of good qualities. Mahayana practitioners seek to achieve this. Since they will then eliminate all faults and develop all good qualities, all the different types of good qualities derived from the elimination of faults and the acquisition of knowledge within ev-ery other vehicle are included in the Mahayana path. Therefore, ev-ery scripture is included as a branch of the Mahayana path for achieving buddhahood. For, there is no saying of the Sage that does not extinguish some fault or develop some good quality, and, of all those, there is none that a Mahayana practitioner does not practice. Qualm: In order to enter the perfection vehicle of the Mahayana, you do need the paths that are explained in the Hinayana scrip-tural collections. However, in order to enter into the Vajrayana, the paths of the perfection vehicle are not shared in common with the paths of the Vajrayana, because the paths are incompatible. 56 [14]"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"48 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Reply: This too is most unreasonable. The substance of the path of the perfection vehicle comprises the thought that is the development of the spirit of enlightenment and the deeds of training in the six perfections. That those must be relied upon on all occasions is set forth in the Vajra Climax Tantra (Vajra-sikhara):57 Even to save your life, Do not give up the spirit of enlightenment. And: The deeds of the six perfections Should never be cast aside. Further, such is said in many tantric texts. Such texts also state that on frequent occasions of entering mar:t<;lalas of highest yoga tantra, you must take both the shared and the unshared tantric vows. The former are simply the vows of a bodhisattva, and taking the vows means promising to apply your-self to the trainings of a bodhisattva, such as the three forms of ethi-cal discipline.58 Therefore, the perfection vehicle has no path other than the trainings that accord with your promise to practice the bodhisattva deeds after developing the spirit of enlightenment. Moreover, the above qualm is most unreasonable because you must promise to uphold all aspects of the teaching when you take the tantric vow. This is in accordance with what is said in the Dia-mond paka Tantra (Vajra-~aka), Integration Tantra (Sa1J1puti), and Va-jra Climax Tantra on the occasion of taking the pledges of Amitabha: Uphold all of the excellent teachings: The three vehicles, the external, and the secret.59 Some see a slight discrepancy in terms of what you are and are not to do and conclude that these are in complete contradiction, like hot and cold. Obviously, this is a cursory assessment. Apart from certain points about what is or is not to be done, the scriptures are very much in agreement. Therefore, upon entering the higher lev-els of the three vehicles or the five paths, for instance, you must have all the good qualities of the lower vehicles and paths. With regard to the path of the perfections, the Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines (Ratna-gulJa-sancaya-gathii) says:60 The path of all the conquerors of the past, Of those who have not come, and of those now present Is the perfections, nothing else. [15]"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Greatness of the Teaching 49 The path of the perfections is like the center post for the path that leads to buddhahood. Hence, it is unsuitable to cast it aside. As this is said many times even in the Vajrayana, the path of the perfec-tions is the path common to both sutra and tantra. By adding to this shared path the unshared paths of the mantra vehicle-initiations, pledges, vows, the two stages, and their atten-dan t practices-progress to buddhahood is rapid. However, if you cast aside the paths shared with the perfection vehicle, you make a great mistake. If you do not gain such an understanding, then, each time you gain what seems to be an understanding of an isolated teach-ing, you will abandon other teachings. When you develop a sup-posed interest in the higher vehicles, you will abandon in suc-cession the scriptural collections of the Hinayana and the perfection vehicle. Even within the mantra vehicle you will aban-don the three lower tantras and the like. Thus, you will accu-mulate the great karmic obstruction of having abandoned the teachings, which has a very grave fruition. In this context, this obstruction readily arises and is in danger of doing so. The source for this is indicated below. Therefore, having relied upon an excellent protector, solidify your certainty about the way that all the scriptures are causal fac-tors for one person to become a buddha. Then practice those things that you can practice now. Do not use your own incapacity as a reason to repudiate what you cannot actually engage in or turn away from. Rather, think with anticipation, \"When will I practice these teachings by actually doing what should be done and turn-ing away from what should not be done?\" Work at the causes for such practice-accumulating the collections, clearing away obscurations, and making aspirational prayers. Before long your mental power will become greater and greater, and you will be able to practice all of the teachings that you were previously un-able to practice. The Precious Teacher [Drom-don-ba] said, \"My guru [Atisha] is the one who knows how to bring all of the teachings within a four-sided path.\"61 These words are very meaningful. Because these instructions in the Lamp for the Path to Enlighten-ment guide students by gathering all the key points of the sutra and mantra vehicles into the path for one person to become a buddha, they have the greatness of producing the certainty that all of the teachings are free of contradiction. [16]"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"50 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path B. The greatness of enabling one to understand that all of the scriptures are instructions for practice In general, only the scriptures of the Conqueror provide the means to achieve all temporary and ultimate benefit and happiness for those who desire liberation, for only the Buddha is free from all error in teaching what is to be adopted and what is to be cast aside. Thus the Sublime Continuum (Uttara-tantra) says:62 Because there is no one in this world more wise than the Conqueror-No other who knows precisely with omniscience all [phenomena of the world] and the supreme reality-Do not disturb any of the collections of sutra set forth by the Sage himself. By destroying the system of the Sage, you will harm the sacred teachings. Therefore, the words of the Conqueror, the precious collections of sfltra and tantra, are the supreme instructions. Nonetheless, since students in this later time will not discover the intent of those words by delving into them on their own without depending on valid com-mentaries and the personal instructions of excellent beings, the great trailblazers composed treatises and personal instructions that com-ment on their intended meaning. Therefore, for something to be a pure personal instruction, it must bestow certain knowledge of the classic texts. No matter how well you learn it, a personal instruction is only something to be cast aside if it cannot bestow certain knowledge of the meaning of the Buddha's words and the great commentaries on their intent, or if it teaches a path incompatible with these. There are those who conclude that any classic text should be considered only an explanatory teaching, therefore lacking the key points for practice. They hold that there are separate personal in-structions that teach the core meanings that are the heart of prac-tice. They then imagine that there are two separate forms of the excellent teaching-a teaching that is explained to you and a teach-ing that you practice. Know that this attitude precludes the devel-opment of great respect for the stainless so.tras and tantras as well as the flawless treatises that comment on their intent. [17] Know also that you accumulate the karmic obstruction of abandoning the teaching when you see those classic texts as objects of contempt and say, \"Those are merely for promoting one's superficial knowledge"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Greatness of the Teaching 51 and eliminating others' misconceptions; they do not teach the deep meaning.\" Therefore, for those who desire liberation, the supreme and au-thentic instructions are indeed the classic texts. However, due to your limited intelligence and so forth, you may be unable to recog-nize those texts as the supreme instructions through depending on them alone. Thus, you must seek out personal instructions, think-ing, \"I will seek certain knowledge of those texts based on the per-sonal instructions of an excellent being.\" But do not think, \"The texts are without substance, since they merely promote a superficial knowledge and eliminate others' misconceptions; yet the personal instructions, since they reveal the deep meaning, are supreme.\" The great yogi Chang-chup-rin-chen (Byang-chub-rin-chen) said: Concerning instructions, complete mastery does not mean gain-ing ascertainment of a mere small volume that fits in the palm of one's hand; it means understanding all of the scriptures as instruc-tions for practice. Also, the great Elder's student Gom-ba-rin-chen-Ia-ma (sGom-pa-rin-chen-bla-ma) said that he understood all of the texts as instruc-tions for practice by \"grinding to dust\" all wrong actions of body, speech, and mind during one session of meditation on Atisha's in-structions. You too must come to such an understanding. The Precious Teacher [Drom-don-bal said that it is a mistake if, after studying many teachings, you feel a need to look elsewhere for how to practice the teaching. Thus, there are those who have studied many teachings for a long time, but do not know at all how to practice the teaching. When they wish to practice, they must look elsewhere. Their error is in not understanding what I have already explained. Here, the teachings are as set forth in Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge (Abhidharma-kosa):63 The excellent teaching of the Teacher [Buddha] is twofold: Those teachings having a nature of scripture and those having a nature of realization. As this says, there are no more than two types of teaching-scrip-tural and realized. The scriptural teachings determine the way that you take the teachings in hand, the procedures for practice; the teachings as they are realized are your practice of these procedures in accordance with how you have already determined them. [18]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"52 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Thus, these two serve as cause and effect. For example, it is like showing a horse the racecourse before you race. Once you have shown it, you then race there. It would be ridiculous to show the horse one racecourse and then race on another. Similarly, why would you determine one thing by means of study and reflection, and then, when you go to practice, practice something else? In this vein, the last of Kamalasila's three Stages of Meditation (Bhavana-krama) says:64 Further, what you meditate on with the wisdom arisen from medi-tation is just that which you know with the wisdom that has arisen from study and reflection. You do not meditate on something else. This is similar to how you show a horse a racetrack, and then race it there. Thus, these instructions include, in complete form, all the key points of the path from the scriptures and their commentaries-from how to rely on a teacher through serenity and insight. They then lead you through concise stages of practice in which you en-gage in stabilizing meditation on that which requires stabilizing meditation, and you analyze with discerning wisdom that which requires analytical meditation. By doing this, you will understand that all of the scriptures are instructions for practice. Otherwise, you will spend your entire life without discerning wisdom, practicing just some incomplete por-tion of the path and not the complete corpus. Thus you will not un-derstand that the classic texts are instructions for practice, but you will abandon them, seeing them as merely promoting superficial knowledge and eliminating others' misconceptions. It is evident that the topics explained in the classic texts are, for the most part, only things that require analysis with discerning wisdom. If you cast them aside when you practice, then how can you develop an understanding that sees them as the supreme instructions? If these are not the supreme instructions, then could you find a master whose instructions surpass these? Therefore, when it becomes clear to you that the profound and vast scriptural collections along with their commentaries are in-structions for practice, you will quickly understand that the classic texts of the profound tantric collections along with their commen-taries are also instructions for practice. [19J You will then become certain that they are the supreme instructions. You will completely overcome the misconceptions that consider these tantras to be only"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Greatness of the Teaching 53 teachings that should be cast aside because they are not actual in-structions for practice. C. The greatness of enabling one easily to find the Conqueror's intent The classic texts-the scriptures along with their commentaries-are the supreme instructions. Yet, even if beginners-persons with-out extensive training-d.elve into them, they will not discover their intended meaning without depending on the personal instructions of an excellent being. Even if they find the intended meaning, their search will require a very long time and a great deal of effort. How-ever, if they depend on the personal instructions of a guru, they will easily come to know the intended meaning. These instructions of the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment will readily bestow certain knowledge of the key points of the Buddha's word and the treatises. I will explain at length how this is done in the appropriate sections below. D. The greatness of enabling one to refrain automatically from great wrongdoing The Lotus Satra (Sad-dharma-pu1J~arika-s11tra)65 and the Chapter of the Truth Speaker (Satyaka-parivarta)66 explain that all of the Buddha's words directly or indirectly teach methods for becoming a buddha. There are those with misunderstanding who hold that some teach-ings are methods for becoming a buddha and some teachings are obstacles to becoming a buddha. They then differentiate the words of the Buddha into good and bad, reasonable and unreasonable, and great and small vehicles. Finally, they hold that some teach-ings are to be cast aside, saying, II A bodhisattva should train in this and should not train in that.\" Thus, they abandon the teachings. The Satra Gathering All the Threads (Sarva-vaidalya-sa1Jlgraha-satra)67 says: Manjusri, the karmic obstruction of abandoning the excellent teaching is subtle. Manjusri, whoever distinguishes some of the words spoken by the Tathagata68 as good and some as bad aban-dons the teaching. One who abandons the teaching, by having abandoned it, deprecates the Tathagata and speaks badly of the community. [20] If you say, \"This is reasonable; this is unreasonable,\" you abandon the teaching. If you say, \"This was set forth for the sake of bodhisattvas; this was set forth for the sake of sravakas,\" you"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"54 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path abandon the teaching. If you say, \"This was set forth for the sake of pratyekabuddhas,\" you abandon the teaching. If you say, \"This is not a training of bodhisattvas,\" you abandon the teaching. The fault of having abandoned the teaching is very grave. The King of Concentrations Sutra (Samadhi-raja-sutra) says:69 The wrongdoing of one who abandons the collections of sl1tras is far greater than that of one who causes the destruction of all of the stupas70 here in Jambudvipa. The wrongdoing of one who abandons the collections of sl1tras is far greater than that of one who kills arhats equal in number to the sands of the Ganges. In general, there are many ways that abandoning the teaching can occur. However, the way indicated above is the worst, so take pains to eliminate it. Moreover, since you overcome abandonment by merely gaining certain knowledge of the first two greatnesses as indicated above, you automatically are kept from wrongdoing. Seek such knowledge through extensive reading of the Chapter of the Truth Speaker and the Lotus Sutra. In the Sutra Gathering All the Threads you will find other ways of abandoning the teaching."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"3 How TO LISTEN TO AND EXPLAIN THE TEACHINGS III.

Contemplating the benefits of hearing the teaching The Verses about Hearing (Sruti-varga) in the Collection of Indicative Verses (Udana-varga) says:71 Through hearing, phenomena are understood, Through hearing, wrongdoing is overcome, Through hearing, what is meaningless is eliminated, Through hearing, nirval).a is attained. [21] Also: Just as someone dwelling inside a house Enshrouded in complete darkness Has eyes but does not see The forms that are there, So, also, a person born of noble lineage Although possessing intelligence, Does not know until told What is virtuous and what is not. Just as one with eyes Sees forms by using a lamp, So through hearing what is virtuous and what is not, You will understand what should be done. Also, the Garland of Birth Stories (Jataka-mala) says:72 Through hearing, you become faithful And your delight in virtue becomes steadfast; Wisdom arises and delusion will vanish-This is worth buying even with your flesh. Hearing is a lamp that dispels the darkness of delusion, The supreme wealth that cannot be carried off by thieves, A weapon that vanquishes the foe of confusion; It is the best of friends, revealing personal instructions, the techniques of method. It is the friend who does not desert you in times of need, A harmless medicine for the illness of sorrow, The supreme battalion to vanquish the troops of great mis-deeds, It is the best fame, glory, and treasure. It is the supreme gift when you meet with noble beings. Among an assemblage, it delights the wise. Also:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"How to Listen to and Explain the Teachings 57 The result of hearing is to engage in substantive practice; You will be released with little difficulty from the fortress of rebirth. Develop enthusiasm from the depths of your heart with regard to these benefits of hearing. Moreover, Asanga's Bodhisattva Levels (Bodhisattva-bhUmif3 says that you should listen with five ideas in mind; that is, with (1) the idea of a jewel, due to the fact that the teachings are rare because buddhas seldom appear nor do their teachings; (2) the idea of an eye, since the wisdom that arises together with hearing the teach-ings becomes greater and greater; (3) the idea of illumination, since the eye of wisdom that has arisen will see the real nature [empti-ness] and the diversity [of all phenomena]; (4) the idea of great ben-efit, since in the end the teachings bestow the results of nirval).a and great enlightenment; [22J and (5) the idea of being beyond reproach, since from this very moment you will attain the bliss of meditative serenity and insight, the causes of nirval).a and great enlightenment. To contemplate this is to contemplate the benefits of hearing the teaching. 2. Developing reverence for the teaching and the instructor The Siitra of K$itigarbha (K$itigarbha-siitra) says:74 Listen to the teachings with one-pointed faith and respect. Do not censure or deride the speaker; Honor your instructors-Develop the idea that they are like a buddha. Thus, as this says, view the instructor as being like a buddha. Elimi-nate disrespect; honor him or her with homage and goods by of-fering a lion throne and the like. Also, as the Bodhisattva Levels sets forth, listen without the afflic-tions [of arrogance and contempt] and without bringing to mind the five conditions of an instructor.75 Beingfree from arrogance means to listen with the following six attributes: (1) listening at an appro-priate time, (2) showing homage, (3) showing deference, (4) not being resentful, (5) practicing according to the instructor's words, and (6) not looking for the chance to argue. Beingfree from contempt means to respect the teaching and the one who gives it and not to belittle these two. Not bringing to mind the five conditions means to cast away the thought, \"I will not listen to this person because he or she (1) has fallen from ethical discipline, (2) is of poor lineage,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"58 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (3) has an unattractive physical appearance, (4) is inarticulate, (5) or speaks harshly and unpleasantly.\" Also, it is as is said in the Garland of Birth Stories:76 Stay on a low seat. Show the glory of discipline. Look with an eye of delight. Show respect and one-pointed obeisance, As if drinking a nectar of words. Show reverence and listen to the teaching With clear delight and a mind undefiled, Like a patient listening to the words of a doctor. 3. How you actually listen How to listen has two parts: 1. Abandoning the three faults of a vessel 2. Relying on the six ideas a. Abandoning the three faults of a vessel A vessel might have the following three faults: (1) being upside down; or (2) though held right side up, being dirty; or (3) though clean, having a leaky bottom. If it has these faults, then even though a rainfall from clouds assembled by the deities falls on it, the rain will (1) not go inside; [23] or, (2) go inside, but be unable to fulfill its function-to be drunk, etc.-because it is contaminated by filth; or, (3) not be polluted by filth, yet not remain inside and drain away. Similarly, even though you are staying in a place where the teach-ings are being explained, there is no great purpose in your hearing the teachings if you (1) do not pay attention; or, (2) though paying attention, misunderstand what is heard or listen with a bad moti-vation such as attachment; or, (3) though lacking these faults, do not solidify the words and meanings taken in at the time of hear-ing but let them fade due to forgetting them and so forth. There-fore, free yourself from all of these faults. The remedies for these three faults are indicated in the sutras in three phrases: \"Listen well, thoroughly, and hold it in mind!\"77 Moreover, as the Bodhisattva Levels sets forth,78 listen while want-ing to understand everything, staying one-pointed, attentive, with your mind focused, and reflecting with complete composure. b. Relying on the six ideas 1. Think of yourself as a sick person. Santideva's Engaging in the Bodhi-sattva Deeds (Bodhisattva-carytivattira) says:79"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"How to Listen to and Explain the Teachings 59 Since you must follow a doctor's advice, Even when stricken by ordinary illness, What need is there to mention those who are constantly stricken With the illness of so many faults, attachment and the like? As Santideva says, you have been sick for a long time with the ill-ness of the afflictions such as attachment-an illness that is long-lasting, intractable, and causes strong suffering. Therefore, you must recognize this to be your situation. Ga-ma-pa (Ka-ma-ba) said that if we were not in fact sick, then meditating on our sick condition would be misguided. However, stricken with the virulent and chronic disease of the three mental poisons [attachment, hostility, and ignorance], we are extremely sick, but we are completely un-aware that we are ill. 2. Think of the instructor as a doctor. For example, when you are stricken by a severe illness such as a wind or bile disorder, you seek a skilled doctor. Upon consulting your doctor, you are greatly de-lighted and listen to whatever your doctor says, revering him or her respectfully. Likewise, seek in this way a teacher who imparts the teachings. [24] Once you have found your teacher, venerate your teacher with respect and do what he or she says. While doing this consider it a privilege, not a burden. For, as the Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines says:80 Therefore, wise bodhisattvas, who have a strong thought to seek sublime enlightenment, vanquish pride decisively. Just as the sick rely on doctors in order to cure their illnesses, so you should rely on a teacher, applying yourself enthusiastically. 3. Think of the instructor's explications as medicine. Just as a sick person has a high regard for the medicine prescribed by a doctor, so too, you should view the instructions and explications that the instructor gives as very important, taking great pains to hold them in high esteem, and not squandering them by lapses such as for-getting them. 4. Think of earnest practice as the way to cure your disease. Sick per-sons know that their illness cannot be cured without taking the medicine prescribed by the doctor. They then take the medicine. Likewise, earnestly engage in practice after you have seen that you cannot vanquish such afflictions as attachment without putting into practice the instructions given by the instructor. Do not devote your-self just to piling up words in great numbers without engaging in practice."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"60 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Moreover, one or two doses of medicine will not do anything at all for lepers who have lost their hands and feet. Similarly, to put the meaning of the instructions into practice just once or twice is insuffi-cient for us who from beginningless time have been stricken with the virulent illness of the afflictions. Therefore, analyze with discern-ing wisdom the entirety of every aspect of the path and make effort that is like a river's current. As the great master Candragomin's Praise of Confession (Desanti-stava) says:81 Our minds are constantly confused; We have been ill for a very long time. What is achieved by the lepers Who have lost their arms and legs and only occasionally take medicine? [25] Thus, the idea of yourself as a sick person is extremely important, for if you have this idea, the other ideas will follow. However, if this idea is mere words, then you will not put the meaning of the instructions into practice in order to clear away the afflictions, and you will have been merely listening to these instructions. This is like sick persons who seek out a doctor. If they apply themselves only to getting the medicine prescribed, but not to taking it, they will not be freed from their illness. For, as the King of Concentrations Sidra says:82 Some people are ill, their bodies tormented; For many years there is not even temporary relief. Afflicted with illness for a very long time, They seek a doctor, in search of a cure. Searching about again and again, They at last find a physician with skill and knowledge. Treating the patients with compassion, The doctor gives medicine, saying, \"Here, take this.\" This medicine is plentiful, good, and valuable. It will cure the illness, but the patients do not take it. This is not a shortcoming of the doctor, nor the fault of the medicine; It is just the fault of those who are ill. Likewise, after you have left the householder's life for the sake of these teachings And have come to know the powers, meditative stabilizations, and faculties, How can you attain nirvcll)a without making effort At meditation, an effort at what is right?"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"How to Listen to and Explain the Teachings 61 Also: I have explained this very good teaching. Yet if you, having heard it, do not practice correctly, Then just like a sick person holding on to a bag of medicine, Your illness cannot be cured. Also, Santideva's Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:83 Physically, put these instructions into practice; What will be accomplished by mere talk? Will sick persons be helped By merely reading a medical treatise? Therefore, \"earnest practice\" in the statement, \"Think of earnest practice as what clears away the illness of the afflictions,\" refers to putting into practice the lessons that a teacher has imparted to you on what should be adopted and what should be cast aside. To do that, you need to know the lessons; for this, you need study. The purpose of knowing them through study is to do them. Therefore, it is vital to put the meaning of what you have heard into practice as much as you are able. [26J In this vein, the Verses about Hearing says:84 Even if you have heard a great deal, If you are not well restrained by ethical discipline, Then because of your ethical discipline you are scorned, And your hearing is not excellent. Even though you have heard very little, If you are well restrained by ethical discipline, Then because of your ethical discipline you are praised, And your hearing is excellent. Persons who have not heard much And are also not well restrained by ethical discipline Are scorned on both accounts, And their conduct is not excellent. Those who have heard a great deal And are also well restrained by ethical discipline Are praised on both accounts, And their conduct is excellent. Also: Though you might understand the heart of the scriptures through hearing, And might know the core of meditative concentration, Such hearing and knowledge are of little import If wildly you engage in coarse behavior."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"62 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Those who delight in the teachings taught by noble beings And practice accordingly with body and speech, Who have patience, delight their friends, and are restrained-They will attain the perfection of hearing and knowledge. Also the Exhortation to Wholehearted Resolve (Adhyasaya-sa1!lcodana-sidra) says:85 The foolish are sorrowful at the time of death, Saying, \"My practice was poor. Now what is to be done?\" Not having found depth, they will suffer greatly; Such are faults of delighting in just the words. Also: Like an actor before an audience watching a show Or like describing the good qualities of someone else who is a hero, You fall from earnest practice yourself-Such are the faults of delighting in just the words. Also: The husk of a sugarcane stalk has no substance at all, The taste that delights is inside. Through eating the husk, The delicious taste of molasses cannot be found. Just as it is with the husk, so it is with the words; The \"taste\" is in contemplating the meaning. Therefore, give up delighting in just the words, Always be conscientious, and reflect on the meaning. [27] 5. Think of the Tathagatas as excellent beings. Develop respect by remembering the one who set forth the teaching, the Bhagavan [Buddha]. 6. Wish that the teaching will endure for a long time. Think, \"How wonderful if, in dependence upon studying such teachings, the Conqueror's teachings would remain in the world for a long time!\" Furthermore, when you explain or hear the teachings, if your mind and the teachings remain separate, then whatever is explained will be inconsequential. Hence, listen in such a way that you deter-mine how these teachings apply to your mind. For example, when you want to find out whether or not there is some smudge, dirt, or whatever, on your face, you look in a mirror and then remove what-ever is there. Similarly, when you listen to the teachings, your faults such as misconduct and attachment appear in the mirror of the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"How to Listen to and Explain the Teachings 63 teachings. At that time, you regret that your mind has become like this, and you then work to clear away those faults and establish good qualities. Hence, you must train in the teachings. The Garland of Birth Stories:86 When I see the form of my misconduct Clear in the mirror of the teachings I develop a feeling of regret And tum my mind toward the teachings. With this statement Saudasa requested that Prince Sutasoma be-stow the teachings. Thereupon, the bodhisattva prince, knowing Saudasa's state of mind-that is, knowing that Saudasa had become suitable for hearing the teachings-gave him the teachings. In brief, develop the spirit of enlightenment, thinking: For the sake of all living beings, I will attain buddhahood. In or-der to attain this, I must train in its causes; for this, I must know those causes. For this, it is evident that I must hear the teachings. Therefore, I will listen to the teachings. Remember the benefits of hearing. Eliminate the faults of a vessel, and so forth, and listen with great delight. B. How to explain a teaching in which both the teaching and its author are great There are four parts to the explanation: 1. Contemplating the benefits of explaining the teaching 2. Developing reverence for the Teacher and the teaching 3. With what sort of thoughts and behavior you should ex-plain the teaching 4. Differentiating between those to whom you should and should not explain the teaching 1. Contemplating the benefits of explaining the teaching [28] It is very beneficial to impart the teachings without concern for worldly things-profit, honor, fame, and the like. For, as the Exhor-tation to Wholehearted Resolve says:87 Maitreya, there are twenty benefits of the generosity with which you give a gift of the teaching without concern for material things, profit, or honor. What are the twenty? They are as follows. You will come to have (1) recollection; (2) intelligence; (3) understanding; (4) stability; (5) wisdom; (6) supramundane wisdom; (7) little de-sire; (8) little hatred; and (9) little ignorance. Also, (10) demons"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"64 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path will not find an opportunity to harm you; (11) the bhagavan bud-dhas will think of you as a precious, only child; (12) nonhumans will guard you; (13) deities will bestow charisma and power on you; (14) enemies will find no opportunity to harm you; (15) friends will remain steadfast; (16) your words will be trusted; (17) you will attain fearlessness; (18) you will have abundant happi-ness; (19) you will be praised by the wise; and (20) your gift of the teaching will be worthy of remembrance. Develop belief in the benefits of explaining the teachings from the depths of your heart as they are set forth in many collections of sutra. With regard to the fourth benefit above, \"you will come to have stability,\" it is translated in the new translation of Santideva' s Com-pendium of Trainings (Sik$a-samuccaya) as, \"you will come to have belief,\" and in some old translations as, \"you will come to have diligence. \" 2. Developing reverence for the Teacher [Sakyamuni Buddha] and the teaching When the Bhagavan [Buddha] set forth the Mother of Conquerors [the Prajiiaparamita], he performed such acts of respect as arrang-ing the throne himself.88 [29] Likewise, since the teachings are re-spected even by buddhas, when you explain the teachings, be very respectful of the teachings and the Teacher [Sakyamuni Buddha] as well, remembering his good qualities and kindness. 3. With what sort of thoughts and behavior you should explain the teaching With regard to your thoughts, develop the five ideas set forth in the Questions ofSagaramati Sutra (Sagaramati-parip!ccha-sutra)-think of yourself as a doctor, the teachings as medicine, those listening to the teachings as sick persons, and the tathagatas as excellent beings, and wish that the teachings remain for a long time.89 Cultivate love for those who have gathered to listen. Give up jeal-ousy that fears the superiority of others; the laziness of procrastina-tion; the dispiritedness of being tired due to explaining something again and again; praising yourself and listing the faults of others; stin-giness with regard to explaining the teaching; and concern for mate-rial things such as food and clothing. Then think, \"Just this merit from teaching in order that others and I attain buddhahood is a favorable condition for my happiness.\" With regard to your behavior, wash and make yourself clean. Then, after putting on unsoiled clothing, sit upon a teaching seat and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"How to Listen to and Explain the Teachings 65 cushion in a place that is clean and attractive. It is said in the Ques-tions of Siigaramati Satra that if you recite the mantra for overcoming demons,90 then demons and deities of the demon class within a ra-dius of one hundred leagues will not come. Even if they do come, they will be unable to cause difficulties. Therefore, recite that mantra. Then, with a radiant face, teach, using examples, reasons, and scriptural citations and other accessories for ascertaining the meaning. The Lotus Satra says:91 The learned always give without jealousy Sweet-sounding teachings with manifold meanings. Having thoroughly cast aside laziness as well, They are not dispirited to repeat teachings again and again. The learned give up all that is repugnant And cultivate the power of love toward those around them. Day and night they cultivate the supreme teachings. [30] Using millions of examples, the learned Bring joy and delight to those listening to their teachings. They never have the slightest desire for worldly gain: Not thinking of sustenance-hard or soft foods, or drink, Of clothing, or bedding, or religious robes, Or even of medicine to cure an illness-They ask nothing at all from those listening to their teachings. Rather, the learned always think, \"May I myself And all living beings achieve buddhahood,\" and, \"Whatever teaching I impart in order to help the world Is a completely favorable condition for my happiness.\" 4. Differentiating between those to whom you should and should not explain the teaching Do not explain the teachings without being requested to do so; as GUl).aprabha's Satra on the Discipline (Vinaya-satra) says,92 \"It should not be done without request.\" Even when requested, it is necessary to investigate to see whether or not the potential student is suit-able to receive the teachings. And even when not requested, it is appropriate to explain the teachings to someone only if you know them to be a suitable recipient. Concerning this, the King of Concentrations Satra says:93 Should someone request you To bestow the teachings, first say, \"I am not trained extensively.\" Then say, \"You are knowledgeable and wise. How can I explain the teachings To one as great as you?\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Do not impart the teachings casually, But only after you have investigated whether the listener is a suitable recipient. If you know that the listener is a suitable recipient, Explain the teachings even without a request. Further, GUl)aprabha's Satra on the Discipline says:94 While standing, do not explain the teachings to one who is seated; while seated, do not explain the teachings to one who is lying down; while you are seated on a low seat, do not explain the teach-ings to someone on a high seat. It is the same also with regard to bad and good seats. Do not explain them to someone walking in front while you walk behind. Do not explain them to someone walking on the path while you walk on the edge. [31] Do not ex-plain them to someone whose head is covered or whose upper or lower robe is pulled up, whose upper robe is folded and placed on the shoulder, or whose arms are crossed in front with the hands on the shoulders, or whose hands are clasped behind the neck. Do not explain them to someone with a topknot, wearing a hat, wearing a tiara, or whose head is wrapped in cloth. Do not ex-plain the teachings to someone riding an elephant or a horse, to someone sitting in a sedan chair or carriage, or to someone wear-ing shoes or boots. Do not explain them to someone holding a staff, an umbrella, a spear, a sword, or other arms, or to someone wear-ing armor. It is suitable to explain the teachings to those who are the opposite of these. Further, these instructions apply to persons who are not sick. C. How a session should be concluded in relation to both hearing and explaining the teaching With strong aspiration dedicate the virtues that have arisen from explaining and hearing the teachings to your temporary and final objectives. If you explain and listen to the teachings in such a manner, then you will unquestionably receive the aforesaid benefits even from a single session. You will clear away all the karmic obstructions that have accumulated through not taking to heart the instructions on hearing and explaining the teachings and that result from not re-specting the teachings and the teacher and so forth. Further, you stop new accumulation of these obstructions. Also, insofar as you have taken to heart this way of explaining and listening to the teach-ing, the instructions that are explained will benefit your mind.

Without that certainty, no matter how extensively you explain the profound teachings, these very teachings often serve to assist your afflictions, like a helpful deity that becomes a demon. Consequently, it is said, \"If you mistake the date from the first day of the lunar month, the error lasts until the fifteenth day.\" Thus, those with intelligence should work at this way of successfully hearing and explaining the teachings and should have at least a portion of these qualifications every time that they explain or listen to the teachings.

How the students train their minds after having relied on the teacher (Chapters 7 and on) A. How to rely on the teacher, the root of the path There are two parts to the explanation of how to rely on the teacher: 1. A somewhat elaborate explanation for developing certain knowledge (Chapter 4)"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"70 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 2. A brief indication of how to sustain the meditation (Chap-ters 5-6) 1. A somewhat elaborate explanation for developing certain knowledge Atisha's Digest (Hrdaya-nik?epa-nama) states:95 One who abides in the lineage of the Mahayana Has relied on an excellent teacher. Also Dol-wa's (Dol-ba) arrangement of Bo-do-wa's Method ofExplain-ing (Po to ba'i gsung sgros) says: Of all the personal instructions, \"Do not give up the excellent teacher\" is the prime instruction. Thus, the excellent teacher is the source of all temporary happiness and certain goodness, beginning with the production of a single good quality and the reduction of a single fault in a student's mind and eventually encompassing all the knowledge beyond that. Therefore, the way you initially rely on the teacher is important, for the Scriptural Collection of the Bodhisattvas (Bodhisattva-pitaka) states:96 In short, attaining and bringing to completion all the bodhisattva deeds, and, likewise, attaining and bringing to completion the perfections, levels, forbearances, concentrations, superknowl-edges, retentions of teachings heard, dedications, aspirational prayers, confidence to speak, and all the qualities of a buddha are contingent upon the guru. The guru is the root from which they arise. The guru is the source and creator from which they are pro-duced. [34] The guru increases them. They depend upon the guru. The guru is their cause. Also, Bo-do-wa said: For attaining freedom there is nothing more important than the guru. It is sufficient to learn the activities of this life by watching others, but you will not learn them well without an instructor. Likewise, without a guru, how can we succeed in traveling to a place where we have never been, having just been reborn from a miserable realm? a. The defining characteristics of the teacher to be relied upon Generally, in the scriptures and commentaries many defining charac-teristics of the teacher are taught from the viewpoint of the individual"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 71 vehicles. However, the following is a description of a teacher who instructs you in the stages on the paths of the three persons of dif-ferent capacities and guides you to the Mahayana, which is the path to buddhahood. With respect to this, Maitreya says in his Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras (Mahtiyana-sutrala1J1ktira):97 Rely on a Mahayana teacher who is disciplined, serene, thor-oughly pacified; Has good qualities surpassing those of the students; is ener-getic; has a wealth of scriptural knowledge; Possesses loving concern; has thorough knowledge of reality and skill in instructing disciples; And has abandoned dispiritedness. Thus Maitreya says that a student must rely on a teacher who has these ten qualities. It is said that those who have not disciplined themselves have no basis for disciplining others. Therefore, gurus who intend to discipline others' minds must first have disciplined their own. How should they have been disciplined? It is not helpful for them to have done just any practice, and then have the result designated as a good quality of knowledge. They need a way to discipline the mind that accords with the general teachings of the Conqueror. The three pre-cious trainings are definitely such a way. Therefore, Maitreya indi-cated them with these three terms: \"disciplined,\" \"serene,\" and \"thoroughly pacified.\" With respect to what Maitreya said, \"disciplined\" refers to the training in ethical discipline. The Satra on the Vows of Individual Lib-eration (Pratimok?a-sutra) states:98 [35] These vows of individual liberation Are the bridle set with sharp nails. With constant effort they are fit For the difficult-to-rein horse of the straying mind. Also the Exegesis of the Discipline (Vinaya-vibhanga) states:99 This is the bridle for undisciplined disciples. As is implied above, the senses pursue improper objects and, like wild horses, lead you to engage in unsuitable actions. Just as a trainer tames a wild horse with a good bridle, so too teachers learn ethical discipline to control their senses and to turn toward suit-able actions with great effort. Hence, teachers have\" disciplined\" their minds, which are like wild horses."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"72 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path \"Serene\" refers to having accomplished the training of medita-tive concentration. Meditative concentration is a mental state in which the mind remains peacefully withdrawn. This is achieved by means of a reliance on mindfulness and vigilance in your ethi-cal discipline, turning away from wrongdoing and engaging in good activities. \"Thoroughly pacified\" refers to having accomplished the train-ing of wisdom. This is done by specifically analyzing the meaning of reality in dependence on meditative serenity, wherein the mind becomes serviceable. However, to have only the good qualities of knowledge that come from disciplining the mind with the three trainings is not sufficient. Teachers must also have the good qualities of scriptural learning. Therefore, \"wealth of scriptural knowledge\" refers to being erudite concerning the three scriptural collections and the like. Geshe Drom-don-ba (dGe-bshes ['Brom]-ston-pa) said that when the \"gurus of the Mahayana\" give an explanation, they must cause their students to have a deep understanding. When they are putting the teach-ings into practice, they must demonstrate what is helpful at a time when the teaching is on the wane, and what is useful in the situa-tion at hand. \"Knowledge of reality\" refers to a special training in wisdom-the knowledge of the selflessness of phenomena. In another way, it is said to be best if the teachers have a perception of reality; but, if they do not have it, it is acceptable for them to know reality through scripture and reasoning. Although teachers are endowed with these good qualities of scriptural learning and knowledge, it is not enough for them to have good qualities that are equal to or lower than those of their students; instead, they need qualities that surpass those of their students. The Verses about Friends (Mitra-varga) says:l00 People degenerate by relying on those inferior to themselves; By relying on equals, they stay the same; By relying on those superior, they attain excellence; [36] Thus rely on those who are superior to yourself. If you rely on whomever is superior-thoroughly pacified And endowed with ethical discipline And exceeding wisdom-You will become superior even to those who are superior. Pu-chung-wa (Phu-chung-ba) said, \"When I hear the stories of excellent persons, I emulate them.\" Ta-shi (mTha' -bzhi) said, \"I imi-tate the elders of the Ra-dreng (Ra-sgreng) monastic community.\""},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 73 Thus you must emulate those whose good qualities surpass your own. These six qualities-being disciplined, serene, and thoroughly pacified, having good qualities that surpass those of the students, the wealth of knowledge from studying many scriptures, and thor-ough knowledge of reality-are the good qualities obtained for oneself. The remaining qualities-being energetic, having skill in instruction, possessing loving concern, and abandoning dispirited-ness-are the good qualities for looking after others. Further, it says:101 Sages do not wash away sins with water, They do not clear away beings' suffering with their hands, They do not transfer their own knowledge to others; They liberate by teaching the truth of reality. Thus, buddhas perform no action-such as \"washing away others' sins with water\" -other than looking after others by accurately showing them the path. Among the four qualities oflooking after others, \"skill in instruct-ing disciples\" refers to being both skilled in the process of leading disciples and adept at causing them to understand. \"Possessing lov-ing concern\" refers to having a pure motivation for giving the teach-ings. That is, the teacher teaches with a motivation of love and com-passion and does not look for gain, respect, and so on. Bo-do-wa said to Jen-nga-wa (sPyan-snga-ba), \"Son of Li-mo, however many teachings I have explained, I have never taken pleasure in even a single thanks. All beings are helpless.\" A teacher should be like this. \"Energetic\" refers to constant delight in others' welfare. \"Has aban-doned dispiritedness\" refers to never being tired of giving an expla-nation again and again-to bearing the hardships of explaining. Bo-do-wa said: These five qualities-loving concern, knowledge of reality, and the three trainings-are foremost. My master Shang-tsiin (Zhang-btsun) is not very learned with regard to all the scriptures and cannot withstand dispiriting circumstances. Therefore, he does not even thank those who help him. However, since he has these five qualities, he is helpful to whomever is in his presence. [37] Nyen-don (gNyan-ston) does not have any skill in speech at all. Even when giving a single dedication of an offering, he can only think, \"None of these people here understands what I am saying.\" But, as he has the five qualities, he is helpful to whomever enters his presence."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"74 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path This being the case, those who achieve their own livelihood by praising or explaining the good qualities of the trainings, while not striving diligently to practice them, are not suitable to be teachers. That sort of meaningless praise is only words. It is similar to when someone who diligently seeks sandalwood asks one who makes a living by explaining the good qualities of sandalwood, \"Do you have any sandalwood?\" and that person replies, \"No.\" As the King of Concentrations SlUra states:102 In later times there will be Many monks without vows. Wanting to say, \"I am learned,\" They will praise ethical discipline, But will not strive diligently at their own ethical discipline. Having also said this concerning concentration, wisdom, and lib-eration, the King of Concentrations Satra states: Some people express The good qualities of sandalwood Saying, \"Sandalwood is like this: It is the pleasant aspect of incense.\" Then some other people Might ask them, \"Do you possess A bit of that sandalwood Which you so praise?\" They then reply, \"I do not have The incense that I praise To gain my livelihood.\" Just so, in later times there will arise Monks who do not strive at yoga And make a living by praising ethical discipline. They will have no ethical discipline. The sutra states the same for the remaining three qualities-con-centration, wisdom, and liberation. The guru who helps you to achieve liberation is the foundation of your deepest aspiration. Therefore, you who wish to rely on a guru should understand these defining characteristics and strive to seek one who has them. Also, those who wish to have students should understand these characteristics and strive to possess them. Question: [38] Because this is a degenerate time, it is difficult to find a teacher who has these good qualities in their entirety. There-fore, what should we do if we do not find such a teacher?"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 75 Reply: The Tantra Requested by Subahu (Subahu-parip!cchti.-tantra) states:103 Just as a chariot with one wheel Will not go down the path even though it has a horse, So too, without assistants for meditation, People will not gain attainments. These assistants should have intelligence, a good appearance, great purity, Be of reputable lineage, and inclined toward the teachings. They should have great confidence, perseverance, and have disciplined the senses. They should speak pleasantly, be generous and compassionate, Forbear hunger, thirst, and the afflictions, And not worship other deities and brahmins. They should be focused, adept, grateful, And have faith in the three jewels. Since those who have all such good qualities Are very rare in this age of strife, Mantra practitioners should rely on an assistant who has One half, one quarter, or an eighth of these qualities. Thus it says that assistants should have these defining characteris-tics in their entirety, or at least one eighth of these. It is explained in Dol-wa's arrangement of Bo-do-wa's Method of Explaining that the great Elder [Atisha] said, \"It is also the same with respect to the guru.\" Therefore, accept as the defining characteristics of a guru a minimum of one eighth of all the defining characteristics set forth here, combining those that are easy to acquire with those that are difficult to acquire. b. The defining characteristics of the student who relies upon the teacher Aryadeva states in his Four Hundred Stanzas (Catu~-sataka):104 It is said that one who is nonpartisan, intelligent, and diligent Is a vessel for listening to the teachings. The good qualities of the instructor do not appear otherwise Nor do those of fellow listeners. Aryadeva says that one who is endowed with the three qualities is suitable to listen to the teachings. He also says that if you have all these qualities, the good qualities of one who instructs you in the teachings will appear as good qualities, not as faults. In addition,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"76 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path he says that to such a fully qualified person the good qualities of fellow listeners will also appear as good qualities and not as faults. It is stated in Candrakirti's commentarylÂ°s that if you, the listener, do not have all these defining characteristics of a suitable recipient of the teachings, then the influence of your own faults will cause even an extremely pure teacher who instructs you in the teachings to appear to have faults. [39] Furthermore, you will consider the faults of the one who explains the teachings to be good qualities. Therefore, although you might find a teacher who has all the de-fining characteristics, it may be difficult to recognize their presence. Thus, it is necessary for the disciple to have these three characteris-tics in their entirety in order to recognize that the teacher has all the defining characteristics and in order then to rely on that teacher. With respect to these three characteristics, \"nonpartisan\" means not to take sides. If you are partisan, you will be obstructed by your bias and will not recognize good qualities. Because of this, you will not discover the meaning of good teachings. As Bhavaviveka states in his Heart of the Middle Way (Madhyamaka-hrdaya):106 Through taking sides the mind is distressed, Whereby you will never know peace. \"Taking sides\" is to have attachment for your own religious sys-tem and hostility toward others'. Look for it in your own mind and then discard it, for it says in the Bodhisattva Vows of Liberation (Bodhi-sattva-prtitimok?a):107 After giving up your own assertions, respect and abide in the texts of the abbot and master. Question: Is just that one characteristic enough? Reply: Though nonpartisan, if you do not have the mental force to distinguish between correct paths of good explanation and coun-terfeit paths of false explanation, you are not fit to listen to the teach-ings. Therefore, you must have the intelligence that understands both of these. By this account you will give up what is unproduc-tive, and then adopt what is productive. Question: Are just these two enough? Reply: Though having both of these, if, like a drawing of a person who is listening to the teachings, you are inactive, you are not fit to listen to the teachings. Therefore, you must have great diligence. Candrakirti's commentary says,108 \"After adding the three quali-ties of the student to the two qualities of being focused and having"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 77 respect for the teaching and its instructor, there are a total of five qualities.\" Then, these five qualities can be reduced to four: (1) striving very diligently at the teaching, (2) focusing the mind well when listening to the teaching, (3) having great respect for the teaching and its instructor, and (4) discarding bad explanations and retaining good expla-nations. Having intelligence is the favorable condition that gives rise to these four. Being nonpartisan gets rid of the unfavorable condition of taking sides. Investigate whether these attributes that make you suitable to be led by a guru are complete; [40] if they are complete, cultivate de-light. If they are incomplete, you must make an effort to obtain the causes that will complete them before your next life. Therefore, know the qualities of a listener. If you do not know their defining charac-teristics, you will not engage in an investigation to see whether they are complete, and will thereby ruin your great purpose. c. How the student relies upon the teacher One who has these qualifications of a suitable recipient of the teach-ings should investigate well whether a guru has the requisite char-acteristics as explained above. Then this student should receive the teaching's kind words from a qualified teacher. Even so, the biog-raphies of Geshe Drom-dan-ba and Sung-pu-wa (gSung-phu-ba) are not in accord with each other. Sung-pu-wa had many gurus and listened to any correct explanation. Thus, when coming from Kham (Khams), he even listened to a lay practitioner explaining the teach-ings alongside the road. His disciples said that this was an inap-propriate way to receive the teachings, to which he replied, \"Do not say that. I have received two benefits.\" Geshe Drom-dan-ba had few gurus-not more than five. Bo-do-wa and Gom-ba-rin-chen, themselves gurus, discussed which of these two ways was better. They agreed that Geshe Drom-dan-ba's way was better in these times when those with untrained minds still see faults in the teacher and lose faith. What they have said seems to be very true. Therefore, you should have few teachers. In general, a teacher is someone from whom you have received the teaching's kind words; specifically, a teacher is someone who skill-fully guides you with the instructions of all the paths in their entirety."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"78 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 1) How to rely in thought How to rely on the teacher in thought is explained in three parts: 1. A general indication of the attitudes needed to rely on the teacher 2. In particular, training in faith, the root 3. Remembering the teacher's kindness and being respectful a) A general indication of the attitudes needed to rely on the teacher The Array of Stalks Sidra (Ga1J~a-vyaha-satra)lCN states that you should respect and serve the teacher with nine attitudes. This includes the key points of all the attitudes that you should have in order to rely on the teacher. If these are further condensed, four attitudes remain. They are as follows: [41] 1) The attitude which is like the dutiful child. This means to give up your independence and submit to the guru's will. Dutiful children do not initiate an action on their own, but instead, looking at their parents' facial expressions, submit to their will and then do what they say. Look to the teacher in this way. The Satra on the Concen-tration Which Perceives the Buddha of the Present Face to Face (Pratyutpanna-buddha-sarrzmukhtivasthita-samadhi-satra) states:110 Students who rely properly on the teacher should always give up their self-assertiveness and instead act in accordance with the will of the teacher. This refers to a fully qualified teacher; it is said that you should not let just anyone lead you around by the nose. 2) The attitude which is like a diamond. This means to make the re-lationship between teacher and student close and stable, not to be split apart by anyone-demons, bad friends, and the like. The same so.tra states:lll And forsake fickleness in close relationships and changeability in facial expressions. 3) The attitude which is like the earth. This means to take on all the responsibilities of the guru's activities and not become dispirited by any of the responsibilities asked of you. It is as Bo-do-wa told Jen-nga-wa's monks, You have met with my geshe (dge-bshes) who is clearly a bodhi-sattva,1l2 and have practiced in accordance with his words. You have great merit! Now let this be a privilege, not a burden."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 79 4) How to assume responsibilities. This itself consists of six attitudes. The first,an attitude like the foothills, means that any suffering that might arise does not sway you. When Jen-nga-wa was staying in Ruk-ba (Rug-pa), Gom-ba-yon-den-bar's (sGom-pa-yon-ten-'bar) health declined due to the great cold. He then sought the advice of the venerable Shon-nu-drak (gZhon-nu-grags) as to whether he should leave. Shon-nu-drak replied, \"We have stayed many times in Indra's palace, a comfortable residence with good material ne-cessities. Only today do you have the experience of relying on a Mahayana teacher and listening to the teachings. Therefore, stay where you are, as is proper!\" The second, an attitude like a worldly servant, means to perform even the worst tasks in their entirety without wavering. For ex-ample, the scholar [Atisha] and all his translators had to stay in Tsang in an area of sewage and mud. Geshe Drom-don-ba took off all his clothes and cleaned up the filth. [42] He covered the area with dry white earth, from where no one knows. He even built a [stone and earth] maI).<;J.ala in front of the Elder Atisha.ll3 Therefore, the Elder exclaimed, \"Ah-ray!114 I had one like you in India, too.\" The third, an attitude like a sweeper, means to eliminate com-pletely all pride and feelings of superiority, and consider yourself to be lower than your guru. As Geshe Drom-don-ba said, \"The water of good qualities does not collect on the heights of pride,\" and as Jen-nga-wa said, \"In the planting time of spring, look at whether the green growth comes from the high mountain peaks or from the low valleys.\" The fourth, an attitude like a foundation, means to take on even the heavy responsibilities of the most arduous activities of your guru with pleasure. The fifth, an attitude like a dog, means not to get angry even when your guru despises or berates you. For example, each time that 00-lung-ba (sTod-lung-pa) met with Geshe Lha-so (dGe-bshes IHa-bzo), Do-Iung-ba would berate him. Lha-so's disciple Nyak-mo-wa (Nyag-mo-ba) said, \"This master hates us, both teacher and stu-dents!\" To which Geshe Lha-so replied, \"Do you think that he is berating me? To me it seems like I am being blessed by Heruka each time he does this.\" Also the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines (A~ta-siihasriktt) says:115 Even if the instructors of the teachings seem to despise and to ig-nore those who want their teachings, do not challenge them. Per-sist tirelessly and respectfully, and diligently seek the teachings."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"80 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path The sixth, an attitude like a ferry, means not to tire of deeds for your guru's sake no matter how many times you engage in your guru's activities. b) In particular, training in faith, the root The Formulae of the Three Jewels' Blaze (Ratnolka-dharalJi) states:116 Faith is the prerequisite of all good qualities-A procreator of them, like a mother Who then protects and increases them. It clears away doubts, frees you from the four rivers [ignorance, attachment, craving, and wrong views], And establishes you in the prosperous city of happiness and goodness. Faith cuts through gloom and clarifies the mind. [43] It eliminates pride and is the root of respect. It is a jewel and a treasure. Like hands, it is the basis of gathering virtue. It is the best of feet for going to liberation. Also the Ten Teaching Sidra (Dasa-dharmaka-sl1tra) states:l17 Faith is the best of vehicles, Definitely delivering you into buddhahood. Therefore, persons of intelligence Rely on the guidance of faith. Virtues will not arise In people who have no faith, Just as green sprouts do not grow From seeds scorched by fire. Thus, in light of what you gain when it is present and what you lose when it is not present, faith is the basis of all good qualities. Geshe Drom-don-ba said to Atisha, \"In Tibet there are many who are meditating and practicing, yet they are not attaining any spe-cial good qualities.\" The Elder said, \"All the significant and insig-nificant good qualities that pertain to the Mahayana arise from re-lying on a guru. You Tibetans only think of gurus as being common persons. How can good qualities arise?\" Then again, when some-one asked the Elder in a loud voice, \" Atisha, please give an instruc-tion,\" he laughed. \"Ha, ha. My hearing is very good. For me to give personal instructions you need faith, faith, faith!\" Thus, faith is extremely important. In general, faith is of many types-faith in the three jewels, faith in karma and its effects, faith in the four noble truths. However,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 81 here we are speaking of faith in the guru. With regard to how dis-ciples should view their gurus, the Tantra Bestowing the Initiation of VajrapalJi (VajrapalJy-abhi$eka-maha-tantra) says:118 If you would ask, 0 Lord of Secrets, how disciples should view masters, then I would answer that they should view them just as they view the Bhagavan. If the disciples view their masters in this way, They will always cultivate virtues. They will become buddhas And benefit the entire world. In the Mahayana slltras as well it is taught that you must think of the guru as being the Teacher. The texts on discipline state this as well, and the meaning of their statements is as follows. When you recognize someone to be a buddha, you will not discern faults in that person, and you will pay attention to his or her good qualities. [44J Likewise, completely cast aside your conception of faults in the guru, and train yourself to discern the guru's good qualities. That is, do as it states in the tantra cited above, the Tantra Bestowing the Initiation of VajrapalJi:119 Keep the masters' good qualities in mind Never seize upon their faults. Keeping their good qualities in mind, you will reach attain-ments. Seizing upon their faults, you will not. Your guru might have good qualities for the most part, and have only slight faults. If you examine your guru for those faults, this will block your own attainments. Whereas, even in the case of a guru who mostly has faults, you will give rise to your own attainments if you train in faith by fOCUJing on the good qualities while not look-ing for the faults. Therefore, once someone is your guru, whether he or she has small or great faults, contemplate the disadvantages of examining for his or her faults. Repeatedly think about eliminating that ten-dency, and then stop it. Even when the influence of factors such as an overabundance of afflictions or a lack of conscientiousness leads you to conceive a fault in your guru, take pains to confess this and restrain yourself from ever doing it again. Once you have done this, the influence of that conception will gradually diminish. Moreover, pay attention to the good qualities that the guru does have-such as ethical diSCipline, learnedness, and faith-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"82 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path and reflect on these qualities. Once you have become conditioned to this, you may notice that your guru has a small number of faults. However, this does not impede your faith because you are focus-ing on the good qualities. For instance, although you see that there may be many good qualities in people whom you dislike, your strong perception of their faults overwhelms any perception of their good qualities. Likewise, you might notice many faults in yourself, yet, if the perception of your good qualities is very strong, it over-whelms any perception of your faults. Thus, it is similar to the following example. The great Elder held the Madhyamaka view and Ser-ling-ba held the view of a \"true aspectarian\" Cittamatrin. Therefore, Atisha's view was superior to that of Ser-ling-ba. Still, Atisha upheld Ser-ling-ba as the guru who was unrivaled amongst his gurus, because Atisha had obtained the spirit of enlightenment and a general presentation of the stages of the Mahayana path in dependence upon him. [45] Reflect on your gurus' good qualities, and do not look for their faults. You must not discriminate among your gurus beginning with those from whom you have received one verse, even if they have such defects as faulty ethical discipline. For the Cloud oflewels Satra (Ratna-megha-satra) states:120 When you rely on the guru, your virtue increases and your non-virtue decreases. Understanding this, develop the idea that your abbot is the Teacher whether he or she is greatly or slightly learned, is knowledgeable or not, or has kept ethical discipline or faulty discipline. Just as you have a liking for and faith in the Teacher, so too you should have a liking for and faith in the abbot. Develop reverence for your masters and serve them. Think that you will complete the collections that lead to enlightenment and eliminate the afflictions that you still have in dependence on this. Then you will obtain pleasure and joy. With respect to virtue act in accord with the gurus' words, but do not act in accord with the gurus' words with respect to nonvirtue. Also the Questions of Householder Ugra Satra (Grha-paty-ugra-pariprcchtl-satra) says:121 o householder, some bodhisattvas strive diligently at receiving oral transmissions of teachings and doing recitations. They might have masters from whom they have heard teachings, obtained oral trans-mission, or absorbed a verse of four lines that contains a teaching on generosity, ethical discipline, patience, joyous perseverance, meditative stabilization, and wisdom, or the accumulation of the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 83 collections of the bodhisattva path. They should respect them be-cause of these teachings. The bodhisattvas might serve and ven-erate these masters without deceit. They might do so with all forms of gifts, respect, and worship for eons equal in number to the words, sentences, and letters in the verses that they were taught. Yet, still, 0 householder, they have not developed the respect for these masters that a master deserves. Since that is the case, what need is there to mention improper expressions of respect? c) Remembering the teacher's kindness and being respectful The Ten Teaching Satra says:122 [46) Develop the following ideas with respect to your teachers. I have wandered for a long time through cyclic existence, and they search for me; I have been asleep, having been obscured by delusion for a long time, and they wake me; they pull me out of the depths of the ocean of existence; I have entered a bad path, and they reveal the good path to me; they release me from being bound in the prison of existence; I have been worn out by illness for a long time, and they are my doctors; they are the rain clouds that put out my blazing fire of attachment and the like. Also the Array of Stalks Satra says:123 Youthful Sudhana, the teachers are those who protect me from all miserable realms; they cause me to know the sameness of phe-nomena; they show me the paths that lead to happiness and those that lead to unhappiness; they instruct me in deeds always aus-picious; they reveal to me the path to the city of omniscience; they guide me to the state of omniscience; they cause me to enter the ocean of reality's sphere; they show me the sea of past, present, and future phenomena; and they reveal to me the circle of the noble beings' assembly. The teachers increase all my virtues. Re-membering this, you will weep. Recollect your teacher's kindness in accordance with this statement. Personalize it by replacing \"they\" with \"these teachers\" in all of the phrases describing the teachers' kindness. Then picture before you your teachers. Saying the sutra's words out loud, concentrate one-pointedly on their meaning. In this same way, substitute these words in the former sutra [the Ten Teaching SzUra], as well. Furthermore, the Array of Stalks Sidra says:124 I, Sudhana, have come here Thinking one-pointedly, \"These are my teachers, instructors in the teachings,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"84 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path The ones who totally reveal the good qualities of all things, And then fully teach the bodhisattva way of life.\" \"Because of giving birth to these qualities in me, they are like my mother. Because of giving me the milk of good qualities, they are like my wet nurses. They thoroughly train me in the branches of enlightenment. These teachers turn away agents of harm; [47] Like doctors, they free me from old age and death. Like Indra, the chief of the deities, they let a rain of nectar fall; Like the full moon, they fill me with the white teachings of virtue; Showing the way toward peace, they are like the light of the sun; With regard to friends and enemies, they are like mountains; They have minds imperturbable as the ocean; They wholly care for me and are like pilots of a ferry.\" Thinking in this way, I have come here. \"These bodhisattvas have caused my mind to develop; They have produced my enlightenment as a buddha's child; Therefore these, my teachers, are praised by the buddhas.\" With such virtuous thoughts, I have come here. \"As they protect the world, they are like heroes; They are captains, protectors, and refuge. They are an eye providing me with happiness.\" With such thoughts, I respect and serve my teachers. In accordance with this statement, you too should remember your teachers' kindness with these verses, using a melody and substi-tuting yourself for Sudhana. 2) How to rely in practice Asvagho::;;a's Fifty Verses on the Guru (Guru-paficasika) says:125 What need is there to say much here-Do whatever pleases your gurus; Eliminate all that displeases them. Analyzing this, strive at it. Once you have understood Vajradhara's statement, \" Attainments follow proper reliance on the master,\" Thoroughly please your gurus In all things. In brief, you must strive to achieve what pleases your gurus and eliminate what displeases them."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 85 The three avenues to achieving what pleases your gurus are of-fering material gifts, respecting and serving with body and speech, and practicing in accordance with their words. This is also stated in Maitreya's Ornament for the Mahayana Satras:126 Rely on the teacher by way of Respect, material things, service, and practice. And also: A steadfast person who practices just as taught by the guru Pleases that guru properly. 1) Offering material gifts. The Fifty Verses on the Guru:127 If you always rely on your pledge master By giving things not normally given [48]-Your child, spouse, and your own life-What need to speak of ephemeral resources? And also: Offering to your pledge master constitutes Continuous offering to all the buddhas. Offering to them is the collection of merit; From the collections of merit and sublime wisdom comes the supreme attainment. Furthermore, Lak-sor-wa (Lag-sor-ba) said: If you offer what is bad while possessing what is good, you ruin your pledge. If the guru is pleased with this or you have nothing other than what is bad, then there is no fault. This is similar to the Fifty Verses on the Guru, which says:128 One who wishes for the inexhaustible Offers to the guru Whatever is slightly appealing, and Whatever is very special. Furthermore, the students' perspective differs from the gurus' per-spective. The students must do this offering, because the gurus are the supreme field through which the students accumulate the col-lections of merit and sublime wisdom. However, the gurus must not take the gifts into consideration. Sha-ra-wa (Sha-ra-ba) said: We use the word\" guru\" for whomever is pleased by practice and does not give even the slightest consideration to material gifts."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"86 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path One who does the opposite is not suitable to be a guru for those wishing to achieve liberation. 2) Respecting and serving with body and speech. This means such physical actions as bathing, massaging, cleaning dirt from the body, and nursing, as well as such vocal actions as pointing out the guru's good qualities. 3) Practicing according to the guru's words. This means to practice without contradicting what the guru instructs you to do. This is most important. For, as the Garland of Birth Stories says:129 The worship that you should do in return for my help Is to practice in accordance with my instructions. Question: We must practice in accordance with the gurus' words. Then what if we rely on the gurus and they lead us to an incorrect path or employ us in activities that are contrary to the three vows? Should we do what they say? Reply: With respect to this, Gunaprabha's Sidra on the Discipline states,130 \"If the abbot instructs you to do what is not in accord with the teachings, refuse.\" Also, the Cloud of Jewels Satra says,l3l \"With respect to virtue act in accord with the gurus' words, but do not act in accord with the gurus' words with respect to nonvirtue.\" There-fore, you must not listen to nonvirtuous instructions. The twelfth birth story clearly gives the meaning of not engaging in what is improper.132 [49] However, it is improper to take the gurus' wrong actions as a reason for subsequent misbehavior such as disrespecting, reproach-ing, or despising the gurus. Rather, excuse yourself politely, and do not engage in what you were instructed to do. The Fifty Verses on the Guru:133 If you cannot reasonably do as the guru has instructed, Excuse yourself with soothing words. Furthermore, when you rely on your gurus in this way, acquire a portion of their teachings. As Maitreya's Ornament for the Mahayana Satras states:134 By gaining a share of your gurus' teachings, You rely on the teachers in order to possess good qualities, not for material things. Bo-do-wa said:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 87 When Ananda was appointed as the Teacher's attendant, he thought of future followers of the teaching and then made the following vow, \"1 will serve and respect the Teacher under the conditions that I am not allowed to keep his unused robes or eat his leftover food, and that I am free to be with him at any time.\" We present-day followers do not value the teachings at all, but only value the guru's assigning status to us as demonstrated by each cup of tea that the guru gives to us. This is a sign of our deep corruption. As for how long you should rely on a guru, Bo-do-wa said: With each student who comes to me, my burden increases. With each who leaves, it decreases. If you stay apart from the guru, it is not beneficial. Therefore, practice for a long time at a moderate distance. d. The benefits of relying on the teacher By relying on the teacher, you will come closer to buddhahood; you will please the conquerors; you will not be bereft of future teach-ers; you will not fall into miserable realms; neither bad karma nor afflictions will overpower you; through mindfulness of the bodhi-sattva deeds and by not contradicting them your collection of good qualities will continue to increase, and you will reach all of your provisional and final goals; after obtaining virtue through serving and respecting the teacher with thought and practice, you will ac-complish others' welfare, as well as your own, and complete the collections of merit and sublime wisdom. [50] In that vein the Array of Stalks Sidra says:135 Child of good lineage, bodhisattvas whom teachers properly sup-port do not fall into miserable realms. Bodhisattvas whom teach-ers take into consideration do not contradict the bodhisattva train-ing. Bodhisattvas for whom teachers care are elevated above the world. Bodhisattvas who have served and respected their teachers act without forgetting any of the bodhisattva deeds. Bodhisattvas whom teachers fully look after are not overcome by bad karma or afflictions. And also:136 Child of good lineage, the bhagavan buddhas are pleased with bodhisattvas who have engaged in what their teachers teach them. Bodhisattvas who are content not to contradict their teachers' words will come closer to becoming an omniscient one. Teachers"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"88 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path will be closer to one who has no doubt about their words. Bodhi-sattvas who bring to mind their teachers will fulfill all of their aims. And also the Sidra of Showing the Tathagata's Inconceivable Secret (Tathiigatacintya-guhya-nirdeSa-sutra) says:137 Sons and daughters of good lineage, rely upon, become emotion-ally closer to, serve, and venerate the guru with great respect. If you do so, your thought will be virtuous through hearing virtu-ous teachings, whereby your practice as well will be virtuous. Then, through creating virtuous karma and becoming virtuous, you will please your virtuous friends. You also will not bring suf-fering upon others or yourself because you will not create non-virtuous karma but will only cultivate virtue. As a result of guard-ing others and yourself, you will complete the path to unsurpassed enlightenment, and therefore will be able to work for the welfare of living beings who have entered wrong paths. [51] Thus, once bodhisattvas have relied on the guru, they will complete all their collections of good qualities. Furthermore, by respecting and serving your teachers you ex-haust karma whose effects you would otherwise experience in the miserable realms. Your action of serving the teacher expends these miserable effects and replaces them with only slight harm to your body and mind in this lifetime, either in actuality or in dreams. In addition, the benefits of respecting and serving your teachers are tremendous, such as a collection of virtue which surpasses even the roots of virtue that you derive from making offerings to limitless buddhas, and so forth. As the Sutra of K$itigarbha says:138 Those whom the teachers care for will purify the karma that would otherwise cause them to wander through the miserable realms for ten million limitless eons. They purify this karma with harm to their bodies and minds in this lifetime. This harm includes sick-ness such as an infectious disease with fever and calamities such as famine. They may purify their karma by merely undergoing something as little as a dream or a scolding. They produce more roots of virtue in one morning than those who give gifts to, wor-ship, or observe precepts from limitless tens of millions of bud-dhas. Those who respect and serve their gurus are endowed with unimaginable good qualities. And also: Notice that all of the buddhas' immeasurable good qualities of transforming others' minds arise from this proper reliance on the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 89 teacher. Therefore, rely on, become close to, serve, and venerate the guru, just as you would the buddhas. Also, the Garland of Birth Stories states:139 Any intelligent person should not be distant from excellent beings And should rely on these virtuous beings in a disciplined manner. Once you are close to them, particles of their good qualities Will stick to you automatically. Bo-do-wa said: For the most part, we are in great danger of becoming like a worn animal skin. Just as when you drag a worn skin over the ground, debris sticks but gold coins do not, so it is that if you rely on teach-ers only occasionally their good qualities do not stick to you but each slight fault does. Therefore, to be successful, rely continu-ously on your teachers. [52] e. The faults of not relying on the teacher If you have taken someone as your teacher and then your method of reliance is wrong, not only will you be harmed by much mad-ness and sickness in this lifetime, but in future lifetimes as well you will experience immeasurable suffering in miserable realms for an immeasurable period of time. The Tantra Bestowing the Initiation of Vajrapi\"rt:zi states: 140 \"Bhagavan, what sort of fruition is there for those who reproach their masters?\" The Bhagavan answered, \"Vajrapal).i, do not ask this question, for the answer will frighten the world, including the deities. However, Lord of Secrets, I will say something. 0 hero, listen carefully: As I have explained, any of the unbearable hells Resulting from such karma as the deeds of immediate retribution Are said to be the abode of those who reproach their teachers. They must stay there for limitless eons. Therefore, never reproach your master On any occasion.\" Also the Fifty Verses on the Guru says:141 You who despise the master-You greatly confused person-Will die by poison, demons, infectious disease, Leprosy, contagious fever, or other illnesses."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"90 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path You will also go to a hell After being killed by a king, or a fire, Or by poisonous snakes, water, t;iaktis,142 thieves, Demons, or deceptive spirits. Never disturb in any way The minds of the masters. For, if you are confused and do so, You will definitely roast in a hell. It is explained that those who despise Their masters will abide In any of the frightful hells that have been explained-Such as the Unrelenting. Also, a citation from the Commentary on the Difficult Points of the \"Black Enemy of Yam a\" (Kr$r;a-yamari-pafl.jikii), composed by the great adept Ratnakarasanti, states:143 Someone who hears even a single verse And does not conceive its speaker to be his or her guru Will be reborn one hundred times as a dog And then will take rebirth in a bad caste. Furthermore, good qualities that have not yet developed will not develop, and those that have been developed will degenerate and then disappear. [53J The SiUra on the Concentration Which Perceives the Buddha of the Present Face to Face states:l44 If the students remain resentful, intractable, or hostile toward the guru, they have no way to obtain good qualities. It is also the same if they do not develop the idea that the teacher is indistinguish-able from the Teacher. This is explained as follows: if you do not respect persons of the third vehiclel45 or monks who impart the teachings, or do not think of them as being the Teacher or as gu-rus, you have no way to obtain the good qualities that you have not yet obtained. Also, you will only waste those qualities that you have already obtained, for, as a result of not respecting these people, the teachings will disappear from your mind. Moreover, if you rely on nonvirtuous teachers and bad friends, your good qualities will slowly diminish and all of your faults will increase. Then everything that is unwanted will develop. Therefore, always avoid them. The Mindfulness of the Excellent Teaching (Sad-dharmanusmrty-upasthana) states:146 The basis of all attachment, hostility, and ignorance is bad friends; they are like a poisonous tree trunk."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Relying on the Teacher 91 The Great Final Nirvt1IJa Sidra (Maha-parinirvt1IJa-siUra) also says that bodhisattvas do not fear mad elephants and the like in the same way that they fear bad friends.147 The former merely destroy the body, whereas the latter destroy both virtue and a pure mind. More-over, it states that mad elephants and bad friends respectively de-stroy the body of flesh and the body of the teachings. Even more, the former cannot propel you into miserable realms, whereas the latter definitely can. Also, the Chapter of the Truth Speaker states:148 There are those whose minds are seized by bad friends, as if by poisonous snakes, But have forsaken the poison's antidote, the teacher. Alas, even if they listen to the precious and sublime teaching, They will fall into the great abyss of unrestraint. Also, the Verses about Friends says:149 The wise should not befriend Those who are without faith or who are stingy, Those who lie, or who speak divisively; They should not accompany sinful persons. Even those who do not sin Create the doubt that they might be doing so If they rely on those who do sin, Thereby increasing that which is unpleasant. [54] The person who relies on the unreliable Will have faults as a result, Just as unsmeared arrows are tainted When arrows smeared with poison are placed in the same quiver. By relying on nonvirtuous teachers, your previously existent wrongdoing-deeds wrong by nature and deeds wrong by prohi-bition-does not diminish, and new wrongdoing increases. Geshe Drom-don-ba said: The worst person, though keeping good company, does not be-come better than middling. The best, when keeping company with the worst, readily becomes part of the worst. f. A summary of the meaning of the previous five parts Thus, you must also understand as explained above the instruc-tion that is renowned as \"guru yoga.\"150 Yet, you will get nowhere by training in an object of meditation for just a single session. When you practice a teaching from the heart, you must rely for a long time"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"92 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path on an excellent teacher who guides you accurately. Moreover, it is as Chay-ga-wa (mChad-ka-ba) said, \"When relying on the guru, there is the chance that you might give up your guru.\" So, if you rely without knowing how, you will not profit, but lose. Therefore, these topics concerning reliance on the teacher are clearly the foundation of our deepest aspiration, which is more important than anything else. Consequently, I have taken citations from uncorrupted scriptures and their commentaries, which are easy to understand as well as inspiring, and I have given a general overview that is adorned with the sayings of excellent persons who are engaged in the meaning of the scriptures. Understand this in detail from other sources. Our afflictions are extremely coarse. Some listen to the teachings given by many teachers. They do not know how to rely on the guru, and, even if they know how, they do not do it. Therefore, they will incur immeasurable misdeeds that are related to their improper reliance on the guru. Moreover, they will find it difficult to develop an awareness of practices such as confession of former wrongdo-ing and restraint from future wrongdoing. Thus, after you have understood the benefits and faults as pre-viously explained, reflect on them repeatedly. [55] Those whose practice of relying on the teacher was improper in previous lives should achieve an attitude of confession and restraint from the depths of their hearts. Exert yourself in the practice of those teachings for which you are suited as a recipient, and repeatedly contemplate the complete qualifications of your teacher. Make many aspirational prayers and accumulate the collections of merit and sublime wisdom as causes for having such a teacher to look after you until you attain enlight-enment. Once you have done this, you will quickly become like the conquerors' child Sadaprarudita, who had perfect courage, and the youthful Sudhana, who knew no limit in his search for teachers. lSI"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"5 THE MEDITATION SESSION 2.

What to do during the actual meditation session 2. What to do in between meditation sessions 1) What to do during the actual meditation session The actual meditation session is divided into three phases: (1) the preparation; (2) the actual session; and (3) the conclusion. a) Preparation The six aspects of preparation are the activities of Ser-ling-ba. There-fore, (1) clean well the place where you are staying, and neatly ar-range the representations of the Buddha's body, speech, and mind. (2) Obtain offerings without deceit, and arrange them beautifully. (3) Sit up straight upon a comfortable seat in a suitable posture, your legs either in the full or half-lotus position, and then absorb your-self in the practices of going for refuge and developing the spirit of enlightenment. Asanga's Sravaka Levels (Sravaka-bhurni)152 says to sit in the full lotus posture upon a throne, low seat, or the like in order to clear away obscurations such as longing for desirable objects, and to walk back and forth in order to clear your mind of the obscura-tions of sleepiness and lethargy. (4) Imagine that seated in the space before you are the gurus of the vast and profound lineages, as well as immeasurable buddhas, noble bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, sravakas, and those who abide in the Buddha's word.153 Then visu-alize the field for accumulating the collections of merit and sub-lime wisdom. (5) The cooperative conditions for the production of the path in your mind are (1) the accumulation of the collections, which are favorable conditions, and (2) the purification of your mind from obscurations, which are unfavorable conditions. [56] If you lack these cooperative conditions, it is extremely difficult to produce the path, even if you take pains to sustain the meditations that are the substantial causes of the path. Now you must purify your mind with the seven branches of worship, which comprise the crucial points for accumulating the collections and purifying the mind of obscurations. With respect to the seven branches of worship, the first, the branch of obeisance, includes the combination of physical, verbal, and mental obeisance. It is expressed in the first verse of the Prayer of Sarnantabhadra (Sarnantabhadra-carya-pra1!idhana ):154 I bow down with a clear mind, body, and speech To alllions-among-humans,tS5 leaving none out-Those who traverse the three times in the worlds Of the ten directions, however many there may be."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 95 This verse is a sincere and respectful physical, verbal, and mental obeisance that does not simply conform to what others do. Do not take as your object of meditation the buddhas of a single direction in the universe or of a single time. Rather, take all the conquerors who reside in all ten directions as well as those who have already visited this world previously, will visit here in the future, and are appearing at present. The master Ye-shay-day (Ye-shes-sde) ex-plains in his commentary,tS6 \"Even if you bow down to one bud-dha, the merit is immeasurable. What need is there to mention the merit of bowing down while imagining that vast number of bud-dhas?\" In regard to physical, verbal, and mental obeisance, physical obeisance is expressed by the second verse: I make obeisance to all the conquerors, With bowing bodies as numerous as the particles of those worlds, Perceiving all of the conquerors Through the strength of prayers that aspire to auspicious deeds. Imagine all the conquerors abiding in all directions and times as if you are actually perceiving them as objects of your mind. Also, as you bow down, imagine duplicate images of your body emanat-ing from your body in a number equal to the minute particles of the buddhas' realms. Moreover, you should have initially been motivated by the strength of deep faith in the auspicious deeds of the objects of your obeisance. The master Ye-shay-day explains,157 \"If even an obeisance with one body has great merit, one with a vast number of bodies has extremely great merit.\" Mental obeisance is expressed by the next verse: Upon one particle there are buddhas as numerous as the particles of those worlds, and All are seated in the midst of their children. In this way, all are spheres of reality. I imagine conquerors filling all of those particles. Buddhas are seated even upon each of the most minute particles and are equal in number to all of those particles. Each buddha is surrounded by bodhisattva disciples. Mental obeisance develops belief through recollecting the buddhas' good qualities. Verbal obeisance is expressed by the next verse: In praise of all the sugatas,158 I express the excellence of all the conquerors"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"96 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path With all the sound of an ocean of voices in song And oceans of inexhaustible praise. [57] First, in accordance with scripture, imagine that immeasurable heads emanate from each of your immeasurable bodies and that immeasurable tongues emanate from each head. Vocal obeisance is expressing with pleasant song the inexhaustible praises of the buddhas' good qualities. In this verse \"song\" means praise. The song's \"voices\" are its causes; that is, tongues. \"Ocean\" is a term for multiplicity. With respect to the second branch of worship, offerings, there are both surpassable and unsurpassable offerings. The former is ex-pressed by the next two verses: I offer to the conquerors Exquisite flowers, the best garlands, Musical instruments, ointments, excellent umbrellas, Superior lamps, and choice incenses. I make offerings to the conquerors With the best garments, superior perfumes, Fragrant powders piled as high as Mount Meru-All in the most excellent arrangements. \"Exquisite flowers\" are wonderful, loose flowers such as those of the human and divine regions. \"Garlands\" are various flowers that are alternately strung together. Both of these terms include all types of real and imagined flowers. \"Musical instruments\" are stringed, wind, and percussion instruments. \"Ointments\" are ointments of fragrant incense for the body. \"Excellent umbrellas\" are the best umbrellas. \"Lamps\" includes luminous precious jewels as well as fragrant and luminous lamps such as butter lamps. \"Burning in-censes\" are single-fragrance and mixed-fragrance incenses. \"The best garments\" are the best of every kind of apparel. \"Superior perfumes\" is said to be scented water given in offering bowls; it includes such water as that which is infused with a smell that spreads its odor into a universe of three billion world systems. \"Fra-grant powders\" are equal in height and width to Mount Meru. They are also either alternating rows of colored sand for drawing a mar:t<;lala or fragrant incense powders suitable to be scattered or burned which have already been wrapped into parcels. \"Arrange-ments\" refers to all the above; they should be predominantly good, ornamental, and varied. The next verse describes unsurpassable offerings:"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 97 I imagine all unsurpassable and vast offerings For all the conquerors. With the strength of my faith in auspicious deeds I bow down and make offerings to all the conquerors. Surpassable offerings are those of worldly persons. Therefore, unsurpassable offerings are completely good things created by those with power, such as bodhisattvas. The two final lines of this verse should be affixed to all of the above verses in which the sentiment of these two lines is not present. They indicate your motivation and the intended recipients of your obeisance and offering. The next verse describes the third branch of worship, confession of sins: Whatever sins I have done With body, speech, or mind Under the influence of attachment, hostility, or ignorance I confess each and everyone of them. [58] The nature of sin is that the three mental poisons cause you to use your body, speech, or mind to actually engage in an activity-that is, to do it yourself-or to enjoin someone else to do it, or to rejoice in someone else's having done it. So as to broadly include all of this, the verse says, \"Whatever.\" To confess sin is to recall the faults of your earlier sins and then to regret them. Confess them from the depths of your heart with an attitude of restraint toward future sin. When you do this, you prevent the growth of the sins you did be-fore and discontinue committing them in the future. The next verse expresses the fourth branch of worship, rejoicing: I rejoice in all merit, whatever it may be, Of all the conquerors of the ten directions, conqueror's children, Pratyekabuddhas, those with more to learn, Those with no more to learn, and all ordinary beings. \"Rejoicing\" means to remember the benefits of the virtues of these five types of persons,159 and then to cultivate delight in them as a poor person would with a discovered treasure. The next verse expresses the fifth branch of worship, imploring to turn the wheel of the teaching: I implore all the protectors, Lights of the world in the ten directions Who have reached buddhahood, which is without attachment, To turn the peerless wheel of the teaching."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"98 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Imploring to turn the wheel of the teaching refers to first imagin-ing that duplicate images of your body emanate from your body in a number equal to the buddhas of the ten directions. You then re-quest them to give the teachings. These buddhas reside in the bud-dha-realms of the ten directions and do not wait long to teach after awakening into enlightenment and gaining the knowledge which is without attachment and without hindrance. The master Ye-shay-day cites160 in his commentary the phrase \"awakened into enlight-enment\" and explains it. The next verse expresses the sixth branch of worship, supplication: I supplicate with palms joined in prayer Those wishing to demonstrate their final nirvaDa-Please stay for eons equal in number to the particles of the universe In order to bring happiness and benefit to all beings. Supplication involves imagining immeasurable duplicate images of your body. In front of you are the buddhas in the buddha-realms of the ten directions who are teaching how to pass into final nirvaDa. You then request that they stay for eons equal to the number of minute particles within each of the buddha-realms in order to bring temporary happiness and ultimate benefit to living beings. The next verse expresses the seventh branch of worship, dedication: Whatever merit I have accumulated, however slight, From obeisance, offering, confession, Rejoicing, imploring, and supplication-I dedicate it all to enlightenment. Dedication refers to never exhausting any of the roots of virtue-which are illustrated by the above six branches of worship-because you have dedicated them with strong aspiration as causes of com-plete enlightenment for yourself and all living beings. While understanding the meaning of the words of these verses in this way, slowly recite them as indicated without distraction. [59] Once you do this, you will have an immeasurable mass of merit. You accumulate the collections of merit and sublime wisdom-the favorable conditions-through performing the five branches of obeisance, offering, rejoicing, imploring, and supplication. Through confession you clear away the obscurations, which are the unfavor-able conditions. Cultivating delight in the virtue that you have done-which is part of rejoicing-will also increase your virtue. You may have few virtues as a result of accumulation, purification, and"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 99 increase, but you will expand them enormously through dedica-tion. Although virtuous effects may arise temporarily and then dis-sipate, through dedication they will never dissipate. To summarize, the seven branches of worship are included in the following three: accumulation, purification, and bringing about an expansion and a lack of dissipation. (6)161 Then, once you have pictured in your mind the objects of the ma1)<;iala and have offered the ma1)<;iala, make the following supplication many times with strong aspiration:162 Please bless all living beings-my mothers-and myself so that we may quickly stop all flawed states of mind, beginning with not respecting the teacher and ending with conceiving signs of true existence in the two kinds of self. Please bless us so that we may easily produce all flawless states of mind, beginning with respecting the teacher and ending with knowing the reality of selflessness. Please bless us to quell all inner and outer obstacles. b) Actual session i) How to sustain the meditation in general That which is known as \"meditation\" is the act of sustaining an object of meditation and specific subjective aspects163 by repeatedly focusing your mind upon a virtuous object of meditation. The pur-pose of this is as follows. From beginningless time you have been under the control of your mind; your mind has not been under your control. Furthermore, your mind tended to be obscured by the af-flictions and so forth. Thus, meditation aims to bring this mind, which gives rise to all faults and flaws, under control and then it aims to make it serviceable. Serviceability means that you can direct your mind as you wish toward a virtuous object of meditation. You might try to sustain your meditation by jumping to this and that object of meditation. [60] You may consider setting up accord-ing to your wish a variety of virtuous objects of meditation in no specific order. Though you may do this, you will not be able to take up your object of meditation with this method. Consequently, you will greatly hinder your mind's ability to be directed as you wish toward a virtuous object of meditation. If you have made this a habit from the start, the virtuous practice of your whole lifetime will be flawed. Therefore, from the beginning, firmly determine the definite or-der and enumeration of whatever objects of meditation you wish"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"100 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to sustain. Then, strengthen your will by repeatedly thinking, \"1 will not set up something that is different from what I have determined.\" Without exceeding or falling short of what you have determined, sustain your meditation with mindfulness and vigilance. ii) How to sustain the meditation specifically First reflect on the benefits of relying on the teacher, such as quickly attaining buddhahood, and the drawbacks of not relying on the teacher, such as giving rise to suffering in this and future lives. Then, think, many times and with an attitude of restraint, \"1 will never allow myself to conceive of faults in my guru.\" After considering any of your guru's good qualities that you know-such as ethical discipline, concentration, wisdom, and being learned-meditate on them until you produce a faith that has the aspect of mental clarity. Then, in accordance with the sl1tras cited earlier, contemplate how your guru's kindness has been and will be helpful to you. Medi-tate on that until you develop respect from the depths of your heart. c) What to do at the conclusion By means of such prayers as the Prayer of Samantabhadra and Aspi-ration in Seventy Verses (Praflidhtma-saptati),164 dedicate the virtue that you have accumulated. Do it with an aspiration so strong that it will be the cause of fulfilling your provisional and final aims. Medi-tate in this way during four sessions: predawn, morning, afternoon, and at nightfall. Furthermore, if at first you meditate for a long time, you will be readily susceptible to laxity and excitement. If this becomes your habit, it will then be difficult to correct your awareness. Therefore, meditate in many short sessions. If you end your session while still wanting to meditate, you will be eager to reenter each future ses-sion. [61] Otherwise, it is said that you will feel nauseous when you see the cushion. When your meditation has become somewhat stable, lengthen the session. In all the sessions make your practice free from the faults of being either too strict or excessively relaxed, and thereby sus-tain your meditation. In this way you will have few obstacles and will overcome problems such as overtiredness, laxity, and lethargy. 2) What to do in between meditation sessions165 In general there are many things to be done between meditation sessions, such as obeisance, circumambulation, and recitation [of"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 101 prayers and scripture]. However, the principal thing to do in this context is as follows. After you have made an effort to meditate in the actual session and are at the point of ending the session, you might not continue to rely on mindfulness and vigilance, and might instead completely let go of what should be sustained-the object of meditation and its subjective aspects. If you do so, your progress will be extremely small. Therefore, even in between sessions, look at teachings that reveal the meaning of your object of meditation, and recollect it again and again. Accumulate, by many means, the collections, which are favorable conditions for producing good qualities. Also, clear away, by many means, the obscurations, which are unfavorable conditions. By applying what you know, strive at whatever vow you have prom-ised to observe, as this is the basis of everything. In addition, follow the instruction called \"Consolidation\" with regard to (1) training the mind in the object of meditation and its subjective aspects, (2) ob-serving vows, and (3) accumulating the collections. Furthermore, learn the four preconditions, which are causes that readily produce the paths of serenity and insight: (a) restraining the sensory faculties, (b) acting vigilantly, (c) appropriate diet, and (d) striving to practice without sleeping at the wrong time, and acting properly at the time of sleep. a) Restraining the sensory faculties There are five parts to this section, the first of which is that with which you restrain the sensory faculties. You restrain them with a constant maintenance of your mindfulness and a continuous persistence at mindfulness. With respect to these two, the first, maintaining your mindfulness, means that you practice your mindfulness repeatedly without forgetting the teachings about restraining the sensory fac-ulties as well as the other three preconditions. The second, continu-ously persisting at mindfulness, means that you practice your mind-fulness continuously and with respect. What you are restraining is the six sensory faculties. What you are restraining them from is the six attractive and six unattractive sensory objects.166 How to restrain the sensory faculties has two parts, and they are as follows: 1) Guarding the sensory faculties: [62] After the six con-sciousnesses arise based upon their sensory objects and fac-ulties, the mental consciousness produces attachment for the six attractive sensory objects or hostility toward the six"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"102 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path unattractive ones. \"Guarding the sensory faculties\" means protecting your mind against such attachment and hostility, and making a great effort not to produce them. 2) Practicing restraint with the six sensory faculties is actu-ally stopping the sensory faculties. For instance, you don't let them engage those sensory objects that will produce afflictions when, for instance, looked at. Furthermore, \"guarding the sensory faculties\" means neither to take note of the six sensory objects nor to imagine them, and to achieve this through restraint, even when a sinful attitude such as attachment arises due to forgetfulness and an abundance of afflic-tions. \"Take note of\" refers to perceiving and paying attention to the intentional or unintentional appearance of sensory objects such as forms that you should not look at. \"Imagining\" can refer to the men-tal consciousness's apprehension of sensory objects that produce at-tachment, hostility, and ignorance, after the six consciousnesses have perceived them. It can also refer to hearing about these sensory ob-jects from others and then imagining them despite never having per-ceived them. Restraining means protecting the mind from being afflicted, and then setting it on something that is ethically neutral or virtuous. Here, the time for setting the mind on something that is \"unobscured and ethi-cally neutral\" is not when the mind is apprehending a virtuous object of meditation, but at other times, such as during physical activities. b) Acting with vigilance i) The foundations upon which you act This section has two parts: the five actions of movement, and the five actions of activity in a temple. The five actions of movement are: (1) actions of the body: going out to other places, like towns and temples, and returning from them; (2) actions of the eyes: both slightly looking at various objects because you have seen them unintentionally, and fully viewing those objects you have intentionally looked at; (3) actions of the limbs,fingers, and toes: stretching out and con-tracting the limbs, fingers, and toes; (4) actions of religious robes and alms bowls: [63] handling and making use of the three kinds of religious robes and the alms bowl; and (5) actions related to alms: eating, drinking, and so on."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 103 The five actions of activity in a temple are: (1) actions of the body: walking in a designated area; going to one who is in accord with the teaching; entering a passage-way for the sake of receiving the teaching; standing in the presence of those whom you are going to see and who are in accord with the teaching-the abbot, master, guru, and the like; or sitting in the full lotus posture upon a seat, and so on; (2) actions of speech: receiving the oral transmission of the twelve branches of scripture on which you have not pre-viously received oral transmission; understanding all of these; reciting that which you have received; teaching them to others; and conversing with others in order to encour-age their joyous perseverance; (3) actions of mind: sleeping in the middle period of the night; retiring to a quiet place and then not speaking while you think over the meaning of what you have heard, practice concentration by means of the nine mental states, and strive for insight; and, when feeling fatigued during hot weather, doing something to dispel your desire to fall asleep at an improper time; and (4) actions of day and (5) actions of night: both of these refer to not sleeping in the daytime or in the first and last periods of the night. These also refer to physical and verbal actions. Furthermore, the above statement \"Sleeping in the middle period of the night\" refers only to actions of night and ac-tions of mind. ii) Acting vigilantly with respect to the foundations Acting vigilantly with respect to the above-mentioned ten founda-tions is as follows. When you begin either movement or activity, right from the outset act conscientiously and establish mindfulness with respect to that action. Imbued with both of these, analyze the elements of the situation and analyze how you should proceed; then think about and arrive at an understanding of the situation in light of what you have concluded. In this regard, there are four elements: 1) The element of basis: With respect to any of the ten foun-dations-those of the actions of body, and so on-you should analyze what will be happening and how to proceed, and then consider the situation in light of what you have concluded."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"104 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path [64J For example, with respect to actions of going out and re-turning, understand the manner of going and coming as it is taught in the texts on discipline. Then reflect while going and coming, \"Now I am doing this and now this.\" 2) The element of direction: With regards to directions, you analyze to discover what will be happening and how to pro-ceed, and then consider the situation in light of what you have concluded. For instance, when going out, do not go to the five places-one that sells liquor, and so on.167 Having understood that you should go to places other than those, be vigilant with regard to this when you go out. 3) The element of time: With regards to any period of time, you analyze to discover what will be happening and how to proceed, and then consider the situation in light of what you have concluded. For example, once you have understood that it is proper to go to town in the morning but not in the after-noon, act accordingly and be vigilant at that time. 4) The element of actions: no matter how many actions you undertake, you analyze to discover what will be happening and how to proceed, and then consider the situation in light of what you have concluded. For example, when you go out, keep in mind any precepts there may be on going out, such as \"Go to another domicile in a very restrained manner.\" In short, be mindful of whatever behaviors may take place in the night or day. Then understand which are to be done and which not to be done. Whenever engaging in those which are to be done or turning away from those which are not to be done, be vigilant, and think, \"Now I am engaging in or turning away from this, and now this.\" If you do this, it is said that you will not be tarnished by in-fractions in this lifetime; even after death, you will not fall into the miserable realms; and you will have the preconditions for attain-ing knowledge of the paths that you have not yet attained. I have arranged both this section on acting vigilantly and the sec-tion on restraining the sensory faculties in accordance with the noble being Asanga's citations of sutras and the subsequent commentar-ies on the meaning of those citations. Work on these practices, for it is said that if you do, you will have unusual success in all your virtu-ous practices; in particular, your ethical discipline will be completely pure; and you will easily attain the nondiscursive states of concen-tration that comprise meditative serenity and insight. [65J"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 105 c) Appropriate diet An appropriate diet has four attributes: 1) Not eating too little: If you eat too little food, you will be hungry and will become weak, leaving no strength for virtu-ous activities. Therefore, \"not eating too little\" means that you must eat just the amount that will allow you not to be afflicted by hunger until tomorrow's meal. 2) Not eating too much: This is because if you eat too much, your body will be heavy, as if you were carrying a burden. It will be hard to breathe in and out. Sleepiness and lethargy will increase. You will be unfit for any action, so you will have no strength for eliminating the afflictions. 3) Eating digestible and wholesome food: With such food you eliminate old feelings of suffering related to food and you do not create new ones. 4) Eating appropriate food which does not produce afflictions: With such food you do not create misdeeds, and you stay happy. Moreover, the remedy for craving food lies within meditating on the faults of food. There are three faults: (1) The fault that arises from the causes of enjoyment: Contemplate how any colorful, aromatic, and good-tasting food whatsoever appears like vomit once you have chewed it and moistened it with your saliva. (2) The fault that arises from digesting food: Contemplate how food produces such elements of the body as flesh and blood after it is digested in the middle or last period of the night. Contemplate how some food becomes fe-ces and urine, and then remains in the lower part of the body; moreover, each day you have to excrete that. Think how many kinds of illnesses develop in connection with this food. (3) The five faults that come from looking for food: The five are as follows: 1) The fault of procurement: While being tormented by heat and cold, you must make great effort in order to procure food and assemble its causes. If you do not procure it, you suffer sorrow and the like. Even if you do procure the food, you fear that it will be stolen or wasted, and then suffer because of tak-ing great pains to guard it. 2) The fault of ruining close relationships: Even close relatives, such as fathers and sons, will dispute and fight with one an-other for the sake of food. [66]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"106 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 3) The fault of insatiability: Kings and the like will go to war with each other and experience much suffering when their craving for food intensifies. 4) The fault of the lack of independence: Those who eat others' food experience much suffering when they fight with oppo-nents on behalf of their leader. 5) The fault that arises from wrongdoing: Having amassed sins of body, speech, and mind for the sake of food and its causes, you remember your sins when you are dying, and die with regret. Moreover, after death, you fall into a miserable realm. Despite all of this, there is some benefit to food-after all, the body depends upon it. Eat your food after you think, \"Since it is not correct to rely on food just for the sake of my body's mainte-nance, I will conduct myself in a pure manner in dependence on my body's maintenance. Benefactors and those who actually carry out acts of charity work so hard that their skin, flesh, and blood dry up! Then they make their gifts with a wish for a special result. I will ensure that their actions have great effects.\" Remember as well that Santideva's Compendium of Trainings says168 to eat while reflect-ing that (1) you are benefiting the giver; (2) whereas now you are assembling micro-organisms in your body through the material gift of food, in the future you will gather these beings together through the teachings; and (3) you will accomplish the welfare of all living beings. Also Nagarjuna's Friendly Letter (Suhrl-Iekha) states:169 With an understanding that food is like medicine, Eat it without hostility or attachment; Not for haughtiness, might, Or robustness, but only to maintain your body. d) How to practice diligently without sleeping at the wrong time and how to act properly at the time of sleep The Friendly Letter:17o a Reasonable One, after cultivating virtue all day And in the first and last periods of the night as well, Sleep between these periods with mindfulness, Not wasting even the time of sleep. \"All day\" and \"the first and last periods of the night\" both refer to what should be done during and between meditation sessions. [67] Therefore, while sitting or standing, act purposefully, as I have ex-plained before, by completely clearing your mind of the five obscurations.l7l"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Meditation Session 107 There are teachings both for meditation sessions and for between meditation sessions with regard to restraining the sensory faculties and acting vigilantly, as well as this section on making effort to prac-tice instead of sleeping. Therefore, here I have singled out those teach-ings for between sessions. Your conduct during sleep takes place between sessions, so do not treat even that as having no purpose. How should you sleep? During the day and in the first of the three portions of the night, spend your time doing virtuous activi-ties; then sleep when the middle portion arrives. For, by sleeping you will enhance those elements of the body which are benefited by sleep. When you develop the body in that way, your body will be most serviceable for employment in both kinds of joyous perse-verance172 in the group of virtues, and this also will be helpful. When you go to sleep, first come out from the meditation room, wash your feet, and then enter your own room. Then, lying on your right side, place your left leg upon the right, and sleep like a lion. As for sleeping like a lion, among all animals it is the lion who uses superior capacity, confidence, and fortitude to subdue its oppo-nents. Likewise, one who joyously perseveres at practice instead of sleeping will use superior capacity, etc. to subdue opponents and will, at rest, sleep like a lion. This is unlike the sleep of hungry ghosts, deities, or those who are involved in desire, for they all have laziness, weak perseverance, and little capacity to subdue oppo-nents.173 From another point of view sleeping on your right side like a lion means that your body naturally does not become limp. Even when you have fallen asleep, you do not lose your mindfulness. Your sleep does not become heavy. You do not have bad or sinful dreams. But if you should sleep in some other way, all the faults that are the opposite of these four will arise. There are four kinds of thoughts with which to fall asleep: (1) The idea of illumination: First apprehend an image of light, and then sleep while imagining light. [68] Thereby, when you fall asleep, darkness will not arise in your mind. (2) Mindfulness: This arises from having heard, thought, and meditated on meaningful, virtu-ous teachings. Pursue this practice until you have fallen asleep. By this means, even when you are asleep, your mind will continue to engage the teachings, just as though you were not asleep. In short, you will sustain your virtuous practice even when you are asleep. (3) Vigilance: While you cultivate mindfulness in this way, any of the afflictions could arise. If any of them does, you notice it and eliminate it rather than acquiesce to it. (4) The idea of rising: This has"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"108 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path three aspects. First, do not let the mind slip into a state of being com-pletely overwhelmed by sleep. Instead, sleep very lightly like a deer, with a mind imbued with joyous perseverance. This will prevent heavy sleep, and you will be able to awaken without oversleeping. Second, think, \"Ah, I will always practice staying awake174 as the Buddha taught,\" and then with great effort develop an aspiration to this end. With this, your sleep will not deviate from the sleep of a lion, which the Buddha permitted. Third, think, \"Just as I joyously persevered at cultivating virtue and not sleeping today, I will do the same tomorrow as well.\" This will prevent breaking the conti-nuity of your aspiration to cultivate virtue. Even if you forget your aspiration, always work to make it stronger. Conducting yourself in this way while eating and sleeping in-volves no misdeeds. Since acting purposefully in this manner will clearly stop you from wasting so much of your life, I have explained it as the noble Asanga, citing sfltra, determined it to be. Everything that I have said here about how to act before, during, after, and between sessions applies to all of the meditations described from here through and including the section on insight. [69] The only exceptions are the distinctive meditative procedures during the actual sessions. This concludes the explanation of what to do in between sessions."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"6 REFUTING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT MEDITATION There are persons who have not begun to recognize that the classic scriptures and their commentaries constitute personal instructions, and who, therefore, might have the following qualm. Qualm: When you meditate on the path, you should do only sta-bilizing meditation rather than repeatedly analyzing your object of meditation, for repeated analysis with discerning wisdom is only for times of study and reflection. Moreover, repeated analysis will prevent you from future attainment of buddhahood because con-ceptual thought apprehends signs of true existence. Reply: This is the nonsensical chatter of someone who is utterly ignorant of the crucial points of practice, for Maitreya's Ornament for the Mahayana Sl1tras states:175 Proper attention is based upon prior study. Sublime wisdom, which takes reality as its object, arises from your cultivation of proper attention. Here Maitreya teaches that you should use the wisdom that comes from reflection to attend properly to the meaning of what you have studied. From this there will arise the wisdom that comes from meditation and perceives reality. Therefore, first study with someone what you intend to practice, and come to know it secondhand. Next, use scripture and reason-ing to properly reflect on the meaning of what you have studied, coming to know it firsthand. Once you determine the meaning of what you originally intended to practice with this kind of study"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"110 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path and reflection and you have no doubts, then familiarize yourself with it repeatedly. We call this repeated familiarization \"medita-tion.\" Thus, you need both repeated analytical meditation and nonanalytical stabilizing meditation, because meditation involves both nonanalytical stabilization on the meaning of what you origi-nally intended to practice that was determined through study and reflection and the use of discerning wisdom to analyze this mean-ing. Therefore, to claim that all meditations are stabilizing medita-tions is like taking one grain of barley and saying, \"This is all the barley grains there are.\" [70] Moreover, just as study must precede the wisdom that comes from study, and reflection must precede the wisdom that comes from reflection, so too meditation must precede the wisdom that comes from meditation. As this is so, meditation means becoming familiar with what you have ascertained using the wisdom that comes from reflection. Therefore, it is said that the wisdom that comes from meditation is a product of the wisdom that comes from reflection. Thus, the depth of the wisdom that comes from your studies is commensurate with your studies. The breadth of your reflection is commensurate with this wisdom, while the depth of the wisdom that comes from your reflections is proportionate to your reflections. The magnitude of your practice of meditation corresponds to the depth of your wisdom of reflection, while your ability to stop faults and achieve good qualities is commensurate with your practice of meditation. Therefore, the scriptures and their commentaries say that study and reflection are very important for the practice of meditation. Objection: What is determined through study and reflection is not intended for meditation, but is merely for promoting superficial knowledge and eliminating others' misconceptions. Therefore, when you meditate, you must meditate on something unrelated to your study and reflection. Response: This is incoherent, like showing a horse one racecourse and then racing it on another. This completely destroys the process of developing the three wisdoms176 in succession, which is what the scriptures, as a whole, present. This also implies the nonsensical statement, \"Much study is not needed to travel the true path.\" One indication of a failure to recognize these critical points is in not distinguishing in the beginning between those who are well-trained in the so.tras or tantras and those who have no training at"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Refuting Misconceptions about Meditation 111 all, and then not assigning the appropriate amount of practice. An-other such indication is that meditators are criticized if they study or do research. These mistaken customs persist in Tibet. [71] While mere familiarization with knowledge acquired through the wisdom of study and reflection is indeed not a good quality that results from meditation, how could this contradict familiarization as simply being equivalent to meditation? If it did, then medita-tion would never be possible for an ordinary being who had not attained access to the first meditative stabilization.177 For, the texts on knowledge often explain that the process of entering a higher level from the level of the desire realm creates a good quality that results from meditation, but there is no such result of meditation [creation of a good quality] associated with the desire realm itself.178 Therefore, understand \"meditation\" as it is explained in Dharmamitra's Clear Words Commentary (Prasphuta-pada):179 \"Meditating\" is making the mind take on the state or condition of the object of meditation. For example, \"meditating on compassion\" and \"meditating on faith\" mean that the mind must be made to develop these qualities. Because of this, even the great translators sometimes use the term \"path of medi-tation,\" and at other times use the term\" conditioning,\" as in the phrase from Maitreya's Ornament for Clear Knowledge,180 \"the paths of seeing and conditioning.\" Conditioning and meditation are synonymous. Furthermore, Venerable Maitreya says:181 As for the branch of certain differentiation,182 The path of seeing, and the path of meditation, It is repeated reflection, comprehension, and definite discern-ment That constitute the path of meditation. Maitreya says that repeated reflection, comprehension, and defi-nite discernment constitute the path of meditation for a Mahayana noble being. In light of this, it is ridiculous to claim that meditation and sustained analysis are contradictory. Furthermore, there is no end to statements which explain that the purpose of sustained and repeated analysis is meditation. For instance, there are references to \"meditating on faith,\" \"meditat-ing on the four immeasurables and the spirit of enlightenment,\" and \"meditating on impermanence and suffering.\" Santideva in his Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds and Compendium of Trainings states,I83 \"I compose this in order to condition my own mind.\" In"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"112 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path this way, he says that all the stages of the path that he explains in these two texts are meditation. [72] Further, the Compendium ofTrain-ings says,184 \"Therefore, meditate continuously on any distribution, protection, purification, or enhancement of your body, resources, or merit.\" This indicates that meditation includes any performance of the four practices of distributing, protecting, purifying, and en-hancing with regard to your body, resources, or roots of virtue. With this in mind, do not take \"meditation\" to be very limited. Moreover, to claim that all conceptual thought involves the ap-prehension of signs of true existence, and thus prevents enlighten-ment, is the worst possible misconception insofar as it disregards all discerning meditation. This is the system of the Chinese abbot Ha-shang. I explain its refutation in the section on serenity and in-sight. This misconception also interferes with the development of deep respect for the classic texts, because these texts are mainly concerned only with the need to use discerning analysis, whereas Ha-shang's system sees all analysis as unnecessary during practice. This is also a major cause of the teaching's decline, because those who have this misconception do not recognize the classic scriptures and their commentaries to be instructions and therefore belittle their value. Question: If, as you say, there are two types of meditation-ana-lytical meditation and nonanalytical stabilizing meditation-what kind of practice involves analytical meditation and what kind in-volves stabilizing meditation? Reply: I will explain this. Analytical meditation is necessary for meditations such as those on faith in the teacher; the great impor-tance and difficulty in obtaining leisure and opportunity; death and impermanence; karma and its effects; the faults of cyclic existence; and the spirit of enlightenment. This is because these meditations need an awareness that is long-lasting, very forceful, and capable of changing the mind. Without this, you will not be able to stop the forces that oppose these meditations, such as disrespect. Furthermore, the development of such a powerful awareness solely depends upon repeated meditation with discerning analy-sis. [73] For example, when you mistakenly superimpose many at-tractive characteristics upon the object of your attachment, you pro-duce intense attachment. Similarly, when you think often about the unattractive characteristics of your enemy, you produce intense hatred. It is the same in the case of any meditation on any of these types of practices [death and impermanence, karma and its effects,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Refuting Misconceptions about Meditation 113 etc.], regardless of whether the image of the meditative object is clear. Therefore, practice analytical meditation, because your mind requires a long-lasting and very forceful way to apprehend its objects. When you achieve stabilizing meditations such as meditative serenity, you create a serviceability that allows you to place your mind on one object of meditation according to your wish. If those whose minds cannot stay on one object of meditation analyze re-peatedly while they are trying to achieve a stabilizing meditation, they will be unable to produce mental stability. Hence, in this case they should practice stabilizing meditation. I will explain this later in the section on meditative serenity and insight. Not knowing this system, some even propound, \"If you are a scholar, you only do analytical meditation. Adepts only do stabi-lizing meditation.\" This is not the case, because each must do both. The scholar must achieve stabilizing meditations such as medita-tive serenity, while the adept must pursue such practices as intense faith in the teacher. Furthermore, both the slltra section of scrip-ture and the tantra section of scripture very frequently say that you must use discernment for both of these methods of meditation. If you lack or are deficient in such analytical meditation, then you will not develop stainless wisdom, the precious life of the path. Even if you develop a little wisdom, it will not be increased greatly. There-fore, you will not quickly progress along the path, because the ul-timate object that you achieve on the path is the wisdom that dif-ferentiates, comprehensively and without confusion, the real nature and diversity of phenomena. As the master Maqceta states, \" ... om-niscience is best amongst wisdoms.\" Consequently, understand it as a definite sign of having taken the wrong path if no matter how much you cultivate the path, your mindfulness is dulled by oblivi-ousness and you are slow-witted about what to eliminate and what to adopt. Furthermore, by using discerning wisdom to conduct analytical meditation on the meaning of the scriptures, you understand the many attributes of the good qualities of the three jewels and the like, and you then greatly increase the faith associated with these attributes, etc. [74] Also, once you have used analytical meditation to comprehend the many faults of cyclic existence, you develop great disgust for and disenchantment with cyclic existence, and you then see the benefits of liberation from many perspectives. So you then diligently seek liberation. Using this meditation, you even fathom the spirit of enlightenment and the many wondrous activities of the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"114 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path six perfections and so forth. This greatly increases your irrevers-ible faith, aspiration, and joyous perseverance. As all of this is based exclusively on the use of discerning wisdom in order to conduct analytical meditation on the meaning of the scriptures, the intelli-gent should in this manner bring about such certainty that others cannot sway them away from it. Those with a very small understanding of how to meditate might say the following: Qualm: If you do too much analysis with discernment and sus-tain that in meditation, you will hinder your concentration, which is one-pointed upon a single object of meditation. So you will not achieve firm concentration. Reply: I will explain this. Concentration allows you to willfully fix your attention on any single object of meditation. If you have not already achieved such concentration, then this concentration will not develop if you attempt to achieve it for the first time while analyzing many objects. Therefore, simply do stabilizing medita-tion to achieve concentration until you attain it. If this is what you mean by your qualm, then I agree. However, you might assert that if you do too much analytical meditation prior to achieving concentration, you hinder your con-centration. If this is the case, then it is clear that you do not under-stand the way to achieve concentration as it is explained in the com-mentaries of the great trailblazers. For example, when a skilled smith repeatedly bums gold and silver in a fire and repeatedly washes them in water, they are purified of all their defilements and residues. The gold and the silver then become very soft and pli-able. Hence, they are ready to be transformed into whatever orna-ments you want, such as earrings. [75] Likewise, you initially use your discerning wisdom to meditate repeatedly on faults, such as the afflictions, the secondary afflictions, karmic effects of wrongdoing, and the faults of cyclic existence, ac-cording to their order in scripture. This makes you completely dis-pleased or disenchanted. By bringing this to mind, you tum away from the group of nonvirtuous things and clear away these defile-ments, like burning gold in fire. Next, you use your discerning wisdom to meditate repeatedly on good qualities, such as the good qualities of the teacher, the great importance of leisure and oppor-tunity, good qualities of the three jewels, virtuous karma and its effects, and the benefits of the spirit of enlightenment, again accord-ing to their order in scripture. This causes the mind to become"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Refuting Misconceptions about Meditation 115 \"moist\"l85 or clear. Like washing gold in water, bringing this to mind directs the mind toward the virtuous group of phenomena, causes delight, and then moistens the mind with virtues. Once this hap-pens, focus your mind on what you want to achieve-either medi-tative serenity or insight-and you will accomplish it without dif-ficulty. Therefore, such analytical meditation is the superior method for achieving non discursive concentration. In the same way, the noble being Asati.ga says:186 For example, in order for smiths or their skilled apprentices to purify silver or gold of all defilements and impurities, they burn it in fire and wash it in water. By doing this, they understand that they can make it into this or that ornament by way of its service-ability and pliability. Then those who know the appropriate craft-the smiths and their skilled apprentices-use the smiths' tools to transform the metal into whatever kind of ornament they want. Likewise, yogis and yoginis become disenchanted by simply not turning their mind toward any impurities or defilements such as covetousness. They create delight simply by not turning toward the unhappiness of the afflicted mind and by being inclined to-ward joy in the group of virtues. [76] When they do this, their minds become linked to and calmly settled upon-without fluc-tuation or movement-any object to which they apply them within the scope of serenity or insight. They then can use their minds to properly attain whatever objective for which they aim. Laxity and excitement are the two principal conditions that are unfavorable for attaining a concentration wherein the mind stead-fastly stays upon one object of meditation. With respect to this, if you have a very forceful and long-lasting aW:lreness of the good qualities of the three jewels and the like, you will easily eliminate laxity. Many authorities state that the remedy for laxity is uplifting the mind by means of seeing good qualities. Likewise, if you have a very forceful and long-lasting awareness of the faults of imper-manence, suffering, and the like, you will easily eliminate excite-ment. Many scriptures say that disenchantment is praised as the remedy for excitement because excitement is a mental distraction involving attachment. Therefore, you will easily attain the firm concentrations which please the learned to a degree commensurate with your cultivation of the trainings, beginning with faith in the teacher and ending with the engaged spirit of enlightenment.

Because of this, the knowledgeable gurus of the lineage that handed down these personal instructions conveyed a clear understanding of what-ever object of meditation they transmitted. In order to do this, they first thought over the meaning of the appropriate passages from both the sl1tras and the commentaries in light of their guru's per-sonal instructions. Enriching their presentation with the sayings of former gurus, they comprehensively explained the topic of medi-tation. They also said that success is more difficult for those who contemplate on their own than for those who transform their minds in a classroom, where those who know how to explain the teach-ings do so for those who know how to listen. This statement is ex-cellent and true. [77J Therefore, it is improper to say, \"Now is the time for meditation,\" and then solely do a little meditation, for the saying \"a time for study and reflection and a time for practice\" expresses the misconception that extensive explanation of the teach-ings is not compatible with the context of practice. However, those who know how to bring all these explanations into practice seem barely to exist at all. Therefore, you should also create another concise presentation of what to sustain in meditation. Whether you understand that all of the scriptures are personal instructions follows only from whether you know this meditative process. Even those who have trained for a long time in the classic texts of the sl1tra and mantra vehicles may, when meditating on the path, interpret texts in which they have trained to support miscon-ceptions such as the ones mentioned above. What need is there to mention those who have not trained in the scriptural collections? Therefore, there is a need to establish this in a more detailed manner. Nevertheless, fearing verbosity, I have not written more than just this.

An exhortation to take full advantage of a life of leisure and opportunity (Chapter 7) 2. How to take full advantage of a life of leisure and oppor-tunity (Chapters 8 and on)"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"118 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 1. An exhortation to take full advantage of a life of leisure and opportunity Taking full advantage of a life of leisure and opportunity is ex-plained in terms of three aspects: identifying leisure and opportu-nity; contemplating its great importance; and contemplating the difficulty of attaining it. a. The identification of leisure and opportunity 1) Leisure The Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines says:187 Through ethical discipline you eliminate The eight conditions that lack leisure And many circumstances in a life as an animal. Through it, you always attain leisure. According to this, leisure means freedom from a rebirth in any of the eight conditions that lack leisure. These eight conditions are stated in the Friendly Letter:188 To be reborn with wrong views or without a conqueror's word, Or as an animal, a hungry ghost, a hell-being, An uncultured person in a border region, A stupid and mute person, or a deity of long life [78] Is to be afflicted by one of the eight faults that are conditions which lack leisure. After you have attained leisure, which is freedom from these, Strive to end birth. With three of these eight you are unable to know what to adopt and what to cast aside: being reborn in a border region in which the four types of followers [fully ordained monks and nuns and novice monks and nuns] are not active; being mute, stupid, and having incomplete sensory faculties-which means incomplete limbs, ears, and so on; and lacking a conqueror's word, meaning born where a buddha has not arisen. If you have a wrong view which miscon-ceives the three jewels, karma and its effects, and former and fu-ture lives as nonexistent, you do not believe in the sublime teach-ings. You will have great difficulty in developing a religious attitude if you are born in any of the three miserable realms, and, even if you do develop a little bit, you will be unable to practice because you will be tormented by suffering. Mahamati's Clear Words: Explanation of the \"Friendly Letter\" (Vyakta-pada-suhrl-Iekha-fika) explains189 that a deity of long life is"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"A Human Life of Leisure and Opportunity 119 one who lacks discrimination and lives in the formless realm. Asvaghoi?a's A Talk on the Eight Conditions that Lack Leisure (A?tak?a/Ja-katha) explains190 that a deity of long life is one in the desire realm who is constantly distracted by activities of desire. Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge states that the deities who lack discrimination exist in one area of Great Fruit-a land of the fourth meditative stabilization. This area is set off from the rest of Great Fruit in the way that a monastery is set off from a lay settlement.191 Even more, these deities have inactive minds and mental pro-cesses, except for the time immediately following birth and dur-ing death. Finally, they live for many great eons. It is incorrect to say that a noble being who exists in the formless realm is in a con-dition that lacks leisure. Therefore, we say that ordinary beings who are born in the formless realm are in a condition that lacks leisure because they do not have the opportunity to achieve the path to liberation. The same can also be said for being reborn as a deity of the desire realm who is constantly distracted by sensual pleasures.192 Thus, with respect to calling these\" conditions that lack leisure,\" the Clear Words: Explanation of the \"Friendly Letter\" states:193 In these eight states there is no time for acts of virtue; therefore, they are called \"conditions that lack leisure.\" 2) Opportunity a) The five aspects of opportunity that pertain to yourself According to the Sravaka Levels the five are:194 Being human, being born in a central region, having complete sensory faculties, Having reversible karma, and having faith in the source. [79] \"Being born in a central region\" means that you are born in an area wherein the four types of followers are active. \"Having complete sensory faculties\" means that you are not stupid or mute, and that you have your main limbs, secondary limbs, eyes, ears, and the like intact. \"Having reversible karma\" means that you have not done or caused others to commit the five deeds of immediate retribu-tion.195 \"Faith in the source\" means that you have faith in discipline, which is the root from which all mundane and supra mundane vir-tues arise. Here, \"discipline\" refers to all three scriptural collections. These five are called \"aspects of opportunity that pertain to your-self\" because they are included in your mind-stream and are favor-able conditions for practicing the teaching."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"120 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path b) The five aspects of opportunity that pertain to others The five are:196 That a buddha has visited, that the sublime teaching is being taught, That the teaching remains, that there are those who follow it, That there is caring for others. Among these, \"that a buddha has visited,\" (or is appearing), means that a bodhisattva has accumulated the collections of merit and sublime wisdom for three countless eons, and has reached the heart of enlightenment; i.e., become a perfect buddha. \"That the sublime teaching is being taught\" means that a buddha or the disciples of that buddha are imparting the teaching. \"That the teaching re-mains\" means that it is not degenerating between the time of some-one becoming a buddha and giving the teaching until this buddha passes into final nirvcll)a. Furthermore, this phrase refers to the teaching at the time its followers achieve it by knowing the ulti-mate sublime teachings. \"That there are those who follow\" this teaching means that there are some who understand that beings have the capacity to perceive the sublime teaching. They understand this through the very knowledge of the ultimate, sublime teachings mentioned above. These individuals then follow the teaching while teaching others according to their knowiedge. \"That there is car-ing for others\" refers to benefactors and those who actually carry out acts of charity by giving religious robes and the like. Since these five conditions exist in the minds of others and are favorable con-ditions for the practice of the teachings, they are called \"aspects of opportunity that pertain to others.\" The first four aspects of opportunity that pertain to others (as presented here from the Sravaka Levels)197 are at present incomplete for us. However, it is suitable to consider an approximation of three of these four-the sublime teaching being taught, the teachings given remaining, and there being followers of the teaching which abides-to be complete for us. [80] b. Contemplating the great importance of leisure and opportunity Until death, animals strive merely to avoid suffering and achieve hap-piness. Therefore, if you do this and do not practice the pure teach-ings for the sake of achieving lasting happiness, then you are like an animal despite being born in a happy realm. As Candragomin's Letter to a Student (Si?ya-Iekha) states:198"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"A Human Life of Leisure and Opportunity 121 Just as an elephant calf craves a few mouthfuls Of grass that grows at the edge of a deep pit and Falls into the chasm without obtaining any, So it is with those who desire the joys of this world. Not just any life will suffice for the practice of such pure teachings in general or for the practice of the Mahayana path in particular. Consequently, you must attain such a life as was described earlier. The Letter to a Student:199 With a human life you attain the spirit of enlightenment, Which is the basis for the path to the state of a sugata, Which brings great mental force, and which equips you to lead all beings. Neither nagas, demigods, vidyadharas, garudas, kinnaras,2Â°o nor snakes attain this path. Also the Descent into the Womb Sutra (Garbhavakranti-sl1tra) states:201 Even though you have been born a human with such limitless suffering, you still have the best of situations. It is difficult to at-tain this even in ten million eons. Even when the deities die, the other deities say, \"May you have a happy rebirth.\" By happy re-birth they mean a human rebirth. Thus, even the deities hold human life as something toward which they aspire. A life as a certain type of desire realm deity-one who has strong latent propensities due to previously having trained in the path as a human-can serve as a basis for initially seeing the truth. How-ever, you cannot initially attain the path of a noble being during a life in the higher [deities'] realms.202 Moreover, most desire realm deities are said to be in a condition that lacks leisure, as explained previously. Therefore, a human life is the supreme basis for initially achieving the path. Furthermore, since a human life on the Uttarakuru continent is not a suitable basis for vows, there is praise for a human life on the other three continents. Moreover, among these, there is praise for a human on Jambudvipa. Therefore, repeatedly meditate with thoughts such as this: Why would I waste this attainment of such a good life? When I act as though it were insignificant, I am deceiving myself. [81] What could be more foolish than this? Just this once I am free from continuously trekking the many narrow cliff-paths of leisureless conditions, such as miserable realms. If I waste this freedom and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"122 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path return to those conditions, it would be similar to losing my mind, like someone dazed by a magic spell. As Aryast1ra says:203 Human life plants the seed For going beyond cyclic existence, The supreme seed of glorious enlightenment. Human life is a stream of good qualities Better than a wish-granting jewel. Who here would attain it and then waste it? And also, Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds states:204 There is nothing more deluded And nothing more confused Than for me to have found such leisure And yet not to cultivate virtue. After I have recognized this, If I remain idle through confusion, Great sorrow will befall me At the time of my death. When my body roasts for a long time In the intolerable fires of hell, Blazing flames of unbearable regret Will certainly ravage my mind. This is a rare and helpful situation; Somehow I found it by chance. If despite my intelligence I am drawn again to hell, Then, like one bewildered by a magic spell, I will have simply lost my wits. What is it within me that causes this confusion? I do not know even this. Furthermore, Geshe Drom-don-ba asked Jen-nga, \"Are you mind-ful that you have a human life endowed with leisure and opportu-nity?\" Jen-nga replied, \"Each time I enter into meditation, I recite: Now I have independence and favorable conditions. If I do not take full advantage of this time, I will plunge into the abyss and fall under the control of others. Who will lift me out? [82] Thus, every time he meditated, Jen-nga first recited this verse of teaching, which is from Candrakirti's Commentary on the \"Middle Way\" (Madhyamaktlvatara).205 You should also do the same."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"A Human Life of Leisure and Opportunity 123 Contemplate the great importance of leisure and opportunity in this way with respect to your final goals. Also reflect on how im-portant they are in terms of your temporary goals. That is, consider how you can easily achieve with this life qualities such as generos-ity, ethical discipline, and patience, which are the causes of re-sources, perfect attendants, and the body of a being in high status [rebirth amongst humans or deities]. Think as follows: In this way, this life is very important in terms of attaining high status and certain goodness [of either liberation or omniscience]. If I were to waste it and not strive day and night to create the causes of these two goals, it would be as if I were returning empty-handed from a land of jewels. Also, I will be bereft of happiness in the future and will not obtain a life of leisure. Without leisure, I will undergo continual suffering. Thus, what kind of self-decep-tion is worse than this? As Aryasllra says:206 Those who have obtained a human life rich in virtues Through a collection of merit over innumerable eons, And who then, due to confusion in this life, Fail to accumulate even the slightest treasury of merit Will in future lifetimes Enter the house of unbearable sorrow. Like the traders who go to a land of jewels And return home empty-handed, Without the karmic paths of the ten virtues You will not obtain a human life again. How can there be happiness without a human life? Without happiness, there is only suffering. Therefore, you have only deceived yourself before going to the next life. There is nothing more confused than this. After thinking like this, develop a great desire to take full advan-tage of this life of leisure and opportunity. Engaging in the Bodhi-sattva Deeds:207 Once you have given this body wages and bonuses, You must make it act for your welfare. Do not give it everything If it does not help you. Also: Relying on the boat of a human body, Free yourself from the great river of suffering."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"124 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Because this boat is difficult to obtain again, Do not sleep now, fool! Furthermore, Bo-do-wa states in his Jewel Heaps of Teachings Through Analogy (dPe chos rin chen spungs pa): An insect's obeisance, a ride upon a wild ass, the Tsang (rTsang) person's fish, and buttered balls of roasted barley flour.20B By thinking along these lines, develop the desire to take full ad-vantage of a human life of leisure and opportunity. [83] c. Contemplating the difficulty of attaining leisure and opportunity Moreover, whether you start from a happy realm or a miserable realm, it is difficult to obtain such leisure and opportunity. For, the Buddha states in the Bases of Discipline (Vinaya-vastu)209 that those who die in the miserable realms and are reborn there are similar in number to the dust particles on the great earth, whereas those who are reborn from there into happy realms are similar in number to the dust particles on the tip of a fingernail. Further, those who die in both types of happy realms [human and divine] and are reborn in the miserable realms are similar in number to the dust particles on the great earth, while those who die in the happy realms and are reborn there are similar in number to the dust particles on the tip of a fingernail. Question: Why is a human life of leisure and opportunity so dif-ficult to obtain? Reply: It is because beings of the happy realms-humans and the like-are frequently involved in such ignoble activities as the ten nonvirtues. Because of this, they are reborn in the miserable realms. As Aryadeva's Four Hundred Stanzas states:210 Humans for the most part Are involved in things ignoble. Therefore, most ordinary beings Will surely go to the miserable realms. For instance, for even a single moment of anger toward a bodhi-sattva you must stay for an eon in the Unrelenting Hell. As this is so, it goes without saying that you will have to stay for many eons in the miserable realms on account of having in your mind-stream the imprints of many sins that you previously accumulated over many lifetimes. These imprints have not been erased by an antidote and have not yet issued effects. Still, if you completely clear away"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"A Human Life of Leisure and Opportunity 125 previously accumulated causes of miserable rebirths and restrain yourself from engaging in these causes again, you are assured of a happy rebirth. However, doing this is extremely rare. If you do not act this way, you will be reborn in a miserable realm. Once there, you will not cultivate virtue, but you will continually commit sins. You will not even hear the phrase \"happy realms\" for many eons! Therefore, a human life of leisure and opportunity is very difficult to obtain. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:211 With behavior such as mine I will not attain a human body again. If I do not attain it, I will commit sin and never be virtuous. [84] If I do not cultivate virtue Even when I have the chance to do so, What virtue will I cultivate in a miserable realm, Completely confused and suffering? If I cultivate no virtue And accumulate sins, I will not hear even the name \"Happy realms\" for a billion eons. Thus the Bhagavan said That this human life is as difficult to obtain As it is for a sea turtle to put its neck Into a yoke tossing about on the vast ocean. If even a single moment's wrongdoing Causes you to abide in the Unrelenting Hell for an eon, It goes without saying that you will not enter a happy realm Due to sins heaped up since beginningless time. Qualm: When I experience the suffering of the miserable realms, I will be extinguishing previous bad karma, and then I will be re-born in a happy realm. Hence, getting out of the miserable realms is not difficult. Reply: While you are experiencing the suffering in the miserable realms, you are constantly accumulating sins. Therefore, although you may die in a miserable realm, you will continue to be reborn in miserable realms. Because of this, getting out of the miserable realms is difficult. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:212 Experiencing only the effects of that karma, You will not get out-While experiencing the effects, You create other sins."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"126 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path After you have reflected on the difficulty of obtaining a human life of leisure and opportunity in this way, develop the desire to take full advantage of such a life. Think, \"If I use this life for wrongdo-ing, it is extremely wasteful. In light of this, I will spend my time practicing the sublime teaching.\" Nagarjuna's Friendly Letter states:213 Since it is even more difficult to obtain a human life from an animal life Than for a sea turtle's head to enter The aperture of a yoke floating upon the great ocean, o King, lord of humankind, make this life fruitful by practicing the sublime teaching. One who is born as a human, And then becomes involved in wrongdoing Is even more foolish than one who fills A golden vessel adorned with jewels with vomit. And Candragomin's Letter to a Student states:214 After you have obtained a human life, so difficult to obtain, Resolutely achieve just that which you seek. [85] Furthermore, the great yogFlS said to Jen-nga, liDo it a little at a time.\" Jen-nga replied, \"I understand this, but this leisure and op-portunity are difficult to obtain.\" Bo-do-wa said: In the region of Pen-bo ('Pan [po]) there was a great fortress named May-cha-kar (rMa'i-phyva-mkhar). It was captured by an enemy, and could not be recaptured for a long time. Consequently, there was this old man who was tormented by the loss of this for-tress. One time he heard someone cry, \"The fortress has been taken back,\" whereupon he grabbed a spear, being unable to walk, and, dragging himself along with the help of the spear, exclaimed, \"How nice it would be if recapture of the May-cha-kar fortress isn't a dream!\" Similarly, you must find such delight in the attainment of leisure and opportunity, and you must practice the teachings. Meditate until you attain the attitude indicated in these stories. In order to develop this sort of fully qualified desire to take full advantage of a life of leisure, you must reflect on its four elements, as follows: 1) the need to practice the teachings, because all living be-ings only want happiness and do not want suffering, and because achieving happiness and alleviating suffering depend only on practicing the teachings;"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"A Human Life of Leisure and Opportunity 127 2) the ability to practice, because you are endowed with the external condition, a teacher, and the internal conditions, leisure and opportunity; 3) the need to practice in this lifetime, because if you do not practice, it will be very difficult to obtain leisure and op-portunity again for many lifetimes; and 4) the need to practice right now, because there is no certainty when you will die. Among these, the third stops the laziness of giving up, which thinks, \"I will practice the teaching in future lives.\" The fourth stops the laziness of disengagement, which thinks, \"Although I should prac-tice in this lifetime, it is enough to practice later on and not to prac-tice in my early years, months, and days.\" Therefore, it is accept-able to create a list of three qualities by subsuming these two into one, \"practicing quickly.\" In this case, mindfulness of death is in-deed relevant here, but I will explain it later; otherwise this will become too wordy. If you reflect on this human life of leisure and opportunity from many perspectives, you will greatly affect your mind. Therefore, contemplate as instructed above. [86] If you cannot do this, condense this material into three topics: what the nature of leisure and op-portunity is, how it is important in terms of temporary and final goals, and how it is difficult to obtain in terms of its causes and ef-fects. Then take from the above explanations whatever accords with your mind, and meditate on it. With respect to how it is difficult to obtain a human life of lei-sure and opportunity in terms of the causes, consider the follow-ing. In general, even to obtain just a happy rebirth you must culti-vate a single pure virtue, such as ethical discipline. In particular, to obtain complete leisure and opportunity requires many roots of virtue, such as having a foundation of pure ethical discipline, aug-menting it with generosity and the like, and when dying making a connection with your next lifetime through stainless aspirational prayers. As this is so, it is obvious that very few achieve such causes. Therefore, once you have understood this, reflect on the difficulty of obtaining the general effect, a life in a happy realm, and the par-ticular effect, a human life with leisure and opportunity. The difficulty of obtaining a human life of leisure and opportu-nity in terms of the effects is explained as follows.

Why students are led in stages using the trainings of the three types of persons 1) How all the scriptures are included within the paths of the three types of persons In the beginning a person who is to become a buddha develops the spirit of enlightenment; in the middle, this person accumulates the collections of merit and sublime wisdom; and in the end, this per-son actualizes perfect buddhahood. All these actions are solely for the welfare of living beings. Therefore, all the teachings given by a buddha simply accomplish the welfare of living beings. This being the case, the welfare of living beings is what you should accom-plish as well. [87] This welfare is twofold: the provisional goal of high status as a human or deity, and the final goal of the certain goodness of liberation or omniscience. Between these two, many of the Buddha's statements pertain to the attainment of the tempo-rary goal of high status. All of these statements are included in the teachings for a person of genuine small capacity or the teachings shared with such a person, because persons of special small capac-ity do not work very much on behalf of this lifetime, but they dili-gently strive for the excellent high states of human or divine rebirth in future lifetimes by engaging in the cultivation of their causes. The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment:216 Know to be \"least\" those persons Who diligently strive to attain Solely the joys of cyclic existence By any means for their welfare alone. There are two kinds of certain goodness: the liberation that is mere freedom from cyclic existence and the sublime state of omni-science. Many of the Buddha's statements pertain to the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and the sravaka. All of these statements are in-cluded in the teachings for a person of actual medium capacity or the teachings shared with such a person, because persons of me-dium capacity develop disenchantment with all of cyclic existence, and then make their goal their own liberation from cyclic existence. They then enter the path of the three trainings, the method for at-taining liberation. The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment:217 Those persons are called \"medium\" Who stop sinful actions,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Three Types of Persons 131 Turn their backs on the joys of cyclic existence, And diligently strive just for their own peace. The Elder's [Atisha's] Lamp for the Collection of Deeds (Carya-sa1J1graha-pradipa) states:218 Since the guru, the Buddha, said, \"Depend on the perfection and mantra vehicles And attain enlightenment,\" Here I will write about the meaning of this. According to this, the method of attaining omniscience is twofold: the Mahayana of the perfections and the Mahayana of mantra. These two are included in the teachings of a person of great capac-ity because persons of great capacity, under the influence of great compassion, make buddhahood their goal in order to extinguish all the sufferings of all living beings. They then train in the six per-fections, the two stages, and the like. [88] The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment:219 Those persons are called \"superior\" Who sincerely want to extinguish All the sufferings of others By understanding their own suffering. Below, I will explain how the method for these persons to attain enlightenment involves both the perfection and mantra vehicles. With respect to the terms for the three types of persons, these statements in the Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment are similar in meaning to the statement in the Compendium of Determinations (Viniscaya-samgrahalJi) of the Levels of Yogic Deeds (Yoga-carya-bhami):22o Furthermore, there are the three types of persons as follows. There are those who have correctly assumed the vow of ethical disci-pline of giving up the ten nonvirtues, which is not considered a vow and yet is similar to a vow. There are those who have cor-rectly assumed the sravaka's vow of ethical discipline. There are those who have correctly assumed the bodhisattva's vow of ethi-cal discipline. Among these, the first are the least; the second, me-dium; and the third, superior. Furthermore, the scriptures mention many ways of positing a least, a medium, and a superior person. Like Atisha's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, Vasubandhu's Abhidharma-kosa Auto-commentary (Abhidharma-kosa-bha~ya) defines221 the three types of persons.

However, the stages of the path for the person of great capacity also include the paths for the other two types of persons in their entirety. Thus, these two paths are parts, or branches, of the Mahayana path. [89] As the master Asvagho~a states in his Cultivation of the Conventional Spirit of Enlightenment (SarrLVrti-bodhicitta-bhavana):222 Being harmless, truthful, And chaste; not stealing, And giving away all your possessions: These are deeds that give rise to happy rebirths. Once you have seen the suffering of cyclic existence, You cultivate the true path to abandon it, And you eliminate the two misdeeds; These are the deeds that give rise to peace. A person of great capacity should practice all these; They are the branches of the path of the supreme determination to be free. The knowledge that all phenomena are emptinesses Creates the stream of compassion for all beings. Limitless deeds of skill-in-means Are the activity of the supreme determination to be free. Therefore, in this instance teachers lead you neither to the path for persons of small capacity, who make their goal the mere happiness of cyclic existence, nor to the path for persons of medium capacity, who make their goal the mere liberation from cyclic existence for their own sake. Rather, they take some of the paths that are common to"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Three Types of Persons 133 these two types of persons and make them prerequisites for leading you to the path for persons of great capacity. Thus they make them components of the training in the path for persons of great capacity. Therefore, once you have developed the desire to take full ad-vantage of this human life of leisure and opportunity as explained before, you must know how to take full advantage of it. With re-spect to that, Bhavaviveka's Heart of the Middle Way states:223 These bodies are insubstantial, Like banana trees and bubbles. Who would not give them a substance that is like Mount Meru By making them conditions for helping others? These bodies are a basis for sickness, old age, and death. Those who have good character and compassion Make them in each moment A basis for promoting happiness in others. This life of leisure is free of the eight conditions of nonleisure. With the lamp of the sublime teaching Make good use of this leisure Through the deeds of a person of great capacity. Thus, enter the Mahayana with the thought, \"Day and night I will conduct myself as a person of great capacity, making good use of this body of mine, which is a home for illness, a basis for the suffer-ings of old age and the like, and which lacks an essence like a ba-nana tree or a water bubble.\" Question: From the outset one should guide students through the practices of a person of great capacity. [90] What is the use of train-ing in paths which are shared with the persons of small and me-dium capacities? Reply: Training in the paths that are shared with these two is a prerequisite for the development of the path of a person of great capacity. I will explain how this is so. b) Why one guides students through such stages Why one guides students through such stages is explained in terms of the actual reason and the purpose. i) The actual reason The entrance to the Mahayana is solely the spirit of supreme en-lightenment. Once this is produced in your mind-stream, it is as Santideva states in his Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:224"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"134 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path The moment helpless beings, bound in the prison of cyclic existence, Develop this spirit of enlightenment They are called\" children of the sugatas\" ... Thus, these beings enter the Mahayana upon being named \"con-querors' children\" or \"bodhisattvas.\" If they ruin their spirit of enlightenment, they expel themselves from the company of Mahayana practitioners. Therefore, those who wish to enter the Mahayana must develop this spirit of enlightenment by making many forms of effort. The supreme texts that teach the stages of the bodhisattva path, Santideva's Compendium of Trainings and Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds, speak of how to develop it. They state that you first need to meditate on its benefits. Then you intensify your delight in these benefits from the depths of your heart. This must be accompanied with practicing the seven branches of worship along with the prac-tice of refuge. If you condense the benefits spoken of in this way, they are two-fold: temporary and final. The first is again twofold: not falling into miserable realms and being reborn in happy realms. That is, once you have developed this spirit of enlightenment, you clear away many previously accumulated causes for miserable rebirths, and you end the continuous accumulation of them in the future. You also vastly increase your previously accumulated causes of happy rebirths since they are imbued with this spirit. Furthermore, because you are motivated by this spirit, the causes that you create anew will be inexhaustible. [91] Relying upon this spirit of enlightenment, you will easily achieve the final aims, liberation and omniscience. From the outset you must have an uncontrived aspiration that seeks to attain these final and temporary benefits. If you do not have this, you might say, \"I will strive to develop this spirit\" on account of those benefits that arise from developing the spirit of enlighten-ment, but it will be mere words. The hollowness of this claim is very clear once you examine your mind. Therefore, first you must train in the thought that is common to persons of small and medium capacities in order to develop a wish to attain the two benefits, high status [as a human or deity] and certain goodness [liberation or omniscience]. After you have devel-oped such a wish, you engage in cultivating the spirit of enlighten-ment, the attitude that produces these benefits. As you do this, you must develop the great compassion and love that are the founda-tion of this attitude. In other words, when you contemplate how"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Three Types of Persons 135 you wander through cyclic existence, bereft of happiness and tor-mented by suffering, your body hairs should stand on end. With-out this experience, it would be impossible for you to become un-able to tolerate other beings' torment while they suffer and are bereft of happiness as they wander through cyclic existence. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:225 These beings have yet to dream Of such an attitude Toward even their own welfare; How then could they produce it for other's welfare? Consequently, in the context of the person of small capacity you reflect on how you are harmed by the suffering of the miserable realms. In the context of the person of medium capacity you con-template on how, even in high status, there is suffering and there is no peaceful bliss. Then you foster the development of love and compassion by cultivating a sense of empathy for living beings, whom you hold as close to you. From this you develop the spirit of enlightenment. Therefore, training in the thought common to per-sons of small and medium capacities is the method for producing an uncontrived spirit of enlightenment; it is not some separate path along which your teacher leads you. Accordingly, you work at many ways of purifying yourself of nonvirtue and accumulating virtue using the practices for devel-oping both the attitude that is shared with persons of small capac-ity and the attitude that is shared with persons of medium capac-ity. These are practices such as going for refuge and thinking about karma and its effects. [92] Understand that these too help you to develop the spirit of enlightenment, because they correspond to either the seven branches of worship or the practice of refuge, which are methods of training that are prerequisites for the spirit of en-lightenment in the context of the practices for the person of great capacity. At this point the guru thoroughly expounds the ways in which the trainings of the persons of small and medium capacities serve as components for the development of the spirit of unsurpassed en-lightenment. Moreover, you, the student, reach certain knowledge of this. Then, whenever you sustain a meditation, it is extremely important for you to keep this understanding in mind and train in these teachings as components for your development of the spirit of enlightenment. Otherwise, the path of the person of great capac-ity and the paths of the persons of small and medium capacities"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"136 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path would be separate and unrelated. And since you do not attain any certain knowledge of the spirit of enlightenment until you reach the actual path of the person of great capacity, your lack of training in these topics as components of your development of the spirit of enlightenment would either prevent you from developing that spirit, or, while you lack this training, cause you to deviate from your great purpose of developing that spirit. Therefore, pay close attention to this point. In this way, train in the paths of persons of small and medium capacities and train well in what is explained in the context of the person of great capacity. Then, to the best of your ability, develop an uncontrived spirit of enlightenment in your mind-stream. Next, in order to stabilize this spirit, make a special practice of refuge and then perform the rite of the aspirational spirit of enlightenment. After you have adopted this aspirational spirit through the rite, you must strive to learn its precepts. Then, develop a great yearning to learn the bodhisattva deeds, such as the six perfections and the four ways of gathering disciples. Once this yearning arises from the depths of your heart, decisively take up the pure vow of the en-gaged spirit of enlightenment. Then, at the risk of your life, avoid being polluted by the root infractions. Strive not to be soiled by even small and medium contaminations or by the creation of faults. Even if you are soiled, thoroughly purify yourself by repairing the in-fractions just as is taught in scripture. Next, train broadly in the six perfections. In particular, train well in meditative stabilization-the heart of meditative serenity-in order to make your mind capable of being set on a virtuous object of meditation, according to your wish. [93] The Elder's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment says226 that you should develop meditative serenity for the sake of producing the superknowledges. He is sim-ply giving an example. In other contexts he says that you should develop serenity for the sake of producing insight. Therefore, achieve serenity mainly for the purpose of insight. Then, in order to cut the bonds of the conception of the two selves, make a philo-sophical determination of the meaning of emptiness, which is self-lessness. After sustaining an unmistaken method of meditation, achieve insight, the heart of wisdom. Accordingly, Atisha's Commentary on the Difficult Points of the \"Lamp for the Path\" (Bodhi-miirga-pradlpa-panjika)227 states that, ex-cept for the practices of serenity and insight, all the practices up to and including the training in the precepts of the vow of the engaged"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Three Types of Persons 137 spirit of enlightenment constitute the training in ethical discipline. Serenity is the training in concentration or mind. Insight is the train-ing in wisdom. Furthermore, all the practices up to and including meditative serenity constitute the factor of enlightenment called either method, the collection of merit, the paths that depend on con-ventional truths, or the stages of the vast path. The development of the three kinds of special wisdom constitutes the factor of en-lightenment called wisdom, the collection of wisdom, that which depends on ultimate truths, or the stages of the profound path. Therefore, be very certain about their order, the fact that they are a comprehensive list, and the fact that you do not achieve enlighten-ment by either method or wisdom alone. This is how the royal geese, the conquerors' children, who are on their way to the great ocean of a buddha's good qualities, spread their two wings and fly. One wing is conventional truths-all of the factors of method, the vast path. The other wing, which depends on ultimate truths, is knowing well both reality and selflessness. However, they do not take up only a single part of the path, or fly like a bird with a broken wing. As Candrakirti's Commentary on the \"Middle Way\" states:228 Spreading the broad, white wings of reality and conventionality, The royal geese, escorted by the flock of living beings, Fly on the winds of virtue to supremacy On the far shore of a buddha's ocean-like qualities. [94] After you have trained your mind by means of the ordinary path, you must certainly enter the mantra path because, when you do, you will quickly complete the two collections. If you cannot prac-tice more than just the ordinary path, or do not want to do it be-cause your inclination inherited from former lives is too weak, then just improve on these very stages of the path. It is taught in all the vehicles in general and in the mantra ve-hicle in particular that reliance on the teacher is very crucial. Con-sequently, once you enter the mantra path, you should follow the mantra explanations, and practice a method of relying on the teacher that is even more specialized than what I have explained before. Then, ripen your mind with initiations that come from pure tantric sources, and observe properly, at the risk of your life, all of the vows and pledges that you have received during your initia-tions. You can take the vow or pledge again if you are affected by a root infraction, but your mind will have been spoiled, and it will be very difficult to give rise to good qualities. Therefore, specifically"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"138 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path strive never to be tainted by root infractions and not to be soiled by secondary infractions. Even if you are tainted by these, purify your-self of them with confession and restraint, since vows and pledges are the foundation of the path. Then train in good instructions on either the yoga with signs (in the context of the lower tantras), or the yoga of the generation stage (in the context of highest yoga tantra). After this training has been made firm, train well in either the yoga without signs (in the con-text of the lower tantras), or the yoga of the completion stage (in the context of highest yoga tantra). The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment presents the body of such a path; these stages of the path also instruct you in this way. The Great Elder taught this in other texts, as well. His Concise Method of Achieving the Mahayana Path (Mahayana-patha-sadhana-sal'J'lgraha) states: 229 If you wish to attain unsurpassed enlightenment, Which has inconceivable greatness, Be intent on practice and achieve its heart, For enlightenment depends upon practice. [95] As this body of perfect leisure and opportunity Was very difficult to obtain, and once obtained Will be very difficult to possess again, Make it meaningful by striving at practice. And his Concisely Written Method of Achieving the Mahayana Path (Mahayana-patha-sadhana-vanJa-sal'J'lgraha) says:230 Just as, when a chance arises For prisoners to flee from prison, They flee from that place, As their goals are not the same as others', So too if an opportunity arises To cross over this great ocean of cyclic existence, You emerge from this household of existence, As your goals are not the same as others'. Also:231 Taking up the bodhisattva vow through abiding In the practice of refuge, higher ethical discipline, And the basis of the aspirational spirit of enlightenment, Practice properly, in stages, with what ability you have, All the deeds of the bodhisattvas-The six perfections and the like."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Three Types of Persons 139 Also:232 Cultivate the heart of wisdom and method-Insight, meditative serenity, and their unification. Moreover, Bodhibhadra's Chapter on the Collections of Concentration (Samadhi-sambhara-parivarta) sta tes:233 First, make firm your spirit of perfect enlightenment, Which has arisen from the strength of compassion. Do not be attached to enjoying the resources of cyclic existence, And turn your back on grasping. Endowed with perfect jewels such as faith, Respect your guru, who is equal to the Buddha. With the pledges that this guru taught, Joyously persevere in your meditations. Receive through your guru's kindness The bestowal of initiations, both vase and secret. Purifying body, speech, and mind, Such practitioners are fit for attainments. By completing the collections That arise from the branch of concentration, They will quickly achieve the supreme attainment. This is the way of mantra. ii) The purpose Question: If the teachings for the persons of small and medium ca-pacities are prerequisites for the person of great capacity, they may as well be considered stages for the path of the person of great ca-pacity. [96] Why use the expression, \"stages of the path shared with the persons of small and medium capacities\"? Reply: There are two great purposes for differentiating three types of persons and guiding students accordingly: (1) it destroys the presumption of asserting that you are a person of great capacity despite not having developed the states of mind common to per-sons of small and medium capacities, and (2) it is of great benefit for those whose minds have the greatest, medium, and least capac-ity. How does it benefit them? Even the two persons of higher ca-pacities must seek high status and liberation, so it is not wrong to teach students of medium and great capacities the practices that develop the attitudes of persons of small capacity and persons of medium capacity. They will develop good qualities. Those persons of least capacity may train in higher practices, but this will lead to their giving up their lower perspective without"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"140 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path rising to a higher perspective, and thus they would be left with noth-ing. Furthermore, there could be persons who have the fortune to have already produced the higher paths in past lives. If they are taught the paths shared with persons of lower capacity and they then train in them, they will quickly give rise either to those good qualities developed previously or to those not developed before. Consequently, as they have already developed lower paths, they can be led to successively higher paths, and thus their own path from practice in earlier lives will not be delayed. The Questions of the Royal Lord of Formulae (Dharal':zisvara-raja-paripTccha)234 uses the example of a skillful jeweler gradually refin-ing a jewel in order to illustrate the need to guide the student's mind in stages. Wary of being verbose, I have not cited it in full here. The protector Nagarjuna also said to guide students in stages through the paths of high status and certain goodness:235 Initially there are the teachings on high status; Then come the teachings on certain goodness. For, having obtained high status, You gradually reach certain goodness. Also, the noble being Asanga states:236 Further, bodhisattvas cause their disciples to accomplish the vir-tuous factor of enlightenment correctly and in stages. In order to do this, they initially give easy teachings to beings of childlike wisdom, having them practice easy instructions and explications. When they recognize that these beings have become endowed with average wisdom, they have them practice average teachings and instructions, and average explications. [97] When they rec-ognize that these beings have become endowed with extensive wisdom, they have them practice profound teachings and instruc-tions, and subtle explications. This is the graduated flow of activ-ity for the welfare of these living beings. Also, Aryadeva's Lamp Which Is a Compendium of Deeds (Carya-melapaka-pradipa) describes how you first train in the thought of the perfection vehicle and then enter the mantra vehicle. It establishes that you must do so in stages. It then summarizes this point as fol-10ws:237 The method by which beings who are beginners Engage in the ultimate purpose Was said by the perfect Buddha To be like the steps of a staircase."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Three Types of Persons 141 Also, the Four Hundred Stanzas238 states that the order of the path is definite: Initially, you stop the nonmeritorious. In the middle, you stop the misconception of self. Finally, you put an end to all bad views; One who knows this is an adept. Also, the learned master Maqceta said:239 It is like dyeing cloth that is free of stains: First they develop goodness in the students' minds Through discussions on generosity and the like, And then they have them meditate on the teaching. Citing this passage, the great master Candrakirti also held that the path has a definite order. Since the order we use in guiding others along the path clearly is very crucial for their practice, reach firm certainty about this method."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"9 MINDFULNESS OF DEATH b.

Training the mind in the stages of the path shared with persons of small capacity (Chapters 9-16) 2. Training the mind in the stages of the path shared with persons of medium capacity (Chapters 17-24) 3. Training the mind in the stages of the path for persons of great capacity. 1) Training the mind in the stages of the path shared with persons of small capacity There are three divisions in this section: 1. The actual training of thought for a person of small capac-ity (Chapters 9-15) 2. The measure of the attitude of a person of small capacity (Chapter 16) 3. Clearing up misconceptions concerning the attitude of a person of small capacity (Chapter 16) a) The actual training of thought for a person of small capacity The actual training has two divisions: 1.

Relying on the means for achieving happiness in the next life (Chapters 11-15) i) Developing a state of mind that strives diligently for the sake of future lives This is explained in two parts: 1. Mindfulness of death, the contemplation that you will not remain long in this world (Chapter 9) 2. Contemplating what will occur in your future life: the hap-piness or suffering of the two types of beings (Chapter 10) a' Mindfulness of death, the contemplation that you will not remain long in this world Mindfulness of death has four parts: 1. The faults of not cultivating mindfulness of death"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 145 2. The benefits of such cultivation 3. The kind of mindfulness of death you should develop 4. How to cultivate mindfulness of death l' The faults of not cultivating mindfulness of death As previously mentioned, there are four errors that impede your taking full advantage of your life: [conceiving (1) the impure to be pure, (2) suffering to be happiness, (3) the impermanent to be per-manent, and (4) the selfless to have a self]. Initially, it is merely the conception of the impermanent to be permanent that is the avenue of much injury. This conception is twofold: coarse and subtle. Of these two, in the case of your coarse impermanence, which is your death, the avenue of injury is the very thought, \"I will not die.\" [99J Everyone has the idea that death will come later, at the end. How-ever, with each passing day people think, \"I will not die today; I will not die today,\" clinging to this thought until the moment of death. If you are obstructed by such an attitude and do not bring its remedy to mind, you will continue to think that you will remain in this life. Then, as long as you have this attitude, you will continually think only of how to achieve happiness and evade suffering in this life alone, thinking, \"I need this and that.\" You will not engage in reli-gious practice because you do not think about things of great im-portance, such as future lives, liberation, and omniscience. Although you may perchance engage in study, reflection, meditation, and so forth, it will be only for the sake of this life, and whatever virtue you create will be of meager strength. Moreover, since your prac-tice will be involved with wrongdoing, sins, and infractions, it would be rare for these virtuous activities not to be mixed with causes of miserable rebirths. Even if you try to engage in practices directed toward future lives, you will not be able to prevent the la-ziness of procrastination, thinking, \"I will do it eventually.\" By passing time in distractions such as sleep, lethargy, senseless talk, and eating and drinking, you will not attain proper achievement, which comes through great effort. If you are thus seduced by the hope that this body and life will last for a long time, you will create strong attachment to goods, ser-vices, and the like. As if swept away by the current of a river, you will be immersed in strong hostility toward what prevented you, or what you fear might prevent you, from having these objects of attachment; in delusion that is ignorant of their faults; and, as a con-sequence of these two, in afflictions such as pride and jealousy, as"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"146 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path well as strong secondary afflictions. As a result of this, you will do more nonvirtuous actions each day such as the ten misdeeds of body, speech, and mind, the five deeds of immediate retribution, other misdeeds approaching these in gravity/4o and the repudia-tion of the excellent teaching, all of which have the full power to induce strong suffering in places such as the miserable realms. [100] You will sap the life out of high status and certain goodness by in-creasingly distancing yourself from the remedies-the nectar of the well-spoken teachings. Then, death will overcome you and bad karma will lead you into a hot and unpleasant place among the strong and harsh sufferings of the miserable realms. What process could be worse than that? The Four Hundred Stanzas:241 What could be more dangerous Than to sleep as though at ease While subject to the Lord of Death, Ruler of the three worlds, himself without a master? Also, Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:242 I will have to depart, leaving everything. But, not knowing this, I committed various sins For the sake of friends and foes. 2' The benefits of cultivating mindfulness of death When those who have a little understanding of the teaching con-clude that they will die today or tomorrow, they see that friends and material possessions will not accompany them, and so they stop craving them. Naturally they then wish to take full advan-tage of their human birth through virtuous deeds such as giving gifts. Just so, if you create an authentic mindfulness of death, you will see that all toiling for worldly things such as goods, respect, and fame is as fruitless as winnowing chaff, and is a source of de-ception. Then you will turn away from wrongdoing. With con-stant and respectful effort you will accumulate good karma by doing such virtuous deeds as going for refuge and maintaining ethical discipline. You will thereby bring lasting significance to things, like the body, that would not have had such significance. You will ascend to a sublime state and will lead others there as well. What could be more meaningful? For this reason, the scriptures use many examples to praise the mindfulness of death. The Great Final NirvilIJa Satra says:243"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 147 Among all reapings, the autumn harvest is supreme. Among all tracks, the track of the elephant is supreme. [101] Among all ideas, the idea of impermanence and death is supreme because with it you eliminate all the attachment, ignorance, and pride of the three realms. Similarly, it is praised for being the hammer that instantly destroys all afflictions and wrongdoing, for being the gateway into the in-stantaneous achievement of all virtue and goodness, and so on. The Collection of Indicative Verses:244 Understanding that the body is like a clay vessel and Similarly, that phenomena are like mirages, Here you destroy the demons' poisonous flower-tipped weapons And pass beyond the sight of the Lord of Death. Also:245 By seeing aging, the suffering of sickness, And dead bodies from which the mind is gone, The resolute abandon this prisonlike home, While ordinary worldlings can never eliminate attachment. In brief, the only time to accomplish the aims of beings is now, when you have attained a special life of leisure and opportunity. The majority of us remain in the miserable realms; a few come to the happy realms, but the majority of these are in situations that lack leisure. Therefore, you do not get a chance to practice the teach-ings in these situations. Even when you have gained the circum-stances allowing for practice, the reason that you do not practice the teachings properly is the thought, \"I will not die yet.\" Therefore, the thought that you will not die is the source of all deterioration, and the remedy for this is mindfulness of death, the source of all that is excellent. Consequently, you should not think that this is a practice for those who do not have some other pro-found teaching to cultivate in meditation. Nor should you think that although this is something worthy of meditation, you should cul-tivate it just a little at the beginning of the meditation session be-cause it is not suitable for continuous practice. Rather, be certain from the depths of your heart that it is necessary in the beginning, middle, and end, and then cultivate it in meditation. [102] 3' The kind of mindfulness of death you should develop For those who have not practiced the path at all, the fear of death manifests itself as the worry that they will be separate from their relatives and so forth. This fear is caused by their strong attachment."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"148 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Therefore, do not develop this here. What, then, should you de-velop? Certainly nothing of your body, which you appropriated through karma and afflictions, shall survive death. This may frighten you, yet, for the time being, you cannot stop it. However, you should fear death if you have not secured your welfare in fu-ture lives by putting an end to the causes of the miserable realms and establishing the causes of high status and certain goodness. If you consider your fear about this, it is within your power not to be frightened at the moment of death because there are things you can do to secure your future welfare. If you do not act on these things, you will be tormented by regret at the time of death, in general fear-ing that you will not be liberated from cyclic existence and in par-ticular fearing that you will fall into a miserable realm. The Gar-land of Birth Stories:246 Though you hold fast, you cannot stay. What benefit is there In being frightened and scared Of what cannot be changed. Thus, when you analyze the nature of the world, Humans are regretful at death because they have sinned And have not brought forth virtuous actions. They worry about sufferings to come in future lives And the fear of dying clouds their minds. However, I do not know of anything I have done That would make me regretful, And I have made myself accustomed to virtuous actions. Why should anyone who abides in the teaching fear death? The Four Hundred Stanzas:247 Those who think with certainty, \"I will die,\" Give up fear. Therefore, How could they fear even the Lord of Death? [103] Thus, when you contemplate impermanence again and again, you think, \"I will undoubtedly separate from my body and re-sources soon,\" and you stop the craving that hopes not to leave them. Consequently, you will not fear death out of the distress of leaving. 4' How to cultivate mindfulness of death Cultivate this by way of the three roots, nine reasons, and three decisions. The three roots are:"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Mindfulness afDeath 149 (1) death is certain; (2) the time of death is uncertain; and (3) at the time of death nothing helps except religious practice. a\" The contemplation that death is certain Meditation on the certainty of death has three aspects: (1) the Lord of Death will definitely come, and therefore can-not be avoided; (2) our lifetime cannot be extended and constantly dimin-ishes; and (3) while you are alive, there is little time for religious practice. I\" The contemplation that the Lord of Death will definitely come, and therefore cannot be avoided No matter what kind of body you assume at birth, death comes. The Collection of Indicative Verses:248 If all the buddhas, and their Pratyekabuddha and srtivaka disciples Left their bodies, What can be said about ordinary beings? No matter where you stay, death comes. The same text says:249 Somewhere to live that is unharmed by death-Such a place does not exist. It does not exist in space, it does not exist in the sea, Nor if you stay in the midst of mountains. Death's destruction of living beings is no different at any point in the past or future. The same text says: The wise know that all Who have come and will come perish, Leave this body, and go to the next life. Therefore, be sure to engage in pure behavior by abiding in the teaching. You do not escape by fleeing from death, nor can you turn death away by such things as mantras. The Advice to the King Sidra (Rajavavadaka) says:2S0 For example, four great mountains from the four directions-being hard, firm, solid-cored, indestructible, unsplittable, with-out fissures, extremely resilient, and massed into one-rise up into the sky and destroy the earth.

Great King, in the same way, these four frights come, and it is not easy to quickly run away, or to turn them away with force, wealth, sub-stances, mantras, or medicine. What are the four? They are ag-ing, sickness, death, and decay. Great King, aging comes and de-stroys youth, sickness comes and destroys health, decay comes and destroys all that is excellent, and death comes and destroys life. It is not easy to quickly run away from them, or to turn them away with force or wealth, or to quell them with substances, mantras, or medicine. Ga-ma-pa (Ka-ma-ba) said, \"Now we should be frightened by death. At the time of death we should be fearless. But we are the opposite-we are not afraid now and at the moment of death we dig our fingernails into our chests.\" 2\" The contemplation that our lifetime cannot be extended and constantly diminishes The Descent into the Womb SiUra says:251 Currently, if we protect our bodies well in order to live comfort-ably, we will live, at the longest, one hundred years or a little more. Thus, the maximum is no more than this. Even though it may be possible to live this long, the time until death passes very quickly. A year is consumed with the passage of months; months with the passage of days; and days with the passage of day and night, also with such periods of time as a morning, etc. Thus, few of us reach the expected life span of one hundred years, for much of our life span seems to be finished already, and what remains cannot be extended even for a moment. [105] Life diminishes day and night without a break. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:252 This life is constantly lost Day and night without a pause, And there is nothing which can extend it. Why should death not come to someone like me? Contemplate this with many examples. When weaving cloth, weavers use no more than one piece of thread on each pass, yet they quickly finish weaving the cloth. When animals such as sheep are led to slaughter, they move closer to death with every step they take. The water carried by the current of a strong river or the water in a waterfall on a steep mountain quickly disappears. Just as in these"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 151 examples, your life is quickly spent and gone. Just as when herds-men pick up their sticks, their livestock helplessly follow them home, so sickness and aging lead you helplessly into the presence of the Lord of Death. In this way, meditate on the certainty of death from many perspectives. The Collection of Indicative Verses:253 For example, just as when weaving a cloth You reach the end By weaving individual courses, So too is human life. For example, just as those who are to be killed Come closer to the killing place With every step they take, So too is human life. Just as the strong downward current of a river Cannot be reversed, So too the movement of human life Is irreversible. Life is hard, brief, And full of suffering. It vanishes so quickly-Like that written on water with a stick. Just as livestock go home When the herdsmen raise their sticks, So sickness and aging lead humans To the Lord of Death. Furthermore, it is said that the Great Elder went to the bank of a river and meditated, saying that the rippling flow of the water was good for meditation on impermanence. The Extensive Sport Satra (Lalita-vistara-satra)254 also speaks of impermanence with many examples: [106] The three worlds are impermanent like an autumn cloud. The birth and death of beings is like watching a dance. The passage of life is like lightning in the sky; It moves quickly, like a waterfall. Thus, once inward reflection yields some sense of certainty about impermanence, contemplate it by applying your understanding of it to many things, for it is said that everything around us teaches impermanence. After you reflect on this again and again, you reach certain knowl-edge. It is not helpful to do just a little reflection and then say that"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"152 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path nothing happened. As Ga-ma-pa said, \"You say that nothing hap-pened when you thought about it, but when did you reflect? If it was during the day, you were constantly distracted, and at night you slept. Do not lie!\" At the end of this life, the Lord of Death will destroy you and you will pass into the next world. Until then, there will never be a time when your life span does not diminish, whether you are go-ing somewhere, walking around, or lying down. Thus, starting from the moment that you enter the womb, you do not remain for even an instant, but go headlong toward the next lifetime. Therefore, even your intervening life is exclusively consumed in a procession to-ward death led by the messengers, sickness and aging. Conse-quently, do not rejoice in the thought that while you are living you are stationary and not moving toward the next lifetime. For ex-ample, when falling from the top of a high cliff, the time of falling to earth through space is not enjoyable. As cited by Candrakirti in his Commentary on the \"Four Hundred Stanzas\" (Catu~-sataka-tika):255 Hero of humans, beginning from the first night Of entering a womb in this world, One proceeds daily, without delay Into the presence of the Lord of Death. In the Story for Stopping the Four Errors (Catur-viparyaya-parihara-katha) it says:256 Do those who fall to earth from the peak of a high mountain Enjoy happiness in space as they are being destroyed? If they are constantly racing toward death from the time they are born, [107] How can living beings find happiness in the time in between? These passages indicate that it is certain that your death will come quickly. 3\" The contemplation of the certainty of death such that even while you are alive there is little time for religious practice Even if you could live for the longest period explained above, it would be wrong to think that you have time. Much of your life has already been wasted. Half of what is left will be spent in sleep, and many of your waking hours will be wasted with other distractions. Further, as youth fades, the time of aging arrives. Your physical and mental strength deteriorate such that even if you want to practice religion, you lack the capacity to do so. Consequently, you have no"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 153 more than a few chances to practice the teachings. The Descent into the Womb Sidra says:257 Moreover, half of the one-hundred-year life span is covered by sleep. Ten years are childhood. Twenty years are old age. Sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental discomfort, and agitation take up time. Many hundreds of different physical illnesses also consume your time. The Story for Stopping the Four Errors says:258 In this time of one-hundred-year life spans even the longest of human lives is finished in only one hundred years. Of that, the beginning and end are made useless by youth and old age. Things like sleep and sickness destroy all hope for practice, leaving no time for it. How much remains to the life span of a being born among humans, who live in happiness? Furthermore, Chay-ga-wa said that if you subtract from sixty years the time you lose to food and clothing, sleep, and sickness, not more than five years are left to devote to the teachings. This being the case, the wonders of this life will be mere memo-ries at the time of death, like waking up and remembering the plea-surable experiences in a single dream. Think, \"If the enemy, death, is surely approaching and cannot be stopped, why should I delight in the delusions of this life?\" [108J Then decide that you must prac-tice the teaching and make many heartfelt pledges to do so. The Garland of Birth Stories:259 Alas, afflicted and worldly persons, I do not like unstable things. Even this glorious white water lily (kumada) Will become a memory. Alas, it is amazing that you beings are fearless, Placed in a realm like this. You are joyous and act unworried Though the Lord of Death blocks every path. As you have the powerful, dangerous, and unstoppable enemies Of sickness, aging, and death, You surely will go to a fearful place in the next life. I wonder what thoughtful person would delight in this?

While such murder is sure to come, What wise person would be relaxed? Hence, as long as that great unforgiving warrior Has not fired the unstoppable arrow From which there is no escape, Strive for your own welfare. Reflect in this way. b\" The contemplation that the time of death is uncertain It is certain that death will come sometime between today and one hundred years from now; it is uncertain on which day within that period death will come. Therefore, for instance, you cannot deter-mine whether or not you will die today. However, you must assume that you will die and should think, III will die today.\" For, if you assume that you will not die and think, III will not die today,\" or, III probably will not die today,\" you will continually make prepara-tions to stay in this life and will not prepare for your next life. Mean-while, you will be seized by the Lord of Death, and you will then die in sorrow. If you prepare for death every day, you will accom-plish many goals for your next life. Hence, even if you do not die today, you will have done well. If you do die, it is even more mean-ingful in that you will have done what you needed to do. [109] For example, when it is certain that a great enemy is coming to do you severe harm sometime between now and some point in the future, but you do not know on which day the enemy will come, you must be cautious every day. It is like that. If you think every day, III will die today,\" or at least III will prob-ably die today,\" you will act for the benefit of whatever next life you will go to, and you will not make preparations to remain in this life. If you do not have this thought, you will see yourself as staying in this life, and you will make provisions for this life rather than act for the benefit of your next life. For example, when you plan to stay someplace for a long time, you make preparations to stay there. If you think that you are not going to stay there, but are going elsewhere, you make preparations for leaving. Hence, every day you must develop an awareness of the imminence of your death in the following way. I\" The contemplation that the life span in this world (Jambudvipa) is uncertain"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 155 In general, the life span on the Uttarakuru continent is definite. Even though on the other continents besides Uttarakuru and Jambudvipa there is no certainty as to whether one will be able to complete one's own life span, for the most part there is a definite life span. The life span on Jambudvipa is very indefinite, ranging from the initial life span that is vast beyond measure, to an eventual maximum length of ten years of age. Further, you can see that there is no certainty as to whether death will occur in youth, in old age, or in between. In the same vein, the Treasury of Knowledge says:261 Here the life span is uncertain: at the end of the cycle, It is ten years; in the beginning, measureless. The Collection of Indicative Verses says:262 Among the many beings seen in the morning Some are not seen in the evening. Among the many beings seen in the evening Some are not seen in the morning. Also: When many men and women And even youths die, How can the living be so confident to say, \"This person is still too young to die\"? Some die in the womb, Some at birth, Some when they can crawl, Some when they can run. Some are old, some are young, Some are young adults. Everyone goes gradually, Like ripe fruit falling. [110] Bear in mind the cases you have seen or heard concerning the gu-rus and friends who reached the end of their life span but died without fulfilling their intentions, suddenly dying because of ex-ternal and internal causes. Be aware of death, thinking over and over, \"I too am subject to such a death.\" 2\" The contemplation that the causes of death are very many and the causes of life few There are many sentient beings and insentient things that do harm to this life. Think in detail about the many forms of injury inflicted"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"156 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path by humans and nonhuman demons; how many dangerous animals harm life and limb; and similarly how harm occurs due to internal diseases and external elements. Furthermore, your body must be created from the four elements---earth, water, fire, and wind-and even these are harmful to each other when they become imbalanced. When some are in excess and others are deficient, an illness devel-ops, and you are robbed of your life. Hence, as these dangers are innately present within you, there is no security in body and life. In this vein, the Great Final Nirvcl1:za SiUra says: The idea of death is that hateful enemies constantly surround this life, ruining it at every moment. Nothing exists that extends your life. Also, Nagarjuna's Precious Garland (Ratnavali) says:263 You dwell among the causes of death Like a butter lamp standing in a strong breeze. In addition, his Friendly Letter says:264 Life is more impermanent than a water bubble Battered by the winds of many perils. Thus, that you can inhale after exhaling, Or awaken from sleep-these things are fantastic. The Four Hundred Stanzas says:265 When the four elements are powerless to harm each other, They are called a balanced collection, and physical pleasure arises. [111J But it is totally unsuitable to call \"pleasurable\" A collection that is in opposition. Because this is a time when the five impurities are rapidly spread-ing/66 there are extremely few persons who accumulate the great power of virtuous deeds that enables a long life. Also, since the medicinal power of our food and such is weak, we have little resis-tance to disease. The provisions we do use are not easy to digest and thus have diminished power for enhancing the body's great elements. Further, since you have done little to amass the collec-tion of merit and your wrongdoing is very potent, practices such as mantra recitation have little efficacy. All of this makes it extremely difficult to prolong your life. Furthermore, there are no causes of staying alive that do not become causes of death. In other words, you seek such things as food and drink, shelter, and friends in order not to die, but even these can become causes of death. For instance, you may consume"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 157 the wrong food and drink, or consume too much or too little. Your shelter could crumble, or your friends could deceive you. Thus, it is clear that there are no causes of staying alive that cannot become causes of death. Since life itself is headed toward death, the condi-tions for life would offer no security even if they were numerous. The Precious Garland:267 The causes of death are many, Those of staying alive, few. These too become causes of death. Thus, always practice the teaching. 3\" The contemplation that the time of death is uncertain because the body is very fragile Your body is very fragile, like a water bubble. Therefore, it does not take much damage to destroy it. Your life could be taken even by something that you only imagine to be harmful, like being pricked by a thorn. Hence, you can very easily be overcome by any of the causes of death. The Friendly Letter says:268 [112] If not even ash will remain when the physical world-The earth, Mount Meru, and the seas-Is burned up by seven blazing suns, What need is there to mention humans, who are so very frail? After you have reflected in this way, you should resolve that since there is no certainty as to when the Lord of Death will destroy your body and life, you will practice the teaching right now, without assuming that you still have time. Make this pledge many times from the depths of your heart. The Letter to Kani$ka says:269 The Lord of Death, a friend to no one, Descends suddenly. So do not wait, Saying, \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" Practice the sublime teaching with urgency. It is not good for people to say, \"I'll put it off until tomorrow and do this today.\" A tomorrow when you are gone Will undoubtedly come. Furthermore, the lord of yogis, Sri Jagan-mitranandapo says: Lord of the Earth, while this borrowed body Is still healthy, without sickness or deterioration, Take full advantage of it, Acting in order to end your fear of sickness, death, and deterio-ration."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"158 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Once sickness, aging, deterioration, and the like occur, You might remember to practice, but what can you do then? The contemplation of the uncertainty of the time of death is the most important of the three roots.

Consequently, think, \"It will certainly come to pass that all the wonders of this world will leave me behind; I will leave them be-hind as well, and go to some other world. In fact, this will happen today!\" [113] Contemplate how, at the time of death, only religious practice will serve as a refuge, a protection, a defense. The Letter to Kani~ka says:271 When the past karma that caused This life is spent, And you are connected with new karma And led by the Lord of Death, Everyone turns back. Except for your virtue and sin, Nothing will follow you. Know this and act well. Also, Sri Jagan-mitrananda says:272 Divine One, no matter what fortune you have gained, When you depart to another life, As though conquered by an enemy in the desert, You are alone without children or queen, Without friends, without clothing, Without kingdom, and without palace."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Mindfulness of Death 159 Though you have limitless power and armies, You will not see or hear them. Eventually not even one being or thing Will follow after you. In brief, if you lack even a name, What need is there to speak about anything else? Try to achieve lasting happiness for your next life and beyond by being mindful of death in this way, reflecting on how leisure and opportunity are very important, are difficult to obtain, and are very easily lost despite being difficult to obtain. If instead you seek only to find happiness and to avoid suffering up until your death, then you are going to need a course of conduct which surpasses animal behavior, since animals are better than humans at temporal happi-ness. Otherwise, even though you have obtained a life in a happy realm, it will be just as though you had not. For, as Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:273 Those who are tortured by bad karma Waste their wonderful leisure and opportunity, so hard to gain, In order to acquire some trifling thing Which is not so rare and which even animals may attain. Therefore, although it is quite hard to produce this mindfulness of death, you must work at it because it is the foundation of the path. Bo-do-wa said: For me \"appearance and exclusion\" refers to my own meditation on impermanence.274 [114] With it I exclude all the appearances of this life such as intimates, relatives, and possessions. Then, knowing that I must always go to the next life alone, without anything else, I think that I will do nothing except religious prac-tice. Thereupon, a lack of attachment for this life begins. Until this arises in your mind, the paths of all the teachings remain blocked. Also, Dol-wa said: Along the way, accumulate the collections and purify obscurations. Make supplications to the deity and the guru. Contemplate ear-nestly and with perseverance. If you do these, though you may think that knowledge will not arise in even one hundred years, it will arise anyway because nothing composite remains as it is. When someone asked Ga-ma-pa about changing the object of meditation, he said to use the same one again.

It is extremely important to meditate in general on the sufferings of cyclic existence and, in particular, on the sufferings of the miser-able realms, for if you contemplate how you have fallen into the ocean of suffering, you will then turn away from it, and thereby overcome your pride and arrogance. Seeing suffering as the result of nonvirtuous karma, you will be careful to avoid sins and infrac-tions. Since you want happiness, not suffering, and understand that happiness is the result of virtue, you enjoy cultivating virtue. Once you have assessed your OWn condition, you develop compassion for others. After you have turned away from cyclic existence, you develop an aspiration for liberation. Frightened by suffering, you fervently go for refuge to the three jewels. Meditation On suffering is the great summary that includes these and many other key points of practice. Similarly, Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:277 Since without suffering there is no determination to be free, You, mind, stay fixed! And also: Furthermore, the good qualities of suffering are that you Dispel arrogance with your disenchantment, Develop compassion for the beings of cyclic existence, Carefully avoid sin, and delight in virtue. And further: Overwhelmed by fear, I offer myself to Samantabhadra.

The Reviving Hell, the first, lies thirty-two thousand leagues beneath us; the other seven are situated every four thousand leagues beneath that. The living beings of the Reviving Hell assemble and hack each other with various weapons that appear one by one through the force of karma, un-til they swoon and fall to the ground. Then a voice from the sky commands, \"Revive!\" and they rise up again, hack each other as before, and experience measureless suffering. In the Black Line Hell, the hell-guardians use black lines to mark [the bodies of] the living beings born there into quarters, eighths, and many other smaller divisions. The beings experience the pain of being split and chopped along these lines with weap-ons. When the living beings in the Crushing Hell gather and con-gregate, the hell guardians herd them all between two iron moun-tains shaped like goat heads and then squeeze them between the mountains, causing streams of blood to gush from all their ori-fices. They are also pressed between sheep-headed, horse-headed, elephant-headed, lion-headed, and tiger-headed mountains. When they gather together again, they are inserted into a great iron machine and pressed like sugarcane. Then they reassemble on an iron surface, where great iron boulders are hurled upon them, cutting, splitting, smashing, and flattening them, again caus-ing torrents of blood to gush forth. [117] In the Howling Hell living beings who search for a home are herded into an iron house and incinerated by blazing fire and conflagration. The Great Howling Hell is similar to this, except that the beings are inside two iron houses, one within the other. In the Hot Hell the hell-guardians throw the living beings into a hot, blazing iron kettle many leagues across and boil them, deep-frying them like fish. Then they impale them through their anuses with blazing iron skewers, which emerge through the crowns of their heads; blazing flames leap forth from their mouths, eyes, noses, ears, and from all of their pores. Then they are placed ei-ther on their backs or face down on a blazing iron surface, where they are pounded flat with a hot, blazing iron hammer. In the Extremely Hot Hell the guardians force iron tridents into their vic-tims' anuses, the left and right prongs coming out at their shoul-ders and the center prong at the crowns of their heads, causing blazing flames to shoot out from their mouths and other orifices. Their bodies are caught in a hot, blazing iron press; they are thrown head-first into a great blazing iron kettle full of boiling water and boiled, floating up, down, and all around, until their"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"164 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path skin, flesh, and blood are destroyed and only their skeletons re-main. Thereupon the guardians fish them out, spread them on the iron surface-where their skin, flesh, and blood regenerate-and then throw them back into the kettle. The remaining torments are similar to those of the Hot Hell. In the Unrelenting Hell the ground blazes for many hundreds of leagues from the east. As this blaze increases, it assumes the force of a conflagration. It then gradually incinerates the skin, flesh, intestines, and bones of the living beings, penetrating all the way to their marrow. [118] The beings' entire bodies are engulfed in blazing flames, as if they were the wicks of butter lamps. The same thing occurs from the other three directions. When the fires arrive from all four directions, they combine, and the beings ex-perience uninterrupted suffering. You know them to be living beings only by the piteous wails they emit. On other occasions they are placed into blazing iron embers in an iron winnowing basket, and the basket is shaken violently. On other occasions they are forced to climb up great iron mountains, then fall from them onto an iron surface. On other occasions their tongues are pulled out of their mouths and stretched out with a hundred iron pegs, like ox hides, until they have no wrinkles or ridges. At other times, they are laid out on their backs on the iron surface, and their mouths are pried open with iron tongs, while blazing lumps of iron and boiling copper are forced in until their mouths, esophagi, and intestines are burned and the residue flows out below. The other torments are like those of the Extremely Hot Hell. This is only a rough description of the torments, but there are many others as well. I have written about the locations and suffer-ings of these hells exactly as they are explained in the Levels ofYo-gic Deeds. The duration of these sufferings is explained in the Friendly Letter:279 Even though you experience Such horrible sufferings for a billion years, You do not die Until the nonvirtue is spent. Thus, you must experience these sufferings until the force of your karma is exhausted. In reference to this it is said that fifty human years is a single day for the deities of the Heaven of the Four Great Kings [lowest of the six types of deities in the desire realm], thirty of these is a month, and twelve of these is a year. Five hundred such years is the life span of these deities. Taking all of that as a single day, thirty such days as a month, and twelve such months as a year, the life span of the hell denizens in the Reviving Hell is five hundred"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Reflecting on Your Future Life 165 such years. [119] Similarly, one hundred, two hundred, four hun-dred, eight hundred, and sixteen hundred human years, respec-tively, equal single days for the deities from the Heaven of the Thirty-three through to those of the Heaven of Controlling Others' Emanations [the rest of the six types of desire realm deities]. Their life spans are one thousand, two thousand, four thousand, eight thousand, and sixteen thousand divine years. These periods make up single days respectively for the hell denizens from the Black Line through the Hot hells, who endure from one thousand up to six-teen thousand of their own years. The Treasury of Knowledge says:280 Fifty human years Is a single day for the lower deities Of the desire realm; This is doubled for the higher deities. And also: The life span of the desire realm deities is equal to a day In the six hells, the Reviving Hell and so forth, in sequence. Thus their life spans Are similar to those of the desire realm deities. The life span in the Extremely Hot Hell is half of an intermedi-ate eon; In the Unrelenting Hell it is an intermediate eon. The Levels of Yogic Deeds explains this in the same way.281 b\" Contemplating the suffering of the adjoining hells Each of the eight hot hells has four walls and four doors and is encircled by an iron fence, which has four doors. At each of these doors there are four additional hells for living beings: the Pit of Embers, the Swamp of Putrid Corpses or the Swamp of Excrement that Stinks Like a Corpse, the Path of Razors and Such, and the River with No Ford. The first of these contains embers in which the denizens sink up to their knees. When these beings go there in search of a home, they step into it, and their skin, flesh, and blood are completely de-stroyed, only to regenerate when they lift their feet out again. Not far away lies the second hell, a swamp of excrement stink-ing like a corpse, into which living beings seeking a home attempt to cross but fall, sinking in over their shoulders. The swamp is in-habited by \"sharp-beaked worms,\" which pierce the skin, flesh, intestines, and bones, boring down to the marrow.

When living beings who seek a home sit down to rest there in the shade, swords drop down from the trees, piercing and splitting their limbs, fin-gers, and toes. When they swoon, they are attacked by mongrel dogs, who carry them off by the scruffs of their necks and eat them. Nearby is the Forest of Iron Silk-cotton Trees. Living beings who seek a home come and climb these trees, which are covered with thorns that point downwards on the way up and upwards on the way down, so that the thorns pierce and split the beings' limbs, fin-gers, and toes. Iron-beaked crows sit on their shoulders or heads and pluck out and eat their eyeballs. Since all of these places sub-ject their inhabitants to harm by means of weapons, they should be counted as one adjoining hell. The fourth hell is nearby the silk-cotton trees. The River with No Ford is full of boiling water. Living beings who seek a home fall into it and are tossed about and cooked, as though they were peas thrown into a pot of water over a great blazing fire. On both banks of this river sit beings, armed with clubs, hooks, and nets, who keep the tormented from escaping, or who drag them out with the hooks and nets and lay them on their backs on the great blazing ground, demanding to know what they want. When they reply, \"We do not understand at all and cannot see, but we are hungry and thirsty,\" they are fed blazing lumps of iron and boiling copper. [121] I have presented these hells in accordance with the Levels of Yo-gic Deeds as well. It states that the life spans of living beings in the adjoining hells and occasional hells are not fixed, but they must suf-fer in these places for a long time, until the power of the karma for experiencing these sufferings is exhausted. c\" Contemplating the suffering of the cold hells Each of the eight great hells of living beings is ten thousand leagues in breadth, and the eight cold hells lie outside of these. The first, the Blistering Hell, is thirty-two thousand leagues below the earth. The other seven are situated every two thousand leagues beneath that. In the Blistering Hell the denizens are blasted by a great wind that shrivels and then raises blisters all over their bodies. The Popping Blis-ters Hell is similar, except that the blisters pop as the body shrivels. The Chattering-teeth, Weeping, and Moaning hells are named after the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Reflecting on Your Future Life 167 sounds the denizens make. In the Splitting Water-Lily Hell the deni-zens are blasted by a great wind, which causes them to turn blue and split into five or six pieces. In the Splitting-like-a-Lotus Hell, the denizens turn from blue to red, and split into ten or more pieces, while in the Great-Splitting-like-a-Lotus Hell, the denizens' skin be-comes very red and splits into a hundred or more pieces. I have presented the sequence, sizes, and sufferings of these hells in ac-cordance with the Levels of Yogic Deeds. The Garland of Birth Stories says that these hell denizens dwell in darkness as follows:282 In the future life of a nihilist A cold wind will rise in that place of absolute darkness. Since it will make you so ill that even your bones will be destroyed, Who will want to enter there to help you? Also, the Letter to a Student says:283 An incomparable wind pierces your bones; [122] Your body shakes and freezes; you bend over and shrivel. Hundreds of blisters rise and pop. Creatures born from them eat and claw you; fat, lymph, and marrow ooze out. Exhausted, teeth clenched, all hair standing on end, You are tormented by wounds in your eyes, ears, and gullet. Mind and body stupefied by pain, You dwell in the cold hell and emit a pitiful wail. You experience these sufferings until the bad karma [that causes them] is exhausted. The Levels of Yogic Deeds says:284 Understand that the life span of living beings born in the cold hells is one-and-a-half times as long as that of the living beings born in the corresponding great hells of living beings. Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary quotes a siitra as follows:285 For example, 0 monks: Fill a vessel full of sesame, heaping with eighty measures as it is measured here in Magadha. Then have someone cast out a single sesame seed every hundred years. 0 monks, in such a fashion this vessel becomes completely empty very quickly and much sooner than the complete life span of the living beings born in the Blistering Hell, but I cannot say what such a life span is. 0 monks, twenty life spans of the Blistering Hell make up a single life span in the Popping Hell."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"168 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path And so on until, Also, 0 monks, twenty life spans of the Splitting-like-a-Lotus Hell make up a single life span in the Great-Splitting-like-a-Lotus Hell. Thus, they live for such a period of time. d\" Contemplating the suffering of the occasional hells The occasional hells adjoin the hot hells and cold hells, and the Levels of Yogic Deeds says that they exist in the human regions as well. Ac-cording to the Bases of Discipline,286 they also exist near the shores of great lakes, as depicted in the Edifying Tale of Sa1J1gharak~ita (Sa1J1gharak~itavadana). 287 [123] The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary also says:288 These sixteen hells for living beings are created by the force of the karma of all living beings. The occasional hells are created by the individual karma of one, two, or many living beings, and there-fore are of many different types. They have no fixed location, since they exist in rivers, mountains, wastelands, below the earth, and in other places as well. Thus, as explained below, the conditions for being born in any of these hells are very easy to create, and every single day you ac-quire more of them. Since you have already accumulated innumer-able causes in the past, your complacence is inappropriate. There-fore, after reflecting on these hells, be frightened-nothing separates you from them after the mere cessation of your breath. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:289 Having created the karma for hell, Why are you complacent like this? And the Friendly Letter:29o Sinners who hear of the boundless sufferings in the hells-Separated from them only until the mere termination of their breathing-And are not completely terrified, Have hearts as hard as diamonds. If you are frightened merely by seeing paintings of hell, By hearing of it, recalling it, Reading about it, and by representations of it, What need to mention experiencing the fierce actuality of it? Among the sufferings of cyclic existence, those of the miserable realms are the most difficult to endure. Among these, the sufferings"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Reflecting on Your Future Life 169 of the hells are the most unbearable, for the pain of being continu-ally pierced by three hundred sharp spears for a full day is nothing compared to even the mildest of the hells' sufferings. Among the hells, the suffering of the Unrelenting Hell is by far the greatest. The Friendly Letter:291 Just as among all kinds of happiness The cessation of craving is the king of happinesses, [124] So among all kinds of suffering The suffering of the Unrelenting Hell is most fierce. The suffering of being viciously pierced With three hundred lances for a full day Cannot compare, cannot even be mentioned, With the least sufferings of hell. Know that the sole cause of such sufferings is your physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing. Strive with whatever human skill you have not to be defiled by even the slightest wrongdoing. The same text says: The seed of these nonvirtuous results Is your physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing. Strive wit!1 whatever skill you possess Not to have even a bit of it! 2' Contemplating the suffering of animals Powerful animals kill weaker ones. Deities and humans exploit animals. Since others control them, animals have no independence, and are harmed, beaten, and killed. The Levels of Yogic Deeds explains that since they dwell with deities and men, they have no other abode. The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary says:292 Animals range over the land, in the water, and in the sky. Their pri-mary abode is the great ocean, and the others have spread from there. Also, the Friendly Letter:293 In rebirth as an animal there are various sufferings-Being killed, bound, beaten, and so forth. Those who have cast away the virtues of peace Horribly eat each other. Some die because of their pearls, fur, Bone, meat, or skin. Other powerless animals are put to work By being kicked, hit, whipped, jabbed with an iron hook, or prodded. [125]"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"170 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path The first verse teaches the general sufferings of animals and the second the specific sufferings. The words \"and so forth\" in \"beaten, and so forth\" include being put to work, having their noses pierced, and the like, and even refer to humans and nonhumans killing them, and so on. \"Eat each other\" refers to the harm common to all ani-mals. \"The virtues of peace\" denotes the virtues that lead to nirv(1).a. Those who cast these away are indicated to be very stupid and unsuitable for the path. \"Being kicked\" through to being \"prodded\" refer to the five ways of putting animals to work-horses, buffa-loes, donkeys, elephants, and oxen and the like, respectively. The foregoing comments are drawn from Mahamati's Clear Words: Ex-planation of the \"Friendly Letter. \"294 Some animals are born in darkness or in water, where they then age and die. Others are exhausted by heavy burdens. Some plow, are shorn, or are chased. Others are killed after being rendered help-less by various methods of slaughter. Some are tormented by hun-ger, thirst, sun, and wind. Others are harmed in different ways by hunters. Thus, they are constantly fearful. After reflecting on the ways in which they suffer, become disenchanted and repulsed. As far as their life spans are concerned, the Treasury of Knowledge says,295 \"the longest, an eon.\" He explains that the most long-lived animals endure for about an eon, and that the life spans of short-lived animals are not fixed. 3' Contemplating the suffering of hungry ghosts Those who are exceedingly miserly are born as hungry ghosts. These beings are hungry and thirsty, and their skin, flesh, and blood are desiccated, giving them the appearance of burnt logs. Their faces are covered with hair, their mouths are extremely dry, and their tongues lick their lips constantly. There are three types of hungry ghosts: a\" Hungry ghosts who have external obstacles for obtaining food and drink When these hungry ghosts approach springs, lakes, and ponds, beings holding swords, long spears, and short spears block their way. [126] Or else the water appears to them as pus and blood, and they lose the desire to drink. b\" Hungry ghosts who have internal obstacles for obtaining food and drink These beings have goiters and great bellies, but their mouths, which spew flames, are as small as the eye of a needle. Though others do"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Reflecting on Your Future Life 171 not prevent them, they are unable to ingest food or drink even when they obtain it. c\" Hungry ghosts who have obstacles within the food and drink Some of these hungry ghosts, unable to make use of clean and wholesome food and drink, cut their own flesh and eat it. Those called \"Possessing a Garland of Flames\" are burned because what-ever they attempt to eat or drink bursts into flames. Those called \"Filth-Eaters\" can only ingest dirty, stinking, harmful, and despi-cable things, and so they eat feces and drink urine. With respect to their abodes, the Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary says:296 The king of the hungry ghosts is called \"Yama.\" Their primary abode is five hundred leagues beneath the city of Rajagrha in Jambudvlpa. The others have spread from there. Also, the Friendly Letter says:297 Hungry ghosts never heal the suffering Of destitution due to desire. They are subject to very fierce suffering Produced by hunger, thirst, cold, heat, exhaustion, and fear. Some, with mouths the size of a mere needle's eye And stomachs as round as mountains, Are tormented by hunger, lacking the energy to search For even a bit of filthy garbage. Some have bodies of skin and bones, like a leafless tree, Like a palm tree without its top. Some, mouths on fire each night, Eat food that causes their mouths to blaze. Some wretched ones do not even find filth Such as pus, excrement, blood and the like; Hitting each others' faces, they drink the pus That oozes from the ripe goiters at their necks. For these hungry ghosts in summer The moon is hot, and in winter the sun cold. [127] For them fruit trees turn fruitless; Their mere glance dries up a stream. The first verse teaches the general sufferings of the hungry ghosts, and the remaining verses teach the specific sufferings. \"Exhaustion\" refers to fatigue from running after food. \"Fear\" refers to the terror of seeing beings holding swords, clubs, and nooses. \"Garbage\" re-fers to unwanted trash. \"At night\" indicates that flames come out"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"172 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of their mouths nightly. \"Causes their mouths to blaze\" indicates that the food they eat causes their mouths to blaze. Some hungry ghosts' gazes will dry up even a sweet, cool stream, as though their eyes burned it with strong poison. The Clear Words: Explanation of the \"Friendly Letter\" explains298 that for some hungry ghosts a stream appears as if it were filled with a mass of blazing embers; for others it seems to be a flowing stream of pus filled with various insects. Also contemplate what Candragomin's Letter to a Student says:299 Tormented by a terrible thirst, they see a pure stream From afar and desire to drink it. When they arrive, It changes into a river filled with a mixture of oyster shells, Strands of hair, and putrid pus, a cesspool of blood and excre-ment. If they go to the top of a cool hill with moist spring breezes And a grove of verdant sandalwood trees, It becomes for them a forest fire enveloped in leaping flames And heaped with falling, burning logs. When they go to a seashore covered With clear, glittering foam from crashing waves, It becomes for them a wasteland Blasted by hot sand, dark mist, and a searing wind. Dwelling in that place, they long for rain clouds to appear, Whereupon there issues from the clouds a rain of iron arrows, Smoking cinders, and sparkling, diamond-hard boulders, And, one after the other, gold and orange lightning bolts fall on their bodies like rain. For those afflicted by heat even a snowstorm is hot; [128] For those tormented by wind even fire is cold. This entire universe appears upside down to these hungry ghosts Confused by the fruition of terrible karma. Even if one afflicted with a mouth the size of a mere needle's eye And a stomach of many leagues drinks the water of the great ocean, The water cannot pass through the opening of its throat And its poisonous mouth evaporates every drop. With regard to their life spans, the Levels of Yogic Deeds300 and Trea-sury of Knowledge301 say hungry ghosts endure for five hundred hun-gry ghost years, with each of their days being equivalent to a hu-man month. The Friendly Letter says:302"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Reflecting on Your Future Life 173 Some living beings, enduring continuous suffering, Bound tightly by the ropes Of the karma of wrongdoing, do not die For five thousand, or even ten thousand, years. The Clear Words: Explanation of the \"Friendly Letter\"303 explains that some hungry ghosts live five thousand and others ten thousand years. The Levels of Yogic Deeds says that the size of their bodies is not fixed in any of the three miserable realms-it varies in accor-dance with their nonvirtuous karma. Thus, when you contemplate these sufferings of the miserable realms, think like this: \"At present it is difficult to endure sitting for merely a single day with my hand stuck in burning coals, or to remain naked for that long in a cave of ice during the winter winds, or to go for a few days without food and drink, or for my body to be stung by a bee and the like. If even these are difficult to endure, how will I bear the sufferings of the hot hells, the cold hells, the hun-gry ghosts, or the animals devouring each other alive?\" After you have assessed your current condition, meditate until your mind is filled with fear and dread. Simply knowing about this without con-ditioning your mind to it, or only meditating on it for a little while, will not accomplish anything. The Bases of Discipline says:304 [129] The two sons of A.nanda's sister became monks and were made to learn to read. After reading for a few days, they became lazy and stopped. They were then entrusted to Maudgalyayana, but acted as before, so A.nanda told Maudgalyayana, \"You must make them renounce!\" Thus Maudgalyayana took them on a walk, and miraculously revealed a hell of living beings. When they heard the sounds of cutting, hacking, and other such actions, the two nephews went to investigate and witnessed the sufferings of being cut, etc. Since there were two great boiling kettles there, they asked whether someone would not be placed in them as well. The hell-guard-ians replied, \"A.nanda's two nephews have become monks and are wasting their time through their laziness; after they die, they will be reborn here.\" The two were terrified, and each thought, \"If I am smart, I will make an effort right now!\" They returned to where Maudgalyayana was and reported what had happened. Then Maudgalyayana said: \"0 novices, la-ziness gives rise to problems such as this and to others as well. You should have joyous perseverance!\" Hence, the two began to persevere enthusiastically. If they recalled hell prior to eating, they were unable to eat. If they recalled it after eating, they vomited."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"174 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Then Maudgalyayana took them on a different walk, where they heard from another direction the music of the deities' magic lutes and the like. When they went to investigate, they saw heav-enly palaces filled with goddesses, but no gods. When they asked why there were no gods, they were told, \" Ananda' s nephews have become monks and are persevering joyously; when they die, they will be reborn here.\" The two were delighted, and told Maud-galyayana, who said: \"0 novices, since this benefit, and others as well, arise from joyous perseverance, persevere joyously!\" They did so, and when they were receiving an explanation of the scriptures, they were taught from the authoritative scriptures that you can be reborn from the happy realms into the miserable realms, as cited previously. [130] When they heard this, they asked Maudgalyayana, \"0 noble being, must we also die as a deity or human, and then be reborn into the three miserable realms?\" He replied, \"0 youths, until you stop your afflictions, you must move like a water wheel throughout cyclic existence in its five realms.\" The two, after they had renounced cyclic existence, said, \"Hence-forth, we will not indulge in the afflictions; thus, please explain the teachings to us!\" Consequently, Maudgalyayana gave them the teachings, and they became arhats. Thus, meditation on suffering puts an end to laziness and gen-erates joyous perseverance at accomplishing the path. It spurs you toward liberation and is the root of the cause for attaining it. Since it was praised for this even when the Teacher was alive, he had noth-ing superior to teach as a personal instruction for liberation. This passage shows clearly the progression of the contemplations for persons of small and medium capacities. As for the measure of the attitudes of these two types of persons, you must constantly strive to meditate on these points until you develop an attitude like that of Ananda's nephews. Neu-sur-ba (sNe'u-zur-pa) said: Examine whether or not you have previously created the condi-tions for being born in these miserable realms, whether or not you are currently creating them, whether or not you would consider creating them in the future. Since you will go there if you have created them, are creating them, or would consider creating them, think, \"If I am born there, what will I do then; will I be able to do anything?\" With your head pounding, or like a man struggling in the desert, consider that there will be absolutely nothing you can do, and develop as much fear and dread as possible. This, clearly, is the key point. You currently have a good life for developing the path. Consequently, if you contemplate in this way,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Reflecting on Your Future Life 175 you will clear away previously accrued nonvirtuous karma and deter your future accumulations. Your prayers of fervent aspira-tion will redirect previously accrued virtues, causing them to in-crease. You will be able to enter many new avenues for engaging in virtuous actions. Therefore, you will make your leisure and op-portunity meaningful every day. [131] If you do not contemplate these things now, when you fall into a miserable realm, you will not find a refuge to protect you from these terrors even though you seek one. At that time, you will not have the intelligence to understand that which you should adopt and that which you should cast aside. As Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:305 If I neglect to cultivate virtue Even when I have the good fortune to do so, What shall I do when I am confused By the sufferings of the miserable realms? And also: Saying, \"Who will protect me From this great terror?\" I will stare, aghast, And search all around for a refuge. Seeing no refuge anywhere, I will be completely dejected. If there is no refuge there, What will I do? Thus, from today, I go for refuge To the Conqueror, protector of living beings, The one who strives to rescue living beings, The mighty one who dispels all fear.

The causes of going for refuge 2. Based on that, the objects to which you go for refuge 3. The way you go for refuge 4. Once you have gone for refuge, the stages of the precepts (Chapter 12) I' The causes of going for refuge In general there are many causes. However, for our purposes, the following apply. As previously explained, you cannot remain in this life-you soon die-and, after death, you have no control over where you will be reborn, for you are under the control of your karma. With regard to karma, Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:307 Just as a flash of lightning in a dark cloud Momentarily illuminates the darkness of a black night, [132] So too does there infrequently appear in the world, by a buddha's power, A few moments of intelligence to cultivate virtue. Thus virtue is always weak, And sin is fiercely powerful. Since virtuous karma is weak and nonvirtuous karma is exceed-ingly powerful, if you contemplate how readily you fall into the miserable realms, you will be filled with fear and dread, and will resolve to seek a refuge. As Mahatma Dignaga says:308 Adrift in the bottomless ocean of cyclic existence, Devoured by fierce sea monsters-Attachment and the like-To whom should I go for refuge today?"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Going for Refuge to the Three Jewels 179 In brief, the causes of your going for refuge are twofold: your fear of the miserable realms and the like, and your conviction that the three jewels can protect you from them. Thus, you must strive to realize these two causes, because if they remain mere words, so will your refuge, but if they are strong and stable, your refuge will transform your mind. 2' Based on that, the objects to which you go for refuge a\" Identifying the objects to which you go for refuge The Praise in One Hundred and Fifty Verses (Sata-paiicClSatka-stotra) saYS:309 The one in whom no fault Can ever exist, The one in whom all good qualities Always exist-If you are sensible, It is correct to go for refuge to just such a person, To praise and honor him, And to abide in his teaching. Thus, if you can distinguish a refuge from what is not a refuge, it is right to go for refuge to the Bhagavan Buddha, the true refuge. This citation applies to the teaching jewel and the community jewel as well. As Candrakirti's Seventy Verses on Refuge (Trisarafla-gamana-saptati) says:310 The Buddha, teaching, and community Are the refuge for those who desire liberation. b\" The reasons why they are worthy to be a refuge [133] There are four reasons why the Buddha is worthy to be a refuge. First, he has mastered himself and attained the sublime state of fear-lessness. If he had not attained this, he would not be able to protect others from all fears, just as a person who has already fallen down cannot help up someone else who has fallen down. Second, he is in all ways skilled in the means of training diSciples. If he were not so, he would not be able to fulfill your needs, even if you went to him for refuge. Third, he has great compassion. If he did not have it, he would not protect you even if you went to him for refuge. Fourth, he is pleased, not by material offerings, but by offerings of practice. If he were not, he would not act as a refuge for everyone, but would help only those who had previously helped him."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"180 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path In brief, only one who is free of all fears, who is skilled in the means of freeing others from fear, who has great, impartial com-passion for everyone, and who acts for everyone's welfare regard-less of whether or not they have benefited him, is worthy of being a refuge. Since only the Buddha has these qualities, and the divine creator and so on do not, he alone is the refuge. Therefore, his teach-ing and the community of his disciples are also worthy of being a refuge. Thus, after you have ascertained these things, which are taught in the Compendium ofDeterminations,311 entrust yourself to the three jewels with a single-pointed focus. Develop this certainty from the depths of your heart, for, once you are able to do this, they cannot fail to protect you. This is so because there are two causes of your being protected: an external and an internal. The Teacher has al-ready fully realized the external factor or cause, but you suffer be-cause you have not yet developed the internal factor, entrusting yourself to the refuge. Therefore, know that the Buddha, moved by his great compas-sion, assists you even if you do not request his help; that he is not lazy at this; and that he, the unrivaled and auspicious refuge, abides as your personal protector. [134] Recognizing this, go to him for refuge. The Praise in Honor of One Worthy of Honor (Van:Ulrha-var1Ja-stotra) says:312 He proclaims, /II am the friend Of you who have no protector./I Out of his great compassion, He abides as if embracing the entire world. a Teacher, you are so compassionate And caring, and strive to act Lovingly without laziness-Who else is like you? You are the protector of all living beings, The benefactor of everyone. Beings sink down because They do not seek your protection.

By refusing to acknowledge other refuges a\" Going for refuge by knowing the good qualities Since going for refuge by knowing the good qualities requires re-calling the good qualities of the refuge, there are three subdivisions of this topic: 1. The good qualities of the Buddha 2. The good qualities of the teaching 3. The good qualities of the community I\" The good qualities of the Buddha These are explained in four parts: 1. The good qualities of the Buddha's body 2. The good qualities of the Buddha's speech 3. The good qualities of the Buddha's mind 4. The good qualities of enlightened activities (a) The good qualities of the Buddha's body This entails recollection of the Buddha's auspicious signs and ex-emplary features. Recall them as they are taught in the Praise by Example (Upama-stava) [section of the Praise in Honor of One Worthy of Honor):314 Your body, adorned with the signs, Is beautiful, an elixir for the eye; It's like a cloudless autumn sky Decorated with clusters of stars. o golden Sage, Beautifully draped with religious robes-You are like a golden mountain peak Wrapped in the clouds of sunrise or sunset.

(b) The good qualities of the Buddha's speech Reflect on the marvelous manner of the Buddha's speech. Even if every living being in the universe asks him a different question at the same time, he comprehends them all with one instant of his wisdom. Then he answers all the questions with a single word, which all beings understand in their own languages. The Chapter of the Truth Speaker says:315 It is like this: if all living beings simultaneously Ask questions using many different expressions, He understands them in a single moment, And with a single utterance gives answers to each. Therefore, know that in the world the Leader Knows how to be eloquent. He turns the wheel of teaching That eradicates the suffering of deities and humans.

Again and again, it is like a sun Dispelling the darkness of ignorance. Since it razes the mountain of pride, It is also like the vajra. Because you see the truth, your speech never misleads; Since it is faultless, it is correct; Since it is well-composed, it is easy to understand. Your words are well-spoken. At first your speech Captivates the listeners' minds; Then if they give it thought, It clears away attachment and delusion. It relieves the destitute, Protects the unruly, And induces the reveler to renounce-Your speech accords with everyone's needs. It delights the learned, Improves the minds of the middling, And dispels the darkness of the lowly-This speech is medicine for all living beings. (c) The good qualities of the Buddha's mind These are explained in terms of the good qualities of knowledge and the good qualities of caring. (i) The good qualities of knowledge Without obstruction the Buddha's knowledge contacts the real nature and diversity of all phenomena, as if they were a dhatrl fruit317 placed in the palm of his hand. Thus, the Sage's knowledge com-prehends all phenomena, whereas others' limited knowledge can-not comprehend the vast objects that are to be known.

[137J (ii) The good qualities of caring In the same way that living beings are bound inescapably by the afflictions, so is the Sage bound by great compassion, which thus arises continuously as he beholds the suffering of living beings. You should reflect on this as set forth in the Praise in One Hundred and Fifty Verses:319 The afflictions bind all These beings without exception. You, in order to release them from the afflictions, Are eternally bound by compassion. Should I first make obeisance to you, Or to the great compassion that causes you To dwell for so long in cyclic existence Despite knowing its faults? Also, the Chapter of the Truth Speaker says:320 The Supreme Sage feels great compassion When he sees beings whose minds Are constantly obscured by the dark gloom of ignorance, Locked in the prison of cyclic existence. And also: The Conqueror feels great compassion when he sees beings Whose minds are overwhelmed by attachment, Who have great craving and always long for sensory objects, And who have fallen into the ocean of craving's attachment. The One Possessing the Ten Powers feels compassion Which seeks to dispel all suffering When he sees the afflictions of beings Harmed by a multitude of illnesses and miseries. The Sage's compassion arises constantly; It is impossible for it not to do so."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Going for Refuge to the Three Jewels 185 The Buddha is free of faults because he is concerned With the needs of all living beings. (d) The good qualities of enlightened activities The enlightened activities of the Buddha's body, speech, and mind, being both spontaneous and everlasting, help all living beings. If disciples are open to his guidance, the Sage will give them that which is excellent, and lead them out of trouble. [138] Thus, the Buddha's activities are certain to do everything that needs to be done. You should reflect on this as set forth in the Praise in One Hundred and Fifty Verses:321 You explain the destruction of afflictions, Reveal the deceitfulness of demons, Proclaim the terrifying nature of cyclic existence, And show the way to fearlessness. o Compassionate One, wishing to help, You act for the sake of living beings. How could there be something helpful Which you have not done? And the Praise in Honor of One Worthy of Honor says:322 What trouble is there away from which You cannot lead living beings? What excellent thing is there That you cannot bestow on the world? The preceding briefly summarizes the way to reflect on the Bud-dha. If you reflect in a variety of ways, your faith will also arise in many ways. The more you reflect, the stronger and more enduring your faith will become. The same applies to the good qualities of the other two jewels. When you have gained certainty by meditating in this way, you will understand that the scriptures and their commentaries are in-structions, in that most of them teach the good qualities of the three refuges. People who reject analytical meditation as a practice, think-ing that it is mere conceptualization, shut off many such ways of accumulating merit and clearing away obscuration. Therefore, be aware that such a rejection is a great obstacle to taking advantage of the boundless potential of a life of leisure and opportunity. The more you practice these things, the more accustomed your mind will become to them, and the easier it will be to practice what you had initially found difficult to learn. You will develop the spirit of enlightenment, thinking, \"I, too, should obtain buddhahood, like"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"186 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path the Buddha whom I recollect.\" You will have visions of the Bud-dha day and night. [139] No matter how much you suffer at death, you will not lose your recollection of the Buddha. The King of Con-centrations Satra says:323 I instruct you And you should understand: Peoples' minds become absorbed in something To the degree that they reflect on it. Therefore, recollect the Master of the Sages as having a conqueror's Physical posture and limitless sublime wisdom. If you constantly familiarize yourself with such recollection, Your mind will become absorbed in it-You will desire the sublime wisdom of a holy being Whether you walk, sit, stand, or recline. Because you yourself will want to become a supreme con-queror in the world, You will also make prayers aspiring to enlightenment. And also: Constantly give praise to the buddhas With your body, speech, and mind of clear faith. By conditioning your mind-stream in this way, You will see the Protector of the World day and night. Should you suffer the approach of death In sickness and sorrow, Your recollection of the Buddha will not be lost; It will not be erased by your suffering. Bo-do-wa said: If you reflect on the Buddha's good qualities again and again, you will receive a blessing commensurate with the strength of your faith and the purity of your mind. Because you have gained cer-tainty about them, you will go for refuge from the depths of your heart and train yourself in the precepts of refuge. Then everything you do will become a practice of the teaching. It is said that we value the Buddha's knowledge even less than that of an accurate diviner. If a reliable diviner says, \"I know that this year you will not face any problems,\" we are relieved. If he says, \"This year you will face problems-do this, and not that,\" we strive to follow his advice. If we do not, we think, \"I did not follow his advice,\" and worry. But when the Buddha says, \"You should give this up; you should practice this,\" do we commit"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Goingfor Refuge to the Three Jewels 187 ourselves to these injunctions? Do we worry if we do not follow them? [140] Or do we say, \"Well, the teaching says that, but right now, under the circumstances, I can't follow it-I must do this in-stead,\" and completely forsaking the Buddha's teaching, proceed straightaway with disregard, according to our own ideas? If you do not examine your mind, you will be pleased. If you are not misled by the superficial, look within your mind and reflect carefully, \"This condition is despicable.\" Thus, reflect again and again upon the good qualities of the Bud-dha, and strive to attain certainty from the depths of your heart. Once you gain this, you reach the very core of the practice of going for refuge, for you will gain certainty with respect to the teaching from which the Buddha arose, and the community that practices the teaching. Without this, there is no practice of going for refuge that transforms your mind, not to mention other paths. 2\" The good qualities of the teaching Once you have made respect for the Buddha your primary cause, you should then recollect the teaching jewel as follows: \"The Bud-dha possesses limitless good qualities, all of which arose from meditating on and realizing both the verbal teachings and the teach-ings as they are put into practice. That is, he actualized the true ces-sations, thereby eliminating faults, and meditated on the true paths, thereby giving rise to good qualities.\" The Compendium of the Teach-ings (Dharma-sa1!1glti) says:324 These bhagavan buddhas possess infinite and limitless good quali-ties. Such qualities are born from the teaching, from the proper practice of the teaching. The teaching creates and governs them. They arise from the teaching and are within the scope of the teach-ing. They depend upon the teaching, and the teaching produces them. 3\" The good qualities of the community Chief among the members of the community are those persons who are noble beings. Think of them in light of their mindfulness of the good qualities of the teaching and their proper practice of it. The Compendium of the Teachings:325 Think, liThe community teaches the teaching, practices it, and reflects on it. It is the teaching's sphere. It upholds the teaching, entrusts itself to the teaching, worships the teaching, and conducts itself according to the teaching.

It is naturally honest and pure. It is endowed with the quality of compassion, and has [great] compassion. It always has solitude as its field of activity, is always absorbed in the teaching, and always practices virtue.\" b\" Going for refuge by knowing the distinctions According to the Compendium of Determinations,326 you go for ref-uge after understanding the distinctions among the three jewels. 1\" The distinction based on their defining characteristics The buddha jewel has the defining characteristic of full, perfect enlightenment. The teaching jewel has the defining characteristic of arising from the buddha jewel. The community jewel has the defining characteristic of correct practice by means of personal in-struction. 2\" The distinction based on their enlightened activities Buddha has the enlightened activity of giving sermons. The teach-ing has the enlightened activity of focusing on the eradication of afflictions and suffering. The community has the enlightened ac-tivity of fostering enthusiasm. 3\" The distinction based on devotion You should appreciate the Buddha as the one to venerate and serve. You should appreciate the teaching as that which is to be realized. You should appreciate the community as those with whom you should associate because they have attributes that are similar to your own. 4\" The distinction based on practice You should worship and serve the Buddha. You should become familiar with the teaching by applying yourself to yoga. You should cultivate a relationship with the community through sharing the teaching and material goods. 5\" The distinction based on recollection You should recollect the good qualities of each of the three jewels by reciting \"Thus, the Bhagavan .... \"327 6\" The distinction based on how they increase merit Supreme merit is increased through the influence of either persons or the teaching. The Buddha and the community are instances of the former. Also, you can increase merit in dependence on either a"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Going for Refuge to the Three Jewels 189 single person or many persons. The community is a case of the lat-ter, because it requires four monks. [142] c\" Going for refuge through commitment According to Dharmamitra's Commentary on the \"Satra on the Disci-pline\" (Vinaya-satra-tika),328 going for refuge through commitment means upholding the Buddha as the teacher of refuge, the teach-ing-nirval).a-as the actual refuge, and the community as those who assist us to attain refuge. d\" Going for refuge by refusing to acknowledge other refuges Going for refuge by refusing to acknowledge other refuges means first of all understanding the differences in worth between Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachers, teachings, and disciples, for then you will uphold only the three jewels as your refuge, and refuse teach-ers, teachings, and disciples that do not accord with them. The dis-tinctions between the Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachers, etc. are as follows. The distinction of the teacher: The Buddha is without fault and has perfected good qualities, but the teachers of other religions are the opposite of this. Udbhatasiddhasvamin's Praise of the Exalted One (Vise~a-stava) says:329 Having forsaken other teachers, I go to you for refuge, 0 Bhagavan. If someone should ask why, it is because You have no faults and possess [all] good qualities. And also: The more I reflect on Other, non-Buddhist, traditions, The greater becomes My faith, 0 Protector. Their minds are ruined by the faults of tenets Devised by those who are not omniscient. Those whose minds are ruined Cannot even see you, faultless Teacher. The distinction of the teaching: The Conqueror's teaching allows you to attain its goal of bliss through a joyful path. It stops the stream of cyclic existence, clears away the afflictions, does not mislead those who desire liberation, is completely virtuous, and clears away faults. Non-Buddhist teachings are the opposite.

How they appear in the Compendium of Determinations 2. How they appear in the oral tradition a\" How they appear in the Compendium of Determinations332 Here the precepts are explained in two sets of subdivisions. 1\" The first set of subdivisions (a) Rely on excellent persons As previously explained, you rely on excellent teachers when you see them as the source of all good qualities, for you have already gone to the Buddha for refuge and thereby uphold the teacher of the path as your refuge. The practice that conforms with this is ac-tual reliance on the one who teaches the path to you."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Precepts of Refuge 193 (b) Listen to the sublime teachings, and (c) Fix your attention properly on them You should listen to whatever is appropriate among the sfltras and the like, teachings which are sublime because the Buddha and the Buddha's disciples explained them. In addition, fix your attention on whatever serves to dispel the afflictions, for you have already gone to the teaching for refuge and you have thus undertaken to actualize both the verbal teachings and the teachings as they are realized. The practice that conforms with this is listening to and fix-ing your attention properly on the sublime teachings. (d) Cultivate a practice that conforms with the teachings You should practice in accordance with the teachings on nirv<1l).a. When you have gone to the community for refuge, you have thereby taken as companions persons who are on the path to nirv<1l).a. [144] The practice that accords with this is training in the way of those who are intent upon liberation. 2\" The second set of subdivisions (a) Do not excite your sensory faculties When the sensory faculties draw the inattentive mind to objects, you should view this excitement with regard to sensory objects as a fault, and withdraw the mind from them. (b) Take up the precepts correctly You should take up the trainings set forth by the Buddha-as many as possible. (c) Be compassionate toward living beings The Conqueror's teaching is distinguished by compassion. There-fore, once you have gone to his teaching for refuge, you should also be compassionate toward living beings and forsake harming them. (d) Strive to make periodic offerings to the three jewels Each day you should make offerings to the three jewels. b\" How they appear in the oral tradition In the oral tradition, the precepts are divided into special precepts and general precepts. I\" The special precepts"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"194 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path These are explained in terms of proscriptive and prescriptive pre-cepts. (a) The proscriptive precepts The Great Final NirviiIJa SiUra states:333 Those who go to the three jewels for refuge Come closer to the truly virtuous; They never go To other deities for refuge. Those who go to the sublime teaching for refuge Harbor no harmful, murderous thoughts. Those who go to the community for refuge Do not associate with non-Buddhist philosophers. Thus, there are three proscriptive precepts: not going to other dei-ties for refuge, abandoning harm and malice toward living beings, and not befriending non-Buddhist philosophers. Not going to other deities for refuge is explained as follows: since you should not even hold worldly deities such as Rudra and Vh;mu as your ultimate refuge, what need be said about niigas and the lo-cal divinities who are hungry ghosts? While it is improper to en-trust yourself to these beings without full belief in the three refuges, it is proper to merely seek these beings' help for some temporary religious purpose, just as, for example, you would seek the help of a benefactor in acquiring the means of livelihood, or consult a doc-tor for the cure of an illness. [145] The second proscriptive precept entails refraining from doing harm or injury to living beings through thought or deed. This in-cludes actions such as beating, binding, imprisoning, nose-pierc-ing, and overburdening humans, animals, and so forth. The third proscriptive precept entails not agreeing with those who do not believe in the three jewels as a refuge and who repudiate them. (b) The prescriptive precepts There are three prescriptive precepts. The first is to treat images of the Buddha as objects of reverence-as though they were the Teacher himself-not pointing out their faults regardless of their quality, and not disrespecting them or treating them with contempt by putting them in dishonorable places, pawning them, etc. The Friendly Letter:334 Just as the learned worship an image of the Sugata, Whatever it is made of, even wood ..."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Precepts of Refuge 195 The Exegesis of the DisciplinÂ£i335 relates how Manavakapila, who slan-dered the community of learners and those with no more to learn in eighteen different ways-saying, for example, \"What do you know of the teaching or nonteaching, Elephant-head?\"-was reborn as a monstrous fish with eighteen different heads, remaining an ani-mal from the time of Teacher Kasyapa until the time of the King of the Sakyas [the Buddha]. The The K?udraka Bases of Discipline (Vinaya-k?udraka-vastu)336 relates how, after the nirval).a of Teacher Krakucchanda, King Carumat ordered that a great stupa be built. A workman cursed it twice, exclaiming, \"We'll never be able to com-plete a stupa this huge!\" Later, when it was nicely finished, he re-gretted his curses and used his wages to have a golden bell fash-ioned and placed on the stupa. [146] As a result, he was reborn as Supriyavat (\"Sweet Voice\"), with an ugly complexion and tiny body, but a beautiful voice. Thus, you should never quibble over the qual-ity of images, despise others for using fine materials for images and the like or for making them large, discourage their makers from fin-ishing them, and the like. It is said that the great yogi [Chang-chup-rin-chen] once gave a statue of Manjugho~a to the Elder for him to examine. He asked, \"How good is this? If it is good, I will buy it with the four gold coins Rong-ba-gar-gay-wa (Rong-pa-mgar-dge-ba) gave me.\" The Elder replied, \"Venerable Manjugho~a's body has no defects-the sculp-tor is middling,\" and placed it on his head. It is said that he did the same with respect to all finished images. The second prescriptive precept is never to show disrespect for writings on the teachings, even those composed of as little as four words. Further, you should not pawn volumes of scriptures, treat them as merchandise, place them on the bare ground or in dishon-orable places, carry them together with shoes, walk over them, etc. Treat them with respect, as though they were the teaching jewel itself. It is said that whenever Geshe Jen-nga-wa saw a scripture being carried, he would stand up with his hands joined together in front of him in a gesture of respect. In later life, when he was un-able to rise, he would simply join his hands. Also, it is said that the Elder once encountered a mantra practitioner in Nga-ri who ini-tially refused to listen to him teach. However, one day the Elder witnessed a scribe rubbing a page of the teaching with plaque from his teeth. Unable to bear this, he cried out, \"Hey! Don't do that, don't do that!\" -as a result of which the mantra practitioner gained faith in the Elder and received the teaching from him. Furthermore, Sha-ra-wa said: \"We are playing around with the teaching in so many"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"196 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path ways. Showing disrespect for the teaching and its teachers ruins our wisdom. We are stupid enough now-let's not create more stu-pidity! If we become even more stupid, what will we be able to do?\" The third prescriptive precept is never to revile or despise mem-bers of the community, renunciates, or those who merely possess the symbols of a practitioner of virtue [someone who is dressed as a monk or nun but has no vow]. Nor should you do this to the mere symbols [part of the robes] of these practitioners. Never in any way divide yourself and others into opposing factions and view the oth-ers as enemies. [147] Always treat members of the community with respect, as though they were the community jewel itself. The Exhortation to Wholehearted Resolve says:337 Those dwelling in the forest, desiring good qualities, Should not scrutinize others' faults. They should not think, \"I am superior; I am the best\"-Such arrogance is the root of all unruliness. Do not despise inferior monks, Or you will not achieve liberation for an eon. Such is the way of this teaching. We should train ourselves to practice like the Precious Teacher [Drom-don-ba] and Nal-jor-ba-chen-bo, who, if they saw a mere scrap of yellow cloth on the path, would not step on it, but would dust it off and carry it to a clean place. For, as much as we respect the three jewels, so will living beings respect us. The King of Con-centrations Sidra:338 You will obtain a result similar To the kinds of karma you do. 2\" The general precepts There are six general precepts: 1. By recalling the distinctions and good qualities of the three jewels, go for refuge again and again 2. By recalling the great kindness of the three jewels, strive to worship them constantly and offer the first portion of your food and drink 3. Establish other living beings in this practice by consider-ing them with compassion 4. Whatever activity you engage in, and whatever your pur-pose, make offerings and supplications to the three jew-els, forsaking any other worldly methods"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The Precepts of Refuge 197 5. After you have understood the benefits, go for refuge three times in the day and three times at night 6. Maintain your refuge and do not forsake the three jewels, even in jest or if it costs you your life (a) By recalling the distinctions and good qualities of the three jewels, go for refuge again and again As previously explained, you should repeatedly keep in mind the differences between non-Buddhists and Buddhists, the distinctions among the three jewels, and the good qualities of the three jewels. (b) By recalling the great kindness of the three jewels, strive to worship them constantly and offer the first portion of your food and drink. The King of Concentrations Sutra:339 Though they obtain food due to the buddhas' merit, The childish do not repay their kindness. Thus, knowing that all the temporary happiness and certain good-ness that you experience, symbolized by food, are due to the kind-ness of the three jewels, you should make offerings with the inten-tion of repaying their kindness. With regard to offerings, there are (1) the actions of offering and (2) the attitudes. The first of these include the following ten types: [148] 1) Offerings to the Buddha's body means offerings to the ac-tual Buddha's embodiment as form. 2) Offerings to stupas means offerings to stupas and the like for the sake of the Buddha. 3) Offerings to a perceived object means offerings to the above-mentioned two as they are manifest to your own sensory fac-ulties. 4) Offerings to a nonperceived object refers to offerings made to a buddha or his stupas that are not actually present, and made for the sake of all buddhas and stupas. Offerings made for the sake of the Buddha to one or more images and stupas after his nirvat:la are also considered offerings to a nonperceived object. When you make offerings to either an unperceived buddha or his unperceived stupas, you are also making offerings to both of the perceived objects, for the reality or emptiness of one of them is the reality of all of them. It is standard to make offer-ings, both to perceived and to nonperceived objects, with the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"198 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path thought, \"I make offerings to all the buddhas of the three times and to the st11pas of the ten directions of the limitless universe.\" It is said that making offerings to a percieved object produces a vast store of merit and making offerings to an unperceived object a greater store; making offerings to all the buddhas and st11pas produces a store far more vast than that. Thus, it is im-portant that when you make offerings to a single buddha or his image, and the like, you recollect the indivisibility of real-ity and project the thought that you are making offerings to all of them. 5) Offerings made by yourself are offerings made manually by yourself. Do not have others make them for you out of your laziness, indifference, or carelessness. 6) Offerings that you help others to make refers to offerings that you, out of compassion, cause someone else to make. This oc-curs when you have some small things to offer and you think, \"These suffering living beings, who have little merit and noth-ing to give, will gain happiness by making these offerings.\" Furthermore, the merit of offerings made both by yourself and by others you have helped to make offerings are shared by both of you, the difference in the size of the meritorious re-sults of these three being similar to the above discussion in the fourth section. [149] 7) Offerings of weal th and service are offerings to a buddha or his st11pa consisting of gifts of clothing, food, bedding, seats, medicine, personal necessities, incense, aromatic powders and ointments, flower garlands, music, and various types of lamps. There is also offering respectful speech, prostrations, rising before the other, hands joined together respectfully, a variety of praises, obeisance with your limbs and head touching the ground, and clockwise circumambulation. Moreover, inex-haustible gifts such as fields can be given, as well as offerings of jewels, earrings, bracelets, and the like. At the least, there are offerings of bells, silver coins, or spools of thread. 8) Vast offerings means offerings of the above wealth and ser-vice over a long duration. Furthermore, they have seven quali-ties: being copious, excellent, both perceived and nonperceived, done by both oneself and others, and being offered with heart-felt delight, fervent aspiration, and with the merit being dedi-cated to perfect enlightenment. 9) Offerings not contaminated with the afflictions are offerings with six qualities: they are made (1) manually by yourself, not"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Precepts of Refuge 199 making others do them out of contempt, carelessness, or lazi-ness; (2) respectfully; (3) without distraction; (4) free of the af-flictions in that they are not mixed with attachment and the like; (5) without expectation of receiving wealth and service from kings and so on who have faith in the Buddha; and (6) with proper material accompaniments. Proper material accom-paniments include whatever is free of inappropriate things, as well as proper acts such as anointing something with bala (ba-bla) medicinal ointment, soaking something in clarified butter, burning a fragrant gugul resin, offering white arka flow-ers, and so forth. If you have neither prepared these offering materials yourself nor requested them from others, you should delight in all the appropriate offerings to the tathiigatas that exist throughout the universe, imagine them to be vast and pervasive, and rejoice in others offering them. [150] Having made this great, measureless offering, you will, with little dif-ficulty, amass the accumulations necessary for attaining en-lightenment. Strive constantly to do this with a contented, happy mind. As it says in the Cloud of Jewels Satra and the Array of the Three Pledges (Tri-samaya-vyaha),340 you can also give unowned flowers, fruit, trees, jewels, and the like. 10) Offerings of practice entail recollecting the four immeasur-ables, the fourfold condensation of the teaching [(1) all com-posite phenomena are impermanent, (2) all contaminated things are miserable, (3) all phenomena are selfless, and (4) nirvc\"u.).a is bliss and peace], the three refuges, and the perfec-tions; admiring profound emptiness and fixing on it without conceptualization; disciplining your mind through the vows of ethical discipline; and meditating on and striving for the factors of enlightenment, the perfections, and the four ways to gather disciples, all for at least as long as it takes to milk a cow [ten to fifteen minutes]. To make these ten types of offerings to the three jewels is to make a complete offering. The second aspect of offerings, the attitudes, is as follows. When you make these ten types of offerings, there are six attitudes that will render immeasurable the result of even a small offering to any of the three jewels. You should make offerings with the thoughts that (1) there is no higher field of good qualities; (2) there is no higher benefactor; (3) he is the best of all living beings;"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"200 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (4) he is extremely rare, like an udumvara flower;341 (5) since only one buddha appears in a universe of three bil-lion world systems, he is the only one; and (6) he is the foundation of all mundane and supramundane good. I have written about these ten types of offerings and six attitudes as they appear in the Bodhisattva Levels.342 You should always make the best offering you can. Make espe-cially good offerings on auspicious occasions and holidays, to the best of your ability. Furthermore, since you constantly have to eat and drink, always offer the first portion of your food and drink. [151] If you do this without fail, you will easily amass a large accu-mulation of merit. Thus, from the depths of your heart, always of-fer the first portion of whatever you consume, even water. Further, Sha-ra-wa stated: Do not offer things such as moldy sweet cheese and yellowed leaves, but use what you have that is good. Offering the first por-tion of tea will not be beneficial if it is done like the clearing away of some dust. A sutra says: For example, it will not work just to put seeds on a fertile field without actually planting them in season. So it is appropriate continuously to plant the seeds of temporary happiness and cer-tain goodness throughout the four seasons in the fertile field that gives rise to all temporary happiness and certain goodness in this and future lives-but you till this field with the plow of faith. If you do not do this, you will be extremely poor in merit. Hence, as the Praise in Honor of One Worthy of Honor says:343 No field of merit like you Exists in the three worlds-You are the supreme recipient of gifts, The pure one who makes a row of monks pure. Just as the height and breadth Of the firmament have no limit, There is no limit to the fruition Of helping or harming you. Since our practice is such that we cannot even think of a supreme field of merit as we would an ordinary field, we should always strive to make offerings to the three jewels. By doing so our mind's"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Precepts of Refuge 201 power with respect to the stages of the path will increase as a re-sult of the strength of the roots of virtue grown in this excellent field of merit. Therefore, when our mind's power is so weak that we cannot retain the words when we study, understand the meaning when we reflect, or gain knowledge when we meditate, we should rely on the power of the field of merit. This is a personal instruc-tion. In this vein, Sri Matrceta also says:344 By depending on you, [Bhagavan,] My mind, though weak, has broadened Like a river in the rainy season, Attaining great skill in composing poetry. [152] It is taught that offerings are not determined by the material objects offered, but by your faith. Thus, if you do not have material possessions to offer, then offerings of maJ).<;lalas and water, or of things not held as property and the like, will suffice if you have faith. Some have possessions but are unable to give them up, quoting the verse,345 \"As I have no merit, I am very poor; I have no other wealth for offerings.\" This is, as Bo-do-wa said, like a blind person trying to fool a sighted person by dropping a bit of sod incense into a smelly conch cup and saying, \"This is water scented with sandal-wood and camphor.\" Pu-chung-wa said, \"First I gave sod incense with a sharp odor. Next I obtained sweet-smelling, long sticks of incense made from four substances to give. Now I give aromatic akaru, turu?ka, and the like.\" Thus, if you despise small offerings and do not give them, your en-tire life will pass in that way. However, if you make earnest effort in stages, beginning with small things, conditions will improve. You should practice as Pu-chung-wa did. It is said that on one occasion he made a preparation of incense worth twenty-two gold coins. Great beings who have gained control over material things ema-nate many hundreds of thousands of bodies, each of which in tum emanates hundreds of thousands of hands. Visiting all the buddha-realms, they make offerings to the Conquerors for many eons. They can do all this, while others settle for small achievements that look good, and say, \"1 do not expect enlightenment through making offer-ings.\" This is the nonsense of those who have little exposure to the teaching. Thus, we should do as it says in the Cloud of Jewels SiUra:346 Study any of the vast offerings and acts of service in the slltras such as these. With supreme wholehearted resolve, sincerely dedi-cate these offerings and acts of service before the buddhas and bodhisattvas."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"202 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (c) Establish other living beings in this practice by considering them with compassion [153] This means that you should use all available means to caringly es-tablish other living beings in the practice of going for refuge.

The sublime teaching is also inconceivable. The noble community is inconceivable. For those having faith in the inconceivable The fruition is also inconceivable. Also, Aryasura's Compendium of the Perfections (Paramita-samasa) states:348 If the merit of going for refuge took form, Even these three realms would be too small to contain it-A cupped hand cannot measure The great ocean, the storehouse of water.

(b') The second set of four (1') You will have great protection This will be explained later. (2') You will reduce, extinguish, and totally annihilate all obscurations derived from incorrect belief You will reduce and clear away bad karma accumulated on account of your believing in bad teachers, teachings, and friends and up-holding them as refuges.

Because he or she has gone for refuge and has become stable in it, he or she will be our companion.\" (ii) The benefits as they appear in personal instructions As explained in the personal instructions, the benefits of going for refuge are eight in number. (a') You are included among Buddhists In general, there are a number of ways to distinguish Buddhists from non-Buddhists. However, since it is widely acknowledged that the Elder and Santipa distinguish them according to the refuges they"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"204 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path seek, you should count as Buddhists those who have obtained and not forsaken their refuge. Thus, to initially be included among Bud-dhists you must uphold the three jewels as your teacher and so forth from the depths of your heart. Without this you are not included among Buddhists, no matter what virtue you have cultivated. (b') You become worthy to uphold all vows The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary says:350 Those who go for refuge enter the door leading to the taking of all vows. Also, Candrakirti's Seventy Verses on Refuge says:351 o lay practitioners, going for refuge to the three jewels is the ba-sis for the eight VOWS.352 [155] The intended meaning of these passages is that you make your aspiration for nirval)a firm by going for refuge, and that your vows arise from this. (c') You reduce and eliminate previously accumulated karmic obstructions In the section where it teaches that going for refuge clears away sins, the Compendium of Trainings says:353 Here you should take the edifying tale of the pig as an example. Thus, just as the god who was about to be reborn as a pig avoided such a birth by going for refuge, so too do you eliminate the condi-tion for rebirth in a miserable realm by going for refuge. Conse-quently, it is said: Those who go for refuge to the Buddha Do not go to miserable realms. After giving up human form, They assume the bodies of deities. The same teaching applies to taking refuge in the teaching and the community: some previously accumulated sins are reduced, and some are eliminated.

Such refuges are not the foremost; Such refuges are not supreme. If you rely on such a refuge, You will not be freed from all suffering. When you go for refuge to the Buddha, The teaching, and the community, You will see with wisdom The four noble truths-Suffering, the origin of suffering, Correctly overcoming suffering, And the happy eightfold noble path Leading to nirvaDa. This is the foremost refuge; This is the supreme refuge. If you rely on such a refuge, You will be freed from all suffering. Here you should use as examples the stories about the non-Bud-dhist who mastered the magic rope, and so forth.355 [156] (g') You will accomplish everything you wish If, before undertaking a religious activity, you make offerings to the three jewels, go for refuge, and then pray to succeed, you will eas-ily accomplish it. (h') You will quickly achieve buddhahood The Sidra Requested by a Lion (Silrlha-parip!cchii-sl1tra) says:356 Through faith you overcome a lack of leisure. Thus, one who obtains a special kind of leisure, encounters the ref-uge, and trains in the special path will achieve buddhahood with-out delay. Each day, recall the benefits in the above manner. Then go for refuge three times during the day and three times during the night. (f) Maintain your refuge and do not forsake the three jewels, even in jest or if it costs you your life"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"206 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Inevitably you will lose your body, life, and resources. But, if you forsake the three jewels for the sake of these, you will suffer con-tinually throughout many lives. Thus, you should repeatedly vow that whatever happens you will not forsake your refuge-not even mouthing the words in jest. Former teachers have said that there is a precept that you should practice going for refuge to the tathagata of whichever direction you are going in. I have not seen a source for this. I have presented the six general precepts in accordance with how they appear in Atisha's Commentary on the Difficult Points of the \"Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment.\" The first three of the special precepts are explained in the sfltras, the other three in Vimalamitra's Six Aspects of Goingfor Refuge (Sa~-aizga-sara1Ja-gamana):357 An image, verse, or Discarded scrap of yellow cloth: Out of faith and belief, consider it to be the Teacher; Do not mistakenly deny anything he has said, Rather place it on the crown of your head; View pure and impure persons As though they were noble. [157] With respect to the precepts drawn from the Compendium of Deter-minations,358 the sayings of Ga-ma-pa state, \"Neu-sur-ba did not teach these [precepts of going for refuge], but he and I received them together from Gon-ba-wa.\" They appear in the presentation of the stages of the path transmitted from Gon-ba-wa through Lum-ba-wa (Lum-pa-ba). How contravening these precepts causes weakening and forsak-ing of your refuge is explained as follows. Some assert that if you violate six of the precepts-the first three special precepts, plus the precepts of constantly going for refuge, not forsaking refuge even for the sake of your life, and making offerings to the three jewels-you have given up your refuge. Others include the last three spe-cial precepts and assert that contravention of nine precepts consti-tutes forsaking refuge. Contravention of the remaining precepts weakens your refuge. However, an actual forsaking of refuge means that you have contravened the precept not to forsake refuge even for the sake of your life. Similarly, even if you do not forsake the three jewels, if you follow both them and a teacher, teaching, and community that are contrary to them, you contravene the precept not to acknowl-edge other refuges. Since you are not fully entrusting yourself to"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Precepts of Refuge 207 the refuge, you have forsaken it. I think that if these two do not occur, other contraventions of the precepts are just contraventions, but not causes of forsaking refuge. This being the case, going for refuge is the main door to the Buddha's teaching. If you go for refuge in a way that transcends mere words, you will not be defeated by outer and inner obstacles, for you are relying upon the highest power. Since good qualities develop easily and deteriorate with difficulty, they can only con-tinue to increase. Therefore, it is extremely important, as previously explained, to uphold the refuges by means of fearing suffering, recalling the good qualities of the refuges, and so forth, and to make an effort not to transgress the precepts. Question: Thus when you generate fear through mindfulness of death and the thought that, after death, you will be reborn in a mis-erable realm, the refuge that protects you from this is the three jew-els. You uphold them as your refuge and do not contravene their precepts. Nonetheless, how do the refuges protect you? Reply: The Collection of Indicative Verses states:359 I, the Tathagata, the Teacher, Reveal to you The path that stops the pains of existence; You must follow it. [158] Thus, the Buddha is the one who teaches refuge, and the commu-nity assists you in accomplishing refuge, but the real refuge is the jewel of the teaching, because once you have attained it, you are liberated from fear. With regard to this, the ultimate teaching jewel is defined as being the special fulfillment of the gradual increase of two things-the beginning practitioner's elimination of a mere portion of faults, and his or her knowledge that brings about a mere portion of good qualities.

The actual way in which to reflect in general (Chapter 13) 2. Reflecting on the distinctions among the varieties of karma (Chapter 14) a\" The actual way in which to reflect in general In general, the actual way to reflect on karma and its effects entails four points: 1. The certainty of karma 2. The magnification of karma 3. Not experiencing the effects of actions that you did not do 4. That the actions you have done do not perish 1\" The certainty of karma All happiness in the sense of feelings of ease-whether of ordinary or noble beings, including even the slightest pleasures such as the rising of a cool breeze for a being born in a hell-arises from previ-ously accumulated virtuous karma. It is impossible for happiness to arise from nonvirtuous karma. All sufferings in the sense of painful feelings-including even the slightest suffering occurring in an arhat's mind-stream-arise from previously accumulated nonvirtuous karma. [159] It is im-possible for suffering to arise from virtuous karma. The Precious Garland:362 From nonvirtues come all sufferings And likewise, all miserable realms. From virtues come all happy realms And the joys in all rebirths. Consequently, happiness and suffering do not occur in the absence of causes, nor do they arise from incompatible causes such as a divine creator or a primal essence.363 Rather, happiness and suffer-ing, in general, come from virtuous and nonvirtuous karma, and"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The General Characteristics of Karma 211 the various particular happinesses and sufferings arise individu-ally, without even the slightest confusion, from various particular instances of these two kinds of karma. Attaining certain knowledge of the definiteness, or nondeceptiveness, of karma and its effects is called the correct viewpoint for all Buddhists and is praised as the foundation of all virtue. 2\" The magnification of karma An effect of immense happiness may arise from even a small virtu-ous karma. An effect of immense suffering may arise from even a tiny nonvirtuous karma. Hence, internal [karmic] causation seems to involve a magnification that is not found in external causation. Moreover, it is said in the Collection of Indicative Verses:364 Like a poison that has been ingested, The commission of even a small sin Creates in your lives hereafter Great fear and a terrible downfall. As when grain ripens into a bounty, Even the creation of small merit Leads in lives hereafter to great happiness And will be immensely meaningful as well. Become certain about how great effects may arise from small actions by studying the narratives of past events presented in texts such as the Bases of Discipline, the Satra of the Wise and the Foolish (Dama-murkha-sutra),365 and the Hundred Actions Sutra (Karma-sataka-siUra). For example, there are the stories from the Bases ofDiscipline366 about the herdsman Nanda and the frog beaten by his staff, the goose, the fish, the five hundred tortoises, the five hundred hun-gry ghosts, the farmer, and the five hundred bulls, and, from the Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish, the accounts of Suvarr:tadevata, Suvarr:tavasu, and Hastipala. [160] Furthermore, there are those who have partially lapsed in these four things-ethical discipline, rituals, livelihood, and philosophi-cal view. That is, they have not at all lapsed in the latter, but have not completely accomplished pure forms of the former three. The Buddha said that such people will be born as nagas. The Questions of the Naga Kings of the Ocean (Sagara-naga-raja-pariprccha) says:367 \"Bhagavan, in the beginning of the eon I lived in the great ocean and the tathagata Krakucchanda was in the world. At that time, the nagas and their sons and daughters within the great ocean had become few and even I had a reduced retinue. Now, Bhagavan,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"212 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path the niigas and their sons and daughters within the great ocean are immeasurable and their numbers know no limit. 0 Bhagavan, what are the causes and conditions for this?\" And the Bhagavan said: \"0 Lord of Niigas, there have been those who renounced the world and went forth into the disci-pline-the well-spoken teaching-but who did not completely perfect the pure ethical discipline. They were not completely per-fect in that their rituals had deteriorated, their livelihood had de-teriorated, and their ethical discipline had deteriorated. Still, their view was straight. They were not born among the living beings of the hells. They were, upon their death, reborn in the places where niigas are born. Further, it is said that during the continuation of the teaching of Teacher Krakucchanda, nine hundred and eighty million house-holders and renunciates were born as nagas on account of their lapsed rituals, livelihood, and ethical discipline. During the con-tinuation of the teaching of Teacher Kanakamuni, there were six hundred and forty million. During the continuation of the teach-ing of Teacher Kasyapa, there were eight hundred million. During the continuation of the teaching of our own Teacher, nine hundred and ninety million have been or will be reborn as niigas. Even since our own teacher passed into nirva1).a, those of the four types of fol-lowers who commit sins and whose ethical discipline lapses are reborn as nagas. [161] Nonetheless, it is said that, although their practice is not pure, upon their death as niigas and transference to a new life they are reborn as deities or humans through the power of their unlapsed conviction in the teaching. Except for those who entered the Mahayana, all of them will pass into nirva1).a during the teachings of those who will become buddhas in this auspicious eon. Therefore, solidify the certainty that even the subtlest of virtu-ous and nonvirtuous actions follow you like shadows and produce both great happiness and great suffering. Then, strive to cultivate even the subtlest of virtues and to eliminate even the subtlest of sins and infractions. The Collection of Indicative Verses:368 Just as the shadows of birds who dwell In the sky move along with them, Beings are followed by What right and what wrong they have done.

And also: Do not scorn even the tiniest sin, Thinking that it will do no harm; It is through the accumulation of drops of water That a great vessel gradually fills. And further: Do not think that the commission Of even a tiny sin will not pursue you. Just as a large vessel is filled By falling drops of water, So too is a fool filled up with sins Accumulated a little at a time.

Again, the Garland of Birth Stories:369 By accustoming themselves to virtuous and nonvirtuous karma Humans become habituated to these actions. Though you may ignore such matters, In other lives you will experience their effects, like a dream. [162] Those who do not train in generosity, ethical discipline, and the like May have good family lineages, good bodies, and health, And may have great power or enormous wealth, But they will not find happiness in future lives.

Which should I adopt and which should I cast aside? Reply: In general, you can conclude that there are three ways to engage in good and bad conduct-physically, verbally, and men-tally. Although not all the virtues and nonvirtues of these three ways are included within the ten paths of action, still the Buddha, the Bhagavan, summarizing the key points, taught the most obvious, or coarse, among the virtues and nonvirtues as being the ten paths of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions. He taught that the extremely great foundations for a misdeed are the ten paths of nonvirtuous action. He saw that when you give up these ten, you adopt virtu-ous actions and that the most important points of these virtuous actions are also ten in number. Therefore he taught ten paths of virtuous action. The Treasury of Knowledge:373 Systematizing the most obvious among them, The Buddha said that the paths of action-Virtuous or nonvirtuous-are ten. And the Exegesis of the Discipline says:374 If you practice these three paths of action-Guarding your speech, being restrained mentally, And not committing physical nonvirtues-You will achieve the path taught by the Sage. Knowing the ten paths of nonvirtuous actions and their effects, re-strain yourself from even being motivated to commit them. Then practice the paths of action of the ten virtues in which your body, speech, and mind are not at all mixed with the paths of nonvirtuous action. This practice is indispensable as the basis for all three vehicles as well as for the accomplishment of the two aims of beings. Hence, the Conqueror repeatedly praised it from many perspectives."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 217 The Questions of the Naga Kings of the Ocean states:375 What I have called virtues are the taproots of the perfections of all deities and humans. They are the taproots of the enlightenment of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. They are the taproots of the un-excelled, perfect enlightenment. And what are these taproots? They are the ten virtuous actions. [164] And also: For example, 0 Lord of Nagas, all villages, cities, municipalities, districts, countries, and kings' palaces; all grass, bushes, medici-nal herbs, and trees; all fruits of labor, all stocks of seeds, the growth of all harvests, their plowing, harrowing, and produc-tion-everything rests on the earth. Their source is the earth. Like-wise, 0 Lord of Nagas, these paths of the ten virtuous actions are the sources of divine or human birth, of attaining the goal of the virtuous practices of learners and those with no more to learn, of the enlightenment of a pratyekabuddha, of all the bodhisattva deeds, and of all the qualities of a buddha. Therefore Candrakirti, in the Commentary on the\" Middle Way,\" sum-marized the significance of the Buddha's praise in the Sutra on the Ten Levels (Dasabhiimika-siUra) for the ethical discipline in which you eliminate the ten nonvirtues:376 For ordinary beings, those born from the Buddha's speech, Those whose natures are certain as self-enlightened, or con-querors' children, There are no causes of certain goodness Or high status, apart from ethical discipline. Repeatedly guard your ethical discipline by maintaining a sense of restraint. There are some who have no such restraint even with regard to a single practice of ethical discipline, yet still say, \"I am a practitioner of the Mahayana.\" This is very dishonorable. The Sutra of K~itigarbha states:377 By means of these ten paths of virtue you will become a buddha. However, there are those who, for as long as they live, do not even minimally maintain even a single path of virtuous action, but who say such things as, \"I am a Mahayana practitioner; I seek unex-celled, perfect enlightenment.\" Such people are great hypocrites and liars. They deceive the world in the presence of all the bhagavan buddhas, and they preach nihilism. When they die, they seem confused and they fall back. [165] You should understand \"falling back\" to be a synonym for taking a completely miserable rebirth."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"218 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 2\" The determination of the effects of actions There are three parts to the determination of the effects of actions: 1. Nonvirtuous actions and their effects 2. Virtuous actions and their effects 3. A presentation of other classifications of karma (a) Nonvirtuous actions and their effects These are explained in three parts: 1. The actual paths of nonvirtuous actions 2. Distinctions of weight 3. An exposition of the effects (i) The actual paths of non virtuous actions The ten paths of nonvirtuous actions are as follows: 1. Killing What is killing? The Compendium of Determinations teaches this in five categories-basis, perception, attitude, affliction, and conclu-sion. However, you can condense the middle three into the category of attitude and add the category of performance to give a condensed presentation of each of the paths of action in four categories-ba-sis, attitude, performance, and culmination.378 Such a presentation is easy to understand, and there is no contradiction between it and the intention in Asanga's teaching. Among these, the basis of killing is a being who is alive. More-over, the Levels of Yogic Deeds379 adds the qualification \"other,\" as in \"another living being.\" This is in consideration of cases of suicide, and when there is a sin of commission that lacks culmination.380 Concerning the three aspects of attitude---perception, motivation, and affliction-perception has four types: (1) perceiving a living being (the basis) to be a living being; (2) perceiving a living being not to be a living being; (3) perceiving what is not a living being not to be a living being; (4) perceiving what is not a living being to be a living being. The first and third perceptions are accurate, whereas the second and fourth are mistaken. In some cases, there may be a specific motivation. For example, someone may plan to kill only someone called Devadatta, and he or she then commits murder. However, if this person mistakes"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 219 Yajnadatta for Devadatta and kills him instead, there is no actual sin.381 Hence, such an action of killing requires an accurate percep-tion. If at the time of performance the killer has a general motiva-tion, thinking that no matter what happens he or she will kill, an accurate perception is not necessary. Know this to be the case for any of the remaining nine non virtuous actions. The affliction is any of the three mental poisons, and the motiva-tion is the desire to kill. [166] As for the performance, it makes no difference whether the performers do it themselves or cause some-one else to do it. The nature of the performance is killing by way of a weapon, poison, a spell, or the like. The culmination is the death of another on account of the per-formance, either at that point in time or at another point in time. Further, the Treasury of Knowledge says:382 If the killer dies prior to or at the same time as the victim There is no actual infraction, since the killer has then assumed another life. I concur. 2. Stealing The basis of stealing is anything owned by another. Among the three aspects of attitude, the perception and the af-fliction are the same as above. The motivation is the desire to take the thing from another person even though he or she has not given it to you. As for the performance, the performer is as before. The nature of the performance in the act of stealing is either robbing by force or theft by subterfuge-they are equivalent. Further, whether people engage in deceit about debts and trusts, or take what is not given by other deceitful means, and whether they act for the sake of their own interests or others' interests, or to harm another-these are all equally considered stealing. As for the culmination, the Compendium of Determinations says,383 \"moving it to another location.\" While there are many cases that are incompatible with the meaning of this passage, moving the thing from its original place to another is merely an illustration. In the case of things such as fields, moving it is not possible, yet you must be able to posit a culmination. Therefore, in such a case the culmi-nation is thinking that you have acquired it. Further, if you cause another to rob or cause them to steal, it is enough that the other person has that thought. This is like the case in which someone is"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"220 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path killed without your knowledge, but by some person whom you have sent. When the victim dies, the one who caused the murderer to kill incurs an actual sin. 3. Sexual Misconduct There are four possible bases of sexual misconduct: a person with whom you should not have intercourse, inappropriate body parts, inappropriate places, and inappropriate times. Those with whom one should not have intercourse in the case of men are women with whom you should not copulate, all men, and eunuchs. The Compendium of Determinations refers to the first;384 [167] Those indicated in the sutras-such as your mother and those protected by mothers-are \"those with whom you should not have intercourse.\" The meaning of this is as the scholar Asvagho1?a said:385 \"Those with whom you should not copulate\" Are those held by another, those having a religious insignia, Those under the protection of family or king, A prostitute who has been taken by another, And those related to you-These are the ones with whom you should not copulate. \"Those held by another\" are others' wives. \"Those who have a re-ligious insignia\" are renunciate women. \"Those protected by fam-ily\" are those who have not yet become brides and are protected by kinsfolk such as their fathers, who are protected by a father-in-law or a mother-in-law, who are protected by a guard, or who-in the absence of these-are protected even by themselves. \"Those pro-tected by a king\" or his representative are those concerning whom a punitive law has been laid down. The line stating that sex with a prostitute for whom another has paid is sexual misconduct shows that there is no sexual misconduct in hiring a prostitute yourself. The Great Elder also taught this in a similar way. \"Men,\" the second in the list of those with whom you should not have intercourse, refers both to oneself and to others. Inappropriate body parts are body parts other than the vagina. The master Asvagho~a says: What are inappropriate body parts? The mouth, the anus, the calves or Thighs pressed together, and the hand in motion. This accords with what the Great Elder says:386"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Varieties a/Karma 221 The \"inappropriate body parts\" are the mouth, the anus, the front or rear orifices of a boy or girl, and your own hand. Inappropriate places are areas such as the vicinity of gurus, for in-stance; a place where there is a stupa; in the presence of many people; and on uneven or hard places that are harmful to the person with whom you are having intercourse. The Master Asvagho~a says:387 In this case, inappropriate places Are ones that are locations of the sublime teaching, Stupas, images, and the like, and bodhisattvas; And the vicinity of an abbot, a preceptor, or one's parents. Do not have intercourse in these inappropriate places. [168] The Great Elder also taught this. Inappropriate times are when the woman is menstruating, when she is at the end of a term of pregnancy, when she has an infant who is nursing, when she is observing a one-day vow, and when she has an illness which makes sexual intercourse inappropriate. Sexual intercourse is also inappropriate in excess of a proper amount. A proper amount is having intercourse up to five times a night. The master Asvagho~a says:388 In that case, inappropriate times are when A woman is menstruating, pregnant, Has an infant, is unwilling, Is in pain or is unhappy and the like, Or is maintaining the eight-part one-day vow. Again, the Great Elder is similar to Asvagho~a with the difference that he says that daytime is an inappropriate time. Given that the three bases-sexual intercourse using inappropri-ate body parts, in an inappropriate place, or at an inappropriate time-become sexual misconduct even in regard to your own wife, it is certainly the case that they become sexual misconduct in re-gard to others. Of the three aspects of the category of attitude-perception, motivation, and affliction-perception is spoken of in the Compen-dium of Determinations and in the texts on discipline. The Compen-dium of Determinations389 says that the \"perception of this as that\" must be accurate. However, the Buddha says in the texts on disci-pline that in the case of the cardinal transgression of unchastity, it is the same whether the perception is mistaken or accurate. The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentarif90 explains that if you have approached another's wife with the perception that she is your"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"222 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path own wife, then this does not become an actual path of nonvirtuous action. Vasubandhu presents two systems in regard to when inter-course under the perception that another person's wife is the wife of a third person-one in which intercourse becomes a path of non-virtuous action and one in which it does not. The affliction is any of the three mental poisons. The motivation is the desire, due to unchastity, to copulate. As for the performance, the Compendium ofDeterminations391 states that even in terms of caus-ing others to commit sexual misconduct, the instigator of such an action incurs the misdeed of sexual misconduct as well. However, the Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary392 explains that such in-stigation is not an actual path of action. You should examine whether Asari.ga's explanation may mean that such instigation is a fault which is not an actual path of action. The culmination is the sexual union of the two parts. 4. Lying [169] The eight bases of lying are that seen, that heard, that distinguished, and that cognized, as well as the four opposites of these [that not seen, etc.]. Lying is when someone else-the recipient of the lie-comprehends the meaning of the lie. Of the three aspects of the category of attitude-perception, af-fliction, and motivation-perception includes misrepresenting a perception, such as what you have seen, as something you have not seen, or misrepresenting what you have not seen as something you have seen. The afflictions are the three mental poisons. The motivation is your desire to misrepresent your perception. The performance is indicating something through speaking, through choosing not to speak, or through gesture. Further, in terms of the purpose, it is said to be the same whether you speak for your own purposes or for the sake of others. In this case it is said that even causing others to engage in the three types of speech-lying, divisive speech, or offensive speech-is the same as doing it your-self. Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge and Auto-commentary393 ex-plain that all four vocal nonvirtues constitute paths of action when you cause others to do them. The texts on discipline say that you yourself must speak in order to incur a full infraction. The culmination of a lie is someone else's comprehension. The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary explains that if no one com-prehends the words, then speaking them is simply the nonvirtu-ous action of senseless speech. Divisive speech and offensive speech are similar in this respect."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 223 5. Divisive Speech The bases of divisive speech are living beings who are compatible or incompatible. Of the three aspects of the category of attitude, the perception and the affliction are as before. The motivation is the desire that living beings who are compatible be separated or the desire that living beings who are incompatible remain so. The performance is the expression of subject matter that may be either pleasant or unpleasant, and may be either true or false. You may speak of these matters either for your own or for another's purpose. The culmination is the other's understanding of the divisive words that have been spoken. As the Compendium of Determinations says,394 \"The end of this path of action is when those who are to be divided understand the divisive words.\" 6. Offensive Speech The basis of offensive speech is a living being in whom you can engender hostility. Of the three aspects of the category of attitude, the perception and the afflictions are as before. The motivation is the desire to speak in an offensive manner. [170] The performance is saying something unpleasant, which may be either true or false, about the deficiencies of someone else's family lineage, body, ethical discipline, or behavior. As for the culmination, the Compendium of Determinations says,395 \"The end is speaking in an offensive manner to that person.\" The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary explains the meaning of this to be that the person to whom the offensive speech is spoken must understand it. 7. Senseless Speech The basis of senseless speech is speech about a topic that is not meaningful. Of the three aspects of the attitude, the perception is as follows. Although Asanga says nothing more than\" a perception of that as that,\" here senseless speech means that you yourself per-ceive the topic about which you wish to speak and then speak. It does not have to involve someone else who understands it. The affliction is any of the three. The motivation is the desire to make arbitrary, unconnected remarks. The performance is to un-dertake the speaking of senseless speech. The culmination is hav-ing finished an utterance of senseless speech. Furthermore, senseless speech has seven bases: (1) speaking of fighting, faultfinding, disputes, and divisions;"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"224 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (2) speech such as transmitting and reciting texts with a mind that delights in the treatises of non-Buddhists or in the mantra vehicle of brahmins; (3) expressions of helplessness, such as wailing; (4) speaking of laughter, play, entertainment, or enjoyment; (5) talking about news of commotion, such as news of kings, ministers, nations, and thieves; (6) speaking like a drunkard or a lunatic; (7) the talk of one who maintains a wrong livelihood. Disjointed, irreligious, and senseless speech is speech that is jumbled, reveals the afflictions, or is uttered while laughing, sing-ing, or viewing actors and the like. There are two systems with regard to the first three vocal faults-one asserts that they are senseless speech and one that they are not. However, what I have stated here is in line with the former. S. Covetousness The bases of covetousness are the wealth or possessions of another. Of the three aspects of the attitude, the perception is perceiving the basis to be what it is. [171] The affliction is any among the three. The motivation is the desire to make the wealth or property your own. The performance is striving at that contemplated purpose. The culmination is thinking \"May it become mine,\" about wealth and the like. Asanga describes this as \"the determination that it will become yours.\" For this to be full-fledged covetousness, five quali-ties are required: (1) having a mind that is exceedingly attached to your own resources; (2) having a mind of attachment that wants to accumulate resources; (3) having a mind of longing due to comprehending or ex-periencing the good things of others-their wealth and so forth; (4) having an envious mind, thinking that whatever is another's should be your own; (5) having a mind that is overcome, due to covetousness, by shamelessness and an obliviousness about the determina-tion to be free from the faults of covetousness. If anyone of these five minds is not present, there is no actual covetousness. The Levels of Yogic Deeds says to apply these five to all ten nonvirtues."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 225 As for the manner in which an action might constitute covetous-ness that is not full-fledged, it is such covetousness when you give rise to the following desires: (1) the thought, \"Oh, how nice it would be if the master of the house were to become my servant and things could be however I would wish them\"; (2) also such a thought with regard to his wife and children, etc. and his physical possessions such as food and so forth; (3) the thought, \"Oh, how nice it would be if others knew me to have such good qualities as being dispassionate, re-tiring, persevering, learned, and generous\"; (4) the thought, \"How nice it would be if kings and minis-ters and the four types of followers of the Buddha were to respect me and if I were to obtain such necessities as food and clothing\"; (5) developing desire, thinking, \"Oh, may I be reborn in the future as a deity and enjoy the deities' five sensory objects, and may I be reborn from the worlds of the fierce ones and Vi~l)u, as a deity in the Heaven of Controlling Others' Emanations [the highest of the six divine regions of the desire realm]\"; [172] (6) developing desire for the possessions of parents, children, servants and the like, or the possessions of your fellow re-ligious practitioners. 9. Malice The basis, perception, and afflictions are the same as in the case of offensive speech. The motivation is the desire to do such things as strike others, thinking such thoughts as, \"How nice it would be if they were killed, or bound, or their resources were ruined, either naturally or by another person.\" The performance is having that thought. The culmination is a determination or decision to do things such as beating. Moreover, it is complete if the following five attitudes are present, and incom-plete if they are not. The five are: (1) an attitude of hostility driven by a reifying apprehension of the characteristics of the causes of harm and the phe-nomena related to them; (2) an impatient attitude by way of not being patient with those doing the harm to you;"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"226 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (3) a resentful attitude based on repeated, improper atten-tion to and mindfulness of the causes of your anger; (4) an envious attitude which thinks, \"How nice if my en-emy were beaten or killed\"; (5) an attitude that is dominated by a lack of shame about your malice and obliviousness about the determination to be free of its faults. Attitudes of simple malice are as follows. To the extent that you reflect, \"Someone has harmed me or is harming me,\" and think about how to bring harm to whoever is doing or did the harm-all this is malice. Other examples of simple malice are the wish that someone else's relatives, resources, or virtue, etc. might deteriorate in this lifetime and the wish that someone else might go to a miser-able realm in a future lifetime. 10. Wrong Views The bases of wrong views are existent objects. Of the three aspects of the attitude, the perception is perceiving to be true the meaning of a mistaken denial of the existence of an existent object. The af-fliction is any of the three mental poisons. The motivation is the desire to deny the existence of an existent object. The performance is the initiation of that attitude. [173] Moreover, there are four types of such performance: mistaken denial of causes, effects, activities, and existent entities. Mistaken denial of causes is thinking that right or wrong behavior do not exist, and so forth. Mistaken denial of effects is thinking that the fruitions of these sorts of behavior do not exist. Mistaken denial of activity is of three types: (1) Mistaken denial of the activities of planting and retaining seeds is thinking that there are no fathers and mothers. (2) Mistaken denial of the activities of going and coming is thinking that there are no former and future lives. (3) Mistaken denial of the activity of birth is thinking that living beings cannot have spontaneous birth. The fourth type of performance of wrong view, mistaken denial of existent entities, is thinking that arhats and such do not exist. The culmination is the certainty that you have denied something. A full-fledged wrong view is associated with these five attitudes: (1) an attitude of confusion due to not knowing objects of knowledge exactly; (2) a violent attitude, due to delighting in sins;"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 227 (3) an attitude that continuously operates in the wrong way because of pondering improper teachings; (4) an attitude that is impaired because of a mistaken denial that thinks that such things as gifts, religious offerings, burnt offerings, and right behavior do not exist; (5) an attitude that is dominated, due to these wrong views, by shamelessness and obliviousness about the determina-tion to be free of its faults. If these five are not present, a wrong view is not full-fledged. Although it is certainly the case that there are other wrong views, only this is called \"wrong view,\" for it is the greatest of all wrong views in that it is through this wrong view that you sever all your roots of virtue. Further, it is this wrong view that is conducive to your doing whatever sins you want. With respect to these ten nonvirtues, you may undertake killing, offensive speech, and malice with any of the three mental poisons, but you bring them to culmination with hostility. You may under-take stealing, sexual misconduct, and covetousness with any of the three mental poisons, but you bring them to culmination only with attachment. As for lying, divisive speech, and senseless speech, you may both undertake them and bring them to culmination with any of the three mental poisons. You may undertake wrong view with any of the three mental poisons, but you bring it to culmination only with delusion. [174] Among these ten, intentions are actions (Skt. karma), yet they are not paths of action (Skt. karma-patha). The seven nonvirtuous ac-tions of body and speech are not only actions but are also paths of action because body and speech are the bases of the intended op-eration. The three mental nonvirtues---covetousness and so on-are paths of action but are not actions. (ii) Distinctions of weight Distinctions of weight are explained in two parts: 1. The weights of the ten paths of nonvirtuous action 2. The criteria for powerful actions (a') The weights of the ten paths of nonvirtuous action There are five causes that make an action weighty. As exemplified by killing, they are as follows. Actions of killing that are weighty due to attitude are those done with intense forms of the three men-tal poisons."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"228 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Killing that is weighty due to performance includes: (1) killing with a mind delighting in and being glad about having taken life, taking life, or taking life in the future; (2) engaging in the action yourself, causing others to take it up, and praising it; (3) doing it with a mind that is pleased when such a thing is seen, and doing it after prolonged premeditation and preparation; (4) doing it constantly and diligently, and each time killing a great deal; (5) killing your victim by torture; (6) killing after frightening your victim into performing in-appropriate actions; (7) killing while your victim is weak, suffering, or impover-ished, or while the victim is moaning, or piteously recit-ing laments. A killing that is weighty due to the absence of an antidote is one that is done: (1) while not taking any precepts on a daily basis; (2) while not doing such things as observing one-day vows on the new moon, or on the eighth, fourteenth, or fifteenth days of the month; while not occasionally being generous, collecting merit, speaking about the teaching, making obei-sance, rising when a respected person enters your pres-ence, pressing your palms together in respect, or having an attitude of veneration; (3) while not from time to time becoming ashamed, embar-rassed, or having a preponderance of contrition; (4) while not having reached either a state of freedom from worldly attachment or clear knowledge of the teaching. Killing that is weighty due to clinging to the perverse is that done in reliance on any sort of wrong view. [175] For example, there are those who kill out of a desire to be religious, relying on the views of those who make animal sacrifices. They think that there is no fault in slaughtering livestock because the Lord of All Beings cre-ated them to be used. Killing that is weighty due to its basis is taking the life of a large animal, a human, a fetus, your parents, your aunt or uncle, some-one such as a guru, a close friend, a learner, a bodhisattva, an ar-hat, or a pratyekabuddha. Also, it is killing which is weighty due to"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 229 its basis when you know that a tathagata cannot be killed, and you bring forth blood from a buddha with an intention to harm. Killing that is done with the opposite of these five causes is a light killing. You should understand that the weight of the remaining nine nonvirtuous actions is similar to killing, except for the bases, which are as follows. Stealing is weighty due to its basis if it in-volves taking a great deal, or taking good things; or is stealing af-ter deceiving those who trust you; or stealing from the lowly, the impoverished, renunciates, or other Buddhist practitioners; or in-volves stealing what is highly valued; or stealing the property of learners, arhats, pratyekabuddhas, the community, or stupas. Sexual misconduct that is weighty due to its basis is sleeping with those whom you should not have intercourse with-your mother, those who are her relatives, the wives of men who are close friends, nuns, probationary nuns, or female novices. In terms of an inap-propriate body part, sexual misconduct that is weighty due to its basis is oral intercourse. In terms of improper time, it is intercourse with one observing a one-day vow, a pregnant woman at the end of term, or one who is ill. In terms of an inappropriate place, it is intercourse in the vicinity of a stilpa or within the compound of the community. Lying that is weighty due to its basis is, through desiring to de-lude and deceive, telling lies with many purposes; telling lies to those who have helped you-from parents through the buddhas, to good persons, and to friends; and telling a lie that gives rise to one or more of the three weighty actions-killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Telling a lie in order to split apart the commu-nity is the weightiest among all of these. [176] Divisive speech that is weighty due to its basis is speech that splits apart those who have been friends for a long time, teachers, par-ents, parents and their children, or the community; and divisive speech that gives rise to weighty actions-the three physical actions. Offensive speech that is weighty due to its basis is speaking of-fensive words to parents and the like, or to someone like a guru; speaking offensive words with untrue and inaccurate lies; and di-rectly scolding, criticizing, or reproaching. Senseless speech that is weighty due to its basis is as follows. The weight of the senseless speech of the three other nonvirtuous vocal actions-lying, and so forth-is as above. Other actions of sense-less speech that are weighty due to their bases include senseless words based on fighting, faultfinding, disputes, and divisions; such activities as reading the treatises of non-Buddhists with an attitude"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"230 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of attachment; and ridiculing, taunting, or speaking inappropriately toward parents, kinspeople, and someone like a guru. Covetousness that is weighty due to its basis includes desiring the offerings made to the community and stiipas; and with arrogance about your own good qualities, desiring to receive, from kings and the like or from learned religious companions, profit and services for your knowledge. Malice that is weighty due to its basis includes malice directed toward parents, kinspeople, gurus, those without fault, the poor, the suffering, the pitiful, and those who have done something wrong to you but confess this to you from the depths of their hearts. Wrong views that are weighty due to their bases are the rejec-tion of all the fundamental religious tenets (this is weightier even than other wrong views) and also the view that in the world there are neither arhats, those who have reached reality, nor those who have entered reality. Understand wrong views that are the oppo-site of these to be light. The Levels of Yogic Deeds speaks of six ways in which actions are weighty:396 (1) conditioning-actions motivated by intense forms of the three mental poisons or by their absence; (2) habituation-frequently doing or becoming used to and deeply involved in either virtuous or non virtuous actions for a long time; [177J (3) nature-in that among the three physical and four vocal actions the former ones are weightier than the ones after them, and among the three mental actions the latter are weightier than the former; (4) basis-actions that help or harm those like the Buddha, the teaching, the community, and gurus; (5) fixation on incompatible factors-for as long as you live you completely take up nonvirtuous actions and do not cultivate virtue even once; (6) eradication of unfavorable factors-having eliminated the group of nonvirtues, you become free from attachment and cultivate virtuous actions. The Friendly Letter says:397 The five types of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions Arising out of persistence, obsession, a lack of remedy, And the principal foundations of virtue Are huge; among them, strive to cultivate virtue."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 231 That is, there are five types because the \"principal foundations of virtue\" are divided into foundations that have virtues-such as the three jewels-and foundations who provide assistance, such as your parents. (h') A brief discussion of the criteria for powerful actions The strength of actions is explained in terms of four aspects: recipi-ent, support, objects, and attitude. (1') Strength in terms of recipient There is strength in actions directed toward the three jewels, gu-rus, those who are like gurus, parents, and the like, for, though you direct no intense thoughts toward them and do them only small harm or help, the ensuing misdeed and merit is great. Further, the Mindfulness of the Excellent Teaching states:398 Even if you take something small from the Buddha, the teaching, or the community, the fault will be large. However, if you offer some similar substance that is greater than what you stole from them, you will clear away the karma of stealing from the Buddha and the teaching. However, there is no clearing away the karma of stealing from the community without experiencing the result, because of the weightiness of the recipient. If you have stolen something that is the means for sustenance of the community, you will fall to rebirth as a living being in a great hell. [178] If you have stolen something that is not the means for their sustenance, you will be reborn within that region, in a hell surrounding the Unrelenting Hell such as the Hell of Great Black Darkness. In particular, if those who do not care about their ethical discipline were to use material of the community-merely a leaf, flower, or piece of fruit-they would be reborn as a living being in a great hell. After a long time, they would be free of this hell. However, they would then be reborn in a dry and barren wilderness as animals with no hands or legs, or as blind hungry ghosts without hands or legs. They would then experience suffering for many years. The Sun Essence Sidra (Surya-garbha-sutra) mentions great dangers such as these. Moreover, the Buddha said that you cannot even use something such as a flower dedicated to the community or to a monk. Fur-ther, you may not give it to a householder, and for a householder to use it is unsuitable. Also, the misdeed is very great. The Sun Es-sence Sutra states:399"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"232 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Do not give to householders What has been dedicated to the spiritual communities-It would be better to cut off your own limbs With sharp razors. Those outside of the community Should not use things from within it-It would be better to eat a lump of iron Like a blazing tongue of fire. Those who are householders Are not to use things of the community-It would be better to take up and eat A fire akin to the size of Mount Meru. Those who are householders Should not use the community's things-It would be better to be disemboweled And hoisted upon a stake. Householders should not spend a night In a dwelling of the community-It would be better to enter A house full of burning embers. Within the community, persons who are bodhisattvas are ex-tremely powerful recipients in terms of activities that are either virtuous or nonvirtuous. The Seal of Engaging in Developing the Power of Faith Sidra (Sraddha-baladhitnavatara-mudra-slltra)400 says that it is an immeasurably greater sin for someone to become angry and tum his or her back on a bodhisattva, saying, \"I will not look upon this evil person,\" than for someone to become angry and put all the liv-ing beings in the ten directions into a gloomy prison. [179] Further, it states401 that if someone were to despise any bodhisattva, it would be a sin immeasurably greater than that of someone stealing all the belongings of all the living beings in Jambudvipa. Again, it says that if someone were to have malice or anger for a bodhisattva, who delights in the Mahayana, and speak disagreeably to such a bodhisattva, it would be a sin immeasurably greater than that of someone who demolishes or burns as many st11pas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. Further, the Seal of Engaging in Certain and Uncertain Destinies S11tra (Niyataniyata-mudravatara-slltra) speaks402 of someone who looks with faith upon a bodhisattva (who delights in the Mahayana) and who, wanting to look with clear faith upon such a bodhisat-tva, speaks praises of him or her. This person would accumulate"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 233 merit that is immeasurably greater than that of someone who lov-ingly gives eyes to all the living beings of the ten directions after they all have lost their eyes, and frees such living beings from in-carceration, establishing them in the bliss of a universal monarch or Brahma. Again, the Sidra on the Magic of Final Peace (Prasanta-viniscaya-pratiharya-siitra)403 speaks of someone who does as little as obstruct a bodhisattva's virtuous action of giving a single closed handful of food to an animal. Such a person commits a sin immeasurably greater than someone who kills all the living beings in Jambudvipa, or steals all of their belongings. Therefore, take this subject very seriously. (2') Strength in terms of support Although even a small lump of iron sinks to the bottom of a body of water, the same substance made into a vessel, even a large one, floats on top. Likewise, the Buddha said, sins committed by those who are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable are heavy and light as well. The Great Final NirvalJa Siitra states the rea-son for this:404 Just as a fly that is stuck to nasal mucus cannot extricate itself, so the ignorant cannot extricate themselves from even small short-comings. Further, they cannot do virtuous actions, because they are without regret. Even though they have previous virtuous ac-tions, they defile them with sins, because they hide their faults. The causes of experiencing a fruition of a nonvirtue in the present lifetime are therefore transformed into causes of great suffering and become causes for experiencing a very severe hell. [180] This is similar to the way in which if a handful of salt is put in a little water, the water becomes hard to drink, or to the way in which a person who borrows a gold coin from another but can-not repay it falls deeply in debt and suffers. Further, in five ways even light causes of fruitions in the present will ripen in a hell: being ignorant, having small roots of virtue, having weighty sins, not having been regretful and per-formed a purification, and not initially cultivating virtue. Therefore, the Buddha said that nonvirtues are light for the knowl-edgeable who regret their former nonvirtuous actions, restrain themselves from future nonvirtuous actions, do not conceal their sins, and do virtuous actions as remedies for those nonvirtuous actions. However, nonvirtues are weighty for those who make a pre-tense of being knowledgeable and do not do these actions but be-little them and engage consciously in nonvirtuous action."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"234 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path The Heap of Jewels Sutra (Ratna-rasi-sutra)405 speaks of a bodhisat-tva who has renounced the householder's life holding a lamp wick coated with a trifling amount of butter in front of a stupa. The merit accumulated from this is then compared to all the living beings in the universe of three billion world systems having entered the Mahayana, possessing the kingdom of a universal monarch, and then each making offerings to a stupa of the Buddha with butter lamps whose vessels were the size of an ocean and whose wicks were the size of Mount Meru. It states that even this would not match even a hundredth of the former's merit. This is a case in which the attitude-the spirit of enlightenment-and the recipi-ent-the stupa-are not different, but there is a pronounced differ-ence in the object offered. However, this is clearly a case exempli-fying strength in terms of the support [vow]. Following the line of reasoning in this passage, it is evident that, regarding cultivation of the path by someone without the support of a vow, someone having a vow, and, within having a vow, the support of possessing one, two, or three vows, the latter will have quicker progress than the former. It is clear as well that when people such as household-ers practice such things as generosity, there can be a great differ-ence in the strength of the roots of virtue produced. This difference comes from whether they act within having a vow such as a one-day vow or whether they act without a vow. [181] The Sutra on Overcoming Faulty Ethical Discipline (Du~sila-nigrahaÂ­sutra)406 speaks of a monk who does not observe ethical discipline but who drapes himself in the flag of a sage [monk's robe].407 The nonvirtue that such a monk incurs when he enjoys for a single day what a donor has given with faith is far greater than the sins a hu-man being possessing the ten nonvirtues would accumulate con-tinuously over a hundred years. The Buddha is saying that this is a case of the strength of sin from the viewpoint of the support. Also, the Exegesis of the Discipline speaks of both those who have faulty ethical diScipline and those who have slackened from their precepts:408 For those who have faulty ethical discipline Or who are not correctly restrained It is far better to eat iron lumps blazing with flames Than to eat the alms of their region. One of the sayings of the Precious Teacher Drom-d6n-ba states that compared to sins that are related to the teaching, the sins of the ten nonvirtues are insignificant.

Among offerings to the buddhas, the offering of practice is vastly superior to the offering of material things. Following these examples, understand the others. (4') Strength in terms of attitude The Heap of Jewels Sutra409 mentions all of the living beings in the universe of three billion world systems each making a stiipa of the Buddha as large as Mount Meru, and each paying reverence to it in all their actions for ten million eons. It says that far greater than the merit from that is the merit in a bodhisattva's throwing just a single flower toward a stiipa with an attitude that is imbued with a desire to attain omniscience. Understand that, in the same manner, there are variations in the amount of merit you accumulate from the perspective of differences in attitude such as focusing on superior or inferior goals, or focusing on your own or others' interests. The amount varies as well from the perspective of the strength or weak-ness of your attitude, whether it is brief or long-lasting, and so on. With regard to wrongdoing, afflicted attitudes that are strong and long-lasting have greater strength and, among these, hatred is very powerful. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:410 All the good behavior-Generosity, offering to the sugatas and the like-Amassed for a thousand eons [182] Is destroyed by a single moment of hatred. Anger, moreover, toward spiritual companions and, even more, toward conquerors' children is very weighty. The King of Concen-trations Sutra:411 When people have malice toward each other, Learning and ethical discipline cannot protect them from its fruition, Concentration does not protect them, nor can living in solitude; Generosity does not protect them, nor does offering to the buddhas.

Therefore, there are three fruitional effects for each action. In the Levels of Yogic Deeds413 it says that through each of the great forms of the ten nonvirtues-killing and so forth-you will be reborn in the hells, through each of the ten medium forms you will be reborn as a hungry ghost, and through each of the ten small forms you will be reborn as an animal. The Sutra on the Ten Levels, however, speaks of the effects for the small and medium forms in reverse. (b') Causally concordant effects Even when you are reborn from the miserable realms as a human, [you still experience the effects of nonvirtuous actions] as follows: [as a causally concordant effect of killing,] a short lifetime; [as an effect of stealing,] a lack of resources; [from sexual misconduct,] an unruly spouse; [from lying,] much slander; [from divisive speech,] loss of friendships; [from offensive speech,] hearing unpleasant words; [from senseless speech,] others not listening to your words; and [from covetousness, malice, and wrong views] respec-tively, predominance of attachment, hostility, and confusion. The Chapter of the Truth Speakey414 and Sutra on the Ten Levels both state that each of the nonvirtuous actions has two effects. They say that even if you are born a human, still: [as a result of killing] you would have a short life span and many illnesses; [as a result of stealing] you would have few resources and the resources you do have would be shared with others; [as a result of sexual misconduct] your helpers would be dis-orderly or untrustworthy, and you would have a conten-tious spouse; [as a result of lying] others would slander you a great deal, and they would deceive you; [as a result of divisive speech] your helpers would not get along and would misbehave; [as a result of offensive speech] you would hear unpleasant and quarrelsome speech; [183]"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 237 [as a result of senseless speech] your words would not be re-spected or understandable, and your confidence would not be unshakable; [as a result of covetousness] you would have great attach-ment and no contentment; [as a result of malice] you would seek the unbeneficial or not seek the beneficial, and you would harm others or others would harm you; [as a result of wrong views] you would have bad views and would be deceitful. The former gurus assert that liking to kill and so on even once you have been born a human are causally concordant behavioral effects, and the above-mentioned effects are causally concordant experi-ential effects. (c') Environmental effects From the non virtuous action of killing, such things in the external environment as food and drink, medicine, and fruits will have little strength, be ineffective, have little potency and power, or, being difficult to digest, will induce illness. Hence, most living beings will die without living out their expected life spans. The environmen-tal effects of stealing are that you will have few fruits, the fruits will not be perfect, will change, or will be partially spoiled. There will be severe droughts or torrential downpours. The fruits will dry up or disappear. The environmental effects of sexual misconduct are living where there is excrement and urine, mud, filth, unclean things, many evil smells, misery, and discomfort. The environmental effects of lying are that any work that you do in fields or on boats will not flourish; there will be no harmony among your workers, and for the most part they will be deceitful; and you will be fearful and have many causes to be afraid. The en-vironmental effects of divisive speech are that you will be in a place that is bumpy, craggy, uneven, and difficult to traverse; and you will be fearful and have many causes to be afraid. The environmen-tal effects of offensive speech are that you will be in a place that is full of logs, thorns, large rocks, sharp stones, and many broken bricks; that lacks waterfalls, lakes, or ponds; is rough, drab, arid, salty, barren, vile, and is a place of dangerous animals; [184] and you will have many causes to be afraid. The environmental effects of senseless speech are that you will be in a place where fruit trees do not bear fruit, bear fruit at the wrong time, or bear no fruit at the proper time; the unripened appear to be ripe; the roots are not strong;"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"238 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path the tree does not last long; there are not many comforts such as parks, groves, and pools; and you will have many reasons to be afraid. The environmental effects of covetousness are that all excellent things will deteriorate and diminish every year, every season, month, and even each day, and will not increase. The environmen-tal effects of malice are that you will be where there are epidemics, injury, and infectious diseases; quarrels, and many disputes with opponents' armies; lions, tigers, and the like; poisonous snakes, scorpions, and many fireflies; and harmful yak$as, robbers, and the like. The environmental effects of wrong views are that you will be in an environment where the best and principal sources of resources will disappear; where unclean things will appear to be most pure, and misery will appear to be bliss; and where you will have no home, protector, or refuge. (b) Virtuous actions and their effects (i) Virtuous actions The Levels a/Yogic Deeds says that virtuous actions include the physi-cal actions of those who reflect on the faults of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct and have a virtuous attitude. They have also carried out the performance of correctly restraining themselves from these nonvirtuous actions and have brought this restraint to cul-mination. It states that the same can be said for the four vocal ac-tions and the three mental actions, the difference being to substi-tute \"vocal actions\" and \"mental actions\" for \"physical actions.\" Therefore, apply to each of the ten actions the four aspects of basis, attitude, performance, and culmination. This is illustrated in the following example of the path of action of giving up killing. [185] The basis of giving up killing is another living being. The attitude is seeing killing's faults and desiring to give it up. The performance is the activity of having correctly restrained yourself from the kill-ing. The culmination is the physical action of completing the cor-rect restraint. Understand the others in this way as well. (ii) The effects of virtuous actions There are three types of effects-fruitional, causally concordant, and environmental. The fruitional effect is that you are born as a hu-man, a deity of the desire realm, or a deity in one of the two upper realms through small, medium, and great virtuous actions, respec-tively. You should take the causally concordant and environmen-tal effects to be the opposite of those of the nonvirtuous actions."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 239 The Sutra on the Ten Levels says41S that those who have cultivated these ten through fear of cyclic existence and without [great] com-passion, but following the words of others, will achieve the fruit of a sravaka. There are those who are without [great] compassion or dependency on others, and who wish to become buddhas them-selves. When they have practiced the ten virtuous actions through understanding dependent-arising, they will achieve the state of a pratyekabuddha. When those with an expansive attitude cultivate these ten through [great] compassion, skillful means, great aspira-tional prayers, in no way abandoning any living being, and focus-ing on the extremely vast and sublime wisdom of a buddha, they will achieve the level of a bodhisattva and all the perfections. Through practicing these activities a great deal on all occasions they will achieve all the qualities of a buddha. Thus, I have explained the two sets of ten paths of action along with their effects. I have explained everything that is unclear in other texts in accordance with the intended meaning of the Levels ofYo-gic Deeds and the Compendium of Determinations. (c) A presentation of other classifications of karma Other classifications of karma are presented in two parts: 1. The distinction between projecting and completing karma 2. Karma whose result you will definitely or only possibly experience (i) The distinction between projecting and completing karma Although the karma that projects a rebirth into a happy realm is virtuous and the karma that projects a rebirth into a miserable realm is nonvirtuous, there is no such certainty with regard to complet-ing karma. [186] Nonvirtuous actions create even in the happy realms such effects as not having complete limbs, fingers, or sen-sory organs; and having an unpleasant color, a short life span, many illnesses, and poverty. Further, virtuous actions create consummate wealth even for animals and hungry ghosts. This being the case, there are four sides to the relationship be-tween being projected and being completed. Among lives that are the result of virtuous projecting karma there are both results from virtuous completing karma and from nonvirtuous completing karma. Among lives that are the result of nonvirtuous projecting karma there are both results from nonvirtuous completing karma"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"240 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path and from virtuous completing karma. Asanga's Compendium of Knowledge (Abhidharma-samuccaya) says:416 Understand that virtuous and nonvirtuous actions project and bring to completion birth in the happy realms and the miserable realms. Projecting karma projects a fruition. Completing karma is that by which, in a rebirth, you experience the wanted and unwanted. The Treasury of Knowledge explains that a single action projects a single rebirth and does not project many rebirths. There are many completing actions, but many projecting actions do not project a single body. The Treasury of Knowledge:417 One projects one rebirth; Those that bring about completion are many. The Compendium of Knowledge:418 There is karma where a single action projects one body. There is karma where a single action projects many bodies. There is karma where many actions project a single body. There is karma where many actions project many bodies. The commentary explains Asanga's four types of karma, respec-tively, as a single instant of an action nourishing a seed of only a single lifetime's fruition; that action nourishing a seed of many life-times' fruitions; many instants of an action again and again nour-ishing a seed for just a single body; and many mutually dependent actions repeatedly nourishing seeds for the many bodies of a suc-cession of lifetimes. (ii) Karma whose result you will definitely or only possibly experience The Levels of Yogic Deeds:419 Karma whose result you will definitely experience is that consciously done and accumulated. Karma whose result you are not certain to experience is that consciously done but not accumulated. [187] The same text sets forth the distinction between having done karma and having accumulated karma:42o What is karma that you have done? An action that you have thought about or that you have consciously set into motion ei-ther physically or vocally. It continues:"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 241 Karma that you have accumulated is that not included among the following ten types of actions: actions done in dreams; those done unknowingly; those done unconsciously; those done without in-tensity or not continuously; those done in error; those done for-getfully; those done without wanting to; those naturally ethically neutral; those eradicated through regret; and those eradicated with a remedy. Karma that you have accumulated is the remaining actions, the ones not included in these ten types of action. Karma that you have not accumulated is just the ten types of actions indicated above. The Compendium ofDeterminations421 presents four permutations be-tween karma done and karma accumulated. Killing that is karma which you have done but not accumulated is seen in the following cases: that done unknowingly, that done in a dream, that not done intentionally, that which another person forced you to do against your will, that done only once and then regretted, that much less-ened upon assuming a vow to give up killing after overcoming the desire to kill by means of a deep understanding of its faults, that whose seed you weaken before its fruition can start by means of separating from worldly attachment, and that whose seed you have actually destroyed with a supramundane path of elimination. Killing that is karma that you have accumulated but have not done is seen in the following case: you investigate and analyze for a long time in order to kill a living being, but you do not kill it. Killing that is karma that you have done and accumulated is seen in all the killing not included in the previous two permutations. Killing that is karma that you have neither done nor accumulated is whatever is not included in the above three. Also understand in the same way, as appropriate, the non virtu-ous actions from stealing through senseless speech. The three men-tal nonvirtuous actions do not have the second permutation. [188] Within the first permutation, there are no mental actions that are not intentionally done nor are there any that you are forced by an-other to commit. From the viewpoint of the time at which you experience a re-sult, there are three types of certainty of experiencing results of karma: experiencing it here and now; experiencing it after taking rebirth; and experiencing it at another time. Karma that you experience here and now is the effect of actions which ripen in the very lifetime in which you do the actions. There are eight such types of karma mentioned in the Levels of Yogic Deeds:"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"242 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (1) nonvirtuous actions [that you have done] with a predomi-nant [attached] attitude of looking after your body, re-sources, and existence; (2) virtuous actions [that you have cultivated] with a pre-dominant attitude of not looking after these; (3) in the same way, [nonvirtuous actions that you have done with an attitude of] strong malice toward living beings; (4) [virtuous actions that you have cultivated with an atti-tude of] deep compassion and helpfulness; (5) [nonvirtuous actions that you have done with] great ani-mosity toward the three jewels, gurus, and the like; (6) [virtuous actions that you have cultivated with] an atti-tude of deep faith and belief in these; (7) nonvirtuous actions [that you have done] with an attitude of enmity toward those who have helped you such as par-ents and gurus, and an attitude of not repaying them for what they have done; (8) virtuous actions [that you have cultivated] with a strong attitude of wishing to repay those who have helped you. Karma that you will experience after you have been reborn is the ef-fect of actions which you will experience in the second [next] life-time. Karma that you will experience at other times is the effect of ac-tions which will ripen in or after the third lifetime. The way in which the many virtuous and nonvirtuous karmas that exist in your mind-stream ripen is as follows: (1) Whichever karma is weightiest will ripen first. (2) If weights are equal, whatever karma is manifest at the time of death will ripen first. (3) If this also is the same, whatever karma you have pre-dominantly become habituated to will ripen first. (4) If this also is the same, whatever karma you have done first will ripen earliest. As cited in the Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary:422 As to the actions that give rise to cyclic existence, There are those that are weighty, those that are near, Those to which you are habituated, and those you did earliest. Among these, the former will ripen first. 2' Reflecting on karma and its effects in detail"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 243 It is certainly the case that you will acquire a good body and mind through giving up the ten nonvirtuous actions. Nonetheless, if you were to bring about a body and mind that are fully qualified, this would accelerate your cultivation of the path as nothing else would. [189] Therefore, seek such a life. a\" The attributes of the fruitions There are eight fruitions: consummate life span, consummate color, consummate lineage, consummate power, trustworthy words, re-nown as a great power, being a male, and having strength. Consum-mate life span is when a virtuous projecting karma from a previous lifetime projects a long life span and you live for the long time that was projected. Consummate color is having an excellent body by way of its good color and shape; being pleasant to look at because you do not have incomplete sensory faculties;423 and being beautiful due to being well-proportioned. Consummate lineage is having been born with the good lineage that is esteemed and famed in the world. Con-summate power is great resources, an abundance of close associates such as relatives, and many helpers. Trustworthy words are words that living beings will accept because you are suitable to be trusted not to delude others physically or vocally, and are an authoritative wit-ness in all disputes. Renown as a great power is to be honored by a great multitude of beings because of your fame and wide acclaim due to your confident generosity and possession of good qualities such as perseverance. Being a male is to have a male organ. Having strength is, by the power of previous karma, naturally experiencing little injury, no illness, and great enthusiasm arising from this life's circumstartces. Moreover, the first, consummate life span, is living in a happy realm. The second, consummate color, is the body. The third, con-summate lineage, is birth. The fourth, consummate power, is re-sources and helpers. The fifth, trustworthy words, is being an au-thority in the world. The sixth, renown as a great power, is fame about such power. The seventh, being a male, is having the capac-ity for all good qualities. The eighth, strength, is having power in your activities. b\" The effects of the fruitions There are eight effects of the fruitions: 1) The effect of consummate life span is that you accumu-late much virtuous karma for a long time in terms of working for the welfare of both yourself and others. [190]"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"244 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 2) The effect of consummate color is that merely through see-ing you, disciples are pleased and gather around you. They then listen to your words and want to carry out your instructions. 3) The effect of consummate lineage is that people carry out your instructions without disregard. 4) The effect of consummate power is that through giving you gather living beings and then mature them. 5) The effect of trustworthy words is that through kind speech, purposeful behavior, and being one whose aims are the same as the disciples', you gather living beings and mature them. 6) The effect of renown as a great power is that, because you have helped and assisted others in all activities, they repay your kindness and listen immediately to your instructions. 7) The effect of being a male is that you will have the capac-ity for all good qualities, a capacity for all skilled actions by way of aspiration and endeavor, and a capacity for broad wisdom, the discrimination of objects of knowledge. Moreover, you will be unafraid in assemblies and will have no reversals or obstacles whether accompanying all living beings, speaking to them, en-joying resources with them, or dwelling in isolation. 8) The effect of strength is that, because you are not disillu-sioned about either your own or others' welfare and are steady in your great enthusiasm for them, you will obtain the power of discernment, and then quickly have the superknowledges.424 c\" The causes of the fruitions There are eight causes of the fruitions: 1) The cause of consummate life span is not harming living beings and the application of a nonviolent attitude. Further, it is said that: By rescuing those approaching a place where they will be killed, And likewise giving life to others, And turning harm away from living beings, You will acquire a long life span. Through caring for the sick, Through a doctor's giving medicine to the sick, And through not harming living beings with sticks, Clumps of earth, and the like, you will be without illness. 2) The cause of consummate color is giving light, such as butter lamps, and new clothing. Further, it is said that:"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The Varieties of Karma 245 By relying on kindness And giving jewelry, you will have a good physical form. The result of being without jealousy Is said to be good fortune. 3) The cause of consummate lineage is first overcoming pride and then making obeisance and so forth to gurus and the like, and respecting others as if you were their servant. [191J 4) The cause of consummate power is giving food, cloth-ing, and so forth to those who request them; even when they are not requested, giving such assistance; and giving to those who suffer and to recipients who have good qualities but no possessions. 5) The cause of trustworthy words is habituation to giving up the four vocal nonvirtues. 6) The cause of renown as a great power is making asp ira-tional prayers to acquire various good qualities in the future, making offerings to the three jewels, and making offerings to parents, sriivakas, pratyekabuddhas, abbots, masters, and gurus. 7) The cause of being a male is delight in the attributes of a male, lack of delight in female things and seeing their disad-vantages, stopping the yearnings of those who want to be re-born in women's bodies, and rescuing those whose male or-gans will be cut off. 8) The cause of strength is accomplishing what cannot at all be done by others, assisting in what can be done with your collaboration, and giving food and drink. If these eight causes are endowed with three causes-[pure attitude, pure application, and pure recipient]-their fruitions will be out-standing. Among the three causes, there are two types of pure atti-tude-self-directed and other-directed. The two self-directed pure attitudes are: (1) not hoping for fruition, which is dedicating the virtues from your creation of the causes for unexcelled enlightenment; (2) intense power, which is achieving the causes from the depths of your heart. The two other-directed pure attitudes are: (1) abandoning jealousy, competitiveness, and contempt when you see fellow practitioners of the teaching who are better, equal, or less than yourself, and admiring them;"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"246 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (2) even if you are unable to do the above, discerning many times every day that you must do it. There are two types of pure application-self-directed and other-directed. The self-directed pure application is applying yourself to cultivating virtue for a long time, without interruption, and with great intensity. The other-directed pure application is causing those who have not adopted vows and other commitments to do so, prais-ing those who have made such commitments so that they may delight in them, making them continue, and making them not aban-don them. Pure field is so called because those two-attitude and application-are similar to a field in that they give effects that are numerous and good.

Further, the King of Concentrations Satra says:426 Were the moon and the stars to fall from their place And the earth with its mountains and cities to perish Or the realm of the sky to completely transform, You [Buddha] still would not speak a word of untruth. Thus, have conviction in the teachings of the Tathagata, and then sustain your meditation on them. If you do not have uncontrived certainty about this quality of truth in the Buddha's teachings, then you will not gain the certainty that will please the Conqueror with regard to any of the teachings. Some, who claim that they have acquired certain knowledge of emptiness, are uncertain about karma and its effects and do not value it. This is a mistaken understanding of emptiness. For, once you understand emptiness, you will see that it is the meaning of dependent-arising, and it will assist you in becoming certain about karma and its effects. The same sutra says:427 Like illusions, bubbles, mirages, and lightning, All phenomena are like the moon [reflected] in water. It is not the case that living beings-who die And go on to their next lives-are offspring of Manu [the first human at the beginning of the eon]. Yet the karma that you possess does not disappear; The virtuous and nonvirtuous give rise to their effects accord-ingly; This logical approach is sound; though subtle and difficult to see, [193J It is within the scope of the Conqueror. Therefore, develop certain knowledge of dependent-arising to-gether with the causality of the two kinds of karma, and examine your physical, verbal, and mental actions all day and all night. By this means, you will put an end to miserable rebirths. However, if at the outset you are not versed in the classifications of cause and effect, understanding only a fragment of their depth and having a lax attitude with your physical, verbal, and mental actions, then you are merely throwing open the door to the miserable realms.

How am I spending the day and the night?\" When the former gurus in this lineage had examined their minds in that way, they said: On this occasion of training in karma and its effects, when we com-pare our actions of body, speech, and mind to what is taught in the teaching, they will not be in conformity. In this we are deficient. Therefore, we are not at all liberated. We must see whether we are in conformity or not by comparing ourselves to the laws of karma and its effects. When we examine our mind in light of the teach-ings, we are wise if we sincerely recognize nonconformity or a com-plete lack of conformity. The Collection of Indicative Verses:429 Those who are childish and know themselves To be childish are wise in this regard. When we are comparing ourselves with the teachings, it can be like carrying a corpse430-we are at odds with the teachings. When you hope to be the best of religious persons and revered scholars, you are being the worst of the childish. The Collection of Indicative Verses:431 Those who are childish but consider themselves To be wise-they are called childish. At the very least, understand what is being said with regard to the teachings and examine yourself accordingly. Also, Bo-do-wa, who quotes this teaching as seen in the Garland of Birth Stories, asserts that you must examine your mind. As it says in the Garland of Birth Stories:432 From the sky to the earth is a long way. From the distant shore of the ocean to the closest edge is also a long way. From the mountains of the east to the mountains of the west is an even longer way. But from the ordinary [person] to the sublime teaching is longer yet than that. [194] This verse says that a great gulf exists between us, ordinary people, and the teaching. This verse is a teaching that the gift-bearing brahmin Subha~ita explained to the bodhisattva prince Candra af-ter the prince had offered one thousand gold coins to him.

Furthermore, how you turn away from wrongdoing once you have reflected in this way is stated in the Chapter of the Truth Speaker:433 o King, do not kill. Life is very dear to all beings. Hence, they want to maintain their lives for a long time. So think not of killing, even in the depths of your mind. Apply this attitude of restraint toward the ten nonvirtuous actions as well as the misdeeds previously explained. Do so without even giving rise to the motivating thoughts. Become accustomed to this attitude, and use it frequently. If you do not reject wrongdoing in this way, you will experience suffering. No matter where you go, you will not be free from it. Therefore, it is not sensible to engage in actions that seem to bring happiness in the short term, yet have effects you must endure with tears covering your face. On the other hand, it is sensible to engage in actions that give you faultless happiness and delight when you experience the ripening of their effects. The Collection of Indicative Verses:434 If you fear suffering And do not enjoy it, Do not commit sinful actions Either in public or in private.

What are the four? They are the power of eradication; the power of applying remedies; the power of turn-ing away from faults; and the power of the foundation. You will definitely experience the result of karma that you have done and accumulated. Since the four powers can destroy this kind of karma before it starts to take effect, it goes without saying that the four powers can destroy karma whose result is indefinite. The four powers are as follows. 1\" The power of eradication The first power is great contrition for having done nonvirtuous actions since beginningless time. In order to feel this, it is neces-sary to meditate on the way in which you produce the three effects of actions-fruitional and so forth. At the time of putting this into practice, do so by way of the two methods-the confession of sins in the Satra of the Golden Light (SuvanJa-prabhasa-sutra)436 and the confession of sins by way of the thirty-five buddhas.437 2\" The power of applying remedies The second power has six sections: 1) \"Dependence on the profound sutras\" includes such ac-tivities as receiving the oral transmission of sutras such as the Prajfiaparamita, retaining their meaning, and reading them. 2) \"Interest in emptiness\" means to comprehend the reality in which there is no self and which is luminously clear, and to have conviction that the mind is primordially pure. 3) \"Dependence on recitation\" means to recite, according to the rituals, the special formulae such as the hundred-syl-lable [mantra of Vajrasattva]. The Tantra Requested by Subahu states:438 The flames from fires that spread in spring forests Are out of control, burning up all the thickets;"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Cultivating Ethical Behavior 253 Likewise, the winds of ethical discipline fan the fires of recita-tion And the flames of great perseverance burn up sins. Just as when the sun's rays destabilize snow It melts in the unbearable brilliance, So too do the snows of sins disappear When destabilized by the sunbeams of recitation and ethical discipline. [197] Lighting a butter lamp in a dark gloom Entirely clears away the darkness; Likewise, the darkness of sins accumulated for a thousand lifetimes Is quickly dispelled by the butter lamp of recitation. Further, repeat the recitations until you see signs that you have cleared away your sins. The Formula of Exhortation (sKul byed kyi gzungs) states that the signs are dreaming the follow-ing: vomiting bad food; consuming such foods as yogurt and milk; vomiting; seeing the sun and the moon; moving through the air; blazing fires; subduing water buffalo and persons in dark clothing; seeing the community of monks or nuns; see-ing a tree that gives out a milky substance; riding upon an elephant or a bull; climbing upon a lion throne; climbing up a mansion or a mountain; and listening to the teaching. 4) \"Dependence upon images\" means to make images of the Buddha once you have acquired faith in him. 5) \"Dependence on worship\" means to make a variety of offerings to an image of the Buddha or to a stupa. 6) \"Dependence on names\" means to hear the recitation of and retain the names of buddhas and great conquerors' children. These six types of remedies are only those that occur in Santideva's Compendium of Trainings. There are many others. 3\" The power of turning away from faults The third power is actually restraining yourself from the ten non-virtuous actions. In the Sun Essence Sutra, the Buddha said that this restraint destroys all karma, afflictions, and obscurations of the teaching created physically, verbally, or mentally by way of killing and the like. The third power eliminates bad actions that you have previously created yourself, caused others to create, or have rejoiced in others creating. Confession that lacks an attitude of wholehearted restraint becomes merely words. Dharmamitra's Commentary on the"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"254 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path \"Sidra on the Discipline\" explains that the Buddha was thinking of this fact when he said in scripture, \"Is there subsequent restraint?\" Therefore, it is very important to have an attitude of restraint within which you have conviction not to commit that action again. More-over the development of this attitude depends on the first power. 4\" The power of the foundation The fourth power is going for refuge to the three jewels and culti-vating the spirit of enlightenment. [198] With regard to this, the Conqueror spoke in general about a variety of means through which beginners could remove their sins. However, a complete remedy requires all four powers to be present. The sins are removed in several ways. One way is when small sufferings occur instead of the great sufferings of rebirth in the miserable realms. Another is that, even if you are born in a miser-able realm, you do not experience its sufferings. Still another is that a mere headache in the present life serves to remove the sin. Like-wise, the sins whose effects you must experience for a long time may become ones whose effects you experience for only a short time or that you need not experience at all. There is no certainty about how sins are removed, because it depends on whether the purifier is of great or little strength, whether the remedy is one in which the four powers are complete or incomplete, intense or not intense, of long or short duration, and so forth. The statement in both sutra and texts on discipline that \"karma does not perish even in one hundred eons\" is made with regard to the karma for which you have not cultivated a remedy with the four powers. However, if you purify yourself with a remedy having the aforementioned four powers, it is said that you will even remove karma that you are bound to experience. Haribhadra's Long Expla-nation of the Perfection of Wisdom Satra in Eight Thousand Lines (AbhisamayalarJlkaraloka) states:439 Thus, with powerful remedies you can completely eliminate the unfavorable factors, which diminish when you possess the group of remedies. This, for example, is like the tarnish on gold. Because all such things as obstructions to the sublime teaching will neces-sarily diminish as just explained, you will completely eliminate infractions which originate from arrogance. You should understand that the statement, 1/ Any karma at all, even for a hundred eons ... ,\" is qualified by, \"If you have not cultivated the group of remedies.\" Were this not the case, there"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Cultivating Ethical Behavior 255 would be a contradiction with reason and a contradiction with many sutras. You can also understand the Buddha's expression, \"karma whose effects you will definitely experience,\" with the qualification that you have not cultivated the group of remedies. Understand that the Buddha's expression, \"karma whose effects you will not defi-nitely experience,\" refers to effects that occur only sometimes, even though you may not have cultivated the group of remedies. [199J In this way, confession, restraint, and so forth weaken the capacity of karma to bear fruit. Such karma will not bear fruit even when it comes in contact with other conditions. Likewise, it is said that anger and the production of wrong views weaken the ability of roots of virtue to give effects. Bhavaviveka's Blaze of Reasons (Tarka-jvala) says:440 Wrong views and malice weaken virtuous karma. Remedies such as repudiation, restraint, and confession weaken bad karma. Whenever any of these attitudes are present, they reduce the po-tency of the seeds deposited by the virtuous and nonvirtuous karma, even though the combination of conditions for the karma to take effect are already in place. So where would an effect come from, and what would it be like? Because there is no combination of conditions for maintaining the potency of the seeds deposited by karma, the time for being maintained has changed. Because of this, there is a thorough eradication of the karma. As it has been said, \"Moreover, by upholding the sublime teaching you will ex-perience in this life the effects of a sin whose consequence you are certain to experience.\" And, \"Furthermore, with this remedy, karma for rebirth in the miserable realms transforms into a mere headache.\" Qualm: If karma that would otherwise result in rebirth in a miserable realm can be weakened and have the effect of becom-ing merely a headache, how can this be considered a complete removal? Reply: The culminating effect of your sinful karma will be the experience of suffering in the hells. With this remedy, though, you do not experience even tiny sufferings in the hells. How can this not be considered a very complete removal? Yet, how could these results of headaches and the like be examples of karma not hav-ing any effects? You have not found a remedy that destroys the seeds of the afflic-tions. Yet, you have weakened the karma with a contrary condi-tion. Consequently, even though other conditions do assemble, the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"256 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path karma does not fructify. You can see many such situations among external and internal causes and effects. Therefore, although you strive at the accumulation of much vir-tuous karma, if you do not guard against the causes that destroy virtuous karma such as anger, the virtuous karma will not give its effect, as stated above. Hence, you must strive to guard against causes that destroy virtuous karma and make an effort to remedy nonvirtuous karma. [200] Qualm: If you can totally remove even very powerful karma, how is it that the sutras say, \"Except for the fruitions of former karma\"? Reply: There is no fault with this reasoning. The Buddha spoke in this way with the following intention: when fruitions such as blindness already exist, it is difficult to remove them with a rem-edy. However, it is easy to stop the effects from arising at the time of the cause, i.e., when the effect has not already taken place. The Blaze of Reasons says:441 Qualm: If it is the case that a sin will be completely eliminated, why did the Buddha teach, \"Except for the fruitions of former karma\"? Reply: The Buddha taught this while having in mind the case of the karma of blindness, having one eye, being lame, crippled, dumb, deaf, and the like, where there is no ability to eliminate the effects of karma that has already come to fruition. The intention that is in the form of a cause comes to an end when you acquire a different motivation. This is demonstrated by the cases of people [who committed murder but later repented] such as Angulimala, Ajatasatru, Asoka, Svaka, and those who killed their fathers. 442 Qualm: [Upon their deaths] Ajatasatru and the killers of their mothers had developed other virtuous attitudes. Why then were they reborn in the Unrelenting Hell? Did they fail to eliminate their karma? Reply: It was taught that they were reborn in such places as the Unrelenting Hell in order to develop conviction in their karma and its effects. It is not the case that they failed to completely elimi-nate their remaining karma. Like a silk ball that falls and bounces up, they were born in a hell and were then freed. They were also untouched by the fiery garlands of hell and so forth. This being so, it is proven both that you can completely eradicate sins and that karma certainly has effects. It is not definite that some particular persons can eliminate their karma. The Buddha spoke of this in the King of Concentrations SlUra. King Suradatta killed Supu~pacandra and felt contrite about it.443"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Cultivating Ethical Behavior 257 [201] He built a stilpa and made very extensive offerings. Three times each day he would confess his sins. He did this for nine hundred and fifty billion years. Even though he maintained his ethical dis-cipline correctly in that way, upon his death he was reborn in Un-relenting Hell. For ten or twenty billion eons he experienced limit-less sufferings-having his eyes squeezed out and so forth. Nonetheless, confession is not senseless. For if you do not con-fess sins, you will experience sufferings that are greater and of longer duration than if you had confessed them. Through confession and restraint you can purify yourself of sins without any remainder. However, there is a vast difference between the purity of having never been tarnished by a fault from the be-ginning and the purity attained through confession of that fault. For example, the Bodhisattva Levels says:444 You can redress the occurrence of a root infraction through adopt-ing the bodhisattva vow. However, it will be impossible to attain the first bodhisattva level in this lifetime. Further, the Sidra Gathering All the Threads445 states that even though you clear away sins, you will need at least ten eons to attain the level of forbearance [second of the four levels of the path of prepa-ration]: The youthful Manjusri asked, \"0 Bhagavan, if someone, under the influence of a sinful companion, were to do such a thing as abandon the teaching, how, Bhagavan, would this person be freed from that in this lifetime?\" The Bhagavan replied, \"Manjusri, if you were to confess your fault three times a day for seven years, you would clear it away. Subsequent to this you would attain the level of forbearance in ten eons, at the least.\" Therefore, complete purification means to completely purify your-self of the arising of unpleasant effects. However, since you greatly extend the time needed to attain such things as knowledge of the path, strive not to be tarnished by faults from the start. [202] The Buddha said that for this reason noble beings do not consciously engage in even the subtlest of sins or infractions, even for the sake of their own lives. If it was the case that purity through confession was similar to faults that have never taken place, then there would be no need to act in this way. This is also evident in the world. Although an injured hand, foot, and so on may heal, they are different from the ones that have never had an injury."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"258 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Through striving in that way, you should do as the Collection of Indicative Verses says;446 A person of sinful conduct-Who has committed sins and not gained merit, Who has parted from the teaching and attained its opposite-Will fear death, like a weak boat breaking apart in a great river. A person who has gained merit and has not committed sins, And who has practiced the teaching of the holy ones' system, Will never fear death, Like a sturdy boat going across a river. Do not act like the person of the first verse but do whatever you can to act like the person of the second verse. Further, there is little sense in saying many reasonable words but acting in an unruly way. Even if you only know a little, there is great benefit in practicing whatever teaching you know by casting aside what is wrong and adopting what is right. The Collection of Indica-tive Verses says;447 The unruly may speak at length on what is reasonable, Yet they do not act accordingly. Like herdsmen counting others' livestock, They do not attain the fortune of virtuous practice. Those who practice the teaching in accordance with their instructions And eradicate attachment, hostility, and ignorance Attain the fortune of virtuous practice, Though they may speak little of what is reasonable. Through delighting in conscientiousness And fearing unruliness, Monks pull themselves from the miserable realms, Like elephants pull themselves from the mud. Through delighting in conscientiousness And fearing unruliness, Monks shake off all sins Like the wind shakes leaves from the trees. This being so, the proper view of dependent-arising and the cau-sality of the two types of karma is the indispensable foundation for the practices of all the vehicles and the aims of all beings.

You have generated the attitude of a per-son of small capacity when these interests change places, and your interest in the future has become paramount, while your interest in this life has become merely incidental. However, you must make this attitude stable. Thus, once it has occurred, cultivate it diligently. c) Clearing up misconceptions concerning the attitude of a person of small capacity Misconception: In the scriptures it says that you must turn your mind away from all the excellent things of cyclic existence. Someone could misinterpret this and think that is improper to develop an interest in high status [as a human or deity] in which body, resources, and the like are excellent, because it is within cyclic existence. Response: There are two kinds of objects of interest: those which you diligently seek temporarily and those which you diligently seek ultimately. Even persons who strive for liberation must diligently"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"262 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path but temporarily seek excellent bodies, etc., in cyclic existence. For, they will ultimately attain certain goodness through a succession of lives in high status. [204] Further, not everything within high status-excellent body, re-sources, and attendants-is included within cyclic existence. The most excellent body is a buddha's embodiment as form; the most excellent resources are the riches of this embodiment's realm; and the most excellent attendants are this embodiment's retinue. Intend-ing this, Maitreya says in the Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras450 that you achieve high status as a human or deity by means of the first four perfections: Excellent resources and body And excellent retinue-high status. Again, it is said in many texts that you achieve a buddha's embodi-ment as form by means of the first four perfections. Therefore, those who achieve omniscience accomplish a great amount of exceptional ethical discipline, generosity, patience, and the like for a long time. Consequently, they diligently seek the ef-fects of these as well-exceptional high status with its body and so forth. The achievement of the final goal, certain goodness, is spoken of in Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:451 Relying on the boat of the human body, Free yourself from the great river of suffering. As Santideva says, you must rely on a life in a happy realm-ex-emplified in the verse by the human body-and cross the ocean of existence, reaching omniscience. Moreover, you must pass succes-sively through many lifetimes. Consequently, ethical discipline-the preeminent cause of achieving a body in a happy realm-is the root of the path. Moreover, you need a body in a happy realm that is fully quali-fied, for even if you have achieved the path, you will make little progress with a body that is not completely qualified and only possesses good qualities to some extent. For this, it is not enough to partially observe the fundamental trainings of novice monks and the like. You must strive to maintain the fundamental trainings of monks and so on in their entirety. Misconception: Some say that if maintaining ethical discipline is for the purpose of achieving a rebirth in a happy realm, you can achieve this even by a one-day vow.

However, do not be satisfied with this alone: after you have devel-oped the attitude that is shared with persons of small capacity, develop the attitude that is shared with persons of medium capac-ity-namely, disgust with all of cyclic existence. On this basis, you may aspire to become a person of great capacity by developing the spirit of supreme enlightenment. Consequently, you must train in the attitude of a person of me-dium capacity. Why? Because even were you to reach the level of a deity or a human, you would be mistaken if you believed this to be pleasurable by nature, since you would still not have escaped the suffering of conditionality.452 Therefore, in reality, you would have no happiness whatsoever-your life would still come to a bad end, for you would surely fall into a miserable realm again. A human or divine lifetime is like resting on a precipice just before falling into the abyss. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:453 After repeatedly coming to happy rebirths, And experiencing much joy there, You die and fall into the protracted And unbearable suffering of the miserable realms. Candragomin's Letter to a Student:454 [207] You who whirl constantly in cyclic existence, Yet who enter a happy realm mistaking mere calm for happiness, Will certainly wander helplessly Through hundreds of like and unlike realms. Consequently, you have to become as thoroughly disenchanted with the happy realms as you were with the miserable realms. As Aryadeva's Four Hundred Stanzas says:455 High states frighten the wise As much as hell. Rare is the state of existence That does not terrify them. Also, the Verse Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines says:456 Those whose minds are attached to cyclic existence will continue to wander there constantly."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"The Eight Types of Suffering 267 The Letter to a Student:457 The more you conceive all beings as happy, The more dense the darkness of your delusion becomes. The more you conceive all beings as suffering, The more the darkness of your delusion lessens. The more you contemplate what is pleasant, The more the flames of attachment spread. The more you contemplate what is unpleasant, The more the flames of attachment abate. From beginningless time you have been conditioned to believe that the wonders of cyclic existence are sources of happiness, and you have habitually projected upon them a false image of beauty. But if, as a remedy, you train yourself to meditate on suffering and unpleas-antness, you will put an end to these wrong ideas. Candragomin says that if you neglect to meditate on these, ignorance and attachment will increase, and you will continue to fuel the process of cyclic ex-istence. Hence, it is vitally important to meditate on the faults of cy-clic existence. The faults of cyclic existence are explained in three parts: 1. The mental training (Chapters 17-21) 2. The measure of the determination to be free (Chapter 22) 3. Dispelling misconceptions (Chapter 22) a) The mental training This is explained in two parts: 1. Identifying the mind intent on liberation 2. The method for developing the mind intent on liberation i) Identifying the mind intent on liberation [208] Liberation means freedom from bondage, and what binds you to cy-clic existence is karma and the afflictions. Under their power, the ag-gregates are reborn in a threefold manner: in terms of the three realms they are reborn in the desire realm, and so forth; in terms of kinds of beings, they are reborn as the five [deities, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hell-beings] or six kinds of beings [the five plus demi-gods]; and in terms of the type of birth, they are reborn in four ways-by birth from a womb, birth from eggs, birth from heat and moisture, and spontaneous birth. Since this is the nature of bondage, freedom from rebirth impelled by karma and the afflictions is liberation, and the desire to obtain that freedom is the mind intent on liberation."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"268 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Moment by moment the compositional activity of karma and the afflictions arises and is destroyed, but this destruction is not lib-eration. Though things that have been produced do not abide for a second moment, this destruction is not contingent upon conditions for liberation, such as the cultivation of a remedy [knowledge of selflessness]. If this were liberation, it would follow that everyone would be liberated without effort, and that is absurd. Consequently, if you fail to cultivate the remedy, you will be reborn in the future, since you only stop rebirth by cultivating the remedy. ii) The method for developing the mind intent on liberation The desire to relieve the suffering of thirst is based on seeing that you do not want to be tormented by thirst. Likewise, the desire to attain liberation-which relieves the suffering of the aggregates appropriated by karma and the afflictions-is based upon seeing that the appropriated aggregates are flawed insofar as they have suffering as their nature. Unless you develop a determination to reject cyclic existence through meditating on its faults, you will not seek relief from the suffering of the appropriated aggregates. The Four Hundred Stanzas:458 How can one who is not disenchanted With this world appreciate peace? Cyclic existence, like home, Is difficult to leave behind.

Showing the significance of the Buddha's asserting the truth of suffering as the first of the four truths 2. The actual meditation on suffering a\" Showing the significance of the Buddha's asserting the truth of suffering as the first of the four truths Qualm: [209] The true origins are the causes and true sufferings are their effects. Why, then, did the Bhagavan reverse that order, if the origins precede sufferings, and say: \"Monks, this is the noble truth of suffering; this is the noble truth of the origin\"? Reply: In this case, the Teacher reversed the sequence of cause and effect, not out of error, but because this reversal is vital for prac-tice. Why? If his disciples failed to develop a proper determination to liberate themselves from cyclic existence first, they would sever the very root of liberation. How then could he lead them to libera-tion? Thus, in the beginning, the darkness of ignorance enshrouded his students; they mistook the wonders of cyclic existence-which are in fact suffering-for happiness. As the Four Hundred Stanzas says:459 Fool! If there is no end whatsoever To this ocean of suffering, Why are you, Who are caught up in it, not afraid? By saying \"In fact this [cyclic existence] is not happiness but suf-fering,\" the Buddha explained many forms of suffering, and led his disciples to become disenchanted with cyclic existence and recog-nize it as suffering. As this is a necessary precondition, the Buddha spoke first about the truth of suffering. Once you recognize suffering, you see yourself as submerged in an ocean of suffering, and realize that, if you want to be liberated from suffering, you must counteract it. Moreover, you recognize that you cannot stop suffering unless you counteract its cause. By investigating the cause of suffering, you come to understand its true origin. Consequently, the Buddha spoke next about the truth of the origin. [210] Next you develop an understanding of the truth of the origin, an understanding that contaminated karma produces the suffer-ing of cyclic existence, that afflictions produce karma and that the conception of self is the root of the afflictions. When you see that you can eliminate the conception of self, you will vow to realize"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"270 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path its cessation, which is also the cessation of suffering. Thus, the Buddha spoke next about the truth of cessation. Qualm: If teaching the truth of suffering promotes the desire for liberation, should not the Buddha have taught the truth of cessa-tion immediately after teaching the truth of suffering? Reply: There is no mistake. Why? At this point, after you recog-nize the truth of suffering, you have a desire for liberation, and think, \"If only I could attain a cessation that relieves this suffering!\" But if you have not identified the cause of suffering, and have not seen that you can eliminate that cause, you do not yet regard lib-eration as something attainable and thus do not think, \"I will real-ize a cessation.\" In this way, when you do think, \"I shall realize a cessation that is liberation,\" you become interested in the truth of the path, won-dering about the path that leads to this cessation. For this reason, the Buddha spoke about the truth of the path last. In the same way, the Sublime Continuum says:460 Recognize that you are ill; eliminate the cause of the illness; Attain health; rely on a remedy. Likewise, you should recognize, eliminate, attain, and rely upon Suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path, respectively. This being the case, the four truths are taught repeatedly through-out the Mahayana and the Hinayana. Since the Sugata has included in the four truths the vital points concerning the process of cyclic existence and its cessation, this teaching is crucial for achieving free-dom. Since this synoptic outline of practice is important, it must be taught to students in just this order. Why? Unless you reflect on the truth of suffering to the point of actually becoming revolted by cyclic existence, your desire to attain liberation will be mere words, and whatever you do will lead to origins of further suffering. Un-less you reflect on the origin of suffering until you have a good un-derstanding of the root of cyclic existence, which is karma and the afflictions, you will be like an archer who does not see the target-you will miss the essential points of the path. You will mistake what is not a path to freedom from cyclic existence for the path and ex-haust yourself without result. Finally, if you fail to understand the need to eliminate suffering and its origin, you will also fail to rec-ognize the liberation that provides relief from suffering and its ori-gin; [211] hence your interest in liberation will be a mere conceit."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The Eight Types of Suffering 271 b\" The actual meditation on suffering The actual meditation on suffering is explained in two parts: 1.

For, as Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says, there will be little result from any virtuous practice if the mind is distracted:465 The One Who Knows Reality466 has said that Prayers, austerities, and such-Even if practiced for a long time-Are pointless if done with a distracted mind. [212] Also, the Satra of Cultivating Faith in the Mahayana (Mahayana-prasada-prabhavana-satra) says:467 o child of a good family, from this enumeration you should know that faith in the Mahayana of the bodhisattvas, and all that emerges out of the Mahayana, comes from properly contemplating the meaning and the teaching with a mind that is not distracted. Here, a \"mind that is not distracted\" means a mind that does not wander to objects that are other than the virtuous object of medita-tion; \"the meaning and the teaching\" refers to the meaning and the words; and \"properly contemplating\" means analyzing and reflect-ing with discernment. This shows that any achievement of a virtu-ous quality requires both undistracted focus and analytical discern-ment. Therefore, the Buddha says that any achievement of a virtuous quality in the three vehicles requires a state of mind that is both (1) an actual meditative serenity, or a similitude of it, which rests one-pointedly on its virtuous object of meditation without wandering from it; and (2) an actual insight, or a similitude of it, which carefully analyzes a virtuous object of meditation and dis-tinguishes both the real nature and the diversity of phenomena. Similarly, the Satra Unravelling the Intended Meaning (Sa1Jldhi-nirmocana-satra) says:468 Maitreya, you should know that all the virtuous qualities, mun-dane or supramundane, of the sriivakas, the bodhisattvas or the tathagatas result from meditative serenity and insight. Construe \"meditative serenity\" and \"insight\" here as including both actual serenity and insight and states of mind that are similar to them. For it is not certain that all of the good qualities of the three vehicles develop as a result of actual serenity and insight. (i) The suffering of birth There are five points to contemplate: 1) Birth is suffering because it is associated with pain: [213] birth is accompanied by many intense feelings of pain for the fol-lowing four types of living beings: those born as hell-beings,"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The Eight Types of Suffering 273 hungry ghosts who invariably suffer, beings born from a womb, and beings born from an egg. 2) Birth is suffering because it is associated with dysfunctional tendencies:469 all of the compositional factors of the three realms, because they are associated with dysfunctional tendencies that are in harmony with the class of the afflictions, are ill-suited [to the service of virtue] and uncontrollable. Moreover, once you possess the compositional factors of a living being within the three realms, you too are bound to dysfunctional tenden-cies that are in harmony with the class of afflictions. In short, because the compositional factors are associated with seeds that generate, sustain, and increase the afflictions, they are ill-suited to the service of virtue; furthermore, you cannot con-trol them as you would wish. 3) Birth is suffering because it is the origin of suffering: you take birth in the three realms and on that basis suffer old age, ill-ness, and death. 4) Birth is suffering because it is the origin of the afflictions: when you are born in cyclic existence, the three mental poisons arise for objects of attachment, hostility, and ignorance, and as a re-sult, body and mind are disturbed and in pain, and you can-not be happy. The afflictions torment your body and mind in numerous ways. 5) Birth is suffering because it is an unwanted separation: all births end in death, which is undesirable, and causes you to experience only suffering. Thus, at birth you are bound to pain and endowed with dysfunc-tional tendencies. Birth leads to illness, aging, and so forth, as well as to the afflictions and death. Consider how these give rise to suf-fering as well. In particular, the suffering you undergo in the womb is as de-scribed in Candragomin's Letter to a Student:47o [214] After you have entered the womb, which is like hell, You are hemmed in by foul-smelling filth And trapped in pitch-dark gloom. Your body cramped, you must undergo enormous sufferings. The Descent into the Womb Sidra explains the meaning of these words:471 Filthy with quantities of urine, brain-like substances, thick saliva, and marrow, the fetus dwells above the intestines and below the stomach, in a space which is filled with many kinds of filth and is"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"274 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path home to a myriad of bacteria, with two very foul-smelling open-ings and hollows and apertures in the bone. Its front faces the ver-tebrae and its back, the stomach wall. It is nourished every month by its mother's uterine blood. The bits of food its mother has eaten are ground by her two rows of teeth and swallowed. As it is swal-lowed, the food is moistened from below by saliva and the ooz-ing of mouth sores, while it is polluted from above by thick sa-liva. The remains of that vomit-like food enter from above through the umbilical cord's opening and generate growth. Through the thickening, quivering, elongated, and globular stages, the embryo is completely transformed into a fetus with arms and legs. The placenta encloses its arms, legs, and cheeks. Reeking like an old rag used for mucus, the stench is unbearable. Enshrouded in pitch darkness, it moves up and down. The bitter, sour, pungent, salty, spicy, and astringent tastes of food affect it like hot coals. Like an intestinal worm, it feeds on filthy fluids; it finds itself in a swamp that oozes rotting filth. Its life-force is unstable. The heat of its mother's body torments, heats, and overheats it all in three de-grees: slightly, moderately, and greatly. It experiences distressing, intense, violent, and unbearable agony. Whenever its mother moves a little, moderately, or greatly, it also moves in the same way, constrained by five bonds.472 [215] It experiences agony that is distressing, intense, violent, unbearable, and almost inconceiv-able, as though it had been thrust into a pit of burning cinders. Similarly, it is said that the fetus is harmed in the womb when the mother eats too much or too little; eats food that is too oily, pungent, cold, hot, salty, sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, or astringent; indulges her sexual desires; runs too much or too fast; jumps or swims; or sits or squats in front of the fire. It is also said that the fetus is confined by the stomach and held firm by the intestines, as though it were bound by five bonds or impaled on a stake. There is even further suffering when the infant emerges from the womb and is born into the outside. Candragomin's Letter to a Stu-dent says:473 It is crushed slowly, like sesame seeds in an oil press, And then somehow it is born. Nonetheless, those who do not lose their lives immediately Must settle for pain. The body that dwelt and grew in that filth Is smeared with the womb's slime and has an unbearably foul smell. Memory is lost upon being inflicted with such torment,"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Eight Types of Suffering 275 Which is like having an inflamed boil burst or being on the verge of vomiting. The Descent into the Womb SCdra explains the meaning of these words:474 Thus, when all its major and minor limbs have developed, the fetus stirs in a frightful, pitch-dark place of urine that oozes rot, has an unbearable stench, is contaminated by excrement and urine, and continually dripping with foul-smelling filth, blood, and putrid fluids. Energy arising from the maturation of previ-ous karma makes its feet turn up and its head turn down toward the opening. With both arms drawn in, it is slightly, moderately, and utterly smashed between two machines of bone. [216] The distressing, intense, violent, and unbearable agonies cause all the limbs of the body-painful as fresh wounds-to turn blue. All of the body's organs become hot. Since the uterine slime is now much reduced, the surface of the body dries out, and so the lips, throat, and heart become parched. Confined and full of insufferable dread, it emerges-however difficult this may be-when drawn out by the influence of causes and conditions, by energies arising from the maturation of previous karma. Once outside, the air burns like caustic liquid on a wound; the mere touch of a hand or a cloth feels like the cut of a sword. It experiences distressing, intense, violent, and unbearable agony. It is said that when taken up onto someone's lap and the like, or touched with hot or cold objects, the newborn baby experiences dis-tressing, intense, violent, and unbearable agony, like a flayed cow being eaten by vermin or a leper whose lesions are struck with a whip. Among the eight types of sufferings, regard this first type, along with the eighth type [the suffering of the five appropriated aggre-gates], as the most crucial and meditate upon both of them. There-fore, as explained before, you should repeatedly investigate them with discerning wisdom and meditate on them. (ii) The suffering of old age There are five points to contemplate: 1) A handsome body deteriorates: your back bends down like a bow; your head is white like the dra-wa (spra-ba) grass flower; wrinkles cover your forehead like the lines of a cutting board. In ways such as these, youth breaks down and you become unattractive."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"276 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 2) Physical strength and vigor deteriorate: for example, when you sit down, you drop like a sack of dirt cut from a rope; when you rise up, it is like uprooting a tree; when you speak, you are incoherent; and when you walk, you stumble. [217] 3) The senses deteriorate: your eyes cannot see forms clearly, and so forth; and the power of memory and the other facul-ties wanes due to extreme forgetfulness, and so on. 4) Enjoyment of sense objects fades: you have difficulty digest-ing food and drink, and cannot enjoy desirable objects. 5) The deterioration aflife is painful: as your life nears exhaus-tion, you head rapidly toward death. Think about these points again and again. As the Extensive Sport Sidra says:475 As aging progresses and we pass a certain point, We are like a tree struck by lightning, Withered by old age like a terrible, decrepit house. o Sage, speak quickly about an escape from old age. Age enfeebles the masses of men and women As a windstorm strips vines from a grove of sal trees. Age steals our vigor, skill, and strength-It is as though we are stuck in mud. Age makes attractive bodies unattractive. Age steals our glory and our strength. Age steals our happiness and subjects us to insults. Age takes our vigor; age begets death. Jen-nga-wa said: \"The pain of death is horrible but brief; how hor-rible is aging!\" Ga-ma-pa said: \"It is well that aging happens little by little. If it happened all at once, it would be intolerable.\" (iii) The suffering of illness Here there are also five points [to contemplate]: 1) Illness changes the nature of the body: the flesh wastes away, the skin dries out, and so forth. 2) Pain and anguish increase and are seldom absent: the elements of the body-water, earth, air, and fire-are not in equilibrium and fluctuate chaotically, causing physical torment, which in tum produces mental anguish. You spend night and day in this state. 3) There is no desire for attractive things: as you are told that desirable things harm those who are sick, you cannot indulge"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The Eight Types of Suffering 277 in them freely; [218] and you do not have the range of move-ments and postures that you would wish. 4) You must have recourse, however unwillingly, to unpleasant objects: the sick are forced to take unpalatable medicine, food, drink, and the like; and have to rely on harsh therapies that involve such things as being burned with fire or being pen-etrated with instruments. 5) You lose your vital energy: it is painful to realize that your illness is terminal. Reflect with care upon these points. As the Extensive Sport SiUra says:476 Hundreds of illnesses and the pain of rampant disease Afflict us, just as humans oppress wild animals. Regard the beings overwhelmed by old age and disease And quickly speak about escape from suffering. In deep winter, wind and great blizzards Take the vigor from the grasses, shrubs, trees, and herbs. In the same way, disease takes the vigor out of living beings; It breaks down their faculties, physical appearance, and strength. It will drain a great fortune in wealth and grain to the last. Disease constantly humiliates living beings; It harms them and is contemptuous of beauty. It torments them, like the sun beating down from the sky. (iv) The suffering of death Again, there are five points to contemplate: 1) You are separated from objects that are fine and attractive. 2) You are separated from close relatives who are fine and attractive. 3) You are separated from companions who are fine and attractive. 4) You are deprived of a body that is fine and attractive. 5) As you die, you experience terrible pain and anguish. Reflect on these repeatedly, until you become disenchanted. How do the first four of these constitute suffering? You suffer upon seeing that you are losing these four excellent things. The Ex-tensive Sport Sutra:477 You die and pass on to another life, and in so doing You are forever separated from people who are beautiful and beloved. [219]"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"278 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Like a leaf fallen from a tree, or the current of a river, You will never return and meet them again. Death makes the powerful weak. Death takes you away, as a river carries away a log. People go alone, unaccompanied, with no companion-Powerless because their karma has its effects. Death seizes myriad living beings, As sea-monsters seize swarms of creatures, As an eagle seizes a snake, or a lion an elephant, As fire takes hold of grass, trees, and swarming creatures. (v) The suffering of encountering what is unpleasant Here there are also five points to contemplate: 1) Merely encountering your enemies, for example, causes pain and anguish. 2) You dwell in fear of being punished by them. 3) You fear they will speak maliciously, without kind words. 4) You dread death. 5) You worry that you will go to a miserable realm after death for having acted in ways contrary to the teaching. Reflect on these. (vi) The suffering of separation from what is pleasant Again, there are five points to contemplate. When you are separated from a very dear relative, for example: 1) In your mind, sorrow arises. 2) In your speech, you lament. 3) You bring harm to your own body. 4) You are saddened, recalling and missing the good quali-ties of what you have lost. 5) Recourse is no longer available for what you have lost. Reflect on these. (vii) The suffering of not getting what you want Again, there are five points, similar to separation from what is pleas-ant. Seeking but not getting what you want means, for example, farming a field but reaping no harvest, or engaging in business but receiving no profits. The pain of disappointment comes from work-ing hard to get something that you long for, and then not getting it."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The Eight Types of Suffering 279 (viii) The suffering of the five appropriated aggregates The Buddha said, \"In brief, the five appropriated aggregates are suffering.\"478 Reflection on the meaning of this teaching again takes in five points. It is the nature of the five aggregates appropriated by karma and the afflictions to be: (1) vessels for future suffering; (2) vessels for suffering based on what presently exists; [220] (3) vessels for the suffering of pain; (4) vessels for the suffering of change; and (5) vessels for the suffering of conditionality. Reflect on these again and again. Here, with regard to the first point, you induce suffering in fu-ture lives by taking up these appropriated aggregates. As for the second, the appropriated aggregates form the basis for states, such as illness and old age, that are grounded in the already existing ag-gregates. The third and the fourth both come about because the appropriated aggregates are linked with dysfunctional tendencies toward these two types of suffering. As regards the fifth, the very existence of the appropriated aggregates constitutes the nature of the suffering of conditionality, because all of the compositional fac-tors which depend on previous karma and afflictions are the suf-fering of conditionality. This will be explained in detail in the sec-tion on the three sufferings.479 If you do not cultivate a genuine sense of disenchantment with cyclic existence-the nature of which is the appropriated aggre-gates-you will have no chance to develop a genuine mind intent on liberation, and there will be no way for you to develop great com-passion for living beings wandering through cyclic existence. Hence this reflection is extremely important, regardless of which vehicle-Mahayana or Hinayana-you enter. Even when you have devel-oped a sense of disenchantment with cyclic existence, follow flaw-less scriptures and authoritative commentaries and seek an exact understanding of them. Then, use prolonged and discerning ana-lytical meditation to bring about a powerful transformation of your mind. Thus, I have followed the well-founded presentation of the noble Asanga in explaining the Bhagavan's purpose in teaching the eight types of suffering as a way to understand the truth of suffering, the faults of cyclic existence."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"280 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Bo-do-wa said: As soon as we are born as anyone of the six types of beings, we are faced with the sufferings of sickness, death, and so forth.

While we are in cyclic existence there is no escaping it. If we are disgusted by it, then we must eliminate the process of birth. [221] To do this, we must eliminate its cause.

(i) The fault of uncertainty As you pass through cyclic existence, close relatives such as your father and mother become enemies in other lifetimes, while enemies become close relatives. Similarly, your father becomes your son and your son your father; and your mother becomes your wife and your wife your mother. Since there is nothing but a succession of such transformations, there is nothing that you can count on. The Friendly Letter:48o For those in cyclic existence there are no certainties Because fathers become sons, mothers become wives, Enemies become friends, And the converse happens as well."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"282 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Even in this life, enemies become friends and vice versa. The Tantra Requested by Subahu says:481 Within a short space of time, an enemy can become a friend And a friend can become an enemy. Likewise, either one may become indifferent, While those who were indifferent may become enemies Or intimate friends. Knowing this, the wise never form attachments. They give up the thought of delighting in friends And are content to focus on virtue. By meditating on this, you should check the arising of the attach-ment and hostility that come from discriminating between friends and enemies. Be aware that among the phenomena of cyclic exist-ence, absolutely nothing can be trusted. Become disenchanted. (ii) The fault of insatiability The Friendly Letter:482 Each of us has drunk more milk Than would fill the four oceans; yet Those in cyclic existence who act as ordinary beings483 [222] Are intent on drinking still more than that. Think about it: each living being has drunk so much mother's milk in the past, and yet-without training on a path to liberation-will drink that much again in the future. This is just an example. When you reflect on how you have no lack of experience with the won-ders and sufferings of cyclic existence, you should become disen-chanted. You indulge in pleasures in pursuit of satisfaction, yet, with worldly pleasures, you are never satisfied no matter how much you enjoy them. Hence, time after time your craving grows, and on that account you wander for ages through cyclic existence. For an im-measurably long period of time you will experience intolerable suffering, which those pleasures will not ameliorate in the least. The Friendly Letter:484 Just as a leper tormented by maggots Turns to fire for relief But finds no peace, so should you understand Attachment to sensual pleasures. Also in the Compendium of the Perfections it is said:485 You get what you want, Use it up, then acquire more,"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"And still you are not satisfied, What could be sicker than this? The Six Types of Suffering 283 And Candragomin's Letter to a Student says:486 What being has not come into the world hundreds of times? What pleasure has not already been experienced countless times? What luxury, such as splendid white yak-tail fans, have they not owned? Yet, even when they possess something, their attachment continues to grow. There is no suffering they have not experienced many times. The things they desire do not satisfy them. There is no living being that has not slept in their bellies. So why do they not rid themselves of attachment to cyclic existence? Think about this. Furthermore, you will become very disenchanted [with cycliC existence] if you reflect on what the Alleviating Sorrow (Soka-vinodana) says:487 Again and again in hells You drank boiling liquid copper-So much that even the water in the ocean Does not compare. [223] The filth you have eaten As a dog and as a pig Would make a pile far more vast Than Meru, the king of mountains. On account of losing loved ones and friends You have shed so many tears In the realms of cyclic existence That the ocean could not contain them. The heads that have been severed From fighting one another, If piled up, would Reach beyond Brahma's heaven. You have been a worm And, having been ravenous, you ate so much sludge That if it were poured into the great ocean It would fill it completely.

Remember the infinite bodies which, in the past, You wasted senselessly on account of desire. As many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges You failed to please the buddhas and ignored their teachings such as this. Even if you gained the vast wonders of cyclic existence, they would be illusory. Bear in mind the countless bodies you have wasted in the past, experiencing limitless and pointless suffering. Consider that it will continue this way unless you make an effort to put an end to it. Develop a sense of disenchantment. Jen-nga-wa said: Honorable teachers, how many bodies have you taken from be-ginningless time? Now, since you never practiced Mahayana teachings, you must apply yourselves assiduously. Sang-pu-wa (gSang-phu-ba) said: In this cyclic existence there are many turns of fortune for better and for worse; do not stake your hopes on them. Reflect until you give rise to this kind of thinking; after you have developed it, you must continually sustain it in meditation. (iii) The fault of casting off bodies repeatedly The Friendly Letter:489 Each of us has left a pile of bones That would dwarf Mount Meru. [224] For each living being, if the bones discarded upon taking up new bodies did not disappear, they would tower over even Mount Meru. (iv) The fault of repeated rebirth The Friendly Letter:490 If you looked for the limit of mothers by counting with earthen pellets The size of juniper berries, the earth would not suffice. Earlier scholars took this to mean that each pellet represents a living being who has been your mother, but this is incorrect. The Clear Words: Explanation of the \"Friendly Letter\"491 cites a sutra which indicates"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The Six Types of Suffering 285 that it refers to the line of matrilineal predecessors, from one's own mother to her mother, and so forth: For example, 0 monks, if someone took from this vast earth pel-lets the size of juniper berries and set them aside, saying, \"This is my mother, and this is my mother's mother,\" then, monks, the clay of this vast earth would be exhausted, yet the line of matri-lineal predecessors would not. Again, the reading of those former scholars is wrong because Nagarjuna's text says \"the limit of mothers.\" You should understand how this causes you to be disenchanted as follows. The Four Hundred Stanzas says:492 You cannot see the initial cause Of even a single effect; Seeing how vast the causes of even one effect are, Who would not be frightened? Candrakirti's commentary on this says:493 It is right to cultivate a constant sense of disenchantment, and a corresponding mode of conduct, in the face of this vast wilder-ness-cyclic existence-where movement is difficult on account of the dense forest of ignorance whose reaches cannot be mea-sured. (v) The fault of repeatedly descending from high to low The Friendly Letter:494 Having become Indra, worthy of the world's honor, you will still fall Once again to the earth because of the force of past karma. Even having become a universal monarch, You will once again become a slave for other beings in cyclic existence. Though you have long experienced the pleasures Of caressing the breasts and waists of divine women, You will once again encounter the unbearable sensations [225] Of the grinding, cutting, and flesh-tearing hell-devices. Having dwelled long on the peak of Mount Meru, Enjoying the pleasant touch of soft ground on your feet, Imagine undergoing the unbearable pain Of walking once again over hot coals and rotting corpses in hell. Having frolicked in beautiful groves And enjoyed the embraces of divine women,"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"286 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path You will arrive once again in the forests of hell, where the leaves Are swords that slice off ears, nose, hands, and legs. Though you have entered the Gently Flowing River With beautiful goddesses and golden lotuses, You will plunge once more in hell into scalding water-The unbearable waters of the Impassable River. Having gained the great pleasures of a deity In the realm of desire, or the detached happiness of Brahma,495 You will once again become fuel for the fires Of the Unrelenting Hell, suffering pain without respite. Having been a deity of the sun or the moon, Illuminating all the world with the light of your body, You will return once more to dense, black darkness, Where you cannot see even your own outstretched hand. The three devices for grinding, cutting, and tearing flesh are those of the Crushing, Black Line, and Extremely Hot Hells, respectively. To be attended by divine women means to be served by goddesses. The \"pleasures of deities in the desire realm\" refers to the deities in the desire realm from the Heaven of the Thirty-three and above. Here, the light of the sun and the moon is described in terms that are familiar to ordinary people, without distinguishing between the support-the palace of the deity-and what is supported-the de-ity; if you do distinguish them, then the light is the light of the pal-aces of the sun and moon. Considering all the ways that you can fall from high to low places-as illustrated by these examples-you should be disen-chanted with cyclic existence, because all of its wonders will col-lapse in the end. As the Bases of Discipline states:496 The end of accumulated things is depletion. The end of things that are high is a fall. [226] The end of meetings is separation. The end of life is death. (vi) The fault of having no companions The Friendly Letter:497 In this way, you will corne to grief. Therefore take light from the lamp of the three types of merit; Otherwise, you will go alone into endless darkness That neither sun nor moon can penetrate."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Six Types of Suffering 287 \"You will come to grief\" means \"Know that you must die as I have indicated before, and take the light of merit.\" \"The three types of merit\" refers either to physical, verbal, and mental virtue, or to the three foundations from which merit arises-generosity and so on. \"Endless darkness\" refers to the darkness of ignorance. In regard to having no companions, Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:498 This body comes forth whole, yet The bones and flesh that accompany it Will break apart and disperse. As this is so, Why mention others, such as loved ones? You are born alone. Also you die alone. As others cannot share your suffering, Of what use is the hindrance of loved ones? Thus, these six faults comprise three types: 1) In cyclic existence, there is no secure basis that you can count on. 2) However much you may indulge in its pleasures, they will not bring satisfaction in the end. 3) You have been caught in cyclic existence from beginning-less time. The first of these has four parts: 1) There is no security in obtaining a body, for you discard bodies repeatedly. 2) There is no security in agents of help or harm, for they are not certain. 3) There is no security in attaining a wonderful condition, for what is high becomes low. 4) There is no security in companions, for at death you go without companions. The third of these four refers to being reborn again and again; there is no limit to the stream of rebirths. Reflect on suffering under this threefold arrangement as well."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"19 FURTHER MEDITATIONS ON SUFFERING (c) Meditation on the three types of suffering (i) The suffering of change (ii) The suffering of pain (iii) The suffering of conditionality 2\" Reflection on specific sufferings (a) The suffering of human beings (b) The suffering of the demigods (c) Reflection on the suffering of the deities (i) The deities of the desire realm (a') The sufferings of dying and falling (1') The suffering of dying (2') The suffering of falling to lower realms (b') The suffering of anxiety (c') The sufferings of being cut, gashed, killed, and banished (ii) The deities of the form and formless realms (c) Meditation on the three types of suffering499 (i) The suffering of change [227] Pleasant feelings experienced by beings in cyclic existence are like the pleasure felt when cool water is applied to an inflamed boil or carbuncle: as the temporary feeling fades, the pain reasserts itself.

(ii) The suffering of pain When a painfully inflamed boil makes contact with an irritant such as salt water, it is agonizing. This is how you recognize the feeling of pain. Painful feelings like this constitute the suffering of pain, be-cause as soon as they arise the body and the mind are tormented, as in the case of kidney pain. Also, as explained above, the suffer-ing of pain is not just the feeling. (iii) The suffering of conditionality Contaminated neutral feelings are like an inflamed boil which is in contact with neither soothing nor irritating substances. Because these feelings coexist with dysfunctional tendencies, they consti-tute the suffering of conditionality, which, as explained above, does not refer to the feelings alone. Insofar as the suffering of condition-ality is affected by previous karma, as well as the afflictions, and coexists with seeds that will produce future suffering and affliction, it coexists with persistent dysfunctional tendencies. Thus, attachment increases when a pleasant feeling arises, and hostility increases when pain arises. Ignorance increases when you misapprehend the body-which is part of a dysfunctional situation that is neither pleasant nor painful-as permanent, when it is in fact impermanent. Attachment gives rise to suffering such as fu-ture rebirth in the five realms [the realms of the hell-beings, hun-gry ghosts, animals, humans, and deities]; hostility brings about suffering such as sorrow in this life, as well as the future suffering of miserable realms; while ignorance acts in such a way as to main-tain in existence the sufferings produced by the other two [attach-ment and hostility]. Therefore, attachment ceases when you see pleasant feelings as suffering. [228] In the case of painful feelings, hostility ceases when you consider that since these aggregates [of body and mind] are a collection of causes for suffering, painful feel-ings arise from them just as physical affliction does. In the case of neutral feelings, ignorance ceases when you see that they are im-permanent, exhaustible, and perishable in nature. In this way, you prevent the three feelings from giving rise to the three mental poi-sons. I have explained these points in accordance with Compendium of Determinations and the Levels of Yogic Deeds.

Though you have occasional moments when painful feeling is ab-sent, because the aggregates are firmly embedded in the dysfunc-tional tendencies of suffering and the afflictions, the suffering of conditionality is still present, and therefore myriad sufferings are just on the verge of arising in countless ways. Therefore, since the suffering of conditionality pervades all suffering and is the root of the other two types of suffering, meditate on it often in order to become disenchanted with it. Moreover, your current pleasant feelings-which cause attach-ment to grow-mostly arise only upon the relief of suffering; plea-sure does not exist naturally, independently of the removal of suf-fering. For example, if you suffer because of too much walking, a pleasant state of mind arises when you sit down. Then, as the ear-lier intense suffering fades, pleasure appears to arise gradually. Yet sitting is not naturally pleasant, because if you sit too long, suffer-ing arises again, just as before. Suppose that sitting and other pos-tures were causes of pleasure by their very nature. Just as suffering increases in proportion to your involvement with causes of suffer-ing, so should pleasure increase the longer you walk, sit,lie down, drink or eat, or stand in the sun or shade. However, it is clear that if you do any of these for too long, suffering is all that results. [229] For, as the Descent into the Womb Sidra says in the same vein:501 Nanda, the physical activities of walking, sitting, standing, or lying down must each be understood as suffering. If meditators analyze the nature of these physical activities, they will see that if they spend the day walking and do not rest, sit down, or lie down, they will experience walking exclusively as suffering and will experience intense, sharp, unbearable and unpleasant feelings. The notion that walking is pleasant will not arise. After discussing the other three physical activities in the same way, the text continues: Nevertheless, Nanda, because they break the continuity of suf-fering in one or the other of the physical activities, some other, new suffering arises; and this they take to be pleasure. Nanda, when this contaminated feeling of pleasure arises, it is only suf-fering that is arising; when it ends, it is only this nature of suffer-ing that ends. When it arises yet again, it is only compositional activity that arises; when it ends, it is only compositional activity that ends. Also, as Aryadeva's Four Hundred Stanzas says:502"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"292 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Pleasure, when it increases, Is seen to change into pain; Pain, when it increases, Does not likewise change into pleasure. 2\" Reflection on specific sufferings Of the six kinds of specific sufferings, I have already explained above the sufferings of the three miserable realms. (a) The suffering of human beings From what has been explained above, you should understand that the suffering of human beings consists of the pain of hunger and thirst, unpleasant sensations of heat and cold, and the suffering of searching for sustenance503 and becoming fatigued. It is also birth, old age, illness, death, and so on-the seven that I have already explained before.504 Furthermore, you should understand human suffering according to the following two citations. Vasubandhu's Discussion of the Requisite Collections (Sambhara-parikatha) says:505 It is apparent that humans also have All the sufferings of the miserable realms-Tormented by pain, they are like hell-beings; Deprived, they are like those in the Lord of Death's world [the hungry ghosts]. Humans also have the suffering of animals [230] In that the powerful use force To hurt and oppress the weak-These sufferings are just like a river. Some suffer from poverty; For others, suffering arises from discontent. The suffering of yearning is unbearable. All of them quarrel and can be killed. The Four Hundred Stanzas:506 For the privileged, pain is mental; For common people, it is physical. Day after day both types of pain Afflict this world. (b) The suffering of the demigods The Friendly Letter:507 Also, the demigods, by their very nature, experience great mental suffering"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Further Meditations on Suffering 293 Because of their hatred of the splendor of the deities. Though they are intelligent, they do not see the truth Because of the mental obscurations characteristic of this realm of rebirth. In other words, they are tortured by their unbearable envy of the deities' wealth. Because of this, they fight with the deities and en-dure many sufferings, such as having their bodies cut and split apart. They are intelligent, but they have mental obscurations, frui-tions of past karma, which make it impossible for them to see the truth from within their situation. The Mindfulness of the Excellent Teaching states that they are animals, but the Levels of Yogic Deeds places them in the realm of the deities. (c) Reflection on the suffering of the deities This is explained with regard to (1) the deities of the desire realm and (2) the deities of the form and formless realms. (i) The deities of the desire realm The sufferings of the desire reahn dei ties are considered in three parts: 1. The sufferings of dying and falling 2. The sufferings of anxiety 3. The sufferings of being cut, gashed, killed, and banished (a') The sufferings of dying and falling (1') The suffering of dying The Friendly Letter:508 Although the deities have great pleasure in heaven, The suffering of dying there is even greater than that. The wise who understand this cease to create Attachments for the perishable heavens. [231] Deities derive pleasure from indulging their sensual desires, yet greater than this is the tremendous suffering they experience while dying, when they become aware of the five signs of death, about which the same text says:509 Their bodies tum an unattractive color, Their cushions become uncomfortable, Their flower garlands wilt, and their clothing smells; An unaccustomed sweat breaks out over their bodies. The five signs that signal the deities in heaven, Foretelling their death and departure therefrom,"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"294 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Are similar to the signs That foretell death for humans on earth. (2') The suffering of falling to lower realms The Friendly Letter:510 They must take leave of the divine worlds. If their merit has run out, Then, powerless, they will become Animals, hungry ghosts, or denizens of hell. (b') The suffering of anxiety Deities with vast stores of merit gain the most desirable objects. Upon seeing them, deities of lesser merit become anxious and ex-perience great anguish and pain on this account. (c') The sufferings of being cut, gashed, killed, and banished When deities fight with demigods, they undergo the pain of hav-ing their limbs and minor extremities cut off, having their bodies split apart, and being killed. When their heads are cut off, they die, but their other limbs regenerate after being cut off or gashed, and they survive. As regards banishment, when there is a battle, the more powerful deities expel the weaker deities from their homes. Moreover, as Vasubandhu's Discussion of the Requisite Collections says:511 Deities who indulge in sensual pleasures Are not happy in mind-They are burned by an inner fire Sparked by the infection of sensual desire. How can there be happiness For those whose minds are distracted? Since their minds are not under control [232] And undistracted even for a moment, They are by nature disturbed and agitated. They will never be calm-Like a fire that has wood for fuel And that rages, whipped by the wind. And also: They are like invalids, not long recovered From an illness, who eat improperly and get sick again."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Further Meditations on Suffering 295 (ii) The deities of the form and formless realms The deities of the highest realms-the form and the formless-though they escape these sufferings, nevertheless die in possession of afflictions and obscurations. Because they have no control over their future dwelling place, even they suffer on account of dysfunc-tional tendencies. Moreover, as the Discussion of the Requisite Col-lections says:512 Those in the form or formless realms Are beyond the suffering of pain and the suffering of change. By nature they have the bliss of meditative concentration; They remain motionless for an eon. But even this is most assuredly not liberation; After they have counted on it, they will again fall. Though it may seem as though they have transcended The turbulence of the miserable realms, Yet, like birds soaring in the sky, They cannot stay forever, though they try-Like an arrow shot with the strength of a child, They will fall back down in the end. Just as butter lamps that burn for a long time Are in fact perishing in every moment, They are afflicted by the changes of The suffering of conditionality.

How the afflictions arise 2. How you thereby accumulate karma 3. How you die and are reborn a\" How the afflictions arise Karma and the afflictions are both necessary as causes for the cre-ation of cyclic existence, but the afflictions are primary. [233] For, just as a seed without moisture, soil, etc. will not produce a sprout, so in the absence of afflictions--even though you have accumulated immeasurable karma in the past-there will be no sprout of suffer-ing because the karma lacks the necessary cooperating conditions. A further reason afflictions are primary is because--even without previously accumulated karma-if afflictions are present, you im-mediately accumulate new karma, and will thereby appropriate aggregates in the future. Similarly, Dharmakirti's Commentary on the \"Compendium of Valid Cognition\" says:513 The karma of one who has transcended craving for existence Lacks the potency to project another birth Because its cooperating conditions are gone. and also: Because the aggregates will arise again, if you have craving. Consequently, it is very important to rely on a remedy for the af-flictions. Moreover, since this requires understanding the afflictions, you should become knowledgeable about the afflictions. There are four parts to this: 1. Identifying the afflictions 2. The order in which they arise 3. The causes of the afflictions 4. The faults of the afflictions I\" Identifying the afflictions Asanga's Compendium of Knowledge gives a general definition of an affliction: 514 An affliction is defined as a phenomenon that, when it arises, is disturbing in character and that, through arising, disturbs the mind-stream. Thus, when it is produced, it disturbs the mind-stream."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The Origin of Suffering 299 The specific definitions of the ten afflictions are as follows: 1) Attachment means noticing a pleasant or attractive exter-nal or internal object and desiring it. When attachment clings to its object and grows stronger, it is hard to tear yourself away from the object, just as it is difficult to remove oil which has soaked into a cloth. 2) Hostility means observing origins of suffering-such as liv-ing beings, pain, weapons, or thorns-and giving rise to a harsh, tormented mind that contemplates harming these objects. [234] 3) Pride means observing~ither internally or externally-qualities that are high, low, good, or bad, and, based on the reifying view of the perishing aggregates, allowing your mind to become inflated; you assume an aspect of superiority. 4) Ignorance means possessing the affliction of misunder-standing on account of a mind that is unclear about the nature of the four truths, karma and its effects, and the three jewels. 5) Doubt means considering those three-the four truths, karma and its effects, and the three jewels-and being uncer-tain whether they exist or are real. 6) The reifying view of the perishing aggregates is an afflictive intelligence that observes the appropriated aggregates and re-gards them as \"I\" or \"mine,\" that is, as the self or that which belongs to the self. Here, since \"perishing\" means imperma-nent and \"aggregates\" is plural,sIs the terms indicate that what are apprehended are simply impermanent and multiple phe-nomena; there is no permanent and unitary person. This is why it is called \"the view of the perishing aggregates.\" 7) An extremist view is an afflictive intelligence that observes the self as apprehended by the view of the perishing aggre-gates and regards that self either as permanent and eternal, or as subject to annihilation in such a way that there will be no rebirth from this life into a future life. 8) A belief in the supremacy of wrong views is an afflictive in-telligence that observes one of the three views-the view of the perishing aggregates, an extremist view, and a wrong view-along with a view-holder's aggregates on the basis of which such a view occurs, and regards such a view as supreme. 9) A belief in the supremacy of ethics and religious discipline is an afflictive intelligence which observes an ethical discipline that renounces faulty ethical discipline, or a religious discipline which requires certain forms of dress, manner, speech, and physical behavior, as well as the mental and physical aggregates"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"300 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path on the basis of which these forms of ethics and asceticism oc-cur, and regards them as cleansing you of sin, freeing you from afflictions, and removing you from cyclic existence. 10) Wrong view is an afflictive intelligence that denies the existence of things such as past and future lives or karma and its effects, or that believes that the cause of living beings is a divine creator or a primal essence, etc.516 I have explained these ten afflictions in accordance with the Com-pendium of Knowledge and Levels of Yogic Deeds and with Vasubandhu's Explanation of the Five Aggregates (Paiica-skandha-prakarmJa).517 [235] 2\" The order in which the afflictions arise One way to look at this is to consider ignorance as distinct from the view of the perishing aggregates. For example, when twilight falls on a coiled rope, its status as a rope will be unclear and some-one may imagine that it is a snake. Similarly, according to this view, the misapprehension of the aggregates as a self arises due to the darkness of ignorance, which prevents clarity about how the ag-gregates exist. The other afflictions then develop from this misap-prehension. On the other hand, if you hold that ignorance and the view of the perishing aggregates are identical, then the view of the perishing aggregates is itself the root of the afflictions. When the view of the perishing aggregates apprehends a self, discrimination arises between self and other. Once you have made that distinction, you become attached to what is associated with yourself and hostile toward that which pertains to others. As you observe the self, your mind also becomes inflated. You develop a belief that this very self is either eternal or subject to annihilation. You come to believe in the supremacy of a view of the self and the like, and you also come to believe in the supremacy of the detri-mental practices associated with such views. Similarly, you develop the wrong view that denies the existence of things such as the Teacher who taught selflessness and that which he taught-karma and its effects, the four truths, the three jewels, and so forth; or else you become doubtful as to whether such things exist or are real. Dharmakirti's Commentary on the \"Compendium of Valid Cognition \":51B Once there is a self, there is an idea of an other. On behalf of self and other, there is attachment and hostility. All of the faults come about In association with these."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"The Origin of Suffering 301 3\" The causes of the afflictions These are sixfold as presented in the Bodhisattva Levels: 1) Basis refers to the latent proclivity for afflictions. 2) Object refers to the appearance of objects conducive to the arising of an affliction. 3) Social context refers to the influence of bad friends and foolish people. 4) Explanation refers to listening to wrong teachings. 5) Habituation refers to the process of becoming accustomed to past afflictions. 6) Attention refers to incorrect attention that projects \"pleas-antness\" onto what has an unpleasant character, conceives an impermanent thing to be permanent, and the like [the four er-roneous conceptions that mistakenly consider things that are actually impermanent, painful, impure and lacking a self to be permanent, pleasant, pure and possessed of a self]. [236] 4\" The faults of the afflictions When an affliction arises, at first it completely afflicts your mind, causing you to err with regard to what you are observing, reinforc-ing your latent proclivities, and causing the same sort of affliction to recur. It may harm you, others, or both; it leads to misdeeds in this life, in future lives, or in both. It creates experiences of pain and anguish, as well as the sufferings of birth, and the like. It takes you far from nirval).a, your virtue is destroyed and your resources are depleted. In society you feel apprehensive, joyless, and devoid of confidence, while your notoriety spreads in all directions, and ex-cellent persons such as teachers and protectors rebuke you. You die with regret, your aims unfulfilled, and after death you are reborn into a miserable realm. Furthermore, as the Ornament for the Mahaycma Sutras says:519 Through afflictions, you destroy yourself, destroy other beings, and destroy your ethical discipline. After you have ruined your joy, you are shunned; your protec-tors and teachers rebuke you. Disreputable, you will be reborn in a leisureless condition. You suffer great anguish in losing the virtue you had or have yet to attain. Further, you should be aware of the faults as described in Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:520"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"302 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Enemies such as hatred and craving Have neither feet nor hands, And are neither brave nor intelligent. How, then, have they enslaved me? While they dwell within my mind, They are pleased to do me harm. They are not to be endured without anger-Tolerance of them is ridiculous! Even if all the deities and demigods Should rise up as my enemies, They cannot lead me or force me Into the fires of the Unrelenting Hell. But this powerful enemy, the afflictions, [237] Casts me in an instant into fires So hot that if they met even Mount Meru Not even ashes would remain. The enemy that is my afflictions Has lasted a long time, without beginning or end. No other enemy has the power To last for such a long time. Given appropriate service and attention Everyone helps you and makes you happy, But if you serve your afflictions They only inflict further suffering. You must have an understanding that accords with what Gon-ba-wa said: To eliminate afflictions, you must know the afflictions' faults, their characteristics, their remedies, and the causes for their arising. After you have recognized their faults, regard them as defective and consider them enemies. If you do not recognize their faults, you will not understand that they are enemies. Therefore, it is said that you should reflect on this, following what is said in the Or-nament for the Mahayana Sutras and Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds. And also: Study Vasubandhu and Asanga's texts on knowledge as well in order to understand the characteristics of the afflictions. At the least, study Vasubandhu's Explanation of the Five Aggregates.

Identifying the karma that you accumulate 2. How you accumulate karma I\" Identifying the karma that you accumulate (a) Karma that is intention The Compendium of Knowledge:521 What is intention? It is mental karma that involves the mind; it acts to engage the mind in virtuous, nonvirtuous, and ethically neutral activities. Thus, intention is mental karma, a mental process that moves and urges the mind with which it is associated toward objects. (b) Karma that is the intended action This is the physical and verbal action motivated by intention. [238] The Treasury of Knowledge:522 Karma is both intention and what intention produces. Intention is mental karma; What it produces are physical and verbal karma. The Vaibha~ikas divide physical and verbal karma into two types, the perceptible and the imperceptible, and hold that both types al-ways have form. Vasubandhu refutes this, asserting that physical and verbal karma are intentions that work along with perceptible physical and verbal behavior; thus, both forms of karma [intention and intended] are actually intentions.523 In general, karma is of three types: virtuous, nonvirtuous and ethically neutral, but here we are concerned only with the first two. Virtuous karma is of two types, contaminated and uncontaminated. I will only discuss contaminated virtuous karma, of which there are two types: that present in a noble being's mind and that present in an ordinary person's mind. Only the latter need concern us here. Nonvirtuous karma is karma that is nonmeritorious. Meritori-ous karma is virtuous karma in the minds of beings of the desire realm. Invariable karma is contaminated virtuous karma in the minds of beings of the form or formless realms. Similarly, the Trea-sury of Knowledge says:524"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"304 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Merit is the virtuous karma of the desire realm. Invariable karma produces the higher [deities'] realms. Why is it called invariable karma? In the desire realm, karma that should bear fruit while you are a deity may instead bear fruit while you are a human, an animal, or a hungry ghost; thus, its effect is variable. In the higher [deities'] realms, karma that should bear fruit at a certain level does not mature at levels other than that; thus, it is invariable. Thus, the Treasury of Knowledge:525 Why? Because the fruition of karma On these levels is not variable. 2\" How you accumulate karma In general, noble beings create and accumulate only virtuous karma, yet stream-enterers and once-returners [noble beings on lower levels] may accumulate nonvirtuous karma. However, such noble beings do not accumulate karma that would impel them into a cyclic existence of either happy or miserable realms. For, as Nagarjuna's Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way (Miila-madhyamaka-karika) says:526 [239] As the root of cyclic existence is compositional activity, The wise do not create activity that impels rebirth. Unwise are those who do. The wise do not because they see reality. Also, the master Vasubandhu says:527 When you have seen the truth, you are not impelled to rebirth. Consequently, as long as you operate under the influence of the conception of a self, you will accumulate karma that will impel you into cyclic rebirth. Once you have perceived reality-that is, self-lessness-you may still be reborn in cyclic existence by the power of former karma and afflictions, but you will not accumulate any new karma that can impel such rebirth. As Asanga's Levels of Yogic Deeds states, stream-enterers and once-returners do not assent to the conception of a self, but rather reject it-in the same way the strong overpower the weak. Hence every ordinary person-from the highest level of the supreme stage of the Mahayana path of preparation on down-accumulates karma that impels rebirth in cyclic existence. Accordingly, when those who are under the influ-ence of afflicted ignorance and the view of the perishing aggregates become physically, verbally, or mentally involved in nonvirtue-"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The Origin of Suffering 305 killing, for example-they accumulate nonmeritorious karma. Those who perform virtuous acts within the desire realm-such as practicing generosity or maintaining ethical discipline-accumu-late meritorious karma. Those who cultivate meditative states-such as meditative serenity-at the level of the meditative stabili-zations of the form realm or the formless absorptions accumulate invariable karma. Qualm: Consider someone who has seen the faults of all worldly wonders and is motivated by an aspiration for liberation. Does not this person create much virtuous karma? Moreover, consider the virtuous karma that is an intention similar to a wisdom conscious-ness accurately analyzing the meaning of selflessness. Is this a true origin, a cause of cyclic existence? Reply: In general, those who are on the paths of accumulation and preparation do accumulate ordinary karma that impels rebirth. [240] However, motivations based on thoughts such as those you describe, as well as virtuous karma similar to the wisdom that ana-lyzes selflessness, constitute the group of remedies for the craving for future existence. Further, in both their objective and subjective aspects, they operate in a manner contrary to the conception of self, the root of cyclic existence. Thus, they are not actual or usual true origins that impel rebirth. However, because they approximate ac-tual true origins leading to a future rebirth, they are included among true origins. Similarly, the Compendium of Determinations says:528 Question: Why are those mundane phenomena which eradicate the craving for rebirth, and which produce the supramundane path that is not directed toward rebirth, included under the truth of the origin? Reply: By nature, they are not directed toward rebirth in cy-clic existence. However, they approximate the physical, mental, and verbal good conduct which leads to rebirth. Consequently, you should understand that on this account they are included un-der the truth of the origin. Asanga says that after careful reflection on the faults of cyclic ex-istence, you give rise to a sense of disgust that can motivate virtu-ous karma which generates a supramundane path; yet this karma approximates an origin of suffering in cyclic existence. Therefore you must strive to develop this sense of disgust, as well as the wis-dom that knows selflessness.

Their minds then become absorbed in this and forget all else. If they are equally familiar with both virtue and non virtue, then they cannot stop remembering what they remember first, and cannot engage their minds in any-thing else. Those who have cultivated virtue seem to pass from darkness into light; as they die various pleasant and attractive images ap-pear, as though in a dream. They die comfortably, and, at the point"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"308 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of death, intense feelings of suffering do not arise in their bodies. For those who are currently doing what is right, the final agony of death is minimal. (b) Dying with a nonvirtuous mind Those who die with nonvirtuous minds, whether through remem-bering on their own or through being reminded by others, remem-ber non virtue, such as attachment, for as long as coarse discrimi-nation remains. At the point of death, they experience intense physical pain. When those who are currently cultivating nonvir-tue die, they experience signs foretelling the effects of the nonvir-tue they have engaged in. As if in a nightmare, many unpleasant images appear to them. They seem to pass from light to darkness. [243J When those who have committed serious nonvirtuous actions observe these unpleasant signs, they experience physical pain and their hair stands on end. They shake their hands and feet, void urine and excrement, reach up toward the sky, roll their eyes back, drool, and more. If they have been moderate in their nonvirtue, then not all of these things will happen-some will and some will not. Wrongdoers suffer terrible agony at the moment of death; such agony is found everywhere that beings are born, except among deities and hell-beings. At the time of death, whereupon discrimination will become unclear, beings are attached to the self with which they have long been familiar. After that, through the influence of attachment to the self, they think, \"I am ceasing to exist,\" and they crave embodiment. This causes the intermediate state. Attachment to the self also oc-curs among stream-enterers and once-returners, but as they inves-tigate it with wisdom they reject it rather than assent to it, the way a powerful person dominates a weak person. Attachment to self does not occur among nonreturners. (c) Dying with an ethically neutral mind Those who are currently cultivating neither virtue nor nonvirtue, or who have done neither, do not remember virtue and nonvirtue, either on their own or at the urging of others. At death they have neither pain nor pleasure. When you die with a virtuous mind, it lasts as long as there is coarse discrimination, but once subtle discrimination is activated, the virtuous mind stops and becomes an ethically neutral mind. At this point you cannot retrieve the virtue with which you had become familiar, nor can others remind you. As the same holds true"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"The Origin of Suffering 309 for nonvirtuous minds, all minds of death are ethically neutral af-ter the onset of subtle discrimination. [244] Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary529 says that both virtuous minds and nonvirtuous minds are clear, and thus incompatible with the ces-sation of coarse consciousness at death. 3\" Where heat gathers Among those who are currently cultivating nonvirtue, conscious-ness leaves the body coming down from the upper parts, which become cold first. When it reaches the heart, it leaves the body. The consciousness of someone who is currently cultivating virtue leaves coming up from the lower parts and the body becomes cold from the lower parts. In both cases consciousness leaves from the heart. The point at which consciousness first enters the fertilized ovum becomes the body's heart; consciousness finally leaves the body from where it first entered. Given that, at first the heat of the body either descends from the upper parts and gathers in the heart or ascends from the lower parts and gathers in the heart. After that, though Vasubandhu and Asanga do not say so, you should understand that in both cases the remain-ing heat in the body gathers into the heart from the other end of the body. 4\" How you reach the intermediate state after death As the consciousness leaves from that spot, as just explained, you die and reach the intermediate state immediately, just as one arm of a balancing scale tips up when the other arm tips down. As to its causes, the intermediate state is contingent upon (1) having become attached to your body and being filled with delight in your previ-ous worldly activities, and (2) karma-whether virtuous or non-virtuous. Furthermore, the being of the intermediate state possesses a complete set of sensory faculties-such as eyes-as well as the form of the body it will have in the realm into which it will be re-born. Until it takes rebirth, its vision is unimpeded, like divine vi-sion [a type of superknowledge], and its body as well is unimpeded, as though it had miraculous powers. The Treasury of Knowledge:530 It has the form which it will have in the \"prior time,\" Which is the time prior to death in the next life, Beginning with the moment of birth in the next life. Others of the same type or those with pure divine vision see it. It has miraculous karmic power"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"310 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path And all sensory faculties; it is unimpeded. It does not change; it feeds on odors. Vasubandhu means that the being of the intermediate state can be seen by beings there who are of its own type and by persons who have used meditation to attain the impeccable divine vision. [245J He also claims that once you reach the intermediate state for a cer-tain rebirth, you will not change to the intermediate form of any other rebirth. However, the Compendium of Knowledge holds that such changes do occur. As for the term \"prior time,\" the Treasury of Knowledge refers to four states: (1) from death until taking birth is the intermediate state; (2) the first moment of taking birth is the birth state; (3) from the second moment of life up to the last moment of death is the state of the prior time; and (4) the last moment of death is the death state. The state of the prior time is \"prior\" in relation to the death state in the next rebirth of the being of the intermediate state. Some claim mistakenly that the being of the intermediate state has the shape of the body from its previous life. There are also those who claim-in view of Asanga's explanation of this being's physi-cal shape in its next life-that it is in the image of the body from its former life for three-and-one-half days and in the image of the body it will possess in its next life for three-and-one-half days. In the absence of any accurate sources, such assertions are simply fabri-cations. The Levels of Yogic Deeds says that the being of the interme-diate state does not desire its former body since its consciousness does not remain there. Hence the assertion that it becomes disturbed upon seeing its former body is also a fabrication. The intermediate state appears to those who have cultivated nonvirtue as like a black blanket or the pitch-black darkness of night, while to those who have cultivated virtue it is like a white cloth or a moonlit night. You see beings of the intermediate state who are the same type as yourself, as well as the place where each of you will be reborn. The Descent into the Womb SiUra describes the color differences in the intermediate state:S31 For someone who is to be reborn a hell-being, the intermediate state is like a charred log; for one to be reborn an animal it is like smoke; for one to be reborn a hungry ghost, it is like water; for one to be reborn a deity of the desire realm and a human, it is like gold; for one to be reborn a deity of the form realm, it is white. There is an intermediate state when you are born into the two lower realms [the desire and form realms] from the formless realm,"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"The Origin of Suffering 311 but when you are born into the formless realm from the two lower realms, you attain the aggregates of a formless being immediately upon dying; there is no intermediate state. [246] In the classic texts that are reliable sources there is no description of any other spe-cial cases where there is no intermediate state. Consequently, with respect to the assertion that there is a direct transition upward [to a heaven] or downward [to a hell], it is wrong to claim that there is no intermediate state. The Descent into the Womb Satra says that beings of the interme-diate state who are to be reborn as deities ascend; those to be re-born as humans move straight forward; and those to be reborn as wrongdoers move with their heads lowered and their eyes cast downward. It seems that this last part is meant to describe the in-termediate states for the three miserable realms. The Treasury of Knowledge Auto-commentary:532 The three-humans, hungry ghosts, and animals-each move in their own way. With regards to'life span, if a being of the intermediate state has not found the conditions for rebirth, it may remain for any length of time up to seven days. Once it has found such conditions, its life span is not definitely seven days. If it does not find the conditions for rebirth within seven days, it assumes another body within the intermediate state. It may stay in the intermediate state from one to seven weeks; however, as it certainly will have found the condi-tions for rebirth within that time, it stays no longer than that. Since the texts that are reliable sources do not describe a longer life span than this, the claim that the being of the intermediate state may stay longer is incorrect. A being of the intermediate state that is to be reborn as a deity, for instance, may die after seven days and either again reach the intermediate state of a deity or else reach the intermediate state of a human or some other form. This is possible because a change in its karma can transform the seeds for its intermediate state. The same holds for other beings of the intermediate state as well. 5\" How you then take rebirth If a being of the intermediate state is to be born in a womb, it ob-serves beings of the same type as itself at its future birthplace. It then wishes to gaze at them, play with them, and so forth, and de-sires to reach this place. It misperceives its father's semen and its mother's blood as its parents lying together-its parents are not"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"312 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path actually lying together at this time, yet, as if in an illusion, it sees them lying together-and becomes attached. If it is to be born female, it turns away from the woman and desires the man, wanting to lie with him. If it is to be born male, it turns away from the man and desires the woman, wanting to lie with her. [247J In this way, as the Levels of Yogic Deeds explains, it does not see its actual parents-it sees them lying together through misperceiving the semen and blood. Having conceived such a desire, the being of the intermediate state draws closer and closer to the man and woman, eventually arriving at a point where it cannot see any part of their bodies ex-cept for their genitals. Angry at this sight, it dies and is reborn. Moreover, the mother and the father generate desire, which be-comes intense for a period, at the end of which a gelatinous semen is emitted. Then drops of semen and blood invariably issue forth from the two of them, mixing within the mother's reproductive tract, then congealing like the skin on the top of boiled milk that has been allowed to cool. At this point, the intermediate state of the being who is to be reborn ends, and this being's fundamental consciousness enters the congealed mass. The force of this consciousness brings together a developed combination of blood and semen that is conducive to producing the sensory faculties, as well as a mixture of the former congealed blood and semen and subtle traces of the four great ele-ments that are the causes of the five sensory faculties. These traces are something that is other than the congealed blood and semen. Something that has sensory faculties and that is other than what was formerly there arises. After the consciousness has entered, at this point it is called \"rebirth.\" Those who do not accept that a fun-damental consciousness exists assert that the mental consciousness takes rebirth. If the being of the intermediate state has accumulated little merit, it is born into a low class. As it dies and enters the womb, it hears a loud clamor and sees itself entering a marsh, a thick forest, or some other such place. If it is currently cultivating virtue, it is born into an elite class. It hears peaceful and pleasant sounds, and sees itself entering a mansion, palace, or the like. This being then remains in the womb for thirty-eight weeks and there develops all of the limbs and extremities. Four days later, it is born. According to the Descent into the Womb Satra:533 The fetus is fully developed after nine months or more have passed; at eight months it is ahnost fully developed. [248J At six or seven months it is not fully developed, as its limbs are not complete."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"The Origin of Suffering 313 Study the Descent into the Womb SlUra for details on these stages of development. If the being of the intermediate state does not have a desire to go to a birthplace, it will not migrate there, and having not done so, will not be reborn there. Take, for example, the case of those who have committed and accumulated karma for rebirth in a hell, like those who have no vow against activities such as butchering sheep or poultry or marketing hogs. In these peoples' intermediate state they see, as if in a dream, sheep and such at their future birthplace, and rush there, driven by their delight in their former habits. Then anger is aroused at the forms which attracted them to the birthplace, at which point their intermediate state ends, and they are reborn. Hungry ghosts with goiters, and others who are similar to hell-beings, take rebirth in a like manner. If the being of the intermediate state is to be reborn as an animal, hungry ghost, human, desire-realm deity, or form-realm deity, it observes at its birthplace delightful beings similar to itself. Then, conceiving a liking and a desire for that place, it migrates there and becomes angry upon seeing the birthplace, at which time its inter-mediate state ends, and it is reborn. This is according to the Levels of Yogic Deeds. Rebirth in hell for those who are not people like those mentioned above-persons who have no vow, such as poultry butchers and hog sellers-occurs in a similar fashion. The Treasury of Knowledge says:534 You desire smells, places, or other things. In his commentary on this Vasubandhu explains535 that if the being of the intermediate state is to be reborn from heat and moisture, it craves smells, while if it is to be reborn spontaneously, it desires a place and is subsequently reborn there. It further explains that if this being is to be reborn in a hot hell, it craves warmth, while if it is to be born in a cold hell, it longs to be cool. Egg-birth is explained similarly to womb-birth. I have followed the Levels of Yogic Deeds in explaining how you die and are reborn in unexceptional cases.536"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"21 THE TWELVE FACTORS OF DEPENDENT-ARISING b' Reflection from the viewpoint of the twelve dependent-arisings l' The division into twelve factors 2' Abbreviated classification of the factors 3' The number of lifetimes required to complete all twelve factors 4' How their significance is summarized ----8En3B-----b' Reflection from the viewpoint of the twelve dependent-arisings The second part of the method for developing the mind intent on liberation is to reflect on the twelve aspects of dependent-arising. This topic has four parts: 1. The division into twelve factors 2. Abbreviated classification of the factors 3. The number of lifetimes required to complete all twelve factors 4. How their significance is summarized I' The division into twelve factors [249] The twelve factors of dependent-arising are: (1) Ignorance The Treasury of Knowledge:537 Ignorance is like animosity and falsehood."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"316 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Animosity and falsehood refer neither to the absence of friendship and truth, nor to what is different from these two, but rather to the classes of phenomena that are directly antithetical to and incompat-ible with friendship and truth. Likewise, ignorance also refers nei-ther to the absence of that cognition which is the remedy for igno-rance nor to what is other than this, but to the classes of phenomena that are directly antithetical to and incompatible with cognition. Regarding this, the great scholar Dharmakirti asserts that \"Here, the remedy-cognition-is the cognition of the real, the meaning of the selflessness of persons. Therefore, its antithesis is the reifying view of the perishing aggregates, the conception of a self in per-sons.\" Along with this interpretation, which sees ignorance as a mis-apprehension of the meaning of reality, there is a second view, held by the scholar Asanga and his brother Vasubandhu, who assert that ignorance is merely confusion about the meaning of reality. In brief, they say that ignorance is a mind that does not know its object, but also that it is not a misconception. However, Dharmakirti on the one hand, and Asanga and Vasubandhu on the other, are alike in asserting that the wisdom that knows selflessness is the principal remedy for ignorance. Asanga's Compendium of Knowledge states that there are two types of confusion: confusion about karma and its effects, and confusion about the meaning of reality. Through the first you accumulate compositional activities for rebirth in miserable realms; through the second you accumulate the compositional activities for rebirth in happy realms. (2) Compositional activity Compositional activity is karma. There are two kinds of karma: nonmeritorious karma, which impels miserable rebirths, and meri-torious karma, which impels happy rebirths. The latter is further divided into two types: meritorious karma, which impels happy rebirths into the desire realm, and invariable karma, which impels happy rebirths into the higher [deities'] realms. (3) Consciousness In the siitras the Buddha speaks about the six types of conscious-ness. [250] Nonetheless, here the principal consciousness is the fun-damental consciousness, according to those who assert that such a consciousness exists, or the mental consciousness, according to those who do not assert this."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"The Twelve Factors of Dependent-Arising 317 Further, you become entangled in and accumulate nonvirtuous karma through your ignorance of the fact that the suffering of pain arises from nonvirtue. These latent karmic propensities infuse your consciousness. The consciousness of the lifetime in which this hap-pens is \"the consciousness of the causal period,\" while that which enters the birthplace in a miserable realm, in the future and in de-pendence on the causal period consciousness, is the\" consciousness of the effect period.\" Likewise, due to the power of your confusion about the reality of selflessness, you perceive happy realms to be happy, not understand-ing that they are actually miserable. Through such misperceptions, you accumulate meritorious and invariable karma. The conscious-ness of the lifetime in which you accumulate such karma is the\" con-sciousness of the causal period,\" while that which, in dependence on this, enters a happy rebirth in either the desire realm or the higher [deities'] realms is \"the consciousness of the effect period.\" (4) Name-and-form \"Name\" is the four [of the five] aggregates that are nonphysical: feeling, discrimination, compositional factors, and consciousness. As for the fifth aggregate, form, if you are reborn in a formless realm, you have no actual form, only the seed of form. Thus, the \"form\" in the term \"name-and-form\" applies to any form, such as the fer-tilized ovum, that is appropriate to any situation other than the formless realm. (5) Six sources If you are born from a womb, four sources-the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue-are formed through the further development of \"name,\" [that is, consciousness] and the oblong mass of the fertil-ized ovum into which consciousness initially enters. The physical and mental sources, however, exist from the time of the fertilized ovum-the time of name-and-form. If you are born spontaneously, there are no such stages, since your sources form simultaneously with your entering rebirth. However, for those born from eggs or for those born from moisture, the ex-planation is similar to the explanation of those born from a womb, with the exception of the word \"womb.\" This is explained in the Levels of Yogic Deeds. This being the case, once name-and-form are established, you have an actual body. [251] When the six sources are established, the"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"318 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path experiencer has been created, because the particulars of the body have formed. The five physical sources do not exist in the formless realm. (6) Contact When sensory object, sensory faculty, and consciousness come to-gether, you distinguish three types of objects-attractive, unattrac-tive, and neutral. The passage where a sutra says \"caused by the six soun;es\"538 refers to sensory objects as well as consciousnesses. (7) Feeling Corresponding to contact's discrimination of three types of objects, there occur three sorts of feelings-pleasant, painful, and neutral. (8) Craving This means both craving not to be separated from pleasant feelings and craving a separation from painful feelings. The statement in a sutra that \"craving is caused by feeling\"539 means that feelings ac-companied by ignorance cause craving. Where there is no igno-rance, craving does not occur, even if feelings are present. This being the case, contact is the experiencing of the object and feeling is the experiencing of birth or the fruition of karma. Hence, when these two are complete, experience is complete. There are three types of craving, one for each of the three realms. (9) Grasping Grasping refers to yearning after and attachment to four types of objects: (1) holding onto what you want: yearning after and attach-ing to the sensuous, forms and sounds, for example; to bad views (excluding the reifying view of the perishing aggre-gates); to ethical discipline associated with bad views and bad conduct; and to the view of the perishing aggregates; (2) holding onto views; (3) holding onto ethical discipline and conduct; and (4) holding onto assertions that there is a self. (10) Potential existence In the past, compositional activity infused your consciousness with a latent propensity, that, when nurtured by craving and grasp-ing, became empowered to bring forth a subsequent existence."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"The Twelve Factors of Dependent-Arising 319 \"Existence\" is a case of calling a cause [an activated propensity] by the name of its effect [the subsequent rebirth]. (11) Birth Birth refers to consciousness initially entering one or another of the four types of rebirth. (12) Aging-and-death Aging is the maturation and transformation of the [mental and physical] aggregates. Death is the casting aside of the aggregates' continuum. 2' Abbreviated classification of the factors [252] The Compendium of Knowledge:540 What sort of categories do you obtain by abbreviating the factors? There are four types: the projecting factors, the projected factors, the actualizing factors, and the actualized factors. What are the projecting factors? Ignorance, compositional ac-tivity, and consciousness. What are the projected factors? Name-and-form, the six sources, contact, and feeling. What are the actu-alizing factors? Craving, grasping, and existence. What are the actualized factors? Birth, aging, and death. Qualm: Well then, do the two types of causality-one with re-spect to projection and the other with respect to actualization-dem-onstrate one instance of causality wherein one person takes rebirth or do they demonstrate two instances? If the former, it would be incorrect to claim that the actualizing factors, craving and so on, occur after the establishment of the group of factors beginning with resultant period consciousness and ending with feeling [the pro-jected factors]. If the latter, there would be no ignorance, composi-tional activity, or causal period consciousness [projecting factors] in the latter cycle of causality [the ordering of projection], and no craving, grasping, or existence [actualizing factors] in the former cycle of causality [the ordering of actualization]. Reply: There is no such fault, because, whatever is projected by the projecting causes [ignorance, compositional activity, and conscious-ness] must be created by the actualizing causes [craving, grasping, and existence]. When what is projected [name-and-form, the six sources, contact, and feeling] has been actualized, it is that very thing, the projected, that is designated as being born, aging, and dying. Qualm: Well then, what is the point of presenting two cycles of causality?"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"320 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Reply: Such a presentation demonstrates that the characteristics of the true sufferings that are the effects of projection differ from those that are the effects of actualization. The former [conscious-ness of the effect period, name-and-form, the six sources, contact, and feeling] are dormant at the time of projection. Since they have not actually been established, they will only become suffering in the future. However, the latter [birth, aging, and death] are situa-tions in which the suffering has been actualized, and hence are suffering in this lifetime. Moreover, the two cycles of cause and effect were presented for the sake of demonstrating that the effect-taking rebirth-has two causes: projecting causes and causes that actualize what has been projected [by the projecting causes]. [253] The Levels of Yogic Deeds states the reason for this:541 Given that the factors of birth and aging-and-death and the group of factors beginning with resultant period consciousness and end-ing with feeling are phenomena with shared characteristics, why have they been taught to be of two types? This is done (1) in or-der to demonstrate the different characteristics of things that bring suffering and (2) in order to demonstrate the distinction between projection and actualization. And also: Among the factors, how many are both included within true suf-ferings and become sufferings in this lifetime? There are two: birth and aging-and-death. How many are just included within true sufferings and will only become sufferings in the future? The ones that are dormant-the group of factors beginning with [resultant period] conscious-ness and ending with feeling. Therefore, the two factors of (1) craving, which is an actualizing fac-tor, and (2) feeling, which gives rise to this craving, are not in the same sequence of dependent-arising. The feeling that gives rise to craving is an effect of some other sequence of dependent-arising. Projecting and being projected should be understood by way of four considerations: 1) What has been projected? The four-and-a-half factors be-ginning with resultant period consciousness and ending with feeling have been projected. 2) What has done the projecting? Compositional activity, which is dependent on ignorance, has done the projecting."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"The Twelve Factors of Dependent-Arising 321 3) How has a projection occurred? Projection has occurred by means of latent karmic propensities being infused in the causal period consciousness. 4) \"Projected\" means having created the effects [resultant period consciousness, name-and-form, sources, contact, and feeling] conducive to actualization once the actualizers, such as craving, are present. The actualizers and the actualized should be understood by way of three considerations: 1) What does the actualizing? It is done by grasping, which is caused by craving. 2) What is actualized? Birth and aging-and-death are actu-alized. 3) How does actualization occur? Actualization occurs by means of the empowerment of the latent karmic propensities that were infused in consciousness by compositional activity. Vasubandhu, in his Explanation of the Divisions of Dependent-Arising (Pratitya-samutpiidiidi-vibhanga-nirdeSa ),542 took the factor of birth as the only actualized factor and then taught aging-and-death to be the faults of these factors of projection and actualization. [254] This being the case, actualization should be understood as fol-lows: nonvirtuous compositional activity that is motivated by ig-norance about karma and its effects deposits latent propensities of bad karma in the consciousness. This makes ready for actualiza-tion the group of factors of a miserable rebirth that begins with the resultant period consciousness and ends with feeling. Through re-peated nurturing by craving and grasping, these latent propensi-ties are empowered, and birth, aging, and so forth will be actual-ized in subsequent miserable rebirths. Alternatively, motivated by ignorance about the meaning of self-lessness, meritorious compositional activity-such as ethical dis-cipline within the desire realm-or invariable compositional activ-ity-such as the cultivation of meditative serenity within the higher [deities'] realms-deposits latent propensities of good karma in the consciousness. This makes ready for actualization the group of fac-tors beginning with resultant period consciousness and ending with feeling for, respectively, a happy rebirth in the desire realm or a re-birth as a deity in the higher realms. Through repeated nurturing by craving and grasping, these latent propensities are empowered,"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"322 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path and subsequently birth and so forth will be actualized in those happy rebirths. The twelve factors, moreover, are subsumed under three paths-those of afflictions, karma, and sufferings. As the wise Nagarjuna said:543 The first, the eighth, and the ninth are afflictions. The second and the tenth are karma. The remaining seven are sufferings. The Rice Seedling Satra (Stili-stamba-satra) mentions four causes which subsume the twelve factors of dependent-arising.544 It ex-plains that when the seeds of consciousness sown in the field of karma by ignorance are subsequently moistened by the water of craving, they give rise to the sprout of name-and-form in the mother's womb. 3' The number of lifetimes required to complete all twelve factors While it is possible for countless eons to go by between the project-ing and the projected factors, it is also possible for the projected factors to be actualized in the very next lifetime, with no interven-ing lifetime. Since the actualizing factors [craving, grasping, and existence] and the actualized factors [birth and aging-and-death] occur without an intervening lifetime, it is possible, at the shortest, to complete all twelve factors in two lifetimes. [255] You might, for example, in a lifetime such as this one first accumulate karma that results in rebirth as a deity as well as the subsequent experience of a deity's life and resources. When this occurs, two-and-a-half fac-tors-ignorance, compositional activity, and consciousness of the causal period-as well as craving, grasping, and existence (up to the point of death) are completed in this lifetime. In the subsequent lifetime, the four-and-a-half projected factors [consciousness of the resultant period, name-and-form, the six sources, contact, and feel-ing] and the two actualized factors [birth and aging-and-death] will be completed. Even at the longest, completion of all twelve factors will be de-layed no longer than three lifetimes, for the actualizers [craving, grasping, and existence], the two actualized factors [birth and ag-ing-and-death], and the three projecting factors [ignorance, com-positional activity, and consciousness] all require their own life-times, while the projected factors [name-and-form, the six sources, contact, and feeling] are included in the lifetime of the actualized factors. Furthermore, though many lifetimes may intervene between"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"The Twelve Factors of Dependent-Arising 323 the projectors and the actualizers, they are not lifetimes of their own particular cycle of dependent-arising, but are rather lifetimes of other cycles of dependent-arising. Among these calculations of two or three lifetimes, the lifetimes of the intermediate state have not been reckoned separately. Thus, even during the lifetime in which the resultant factors have been actualized, there is no self that is the person who accumulates karma or experiences its results. Rather, as previously explained, there are resultant factors, which are themselves merely phenom-ena, arising from causal factors, which are themselves merely phe-nomena. Not understanding this process of cyclic existence and being confused about it, you posit a self. Desiring your\" self\" to be happy, you physically, verbally, and mentally engage in virtue and nonvirtue for that purpose, whereby you again fuel the process of cyclic existence. Therefore, the two karmic factors [compositional activity and existence] arise from the three afflictive factors [igno-rance, craving, and grasping], and from them, the seven suffering factors [consciousness, name-and-form, sources, contact, feeling, birth, and aging-and-death] arise. Afflictions arise again out of the seven sufferings, and-as before-you pass through cyclic exist-ence. Thus, the wheel of existence turns without interruption. The master Nagarjuna says in his Heart of Dependent-Arising: From the three arise the two; From the two arise the seven, and again from the seven Arise the three. The wheel of existence Itself repeatedly turns. When you reflect on your wandering in such a way through cyclic existence, the twelve factors of dependent-arising are the best method for generating disenchantment with cyclic existence. Con-template your projecting karma, the virtuous and nonvirtuous karma that you have accumulated over countless eons, that has neither issued forth fruitions nor been eradicated by antidotes. [256] When craving and grasping in the present lifetime nurture them, you wander through happy or miserable realms under their con-trol. Arhats have immeasurable projecting karma accumulated when they were ordinary beings, but are free of cyclic existence because they have no afflictions. Once you have reached a firm con-viction about this, you will hold the afflictions to be enemies and will make an effort to eradicate them. With regard to this, the great spiritual friend Pu-chung-wa en-gaged in mental training based solely on the twelve factors of"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"324 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path dependent-arising and made the stages of the path simply a reflec-tion on the progression through and cessation of these factors. That is, he explained that reflection on the progression through and ces-sation of the twelve factors of miserable realms is the teaching for persons of small capacity and then reflection on the progression through and cessation of the twelve factors of the two happy realms is the teaching for persons of medium capacity. The teaching for persons of great capacity is to assess their own situation according to these two practices [of persons of small and medium capacities]. They then develop love and compassion for living beings, who have been their mothers and have wandered through cyclic existence by way of the twelve factors, train themselves in the wish to become a buddha for the sake of these beings, and learn the path to this end. 4' How their significance is summarized You should understand well, as explained above, how cyclic exist-ence-the aggregates of suffering-is formed through the power of its origin-karma and the afflictions-and, in particular, how the wheel of existence turns in the context of the twelve factors. Un-derstanding this and becoming familiar with it destroys the unbear-able gloom of confusion-the root of all problems. It eradicates all mistaken views holding external and internal compositional activi-ties to arise causelessly or from incompatible causes. It increases the precious wealth of the treasury of the Conqueror's teachings, and it is what motivates you toward the path to liberation through exact knowledge of the characteristics of cyclic existence and in-tense disenchantment with them. [257] It is the best means for acti-vating the latent propensities by which you will attain the sublime state of a noble being. Thus, the Tantra Requested by Subahu says:545 The path of dependent-arising destroys ignorance. The Rice Seedling Satra states that when you understand dependent-arising well, you put an end to all bad views that take as their ob-ject the beginning, the end, or the present. Master Nagarjuna said:546 This dependent-arising is the profound Treasure in the storehouse of the Conqueror's speech. The Bases of Discipline547 states that it was the custom of the ex-cellent pair Sariputra and Maudgalyayana occasionally to travel among the five kinds of beings. After they had traveled there, they"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"The Twelve Factors of Dependent-Arising 325 would return to Jambudvipa and recount the sufferings of these beings to the four types of the Buddha's followers. Some among the followers lived either with or near some per-sons who disdained pure conduct. The followers brought them before the excellent pair, who instructed them in these accounts of the sufferings of other realms. As a result of this instruction, they came to delight in pure conduct and were brought to a higher un-derstanding as well. The Teacher, seeing this, questioned Ananda, who informed him of the reasons, whereupon the Buddha said, \"Because there will not always be teachers like this excellent pair, make a painting in the gate house of a five-part wheel of cyclic existence, around the cir-cumference of which are the twelve dependent-arisings in both forward and reverse progressions.\" The wheel of existence was then drawn. On another occasion, a painting of the Buddha was to be sent to King Udrayat:ta. Before it was sent, the twelve dependent-arisings in forward and reverse progressions were written in verse at the bottom. The king memorized this, and then, at dawn, sitting with legs crossed and body straight, concentrated his attention upon virtue. By focusing upon the two processes of dependent-arising, he achieved the sublime state of a noble being."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"22 THE ATTITUDE OF A PERSON OF MEDIUM CAPACITY b) The measure of the determination to be free c) Dispelling misconceptions b) The measure of the detennination to be free You must understand in detail the characteristics of cyclic existence, both by way of suffering and its origin and by way of the twelve factors of dependent-arising. [258] Once you understand these char-acteristics, you will develop a desire to abandon and to quell suf-fering and its origin. At this point, although you may have a simple determination to be free, you should not be satisfied merely with this. Hence, Candrakirti's Commentary on the \"Sixty Stanzas ofRea-soning\" (Yukti-?a?tikii-vrtti) says: Once we are certain that living in the three levels of cyclic exist-ence-impermanence's blazing fire-is like entering a burning house, we want to escape it. And, as cited previously:548 Just as, when a chance arises For prisoners to flee from prison ... Develop an attitude about cyclic existence like those who feel aver-sion for their confinement in a blazing house or a prison, and want"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"328 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to escape. Then progressively increase this feeling of aversion and desire to escape. Sha-ra-wa described a superficial determination to be free as being like when you pour powder into inferior beer; the powder forms just a thin layer on the surface. If your ability to see the un-desirability of true origins-the causes of cyclic existence-is su-perficiallike this, then your search for liberation, the cessation of suffering and its origin, will be the same. Likewise, your desire to attain the path to liberation will be mere words. Thus, you will not be able to develop either the compassion that cannot bear to see the sufferings of living beings in cyclic existence or the uncontrived spirit of unsurpassed enlightenment that instills you with strength. Hence, your understanding of the Mahayana will also be merely intellectual. Therefore, you must practice these teachings for the person of medium capacity and regard them as crucial instructions. c) Dispelling misconceptions Qualm: Although it is appropriate in the Hinayana to cultivate dis-enchantment with cyclic existence, it is inappropriate for bodhi-sattvas, for, if bodhisattvas were to cultivate intense disgust and disenchantment with cyclic existence, they would be like the sravakas and fall into an extreme of peace, having become displeased with their involvement in cyclic existence. [259] As the Sidra ofShow-ing the Tathagata's Inconceivable Secret states:549 Bodhisattvas, thinking of the maturation of living beings, view cyclic existence as beneficial. Accordingly, they do not view great nirvcll).a [liberation] as beneficial to the maturation of beings. And further: Were bodhisattvas to fear involvement in cyclic existence, they would fall to a destitute place. And also: Bhagavan, whereas the sriivakas fear involvement in cyclic exist-ence, bodhisattvas voluntarily take innumerable rebirths in cy-clic existence. Response: This is a great error that misconstrues the sutra's mean-ing. For, the sutra passage that says, \"Thus, bodhisattvas should not become disenchanted with cyclic existence,\" does not teach bodhisattvas not to be disgusted with the sufferings of birth, ag-ing, illness, death, and so on-the result of our wandering through"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"The Attitude of a Person of Medium Capacity 329 cyclic existence under the influence of our karma and afflictions. Rather, this slltra teaches joyous perseverance. In order to train in the bodhisattvas' activities for the sake of others until the end of cyclic existence, bodhisattvas must put on armor [courage]. Once they do this, even if all the sufferings of all beings were collected and the bodhisattvas constantly experienced them mentally and physically, they would still persevere joyously, delighting in the magnificent deeds that help others, without becoming disenchanted with or frightened by sufferings. Thus, the Buddha said that bodhi-sattvas must not be disenchanted with cyclic existence. The master Candrakirti says: Bodhisattvas, who take on the sufferings of all beings moment by moment until the end of cyclic existence, do not fear harm to their bodies or minds. Bodhisattvas, who take on the sufferings of all beings simultaneously until the end of cyclic existence, delight in this activity. Each instant of such joyous perseverance acts as the cause whose effect produces boundless collections of wealth, bringing omniscience to all beings. Once bodhisattvas understand this, it is appropriate for them to take hundreds of rebirths. In order to emphasize this point, Candrakirti then cites the afore-mentioned slltra passages from the Satra of Showing the Tathiigata's Inconceivable Secret. [260] This same slltra states that cyclic existence should be viewed as beneficial because bodhisattvas gain happiness proportionate to the effort they make when they strive for the welfare of living beings. Hence, the Buddha says that not being disenchanted with cyclic ex-istence means not being disenchanted with accomplishing the good of living beings in cyclic existence, as well as enjoying this activity. When you wander through cyclic existence by the power of karma and afflictions, you are tormented by many sufferings. If you are unable to accomplish even your own aims, what need is there to mention that you cannot accomplish those of others? Since such wandering is the door to all problems, bodhisattvas must be even more disenchanted with cyclic existence than Hinayana practitio-ners and must stop their own wandering caused by karma and the afflictions. Nevertheless, bodhisattvas must enjoy being reborn in cyclic existence through their aspirational prayers and compassion. These two ways of being reborn are not the same. Failing to make this distinction leads to qualms like that above. The Bodhisattva Levels says that if the proponents of such a position have taken the vows of a bodhisattva then they have committed a"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"330 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path misdeed permeated with afflictions. However, fearing too many words, I will not quote the passage in full. . Hence, it is amazing that bodhisattvas see the defects of cyclic existence and are thoroughly disgusted, yet do not give up their vow because they are motivated by great compassion. If those who see the wonders of cyclic existence as like a celestial mansion-with-out reducing their craving even in the slightest--claim to be serv-ing others, how could their unwillingness to abandon cyclic exist-ence please the wise? As Bhavaviveka's Heart of the Middle Way says:550 Since bodhisattvas see the faults of cyclic existence, they do not remain here. Because they care for others, they do not remain in nirvaDa. In order to fulfill the needs of others, they resolve To remain in cyclic existence. Once you see the limitless sufferings of all living beings-such as the one hundred and ten sufferings explained in the Bodhisattva Levels-you allow this to be the cause for great compassion. At this time, when you cultivate a heart that has a forceful and enduring inability to withstand the sight of others' sufferings, it would be contradictory to be not even slightly disenchanted with cyclic ex-istence. [261] The theme of Aryadeva's Four Hundred Stanzas is the stages of the path upon which bodhisattvas develop great revulsion for cy-clic existence and then, seeing living beings as their close relatives, enter the ocean of cyclic existence for their sake. In his commen-tary on that work, the great master Candrakirti clarified this:551 Due to the Buddha's explanation of the faults of cyclic existence, his disciples learned to fear it and desire freedom from it. The Bhagavan said the following so that they would develop a strong connection to the Mahayana: \"0 monks, among all who have passed through cyclic existence for a long time, there is not one being among all the various types of living beings who has not been like a father, mother, son, daughter, relative, or step-relation to you.\" And further: By understanding the words of the Bhagavan, bodhisattvas are able to leap into the ocean of cyclic existence. They do this so that all beings who have been their close relatives-like father and mother-throughout beginningless time and who are now bereft and without a protector may be freed by the boat of the Mahayana."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The Attitude of a Person of Medium Capacity 331 The unsurpassed mantra vehicle also requires this method. For, as Aryadeva says in his Lamp Which Is a Compendium of Deeds:552 Through these stages, you should engage in these activities wholly free of elaborations.

What is going on in our minds?

And:"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"334 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Alas, the worldly have eyes yet are blind; Although you see the obvious, You do not think about it at all. Has your mind become hardened? Consequently, as Guhyadatta's Edifying Tale of the Seven Maidens (Sapta-kumarikavadana) states:554 We see the things of the world as wavering images of the moon in water. We see attachments as shadows of the hoods and coils of angry snakes. We see these beings to be ablaze with the flames of suffering. We therefore go to the cremation grounds, 0 King, delighting in the determination to be free. Thus, when you see that cyclic existence-environments and be-ings-is like a moon in water that is stirred by the wind-imper-manent, disintegrating, not resting even for an instant; that sensory objects-like shadows of the bodies of poisonous snakes-hold little value but great danger; and that the five types of beings are scorched by the blazing fires of the three sufferings; then you give rise to a disposition like that of northern children, a disposition that has completely turned away from attachment to cyclic existence. When this happens, there occurs the determination to be free-a longing that delights in liberation. The expression \"northern children\" is to be understood as fol-lows: in the north, roasted barley flour is scarce, and consequently the inhabitants eat small amounts of turnips. Once, there were some children there who, being hungry and wishing to eat roasted bar-ley flour, asked their mother for food. Since she had no roasted bar-ley flour, she offered them fresh turnip, which they refused. Then she offered them dried turnip, but they did not want that either, so she then gave them cooked turnip. But they turned this down as well. Finally she offered them frozen cooked turnip, whereupon they turned away with a great feeling of nausea, exclaiming, \"Ev-erything is turnips!\" [263] Likewise, with respect to whatever worldly happiness is seen, heard of, or remembered, you must, as the Kadampa (bKa' -gdams-pa) teachers have said, generate the same feeling, thinking, \"This is the world,\" \"This also is the world,\" \"Everything is suffering,\" and \"I want nothing to do with it.\" In this way, by contemplating your previous beginningless wan-derings through cyclic existence, you become disenchanted and re-volted, and by contemplating the necessity of continuing to wander"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Ascertaining the Nature of the Path Leading to Liberation 335 here indefinitely, you give rise to fear and anxiety. With a determi-nation that transcends mere words, you must, as Nagarjuna's Friendly Letter says, stop your birth in cyclic existence, the root of all harm:555 Cyclic existence is like that; birth-Whether in the lands of deities and humans, hell-beings, Hungry ghosts, or animals-is not auspicious. Understand that birth is a vessel of much harm. What is more, you must eliminate both causes of birth in cyclic existence: karma and afflictions. Still, between these two, if you have no afflictions, you will not take birth, no matter how much karma you have. Hence, you should destroy the afflictions, by cultivating a path that is complete and without error, because, once you have afflictions, even if it were possible to eradicate previously accumu-lated karma, you would immediately accumulate new karma. Ascertaining the nature of the path leading to liberation has two parts: 1. The kind of life through which you halt cyclic existence 2. The kind of path you cultivate to halt cyclic existence i) The kind of life through which you halt cyclic existence The Friendly Letter:556 To be reborn with wrong views or without a conqueror's word, Or as an animal, a hungry ghost, a hell-being, An uncultured person in a border region, A stupid and mute person, or a deity of long life Is to be afflicted by one of the eight faults that are conditions which lack leisure. After you have attained leisure, which is freedom from these rebirths, Strive to end birth. It is not possible to stop birth in cyclic existence if you have no time. Therefore, once you have obtained a life of leisure and opportu-nity, you must stop it. [264] I have already explained this. The great yogi Chang-chup-rin-chen said: Now is the time to make ourselves different from domestic animals. Also, Bo-do-wa said: For as long as we have wandered through cyclic existence in the past it has not stopped by itself. Given this, it will not stop by"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"336 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path itself now either. Hence, we must put a stop to it, and the time to do so is today, when we have obtained leisure and opportunity. For those who have attained a life of leisure and opportunity, dwelling in a household presents many obstacles to the practice of religion and has numerous shortcomings. However, the life of a renunciate, being the opposite of that, is the very best for stopping cyclic existence. The wise, therefore, should delight in such a life. Repeated reflection on the faults of householders and the virtues of renunciates will lead those who have already become renunciates to have a firm attitude, while leading those who have not yet be-come renunciates to develop good inclinations [to become renunci-ates and the like] and then act on them. I will explain how this is so. Householders, if they are wealthy, suffer in their efforts to protect that wealth, and, if poor, suffer from exhaustion brought about by seeking wealth. In this way they lead confused lives that have no pleasure, and they imagine these lives to be pleasurable. Understand that this misconception is the result of bad karma. The Garland afBirth Staries:557 Never consider as pleasurable The household, which is like a prison. Whether they are rich or poor, Those who dwell in households are greatly ailing. One undergoes afflictions by guarding wealth, While the other becomes exhausted by seeking it. Whether they are rich or poor, They have no happiness. The confusion that delights in this householder's existence Is merely the consequence of sin. Therefore, keeping many possessions and discontentedly seeking more is not the business of renunciates. If it were, they would not differ from householders. Furthermore, since living in a household is at odds with religion, it is difficult to practice religion there. The same text states:558 If you do the business of the household, [265] It is unfeasible to refrain from speaking falsely, And it is unfeasible not to punish Others who do wrong. If you practice religion, householder pursuits suffer; If you attend to the household, how can you practice religion? Religious activity is peaceful; A householder's aims are achieved through ruthlessness."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Ascertaining the Nature of the Path Leading to Liberation 337 Therefore, because of the flaw of being at odds with religion, Who, desiring to help themselves, would live in a household? And also: A household is a nest of vipers such as Arrogance, pride, and delusion. It destroys tranquillity and the bliss of happiness, And is a place of many unbearable sufferings. Who would stay in a place so similar to a snakepit? Contemplate again and again the defects of dwelling in a house-hold, and aspire to the life of a renunciate. In reference to this, re-nunciates are content with alms, simple religious robes, and alms bowls. In solitude, they remove their afflictions and aspire to be-come objects of others' veneration. As it says in Guhyadatta's Edi-fying Tale of the Seven Maidens:559 When will we thus come To shave our hair, Don clothes from the garbage And seek solitude? Gazing ahead only a yoke's length, When will we, blameless, Take in our hands earthen alms bowls, And, from household to household, partake of alms? Attached to neither material gain nor veneration, Cleaning up the bramble swamps of the afflictions, When will we become Recipients of the townspeople's donations? Renunciates are content with meager food and drink, and with clothes heavy with frost from sleeping without a roof over their heads in bedding made of grass. They aspire to sleep in their place on soft grass in front of a tree, nurtured by the happiness and joy of the teaching. As is said in the Edifying Tale of the Seven Maidens:56o When will I become unattached to my body, Rising from a pile of grass, Clothing heavy with frost, And taking only humble food and drink? [266] When will I, clothed in soft grass-Green like the parrot-Lie down in front of a tree With a banquet of the blissful things of this life?

I want nothing other than to practice in this way. Renunciates aspire to dwell in a meadow or on the bank of a river, reflecting on the similarity between their own bodies and lives and the arising and disintegration of waves. They aspire to stop, by means of discerning wisdom, the conception of self-root of cyclic existence and creator of all bad views. They aspire to overcome their obsession with the pleasures of cyclic existence, and to reflect on the animate and inanimate world as being like a magician's illu-sions. As is said in the Edifying Tale of the Seven Maidens:561 When, dwelling on a river bank or in a meadow, Will we come to see again and again That the rising and falling of waves And the world of this life are similar? When will we rid ourselves Of the view of the perishing aggregates-The mother of all bad views-And not crave the enjoyments of cyclic existence? When will we come to know That the animate and inanimate worlds Are like dreams, hallucinations, a magician's illusions, clouds, Or a city of the gandharvas? All of these persons lived as renunciates, while at the same time aspiring to these higher achievements. As Chay-ga-wa said: If there is someone living as a sage in the Valley of the Ascetics, then the father has fundamentally raised his child well. Sha-ra-wa said: When householders are very busy, you, monks, should dress nicely and visit them. They will then think, \"The life of a renunci-ate is wonderful!\" This establishes in them a latent predisposi-tion for a future life as a renunciate. Also, the Questions of Householder Ugra Siltra says562 that bod hi-sattvas who dwell in households should aspire in this way: [267] Householder bodhisattvas should think, \"When will I leave the household, an origin of suffering, and experience the life of a re-nunciate? When will I rest in the actions of the community, the action of purifying and nurturing vows, the action of lifting re-strictions, and the action of veneration?\" In this way they should delight in the thought of being a renunciate."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Ascertaining the Nature of the Path Leading to Liberation 339 This passage states that such bodhisattvas should principally as-pire to full ordination. Furthermore, the Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras says:563 The class of renunciates Has limitless virtues. Therefore, the bodhisattva who observes vows Is superior to the one who is a householder. This being the case, the life of a renunciate is praised for achieving the freedom that is liberation from cyclic existence. In addition, it is taught that it is the best life even for the accomplishment of om-niscience by way of the perfection and mantra vehicles. Further-more, among the three sets of vows, it is the vows of the renunciate that are the vows of individual liberation. Therefore, you should respect the vows of individual liberation, the root of the teaching. ii) The kind of path you cultivate to halt cyclic existence There are three parts to this explanation: 1. The certainty of the enumeration of the three trainings 2. The determination of the order of the three trainings 3. The nature of the three trainings (Chapter 24) Train in the path which is the threefold precious training. The Friendly Letter:564 Were your head or clothing suddenly to catch fire, You should still set aside extinguishing these fires And strive to eradicate birth-There is no purpose higher than this.

The training in ethical discipline makes a dis-tracted mind undistracted. [268] The training in concentration-or mental training-balances an unbalanced mind. The training in wisdom liberates an unliberated mind."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"340 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path 2' Their results The results of ethical discipline that have not degenerated are the two happy rebirths of the desire realm [either as a human or a de-ity]. The result of ethical discipline that has degenerated is rebirth in the miserable realms. The results of the training of the mind are the two happy rebirths of the higher [deities' form or formless] realms. The result of the training in wisdom is liberation. In brief, the results of the three trainings are the two goals: high status [as a human or deity] and certain goodness [of liberation or omniscience]. Since the former is twofold-happy rebirth in the higher [deities'] realms and happy rebirth in the lower [that is, desire] realm-the trainings that accomplish these are threefold. These first two cer-tainties of enumeration are mentioned in the Levels of Yogic Deeds. 3' The objects that they eliminate The former teachers asserted that, in relation to the objects they eliminate-the afflictions-the trainings are threefold, according to whether they eliminate afflictions by (1) weakening them, (2) sup-pressing their manifest forms, or (3) eradicating their seeds. b' The determination of the order of the three trainings The order of the three trainings is demonstrated in a passage from the SiiJra Requested by Brahmti (Brahma-paripTcchti-sutra) quoted in the Levels of Yogic Deeds:565 Ethical discipline is a very steady root; Concentration is the delight in a serene state of mind; In wisdom the views of noble beings and the views of sinners Are acquired and forsaken respectively. Among these, ethical discipline is the root because the other two grow out of it. Concentration, the second of the three trainings, depends on ethical discipline and takes pleasure in putting the mind into meditative equipoise. Wisdom, the third of the three trainings, depends on meditative equipoise and forsakes the view of sinners while acquiring the view of noble beings in order to see reality exactly."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"24 THE NATURE OF THE THREE TRAININGS The nature of the three trainings is as the SiUra Requested by Brahma states:566 Ethical discipline has six branches; Concentration is the four blissful abodes; The four aspects of the four noble truths Are always pure sublime wisdoms. [269] With respect to this, the training in ethical discipline has six branches: 1-2) Both (1) the possession of ethical discipline and (2) re-straint by the vows of individual liberation demonstrate the pure ethical discipline that certainly leads to liberation. 3-4) Both (3) rites and (4) possession of the range of sup-port demonstrate unimpeachable, pure ethical discipline. 5) Dread of even the smallest misdeed demonstrates pure ethical discipline that is unspoiled. 6) Correctly undertaking and training in the fundamental trainings demonstrates flawless, pure ethical discipline. \"Four abodes\" of mind refers to the four meditative stabilizations. It means the training of mind, which is \"blissful\" because the mind abides blissfully in this lifetime. The four [where the Satra Requested by Brahma reads \"The four aspects of the four\"] are the four [noble] truths. The four aspects of these four are the four aspects of each of the four truths:"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"342 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path (1) for the truth of suffering: impermanent, suffering, empty, and selfless; (2) for the truth of the origin: cause, origin, arising, and con-dition; (3) for the truth of cessation: cessation, pacification, excel-lence, and freedom; (4) for the truth of the path: path, correctness, achievement, and deliverance. The sixteen aspects-the knowledge of these sixteen aspects--con-stitute the training in wisdom. If I were explaining here the path of persons of medium capac-ity alone, I would have to give a lengthy explanation of the three trainings. However, since this is not the case, I will explain the train-ings in wisdom (insight) and in mind (meditative serenity) in the section on persons of great capacity and will not elaborate at this point. Thus, I will briefly discuss the training in ethical discipline here. In the beginning, reflect repeatedly on the benefits of ethical dis-cipline and develop enthusiasm for it from the depths of your heart. As the Great Final NirvCl1}a SLdra states:567 Ethical discipline is the ladder to all virtues. It is their foundation, just as the earth is the foundation for plants and the like. Just as a master trader goes first among all traders, so ethical discipline goes first among all virtues. [270] Like the hoisted banner of Indra, ethical discipline is the banner of all teachings. It cuts down all sins and eliminates the paths to the miserable realms. Since it cures all the illnesses of the sins, it is like a medicinal plant. Ethical dis-cipline is the stock of provisions for the terrible road of cyclic ex-istence.1t is the weapon that destroys the afflictions, the enemies. It is the spell destroying the poisonous snakes of the afflictions. It is the bridge to cross over the waters of sin. The protector Nagarjuna as well says:568 Ethical discipline-like the ground supporting the animate and inanimate worlds-Is said to be the foundation of all good qualities. And the Tantra Requested by Subahu says:569 Just as every harvest grows without fault In dependence on the earth, So too do the highest virtues depend on ethical discipline, And grow by being moistened with the water of compassion."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"The Nature of the Three Trainings 343 You should reflect on the benefits of keeping ethical discipline in accordance with the above-cited passages. There are very grave consequences for you if you undertake an ethical discipline and then fail to keep it. The Sutra Beloved of Monks (Bhik$u-prareju-sutra) says that, once you undertake a training, it will proceed in either an advantageous or disadvantageous direction:57o The ethical discipline of some leads to pleasure; The ethical discipline of others leads to pain. Those who possess ethical discipline are happy, Whereas those who break ethical discipline suffer. Therefore, you should also think about the drawbacks of not keep-ing to ethical discipline and thereby generate great respect for the training. There are four causes of an infraction: not knowing the precept, carelessness, disrespect, and various afflictions. As a remedy for not knowing the precept, listen to and understand the precepts. As a remedy for carelessness, train in attitudes such as mindfulness, which does not forget which ends to adopt and which to cast aside; vigilance, which immediately examines the three doors of body, speech, and mind and understands the right or wrong in which you are engaged; shame, which shuns faults committed with respect to oneself or the teaching; embarrassment, which shuns wrongdoing and thinks, \"Others will criticize me\"; [271] and trepidation, which fears the future karmic fruition of wrongdoing. As a remedy for dis-respect, have respect for the Teacher, his rules, and your fellow prac-titioners. As a remedy for various afflictions, examine your mind and energetically apply the remedies for whatever afflictions pre-dominate. Those who fail to make an effort in this way, who follow the rules in a lax fashion thinking that even though they have transgressed, \"it is merely a small fault,\" will gain only suffering. For, as the Ex-egesis of the Discipline says:571 Those who take lightly and slightly transgress The teaching of the compassionate Teacher Thereby come under the power of suffering-Just as one who cuts a grove of small bamboo and spoils a whole grove of mango. Here, those who transgress the king's pronouncements Would not be punished for a few such transgressions.

As the Siitra Requested by Brahma says:573 Rely upon the trainings; Undertake them earnestly, from the heart. Do not give them up later, Or break them even to save your life. Always maintain them diligently And engage in the discipline. Moreover, as the Buddha decreed in the Siitra on Having Pure Ethi-cal Discipline (Sila-sa1J1yukta-sl1tra) using reasons, you should keep your ethical discipline, even at the risk of your life:574 o monks, to lose your life and die is excellent, but to ruin and lose your ethical discipline is not. Why? Losing your life and dying expends only the life span of this rebirth, but if you ruin and lose your ethical discipline, you will experience a great downfall-separating from your lineage and giving up happiness over ten million lifetimes. [272] You should think, \"If this need to keep my ethical discipline at all costs were not the case, then shaving off my hair and donning mo-nastic robes was pointless.\" For, as the King of Concentrations Siitra says:575 After you have renounced the world and gone forth into the Buddha's teachings, You engage in sinful actions, And, attached to mounts, oxen, and chariots Have the idea that wealth and grain are essential. Why did you who make no effort to train in anything Bother to shave your heads? You who seek to escape from cyclic existence-the composite-and to reach the city of liberation will not succeed if the feet of your ethical discipline are unsteady. Not only that, you will return again to cyclic existence and be destroyed by suffering. The Buddha spoke of this, with an example, in the King of Concentrations Sl1tra:576 When a man was attacked by a gang of robbers, He tried to escape because he wished to live. But when he set out, his feet could not move or run, And so the robbers caught and subdued him."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"The Nature of the Three Trainings 345 Likewise, a confused person whose ethical discipline is im-paired, Though wanting to escape from the composite, Cannot escape because of impaired ethical discipline And is destroyed by illness, old age, and death. Therefore, as this sutra says:577 I set forth trainings For householders wearing secular clothing. At that time these monks Did not have even these trainings. The Buddha says that in these times when even monks do not com-pletely maintain the five fundamental trainings he taught to lay prac-titioners, effort in the trainings has an even greater fruit. Therefore, you should strive to maintain the trainings. The same slltra says:578 For ten million eons-as many as there are sands in the Ganges-[273] I served with a pure mind Food and drink, umbrellas, Banners, and processions of lamps to ten quadrillion buddhas. 50 much greater is the merit of whoever practices A single training night and day At a time when the sublime teaching is perishing And the 5ugata's teaching is coming to an end. Furthermore, you might think that, even were you to incur an infraction, you could confess it afterwards. However, in this case you lack an attitude of restraint that prevents you from commit-ting the action again. So engaging in this infraction is like eating poison and telling yourself that you could always take the antidote later. For, as the Lion's Roar of Maitreya Satra (Maitreya-maha-si1J1ha-niida-siUra) states:579 Maitreya, in the future, in the final five-hundred-year period of the teaching, certain renunciates and householder bodhisattvas will claim that sinful karma is completely extinguished through confessing the fault. They will disclose the infraction, saying, II After we have become involved in sin, we will confess it.\" But they will not restrain themselves from doing it again. I tell you that they possess fatal karma. What do I mean by fatal? For example, it is like people who ingest poison. They create their time of death, and then end up in a misguided descent into a miserable realm."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"346 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path And also: Maitreya, what I call poison in the noble teaching of the discipline is transgressing the fundamental trainings as I have prescribed them. Therefore, do not eat such poison. Given that maintaining vows in such a way applies to one who has taken the vows of individual liberation, it is also similar for one who practices the mantra vehicle. For, the Tantra Requested by Subahu states that even householder practitioners of mantra must act in ac-cordance with the texts on discipline, except for the matters con-cerning the marks [robes] of renunciates, the ceremonial activities, and some factors which are merely regulatory:580 Of the entire discipline that I, the Conqueror, taught-The pure ethical discipline of individual liberation-A householder practitioner of mantra should set aside The signs and rituals, and practice the rest. [274] If this is the case, then it goes without saying that renunciate practi-tioners of mantra must act in accordance with the texts on discipline. Ethical discipline is the root of practicing the mantra vehicle as well. The Tantra Requested by Subahu says:581 The root of the mantra vehicle is, in the first place, ethical discipline. From it come joyous perseverance, patience, Faith in the Conqueror, the spirit of eruightenment, The mantra vehicle, and the absence of laziness. Just as a lord possessing the seven treasures Tames all beings without disillusionment, So a mantra practitioner controls sins When possessing these seven. And, the Root Tantra of Mafijusri (Mafijusri-mula-tantra) says:582 If these persons who recite mantras spoil their ethical discipline, They would lose the highest of attainments, Also middling attainments, And the least of attainments. The Master of the Sages does not say that faulty Ethical discipline achieves the tantric path. Breaking ethical discipline is neither a situation nor a destination For those going to the city of nirval)a. For these miserable children, Where is the achievement of the tantric path?"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"The Nature of the Three Trainings 347 For beings who have faulty ethical discipline, Where are the happy realms? Since they will attain neither high status Nor the highest bliss, What need is there to speak of their attaining The knowledge of the mantra vehicle taught by the Conqueror? Kam-Iung-ba said: When a famine occurs, everything depends on barley. In the same way everything revolves around ethical discipline in the practice of the teaching. Therefore, apply yourself to this! Those who have not thought about karma and its effects will not achieve pure ethical discipline. Therefore thinking about this is a personal imperative. And Sha-ra-wa said: In general, whatever good or ill happens to you depends on reli-gion. Moreover, within religion, if you depend on what the texts on discipline say, you will not even have to repeat things; you will be confidently pure, consistent, sure, and steadfast. [275] Geshe Drom-d6n-ba said: One group holds that when you rely upon the discipline, you discard the practice of mantra and that when you rely upon the mantra vehicle, you discard the rules of the discipline. The teach-ing that the discipline is the companion of the mantra vehicle and the mantra vehicle is the companion of the discipline exists only in my guru Atisha's lineage. Also, the Elder said: When things of great import or unexpected events befell us Indi-ans, those who upheld the scriptural collections would assemble and determine whether these things were proscribed in the three scriptural collections or were at odds with them. Based on this, we made decisions. In addition to that, those of us from Vikra-malasila were concerned that there be no proscription among the bodhisattvas' activities and no contradiction with them. Nonethe-less, those who upheld the texts on discipline made the final de-terminations. Further, with regard to keeping a pure ethical discipline in this way, Neu-sur-ba said: Right now, only this internal struggle with the afflictions is impor-tant. If you do not struggle with the afflictions, you will not achieve a pure ethical discipline, in which case, you will not attain the"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"348 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path concentration and wisdom that, respectively, suppress and up-root the afflictions. Hence, as the Buddha says, you will have to wander continually through cyclic existence. Therefore, as I ex-plained before, once you have identified the afflictions, reflected on their faults and on the benefits of separating from them, and planted the spies of mindfulness and vigilance, you must repeat-edly fend off whatever affliction raises its head. Further, you must see any affliction as an enemy and attack it as soon as it arises in your mind. Otherwise, if you acquiesce when it first appears, and then nurture it with improper thoughts, you will have no way to defeat it, and it will conquer you in the end. Even if you fail to arrest the afflictions through such efforts, you must not allow them to linger, but must immediately disperse them, as though they were drawings in water. Do not let them be like drawings in stone. But with regard to religious matters, you should do the opposite, as Nagarjuna's Friendly Letter says:583 [276] Know that the mind can be like a drawing Made in water, in earth, or in stone. When afflictions arise, it is best to have the first, But when aspiring to religion, the last is best. This is said in Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds as well:584 We should be obsessed with these afflictions. Resenting them, we do battle While making an exception for only those afflictions That are destroyers of other afflictions. Better that I be burnt or killed, Or that my head be cut off, Than that I should ever bow Before my enemies, the afflictions. Also, Geshe Pu-chung-wa said, \"Even when I am buried under the afflictions, I can still clench my teeth beneath them.\" Upon hearing what Pu-chung-wa said, Bo-do-wa stated, \"If you do this, you will instantly stop them.\" When you rout ordinary enemies, they can take over another country, seize power, and then return again to challenge you. The afflictions are not like this. Once you expel them completely from your mind, there is no other country to which they can retreat; nor can they return. However, we fail to overcome the afflictions be-cause we lack joyous perseverance. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:585"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"The Nature of the Three Trainings 349 Ordinary enemies, expelled from a country, Settle in other countries and take them over; Recouping their strength, they then return. The afflictions are enemies of a different sort. The eye of wisdom eradicates the various afflictions. Once cleared from my mind, where can they go? From where can they regroup and counterattack? Of weak mind, I have no joyous perseverance at all. Nyuk-rum-ba (bsNyug-rum-pa) said: When an affliction appears, do not be indolent, but counter it immediately with its remedy. If you cannot overcome it, stop thinking about it, set up a maI:u;iala and other offerings, offer these to the guru and the chosen deities, and make supplications to them to overcome it. Focusing on the affliction, recite the mantras of wrathful deities. Doing these things will cause the affliction to disappear. [277J Lang-ri-tang-ba (Glang-ri-thang-pa) said: Even changing the place where you sit or merely turning your head will make the afflictions disappear. It is said that he struggled with his afflictions. Such disappearance of the afflictions as Lang-ri-tang-ba describes occurs when you do as Gon-ba-wa said: \"What is there to do ex-cept to stand guard over your mind day and night?\" Furthermore, no matter how many times the Great Elder met someone in a day, he would always ask, \"Meanwhile, have you had a good mind?\" The way to eliminate the afflictions is as follows, beginning with the six root afflictions. Among the great misdeeds, ignorance is the most tenacious, and serves as the basis of all other afflictions. There-fore, as a remedy for ignorance, you should meditate a great deal on dependent-arising and become knowledgeable about the pro-gression and cessation of cyclic existence. If you have habitually cultivated this, none of the bad views such as the five afflicted views will occur. Hostility is the enemy who brings suffering both in this and in future lives, and who destroys the accumulated roots of virtue. As Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says, \"There is no sin like hatred.\"586 Therefore, never give hostility an opportunity, and make every ef-fort to be patient. If hostility does not arise, you will be very happy, even in this lifetime. Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds:587"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"350 The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Those who persistently defeat anger, Will be happy in this and other lives. Attachment-that is, craving-strengthens all previously accu-mulated virtues and nonvirtues and enhances their power to cre-ate cyclic existence. For those in the desire realm, craving arises from the feelings caused by the mental process of contact, which involves sensory objects. Therefore, you should meditate a great deal on what is externally or internally unpleasant and on the faults of being at-tached to desirable objects, and thereby overcome your craving and attachment. The great master Vasubandhu says: The five beings-deer, elephants, butterflies, Fish, and bees-are overcome by five desirable objects. [278] If a single desirable object can overwhelm each one of them, why shouldn't All five destroy someone who constantly dwells on them? Moreover, the four cravings for gain, fame, praise, and pleasure and the dislike for their four opposites are quick to occur and difficult to get rid of. Strive to remedy this, and stop these eight worldly concerns by meditating on the faults of cyclic existence in general and by cultivating the mindfulness of death in particular. Eliminate pride, as it is the chief obstacle to the development of the path in this lifetime and causes future rebirth as a servant and so forth. The way to do this is stated in the Friendly Letter:588 If you reflect again and again, \"Just as I have not transcended Illness, aging, death, and loss of the pleasant, So my karma and its results are my own doing,\" You will overcome arrogance because you will be applying its remedy. Once you have achieved certainty about the truths, the three jew-els, and karma and its effects, the affliction of doubt will not arise. The secondary afflictions-those called sleep, lethargy, excite-ment, laziness, carelessness, shamelessness, lack of embarrassment, forgetfulness, and lack of vigilance-are quick to occur and hinder your cultivation of the virtuous group of phenomena. You should understand their faults and get used to reducing their strength through an immediate application of their remedies. With respect to their faults the Friendly Letter says:589 Excitement and regret, malice, lethargy And sleep, longing for the desirable, and doubt-"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"The Nature of the Three Trainings 351 Understand that these five obscurations Are robbers who steal the riches of virtue. Also, the Exhortation to Wholehearted Resolve discusses the faults at length:590 Phlegm, wind, and bile Occur to a great extent in the bodies Of those who take pleasure in sleep and lethargy; Their constituents are in disorder. [279] For those who take pleasure in lethargy and sleep Their stomachs are unclean because of poor food, Their bodies are heavy and their complexions unhealthy, Even their words are unclear. And:591 Those who take pleasure in lethargy and sleep Are confused and their aspirations toward religion fade. These children lose all of their good qualities, Their virtues degenerate, and they fall into darkness. The Mindfulness of the Excellent Teaching says:592 The one foundation of all the afflictions Is laziness. Those who have it, Those who have a single moment of laziness, Will have no practice at all. The Collection of Indicative Verses says:593 Those involved in carelessness Are childish people who ruin their minds. As master traders guard their wealth, So should the wise take care. The Garland of Birth Stories says:594 o Prince of the Deities, rather than cast aside your shame And act at odds with the teaching in your mind, You would do better to take up an earthen vessel, put on poor clothing, And be seen arriving at the home of an enemy.

Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds says:596 Even the faithful, the learned, And those who undertake joyous perseverance Will be polluted by infractions Through the fault of a lack of vigilance. Thus, even if you cannot arrest the afflictions or the secondary afflictions, it is indispensable to see them as enemies right now, without strengthening them or taking their side. Hence, side with the remedies and strive to overcome the afflictions. After you have accomplished this, completely purify whatever ethical discipline you have assumed. As the glorious Gon-ba-wa, disciple of the Great Elder, said to Neu-sur-ba [280]: Ye-shay-bar (Ye-[shes]-'bar), if, tomorrow or the next day, some-one were to ask all your disciples, \"What are you practicing as the core of your personal instructions?\" they would answer that it was to attain superknowledges or a vision of their chosen de-ity. However, they should answer, \"It is becoming more and more definite about the causes and effects of karma and, consequently, keeping purely whatever vows I have assumed.\" Therefore, you should understand this to indicate that the phrase \"attainments which result from meditation\" refers to the achieve-ment of a reduction in afflictions such as ignorance. When people fight with others-something that yields only sins and suffering both in this and in other lives-they endure all man-ner of suffering for however long it takes, even at the cost of their lives. Then they show off the scars of their wounds, etc., and boast, \"I received this one at that time.\" This being the case, it is even more appropriate for us to endure the hardships undergone while per-severing joyously in destroying the afflictions. Engaging in the Bodhi-sattva Deeds:597 Since even a scar inflicted by an enemy for no reason Is worn as if it were a decoration for the body, Why should suffering bother me, When I truly strive to accomplish a great purpose?

In the following, dates for persons and texts have been indicated according to the conventional conversion of years given in our sources in terms of a Tibetan sexagenary or duodenary cycle. Exact dating will of course depend on extensive research in Ti-betan historical and biographical literature, and it may lead to corrections of one year at least in terms of the Gregorian calendar. In several cases no reliable information for dating has been available. As for the Tibetan sources and the translations and studies in European languages cited in this introduction, they do not of course represent a complete bibliography of the lam rim literature. 2. The name dGa' / dGe-Idan-pa is connected with the name of the chief monastery of this religious order and philosophical school, 'Brog-ri-bo dGa' / dGe-Idan-mam-par-rgyal-ba'i-gling, founded near Lhasa by Tsong-kha-pa himself. This school's more familar name is dGe-Iugs-pa, said to be a euphonic variant of dGa' -Iugs-pa by Thu'u-bkvan Blo-bzang-Chos-kyi-nyi-ma at the beginning of his history of this school in the Grub mtha' shel gyi me long (pp. 235-36 of the Kansu reprint of 1984). Being a continua-tion of the earlier bKa' -gdams school going back to Atisha in the eleventh century, this school is also known as the bKa' -gdams-gsar-ma. On the life of Tsong-kha-pa, in addition to E. Obermiller's still useful article \"Tsoit-kha-pa Ie pandit\" in Melanges chinois et bouddhiques 3 (1935), pp. 319-38, see R. Thurman (ed.), The Life and Teachings of Tsang Khapa (Dharamsala, 1982) and R.

'Jam-dbyangs-bzhad-pa (mChan: 18.5-6) explains that the Bodhi-patha-pradipa is the root text for Tsong-kha-pa's text, and since Atisha is the author of that, implicitly he can be considered the author of this text.

When a brahmin is declining in fortune, it is all right to steal, because everything is Brahma's creation, and the brahmins own those creations.
