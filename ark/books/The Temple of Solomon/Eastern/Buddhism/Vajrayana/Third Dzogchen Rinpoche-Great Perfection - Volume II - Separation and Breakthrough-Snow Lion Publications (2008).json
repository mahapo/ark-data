There are, however, many ways to arrive at this point of fruition. What, then, is the difference between them? Which path is the highest and best? The difference between the various paths lies in the methods they utilize, how long the journey takes, and how difficult it is. From one point of view, the most profound path is simply the one that works best, the one that makes the greatest impact on our minds. Generally speaking, however, it is · in the Great Perfection that we find the pinnacle of all the Buddha's teach-ings. These profound instructions, known as Atiyoga or Dzogchen, bring the practitioner swifi:ly and effortlessly to liberation, to the realization of primordial buddhahood_ To access the incomparable path of the Great Perfection, we begin our journey with· the process of empowerment. The most important empow-erment in this tradition is called the empowerment o/ awareness, in which one is empowered into the display or expression of rigpa-the play ofbasic awareness. This empowerment must be received without effort. Whenever we think, \"I want to get it right!\" that very effort becomes an obstruction. When we relax flaturally, however, when we are totally open to inconceiv-able dimensions of experience, we have a genuine opportunity to receive the blessings of the lineage and recognize the reality that is being pointed out to us. The Great Perfection must be entered with a sense of total openness and genuine devotion: devotion to the primordial state ofbuddhahood; devo-tion to the inconceivable truth; devotion to our own awakened heart; and devotion to the instructions and lineage masters who show us this real-ity and symbolize its realization. Our masters and the instructions they give us can be likened to a mirror. What is reflected back to us is our own"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"· xii / GREAT PERFECTION face, the true nature of mind. Devotion is like light that illuminates the space around us so we can see this reflection. What we see in this mirror, however, is not something outside of us-it is our own genuine heart of enlightenment. THE THREE CLASSES OF THE GREAT PERFECTION --There are three categories of instructions within the Great Perfection: the Outer Mirld Class, the Inner Space Class, and the Secret Key Instruction Class. These three classes are progressive stages of meditation through which we may realize absolute reality. The breakthrough of original purity and the direct leap of spontaneous presence, two stages that are often regarded as the main practices ofDzogchen, are found in the Key Instruc-tion Class. The teachings found in this book pertain primarily to the first of these practices, the breakthrough of original purity. MIND CLASS Accprding to the view of the Mind Class, all phenomena of samsara and nirvana, all appearances, are the display or creative energy of the true nature of mind. Everything arises from this nature and everything dis-solves back into it. For this reason, it is said that we should see all phe-nomena as dreamlike. We normally fixate on subject and object as being solid and real, clinging to the idea that they truly exist. This constitutes our basic experience of duality. . To transcend this fixation, we train in the Mind Class. In this train-ing, we view appearances, in all their variety, as the play of the mind, like images reflected in a mirror. We see that they do not have any true or gen-uine existence of their own, that they are all simply the wondrous display of the mind itsel£ The impure appearances of samsara are the deluded appearances of our own minds, just as the pure appearances of nirvana are the undeluded appearances of the mind. This is the basic idea of the Mind Class: we must break through our conceptual clinging to the true existence of samsara and nirvana, to the duality of subject and object. Since all appearances are the play of self-occurring, spontaneously existing wisdom, in truth there is no duality"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":".FOREWORD I xili to overcome; there is no \"bad\" samsara and no \"good\" nirvana that truly exist. All appearances are, therefore, perfecdy complete and abide in a great expanse free from all extremes. The Mind Class shows us that things do not exist in any ~rue, ultimate sense. They appear, yet are empty at the same time; they are appearance-emptiness. When we gain certainty in this view, we are freed from the idea that there is something to be abandoned. We usually think that in order to achieve enlightenment, to get to the state of freedom, we must abandon samsara. This is transformed through the view and practice of the Mind Class. Because appearances are the expression of mind, and mind's nature is original wisdom, meditation in the Mind Class consists of resting natu-rally in appearance-emptiness, the dharmakaya. SPACE CLASS While the Mind Class emphasizes clarity, the apparent aspect of phenom-ena, the Space Class emphasizes emptiness, self-liberation, and purity. Whatever manifests as the play of mind's true nature is primordially free and naturally pure. Therefore, regardless of how it may appear, it is already liberated; its appearance and liberation are simultaneous. More-over, whatever appears does not waver from the expanse of the true nature of mind. If we become attached to the view of the Mind Class, the great expanse free from all extremes, in which there is nothing to be abandoned, we need to train in the view and practice of the Space Class. To transcend any subtle clinging to the nondual state, the view of the Space Class teaches that there has never been any existence or nonexistence. The nature of all phenomena is primordial freedom, and it has been right from the beginning. This great space of original wisdom, personified as the female buddha Samantabhadri, is the vast expanse of awareness, or rigpa, from which all appearances manifest. At this point, appearances are not even seen as the play or energy of the mind. From the viewpoint of the expanse, they have no true existence from the very moment they appear. Appearances are pri-mordially liberated-free from all concepts of existence, nonexistence, both, and neither. The word \"space; here, is an experiential term. It means more than our ordinary concept of space. In this context, it has the sense ofbeing in the midst of space, rather than simply observing it. In other words, it is being"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv I GREAT PERFECTION immersed in space; experiencing the quality of space without concepts or any particular point of view. It also conveys a sense of union, meaning the union of space and awareness that we experience fully, without any subject-object duality. In the Mind Class, we uncover our clinging to dualistic existence, and then apply the view of nonexistence, or nonduality, as the antidote to that clinging. We adopt the view that everything is in the great expanse of free-dom from all. extremes. We may, however, become attached to the view that appearances do not truly exist, as taught in the Mind Class. To go fur-ther, we then utilize the instructions of the Space Class to understand that there is not and never has been any such thing as nonexistence either. The fact that this view is used as an antidote does not alter the true nature of reality; it does not make any difference. Why? Because this very effort is based on another form of confusion. This is like being bitten by a poisonous snake in a dream. If you don't know you're dreaming, you may race to a hospital for an antidote to the poison, then take it and recover. Nevertheless, there never was a snake, nor a snake bite; it was all just a dream. You were never in that situation to begin with, so why would you need an antidote? Even the antidote in the dream never existed. In the same way, all our efforts to remedy clinging to existence are like make-believe from the point of view of absolute reality. We are still con-fused when we think an antidote is necessary, when we believe it will change us in some way. In other words, we are not awake yet . . When meditating on the Space Class, there is nothing to do. We just rest and relax freely, without trying to alter the phenomena that are danc-ing in front of our senses. KEY INSTRUCTION CLASS In the first two classes, we looked at the nature of mind and phenomena from two perspectives: from the angle of appearance and from the angle of emptiness. Said differently, in the Mind Class, radiant, luminous wisdom is emphasized, whlle in the Space Class the focal point is the vast expanse of reality itsel£ In reality, however, the nature of mind goes beyond both. The view of the Secret Key Instruction Class shows the true nature of mind to be the perfect union of appearance and emptiness. In the Key Instruction Section, the true nature of mind is introduced directly. There are two main classifications of practice in this class: the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FOREWORD I XV breakthrough of original purity and the direct leap into spontaneous pres-ence. In the breakthrough stage, every form of conceptual fixation is cut through right on the spot. This approach is geared towards lazy individu-als, who can use this path to gain liberation effortlessly. The direct leap enhances the realization achieved in the breakthrough stage. This practice is taught for diligent individuals to gain liberation through effort. These three classes are traditionally likened to the body, heart, and blood: the Outer Mind Class is likened to the body, the Inner ~pace Class to the heart, and the Secret Key Instructions to the heart's very essence-the life-force or blood that runs through it. When the word \"secret\" is used · in referen~e to the Key Instruction Class, it is referring to what is most essential; to what is, in some sense, hidden from us. Although we don't see the blood in our heart, without it our bo4y would not function. Our body, in contrast, we see all the time, whlle our heart and the blood flow-ing through it are increasingly hidden from view. In the same way, the ordinary, external appearances of the world are what is most accessible to us and what we are primarlly conscious o£ That is why the Mind Class, which deals with appearances, is called the \"outer\" section. The Space Class, on the other hand, works with mind's internal phenomena-perceptions, thoughts, and ~otions-which are less visi-. ble. Therefore, these teachings are regarded as \"inner.\" Finally, what is most hidden, and most needed, are the kq instructions. These are called \"secret\" because they are so profound, they can only be pointed out directly. They are also called \"pith\" instructions, as they can destroy a great amount of confusion with just a few words. These key instructions convey the essen-tial points of practice, thereby enabling us to realize the nature of our own mind-inseparable awareness-emptiness. They reveal what is hidden by pointing out this nature directly, so that we can see it for oursdves .. With the K'ey lnstructioa Class, there is a sense of fruition, a sense of reaching the point of naked truth. Like shooting an arrow and hitting the bull's-eye, at this stage we are no longer just preparing to shoot, nor are we hitting the outer rim of the target. Our arrow has struck its mark. Here we arrive directly at the essential point, the vajra spot where there is no need for further investigation or discursive analysis. · These instructions are said to be superior, and perhaps more direct, than those in the previous two classes. The reason for this is that the Mind and Space Classes still involve some degree of conceptual analysis and fixa-tion regarding appearance and emptiness. In contrast, the Key Instruction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvi I GREAT PERFECTION Class goes beyond concept altogether-there is simply the self-expression of the way things truly are. Ihe V'JeW of the Key Instruction Class In the Key Instruction Class, the view of original wisdom involves three stages and three corresponding pointing out instructions: 1) pointing out the wisdom of the originally pure essence, 2.) pointing out the wisdom of the spontaneously present nature, and 3) pointing out the wisdom of their inseparable union. The Originally Pure Essence The first pointing out instruction explains that the essence of mind is origi-nally pure wisdom. 14e mind's fundamental state is primordially pure; it has-been this way from the very beginning. In this very moment, the mind is completely pure in essence, yet this originally pure essence is not real or truly existent. It is primordially empty. This essence cannot be seen by conceptual mind. Nevertheless, while it cannot be observed in a dualistic manner, there is a seeing that is free of duality. Furthermore, this originally pure essence cannot be fully expressed in words, illustrated with examples, or understood by thoughts. It cannot be conceived of by the dualistic mind. As it is naturally empty, its empti-ness does not have to be created by the conceptual mind. Nothing called \"samsara\" or \"nirvana\" can be found apart from the movements of conceptual, dualistic mind. Each of these is imputed in rela-tion to the other. It follows, then, that samsara is not something that needs to be abandoned, nor is nirvana something to hope for or adopt. In this way, one lets go of the idea that there are real things to be relinquished or adopted. The Spontaneously Present Nature The second pointing out instruction teaches spontaneous presence, show-ing how the nature of mind is self-manifest, self-occurring awareness. While the essence of mind is empty, that emptiness is not a vacuous state. It has a vivid, luminous, and dear quality. That is spontaneously present wisdom. This wisdom is inherently present within the nature of mind; it has been from the very beginning. It is present at all times, even when we think it is absent. The intensity of this luminosity can be so strong that it has a blinding effect, like looking directly into the sun. When we can't see it, it"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FOREWORD I xvii is not because there is no light, but because it is too bright. This is similar to the experiences of deep sleep and death, when we lose consciousness or fed as though we are falling into darkness. Actually, these experiences are taught to be times when we are resting in mind's luminosit:y. or dense clar-ity, though we may not recognize what is happening. Spontaneously present wisdom has an expressive energy that is unceas-ing and all pervasive. Its energy radiates in all directions; like the sun's rays filling the entire sky with light, this luminous wisdom pervades all of sam-sara and nirvana, abiding inseparably with all phenomena. It is the life force of everything. If we recognize this pure, luminous nature of mind, then we have a direct experience of self-manifest, self-aware wisdom. In this experience there is no samsara and no nirvana. If we do not recognize it, however, we have a direct experience of confused appearances. Inseparability The third pointing out instruction shows the true nature of mind to be the inseparable union of luminosity and emptiness, or awareness and empti-ness. The wisdom of original purity and the luminous nature of mind are inseparable, just like a candle flame and its light. The candle flame's light cannot be separated from the flame itself. just as the candle flame cannot be separated from its light. These two are not different, yet neither are they the same. In the same way, the mind's originally pure essence and sponta-neously present nature are neither the same, nor different. These two quali-ties transcend being identifiable as either single or multiple. They are in a state of primordial union. Emptiness and awareness are always experienced together. If we con-template emptiness and enter into that experience as much as possible, there will still be an aspect of clarity or luminosity in our contemplation. Similarly, no matter how deeply we meditate on luminosity, the essence of that experience will be beyond identification and devoid of inherent existence. The true nature of mind is unconditioned and uncompounded. Primor-dially and spontaneously present, this nature cannot be seen convention-ally or perceived by the dualistic mind. How, then, can we understand it? How can we know it? This view cannot be understood based on some-one else's explanations; it can only be known through direct experience. In other words, it is through putting it into practice and experiencing it for ourselves that we can come to understand the mind's true nature."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":":xviii I GREAT PERFECTION The nature of mind that is determined by the profound pointing out instructions of the Key Instruction Class is none other than this very mind of the present moment. If you look anywhere else, you will not find it. It is the empty appearance of this very moment, the thought of this very moment, the mental afflictions of this very moment, the direct percep-tion of this moment. The mind changes continually, so we must look at its nature again and again. When we can rest directly in the present moment of mind, with full confidence that liberation is present within whatever arises, we will come to recognize the complete and perfect reality of our own essence. The Breakthrough and Direct Leap The Key Instruction Class itself contains various divisions, the most pro-found of which is the Nyingtik, or Heart Essence, of the Great Perfection. In the Heart Essence, the first stage of practice is called the breakthrough of original purity, or kadak trekchii. Kadak is original purity, meaning the primordially pure nature of awareness. Breakthrough refers to the ·process of resolving the nature of emptiness by breaking past or cutting through all levels of conceptuality, even the experiences of meditation. The second stage of practice is called the direct leap into spontaneous presence, or lhundrup tiigaL This term conveys the sense ofleaping straight into the immediate experience of original wisdom. Here, the quality of vivid clarity is emphasized, the spontaneously present, luminous nature of mind. This phase is likened to crossing over a mountain pass directly, rather than climbing in a more methodic, step-by-step manner. The practice of breakthrough is essential when it comes to realizing the originally pure nature of mind and phenomena. This nature is empti-ness, the basic state of the Great Perfection. For this reason, a thorough grounding in the view of Madhyamaka can be a great help when receiv-ing the instructions on breakthrough. With the correct view of emptiness, one can meditate effectively on original purity. When supported by the Madhyamaka view and the instructions of breakthrough, the stage of the direct leap becomes very powerful and fruitful. On the other hand, if the practitioner has not thoroughly trained in breakthrough and completed this practice properly, the meditations of the direct leap will be difficult to access. The practices ofbreakthrough and direct leap go hand in hand. The prac-tice of breakthrough emphasizes the view and emptiness, while the direct"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FOREWORD / xix leap focuses more on meditation and luminosity. Together, these two form a complete practice. Breakthrough, furthermore, must precede the direct leap. There is a saying in Tibet that if one doesn't breakthrough first, one won't be able to leap directly into anything. For this reason, breakthrough is very important, especially at the beginning. These main ·practices contain many stages, meditations, and instruc:. tions. To progress through all of these steps in the correct sequence we must rely on the instructions of our own guru. Practicing each individual step takes a great deal of time and there are various pointing out instruc-tions given at each phase. To benefit from the teachings, the pointing out instructions need to penetrate our minds. For this reason, simply hearing a cursory explanation of the teachings. is not enough. --THE EXCELLENT CHARIOT --This book contains the second half of Dzogchen Ngeton Tenzin Zang-po's The Excellent Chariot, which issues from the unbroken lineage of the Great Perfection. As one· of the most beautiful and lucid explana-tions of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, the Khandro Nyingtik, it pro-vides invaluable guidance for practitioners of the Dzogchen teachings. Its instructions are at once both profound and accessible. For centuries, The Excellent Chariot has served as one of the main instruction manuals used at Dzogchen Monastery in eastern Tibet. Heart Essence practice begins with the outer and inner preliminary practices. These meditations are taught extensively in the first half of The Excellent Chariot, which is contained in Great Perfection: Outer and Inner Preliminaries. Next are the unique Heart Essence preliminary practices; the outer and inner separation, the preliminaries of the three gates, resting naturally, and revitalization. Together, these outer, inner, and unique pre-liminary practice~ comprise the first stage of Heart Essence practice. This volume contains detailed instructions on the last of these three stages-the unique Heart Essence preliminary practices. The second stage consists of the main Heart Essence practices: break-through and direct leap. Of these two, The Excellent Chariot focuses on the breakthrough stage.

The first half of this manual, published as Great Per-fiction: Outer and Inner Preliminaries, provides background teachings on the Heart Essence lineage, as well as detailed instructions on the prepa-ratory practices of the Great Perfection. l}uilding on these foundational teachings, this volume presents detailed instructions on the unique prelim-inaries and breakthrough meditation of the Nyingtik, or Heart Essence, of the Great Perfection. In the Nyingma School, the spiritual journey is framed as a progression through nine spiritual approaches, which are ofi:en referred to as \"vehicles• or \"yanas.\"The first three-the Listener Vehicle, Solitary Buddha Vehicle, and Bodhisattva Vehicle~are collectively referred to as the \"Sutra Vehi-cle.• In these approaches, one trains successively in the basic principles of renunciation, interdependence, bodhichitta, and emptiness; . The next six vehicles comprise. the \"Tantra Vehicle; or \"Vajrayana; in which a series of increasingly subde methods are used to speed up the pro-cess of spiritual transformation. First are the Three Outer Tantras-Kriya, Charya, and Yoga. In Kriya Tantra, acts of ritual purification and physical austerity are emph~ized, while in Charya Tantra ascetic practices are used in tandem with methods designed to bring about a state.of meditative con-centration. In Yoga T antra, these acts of asceticism are dropped altogether; the emphasis is solely on the internal process of meditative absorption. The final three vehicles-Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga-are known as the Three Inner Tantras. The hallmark of these vehicles is their use of the various development and completion stage yogas. All three of these vehicles utilize these yogas to some degree, yet they vary in terms of emphasis. Mahayoga focuses on the development stage, whereas Anuyoga and Atiyoga both emphasize the completion stage. In Anuyoga, however,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"2. / GREAT PERFECTION the subde body practices of the symbolic completion stage take prece-dence, while in Atiyoga formless completion stage practices receive the most attention. Atiyoga-the final stage of the nine-vehicle journey-is synonymous with the Great Perfection . . The Great Perfection contains many divisions and approaches. Of these, the Heart Essence teachings present the most profound and direct path to spiritual awakening. In contrast to the elaborate philosophies of the sutra tradition, and even the complex development and completion stage prac-tices found in other forms of Buddhist tantra, this approach is grounded in the understanding that the enlightened state is directly accessible each and every moment. Liberation, in other words, is not a goal to attain, but rather an immanent reality that must be recognized. In the Great Perfec-tion there is no need to strive towards some future objective. Enlighten-ment is here and now. The following passage from The Precious Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle summarizes this approach: According to the key instructions of the Great Perfection, when it comes to self-occurring wisdom there is no samsara and no nirvana. Hence, wisdom is inherently free; it is beyond being something to embrace or reject. While this Great Perfection does not exist as any thing whatsoever, it is unimpeded as the wisdom of universal freedom. It is at once both originally pure of faults and spontaneously present in terms of its enlightened qualities. This is the ground that one must realize. Once one has come to a decisive understanding of this ground, one medi-tates on self-occurring wisdom by viewing whatever manifests as the play of reality itsel£ Meditation, here, does not involve the slightest sense of deliberate concentration. Instead, meditating on this sublime and uninhibited self-liberation is a nonmedita-tion, the natural manifestation of the flow of wisdom.1 As Longchenpa points out here, there are two main principles in this sys-tem. The first is that our own awareness is already pure and pristine, and that it always has been. This fundamental state is termed original purity. The only difference between buddhas and ordinary beings is that the for-mer recognize this innate purity, while the latter do not. This pure nature of min~ is not a void or blank state, but luminous and filled with the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION I 3 entire range of enlightened qualities. The mind's luminous nature, more-over, spontaneously manifests to the realized practitioner. This spontane-ous presence is the second main principle of the Great Perfection. The principles of original purity and spontaneous presence are actu-alized through the practices of trekchO and toga/, respectively, the break-through and direct leap. Together, these two form the core of Heart Essence practice. Longchenpa explains: In breakthrough, one brings naked awareness into one's own experience. On this effortless path, one need not utilize appear-ances, for liberation occurs all on its own. This buddhahood without meditation is geared for lazy individuals, its vital points intended for those of the highest caliber. The direct leap, on the other hand, is for those who are more industrious. In this approach, liberation requires effort and one must utilize the appearances of luminosity to purify the. corporeal body into a body of light, thereby bringing the attainment ofbuddhahood in this very life. 2 With the view ofbreakthrough, the guru introduces the student directly to the mind's fundamental nature of original purity. This pure essence does not need to be changed or altered in any way. The practitioner need not strive to purify obscurations, nor work at gathering the two accumulations. On the contrary, such purposeful effort is taught to be a major obstacle on the path of the natural Great Perfection. The only thing to do here, if one can be said to do anything, is simply recognize and sustain the flow of pure awareness. For students of the highest caliber, recognition and realization occur simultaneously. In the Illuminating Lamp of the Copper L(!ttered, Vimalamitra writes: Breakthrough carries the meaning of immediacy, indicating that liberation requires no effort and occurs all on its own.' For those who are not of capable of mastering the breakthrough view instantaneously, the meditations of the direct leap may be utilized to speed up the process of realization. In this approach, one uses physical postures and gazes to directly experience the manifestations of reality itsel£ While this stage does involve working actively with appearance, the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"4 I GREAT PERFECTION approach here differs significantly from the development and completion stages found in other forms of Buddhist tantra. In the direct leap, medita-tion is imbued with the breakthrough view. Thus, there are no fabricated visualizations to develop {as is the case in the development stage), nor is there any need to work at bringing the subtle energies into the cen-tral channel {as in the symbolic completion stage). For this reason, the practitioner must already have a stable recognition of the nature of mind for the direct leap to be effective. If one is thoroughly grounded in the breakthrough view, the meditations of the direct leap provide a powerful and swift method to bring one's experience of pure awareness to its full-est expression. --GREAT PERFECTION IN INDIA AND TIBET--In light of their great power and profundity, the teachings of the Great Perfection have been safeguarded and practiced in secret for ages. In the human realm, the Great Perfection was first practiced in the charnel grounds of India, and later amidst the snowy peaks and barren plains of Tibet.4 The texts of the Great Perfection abound in tales of the siddhas and saints who mastered these teachings, many of which are recounted in the translation of The Excellent Chariot that follows. The Great Perfection is not a static body of teachings, but a fluid tradi-tion that has grown and evolved over time. The literary tradition of the Great Perfection began with Garap Dorje. This master was the first person to c~mmit the 6,4-oo,ooo v~rses of the Great Perfection to writing. Garap Dorje's student, Manjushrimitra, divided these teachings into the Mind, Space, and Key Instruction Classes. Shri Simha, Manjushrimitra's heart son, then further divided the Key Instruction Class into the Outer, Inner, Secret, and Extremely Secret Unsurpassed Cycles.5 This last division, the Extremely Secret Unsurpassed Cycle of the Key Instruction Class, is more commonly referred to as Nyingtik, the \"Heart Essence\" of the Great Per-fection. It is this profound set of teachings that concerns us here. In its early history, the Heart Essence teachings were practiced and taught by a lineage of remarkable masters. The precise details of the lin-eage succession vary depending on the source, yet in most accounts anum-ber of important figures emerge. The following passage from Clarifying the Practice of the Heart Essence gives a general overview of the Great Per-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 5 fection lineage, starting with the primordial buddhas Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri, and then descending through a series of Indian, Chinese, and Tibetan siddhas: Glorious Samantabhadra and his female counterpart taught the male and female buddhas of the five sambhogakaya fami-lies, as well as the sixth buddha, the great Vajradhara. Vajra-dhara taught the glorious teacher Vajrasattva, who went on to teach the nirmanakaya buddha Garap Dorje. This master then taught the vidyadhara of enlightened form, Manjushrimitra, who transmitted the teachings to the vidyadhara of enlightened mind, Shri Simha. Shri Simha taught them to the great vidya-dhara Padmakara, the wise Vimalamitra, and the translator Vai-rochana. These three masters passed the teachings on to King Trisong Deutsen, the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal, Nanam Dorje Dud-jom, and other great treasure revealers and vidyadharas.6 Though the individuals listed here figure prominently in most of the Great Perfection's lineage histories, it is important to note that each indi-vidual cycle of teachings offers its own distinct presentation. In The Excel-lent Chariot, for example, Garap Dorje is said to have transmitted the teachings directly to Shri Simha, who then passed them on to Padmasam-bhava. This is the presentation of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis. The Heart Essence ofVimalamitra, by contrast, states that Garap Dorje passed on the teachings to Manjushrimitra, and the lineage then descended to Shri Simha,Jnanasutra, and finally to Vimalamitra. These two lineages will be discussed in more detail below. Three masters brought the Heart Essence teachings to Tibet: the Indian saints Padmasamb.liava and Vimalamitra, and the Tibetan translator Vairo-chana. Vairochana's teachings pertain primarily, though not entirely, to the Mind and Space Classes mentioned above.7 These teachings have largely lost currency due to the prevalence of the revelatory \"treasure\" teachings ofPadmasambhava, which discuss the Great Perfection almost exclusively in terms of the Heart Essence teachings.8 Of these three lineages, the teachings of Padmasambhava and Vimal-amitra have been the most widely practiced in Tibet, though early on in the history of the Great Perfection there seems to have been more parity in terms of the influence these three had. In the early days of the Great Per-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"6 I GREAT PERFECTION fection, the teachings ofVimalamitra were the first to gain prominence. Vimalamitra transmitted these teachings to a few close disciples and later concealed them as treasures for future generations. The lineage then descended to Dangma Lhungyal (tenth-eleventh centuries), who received the transmissions of the oral tradition and also revealed the concealed treasures. After soine time, the influence of these teachings began to wane and the teachings of Padmasambhava began to flourish. In. the following passage from the Precious History of the Treasure, Padmasambhava shares his pre.;. dictions concerning the future of the Dzogchen teachings in Tibet with Yeshe Tsogyal: Lady Tsogyal wrote all this down and then asked, \"Should these secret instructions on the Heart Essence be propagated or concealed?\" \"The time has not yet come to spread these teachings,\" the master responded, \"so they should be concealed as treasure ... After some years the great master Vimalamitra will arrive and the time will have come for his disciples. The Heart Essence teachings will then be spread far and wide. My teachings on the Heart Essence of the Dakinis will appear once the Heart Essence teachings that were translated earlier have entered into a state of decline and are on the verge of disappearing altogether. When the earlier teachings are just about to die out, these instructions will manifest. They will do so quickly and on a vast scale, but only for a short while, like the flame of a butter lamp flaring up before it burns out.\"9 The Great Perfection teachings of these two masters came to be known as the Early Heart Essence and Later Heart Essence, respectively. Each mas-ter passed on his teachings to numerous disciples, and the transmission of the Great Perfection soon blossomed into a diverse range oflineages. The Great Perfection is rooted in the teachings of the Nyingma School, the most ancient lineage of Buddhist practice in Tibet, yet these teach-ings have also been widely practiced by many highly regarded masters of Tibet's other three main lineages. The Dalai Lamas of the Gduk lineage, the Karmapas of the Kagyii tradition, and the Khyentse incarnations of the Sakya School have all practiced and taught the Great Perfection.10"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 7 Even Milarepa (zos2-II35), the great patriarch of the Takpo Kagyii, stud-ied the Great Perfection, though his initial efforts met with failure. More recencly,Jamgon Kongtrul (z813-1899) and other lamas ofTibet's nonsec-tarian Rime movement advocated the Great Perfection as the pinnacle of the Buddha's teachings. Interestingly, even Tibet's non-Buddhist Bon reli-gion has its own strand of Great Perfection teachings, some of which are nearly identical to those presented in this very book.11 The Great Perfection is also notable for the number of female masters it has produced. Two of the earliest examples are Princess Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyal. These figures are often mentioned as the spiritual partners of Padrnasambhava, yet they were also great masters in their own right. Yeshe Tsogyal in particular played a critical role in transmitting the Great Perfection teachings to Tibet and helping to ensure their preservation for future generations. Later female masters continued to practice, transmit, and teach the Great Perfection, and many were instrumental in maintain-ing and shaping their respective lineages. One such example is Mingyur · Paldron (1699-1769) of the Mindroling lineage, whose profound writings on the Great Perfection were included by Jamgon Kongtrul in his Treasury of Precious Treasures.12 Remarkable femaie masters of recent times include Shuksep Lochen Chonyi Sangrno (z865-1953)13 and Sera Khandro (1892-1940)/4 two women who trained some of the foremost Great Perfection masters of the twentieth century, including Zhadeu Trulshik Rinpoche (!;>. 1924) and Chatral Rinpoche Sangye Dorje (b. 1913)!5 In the Nyingma School, the vast majority of Great Perfection teach-ings are contained in revealed treasures, or terma. Along with transmit-ted teachings and pure visions, treasures are one of three primary lineages through which the Nyingma teachings, including those of the Great Per-fection, are disseminated. Transmitted teaching.t, or kama, are passed on from teacher to sfudent and maintained in an unbroken continuity of study and practice, while pure vision teachings, or dak nang, can be traced to the visionary encounters between realized masters and enlightened manifestations. Pure visions often result in the composition of new litur-gical practices and, occasionally, commentarialliterature. Treasures may be either teachings or sacred objects that are hidden by a spiritual teacher for the benefit of future generations. These teachings and objects are later revealed by a reincarnation of the spiritual teacher him or herself. or by a reincarnation of one of the teacher's primary disciples.16 In Tibet, most treasures were hidden by Padmasambhava and his spiritual partner Yeshe"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"8 I GREAT PERFECTION Tsogyal, though there are numerous examples of this practice occurring in other lineages as well.17 Over the past millennium, various cycles of treasure teachings have been revealed, only to fade into obscurity decades or centuries later. Others have withstood the test of time and remain influential to this day. Of those that relate to the teachings ofVimalamitra, two of the most important are the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra, which will be discussed below, and the Heart Essence of the Karmapa, which was revealed by the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (I284-1339). More recently, an important treasure cycle was re-revealed in the nineteenth century by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (182o-I892), entitled the Heart Essence ofChetsiin.18 Relatively speaking, the number of treasure cycles linked to the teach-ings ofVimalamitra pales in comparison to the number of cycles associ-ated with Padmasambhava. Padmasambhava's concealed teachings are so numerous, in fact, that the word \"terma\" has become nearly synonymous with this great Indian siddha. It is hard to single out which of his treasure cycles are most important, but a few deserve special mention. Of the ear-liest treasure cycles to be revealed, Rigdzin Godem's (I337-I409) Unim-peded Wzsdom Mind has been held in high regard since its discovery in the fourteenth century. This cycle is still widely practiced in certain regions, such as Sikkim, and at some of the Nyingma School's most important mon-asteries, including Dorje Drak in Central Tibet. Rigdzin Godem is often mentioned alongside Guru Chowang and Nyang Ral Nyima Ozer as one of the three most important tercons. Other cycles, such as Mingyur Dor-je's (I645-I667) Space Dharma and Longsel Nyingpo's (I625-I692) revela-tions, have also been integrated into the practice curriculum of some of the Nyingma tradition's most important monastic centers, and have made a lasting impact on the trajectory of Great Perfection thought and prac-tice for this reason.'' More recently, cycles discovered by the Rime masters Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa (I829-187o) have profoundly shaped the Great Perfection tradition, as have the cycles revealed by Dudjom Rinpoche Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje (I 904-I 988) and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (19IO-I991) in the twentieth century.20 It is also worth noting that some treasure cycles are considered distil-lations of the Great Perfection teachings of both Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra. These include some of the most influential treasure revela-tions, such as Terdak Lingpa's Essence of the Profound Nature of Ati, one of the most important Dzogchen teachings in the Mindroling tradition."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 9 Another example is Jigme Lingpa's (I72.9/30-1798) Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse, the Longchen Nyingtik. This cycle is now one of the most widely practiced treasure revelations in the Nyingma world, thanks in large part to the extensive body of commentarialliterature it spawned. Two of the most well known texts from this lineage are Patrul Chokyi Wangpo's (18o8-1887) Words of My Perfect Teacher andJigme Lingpa's own instruc-tion manual on the Great Perfection, Supreme Wzsdom. --FOURFOLD HEART ESSENCE --In the fourteenth century, Longchen Rabjam compiled the Nyingma tra-dition's most famous collection of Great Perfection teachings, the Four-fold Heart Essence. This massive compilation spans thirteen volumes and contains hundreds ofindividual titles. It is perhaps the most thorough pre-sentation of the Heart Essence teachings ever put down in writing. Over the centuries, the greatest scholars and meditators of the Nyingma School have looked to these sacred texts for guidance on the most profound med-itative practices of Vajrayana Buddhism. Later works on the Great Per-fection, such as Jigme Lingpa's renowned Supreme Wisdom, draw heavily from its lucid explanations and pith instructions. Its texts are even used as a primary source of information by Tibetan historians. The Fourfold Heart Essence contains five sections: the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra (Virna Nyingtik), the Heart Essence of the Dakinis (Khandro Nyingtik), the Guru's Quintessence (Lama Yangtik), the Quintessence of the Dakinis (Khandro Yangtik), and the Profound Quintessence (Zabmo Yangtik).21 The first two sections contain the Heart Essence teachings of Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava, respectively. The following three sec-tions contain the writings of Longchenpa: The Guru's Quintessence con-tains his commentaries on Vimalamitra's teachings; the Quintessence of the Dakinis contains his clarifications of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis; and the Profound Quintessence deals with the teachings of both. In the following passage, the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche gives a brief overview of the contents of the Fourfold Heart Essence: The import of the Three Classes, the Ninefold Expanse, and all the other key instructions of the Great Perfection were con-densed by the Kashmiri scholar Vimalamitra and codified in"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"10 / GREAT PERFECTION the Secret Heart Essence, the Sangwa Nyingtik.. These teach~ ings came to be known as the vast Heart Essence of Vimala-mitra, or Virna Nyingtik. Padmasambhava, the master from Oddiyana, codified the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, or Khan-dro Nyingtik. His teachings came to be known as the pro~ found Heart Essence of Padma, or Perna Nyingtik.. The omni-scient Longchenpa then wrote brief clarifications on the first set and more extensive commentaries on the second. The former are collectively referred to as the Quintessential Wish-Fulfill-ing Jewel, .which is also known as the Guru's Quintessence, or Lama Yangtik, and the latter as the Quintessence of the Daki-nis, or Khandro Yangtik.. All of these teachings were then gath-ered into one compilation, thus condensing both the transmit-ted teachings and treasures. This collection is referred to as the Fourfold Heart Essence, the Nyingtik Yabshi.22 The Fourfold Heart Essence covers a wide range of Buddhist practices. Its two main sections, which contain.the teachings ofVimalamitra and Padmasambhava, respectively, each comprise a complete path to libera-tion. Both cycles contain a series of instructions on the outer, inner, and unique preliminary practices, as well as on the various meditations that make up the main body of tantric practice. As might be expected, the two core Heart Essence practices, breakthrough and direct leap, receive the most attention. Yet though the emphasis is clearly on these two stages, there are also numerous texts that relate to other forms ofVajrayana prac~ tice, such as the development and completion stages The Fourfold Heart Essence devotes far less attention to the develop-ment stage than the completion stage, especially in the teachings ofVimal-amitra. Moreover, its few sadhana practices are presented in a style and for-. mat that sets them apart from the more complex and lengthy development stage sadhanas of the Mahayoga tradition.23 The usual sadhana divisions of lama, yidam, and dakini are also absent. Instead, the majority of its ritual practices concern Dorje Yudronma, Sokdrup Nakmo, Danglha, and other important Dzogchen Dharma protectors. In terms of completion stage practice, a diverse range of approaches is represented. The Fourfold Heart Essence includes texts on the practices of yogic heat, luminosity, transference, yogic union, as well as extensive instructions on the various intermediate states, or bardos. Though these"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION I II practices are not unique to the Great Perfection, they are often integrated into this path as methods that prepare the student for the fruitional prac-tices of the Heart Essence. The Fourfold Heart Essence's most outstanding contribution to the Great Perfection tradition is its extensive treatment of the breakthrough and direct leap, the most fundamental practices of the Heart Essence tradition. Longchenpa's collection contains scores of texts that relate to these two stages. These include detailed instructions on the unique Heart Essence preliminary practices, which are covered extensively in the trans-lation of The Excellent Chariot that follows, as well as elegant poems and detailed treatises designed to lead the meditator first to a recognition of the originally pure nature of mind, and then to an experience of its sponta-neously present manifestations. In contrast to Longchenpa's Seven Treasuries, which outline the philo-sophical underpinnings of the Great Perfection, the texts of the Fourfold Heart Essence are short and to the point. They are not intended to be theoretical expositions, but practical guides to the subtleties of medita-tion. As such, they are often pithy and evocative, and many are just a few pages in length.24 Not all of its texts deal strictly with practice, however. As with most treasure cycles, the teachings contained in the Fourfold Heart Essence center on a number of important tantras.251here are also numer-ous biographies oflineage masters, detailed lineage histories, and instruc-tion manuals that explain how to bestow the empowerments of the Great Perfection. THE HEART ESSENCE OF VIMALAMITRA AND GuRu's QUINTESSENCE The Heart Essence o~Vimalamitra contains the Dzogchen teachings that Longchenpa received from his own root guru, Kumaradza {n66-1343). The Indian master Vimalamitra first gave these teachings in secret to five disciples during his sojourn to Tibet. As mentioned in the previous sec-tion, these teachings were then passed on as an oral transmission, and also written down and hidden as treasures by Vimalamitra's student Nyang Tingdzin Zangpo (eighth-ninth centuries). CentUries later they were revealed by Dangma Lhungyal and propagated by Chetsiin Senge Wang-chuk {eleventh-twelfth centuries).

The first grouping of texts in this collection is divided into four catego-ries: the Golden Lettered, the Conch Lettered, the Turquoise Lettered, and the Copper Lettered and Ornamented Letters, which are grouped together. Of these four, the apdy entided Golden Lettered group forms the core of the Heart Essence ofVimalamitra. It contains a lengthy inventory of the contents of the collection, a root tantra, as well as a lengthy commentary on this tantra composed by Garap Dorjc. The Golden Lettered collection also includes a series of teachings called \"last testaments.\" The first group, of last testaments includes three teach-ings transmitted by the buddha Vajradhara to Garap Dorjc. These three are called the Three Last Testaments of the Buddha. The next set, entided the:: Four Last Testaments of the Masters of Awareness, consists offour post-humous teachings transmitted by the very first Great Perfection· masters. These four texts contain what are, perhaps, the most famous Heart Essence teachings in the entire Great Perfection lineage: Garap Dorje's Three State-ments That Strike the Vital Point, Manjushrimitra's Six Experiences of Medi-tation, Shri Simha's Seven Nails, and Jnanasutra's Six Methods of Resting. A fifth testament by Vimalamitra is also included. The remaining volumes of the collection contain a wealth of material on the intricacies of Great Perfection practice. Many of the texts are filled with annotations that flesh out the cryptic root verses. Most are quite brief, with some just a few pages long. The majority of these texts deal with the Great Perfection's breakthrough and direct leap practices, and there is a notable absence of ritual-based sadhana literature. 26 There are, however, nearly two hundred pages devoted to the various empowerments of the Vima Nyingtik, as well as a lengthy lineage history and numerous biogra-phies of important lineage masters. Longchenpa's commentaries on the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra fill two volumes. Collectivdy, these commentaries are entided the Guru's Quintessence, though they are more popularly known as the Quintes-sential Wish-fulfillingJewd, or Yangtik Yizhin Norbu. Of all Longchen-pa's writings-which remain unrivaled as comprehensive presentations of Great Perfection thought and practice-this collection is hdd in espe-cially high regard. It was this body of writings that the great master him-self directed his students to consult when in doubt concerning their Great Perfection meditation.

According to Longchenpa, the unique contribution of the Garland of Pearls is the series of skillful key instructions it employs to bring about liberation.28 Elaborating further, the Third Karmapa, Rang-jung Dorje, explains that the Garland ofPearls shows the practitioner how to develop his or her meditation by fully integrating the fruitional state, and how to recognize the various experiential signs that herald the onset of true realization?9 As with the other sections of the Fourfold Heart Essence, the Guru's Quintessence covers a broad range of topics. It opens with an inventory of its contents, a lineage history, and supplications and offering rituals meant to serve as preliminary practices.

Its texts lay out straightforward guidelines for each and every"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":". 14 I GREAT PERFECTION stage of the Heart Essence, starting with the common preliminary prac-tices, and then progressing through the unique Dzogchen preliminaries, the various stages of tantric practice, and finally to the practices of break-through and direct leap. Padmasambhava sought out the Heart Essence teachings after receiving a prophecy from the dakini Vajravarahi, who told him that his destined teacher was Shri Simha. Once he found this master, he dwelt in the char-nel grounds of ancient India for twenty-five years studying and practicing the teachings he received. At the close of the eighth century, the Dharma king Trisong Deutsen invited Padmasambhava to Tibet to help' construct Samye Monastery. While there, he taught the entire range of Buddhist teachings and helped plant the Dharma firmly in Tibetan soil. Padmasambhava transmitted the Heart Essence teachings in secret to a few close disciples. He first taught the Heart Essence of the Dakinis to Yeshe Tsogyal at the cave complex ofZhoto Tidro in Central Tibet, and later at Samye Chimpu. The following passage from the Precious History of the Treasure recounts how this transmission took place:30 One time the master Padmasambhava was practicing at Zhoto Tidro Trak along with his spiritual partner, Lady Tsogyal of Kharchen. While they were there, wisdom dakinis exhorted Yeshe Tsogyal with the following prophetic declaration: \"The enlightened mind of this great master, the nirmanakaya bud-dha, holds a set of profound key instructions called the Heart Essence of the Dakinis. These direct instructions bring buddha-hood in three years and cause the corporeal aggregates to disap-pear in this very life. You must request these teachings!\" Hearing this, Yeshe Tsogyal offered a great ta.ntric feast arid requested the teachings.· \"Great master,\" she said, \"please give me the direct instructions that will cause the aggregates to dis-appear and bring buddhahood in this very life. Please bestow upon me the key instructions of the Heart Essence!\" With this sqpplication, she made innumerable prostrations and circumambulations, upon which the great master replied, \"Tsogyal, your request is an excellent one, for I possess instruc-tions that are unlike those I have given you in the past.

He taught them all the Sev-enteen Tantras, with the Tantra of the Clear Expanse of the Sun as the eighteenth, along with a great many key instructions.31' All these teachings were then grouped into two categories. The first set contained key instructions on the vastness of the tantras, while the seco~d collection was composed by the master himself and contained cycles for simple yogis. Each was then committed to writing and cataloged by the master and Yeshe Tsogyal. It was at this time that the king extended an invitation to the niaster and his spiritual partner to visit Chimpu. The two then set off, accompanied by the king, the queen, and the royal chil-dren. Once there, they began a series of one hundred and eight tantric feasts. 'During the course of these feasts, a young, eight-year-old princess named Pcmasd, the daughter of the noble Queen Changchup Men of the Drom clan, passed away. Seeing her body, the king burst into tears and fell to the floor uncon-scious. Yeshe Tsogyal then covered him with a white sash and sprinkled him with sandalwood water, upon which the king regained consciousness.

Nothing whatsoever is stable and permanent, So do not believe the impermanent to be permanent. Instead train in the nature of the birthless dharinakaya!\" To these words of advice, the master added many prophecies concerning future events and told the king about the series of incarnations that Princess Pemasel was to take. At the conclu-sion of all this, he prophesied the coming ofTsultrim Dorje and Trime (her. The princess was commanded to be the guardian of the profound Heart Essence teachings, and they were then concealed as a profound treasure. Later, just as the master had prophesied, these teachings were revealed by the omniscient Tsultrim Dorje and spread far and wide by Trime Ozer.32 As noted here, the Heart Essence of the Dak.inis was hidden as treasure and then revealed by the reincarnation of Princess Pemasel, Perna Ledrel Tsel. Longchenpa was the immediate reincarnation of Perna Ledrel Tsel. He came into contact with the treasure revelations of his previous incarna-tion, and also received the Heart Essence teachings directly from Padma-sambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal in a visionary state. The details of these trans-missions are discussed extensively in The Excellent Chariot.

These six tantras are accompanied by six short commentaries.

Following these testaments, there is a more lengthy commentary on the six essence tantras, entitled Essential Instructions on the Essence Tantras That Liberate upon Wearing. This grouping of texts, which forms the core of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, contains some of the most frequently quoted literature in the entire Great Perfection tradition. The next two texts are the main sadhana practices of this cycle, the Outer and Inner Sadhanas of the Sugatas. Following these two concise ritual prac-tices is an extensive series of texts that present the various levels of empow-erment. The following passage gives an overview of these empowerments and their relationship to Heart Essence practices: To begin, novice practitioners should be granted the vase empowerment and instructed to practice the approach of the threefold ritual of the yidams of the five buddha families. They should then meditate on these yidams until the experiential signs of success have manifested in their entirety. Next, bestow the secret empowerment and instruct them to meditate on a suitable yogic heat practice until all the experiential signs of suc-cess for this practice have manifested. Once this has come to pass, grant the knowledge-wisdom empowerment and have.the students utilize a mudra until the hindu is workable and there is some degree of facility concerning the nature of bliss-empti~ ness. Then bestow the word empowerment and instruct them to meditate on the breakthrough stage until its nature has been recognized. Following this, bestow the empowerment into the display of awareness and introduce the direct leap, instructing them to meditate until the four visions have reached a point of perfection. There is nothing wrong with bestowing all of these empowerments\"'and instructions simultaneously, but doing so in a gradual manner is particularly effective.33 A number of practice-related teachings follow this series of empowerment texts. The second volume of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis begins with a text entitled Questions and Answers: A Rosary of Golden Amrita. This won-derful composition contains a dialogue between Yeshe Tsogyal and Padma-sambhava, in which Yeshe Tsogyal requests clarifications concerning the view, meditation, and conduct of the Great Perfection. Following this are"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"18 I GREAT PERFECTION a number of completion stage writings, including pithy teachings on the practices of yogic union, the intermediate states, luminosity, yogic heat, and the extraction of essences. The volume continues with texts related to the protector practices of the cycle; outer, inner, and secret guru yoga prac~ tices; short texts on the breakthrough and direct leap practices; writings on various usages of the cycle's tantras; writings on the interm,ediate states; and various prophecies, supplications, and lineage histories. Summarizing the unique contribution of this cycle, Terdak Lingpa writes: Generally speaking, in other classes of tantra found in the Vajray~ ana, the meaning is concealed usingvajra words. In contrast, this meaning is taught explicitly in the Seventeen Tantras and the commentaries that elucidate their essential meaning. In particu~ lar, the style and approach of the Six Essence Tantras 1hat Liber-ate upon Wearing, the 1hree Last Testaments of the Buddha, and the key instructions on these teachings composed by the Great One ofUddiyana and his spiritual partner are in harmony inso-far as they all teach the innermost realization of the buddhas. This eminent and supreme path, the profound and secret Great Perfection, is what we now know as the \"Heart Essence of the Dakinis.\" In this tradition, symbolic representations are used to point out the true, fundamental nature of things. For those for-tunate individuals with a karmic connection to these teachings, this provides an unsurpassed avenue for bringing about a swift realization of this true nature.34 Longchenpa's commentaries on the Heart Essence of the Dakinis span three volumes. Of all his works, this collection receives a unique level of praise as one of the most significant contributions to the practice literature of the Great Perfection. In terms of its length and systematic structure, it is certainly one of the most comprehensive presentations of Heart Essence practice ever composed, yet its true contribution lies in the seemingly lim-itless pith instructions it contains and its marvelously clear instructions on the subtleties of Great Perfection meditation practice. Commenting on the unique status of this collection, Dudjom Rinpoche writes: It is clear that in the land of snow mountains all the other writ~ ings on the [Heart Essence], those which are considered to be"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 19 profound, contain not even a fraction of the profound points which are elucidated in this ocean of indestructible reality, the mind treasure of this second Samantabhadra.35 As might be expected, the circumstances surrounding the composition of these texts were far from ordinary. In fact, though its contents are com-mentaries, the Quintessence of the Dakinis is also considered a mind trea-sure.36 Longchenpa received the transmission of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis directly from Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal in a visionary state, an encounter that is said to have lasted six days. The following passage relates the wondrous circumstances that surrounded these transmissions: One winter, in the Year of the Female Wood Rabbit, Longchenpa was practicing at Chimpu Hill in Rimochen Cave, along with eight of his fortunate male and female students. As he was giv-ing them the empowerments and explanations of the Secret Heart Essence, many protectors and dakinis suddenly arrived and exhorted him to begin teaching the Heart Essence of the Dakinis. He then sent the yogi Ozer Kocha to fetch the texts. When they gathered together later, the practitioners there could actually see all the innumerable gatherings of dakinis that were taking place. At night, the din of the dakinis' natural sounds could be heard in every direction, as could various instru-ments. The yogis and yoginis, each and every one, had neither dreams that indicated that they were asleep, nor anything that showed they were wide awake. Instead, everyone remained in a state of blissful, clear, and thought-free wisdom day and night for an entire month. When introductions were given, everyone beheld the light>of deep, pervasive blue, as well as the light of the fivefold wisdom. When instructions were given, and during the course of all the supportive teachings, the entire sky would fill with rainbows. This went on for an entire month. When Longchenpa composed the treatises of the great Heart Essence commentaries that have come to be known as the Quin-tessence of the Dakinis, various wondrous omens occurred. A great many beings were brought to the state of liberation and omniscience through the empowerments, explanations, and instructions of the Heart Essence.37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":":z.o I GREAT PERFECTION As in the other cycles of the Fourfold Heart Essence, the first two texts in this collection are an inventory of the cycle's contents and a lineage his-tory. Following this is a lengthy empowerment text, a series of writings on various preparatory practices, and finally two groups of three texts on the breakthrough and direct leap. A single five-hundred-page treatise takes up almost the entire second volume. Entitled An Ocean of Clouds of the Profound Reality, this vast text is the longest composition in the Fourfold Heart Essence. It offers a com-prehensive presentation of Great Perfection thought and practice, from descriptions of the ground of reality to practical instructions on tantric practice, all the way up to the fruition of Great Perfection meditation. This is a rare example of Great Perfection literature that gives equal attention to both the theoretical grounding of the Heart Essence and its practical implementation, treating both in an incredibly detailed manner. It also covers related topics such as the lineage history of the Great Perfection and the various samaya vows associated with the four empowerments. The third and final volume of the collection contains a great number of practice-related texts. It includes texts on the development stage, comple-tion stage, and of course Heart Essence practice proper: the breakthrough and direct leap. There are also various texts associated with a sadhana of the five buddha families, as well as various rituals and Dharma protector practices. The fifi:h and final component of the Fourfold Heart Essence is the Pro-found Quintessence, which comprises the final two volumes of the col-lection. As mentioned earlier, this compilation contains instructions that relate to the teachings of both Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava. For the most part, this collection contains further instructions and clarifications of the teachings contained in the preceding sections of the Fourfold Heart Essence. One interesting addition is a short text on the direct leap practice of dark retreat.381he Profound Quintessence is not as comprehensive or systematically organized as the other components of the Fourfold Heart Essence and contains no inventory. --PRACTICING THE HEART ESSENCE --The first step an aspiring Dzogchen practitioner must take is to seek out a qualified teacher. The qualities needed by teachers and students of the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION I 2.1 Great Perfection are explained extensively in the first half of The Excel-lent Chariot (contained in Great Perfection: Outer and Inner Preliminar-ies). Once a committed student has made a heartfelt connection with a genuine Dzogchen master, the next step is to follow the teacher's instruc-tions, which usually entails practicing the outer and inner preliminaries. The outer preliminaries consist of a series of contemplations designed to dicit a feeling of disenchantment towards mundane activities, along with a sense of enthusiasm towards the state of liberation and the practices that lead to this state. This attitude of joyful renunciation ensures that one's practice on the spiritual path doesn't end up reinforcing ordinary states of desire and attachment. The inner preliminaries build on this foundation by clearing away obstacles and obscurations, while simultaneously creat-ing circumstances that set the stage for realization to take place. Once the mind has been thoroughly trained and refined via these preliminary steps, the advanced practices ofbreakthrough and direct leap are utilized to help the meditator first identify the pure, nondual awareness that permeates all experience, and then hasten the process of realization by working directly with the active manifestations of reality itsel£ The following passage highlights the various stages that comprise this process, starting at the fruitional state ofbuddhahood, and then working backwards to show all the steps leading up to this fruition: Generally speaking, all the inconceivable number of teach-ings, treatises, and key instructions that have been transmitted by the buddhas, bodhisattvas, gurus, and siddhas are nothing more than skillful ways to bring about the attainment of bud-dhahood, the perfect fruition of the twofold benefit. To attain buddhahood, one must utilize the practical instructions of the profound path of the direct leap to bring the conscious effort and concepts associated with materiality to a point of exhaus-tion. To reach such a point, one must completely perfect the dis-play of the self-manifest mandala. For this to take place, mani-fest appearances must evolve, which necessitates witnessing the appearances of manifest [reality]. To wimess these appearances, one must completely purify and eliminate all of the afflictions in one's own stream of consciousness, yet without repressing the afflictions (as is done by the listeners). This takes place by practicing breakthrough, the nature of the ground. For this to"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"2.1 I GREAT PERFECTION happen, the wisdom of insight must arise, as this will lead to the realization that the very essence of the afHictions is fundamen-tally free of all elaborations. To arouse the wisdom of insight, one must be able to rest the mind one-pointedly in a state of tranquility, which, in turn, means that one must let go of mun-dane activities and attachment to this present life. Each of these paths must be actualized in dependence upon the path that pre-cedes it. This will take place when the stages outlined here are traversed one by one in the correct manner, like the rungs on a ladder.39 Each step outlined in the preceding passage has a corresponding practice, or set of practices, assc:>ciated with it. THE OUTER AND INNER PRELIMINARIES To begin, the student must complete the outer and inner preliminary prac-tices mentioned above. Over the centuries, these preliminary practices have gradually taken on a fairly rigid structure. The current formulation of the four contemplations that change the mind as the outer preliminaries, and the sequence of refuge, bodhichitta, Vajrasattva, mandala, and guru yoga a.S the inner preliminaries, was not always the standard form of practice. In the Heart Essence ofVimalamitra, for example, the outer preliminar-ies consist of a seven-point contemplation that differs quite significantly from the standard format just mentioned.~ These seven points do address common themes like impermanence, karma, and the nature of samsara, yet they also contain instructions on practices normally considered more advanced than the relatively accessible meditations of the standard formu-lation. The seventh point, in particular, contains a three-step process in which the meditator uses a simplified version of completion stage practice to meditate on bliss-emptiness, clarity-emptiness, and nonconceptuality. Longchenpa's instructions on the third and final step bear a striking simi-larity to his teachings on breakthrough practice. He writes: To train the mind in nonconceptual reality, relax your body and mind from deep within. Without moving your eyes, meditate in a state free from conceptual discursiveness and withdrawal, and devoid of thoughts and memories.41"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 2.3 Though not as widely practiced as the standard formulation, this seven-fold contemplation is preserved in at least two lineages that are actively practiced today.42 Another interesting presentation is given. in Longchenpa's Profound Quintessence. In a text entitled Precious Instructions on the Common Pre-liminaries, the ordinary progression of the outer and inner preliminaries is completely reversed: The student begins by practicing guru yoga, followed by the mandala offering and contemplations of the precious human exis-tence, impermanence, the suffering of samsara, and the principle of karma. Next is the cultivation of faith and compassion, then a meditation on the dreamlike, illusory quality of experience. Two subtle body yogas designed to elicit an experience of nonconceptuality conclude the presentation. Keep in mind that all of these practices are presented here as outer prelim-inaries. Most contemporary formulations, in contrast, list these practices as either inner preliminaries or main practices, with the exception of the fourfold contemplation listed above.43 The Heart Essence of the Dakinis contains a number of differ~nt for-mulations of these preliminary practices. In The Sun, Moon, and Stars, Longchenpa lays out a six-year plan in which complete liberation is said to coincide with the completion of the teachings.-14 In this extensive approach, the preliminary phase takes six months: one month contemplating imper-manence, one month on the shortcomings of samsara, one month on the principle of karma, one month on the freedoms and endowments com-bined with Vajrasatrva, one month on the outer, inner, and secret manda-las, and one month of guru yoga. Noticeably absent from this structure are refuge and bodhichitta, presumably because all Mahayana and Vajrayana practices implicitly contain these two elements. One of the most well-known commentaries on the Heart Essence of the Dakinis is Terdak Lingpa's Illuminating the Profound Path!5 This text sets out a fivefold version of the preliminaries: impermanence; refuge, compassion and bodhichitta, Vajrasatrva, and guru yoga. As the basis for this formulation, the author cites a passage from the Last Testament that instructs the meditator to \"train in impermanence, compassion, and bodhichitta.\"46 Elaborating on this approach, he explains that this simpli-fied version of the preliminaries highlights those principles that are of cen-tral importance. For the beginner, however, it is more beneficial to take a more extensive approach, in which subsidiary topics like the precious-ness of human existence are explicitly addressed. This latter approach, he"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"2.4 / GREAT PERFECTION concludes, is clearest and in harmony with the general presentation of the Great Vehicle.47 According to The Excellent Chariot, the primary practice manual used at Dzogchen Monastery, the outer and inner preliminaries are to be prac-ticed in tandem, rather than sequentially as is often the case. The sequence of these practices is as follows: contemplation of the precious human exis-tence is paired with refuge, impermanence with bodhichitta, karma with the three vows, the suffering of samsara with Vajrasattva, the benefits of liberation with mandala offering, and faith with guru yoga.48 These prac-tices are explained in the first half of The Excellent Chariot. Of all the outer and inner preliminaries, the practice of guru yoga is taught to be of paramount importance in the Great Perfection. In guru yoga, the student's mind merges with the wisdom mind of the guru. When the devotion of the student is sincere and heartfelt, this merging of minds can bring about an immediate and profound shift in consciousness. In the following passage, Patrul cites Longchenpa, stressing the importance of this practice: In the development stage, completion stage, and other such practices, it is not the essence of the path that brings liberation, as one must also utilize certain factors to work with one's con-duct and deepen one's practice. In guru yoga, however, it is the essence of the path alone that triggers a realization of the true nature within, and which thus leads to liberation. For this very reason, guru yoga is the most profound of all paths.49 THE UNIQ_UE HEART ESSENCE PRELIMINARIES Once the student has completed the outer and inner preliminaries, the next step is to practice the unique preliminaries of the Heart Essence teachings: the outer and inner separations of samsara and nirvana (known in Tibet as korde rushen); the physical, verbal, and mental preliminaries; and the practices of resting in the natural state and revitalization. These practices, all of which are discussed extensively in The Excellent Chariot, prepare the student for the advanced practices of breakthrough and direct leap. 50 As with the outer and inner preliminaries, there is no set order for the unique preliminaries; each lineage has its own distinct approach. Even within the Heart Essence of the Dakinis a number of different presenta-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 2.5 tions are given. In the First Testament of the Buddha, for example, the inner separation is mentioned first, followed by the practices of resting in the natural state and revitalization. In the Second Testament of the Buddha, the outer separation is linked with the physical, verbal, and mental preliminar-ies: first the physical aspect of the outer separation is practiced followed by the vajra stance, then the verbal separation and the four HUM yogas, and finally the mental separation and mental preliminary of analyzing the ori-gin, presence, and departure of the mind. Following these are the practices of resting in the natural state and revitalization. The Third Testament of the Buddha deals solely with the direct leap and does not address these unique preliminaries. Thus, though they do address the individual practices of the Heart Essence, it is difficult to discern their order due to the fact that each of the three testaments has a different orientation and presentation. The next text in the Heart Essence of the Dakinis is entitled Essential Instructions on the Essence Tantras That Liberate upon J#aring. In this short set of instructions, Garap Dorje condenses the content of the tantras and key instructions into a more accessible format with a clearly structured set of practices. This presentation is based on the first of the three testa-ments. Following the condensed version of the outer and inner prelimi-naries {meditating on impermanence, compassion, and bodhichitta), the student is advised to practice the inner separation. No mention is made of the outer separation or the physical, verbal, and mental preliminaries. Resting in the natural state and revitalization are included in the main practice, rather than the preliminaries. They are also considered a single practice. One uses the gazes presented in the practice of revitalization to rest in the natural state, rather than first gaining familiarity with the natu-ral state and then using the practice of revitalization to integrate this state with mild, moderate, and intense activities. It is important to note that here, \"natural stat? is equated with the nature of mind, i.e., breakthrough. In later presentations, \"natural state\" is taken to mean unfabricated, not in the sense of the \"natural\" nonmeditation of breakthrough, but rather formless tranquility.51 · As mentioned earlier, Longchenpa's Sun, Moon, and Stars contains the single most elaborate and comprehensive approach to Heart Essence prac-tice found in the Heart Essence of the Dakinis. One interesting feature of this system is that the unique Heart Essence preliminaries are practiced in conjunction with the four empowerments and the \"main practices\" linked to them, namely the various development and completion stage yogas."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"2.6 I GREAT PERFECTION Following the six-month preparatory period oudined above, the student and teacher commence a series of empowerments and their correspond-ing practices. The first step entails the bestowal of a dakini empowerment, followed by three months of practice. Next is the vase empowerment and six months of practicing the outer and inner sadhanas of the five buddha families. Following this are twenty days of the physical outer separation practice and ten days of the vajra pose. Note here that Longchenpa follows the traditional approach of breaking the outer separation practice into its physical, verbal, and mental components and practicing them in tandem with the preliminaries of the three gates. Once these practices have been· completed, the secret empowerment is bestowed. At this stage, one practices the verbal separation for twenty days, each of the HUM yogas for twenty days, the inner separation for one month and ten days, yogic heat for one month, and other subde body prac-tices for three months. Following these practices, the knowledge-wisdom empowerment. is bestowed and one practices the mental separation for twenty days and the mental preliminary of analyzing the origin, presence, and departure of the mind for nine days. Next, the state of tranquility is introduced by resting in the natural state and practicing revitalization for three days each, and finally a series of subde body practices are practiced for a total of six months and ten days. These stages conclude the unique preliminaries, after which the word empowerment is bestowed in conjunc-_tion with the practice ofbreakthrough and the empowerment into the dis-play of awareness in conjunction with the direct leap. 51 In two of the most well-known commentaries on the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, Terdak Lingpa's Illuminating the Profound Path and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche's Excellent Chariot, the unique Heart Essence pre-liminaries are structured differendy. Both of these texts present the physi-cal, verbal, and mental elements of the outer separation as a single practice. The inner separation follows this outer separation, after which one prac-tices the preliminaries of the three gates, resting in the natural state, and finally revitalization. This sequence is explained in detail in The Excellent Chariot. 53 In the Heart Essence ofVimalamitra yet another approach is taken. To the preliminaries mentioned above, a practice involving the sounds of the four elements is added. 54 In some systems stemming from this lineage, the practice of the four elements and the outer and inner separation practices"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 1.7 are not addressed, or are mentioned only in passing. In his Background Teachings on the Direct Leap from the Guru's Quintessence, Longchenpa clearly emphasizes the importance of the preliminaries of the three gates relative to these other practices. In this text, he explains the preliminaries of the three gates as the main preliminary practices, while concerning the yogas of the four elements and the separation practices, he states, \"It is per-missible to precede the preliminaries of the three gates by training in the sounds and nature of the four elements and the conduct of the separation of samsara and nirvana, or to simply skip these steps.\"ss Some instruction manuals orrut these practices altogether.S6 In other traditions, certain preliminaries are linked with the practice of breakthrough and others with the direct leap, though again there is no standard presentation. In Stages of the Path: The Essence of Wisdom, from the Chokling Tersar lineage, the preliminaries of the three gates, resting in the natural state, and revitalization are presented as a preparatory practice for the breakthrough stage, while the outer and inner separation are listed as the preliminaries for the direct leap. In his well-known Essence of Wis-dom, Adzom Drukpa explains this approach:s7 Once those who are internalizing the view, meditation, and conduct of the breakthrough have attained stability, the entire range of thoughts that comprise all that appears and exists will be understood and experienced as the display and play of aware-ness. Practicing the so-called \"unique preliminaries\" at this point, even if one has already done so in the past, is especially effective. Hence, practicing the separation prior to the direct leap is a wonderful approach. sa Yet another system is found in Clarifying the Practice of the Heart Essence, which stems from the Northern Treasure tradition ofRigdzin Godem.ln this text, breakthrough is preceded by the outer separation practice, while the physical and verbal preliminaries, inner separation, resting in the natu-ral state, and revitalization are practiced prior to the direct leap (the mental preliminary is not included in this system). Other widely practiced manu-als contain yet more unique presentations of these practices.s9 Thus, while there is clearly no set order to these practices, the individual Heart Essence lineages all contain some variation of the preliminaries discussed here."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"2.8 I GREAT PERFECTION THE MAIN PRACTICES OF THE HEART ESSENCE Following the outer, inner, and unique preliminary practices, the student will ideally be ready to start the main practices of the Great Perfection: the development stage and completion stage. In the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, the practices of these two stages are linked with five empower-ments: the vase empowerment, secret empowerment, knowledge-wisdom empowerment, word empowerment, and the empowerment into the dis-play of awareness. The latter of these five is unique to the Great Perfec-tion teachings. Terdak Lin.gpa's commentary on the Heart Essence of the Dakinis shows the link between these empowerments and the practices of development and completion: If one wishes to guide mature students through the entire path of development and completion, they should begin by train-ing their minds with the preliminary practices. Next, the vase empowerment should be offered along with teachings on the outer and inner development stage sadhanas of the five bud-dha families. Following this, the secret empowerment should be granted with teachings on the path of yogic heat, then the knowledge-wisdo~ _empowerment along with the path of the spiritual partner. Next, the word empowerment may be offered with teachings on the breakthrough stage of original purity, and the empowerment into the display of awareness along with the path of the direct leap.60 This passage shows the most common progression of tantric practice in the Nyingma School. The practitioner begins with the preliminary practices outlined above. In the next phase, the student receives the vase empowerment and practices the development stage. In development stage practice, the meditator uses the visualization of pure realms and deities, mantra recitation, and meditative absorption to disrupt the ordinary pro-cesses of distorted perception and replace them with the pure appearances of a divine mandala. Such practices may have one deiry or a pair of deities as their focal point, and typically involve the recitation oflengthy liturgies and numerous repetitions of sacred mantras.61 By absorbing one's mind in these visualized appearances and mantric sounds, the habitual tendency to view the world as impure and problematic is progressively refined away."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 2.9 Eventually, one's mind, and then even the body, merges with this divine identity.62 Though development stage practice is an effective method for undo-ing the habitual patterns associated with impure perception, it can also lead to a fixation on the newly developed pure vision of reality. The com-pletion stage functions to counteract this tendency, and also to help the practitioner identify and directly experience the subtle energetic body and the empty radiance of pure awareness. There are two main divisions of completion stage practice: completion stage with symbolic attributes and completion stage without symbolic attributes. In the former, emphasis is placed on working with the subtle energies of the body and, in particu-lar, on bringing the energies of the right and left channels into the central channel. In the completion stage without symbolic attributes, the nature of mind is emphasized. This includes formless practices such as Mahamu-dra and the breakthrough stage of the Great Perfection. The passage above states that once a practitioner has received the vase empowerment and meditated on the development stage, they should be given the secret empowerment and instructions on the practice of yogic heat (a completion stage practice with symbolic attributes). Though this practice is often associated with the Kagyii tradition's Six Dharmas of Naropa, it is also commonly practiced in the Nyingma School. This yoga, known in Tibet as tummo, employs visualization techniques, along with physical and breathing exercises, to create a blazing, blissful sensation that fills the entire body. This blazing bliss incinerates all forms of confusion and negativity, removes blockages in the central channel, and swiftly acti-vates the practitioner's innate wisdom. The knowledge-wisdom empow-erment is bestowed in the next phase along with instructions related to sexual union with a spiritual partner. Following these tWO stages, the sacred word empowerment is bestowed along with instructions on the breakthrough stage. Of the two Heart Essence practices, breakthrough is designed for those inclined to an effort-less approach, where the focus is on emptiness and original purity. In this phase of practice, which is explained extensively in the translation of The Excellent Chariot that follows, the meditator is introduced to awareness, or rigpa. By this time, the teacher and student will ideally have developed a mutual trust in one another. The student's devotion, coupled with the teacher's realization, will set the stage for a direct realization of the nature of mind on the student's part. Once awareness has been pointed out and"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"30 I GREAT PERFECTION recognized, ·the main practice consists of repeatedly familiarizing oneself with this experience until it becomes a stable, living experience. In the final stage, the empowerment into the display of awareness is bestowed and the meditations of the direct leap are taught. As noted before, this practice enables the practitioner to work directly with the appearances of reality itself, through which a series of four visions gradu-ally unfold. This style of practice is geared towards those who are more industrious by nature. Here, the focus is on luminosity, rather than empti-ness, and spontaneous presence. Though the p~ogression laid out here is a common approach in the Nyingma School, there are also more concise styles of practice that reflect the simplicity of the Heart Essence teachings. In Ihe Excellent Chariot, for example, the various empowerments are not linked with the comple-tion stage practices just mentioned, but with the unique preliminaries dis-cussed above. The Third Dzogchen Rinpoche writes: The various instructions that have been given up to this point should be practiced in conjunction with the four empower-ments, as taught by the omniscient lord of Dharma in the Quintessence of the Dakinis. Once the elaborate vase empow-erment has been bestowed, one should begin by contemplat-ing the rarity of the opportunities and endowments, and then proceed through the physical preliminary of the vajra stance. Next, the unelaborate, secret empowerment is given and one practices the verbal preliminaries. Following this, the knowl-edge-wisdom empowerment is bestowed in conjunction with the mental preliminaries, and then the word empowerment in tandem with probing the conceptual mind and seeking out its hidden flaw. 63 The breakthrough-oriented approach outlined here is unique in the Heart Essence tradition. Most Heart Essence instruction manuals pres-ent the breakthrough and direct leap stages together, often placing more emphasis on the latter in terms oflength of discussion.64ln Ihe Excellent Chariot, only a passing reference is made to the direct leap. In the colo-phon, the author instructs the reader to consult Terdak Lingpa's commen-tary on the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, Illuminating the Profound Path, should he/she be inclined to practice the direct leap. Despite the fact that"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION I 31 this stage is not taught, it is said that twenty-eight Great Perfection yogis attained rainbow body by relying solely on this text.65 In contrast to the unique preliminaries, there is no standard set of prac-tices that constitute breakthrough meditation. Though some meditations and pointing out instructions may be shared, each lineage has its own dis-tinct way of presenting them. One of the more extensive presentations of breakthrough practice is found in Longchenpa's Essential Instructions on Breakthrough, from his Guru's Quintessence. In this manual, break-through practice is divided into three phases: (I) the preparatory step of dismantling the mind's abode, (2) the main practice of introducing aware-ness in its original state, and (3) the concluding step of sustaining one's experience of awareness. The first of these entails three steps: an analysis of the origin, presence, and departure of mind, an analysis of whether the mind is unitary or composite, and an analysis of the naked observation of one's own original state. The main body of the practice consists of being introduced to awareness in its original state, at which point the guru gives a series of experiential pointing out instructions to trigger a recognition of the nature of mind in the student. In the third and final phase, the student is instructed to simply mainta!n.this recognition.66 A text entitled Pointing Out the Breakthrough: The Spacious Expanse of Liberation from Extremes outlines the structure of the most common presentation of breakthrough practice in the Heart Essence of the Daki-nis. Although breakthrough instructions are found in other central texts of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, including the Last Testaments and Essential Instructions on the Essence Tantras That Liberate upon Wearing, it is in this text that one finds the full range ofbreakthrough contemplations and pointing out instructions as they are structured in later commentaries, such as those by Terdak Lingpa and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche. This short text presents not only the structure ofbreakthrough practice that has become standard in this particular lineage, but also many of the scriptural quotations cited throughout Great Perfection literature. According to this approach, breakthrough practice consists of a series of three contemplations, followed by a sevenfold set of pointing out instruc-tions. The first contemplation is termed probing the conceptual mind, or, more literally, cutting through to the very· root of conceptuality. In this con-templation, the practitioner inquires into what it is that cycles through samsara, experiences happiness and suffering, and attains liberation. This practice aims to bring about a sense of inner certainty that the mind is at"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"32. I GREAT PERFECTION the root of everything. In the next contemplation, seeking out the mind's hidden flaw, the practitioner analyzes the mind's qualities and its relation-ship to sensory experience, emotions, and thoughts. With this practice, one comes to feel certain that the mind cannot be found anywhere or iden-tified in any way. The third contemplation is an analysis of the origin, presence, and departure of the mind, similar to the mental preliminary mentioned ear-lier. In both cases, the point is to see that the mind does not exist in any way whatsoever. According to Longchenpa, the reason for practicing this analysis twice is that the mental preliminary focuses on the objective set-ting of the mind. In other words, one looks f9r the location where the mind arises, abides, and ce<~Ses. Here, however, one analyzes the subjective mind itself, rather than its location, the aim in this case being to recognize its essence.67 Once the meditator has a thorough grounding in these contemplations and a stable sense of certainty that transcends mere intellectual under-standing, the next step is to receive a series of seven pointing out instruc-tions.68 In the commentaries of Terdak Lingpa and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche, these seven instructions are included as part of a larger three-fold outline. According to these two instruction manuals, awareness is first pointed out via the transmission of blessings, then through the view, and finally on the basis of meditative experience. The seven pointing out instructions mentioned above constitute the second of these three steps. The first stage that precedes these seven introductions is essentially a group guru yoga practice, in which both the teacher and student supplicate the root and lineage gurus, merge their minds together, and then simply rest in the ensuing state. Both Terdak Lingpa and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche note that while this stage is not explicitly addressed in the root texts of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, this practice carries a great deal of blessings and is capable of triggering a powerful experience of the teachings.69 In the sevenfold pointing out instruction, the guru points out the nature of mind by imparting pith instructions on the view. These seven steps, which stem from the Essential Instructions on the Essence Tantras That Liberate upon Ulearing, are as follows: (I) thoughts are pointed out to be mind, (2.) mind is pointed out to be empty, (3) emptiness is pointed out to be appearance, ( 4) appearances and emptiness are pointed out to be inseparable, (s) inseparability is pointed out to be self-liberated, ( 6) the five poisons are pointed out to be self-liberated, and ( 7) the six collections"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION I 33 of consciousness are pointed out to be self-liberated.70 At the conclusion of this section, both Terdak Lingpa and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche note that this sevenfold set of pointing out instructions is essentially the same as Garap Dorje's well-known Three Statements That Strike the Vital Point.71 The third step presented by these two authors is not found in the root texts of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis. Instead, it seems to be an amal-gam of material found in Longchenpa's Dakini's Quintessence.n This stage as well contains a series of pointing out instructions. In contrast to the previous step, however, these instructions are not philosophical in nature, but more evocative and inspirational. In the first introduction, the natural stillness of mind is pointed out within a state of meditative absorption. This introduction contains a beautiful set of instructions that the guru is instructed to read aloud to the student.73 Next, the natural radiance of awareness is pointed out to be the play of wisdom. This introduction takes place in three steps. First, stillness is pointed out to be the mind's adorn-ment, then movement is pointed out to be the play of the mind, and finally movement and stillness are pointed out to be nondual. As with the first pointing out instruction, these introductions are evocative and experien-tial, rather than theoretical. Following these contemplations and pointing out instructions, both Terdak Lingpa and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche offer general advice on studying and practicing the breakthrough teachings, how to advance in practice, and how to identify the obstacles to meditation and apply their respective antidotes. This general advice, followed by a short colo-phon, concludes the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche's presentation of the Heart Essence teachings. Terdak Lingpa's text continues on with approxi-mately forty pages devoted to the direct leap, four pages to the intermedi-ate states, and three pages to the nirmanakaya pure realms.74 He concludes with a short discusston of the profundity of the Heart Essence teachings and their seal of extreme secrecy. --TEACHING THE HEART ESSENCE --According to Jamgon Kongtriil, there are three ways to impart the instruc-tions of the Heart Essence: (1) as a system of experiential guidance, (2) as a series of pointing out instructions, and (3) as parting advice to someone on the verge of death. Concerning the first, he writes that those who are"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"34 I GREAT PERFECTION more discursive by nature and enthusiastic about experiencing the ordi-nary signs of spiritual progress should first practice the yoga of the four elements to prepare for the pointing out instructions. Those who are dili-gent and inclined towards yogic conduct should begin by practicing the separation of samsara and nirvana. Finally, those who are lazy and inclined towards conceptual analysis should practice the preliminaries of the three gates. Once the practitioner completes the appropriate set of preliminary practices, they may then fruitfully receive the pointing out instructions of the main Heart Essence practices. In the second approach of imparting the teachings, pointing out instruc-tions are given immediately after bestowing empowerments. This approach is appropriate for those who are karmically ripe for the teachings, i.e., those who have undergone extensive training in previous lifetimes or practiced other systems of meditation prior to encountering the Great Perfection. Here, only the breakthrough and direct leap are taught, though various symbolic introductions may be given to supplement the instructions. The third approach, Kongtriil writes, can be likened to giving instruc-tions \"to someone about to set out on a journey.\" This refers to the death process. Since the various stages of death are experienced with resistance by those who are not familiar with them, the Heart Essence teachings may be imparted to a dying person so they may recognize and understand what they are experiencing, and thereby use the death process as a way to liber-_ate themselves.7s Following this discussion of the various ways one may impart the Heart Essence teachings, Kongtriil goes on to explain how those with differing backgrounds and limitations may approach these instructions. The most complete ~pproach involves a style of training referred to as \"~aturing guidance\" ( smin slob), in which the practices and instructions are imparted in their entirety. If this is the case, one begins with the common outer and inner preliminaries, before moving on to a set of yogas that relate to the energies and essences of the subtle body. In the next step, one practices the unique preliminaries of the Heart Essence, and then the various stages of breakthrough meditation. Following this is the separation of samsara and nirvana and the key instructions of the direct leap. Each of these steps, he explains, \"must be practiced until actual experience has taken birth in one's being.\"76 For those who have already trained in a different form of completion stage practice, a more abbreviated approach may be taken. Such individu-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION / 35 als may start with whatever form of the outer preliminaries seems appro-priate, and then move straight into the preliminaries of the three gates and breakthrough practice. For those whose age prohibits them from practic-ing the subtle body yo gas, or who for whatever reason are not able to derive benefit from these practices, it is permissible to simply omit these yogas. Similarly, it is perfectly fine to teach breakthrough alone .to those unfit for the direct leap, such as those with faulty.sense faculties. On the other hand, Kongtriil cautions, it is not permissible to skip over breakthrough and teach the direct leap alone.n --THE EXCELLENT CHARIOT --The teachings contained in this volume build on the instructions found in Great Perfection: Outer and Inner Preliminaries, which contains the first half of The Excellent Chariot, a profound text compiled by the Third Dzog-chen Rinpoche for use at the retreat center of Dzogchen Monastery in eastern Tibet. The first half of The Excellent Chariot deals primarily with the outer and inner preliminaries. The second half, presented in this vol-ume, addresses the unique Heart Essence preliminaries and the main Great Perfection practice of breakthrough meditation. In addition to an exten-sive treatment of these topics, the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche also includes biographies of the lineage masters of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis and general instructions on how to study and practice the Great Perfection. The Excellent Chariot is a compilation of writings from various Great Perfection masters. While the teachings contained in Great Perfection: Outer and Inner Preliminaries were drawn primarily from Longchenpa's Precious Wish-foljilling Treasury and Resting in the Nature of Mind, the main sources for the instructions that follow are the root texts of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, Longchenpa's Quintessence of the Dakinis, and Terdak Lingpa's Illuminating the Profound Path. The biographies included in this work were taken from Longchenpa's Precious History of the Trea-sure. These sources are among the most authoritative works on the Heart Essence in the entire Nyingma lineage. As a final note, these instructions are meant to be studied under the guid-ance of a qualified lineage master. The Great Perfection, moreover, carries a strict seal of secrecy. Its teachings are meant to be studied and practiced"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"36 / GREAT PERFECTION privately, not shared with those who have not received the appropriate transmissions.

With this in mind, please honor the request made by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche in the preceding foreword: Please do not read these teachings unless you have completed the preliminary practices and received pointing out instructions from a qualified lineage master, or have received explicit permission to read this text from such a teacher. --ACKNOWLEDGMENTS --This translation project was carried out at the request of the seventh Dzog-chen Ponlop Rinpoche, without whose guidance, blessings, and support the translation of this profound text would not have been possible. The very first Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, Namkha Osel, was a great mas-ter of the teachings contained in this book. He was also a clear source of inspiration for the author, as evidenced. by the latter's extensive praises of Namkha Osel in the lineage history chapter of this very work. Throughout their successive incarnations, the Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoches continued to uphold the teachings of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis at Dzogchen Monastery in eastern Tibet, working together with the Dzogchen tulkus to ensure that this profound lineage of teachings and realization remained available to future generations in its purest form. It is fitting, then, that the seventh incarnation ofNamkha Osel, the cur-rent Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, is one of the driving forces in transmit-ting these teachings to the West.

Explaining how one should actually do so, the omniscient lord ofDharma, Longchenpa, wrote: Just like a patient relies on the king of doctors, Like subjects rely on their king, and travelers rely on their guides, Like merchants rely on their captain, and passengers rely on a ferryman-To pacify the affiictions and spontaneously manifest the twofold benefit;"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 / GREAT PERFECTION To free oneself from all harm, all wrongdoing, all fear of birth and death; To cross the ocean of existence, one must follow a teacher. These metaphors show us how to follow a teacher. To pacify the sickness of the affiictions, you should act like a patient would towards his or her doc-tor. To protect yourself from the fear of being harmed, act like a subject would towards a king. To free yourself from the fear of birth and death, act as a traveler would towards a guide. To bring about both your own and others' welfare, act as a merchant would towards the captain of his or her ship. Finally, to cross over the ocean of samsara, act as a passenger on a ferry would towards a ferryman. This is how you should follow a guru. In the following passage from Resting in the Nature ofMind, Longchenpa explains the first of these metaphors, following a guru like a patient relies on a doctor: Think of your guru as a doctor, the instructions As medicine, and yourself as a patient. Consider your diligent efforts the medical treatment, With peace and happiness as the resulting cure. The other ways of following can be inferred from this-Follow your guru with these four pure ideas as your guide. The Flower Ornament Sutra explains further: Fortunate child, think of yourself as a patient. Think of the Dharma as your medicine. Think of diligent practice as your medical treatment. Think of your spiritual teacher as a skilled physician. Or, fortunate child, think of yourself as a subject. Think of the Dharma as fearlessness. Think of diligent practice as the total pacification of any harmful forces. Think of your spiritual teacher as a king. Or, fortunate child, think of yourself as a traveler.

The ~y of the Bodhisattva states: Never, even at the cost of your life, Should you forsake your spiritual teacher, Learned in the meaning of the Great Vehicle, And in the bodhisattva's conduct, supreme. [V.Io1] As shown here, you should practice by studying the sacred Dharma and regarding your guru with sincere interest and appreciation. The five topics taught in the first volume comprise ~graded set of prelimi-nary practices that are commonly found in the sutras. These five are: I) the rarity of the freedoms and endowments, 1) the impermanence of life, 3) the principle of karmic causality, 4) the sufferings of samsara, and s) the benefits ofliberation. Having carefully contemplated these five topics, one can then move on to a second set of preliminary practices that are common to both the sutras and tantras. These six are: I) taking refuge, 1) devdoping bodhichitta, 3) maintaining the vows, 4) purifying negativity and obscu-rations through the meditation and recitation ofVajrasattva, s) gathering the accumulations with the mandala offering, and 6) invoking blessings with the practice of guru yoga. Next we have a set of unique preliminary practices that are specific to the Great Perfection of the secret, unsurpassed Heart Essence. This section is divided into two parts: 1) the nature of the student who receives these teachings and setting the stage with conducive circumstances, and 1) how the instructions that are taught should be imparted."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"46 / GREAT PERFECTION THE NATURE OF THE STUDENT --AND CONDUCIVE CIRCUMSTANCES The first of these topics is addressed in all the tantric treatises and manuals of key instructions. The Tantra of Self-arising Awareness summarizes: Strong faith and great diligence, Great intelligence and no attachment, Great reverence and practice of Secret Mantra, No conceptuality and an undistracted mind, With samaya vows and diligence in practice ..• As stated here, there are a number of prerequisites needed by those who receive these teachings. To start, the factors that allow one to receive bless-ings in a rapid manner must be present in their entirety. More specifically, this refers to the four kinds of faith: lucid faith, inspired faith, the faith of conviction, and ultimate faith. Lucid faith creates great delight in the guru and motivates one to practice his or her instructions. With inspired faith, one has an intense interest in the results of practice. With the faith of conviction, one is free from doubt concerning the principle of causal-ity. Finally, ultimate faith is that which cannot be snatched away by fleet-ing circumstances. In addition to these four kinds of faith, one should also have great courage, be dauntless in the pursuit of unsurpassed enlighten-ment, and be diligent. In other words, one should not procrastinate or act inconsistently. With these factors one's commitment will be stable, and experience and realization will arise with ease. One must also be able to eliminate any missteps that may occur. To do so, the dear intelligence associated with analyzing the profound and true nature must be present. Moreover, the tendency to be obsessed with one's present life must be severed by reversing one's clinging and fixation to food, clothing, and the other pleasures of worldly existence. Respect towards the guru and deity should be one-pointed as well. Through this, blessings will be received automatically. One also needs to engage in the profound prac-tice by cutting through any exaggerated or depreciatory doubts one has about the path of Secret Mantra. The mind needs to be stable and undis-tracted. This is brought about by not identifying with attachment, aver-sion, and other ordinary thought patterns. One's vows need to be main-tained, meaning that one must not have failed to keep the main and sub-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE OUTER SEPARATION OF SAMSARA AND NIRVANA / 47 sidiary samaya vows one has received. Finally, dUigence is also necessary; one must not lose heart or get wom out when it comes to meditating on and practicing the true nature. It is said that one who possesses these quali-ties is a fit vessel for this profound path. The following passage from the Tantra of the Clear Expanse addresses the place such a student should practice: Snowy retreats, empty lands, the peaks of mountains, and charnel grounds-Completely isolated places, clear and lofty-Such are the places a fortunate student should practice. As stated here, you should practice in places that are positive by their very nature, with little human activity or noise. Avoid any areas where there is danger of enemies, thieves, or other such factors. Instead, find an environ-ment that has a hospitable climate. Meditative absorption deyelops natu-rally in such places. . Concerping the time one should practice, the same text states: · The times between summer and fall, between winter and spring, And sunrise and sunset-these times are said to be supreme. The reasoning here is that the temperature is moderate at such times. For this reason, the circumstances that lead to states of dullness and torpor are few in number, the wisdom of direct perception can arise with ease, and introduction to the nature of mind is greatly facilitated. Concerning the companions one should practice with, the Tantra of the Clear Expanse states: Those with pure samaya and great pure perception, Who are open-minded and stable, in whom the five poisons are weak, And who are patient and loving companions-these you should befriend.

Your companions should be adept when it comes to pure percep-tion. Likewise, their afHictions should be less intense and they should have a loving mind. If the people you surround yourself with have these quali-ties, there won't be any difficulties in finding conducive circumstances for practice. Explaining the specific practice materials one will need, the Tantra of the Clear Expanse states: Flowers, empowerment offerings, materials for feast gatherings, Torma arrangements, and supports to revive your constitution While engaged in practice-gather all the conducive requisites. As stated here, you should gather together offerings to make to your guru when receiving empowerment, as well as materials needed for the collec-tion of tormas that will be offered to the dak.inis. Food, drink, and other provisions that match your constitution should be collected as well, so long as they have not been involved with any form of negativity.

This teaching self-manifested and was unimpeded like an echo. Everything up to this point constitutes the lineage of realization, in which the victori-ous ones are both teacher and student. Vajrasattva went on to teach Garap Dorje, who then taught Shri Simha. The latter was the teacher of Padmasambhava. These tea_chings, which took place via symbols and symbolic stages, make up the symbolic lineage. Next, Padmasambhava taught Yeshe Tsogyal, which constitutes the oral lineage. The master and his female partner then transferred their blessings to the fortunate master of this teaching, Princess Pemasd, and sealed their transmission with aspirations and empowerments. This constitutes the lineage of aspiration and empowerment. The lineage of the secret words of the Heart Essence was then set down in writing and entrQSted. to the daki-nis and treasure guardians. The teachings were hidden at Tramo Rock and later removed by Perna Ledrd Tsd. This constitutes the lineage of words on yellow parchment. This treasure revealer's work for the benefit of beings was left unfin-ished due to the influence of obstacles. & foretold in the treasure's proph-ecy, however, Perna Ledrd Tsd reincarnated as Longchen Rabjam and was taught directly by the male and female masters, Padmasambhava and Yeshe . Tsogyal. With this, he received the lineage ofprophetic transmission. Hence, these teachings have been passed down through six different lineages. Generalfy speaking, in other classes of tantra found in the Vajrayana the meaning is concealed using vajra words. In contrast, this meaning is taught explicitly in the Seventeen Tantras and the commentaries that elu-cidate their essential meaning. In particular, the style and approach of the Six Essence Tantras That Liberate upon Wearing, the Three Last Testaments of the Buddha, 81 and the key instructions on these teachings composed by the Great One of Oddiyana and his spiritual partner are in harmony insofar as they all teach the innermost realization of the buddhas. This eminent and supreme path, the profound and secret Great Perfection, is what we now know as the Heart Essence of the Dakinis. In this tradi-tion, symbolic representations are used to point out the true, fundamen-tal nature.

Thus, samsara and nirvana must be separated. By their very nature, our ordinary body, speech, and mind are completely pure from the very beginning. Nevertheless, this nature becomes tempo-rarily and adventitiously obscured by our fixation and deluded perception.

Along the way we've experienced the innumerable physical forms, verbal expressions, thought patterns, and types of suffering found in each of the six realms. None of these experiences have done us any good, though, have they? What's the use of continuing to grasp and cling to this never-ending stream of mundane activity? What we need to do now is separate samsara from nirvana and cut the very root of what causes us to continue being reborn in samsara.

The nature of perfect, genuine buddhahood consists of perfect aban-donment and perfect wisdom. The former involves uprooting the afflic-tive and cognitive obscurations on the path, then eliminating them alto-gether immediately upon the attainment of the vajralike concentration.

He then proceeded to gather the accumulations for three incalculable eons, before finally attaining com-plete and perfect buddhahood. To elaborate, the sacred divine son Shveta-ketu first beheld the five visions as he dwelt in Tushita, the Joyous Heaven. Then, placing his crown on the head of Maitreya and appointing him regent, he took the form of an elephant and entered the womb of May-adevi. Ten months later he was born in Lumbini Grove, whereupon he was bathed by the gods. Since his mother passed away seven days after he was born, he was entrusted to Mahaprajapati and the rest of the thirty-two nurses. He then grew up like a lotus in the midst of a vast ocean. Since the king had accomplished all he set out to do, he named the young boy Sid-dhartha, \"the one who accomplishes all goals.\" Yourig Siddhartha dwelt in the palace and manifested the appearance of studying grammar, mathematics, archery, sports, and other subjects. The king then arranged his marriage to sixty thousand brides, including Gopa, the daughter of Dandapani Shakya; Yashodhara, the daughter of Ghantashabda; and Mirgaja, the daughter of Shuklodana. Each of these brides had a retinue of twenty thousand. 84 As he dwelt in the palace enjoying the five sense pleasures, the sound of a cymbal triggered his memory of the prayers he had made in the past and he heard following words: Having seen the hundred sufferings that plague sentient beings, You pledged to become their protector, refuge, and support; To benefit, protect, and defend them.

In these four direc-tions, he witnessed the four rivers ofbfrth, old age, sickness, and death, as well as a mendicant who had entered the path that leads to liberation from these four. He· then said to himself: Aging, sickness, and death-if these three did not exist, I too would continue To delight in pleasurable things. Pondering these sufferings, he developed a firm sense of renunciation. He prostrated to his father, mounted Kanthaka, and ventured into the sky, each of his horse's hooves held aloft by one of the Four Great Kings. He then ordained himself in front of the Stupa of Purity. Next he manifested the appearance of practicing meditation. In Vaish-. ali, he practiced meditation with Aradakalama, training up to the level of nothing whatsoever.85 He then went to Rajagriha, where he studied with Udraka Ramaputra~ this time reaching the peak of existence. 86 After this, he manifested the appearance of practicing asceticism.

For two years, he ate only one grain of rice each year, and after that he drank only one drop of water a year for another two years. Finally, for two years he did not eat or drink anything at all.

With this, he settled into a state of concentration. As he sat in meditation, the demon Mara led an army of hundreds of millions against him, but the bodhisattva was resting in the absorption of love. All the weapons they fired at him .transformed into a rain of flowers, and all of their screams and shouts turned into melodious praises. This subdued the minds of all the demons and turned back the hordes of Mara. Next, Mara's seven daughters came to seduce him with their charms, yet they were transformed into seven old hags.

Thus, there were twelve turnings in all. In the perfect place of Vulture Peak Mountain, he turned the middle wheel of Dharma on the absence of characteristics, whUe in the realm of the nagas and a number of other unspecified places, he gave his final set of teachings, those on the definitive meaning. . In this way, he turned the wheel of the Dharma in such a way that the teachings he gave fit the specific mind-sets of the disciples who received them. Some beings that needed his guidance were established in the bliss of gods and humans. Others were set on the paths of the three vehicles and the principle of causality. The spiritual approach that leads to the bliss of gods and humans is called the Vehicle of the Higher States, referring to the result that ensues once one has practiced the cause of such states-the practice of the ten virtues and the abandonment of the ten forms of vice. As. stated in the Glorious Remainder: Practicing the ten virtues and giving up the ten forms of vice Will cause one to be born as a god or human in the desire realm. The Vehicle ofT rue Goodness is divided into two, the Causal Vehicle of the Perfections and the Fruitional Vehicle, or Secret Mantra Vajra Vehicle.

The Secret Man-tra Vajra Vehicle contains six divisions: Kriya, Upa, and Yoga; and Maha, Anu, and Ati. Together, these are the nine vehicles. THE INNER SEPARATION OF SAMSARA AND NIRVANA --The various vehicle~ taught above are all contained within the Great Perfection, the nature of which transcends the intellect. In fact, these vehi-cles are said to be nothing more than methods for realizing Atiyoga. As stated in the King Who Creates All:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE INNER SEPARATION OF SAMSARA AND NIRVANA I 63 Universally inclusive and subsuming all intents-All are condensed in the natural Great Perfection. This itself is the essence of everything, For within it, there is nothing left out. To access the meaning of what is spoken of here, one must effectively separate samsara from nirvana in an internal manner. This section contains two divisions: .,.. A teaching on the separation of samsara and nirvana .,.. How to separate samsara and nirvana Concerning. the first of these divisions, the Tantra of the Clear Expanse states: To bring the inner source of confusion to an end, Separate samsara from nirvana in an internal manner. The outer separation of samsara and nirvana brings the external circum-stances of confusion to an end. Nevertheless, if the internal sources and seeds of confusion have yet to be exhausted, aversion and the other forms_ of affiicted motivation will continue to plant their respective seeds, which in this case are the habitual patterns associated with vice. As a result, these habitual patterns will eventually become active again along with their potential, and the continuity of samsara's six realms will not be severed. To break through this cycle, samsara and nirvana must also be separated from one another in an internal manner. The second section concerns how to go about actualizing this separa-tion. There are three factors that need to be addressed here: .,.. The object of purification .,.. The process of purification .,.. The signs of successful practice The objects of purification are all the negative karma and habitual ten-dencies that we have accumulated with the negative bodies we've had from time immemorial down to the present. On this point, the Last Tes-tament states:"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"64 I GREAT PERFECTION Since this body is produced by ignorance, The six classes are present as seeds. And: This body comes into existence from ignorance and confusion. Hence the body contains the seeds of the six classes of existence. While the Tantra of the Clear Expanse states: At the crown, throat, heart, navel, Secret place, and soles of the feet Are AH, SU, NRI, TRI, PRE,' and TU. Because the seed syllables of the six realms mentioned here have yet to be purified, we wander continuously throughout the six classes of existence and experience· the suffering of samsara's three worlds. To purify the seeds of this process, as well as the causes that lead our body, speech, and mind into a state of confusion, we need to separate samsara from nirvana. Visualize a white AH syllable ai: your crown as the seed of the gods and their habitual patterns; a gold su syllable in your throat as the seed of the demi-gods and their habitual patterns; a greyish-blue NRI syllable in your heart center as the seed ofhumanitywith all ofits attendant habitual pat-terns; a dark red TRI at your navel, the seed of the animals and their habit-ual patterns; a green PRE syllable in your secret place as the seed of the spirits and their habitual patterns; and smoke-colored TU syllables at the soles of your feet as the seed of the hell beings and their habitual patterns. Visualize all of these clearly and meditate that the entire range of habitual patterning associated with each of these realms is drawn in and dissolves into these syllables. In an impure state, the habitual patterns created by karma and a.fHiction accumulate in these six syllables. Anger and the other factors motivated by aversion accumulate on the syllable TU. Similarly, attachment accumulates on PRE, pride on AH and NRI, envy on su, and stupidity on TRI. In his explanation of the Secret Heart Essence, Vimalamitra writes:88 Through the functioning of the mental consciousness, the fac-tor that causes a rebirth as either a human or god accumulates, respectively, on the AH and NRI syllables. Through the func-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE INNER SEPARATION OF SAMSARA AND NIRVANA I 6s cloning of the universal ground consciousness, the factors that cause birth as either an animal or demi-god accumulate on the TRI and su syllables, respectively. Through the functioning of the five sense consciousnesses and the affiicted consciousness, the factors that cause birth as spirits and hell beings accumulate on the PRE and TU syllables. These factors are present in the mind stream of all sentient beings throughout the six realms. & stated here, the seeds of the affiictions and their habitual patterns, those of the five poisons and greed, are the basis for purification. Second, we have the factors that are generated to purify these-the three syllables of enlightened body, speech, and mind. The Last Testament explains: Since awareness is the true three kayas, The three kayas manifest as three syllables. Master the power of these syllables and make the separation. & indicated here, visualize the syllable of the enlightened body at your crown, a brilliant white OM; in your throat visualize a brilliant red AH, the syllable of enlightened speech; and in your heart center, a brilliant blue HUM, the syllable of enlightened mind. The omniscient lord of Dharma, Lon~chenpa, explains: At the time of realization, the virtues that manifest as the self-display of wisdom amass on the three syllables of enlightened body, speech, and mind. The virtue created by deity meditation and other fahors linked with enlightened body settles on the syllable OM. That of mantra recitation and other related factors settles on the syllable AH, while that associated with noncon-ceptual meditations and the like settles on the syllable HUM. This process purifies the six syllables, which are the basis of the purificatory process, as well as the habitual patterns that rest upon them. While verbally reciting OM AH HUM, visualize the three-colored fire of wisdom blazing forth from the syllables at your three places. This fire com-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"66 I GREAT PERFECTION . pletely incinerates each of the six syllables associated with the six classes of samsaric existence, as well as their attendant habitual patterns, to the point where nothing more remains. It blesses ordinary body, speech, and mind with the enlightened body, speech, and mind of the Victorious ones and floods all the realms of the six classes of existence with light. Visualize that each of these realms, along with its habitual patterns, is incinerated into nothingness and that all the causes and results of samsara and the lower realms, both your own and those of others, are refined away. Imagine that your body then becomes brilliantly clear, like a crystal ball wiped clean. & you visualize all' this, recite OM AH HUM seven hundred thousand times with a beautiful melody. This process uses the syllables of the victorious ones' enlightened body, speech, and mind to refine away the six syllables that are the seeds of the six cla5ses of existence. Once this takes place, you will be freed from the various forms of karma that accompany them, which is associated with the happiness and sUffering of samsara, and all obstacles will be pacified. The third section deals with the various signs and omens that occur once this process has effectively purified negativity and obscurations. Signs that physical impurities have been purified include being cleansed, wearing fresh clothes, and the body transforming, such that it resembles a crystal ball or other such thing. & signs that verbal impurities have been purified, ~any omens may occur. One may hear a c:;onch being blown, for exam-ple, or instruments being played and mantras resounding. One may also become eloquent or develop a great vocal range. Signs that mental impu-rities have been purified include clear senses, finding crystals, jewels, or treasure, and being enthusiastic about virtuous deeds. In brief, the intense fixation associated with ordinary body, speech, and mind will cease and various ·signs that herald the occurrence of wonderful qualities will mani-fest. At best, they will occur manifestly. If not, they will occur as visionary experiences, or at the very least, in the dream state.

It is the supreme companion that illuminates the methods and key instructions. It is the supreme gift when one meets with realized beings.

There are also benefits for those who are teaching the Dharma, for doing so is the supreme offering one can make to the Buddha, as well as the high-est form of generosity towards sentient beings. Teaching causes merit to flourish and brings the attainment of clairvoyant powers. Concerning the first of these, the sutras state: Teaching my Dharma correctly To benefit another is supreme. Flowers, perfumes, and butter lamps Are not true offerings to the Victorious One. Addressing the highest form of generosity, the Maitreya Sinhanadika Sutra states: If one were to completely fill with jewels as many Buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, Then joyfully offer them to the victorious ones, Or give a single verse to another sentient being, The incredibly vast offering of precious jewels Wouldn't equal even a fraction of the generosity Involved in compassionately giving the verse. How could one possibly fathom what happens When two or three verses are given?"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE VAJRA STANCE I 71 In addition, it is also said that the generosity of the Dharma causes merit to flourish and brings the attainment of innumerable clairvoyant powers. The Compendium of Instructions states: The generosity of offering the Dharma is not material. It is what causes virtue to flourish. And in the Sinhanadika Sutra: Through the generosity of offering the Dharma past lives are remembered. While the Sutra Requested by the King oJNagas Sagara explains: Through the generosity of the Dharma, one will come to per-ceive directly the exhaustion of all defilement. There are also innumerable benefits involved in memorizing the teach-ings one has heard. The Sutra Requested by Sagaramati states: Those who memorize the tatagatas' sacred Dharma Will become protectors of the world like Indra and Brahma. They will be universal emperors and rulers of mankind, With happiness, peace of mind, and awakening to enlightenment. --TEACHING THE DHARMA: THE BUDDHAS --There are three different approaches to explaining and listening to the Dharma: the approach of the buddhas, the approach of the foe destroy-ers, and the approach of the scholars. The buddhas turn the wheel of the Dharma using their three miraculous powers. The first of these is the miraculous power of manifesting magical displays. Demonstrating infinite magical feats, such as emanating light, rising seven tree lengths up into the sky, and other such displays, the buddhas instill faith and interest in those who are in need of guidance. This is the miraculous power of enlightened form. With the miraculous power of expression, they clairvoyantly perceive"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72. / GREAT PERFECTION the specific class, mind-set, and latent tendencies of those in need of guid-ance, and then know how to teach the Dharma accordingly. Through this, they are able to bless the mind stream of each member of their retinue. This is the miraculous power of enlightened mind. Once this has made the disciples' mind stream pure and workable, they rain down the Dharma according to the personal interests of their students by means of the miraculous power of fitting instructions. Through these three powers, they link beings with the states of the higher realms and true goodness. As explained in the following passage from the Treasury of Higher Dharma, teaching is the supreme miraculous power. Of the miraculous powers, teaching is supreme Because it is undeluded, fitting, and brings a pleasant result. The rationale for the necessity of these three miraculous powers is that those in need of guidance must be inspired by magical displays, since not having faith renders one an unfit vessel for the Dharma. As written in the Jfay of the Bodhisattva: Do not teach the Dharma to those without respect, To those who wrap their heads with cloth, though not sick; To those with parasols, staffs, or weapons, Or those whose heads are covered. With the power of expression, buddhas understand the individual mind stream of the student and its degree of malleability. This allows them to impart fitting instructions in a manner that matches their particular inter-ests and karmic propensities. If the teachings are not given in this way, they will be of no benefit to the disciple, just as medicine can turn to poison when prescribed to treat the wrong illness. The Jfay of the Bodhisattva states: Those fit for the vast Dharma Should not be linked with the Lesser Vehicle. And in the Rich Array of Ornaments Sutra:"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE VAJRA STANCE I 73 If a practitioner is not ready for such teachings, And is introduced to teachings on emptiness, It wUl be as though nectar had turned to poison. Hence, the teachings of the Great and Lesser Vehides are taught in such a way that they are linked with the different levels of disciples. When taught in this way, teachings are said to be virtuous in the begin-ning, virtuous in the middle, and virtuous in the end; sublime in mean-ing, with sublime words and syllables, and distinct; and also completely perfect, completely pure, and completely refined. To explain, that which is virtuous in the b~ginning, middle, and end is virtuous insofar as dis-cipline, concentration, and knowledge have come together and have not been allowed to degenerate. The sublime meaning is the unmistaken con-tent that is expressed, while sublime words and syllables are the vehicles of expression that allow this meaning to be understood. Distinct means that they are unique and unlike anything else. Completely perfect refers to the fact the Buddha's teachings remedy the entire range of afflictions, and com-pletely pure means they bring liberation from the affiictions that pertain to . one's particular level and that they are of an essentially liberating nature. They are completely refined insofar as they liberate one's mind stream by eliminating the latent tendencies associated with the affiictions at other levels. In the Treasury of Higher Dharma, it is written: The two forms of our Teacher's sacred teachings Have the .nature of scripture and realization. The Buddhist scriptures are referred to as the \"Dharma of scripture,\" while the \"Dharma of realization\" refers to three factors: the path, nirvana, and the basis of supreme merit. That which is realized possesses a twofold purity. It is pure in the sense that the sphere of reality is pure by its very nature, and also in the sense of being liberated from adventitious impurities. That which realizes this is subjective knowledge, which is without appearance. The \"Dharma of realization\" is referred to as such from the perspective of the conventional mind by condensing these two factors; Finally, the \"sacred Dharma\" refers to the highest of all that is free from desire. When it comes to this sacred Dharma, there are innumerable vehicles"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"74 I GREAT PERFECTION and avenues of practice. Nevertheless, the very essence of them all, their true culmination, is the Secret Mantra of the Great Vehicle, the Vajrayana. The Torch of the Three Methods explains: It has the same objective, yet is free of confusion, It is rich in methods, without difficulties, And for those with sharp faculties-From thi¥' perspective, the Mantra Vehicle is superior. In the approach mentioned here, one is guided through the superior path of skillful means, in which enlightenment is attained in a single lifetime. ---THE VAJRA STANCE --There are three preliminary practices associated with the three gates, the first of which pertains to the body. On this practice, the Tantra of Penetrat-ing Sound states: Holding the vajra posture, Train the body and benefit the mind. When the vital points of the body are penetrated, the lucid and impure aspects of the mind are separated from one ariother. To bring about this separation, you must practice the vajra stance. Stand up on a thick cushion with your body straight and the soles of your feet joined together. Dig your toes into the ground and spread your knees out to the sides. With your palms joined, raise your hands over the crown of your head, but without touching it, and spread your elbows outwards. Tuck your chin in to com-press the windpipe and, finally, vigorously tense the muscles of your arms and legs. Your body should be like a three pronged vajra, pointed on the top and pointed on the bottom. Practice this day and night. As for the visualization, imagine yourself to be a blue, three-pronged vajra, blazing with fire. Once your body begins to burn and you cannot maintain the posture any longer, heat will arise and your mind will enter a nonconceptual state. When it does, let your body collapse naturally and then maintain your original state of nonconceptuality."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE VAJRA STANCE I 75 It is important to perform the separation using physical actions. The Great Array explains: One who wishes to perform the separation To turn naturally away from physical activity Should do as was explained above, Performing the outer separation in a genuine manner. Once one has reversed course in this manner, There will be no abiding, and the body Will not become involved with the three realms. The three upper prongs of the vajra stance represent essence, nature, and compassion, while the lower three signify the three kayas. The point at which these two converge in the center symbolizes taking the two prac-tices of breakthrough and direct leap onto the path as being of a single essence. Performing the physical preliminary practice in this way performs three functions: an ordinary function, a specific function, and an ultimate func-tion. Concerning the first of these, this practice purifies every trace of physical negativity. It also serves to pacify all harmful forces and obstacles associated with the body, since such forces will see the body as a vajra blaz-ing with fire. Finally, it reverses whatever clinging one may have towards the body. As to its specific function, by reversing clinging in this manner, one will no longer engage samsara and the body will be liberated into the nirmanakaya. Its ultimate function is to transcend suffering and reach the primordial state, in which one's own body and the vajra body of all the buddhas are inseparable. Keeping these functions in mind, practice this day and night with intense diligence."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN Sealing Appearances and the Aggregates ONCE AGAIN, those of you gathered here should begin by giving rise to precious bodhichitta. Think to yourselves, \"I will bring all sentient beings to the state of perfect buddhahood.

The scriptures state: Having thoroughly gathered your thoughts, Listen with a completely altruistic attitude. Those with forgetful minds will not be blessed By Vajrasattva and the other blissful ones. This approach to receiving teachings with a sense of enthusiasm is also dis-cussed in the Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish, which recounts the tale of King ChUing Karling, who pounded a thousand nails into his own body just to hear a single stanza of the Dharma. Another story tells how King Kanashinasali used his own body to make one thousand butter lamps, again, just to hear a single stanza of the Dharma. As these and other such tales show, some individuals are capable of enduring innumerable hardships to receive teachings. We, in contrast, are able to receive the profound and vast teachings of the Great Vehicle right · now, without having to undergo any hardships at all. How wonderful this is! Even if the teachings are given day and night without interruption, you should receive them with a sense of delight and enthusiasm. As is said, \"The precious Dharma is rare and involves many hardships.\" How incred-ibly rare it is to have the good fortune to listen to and receive teachings on the Dharma, living as we do in a borderland at the end of an era."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"78 I GREAT PERFECTION Even if we have no great understanding of the teachings we receive, just hearing the sound of the Dharma is extremely beneficial. To give one example, long ago a female dog heard the sound of the teachings being given by a monk named Upakute, and this was enough to wear down her obscurations. When she died, she was born as a god in the Heaven of Mastery over Others' Creations. Another story tells of a pigeon that lived nearby a monk. Early each morning, this pigeon heard the monk reciting the Condensed Perfection of Knqwledge. Sometimes day would break when the monk had recited half the text, and sometimes when he had recited two-thirds, at which point the pigeon would fly off. Just hearing the sound of the teachings contained in the sublime Condensed Perfection of Knowl-edge wore down the pigeon's obscurations. No sooner did it die than it was reborn as a human, who then gained faith in the Three Jewels. With this newfound faith, the pigeon, now a man, took ordination. He had only to look at the portions of the text he had heard to understand them, without needing to memorize them. If such great benefits ensue when a mere animal hears the sound of the teachings, then what about we humans? It is said that we are defined by our ability to communicate and understand. For this reason we are suit-able vessels for explaining and receiving teachings and can put them into practice. What wonderfully good fortune! TEACHING THE DHARMA: --THE FoE DESTROYERS --The Dharma is taught in three different ways. The first of these was taught in the previous section and pertains to the buddhas, who teach the Dharma via their three miraculous powers. Next are the foe destroyers, who teach the Dharma via the three purities: the pure vessel, pure speech, and pure content. Respectively, these three refer to the students who are fit to receive the teachings, the teacher who instructs them, and the con-tent that is expressed, i.e., the Buddha's teachings. As a foe destroyer, the teacher first clairvoyandy examines the students to tell if they are fit ves-sels for the Dharma. Those who are fit vessels are then taken on as disci-ples. These disciples listen to the pure speech of their teachers and apply themselves to their speech and words in a fauldess manner. In other words, the pure meaning of the Dharma-the various types of speech that guide"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"SEALING APPEARANCES AND THE AGGREGATES / 79 one to liberation-are imparted in an unmistak.en and undeluded manner, bringing great benefit. At this point, one may wonder why it is that the foe destroyers do not teach via the three miraculous powers. The reason for this is that they are still subject to four factors that impede understanding. The first factor is environmental circumstance. For example, if a given location is simply too far away, a foe destroyer will not be aware of it. This was the case with Maudgalyayana, who did not know where his mother had been reborn. The second factor is temporal circumstance, which refers to the fact that foe destroyers do not know what took place in the extremely distant past. Shariputra, for instance, was unaware that the layman Shrija possessed the seed of liberation. The third factor is the circumstance of characteristics. This includes the fact that foe destroyers are unaware of the infinite range of results that follow from a cause, as well as the infinite range of causes that lead to a particular result. As shown in the sutras: The one who knows the distinct causes Of the pattern of colors on a peacock's tail Is omniscient, for this cannot be known Without the wisdom of omniscience. In addition, there are many teachings of the buddhas that the foe destroyers do not comprehend. Since they do not attain the ten strengths, the fourfold fearlessness, the four correct discriminations, and the other qualities of great enlightenment, they lack the ability to behold the entire range of the Buddha's teachings, including the teachings on buddha nature. Hence, as stated in the Commentary on the Unsurpassed Continuum: In brief, there ate four classes of individuals that are classified as not having the eyes to see buddha nature. These four are worldly beings, listeners, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattvas who have newly entered the Great Vehicle. --SEALING APPEARANCES AND THE AGGREGATES --Generally speaking, the first eight vehicles, from the Listener Vehicle up to and including Anuyoga, are merely paving the way and laying a foundation"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"8o / GREAT PERFECTION for the Atiyoga path. As the true path, Atiyoga is what brings the attain· ment of the actual fruition. In this context, the particular instructions of the Great Perfection Ati-yoga tradition that concern us here are the four verbal preliminary prac-tices. The Tantra ofPenetrating Sound explains: For speech, whUe chanting HUM, Seal, advance your training, develop malleabUity, And take to the road ... There are two further divisions in the first of the practices mentioned here: sealing external appearances and sealing the internal aggregates. SEALING APPEARANCES In an isolated place, seat yourself in the seven-point posture and visualize a blue HUM syllable in your heart center. Once its appearance is vividly dear, leave your lips and teeth barely apart and mingle your subde energies, con-sciousness, and the HUM syllable. Then, as you sing HUM with a beautiful melody in a long, drawn out manner, visualize a stream of HUM syllables emerging from the HUM syllable in your heart and issuing forth from your right nostrU. Imagine these syllables completely saturating the entire range of external appearances, which, as a result, manifest in the nature of HUM. This constitutes the practice of sealing, which functions to liberate appear-ances as lacking true existence. In the Last Testament it is taught that one should practice the vital point of sealing for three days. Hence, though there is a tradition in which the practices of sealing external appearances and sealing the internal aggre-gates are separated from one another and taught in two sessions, here they are addressed together. When practiced, however, they should be prac-ticed separately. One can be practiced in an earlier session and one later, for example, or one can be practiced one day and the other the next.

Next, visualize the interior of your body becoming entirely saturated with these syllables. Recite HUM as many times as you can and then retain the breath. At a certain point, it will seem as though your body has become effort-lessly filled with HUM syllables and you may feel an uncomfortable sensa-tion. This is the decisive factor when it comes to sealing the inner aggre-gates. This practice functions to liberate· the inner flesh and blood aggre-gates into their lack of inherent existence. In the context ofboth the outer and inner process of sealing, you should sing HUM with a beautiful melody and in a long, drawn out manner. Merge the energies, consciousness, and HUM in this way and practice with intense diligence."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN Advanced Training ONCE AGAIN, all of you gathered together and assembled here should be of one mind. Give rise to supreme bodhichitta by thinking to your-selves, \"I will now receive these sacred teachings in the correct manner and put them into practice so that I may bring all sentient beings, both myself and others, to the state of omniscience-unsurpassed buddha-hood!• Having set the stage with this motivation, listen carefully to the teachings. The benefits of listening to and receiving te~gs on the Dharma are too numerous to count, as shown in the following tale: Long ago there was a monk who taught the Dharma. A3 he gave a teaching in an open field one time, a frog nearby heard the sound of his voice. A cowherd named Nanda went to receive the teachings as well, but as he did he absentmindedly crushed the frog under his walking stick. and killed it. Because it had. heard the Dharma before, and because it died with the sound of the Dharma clearly in its ears, the frog was instaridy reborn as a god in the Heaven of the Thirty-three. This, in rum, enabled it to understand three facts: from whence it had come, where it was born, and what karma had propelled it there. Examining these three, it realized that it had been a frog in the past, and that merely hearing the sowid of the Dharma had resulted in its rebirth as a god. With this understanding, it brought many divine flowers to the Buddha and, accompanied by many divine children, prostrated before him. When they arrived, the Buddha said, \"All conditioned things"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"84 I GREAT PERFECTION are impermanent. All phenomena are without a sel£ All that is defiled is suffering. Nirvana is peace.\" Hearing this, the divine child beheld the truth. In this way, just hearing the sound of the Dharma purifies obscurations and lays the foundation for the Dharma in the future. For this very reason, it is important to apply oneself diligently by studying and contemplating over and over again. As stated in the sutras: Through study, one will understand the Dharma. Through study, one will turn away from negativity. Through study, pointless pursuits will be abandoned. Through study, nirvana will be attained. Hence, studying the sacred Dharma without partiality is an extremely important point. --TEACHING THE DHARMA: THE SCHOLARS --As explained above, there are three ways to explain the Dharma. The first two of these, the approaches of the buddhas and foe destroyers, were taught earlier. Next we have the approach of the scholars, which is twofold. The scholars of the glorious Nalanda Monastery explained all of the Buddha's teachings using the five perfections and all the treatises using the five fac-tors for appraising texts. The five perfections are those of place, teacher, teaching, retinue, and time. With the sambhogakaya realms and emanated [ nirmanakaya] places, these are taught to be both thoroughly unconditioned and conditioned. In terms of the thoroughly ·unconditioned sambhogakaya realm that abides in the ground itself, these five are as follows: the perfect place is the Richly Arrayed Supreme Realm; the perfect teacher is glorious Vairochana; the perfect teaching is the Great Vehicle alone; the perfect retinue consists of bodhisattvas who have attained the levels; and the perfect time is the con-tinuous cycle of eternity. There were three turnings of the wheel of Buddhist doctrine in the con-ditioned realms. In the first turning, the perfect place was the Deer Park of Rishipatana, the Grove of the Gift ofFearlessness, which is located outside"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"ADVANCED TRAINING I 8s Varanasi; the perfect teacher was Shakyamuni; the perfect teaching was the four truths; the perfect retinue was the five excellent disciples along with eighty thousand gods; and the perfect time was the period seven weeks after Shakyamuni attained buddhahood. In the middle turning, the perfect place was Vulture Peak Mountain in Rajagriha; the perfect teacher was Shakyamuni; the perfect teaching was made up of the extensive, moderate, and condensed doctrines, which are included in the six classes. The perfect retinue was twofold: the ordi-nary retinue consisted of a great gathering of people, including Shariputra, Maudgalyayana, Subhuti, and the rest of a group of five thousand monks; Prajapati and five hundred nuns; and the householder Anathapindada, the laywoman Vishakha, :ind a great assembly of male and female lay people. The extraordinary retinue consisted of billions upon billionsofbodhisat-tvas, includingBhadrapala, Ratnasambhava, and Susartavaha. The perfect time was a period of eleven years and ten months. In the final turning, the perfect place consisted of the heavens, the naga realm, Rajagriha, Padminagara, and other places; the perfect teacher was, as before, Shakyamuni; the perfect teaching was the teaching on buddha nature and the other divisions of the definitive meaning; the perfect reti-nue consisted of many assemblies, both ordinary and extraordinary; the perfect time was a period of thirty-two years. This explains the distinction between the unconditioned sambhogakaya and conditioned nirmanakaya realms. In this context, the dharmakaya teachers dwell in the realization of the combined thiee kayas, which are beyond meeting and parting. These teachers experience the perfect enjoyment of the nature of the five perfec-tions. For them, the perfect place is the completely pure sphere of real-ity, infinite and uninvolved with any conceptual reference points .. rn this sphere, the perfect teacher Samantabhadra spontaneously enacts the entire range of natural activities. His perfect retinue consists of the perfect enjoy-ment of the apparent aspect of the kayas and wisdoms, which are none other than Samantabhadra himself (and the infinite number of vajra hold~ ers that spontaneously appear out of his display). As the perfect teach-ing, he teaches this retinue the vajra nature of reality itself-the great wis-dom mind of self-occurring luminosity, which has not been conditioned by anyone. The perfect time is the pure witnessing of reality itself, through which the teachings, transcending words and letters, self-occur and self-manifest. The Tantra of the Sole Offspring of All the Buddhas states:"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"86 I GREAT PERFECTION The teachers Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri Spoke this from the natural expanse: Listen retinue, self-expressions of the natural state, This self-occurring wisdom alone Is the sole offspring of all the buddhas. When appraising a treatise, there are five factors that must be taken into account: its author, its scriptural source, the genre to which is belongs, its purpose and intended audience, and a comprehensive summary of its contents. ADVANCED TRAINING -·-WITH APPEARANCES AND THE AGGREGATES The very pinnacle of all the Buddha's teachings, treatises, tantras, and key instructions is the Great Perfection, the teaching of the dharmakaya. Of the instructions on this topic, the first verbal preliminary practice was addressed earlier. The second verbal preliminary practice is advanced train-ing, in which there are two steps: advanced training with external appear-ances and advanced training with the inner aggregates.\" ADVANCED TRAINING WITH APPEARANCES Go to an isolated place and sit upright with your body in the correct pos-ture. Clearly visualize a blue HUM syllable in your heart center and then chant short HUM syllables in a sharp and forceful manner. As you do so, imagine many dark blue HUMs shooting out from the HUM at your heart center one after another. Some of these HUMs should be big and some small, each equal in size to the outer object it is di.r'ected towards. Fierce, violent, sharp, and swift, these powerful syllables bore into all external appearances until they become totally insubstantial. At the conclusion of all this, chant one long HUM and imagine that all these appearancs become completely transparent. Then relax. The sign that you have trained with appearances in this manner is that you will come to feel that while things do appear, they lack inherent exis-tence; that they are evanescent and insubstantial like a rainbow. This is what is meant by \"advanced training with appearances.\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"ADVANCED TRAINING I 87 The function of this practice is as follows. Previously, you have clung to these appearances as though they were real and permanent, not under-standing that they lack inherent existence. This practice will enable you to train, from this point forward, in the fact that appearances lack inherent existence. In doing so, you will be confident when you arrive at the main practice and will not fixate on these appearances as being real. ADVANCED TRAINING WITH THE AGGREGATES The next step is to advance your train~ng with the inner aggregates. Once again, seat yourself in the correct posture. Chanting HUM forcefully, visu-alize HUM syllables with the four characteristics mentioned above-fierce, violent, sharp, and swift-only this time, imagine them piercing your OWn body. Imagine them boring unhindered into your entire body, from front to back and top to bottom, until it becomes evanescent and insubstantial. To conclude, chant one long HUM and imagine your body becoming like a sieve inside and out. Then relax. As a sign that your visualization has hit its mark, your muscles will begin to burn, throb, and ache, and you will have the sense that the body is insub-stantial and evanescent. You will experience the feeling that it lacks inher-ent existence, like the reflection of the moon in water. When this comes to pass, you will be adept in this practice. The function of this practice is as follows. Up to now, your attachment and fixation towards the aggregates have caused you to cling to an \"I,\" a \"self,\" and you haven't recognized that the body has no inherent existence of its own. From this point forward, this practice will elicit the under-standing that the body lacks any such inherent existence. Once you have arrived at the main practice, this will rid you of any clinging towards the \"self,\" regardless of the illness and suffering you may experience physically. By realizing that the self does not exist, you will gain confidence and be free from any fixation or attachment towards the body. Consequently, ill-ness and malevolent forces will not affect you. Ultimately, this practice functions to liberate the aggregates into luminosity, the rainbow body. Hence, you should apply yourself to this practice with intense diligence."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE Malleability and Taking to the Road ONCE AGAIN, listen carefully to the teachings you are about to receive. Listen respectfully, with a one-pointed mind, and without distraction. You should train in receiving teachings as taught in the Great and Lesser Vehicles. On this point, the]ataka Tales states: Study is a lamp that dispels the darkness of ignorance, A supreme jewel that cannot be stolen by a thief or anyone else, And the weapon that conquers all that is thoroughly afHicting. It is the supreme companion that illuminates the methods and key instructions. It is the supreme gift when one meets with realized beings. It will delight those who are learned in the midst of an assembly And overwhelm one's opponents like the light of the sun. The guides will offer praise and the impure will be cleared away. Hardship should be willingly embraced for the sacred Dharma; one should practice with care, diligently, and with great intensity. As written in the Precious Wzsh-.folfilling Treasury: To pacify the afHictions that torment the space of mind, To which we have been accustomed since time immemorial, We must seek the Dharma as Sudhana and Sadaprarudita did-Abandoniltg discouragement and following our spiritual teacher. As explained above, until karma and the afflictions have been done away with, we need to pacify them by following a guru superior to ourselves, the reason being that this is how one must attain superior qualities."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"90 I GREAT PERFECTION The following stories illustrate this approach. In the city Saukhyakara, there lived a boy named Sudhana, the son of an extremely wealthy mer-chant. Sudhana traveled all over the South on a continual quest for the Dharma. In the course of his travels, he studied with 108 gurus. Fifty-four of these gurus, including Manjugosha, gave him prophecies and blessings. After their instructions, there were fifty-four more whom he served.90 The bodhisattva Sadaprarudita91 sold his own flesh when he was seek-ing the Perfection of Knowledge teachings. Setting off in a chariot with the daughter of a merchant and a retinue of five hundred, he traveled east to the city of Ghandavat, where he venerated the bodhisattva Dharmod-gata with offerings. We too need this same type of resolve and diligent exertion. --THE THREE KAYAS AND FIVE PERFECTIONS --The primordial ground precedes all distinctions between samsara and nirvana; it does not fall to any extreme. The objective sphere of reality is pure by its very nature. Like the center of wide-open space, it is empty and accommodat.ing. Like the depths of a dear ocean, it is transparent and unmoving. And like the surface of a polished mirror, it is dear and unob-scured. This true and primordial nature is present as the empty essence, dear nature, and unimpeded radiance of compassion. In this state, the four types of energy, as the life-force of knowledge, act as a mount. These four set compassion-the essence of awareness-into motion, which then manifests externally. From this, an accommodating plane of existence comes about from the essence component. The nature component then causes the appearances of spontaneously present wisdom to arise within this plane of existence. Then, due to the compassion com-ponent, the knowledge that allows one to differentiate objects manifests as the capacity to analyze. In that very instant, all this is understood to be self-manifest. With this understanding, awareness recognizes itself and the primordial ground is self-liberated on its own. This is the fundamental awakening of Samantabhadra. At this time, inner clarity-omniscient wisdom free of all constructed limitations-is present as the nature of an extremely subtle form of self aware wisdom. This wisdom abides within the realm of the dharmakaya, the precious sphere of spontaneous presence. It does not, however, have a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MALLEABILITY AND TAKING TO THE ROAD I 91 face, hands, or any other such distinct features. Rather, it is present merely by virtue of the fact that it neither meets nor parts from the appearances of the nature and compassion that arise from the unimpeded radiance of the basis of manifestation. The perfect teachers at this time are Samahtabhadra and Samantab-hadri. Samantabhadra is the king of self-knowing awareness. Samantab-hadri, as reality itself, is the wisdom of equality, the nature of which does not change or fluctuate with the four times. In the great fortress of reality itself. the realm of the youthful vase body, dwells their retinue-the assem-bled ocean of wisdom-which is inseparable from them and their very embodiment. Within a state free of fluctuation and change, the uncre-ated, precious teachings of enlightened body, speech, and mind are pres-ent there as well, without moving, occurring, abiding, being received, cast away, or changing. In this way, the dharmakaya self-manifests as a realm of luminosity within the primordial ground, enacting the perfection of the entire range of the appearances of the three kayas-this is the true nature of the peace-ful dharmakaya. Since the dharmakaya itself transcends any objective agent or act, it is not restricted by its own displays or representations. Both the environments where beings live and the teachers who appear manifest from the sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. We will now address the way in which this occurs. The vast sambhogakaya appears out of the display of the apparent aspect of the profound sambhogakaya. This takes place via the five perfections. The perfect place in this context is the Completely Pure Richly Arrayed Realm. The perfect teacher is the Great Glacial Lake Vairochana, who holds a precious wheel as a symbol of his supreme enlightenment. From the empty spaces in this wheel comes the stalk of a great lotus. Upon its stamen and center are twenty-five third-order thousandfold universes, located one on top of the other. In the thirteenth universe that sits in the central core of these twenty-five is a universe known as Endurance. The base and center of this universe are ornamented with flowers, and it consists of a beautiful arrangement of one billion worlds, each with four continents and Mount Meru. All of these universes are stacked one above the other like a pile of cloth and nes-tled together like domes of silk. Each is ornamented with the incalculable manifestations of the five perfection~, those of teacher, teaching, retinue, Dharma, and time. Beneath the crossed legs of Vairochana are sixteen great pure realms,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"92. / GREAT PERFECTION stacked one upon another like jewded umbrellas and nestled together like an immeasurably gigantic heap of rice. These realms are adorned with the Dharma and teachers that tame by whatever means necessary. From each of his pores, streams of scented water pour down and form glacial lakes. From these lakes come universes that are ornamented by innumer-able shapes and forms of the Great Glacial Lake. Within each of these dwells another Great Glacial Lake, from which more universes with forms of the Great Glacial Lake manifest just as before, and so on. Hence, universes and teachers manifest and fill all of space, appearing for the sole purpose of ~ing the sentient beings that pervade all of space in just the same way. In the same manner, Vajra Akshobya dwdls in the east, Ratnasamb-hava in the south, Amitabha in the west, and Amoghasiddhi in the north, each with his own symbolic implement: the vajra, jewd, lotus, and crossed vajra. As before, stalks of lotuses emanate out of the empty spaces in the symbolic implements hdd by each of these Buddhas, upon which manifest the Universe Adorned With Vajras, [the Universe Adorned with Jewels,] the Universe of Piled Lotuses, and the Universe of Sublime Activity, each of which has its own twenty-five buddha realms as before. Hence, the entire extent of space is completely pervaded by the realms of sentient beings. The tatagatas, in turn, pervade these realms and are present as the teachers who tame beings by whatever means necessary, as well as their retinues, teachings, and so forth. The time span of all of this is one Great Eon ofMahabrahma. All this is spontaneously present as one great domain of influence of the fundamental awakening of the glorious Samantabhadra. It remains until all sentient beings have been liberated from samsara. During this great eon, the eternal whed of the adornments of enlight-ened body, speech, and mind emanate various forms within this universe, including the forms of Buddhas who tame beings by whatever means nec-essary, the Dharma, the Sangha, sages, priests, Brahma, Indra, and so on. These natural and automatic activities empty samsara. This is referred to as the \"Universe That Depends upon Mahabrahma,\" in which the completely pure teacher that tames beings works continuously for their benefit. In the places where these universes and teachers are found, sentient beings are tamed by the three vehicles. However, in the end, they are brought to the Vehicle of the Vajra Essence. When every sentient being has attained buddhahood and not a single one remains, the works of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"MALLEABILITY AND TAKING TO THE ROAD I 93 Samantabhadra will have reached their culmination. This is referred to as the \"Great Empty Eon ofMahabrahma.\" The teachings that are given by the Great Glacial Lake Buddhas of the five families are the great self occurring letters. They are not compiled by anyone; they appear on their own. This is the unceasing sound of the Mahayana drum. The perfect time is the immutability of reality itself The perfect retinue consists of the inconceivable buddhas of the five families. All of the Great Glacial Lake teachers that dwell within the Completely Pure Richly Arrayed Realm during the Eon of Great Brahma are present as the essence of thirty-six enlightened acts.921hese do not occur in any objectively graspable manner. Rather, they should be understood to be mere components of enlightened wisdom. The victorious nirmanakaya appears from the sambhogakaya. The ana-lytic capacity of self-occurring wisdom is directed outwards, from which glorious Vajrasattva, the master of all the peaceful and wrathful buddhas, self-manifests to tame beings. This is the spontaneous presence of the per-fect teacher. The perfect teaching is the realization of the luminous great perfection. The perfect retinue includes Vajrapani and· the other emana-tions that manifest from its natural compassion to tame beings. The per-fect time is that of the great natural and nondual appearance. The perfect place is the Richly Arrayed Realm ofWisdom, where the teacher teaches in the form of a series of elegant verses. Having given this general presentation of the manner in which the three kayas manifest and the nature of the five perfections,. we will now con-tinue with the instructions of the Great Perfection. These teachings, the supreme and swift path of the Secret Mantra Vajra Vehicle, constitute the very essence of the sacred Dharma that is taught by the teachers of the three kayas. --MALLEABILITY --To begin, place a long stick or some other suitable object in front of you as a support for the visualization that follows.

At the same time, visualize an unbroken chain of HUMs issuing forth from the HUM in your heart center. Starting at its base, imagine them gradually winding their way up the meditation sup-port, coiling around it like thread on a spool. Once they arrive at the top,· fix your mind there and relax for a moment. This will elicit a vivid state of mind. Next, continue to recite HUM, but this time gradually unravel and retract the chain of HUM syllables. Gather them in and visualize them dis-solving into the HUM in your heart center, then relax again. Alternatively, you can visualize it coiling around other things in the same manner and then unraveling. You can do this with mountains and other high places, the trees and dwellings at the peak of such places, trees, and so on. You can also visualize a tall HUM syllable in front of you and then imagine the chain of HUMs coiling around it and unraveling as before. At the conclu-sion of this process, leave your consciousness to itself, relax your mind for a moment. and simply rest. As a sign of successful practice, fixation towards the ordinary body, speech, and mind will naturally reverse course, which will lead to a state that transcends concepts and words. The function of this practice is as fol-lows. In this practice, the energies, mind, and HUM are merged together and one then trains by going and returning. This, in turn, allo~s one to control awareness, which was not possible prior to this point. In the con-text of the main practice, one will then have the ability to transform one's awareness into anything at all. ---TAKING TO THE RoAD*--Sit in the correct posture as before and unify the body, energies, and mind.

After that, return back, rest in your original condition, and relax once again. Next, focus your mind on traveling to and returning from all the riv-ers, mountains, and other places you've been. You can also journey to extremely distant locales in the form of the HUM syllable. Setting off all by yourself, go to places with meandering rivers, forests crowded with trees and boulders,. bathing pools at the sides of rivers, meadows, thickets, areas filled with various flowers and other such.things, and places where differ-ent types of birds and animals live. At times, just relax in places with riv-ers, flowers, and so on, focusing on the visualization and singing HUM in a melodious, drawn out fashion. By practicing in this manner, a heartfelt feeling of weariness with sam-sara will arise from deep within, a nonconceptual concentration on reality itself will take birth in your mind stream, and the mind will experience a deep sense of well-being. This, in tum, will enable awareness to reach its full expression. Practicing the verbal preliminaries in this way serves two functions, one ordinary and one supreme.

These guides of ours are emanations of the Victorious One, Appearing as they do in these degenerate times.

As these passages demonstrate, excellent qualities come from following a spiritual teacher. On this point, the Sutra Requested by Ratnacuda states: Devaputra, when you follow and venerate a spiritual teacher everything will be seen as a pure buddha realm, the sacred con-centration of great compassion will be attained, you will never be apart from the perfection of knowledge, sentient beings will be thoroughly matured, and everything you hope for will be perfectly attained.

Their daughter, a fully ordained nun named Sudharma, lived one league to the west, where she had a small dwelling on an island of golden sand located in the midst of the ocean. One night, Sudharma dreamt that she was visited by a white, crystal man. In her dream, the man gave her an empowerment by placing a nectar-filled vase on the crown of her head. In that instant, she beheld the entire three-thousandfold universe with brilliant clarity. She related what hap-pened to her female servant, who responded by telling her it was a clearly an omen that a child of the buddhas was to be born. Nine months and ten days later, a baby boy was born from between the ribs on the right side of her body; he was adorned with all the marks and signs ofbuddhahood. Sudharma exclaimed: Who else could this child be but a demon? The gods and demi-gods take on various forms. Yet still, no one has ever seen an incident such as this! This will bring the slander of evil beings, how terrible! With these words, she cast her child into a pit of ashes. Celestial deities then fetched and bathed his enlightened form, proclaiming: Great protector, victorious and transcendent, Protector of the universe who illuminates the true nature, Take us under your protection. Celestial vajra, this we now pray! As they uttered auspicious prayers, dakinis gathered together clouds of offerings, while gods, nagas, spirits, and other beings offered gifts of san-dalwood and saffron. The guardians of the world beat their great drums, blew their conches, and hoisted victory banners and pennants. The kings of sages as well gathered together douds of various medicinal substances and incense. Seeing all this, Sudharma returned to fetch the boy and begged his for-giveness, bathing him with perfumed water and milk.

He asked his mother for permission to go and discuss the Dharma with Bud-dhist scholars. She consented, and he then went before King Uparaja and asked to meet with the scholars. The boy went to discuss matters with the scholars, and together they came to a mutual and definitive understand-ing concerning all the Buddhist and non-Buddhist religious doctrines. The scholars prostrated to the boy and placed his feet on the crowns of their heads, naming him \"great master Prabhava.\" The king was extremely pleased as well and offered him the name \"great master Garap Dorje,\" \"the Vajra of Supreme Delight.\" Since he had been cast into a pit of ashes by his mother but did not pass away, he also came to be known as \"great mas-ter Ash-colored Zombie.\" The local people named him as well. Expressing their wonder at the fact that he had been left for dead by his mother but had not died, they called him \"great master Joyful Zombie.\" He then ventured to Mount Suryaprakasha in the north, where he stayed for thirty-two years demonstrating how to remain in a state of con-centration. At this time, he dwelt in the Supreme Realm and requested the entire range of empowerments for the natural Great Perfection, along with the most secret, unsurpassed instructions, from glorious Vajrasattva. This caused a rain of flowers to fall on the mountain where his body was. A voice was then heard to proclaim, \"The teachings of the non-Buddhists are now in decline.\" Hearing what had happened, a non-Buddhist king nearby began to i\"nquire in all the towns as to what had caused these events. A cowherd told him, \"At the base of a nearby mountain there is a sage resting in meditation with a rain of flowers falling all around him. Even if you blow a horn in his ear he doesn't wake up. It must be him!\" The king then ordered assassins to kill Garap Dorje, but when they arrived in his presence they were paralyzed. As the master arose from his meditative absorption, a path appeared that led up into the douds and he left. Seeing this, everyone, the king and his retinue included, begged his forgiveness. They then cast aside their misguided beliefs and converted to the Buddhist faith. Garap Dorje's enlightened mind contained the collected teachings of all the buddhas of the past, and in particular, the 6,4oo,ooo verses of the natural Great Perfection.

Garap Dorje then ventured to the northeast of the Vajra Seat, where there was a great charnel ground named \"Cool Grove.\" This charnel ground was filled with various types of worldly and karmically produced dakinis, and other unruly beings. There was a five-tiered golden stupa there as well, where the sound of bells could be heard. It was in the center of this place, where there was a lake of purifying water, that the great master stayed and meditated. --THE LIBERATION OF SHRI SIMHA --At the same time, a boy named Shri Simha was born in the Chinese town Shokyam Nakpo to the householder Geyden Zangpo and his wife, Nang-sel Denma. When he was fifteen, the boy studied grammar, logic and epistemology, astrology, and the rest of the five sciences with the master Hastibhala. He became extremely learned. One day, as he was traveling to Suvarnadvipa, the noble Avalokiteshvara appeared in the middle of the sky and made the following prophecy: Fortunate one! If you truly wish to attain the fruition in a single life, you must go to the great Cool Grove Charnel Ground. With these words, the bodhisattva vanished. Shri Simha made up his mind to study the meaning of the outer and inner tantras for a period of seven years in order to realize the fruition of the Secret Mantra swiftly. With this resolve, he went to the east side of the Five-peaked Mountain95 and trained under the outcaste Bhelakirti. With this master, he studied the entire range of tantras, transmissions, and key instructions of the outer and inner mantras. One morning, as he was bathing himself in a pond, the Great Compas-sionate One appeared again and made the same prophecy, before vanish-ing. Shri Simha thought to himself, \"It is extremely difficult to travel to India, so I should first practice swift footedness!\" After practicing for three years, he was able to use the miraculous power of swift footedness to travel a cubit off the ground.

Putting them into practice, he attained a body of light, like the reflection of the moon in water, and obtained the supreme spiritual accomplishment. At the time, the dakinis that lived in the charnel ground and the great lanka demons that protected the area each offered him the essence of their life-force, vowed to protect the teachings, and gathered together a great mass of offerings that surpassed the imagination, including parasols, victory banners, and flags."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE MENTAL PRELIMINARIES / 103 The great master Shri Simha then traveled thirteen yojanas96 to the northwest to the great Wild Jungle Charnel Ground, a place where vio-lent winds blew during the day and fires blazed by night.

At the same time that S.hri Simha was living there, practicing yogic discipline and teaching the Dharma to daki-nis, the master Padmasambhava of Oddiyana arrived there miraculously, as had been prophesied by Vajravarahi.97 He proceeded to prostrate and circumambulate Shri Simha, whereupon he asked to be accepted as the latter's student. The master consented and taught him all the various cycles of the Mind, Space, and Key Instruction Classes, such as the Tantra of the Great Perfection Equal to Space. The key points of all these teachings were codified in the Heart Essence of the Dakinis and later passed on to Lady Tsogyal ofKarchen. --SEARCHING FOR THE MIND --Concerning these unique instructions, we have now arrived at the three-fold mental preliminary practice. On this topic, the Tantra of Penetrating Sound explains: Where does the mind come from? Where does it stay? Where does it go? If these three questions are investigated, The mind will be trained and its true nature understood. To start, investigate the mind's point of origin. The factor that we refer to as \"awareness\" and \"mind\" is in constant motion like the wind; it is this \"mind\" that experiences all forms of happiness and suffering. Where does this shifting awareness first come from? Does the mind come into being from a point of existence or nonexistence? Does it arise from appearances or from emptiness? Does it originate from the external universe or the beings that inhabit it? You may wonder whether or not the mind arises from some particular thing made up of the four external elements. If you look for such a thing, however, you will find that you can break everything down into tiny par-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 I GREAT PERFECTION tides. In the end, you won't find anything. You may then get the idea that it arises from inside your own body. Search through each part of your body, through your head and each of your limbs. Can you find it anywhere? On the other hand, if you think that it arises from a state of emptiness, can you find some place that it arises from? Yet if it comes into existence from appearances, what do you actually observe? In short, investigate the mind that you are s~arching for and then turn your attention back to the mind that is doing the searching. You will then behold the mind in its' original state, and see that it has no identifiable essence at all. Until this has actu-ally come to pass, you should repeat this process of examination over and over again. Second, investigate the mind's presence. In this very moment, is the essence of this aware consciousness present in the external universe or in the beings that inhabit it? What pari: of the body is it in? And if not there, where dse might it be? What shape, color, function, and essence indicate its presence? · · Once you have examined and investigated in this manner, and deter-mined that it does not exist in any location whatsoever, turn your atten-tion back to the consciousness that is conducting the investigation. Con-tinue with this process until you have determined that consciousness lacks inherent existence and has no basis or root, while it nevertheless knows and perceives. Third, look into the mind's departure. Like the wind, this mindful aware-ness seems to suddenly arise and then departs just as abruptly. Where does it go? Does it end up in the external universe or in the beings that inhabit it? Does it end up in appearances or emptiness, existence or nonexistence, or in some other condition? When you investigate this matter, you will see that there is no place to which the mind goes. Likewise, the subjective mind itself cannot be identified either. It has no essence that one can point to and say, \"This is it!\" Hence, there is no place where the mind goes, nor is there a mind that goes somewhere. As before, continue this process until you have determined that empty awareness neither comes nor goes.

In an ordinary sense, it func-tions to reverse any intense clinging one may have to the ordinary mind, as well as to purify mental negativity arid pacify obstacles.

It is also explained that there are two divisions here, in which case the first two functions just mentioned are considered the ordinary and the latter supreme. The Tantra of Penetrating Sound explains: The two functions served here can be understood By the divisions of the ordinary and supreme.

His teachings. came to be known as the profound Heart Essence ofPadma, or Perna Nyingtik.

King Indrabhuti lived there with his xo8 queens, surrounded by his major and minor ministers. Because he had no heir, the king made offerings to the three jewels on the fifteenth day of summer one year. He chanted the Cloud ofDharma Sutra, erected an almshouse, and commenced a series of great acts of generosity to the masses. Many years passed in this manner and his treasuries eventually grew depleted, yet the stream of beggars did not cease. The people he had appointed to work there said to them, \"The treasuries are now completely empty, we have nothing left to give you!\" But the beggars who had just come there retorted, \"If you don't give us anything, all that you have given in the past will have been in vain!\" When the king heard this, he inquired as to how he could keep the treasuries from running out. In response, he was told of a beautiful naga maiden who lived on an island in the outer ocean. This maiden was said to have a wish-fulfilling jewel, which she would give away if a bodhisattva with compassion towards sentient beings asked her for it. The king discussed the idea of making such a trip with a captain who had ventured into the outer oceans in search of jewels many times in the past. His ministers begged him not to go, but he would not be dissuaded. With five hundred merchants as his retinue, he boarded a ship and set off. After a few days had passed, they arrived at a treasure isle with sands composed of precious gems. Leaving their retinue behind, the king and captain boarded a smaller boat and set off again. They traveled a few more days, passing mountains of silver, vaidurya, and other places along the way. Once they reached a golden .one, the king asked what it was. \"It is the golden mountain,\" the captain replied, \"that's where we're headed.\" They arrived at the base of the mountain where the ground was filled with golden sands.

Just as the captain predicted, a beautiful blue naga maiden arrived. She was extremely attractive, so much so that one could never get enough of looking at her. She offered the king the jewel from the crown of her head, which he accepted and quickly returned. He then left with the captain and returned back to the isle where the retinue had been left behind. With the captain at the helm, they set off for home. After some time they came to an island in the middle of the ocean. There, sitting upon a beautiful lotus flower, they found a young boy, adorned with all the marks and signs ofbuddhahood. C9ming before him, the king said, \"Little boy, who are your parents and what is your caste? What is your name and from whence do you come? What do you eat and why are you here?\" To which the little boy replied: My father is Samantabhadra, self-awareness, And my mother, Samantabhadri, the sphere of reality itsel£ My caste is the indivisibility of this sphere and awareness, And my name is Padmasambhava, the glorious Lotus-born.

When the boy consented, he cut the lotus at the stalk, took the boy and the precious jewel, and returned to the land of Oddiyana along with his retinue.

Whomsoever may come and get what they desire!\" The jewel was then placed atop a victory banner. After making offerings to it, the king bathed and prostrated before the jewel. Joining his palms together, he said, \"If the jewel that I have found is genuine, may a shower of whatever sentient beings desire rain down!\" With this, wind blew from the four directions and swept away all that was unclean throughout the surrounding land. A fine rain fell as well, ensuring that no dust would arise. After this, first a shower. of delicious food rained down, then clothing, and finally a rain of jewels fell ... every-one received exactly what they desired. Through this, poverty and destitu-tion disappeared from the land. The master, however, understood that the welfare of beings would not be served if he were to take control of the kingdom. To ensure that he fell from the graces of the king and his ministers, he began consciously acting in an unconventional manner. One day, he let a trident slip from his hand. It struck. the head of the son of one of the king's most important ministers, and the boy died as a result. Since whoever broke the laws of the kingdom had to be punished, the ministers who were in charge of upholding the law assembled and said to the king, \"Your majesty, though your son has been enthroned as a prince, he has killed the son of a minister, though this boy had done him no harm. He must be executed by impalement.\" The king did his best to change their minds, but they wouldn't listen. \"Well then,\" he said, \"we must banish him; and the ministers consented. With a heavy heart, the king told the master: On a lotus flower in the midst of a jewel-filled ocean, You spontaneously appeared, a nirmanakaya emanation with no parents.

With these words, he prostrated and left. He traveled to the south of Oddiyana, where he stayed in the Cool Grove, a great charnel ground filled with spirits and wild beasts.

As a support for these transmissions, he also taught him each and every one of the Eighteen Tan-tras,98 including the Tantra of Penetrating Sound. For twenty-five years he dwelt there, studying, contemplating, and meditating on the instructions he received. Next he practiced for three years in the great charnel ground of Sosal-ing. There he did away with birth and death and attained a form like the reflection of the moon in water, which allowed him to benefit a great num-ber of beings, human and nonhuman alike, with a variety of miraculous feats.

It was at this time that King Trisong Deutsen, who protected his land according to the Dharma, invited him to Tibet. There he taught the sacred Dharma's instructions on a vast scale. It was in this context that he gave these teaching cycles on the utmost secret Great Perfection. --RESTING IN THE NATURAL STATE --The teaching that concerns us here is resting in the natural state, which contains two divisions. The first covers the main practice of resting in the natural state, and the second addresses the process of revitalization. The main practice of resting in the natural state contains two further divisions: the purpose of resting in the natural state and the way to do so. Concerning the first, the Clear Expanse states: Disturbances in the body, speech, mind, and elements Are released by resting in the natural state. As stated here, once you've become worn out by practicing the physical, verbal, and mental preliminaries that were taught earlier, you should rest. The siddha Kotalipa explains: Let this weary traveler, the mind itself, Rest in a state free of elaborations-The great seal: fresh, innate, Natural, and uneontrived. At this point, you do not need to involve yourself in anything that dis-turbs the constitution of the energetic channels and elements, and which thereby creates stress in the body, speech, and mind, or with the virtuous practices that are ordinarily considered appropriate. Instead, relax and let the three gates rest in their natural state. The Last Testament explains: Next, become adept in resting in the natural state Physically, verbally, and with the mind."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"n6 / GREAT PERFECTION At this point, you should meditate by focusing your mind one-pointedly on whatever manifests, regardless of whether it is a samsaric thought that would ordinarily be eliminated or a virtuous thought that would function as a remedy. This will bring about a fundamental transformation of these thoughts, turning the conceptual into the nonconceptual, just as murky water becomes dear all on its own when left untouched. If you forcibly block your thoughts, not only will it make your mind restless, it will hinder a state of concentration &om arising. It was with this understanding that the following passage &om the Ornament of the Sutras was taught: Why? Because correctly engaging attachment And other such factors themselves Brings complete liberation. Therefore, Doing so brings complete emergence &om them. The Two Segments teaches a similar skillful approach: As attachment is what binds one to the world, Attachment itself will bring liberation. And from Distinguishing the Middle ftom Extremes: Based on observation, Nonobservation takes place. And based on nonobservation, Nonobservation occurs. Therefore, observation is established To be by its very nature unobservable. Hence observation and nonobservation Must be understood to be equal. 99 The separations of samsara and nirvana and the other practices taught earlier address the coarse fixation-based perceptions associated with the ordinary appearances, habitual tendencies, and so forth that arise so read-Uy in the mind. Next, the inner separation, sealing, advanced training, and other practices are used to rein in the more subtle elements. This, in turn, keeps the sense consciousnesses from being distracted elsewhere, at which point the mental consciousness merees with the JOiY cnJI,.rrinnc: nt rnn-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"RESTING IN THE NATURAL STATE I 1I7 sciousness and the mind's tendency to radiate out to other objects is put to rest. In the next step, the conceptual mind is not directed towards the six objects that serve as focal points or the unconditioned phenomena associ-ated with them. Rather, one just settles in the natural state, without form-ing any concepts concerning appearance and emptiness, certain things that need to be eliminated, the remedies that eliminate them, or anything else. \"Natural state,\" here, means uncontrived, while \"resting\" denotes simply letting be in this state, hence the term \"resting in the natural state.\" Explaining the actual practice of resting in the natural state, the Tantra of Penetrating Sound explains: At this time, the key point of body, speech, and mind Is for the practitioner to settle in the natural state. To explain, begin by seating yourself on a comfortable cushion in either the cross-legged posture of the bodhisattvas or in a squatting position, whichever you prefer. Just let your body be; remain motionless, relaxed, and at ease. Let your breath flow naturally in a relaxed manner and do not talk or say anything, neither good or bad. Without busying yourself with recitations, chanting, and other verbal activities, keep silent and don't alter your breathing. Do not identify with any non virtuous or neutral thoughts. of the past, present, or future. You can even let go of thoughts that are nor-mally considered virtuous. Just let be. This will bring about a state of basic lucid~ty in the three gates, just like water left untouched clearing up all on its own. This is a wonderful way to bring about meditative concentration and tranquility. The signs of progres!t in this practice are as follows. When you are physi-cally resting in the natural state, you will have no desire to move; when you are verbally resting in the natural state, you will not want to speak; and by letting your mind rest in the natural state, all forms of discursive thinking will be purified on their own and vanish. Until these signs actu-ally occur, persevere -in this practice. On this topic, the Perfection ofKnowl-edge·states: Engaging in the yogic practice of the perfection of knowledge is to engage in the yogic practice of space."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"JI8 I GREAT PERFECTION Concerning the benefits of rtsting in the natural state, the Clear Expanse states: For whoever rests in the natural state like this, Disturbances in the elements will be pacified, As will circumstances that lead to illness, And fixation will be self-liberated. As stated here, resting in the natural state physically, verbally, and men-tally serves both temporal and ultimate functions. On a temporal level, one will rest in the natural state physically, verbally, and mentally, and the elements will remain undisturbed. This, in turn, will ensure that circum-stances leading to illness do not occur and that one will rest naturally in a state of meditative concentration. This practice also performs the function ot letting the aggregates, elements, and sense fields rest in their original condition, which allows bodhichitta to develop. By verbally resting in the natural state, the words used to communicate will be self-purified and the nature that defies description will dawn in one's mind stream. By letting one's mind rest in the natural state, all thoughts will be liberated on their own and one will be able to settle naturally into the natural Great Perfec-tion, a state that transcends thought and expression. The ultimate, supreme function of this practice is to bring about the self-purification of clinging related to ordinary body, speech, and mind. To elaborate, by physically resting in the natural state, one will connect with the nirmanakaya. By verbally resting in the natural state, one will connect with the sambhogakaya. And by letting the mind rest in the natural state, one will connect with the dharmakaya. Hence, since body, speech, and mind are indivisible, they neither meet nor part from the three kayas. This is addressed in the Last Testament, where it is written: Fortunate son, you will connect with the nirmanakaya by physi-cally relaxing, you will connect with the sambhogakaya by ver-bally relaxing, and you will connect with the dharmakaya by let-ting your mind relax. The problems associated with failing to rest in the natural state are the opposite of all the excellent qualities just mentioned. You should persevere in this practice until the signs of progress have actually manifested."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN Revitalization ONCE AGAIN, prepare yourself for the teachings by giving rise to supreme bodhichitta. Think to yourself, \"I will bring all sentient beings to the state of liberation and omniscience-unsurpassed, genuine, and perf~ct bud-dhahood. To this end, I will listen to these instructions on the Secret Man-tra Vajra Vehicle and put them into practice in the right way!\" Listen care-fully with this motivation. In the Chronicles, it is written: With your eyes, look at the mouth of the one who teaches the Dharma. With your ears, listen without distraction to what is taught. With your mind, memorize the words and examine their meaning. As taught here, you should practice remaining undistracted with your three gates, while at the same time listening with a sense of enthusiasm and keen interest. THE COMING OF BUDDHISM TO TIBET --AND THE HEART ESSENCE TEACHINGS--I will now say a bit about how the Dharma came to Tibet, elaborating upon the account given in History of the Heart Essence. The snowy land of Tibet was blessed as a realm to be tamed by Mahakaruna. The people and regions of this land came into existence through the coupling of a bodhisattva monkey who was an emanation of the Realized One and a crag demoness who was an emanation ofTara."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"12.0 / GREAT PERFECTION The succession ofTibetan rulers consisted of a line of celestial kings that originally came from India, another land that had been blessed by Avaloki-teshvara. The first king was Nyatri Tsenpo. Succeeding him were the Seven Kings of the Sky called Tri, the Six Kings of the Earth called Lek, the Seven Silmas, and the Five Linking Kings called Tsen. During the reign of King Totori Nyentsen, Tibet's karmic connection with the Buddhist teachings became manifest. As the king dwelt at the fortress ofYuinbu Lagang, the Eighteen Tantras rained down upon the roof of the Indian King Ja. At the same time, due to the blessings of Mahakaruna, Tibet's share of the Dharma appeared at the palace just as the sun began to rise. Accompanied by wonderful omens, a rainbow dome, and a shower of flowers, the Sutra Designed Like a Chest, the Hundredfold Homage for Mending Breaches, and a mould of the Cintamani Mantra appeared. At the time, Tibet had yet to develop an alphabet and had no tradition of virtuous practice, so the meaning of the texts was not understood. A prophecy was received, however, that foretold their being understood after five dynastic succes-sions. The king named these teachings the \"Secret Remedy\"100 and treated them with great respect. This was the beginning of the sacred Dharma in Tibet.101 After five generations, Lokeshvara102 manifested as King Songtsen Gampo. Understanding the meaning of the teachings that had arrived in Tibet centuries earlier, this king had some of the Indian sutras and tantras translated and established a tradition of practicing the ten virtues. Four generations later, King Tride Tsukden and Queen Kyimshing Kongjo ruled the land. One day, as the king and queen slept upon their jeweled bed, the queen dreamt that a baby boy manifested from the Five-peaked Mountain in China, like the appearance of the srin's light, and entered her womb. She explained all this to the king, who then asked a great mystic about the significance of the dream. \"This is a great omen,\" the mystic responded, \"you have conceived a son who is the manifestation of the bodhisattva Manjushri. You must perform a great ritual!\" . Nine months and ten days later, on the day of the constellation Push-yami in the first month of spring in the Year of the Horse, the prince was born. A great feast was held in honor of his birth, and the boy grew up like a lotus in the midst of a vast ocean. When the time arrived, another feast was held to commemorate the prince's first steps and to give him a name. As this took place, the prince himself stood up and said, \"I am a divine king"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"REVITALIZATION / I:Z.I who has descended from space. I am the emanated king Trisong Deutsen, the spontaneously present lord of the earth, ruler of all the black-haired peoples!\"103 Hearing this, all the Tibetan subjects, struck with wonder, showered him with praises and offered prostrations. When he turned thirteen, the king's father passed away and he was enthroned as the ruler of the land. At the same time, however, a power-ful and important minister named Mashang Drompa-kye began to seize power, banning the practice of Buddhism and converting the populace to the native Bon religion. This displeased the king, who then discu,ssed the matter with another important minister, named Go, and asked how they might go about converting all the Tibetan peoples to the Buddhist doctrine. \"That would be wonderful,\" the minister said, \"here is what you should do: make it known that your life is in severe danger, and that if two minis-ters are imprisoned for a period of two years, it will help offset the danger. Then, once you've done that, request that this be put into action.\" Having set the stage in this manner, the king then bribed the soothsay-ers to make them say what he wanted. Once the entire kingdom had heard the news, the king summoned his ministers and court and asked, \"Who will be able to go in my place?\" The elder minister Go stood up. \"Please let me go,\" he said. Out of com-petitiveness, Mashang arose as well and asked \"Please let me go too!\" A prison was then built in the Trang Valley of Tolung, where the tWo ministers were sent along with enough provisions for three years. Later, the elder minister Go was released. Mashang, however, was punished by being imprisoned and set under guard, and the other ministers that were hostile to the Dharma were exiled to other places. The king then discussed matters further with Go and, as a way to get a temple built, they\"gave the choice to the king's ministers and subjects. After some discussion, they decided to build a small temple. The king then invited Shantarakshita to Tibet. When he received the invitation, the abbot responded, \"You are late! I have waited for nine hundred years, and until now you haven't come. When the king was born, however, one tooth began to grow iri my tooth-less mouth.\" With this, he journeyed to the land of Tibet, where he was welcomed by the king and all the ministers. They laid the foundation stone for the temple, but spirits and ghosts did not let them complete its construction. The preceptor then predicted"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"12.2. / GREAT PERFF;CTION that the building would be finished once the master Padmasambhava was invited to Tibet and had subdued the land. As predicted, there was a learned and accomplished master from Oddiyana named Padmasambhava who was serving as the court priest of the Indian king Dharmapala, and whose spiritual powers and miraculous abilities were unimpeded. They invited this master to Tibet, and he proceeded to bind all of the country's wicked spirits and ghosts under oath. Padmasambhava pacified the land with the heruka's dance and vajra gait, whereupon foundation stones were laid on the perimeter. A wall was then erected along this perimeter in a vajralike pattern. At that time, four foremen were appointed and the work was divided up and given to skilled craftsmen from India, China, Shang Shung, Sumpa, Lhobel, Karlok, Li, and Mangyul. All these workers toiled by day, while the eight classes of gods and demons acted as foremen and directed the nonhuman entities to work by night. In this way, the sections that were built at night were even higher than those built during the day. Wonderful paintings, woodwork, and statues also appeared at night. In this way, the Great Spontaneously Present and Eternal Temple of Samye was erected, along with the four major sanctuaries, eight minor sanctuar-ies, the sanctuaries of the sun and the moon, and the three sanctuaries of the queens. All these functioned as the external support. These, as well as the inner supports, were consecrated by the bodhisattva preceptor Shanta-rakshita and the master Padmakara, during the course of which innumer-able wondrous omens occurred. For thirteen years, feasts of auspiciousness and all varieties of performances were put on. For the king and his subjects, the sun of joy and happiness had risen. The preceptor and master matured the king and his subjects by con-ferring a vast range of the Buddha's teachings, both those of the Causal Vehicle of Characteristics and the Fruitional Vehicle of the Secret Man-tra. Many other panditas were invited from India as well. Along with the preceptor and master, they translated and compiled teachings from both the Sutra and Mantra traditions, doing so on a vast scale. In addition, the master Padmasambhava composed sadhanas that related to the tantras, key instructions that related to the sadhanas, and created a system of prac-tice based on these key instructions. With these, he matured the king, his subjects, and their retinue, blessed each and every mountain and cave as a power spot, and filled the land with spiritual treasures.

These direct instructions bring buddhahood in three years and cause the corporeal aggregates to disappear in this very life.

These instructions I will now teach you!\" The great master then revealed the true mandala of the peaceful and wrathful deities in the great feast hall, empowering and offering instruc-tions to a hundred thousand wisdom dakinis, headed by the lady from Kharchen. He taught them all the Seventeen Tantras, with the Tantra of the Clear Expanse of the Sun as the eighteenth, along with a great many key instructions.u14 All these teachings were then grouped into two categories. The first set contained key instructions on the vastness of the tantras, while the second collection was composed by the master himself and contained cycles for simple yogis. Each was then committed to writing and cataloged by the master and Yeshe Tsogyal. It was at this time that the king extended an invitation to the master and his spiritual partner to visit Chimpu. The two then set off, accompanied by the king, the queen, and the royal children. Once there, they began a series of I o 8 tantric feasts. During the course of these feasts, a young, eight-year-old princess named Pemasel, the daughter of the noble Queen Changchup Men of the Drom dan, passed away. Seeing her body, the king burst into tears and fell to the floor unconscious. Yeshe Tsogyal then covered him with a white sash and sprinkled him with sandalwood water, upon which the king regained consciousness. The master then spoke:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"REVITALIZATION / 125 Alas, noble king, worldly affairs are but a dream. By their very character, conditioned things are illusory.

There is nothing whatsoever that is stable and permanent, So do not cling to the impermanent as being permanent. Instead train in the nature of the birthless dharmak.aya! To these words of advice, the master added many prophecies concerning future events and told the king about the series of incarnations that Prin-cess Pemasel was to take. At the conclusion of all this, he prophesied the coming ofTsultrim Dorje and Trime ()zer. The princess was commanded to be the guardian of the profound Heart Essence teachings, and they were then concealed as a profound treasure. Later, just as the master had proph-esied, these teachings were revealed by the omniscient Tsultrirn Dorje and spread far and wide by Trime Ozer.105 --REVITALIZATION --The next set of instructions relates to the practice of revitalization. This topic contains two divisions: ~ A teaching on revitalization ~ How to do the practice Concerning the first of these, the Clear Expanse explains: To realize the nature of original purity, Rest in the natural state and practice revitalization. In the previous stage, the mind itself was allowed to rest in its natural state of nonconceptual clarity. Here, the training consists of gradually"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"12.6 I GREAT PERFECTION integrating this with one's ordinary activities using mild, intermediate, and intense circumstances to familiarize oneselfwith.this state. This is similar to the way someone interested in learning swordsmanship would start out by practicing with a wooden sword. The second section addresses the way to actually do this practice. Practic-ing revitalization with the body, speech, and mind while utilizing specific gazes will enable you to realize what it means to break through to the true nature. As stated in the Last Testament: Revitalize yourself with the gazes Of the listeners, bodhisattvas, and wrathful deities. First is the gaze of the listeners. Start out by seating yourself in the seven-point posture; settle into a meditative state with your legs crossed, hands in the posture of meditation, spine straight, tongue touching the roof of the mouth, breathing relaxed, eyes direc;ted towards the tip of the nose, and the chin tucked slightly i~wards.106 As written in Resting in the Nature Of Mind: The body should be like the king of mountains, with seven points ... As this passage indicates, you should remain motionless, without letting your body or senses vacillate. Do not move your eyes or let your senses chase after the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, and thoughts that occur. Instead, cut the flow of ordinary speech and let the movements of the breath relax on their own. Direct your gaze towards the tip of the nose with a sense of vivid presence. However the six collections of consciousness happen to manifest, do not try to perpetuate or restrain what occurs. Just leave them in their origi.11al condition. Through this, all circumstances and appearances will be clear and nonconceptual by virtue of their very essence, and one then trains by simply not falling out of this state. The Clear Expanse explains: With the peaceful gaze of the listeners, Let body, speech, and mind rest in the natural state."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"REVITALIZATION / 127 Next is the gaze of the bodhisattva. Shifting your eyes from their earlier position, stare blankly into space, gazing with. a sense of vivid presence. This will set the stage for the arising of a momentary state of mind that is both clear and unimpeded. By its very nature, this state of mind does not exist from the moment it arises. Instead; it must be realized to be indivis-ible appearance-emptiness, like the moon's reflection in a pond. The Clear Expame says: With the gaze of the bodhisattvas, Rest in the natural state and bliss itself will be attained. Third is the gaze of the wrathful deity. Without slipping out of this state of absorption, stand up and spread your feet apart. Then proceed to refine your ability by glancing about with your eyes and shouting \"ha ha, hi hi\" as you intensify your awareness. Like a wave dissolving hack into the ocean, with this approach you will be training in the realization of that which is self-occurring and self-manifest, that which is free of elaborations and need not be altered. With this approach, the more circumstances you encounter, the more empty wisdom will continue to develop, just like the relationship between the amount of firewood and the size of a fire. It is also written: With the gaze of the wrathful deity, Rest in the natural state and attain three qualities. To summarize, with the gaze of the listeners, the point of the eyes, the point of the nose, and the point of the mind are concentrated i1;1to a single point and left to themselves, still and motionless.

Ultimately, these coarse afflictions will be conquered by insight-the real-ization of the nature of original purity-and one will be established on the true path. According to the Essential Commentary and Last Testament, the other preliminary practices that were taught earlier are practiced first, while rest-ing in the natural state and revitalization are included in the main practice. Since they are the primary methods used to still the mind, this approach certainly has its place. The presentation here, however, is in line with the approach found in other instruction manuals. When meditating in this way, if you practice with a sense of enthusiasm, there will be few hindrances and your meditation will naturally evolve, whereas being bored or uninterested will end up creating problems for your practice. As is the case when one tries to tame a skittish horse, resis-tance to the meditation process can turn into a habit, so you should be sure to take short rests and cultivate this in a gradual manner.* • Author's note: \"The annotated outline found in the sections on the prc:liminaries and main practice is taken from the instruction manual of Orgyan Terdak Lingpa.\""},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Main Practices of the Heart Essence"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN Probing the Mind and Searching for Its Hidden Flaw ONCE AGAIN, begin by developing supreme bodhichitta.

Of these, when the lifespan had declined to fifty years and most people did not even live to see forty, she was born as Pagangwa Rinchen Dorje11~ in a land to the south of the Seljey Mountain Range that resem-bled a blazing iron cage. In the Year of the Ox, she revealed profound trea-sures from Takpo and Lung Tramo Trak. Instead of putting them into prac-tice, however, she took them from these places and began to travel, which prompted the dakinis to punish her. Consequently, she did not live out her entire lifespan.115 The statement made in the Golden Rosary of Questions and Answers that she would die and wander briefly through the sambhog-akaya pure realms then came to pass, and she dwelt in the Supreme Realm that manifests as the path to those yogis who meditate on the mandala of fivefold light, the appearance of directly perceptible luminosity. The princess was then reborn as Longchenpa in Todrong, located in the Tra Valley of Yoru. His father was the master Tenpa Sungwa and his mother Dromza Sonam Gyen. By the time the boy was seven, he knew how to read and had studied the sadhanas of Gathering of the Blisiful Ones, Vajrakilaya, and the enlightened activity sadhanas of the Guru. By the age of ten, he understood all of these, in addition to having studied astrology, thread-cross rituals,116 and other subjects. At thirteen, he took monastic ordination and studied the Vinaya teach-ings of the sacred Dharma with Khenpo Samdrup Rinchen, at which point he received teachings on the Supreme Scripture, the Sutra of Individual Liberation, the Luminous, and other texts. Next, with various masters he studied texts on philosophy, Entering the Middle J#zy, and various tantras and key instructions, such as those associated with Path and Fruition, Six Applications, Pacification, Severance, Mahamudra, the Mind Section of the Great Perfection, the teaching cycles of Lord Atisha and the Kadam School, and numerous other collections of sadhanas that were held in common by multiple traditions. He trained himself thoroughly by study-ing, contemplating, and meditating on these teachings, eventually reach-ing a point where he had internalized them all and was completely omni-scient. In particular, with the sacred guru Kumaradza he received and prac-ticed the empowerments, explanations, tantras, oral transmissions, and key instructions of the Secret Heart Essence, as well as a great many minor treasures and transmissions of Guru Padmasambhava.

When instructions were . given, and during the course of all the supportive teachings, the entire sky would fill with rainbows. This went on for an entire month. When Longchenpa composed treatises on the great Heart Essence, com-mentaries that have come to be known as the Quintessence of the Dakinis, various wondrous omens occurred. A great many beings were brought to the state of liberation and omniscience through the empowerments, expla-nations, and instructions of the Heart Essence. The unique instructions that are being taught here stem from this lineage. --THE PROFOUND PATH OF MEDITATION --This second section addresses the profound path of meditation, the main practice of the Great Perfection. These instructions include the path of breakthrough, which shows the true nature of original purity to be free of all elaborations, and the path of the direct leap, which points direcdy to the spontaneous presence of wisdom. The first of these topics is divided further into: x) ascertaining the true nature and 2) pointing out awareness in its original state. ·As stated in the Essential Instructions on the Essence Tantras That Lib-erate upon Yvt:aring, ascertaining the true nature takes place in three steps: First probe the conceptual mind, Then seek out its hidden flaw, Finally, examine its origin, presence, and departure. PROBING THE MIND To begin, go to an isolated place and sit down in the seven-point posture of Vairochana. With your legs in the vajra posture, place your hands beneath your navel in the meditation mudra, spread your shoulders out like the wings of a vulture, and straighten your spine like an arrow. Lower your gaze to the tip of your nose, place your tongue on the roof of the mouth, and tuck your chin slighdy inward.

Don't move your eyes or glance about in agitation. They should be neither wide open nor closed. The eyes and mouth should be placed in such a way that they lead to an experience of open clarity. Don't block your senses, just relax your body and sit free and easy, like a bundle of straw with its rope cut. Sitting comfortably, relaxed, and with a sense of lightness is a skillful way to relax the four external elements and the physical body. The Tantra of the Clear Expanse states: Do not move, let your body rest at ease. Do not speak, leave your voice where it is. Do not think, let your mind relax naturally. Open your eyes slightly and gaze into space. Keep a space the size of a barley seed Between your teeth, your mouth barely open. Let your three gates relax with the_ breath And rest for a brief time upon exhaling. The same text then reads: Without giving free rein to the mind's thoughts and memories, Direct your eyes to the very tip of your nose, And then from the nose, direct your attention to the tip of the mind. Bring them all to a single point and rest in a state of equanimity. · As you rest in a state of equanimity as taught here, examine the essence of what is being settled into and that which is doing the settling. The three gates are the basis for~all positive and negative experiences, all our happi-ness and sadness. The one who experiences, the experience itself, and what is experienced all come down to these three. For this very reason, we must carefully examine which of these three is the primary factor. Examine the body, with its feelings of pleasure and pain, hot and cold, and hunger and fullness. Analyze all the positive and negative verbaliza-tions associated with speech, and all the mind's perceptions that are medi-ated by the five senses, the good ones we embrace and the bad ones we reject. Examine and investigate body, speech, and mind from every angle. Which of them is the primary factor?

Who serves as the basis for all these expe-riences of happiness and sorrow? Who affirms some things and negates others?

Who is it that experiences the happiness and suffering that result from these acts? Is it body, speech, or mind? Contemplate each of these three with great care. Are these three separate factors, or do they function as a whole? By examining and analyzing these questions, you will come to under-stand that the mind is at the root of everything, and it will be as though you've recognized a thie£ This is alluded to in the following passages. The Ckar~anses~tes: This alone is the basis of all samsara and nirvana. And in the Tantra of the Secret Essence: The mind itsdfhas no basis or root, Yet it is the root of all phenomena.

Is it something that can be perceived as an actual entity or not? Examine and analyze this question carefully. What about its color? Is it white, yel-low, red, green, or blue? Is it the same as the body, speech, and conceptual mind, or is it something other than these three? When you come across something that you like or something you don't, when you hear something pleasant or unpleasant, or when you feel all the variations of happiness and sadness, is the mind the same as these experi-ences or different? If it is the same, then the mind would end up having color, since it would have to be the same as the body. If you think that"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"PROBING THE MIND I 141 they're different, however, then examine where the mind might be apart from these experiences. By analyzing in this way, you will come to see that, in fact, they are nei-ther the same nor different. With this, the indivisible particles of the body will naturally dissolve altogether and the mind will vanish without a trace •. like the path of a bird in the sky. When this has come to pass, you will have come to know the mind's hidden flaw. Awareness is not any particular thing, yet it is present with vivid clar-ity. It is not limited in any way; it is neither subject nor object, something that arises or ceases, and it is neither permanent nor nothing at all. Beyond being an object that can be precisdy described, it is primordially free of all signs of confusion. Hence, as the Garland of Pearls teaches: The original purity of the basic state Does not know even the word \"confusion,\" What need to mention \"unconfused\"? Therefore, confusion is originally pure. THE ORIGIN, PRESENCE, AND DEPARTURE OF ¥IND Even though you may not find any hidden flaw in terms of the ground, you should still examine and analyze the essence of this mind that clings to a self where there is none. Where does it first come from; where does it stay, and where does it go in the end? Further, how does it originate, in what way is it present, and how does it cease? The Clear Expanse states: Next, in what way is the mind present? You may say it exists, but it is empty of being a thi~g. Yet if you say it does not, there is still the clarity of the analytic process. Empty and clear-it is devoid of anything to identify. In this way, leave the mind to itself and search inside and out for its loca-tion. Though you may not find the essence of that which is present, mind still gets caught up in the past, present, and future with its endless prolif-eration of discursive thought. Hence, consciousness is in a constant state of flux. What are these fluctuations of consciousness actually like? Where do they go?

If it departs from a point of nonexistence, then the idea that there is something departing makes no sense. How does t,his agent, the essence of that which departs, actually do so? Do its movements resemble those of a god or human? Does it burrow into the ground or fly through space? Does it move about with the form of one of the six classes of existence? What are its characteristics, color, and size? This process of analysis contains the key instructions for seeking out the mind. Since these instructions are of the utmost importance, carry out this process with great care, diligently analyzing day and night. This is called \"using the mind to seek the mind\" and \"using the mind to tame the mind.\" It is also called \"searching for mind's hidden flaw,\" \"destroying the mind's abode,\" and \"exposing the deceptive cavern of the mind.\" Pursue the mind relentlessly as though you are putting it on trial; exam-ine its characteri~tics in minute detail like you're thrusting a spear at an opponent with a shield or as though you are threading a needle. What you are doing here is using the mind to tame itself, in the same way that rock can be used to break down rock and iron to cut iron. By examining and analyzing the mind in this manner, you will come to see that there is no such concrete entity anywhere at all. Once you've arrived at this point, the observer will function as an antidote, and the very object that is being observed will be purified into its empty, rootless nature, in the same way that the leaves of a tree will automatically wither away once its trunk has been cut. The awareness that observes all this as well can-not be accurately represented with verbal approximations, for in essence, discerning self-awareness is innately pure and self-manifest as spontane-ously present wisdom. In this context, when you~ mind is still, lo~k at the essence of this still-ness, and if it moves, look at the essence of its movement. In this way, sustain the natural flow of the unimpeded display of awareness, which is beyond any sense of observer and observed. This, in turn, will actualize the true nature of innate emptiness and original purity.

This is how it was described by the omniscient lord of Dharma Longchenpa.117 The first approach is used to determine that the mind is groundless and rootless, while the l~tter shows the true nature, in which one rests evenly in the nature that was ascertained. This process of exami-nation and analysis must be carried out in a precise manner, methodically and continuously."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Empowerment into the Display oJAwareness and Pointing Out the Nature of Mind EMPOWERMENT INTO --THE DISPLAY OF AWARENESS --THE VARIOUS instructions that have been given up to this point should be practiced in conjunction with the four empowerments, as taught by the omniscient lord of Dharma in the Quintessence of the Dakinis. To daborate, once the daborate vase empowerment has been bestowed, one should begin contemplating the rarity ofthe freedoms and endowments, and then proceed through the physical preliminary of the vajra stance. Next, the unelaborate, secret empowerment is given and one practices the verbal preliminaries. Following this, the knowledge-wisdom empower-· ment is bestowed in conjunction with the mental preliminaries, and then the word empowerment in tandem with probing the conceptual mind and searching for its hidden flaw. In this context, it is said that the empowerment into the display of awareness should be bestowed prior to pointing out the nature of mind. If, however, one has not been able to combine the elaborate vase empow-erment and the other empowerments with the instructions as outlined above, there is also a tradition in which the five empowerments of aware-ness are bestowed at this point.118 Whatever the case, a brief outline of the display empowerment should be presented. Once again, begin by developing bodhichitta. Think to yoursdf. \"So that all the infinite number of sentient beings may swiftly attain the state of unsurpassed, perfect, and complete buddhahood, I will listen to the sacred Dharma and put the teachings into practice!\" With this motivation, listen carefully.

Accordingly, you should cultivate the habit oflisteningwith respect, phys-ically, verbally, and mentally. Those who are disrespectful, lack faith, or whose behavior is merely superficial, whether physically, verbally, or mentally, are not to be taught the Dharma. On this point, the Jiflay of the Bodhisattva states: Do not teach the Dharma to those without respect, To those who wrap their heads with doth, though not sick; To those with parasols, staffs, or weapons, Or those whose heads are covered. Hence, you should avoid any inappropriate behavior when listening to the Buddhist teachings. Listen to the teachings with faith and a keen interest in the sacred Dharma and the gutu. At this stage the empowerment into the display of awareness is to be bestowed. The previous stages of probing the conceptual mind and search-ing for its hidden flaw must not be left in the realm of theory. Instead, these instructions should be distilled down to their very essence and put into practice, whereby the mind's true nature will be thoroughly resolved. Those who have done so may then receive the display empowerment and the various pointing out instructions. If these teachings are given to those who have not gone through this process and are just interested in studying them in a theoretical, superfi-cial manner, they will be of no great benefit.

The texts of the Heart Essence state:119 · Then the buddhas Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri Taught the maturing empowerment into the display of awareness. As the same text then explains, the empowerment into the display of awareness, the infinite transmission, has preliminary steps, a main part, and a conclusion. The text reads: A fully qualified guru Should teach the fortunate student The threefold empowerment of infinity. The display empowerment should be bestowed as taught in the texts of this tradition. To be empowered into the display of awareness means to recognize your own pristine awareness-your original state. This awareness, the essence of primordial buddhahood, has been with you from the very beginning; the guru merely points it out. It is this pointing out, however, that will allow you to recognize the mind's genuine nature for yourself, at which point whatever manifests will be liberated as the display of awareness. In other words, having the nature of mind pointed out will allow you to recognize that each and every phenomena throughout samsara and nirvana, all that appears and exists, is the display of your very own awareness. By simply mastering your own awareness, you will have received the most supreme empowerment of all. The same text then explains: Receive the essence, the direct empowerment of the display. This great embodiment, the nature of innate radiance, [Is the attainment of the empowerment of infinite awareness.]"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"148 / GREAT PERFECTION If the empowerment into the display of awareness is not received, Being liberated by conditioned rituals is impossible.120 Those who have yet to attain the empowerment into the display of aware-ness will never reach buddhahood just by being shown many mandalas made of the five precious jewels, receiving sanctified water over and over again, having crowns placed on their heads, or participating in tantric feasts. On this point, the Clear Expanse states: Without the empowerment of infinite awareness, It is impossible t;o be matured by conditioned empowerments. Therefore, receiving this empowerment will automatically purify all the obscurations of ignorance and deepen [one's realization]. Alternately, the five unique awareness empowerments may also be bestowed at this point. There are two steps to this process: First, one who has not received these empowerments must do so. Second, this must be stabilized in the recipient's mind stream. The first of these has a prelimi-nary' step, a main part, and a conclusion. As the preliminary step a man-dala must be offered, as this sets the stage for the-realization of the mir-rorlike nature of awareness. In the main part of the empowerment, there are two stages, the first of which pertains to the empowerment into the display of awareness that matures the recipient. For this empowerment, five syllables• are visualized at the five places, relating to the five chakras, five kayas, and five wisdoms. Then one recites these syllables while visual-izing their projection and absorption. This process serves to purify the five affiictions.121 In the main part of the practice, the direct empowerment into the dis-play of awareness is bestowed. This empowerment functions to bring the mandala of the heart ofluminosity into view, which allows one to proceed to the level of the exhaustion of reality itsel£ 122 Once these two stages are complete, one may proceed to the third sec-tion, the conclusion, at which point a feast is performed.

Finally, to stabUize this in one's being, one must habitu-ate oneself to the nature of the four visions. --POINTING OuT THE NATURE OF MIND ---Next, awareness is pointed out in its original state. This occurs in three stages. Awareness is first pointed out using the s.killftil transmission of ~lessings, then through the view, and finally experientially through meditation. POINTING OuT THE NATURE OF MIND THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION OF BLESSINGS To point out the nature of mind through the transmission of blessings, begin by making offerings and supplications with a vast feast offering. Next, the students should offer a mandala and then seat themselves in the correct posture. This last point is addressed in Resting in the Nature of Mind: Tranquility is achieved by relaxing body, speech, and mind. Its primary component involves thoroughly pacifying all focal points In a state of the natural equality of all phenomena, WhUe fixing the mind on a single focal point is a supplementa,l technique. As stated here, states of nonconcept~al absorption are attained by relaxing the three gates. When the body is relaxed, the energetic chan-nels relax. When clre energetic channels are relaxed, the energies relax. When the energies are relaxed, the eleme~ts r.elax, and then the petals of the four chakras and so forth stay where they are meant to be. This will bring about the automatic occurrence of tranquUity and mental stillness. The reason for this is that the essential elements, which serve as the basis for the mind, will have been brought to a state of immobility and will stay in one place. When meditating by relaxing in this manner, there will be a natural absence of any tendency to repress or indulge thoughts. This is the essential and primary form of tranquUity meditation. As a supplemental technique,"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"ISO I GREAT PERFECTION one may also fix the mind on a single focal point to attain stability. This latter approach elicits a slight degree of nonconceptuality. In a fundamental sense,· the nature of mind does not come from any-where, stay anywhere, or go anywhere; it is always present in a state of even spaciousness. In being clear and lucid, it is insight, and in being still, it is tranquility. The term \"integration\" refers to the indivisibility of these two. The presence of these integrated factors is present in each and every sentient being at all times. When the clarity of mind naturally enters a state of stillness and relaxation, its ·true nature can be pointed out with ease. Liberation occurs when the meditator understands tranquility and insight, which means to simply let be, without trying to correct or modify anything, regardless of whether the mind is active or at rest. To give the actual pointing out instructions, start by taking the teacher who is giving the instructions as the basis for your meditation and go through the stages of visualiza~ion that were described earlier in the guru yoga section. Develop a sense of certainty that your guru is the very essence of the Three Jewels, that he or she has done away with every fault, per-fected every positive quality, and is capable of fulfilling all your needs and desires. Surrender yourself totally, putting your trust in the fact that the guru knows just what to do. With a feeling of devotion so overwhelming that your eyes well up with tears, think to yourself, \"Sacred root and lineage gurus, please think of me with your boundless compassion and bless my entire being! Grant your blessings that the unique realizations of this profound path may take birth in my mind!\" The guru should then supplicate the lineage gurus one by one, begin-ning with the lines, \"I supplicate you, dharmakaya buddha Samantab-hadra! Grant your blessings that _the unique experiences and realizations of this profound path might take birth in the mind!\" Once the blessings of the lineage gurus have been invoked with these lines, the guru melts into light out of his or her boundless compassion before dissolving into the crown of the student's head. The student should then be encouraged to settle their mind loosely within the state of simplic-ity that ensues, in which the student's three gates are indivisible with the three vajras of the guru. · Settling in this state will stir up the blessings and cause the appearances of the three gates to merge with the guru. All thoughts will then mani-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"EMPOWERMENT INTO THE DISPLAY OF AWARENESS I 151 fest as devotion. By relaxing loosely in this experience, radiant awareness will manifest vividly as devotion. The innate nature will dawn freely and without fixation, and devotion will be liberated as self-awareness. This is referred to as birthless self-awareness, which is free within the sphere of original purity. Just let be and maintain the flow of this state without try-ing to alter it in any way. Though these instructions are not explicitly mentioned in the primary teachings, they carry a great deal of blessings, as they are capable of gener-ating an enhanced experience of the practice tradition of the gurus. POINTING OuT THE TRUE NATURE THROUGH THE VIEW According to the Essential Instructions, pointing out the true nature of mind takes place in seven stages. The text reads: Thoughts are pointed out to be mind, mind to be empty, empti-ness to be appearance, appearances and emptiness to be insepa-rable, inseparability to be self-liberated, the five poisons to be self-liberated, and the six collections of consciousness to be self-liberated. Pointing Out Thoughts to Be Mind To begin, let your three gates. be as they are. Within this state, let some phenomena arise suddenly in your mind: All the vmous phenomena that manifest in this way are just like the experiences in a dream. Though they appe~ to exist from the perspective of one's own deluded thoughts, they do not have even an atom of true existence in any objective sense. A single basis [for perception] will be perceived in different ways by different beings, due ~to the differences in karma that the beings in the six classes of existence possess. Though appearances contain no distinctions in and of themselves, they appear to be separate. Even a single being will be determined to be a friend by some and an enemy by others. Therefore, however they may manifest in one's mind, thoughts are never anything other than the mind itsel£ Subject and object are, therefore, indivisible. Hence, thoughts can be determined to be mind. Even the buddhas have not seen, do not see, and will not see the essence of mind, so aside from these thoughts that manifest so vividly what else could indicate its presence? The Clear Expanse says:"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"152 / GREAT PERFECTION The mind's thoughts and memories are the display of awareness. The entire range of appearances and consciousness .

In fact, it cannot be established in any way whatsoever. As it is free of all elaborations, it cannot be pinpointed with precise descriptions. Hence, the mind can be determined to be emptiness. A tantra states: Turn your attention b;tck on the very factor that creates movement. There is no need to reject it, for it will be self-liberated like the breeze. And in Infinite Bliss: In and ofitself, the mind has no root. It cannot be found by searching nor identified, A state of emptiness, this is how it has always been. It is ineffable, self-occuring wisdom. Pointing Out Emptiness to Be Appearance In essence, emptiness knows no change, yet its natural display is an unim-peded avenue of manifestation that can appear in any way whatsoever. The tantras explain: This unimpeded display can manifest in any way-Empty, clear, and aware, yet without change. And:"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"EMPOWERMENT INTO THE DISPLAY OF AWARENESS I 153 The nature of emptiness can appear in any way, Yet the very character of appearance is birthless. Pointing Out Appearance and Emptiness to Be Inseparable Appearances as well have no other causes or conditions. Rather, they are the self-display of emptiness, like the moon's reflection in a pool of water. The inseparability of appearance and emptiness is present as the very essence of discerning self-awareness. The Tantra of the Sun and Moon's Union explains: For those who realize that observed objects Have no inherent existence of their own, Appearance and emptiness are not tWo. Pointing Out Inseparability to Be Self-liberated This inseparability of appearance and emptiness is self-occurring aware-ness. Awareness, in turn, is vivid and free of elaborations, unconditioned and spontaneously present. Hence, it is self-liberated in the sphere of the three kayas. On this point, the Tantra of Inlaid jewels states: Perfect buddhahood is self-awareness itself, The essence of which is unchanging throughout the three times. Pointing Out the Five Poisons to Be Self-liberated When anger manifests, look directly at its essence and then rest at ease. With. this approach there is no need to eliminate anger, as it is self-lib-erated as the wisdom of clarity-emptiness. The same holds for whatever thoughts of the five poisons happen to arise, which will manifest in their essential and innate form: passion as bliss-emptiness, confusion as non-conceptuality, and pride and envy as self-clarity. In other words, they will be liberated into the presence of the five wisdoms. We can extrapolate from this that whatever nonvirtuous thoughts happen to arise, including the five root and twenty subsidiary affiictions, they can all be understood to be self-manifest and self-liberated. As written in the Clear Expanse: This alone is the basis of all samsara and nirvana, Self-occurring wisdom arising in and of itsel£ Knowing this is referred to as \"mere wisdom.\""},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"154 / GREAT PERFECTION Pointing Out the Six Collections to Be Self-liberated In a similar manner, by observing whatever appearances arid thoughts hap-pen to manifest, whether coarse or subtle, they will be seen to be devoid ·of inherent existence. This holds for form and the other objects of the six collections, as well as the subjects to which they appear; they all lack any ba5is and are self-liberated as great primordial emptiness. The Tantra of the Sun and Moon's Union states: For those who realize that observed objects Have no inherent existence of their own, Appearance and emptiness are not two. In brief, however it may manifest, the nature of awareness is such that it is beyond being bound or freed; it is free of elaborations and self-liberated within the space of original purity. Hence, it has already arrived at a point of perfection, for its true nature transcends meditator and object. As writ-ten in the Tantra of Penetrating Sound: . Self-awareness is free of all conceptuality, And is thus endowed with four great forms ofliberation: It is primordially liberated, with no basis for being liberated again. It is self-liberated and ~us needs no remedy. It is directly liberated, dissolving right where it is seen. It is thoroughly liberated, with no need for effort and strain. One gains introduction through this itself by cutting through to the very root of birthlessness. One comes to a resolution through this single point by ascertaining that it is unceasing. Finally, in coming to ascertain inseparability, one masters the display through liberation.123 Th~ import of these three statements is none other than what was just explained above.

To rest freely like a mountain, let your body remain motionless in the seven-point posture ofVairodiana. To rest freely like the ocean, keep your eyes still; look straight ahead about one arrow-length into space with a sense of vivid presence. To let your awareness rest freely, remain untainted by thoughts of the past, present, and future. This present moment of consciousness manifests, yet is unidentifiable. Without trying to add or remove anything, just let be in the .state of reality itsel£ As the student rests in this manner, say the following: Now listen, fortunate. one. Look without distraction at the naked self-clarity of this present moment of awareness. Do not indulge your thoughts or try to rein them in. Awareness cannot be spoiled by moral judgments or tainted by hope and fear. It is clear, yet ungraspable; lucid, yet without inside or out; wide open, but without slipping into a ~tate of diffusion. It is inher-ently radiant, yet cannot be identified. It is transparent, expan-sive, and even. This naked state, just as it is, is the dharmakaya itself-naturally luminous and unchanging. Simply maintain recognition of this ungraspable self-radiance. This is buddhahood, pure and pristine, The dharmakaya of unchanging self-awareness-Vivid, vibrant, and clear, like a cloudless autumn sky. Rest like a mountain, steady and immutable. Rest like the ocean, still and clear. Rest like space, infinite in breadth. However still your mind may be, Rest in that as the state of awareness.

Rest in the self-clarity of phenomena, Which never waver from the state of awareness, Just as birds can never escape space, wherever they may Hy. By following these instructions, the mind will enter a state oflucid clar-ity. Next, exclaim the syllable P'ET and use the distraction this creates to destroy this nonconceptuallucidity. A state of consciousness will then manifest that is free from conceptual impressions and the antidotes that are applied to them, an uninhibited state of self-illuminating basic sim-plicity. This must be recognized as the absorption of the natural stillness of awareness. Regardless of whether the mind is still or in motion, and whether you find yourself repressing negative thoughts or indulging positive ones, sim-ply look directly at the natural How of self-awareness. This will bring about an .absorption of unfi.xated, natural stillness, which will manifest nakedly and vividly. The \"riverlike\" meditation of effortless spontaneous presence is to be found here alone. Once you have attained some stabUity in this, you can begin integrat-ing this state of absorption with your ordinary activities by mingling mild, moderate, and intense activities with your meditative experience. Through this, all acts, expressions, thoughts, and memories will manifest as the play of reality itsel£ There will be no differentiation between formal medita-tion sessions and postmeditation, no gap between day and night, and no discriminating between right and wrong. Without making a distinction between meditator and me.ditation, everything will manifest as the radi-ance of awareness; you will cross over into the exhaustion of phenomena, the wisdom mind of original purity. This is alluded to in the Tantra ofPen-etrating Sound: When it come~ to wisdom, the originally pure essence, Not even the word \"ignorance\" is a possibility.

Next, consciously create various discursive thoughts; let the mind make its discriminations, then simply let go and relax. Doing this will cause all of these elaborations to completely subside and you will come to rest in your original state. Like the stillness and open clarity of an ocean with no waves, your presence will be one of empty clarity, the coemergent wisdom that is the true and primordial nature. As written in the Tantra oJSelfaris-ing Awareness: Beyond the two extremes of permanence and nothingness, And with the impurities of the four extremes naturally cleared away ... Because its essence, nature, and compassion are inseparable, the mind is dharmakaya in being free of elaborations, sambhogakaya in its fixation-free clarity, and nirmanakaya in being the unimpeded basis for the mani-festation of the variety of experiences. The Tantra of Inlaid jewels states: Perfect buddhahood is self-awareness-In essence, unchanging throughout the three times, By nature, eternally unimpeded, And with compassion that manifests universally. And in the Tantra of Penetrating Sound: Wisdom, in its original condition, Cannot be separated into three modes. Pointing Out Movement to Be the Play of the Mind Whatever manifests as the unimpeded display of this clear and noncon-ceptual mind, do not try to repress and reject some experiences or indulge and embrace others.

The Tantra oflnlaid]ewels explains: This unimpeded display can manifest as anything, Yet this manifestation is liberated in and of itsel£ Even the word \"liberated\" cannot describe it, So how could it possibly be said to be \"unliberated\"? From the very moment it manifests, there is no need to apply an anti-dote to awareness, for it is self-liberated like the coil of a snake. As the Tan-tra of Penetrating Sound teaches: Awareness, however it may manifest, Self-liberates like the coil of a snake. Pointing Out the Nonduality of Movement and Stillness Out of the nonconceptual state of the mind itself, a variety of thoughts may manifest unimpededly. When they do, simply let them be. Do not try to repress and reject some while indulging and embracing others. In so doing, you will not waver from the state of reality itself and the self-display of this stil~ness will project forth without obstruction. Hence, by their very nature, movement and stillness are inseparable. Waves may arise on the surface of the ocean iri a variety of ways, but in the end they dissolve back into it and the two become indistinguishable. In just the same way, thoughts may arise and subside suddenly, yet they are never anything other than states of reality itself, regardless of how they may manifest.

By pointing this awareness out, one will then be able to cut through .superimpositions regarding the true nature. Next, one need only maintain the continuity of this recogni-. tion and keep it from being lost, through which it will gradually stabilize. On the other hand, if the nature of this meditation is not actually expe-rienced hut is instead left in the realm of theory, when the true nature of mind is pointed out in this context the element of surprise will have been lost. If this happens to be the case, one should again meditate assiduously on the stages of contemplation that were outlined earlier. Then, by being taught and practicing in such a way that pointing out the true nature of mind elicits actual experience, one will gradually begin to experience its full significance. The King Who Creates All concludes: With wisdom purified of dual and nondual, Meditation and nonmeditation are just names. Meditation is necessary so long as one has yet to arrive at self-manifes-tation and self-liberation, as conceptuality will continue to function in its ordinary, usual waiuntil this has come to pass. Hence, as taught in the Resting in the Nature of Mind: In particular, negative thoughts lead one into existence. To liberate them, one must utilize the skillful method of absorption, And later the wide-open expanse of knowledge will manifest, liberated from all extremes. As stated here, thoughts are what propel us into samsara.

There is no question that if we meditate to bring an end to such thoughts, a time will come when the knowledge that sees the complete liberation of all phenomena will manifest. Once you have moved beyond the realm of thought and concept into reality itself, conceptual constructs will dissolve into the sphere of reality and become of one taste with the dharmakaya. Accompanied by the experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality, the great wisdom mind of the luminous Great Perfection will manifest, transcending all examples, meanings, and illustrations. The King Who Cre-ates All explains: The three times are one; they are no different.

Who could possibly show what this sacred glory is? In the King ofSamadhi Sutra, it is written: If one settles the mind without thinking On reality itself. inconceivable as it is, An experience of the impartial view will arise; This is what we refer to as \"absorption.\" When coemergent, self-occurring wisdom manifests, the practitioner will come to see all forms of polarity as fundamentally the same-good and bad, appearance and emptiness, existence and nonexistence, samsara and peace, and knower and known. In other words, as exemplified by the eight examples of illusion, all subjective and objective perceptions will be seen to be none other than the essence of reality itself, in the sense that their very nature is one of nonarising. Hence, appearance and emptiness will be seen to be an overarching unity. In Resting in the Nature of Mind, Longchenpa writes: All appearance and emptiness are an overarching unity, Beyond all extremes of existence and nonexistence. Free from the idea of existence and peace being different, The knower and known are one in essence. Reality itself is seen, where neither sameness nor difference exist. The King Who Creates All states: However things may appear, they are one within suchness, For within this majestic state of uncontrived equality, The wisdom mind of the nonconceptual dharmakaya manifests from within.

This will cause thoughts to dissolve like clouds in the sky and you will be able to rest evenly in the view. On this point, the King Who Creates All says: Ho! Vajra being, meditate on things as they are. Realize the view that things are liberated on their own. And: Rest in this nature without distraction; there is no need for effort, For everything is self-occurring and liberated on its own. Let this mind, unborn like space, Rest in the state that is unborn and unceasing. In Resting in the Nature of Mind, Longchenpa writes: Settling free from distraction, Without indulging thoughts or trying to rein them in, In a state of purity, in which the nature of mind is unborn like sky, Do not focus on mental events and they will dissolve like a bank of clouds, And the undistracted mind, now free from clouds, Will settle evenly into its basic state, the state of things as they are. There are a number of points that one should be aware of in this con-text. When putting these teachings into practice, there are certain general factors that block absorption from developing. Addressing this topic, the venerable Maitreya taught: Being lazy, forgetting the instructions, Dullness and agitation, Nonapplication and application-These are the five flaws. And concerning the eight applications that remedy these five: The eight applications that eliminate them Are the basis and what is based on it, Cause and result,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"CONCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS I 165 To not forget one's focal point, To notice dullness and agitation, To fully apply oneself to the elimination of these factors, And rest naturally once they are pacified.'2~ When you rest in equipoise on a given object, it may seem as though your thought activity is increasing, or, alternately, your mind may experi-ence a blank, vacant state. At other times, it may not stay still, or even if it does, a subtle form of mental activity may occur in its depths that cannot be blocked. All three of these herald the onset of stillness. Conceptual activity cannot be stopped by being forcibly blocked. On the other hand, if you push the mind to its breaking point by consciously creating an endless stream of discursive thought, mental activity will even-tually wear itself out and the mind will end up in its original state of still-ness. Once this occurs, simply rest in this state. This process is tradition-ally likened to a crow perched on a ship. The crow will repeatedly take off and fly about, but it will only circle around and around before returning to alight on the vessel once again. Without relying on a state of stillness or movement, and identifying with neither the objective six collections nor the subjective consciousness, simply maintain the mind's original state. In essence, the mind is beyond being permanent or nothing at all; it is not born and does not die. It is self-aware and self-illuminating, while the appearances that manifest as its unimpeded and radiant display are vast and spacious. It is vividly clear, transcending the realm of words and expression. By maintaining this origi-nal state without distraction, your realization of the true nature will evolve and grow increasingly stable. If dullness predominates, clear away your stale breath, tighten up your physical posture, and•elevate your gaze. As you concentrate your mind, focus intently by intensifying your awareness. On the other hand, if your mind is restless and agitated, lower your gaze and look down, find a more relaxed position, and simply let be in a state of deep relaxation. At times, when the sky is clear and cloudless, turn your back to the sun and direct your gaze into the depths of space. The empty radiance of exter-nal space is used as a metaphor that will help you connect with the utterly pure space of mind that is present within.

Addressing the five obstructions, Resting in the Nature of Mind states: As practical methods to be used at such times, Drowsiness, torpor, agitation, regret, and doubt-the five obstructions-Should be eliminated, and tranquility and-insight should be practiced in tandem. Drowsiness and torpor thoroughly obstruct tranquility, While agitation and regret distract one from insight, And doubt does harm to and conflicts with both. As noted here, there are five factors that obstruct absorption for those engaged in yogic practice. The clear lucidity that is discerned in genu-ine tranquility is disrupted by drowsiness and torpor, both of which cre-ate a state of dullness. Agitation and regret, on the other hand, create thought activity that keeps one from remaining one-pointedly focused on the lucidity of insight. Doubt can disrupt the attainment of either of these two. With drowsiness, one loses the ability to direct the mind and it withdraws inward, while torpor involves a neutral frame of mind that cannot focus clearly on its object. Agitation is mental activity that is directed externally towards objects. Regret is a state of intense aversion in which one obsesses about a particular activity. With doubt one experi-ences hesitation, which keeps one from carrying out an activity yet to be completed. Concerning the necessity of approaching these in the correct manner, Letter to a Friend states: Agitation, regret, malice, torpor, Drowsiness, attraction to pleasure, and doubt-Know that these five obstructions are thieves That will steal away the wealth of virtue. Hence, counting agitation and regret as one, drowsiness and torpor as one, and adding attraction to pleasure, malice, and doubt, there are five in all.

This will cause the entire range of conceptual constructs to dissolve into the mind's basis, the nature of mind, at which point the mind will become motionless and stable. Once this has come to pass, you will be liberated from samsara and freed from the dualistic fixation on self and other. The form of the unsurpassed dharmakaya-the great transcendence of elaborations, ideas, and expressions-will be attained. As taught in the Songs of Realization: When you thoroughly investigate both entities and nonentities, All that moves will completely dissolve. The mind will then become motionless, naturally still and stable, Which will bring about a self-liberation from the entities of samsara.

The key point of the body is to sit in an upright manner and let the mind rest in its natu-ral state. The key point of speech is to expel your stale breath three times, imagining that you are purifying all illness, harmful forces, negativity, and obscurations. The key point of the mind is to think to.yourself, \"~am going to practice this profound path for the benefit of all sentient beings!\" With this thought, visualize your guru on the crown of your head and pray with boundless devotion: \"Essence of all buddhas throughout the three times, lqnd root guru, I pray to you!

To use another example, just as the limbs of a snake are not visible unless it is squeezed, if the physical posture is not adjusted, the mind will not rest. The sages of the past gave a profound piece of advice on this point, with the saying \"By establishing an interdependent connec-tion in the body, realization will arise in the mind.\" In the first session of the day, expel the stale breath in a ninefold cycle, and use a threefold cycle in the remaining sessions. For the ninefold cycle, exhale three times through the left nostril, one exhalation gently, one moderate, and one forceful. Then exhale three more times through the right nostril and three through both together. In the threefold cycle, exhale one time through the left nostril, once through the right, and on,ce through both together. As you do this exercise, imagine that all the neg-ativity, obscurations, hindrances, obstacles, and every other unfavorable factor that has been accumulated since time immemorial, both your own and that of others as well, is gathered together all at once. Along with the breath flowing through your nostrils, it is completely expelled and the inte-rior of your b9dy is completely purified, as though it has been completely washed out. This can be likened to cleaning out a vessel prior to pouring a wholesome substance into it. Next, cultivate bodhichitta by thinking to yourself, \"For the benefit of all the infinite number of sentient beings, I will now practice these pro-found key instructions of the Great Perfection!\" Following this, recite these lines: 0 precious and glorious root guru, Please dwell on the lotus seat on my crown. Accept me with your immense kindness, Grant me siddhis ofbody, speech, and mind! As you make this prayer, visualize a lotus, sun, and moon disc seat on the crown of your head, with your own kind root guru seated upon it in the form ofVajrasattva. His form is replete with the signs and marks ofbud-dhahood and adorned with silks and jewels. In his hands, he holds a vajra and bell and his legs are in the sattva posture."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"APPENDIX I / 177 As you visualize in this manner, pray: \"Please grant your blessings: mature and liberate my mind!\" To this you may add: \"Bless me that the unique realizations of this profound path may take birth in my mind!

Next, visualize a stream of white nectar flowing out of the big toe on the guru's right foot and entering through the aperture ofBrahma on your head. This nectar completely saturates your entire body and triggers the wisdom of great bliss. To conclude, imagine that the guru melts into light and dissolves into you."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"APPENDIX II Garap Dorjls Three Statements That Strike the Vital Point Be introduced through this itsel£ Come to a resolution through one thing.

Though there are many ways to illustrate this breakthrough, here I will use the final testament of the nirmanakaya buddha. These three statements that strike the vital point introduce one's own ~wareness to be the pristine dharmakaya. Be introduced through this itself.

Vivid, clear, and pristine, it is unestablished by its very essence, yet at the same time its radiance is unimpeded. This is original purity at its most fundamental, the bare empty awareness of the dharmakaya. The Tantra of the Secret Sound states: Without memories of the past or thoughts of the future, Your mind, in this very present moment, Is vibrantly awake, crystal clear, and vivid:· Recognize this to be the fourfold dharmakaya. As stated here, simply observe your awareness in this very present moment, just as .it is. It cannot be spoiled by the comings and goings of thoughts and memories, nor corrupted by ordinary thoughts of good and bad. There is something here that is at once both vivid, yet devoid of thoughts; devoid of thoughts, yet vivid. In essence, this naked transparency is the dharma-kaya; innate wisdom, free of elaborations; original purity, untainted by the mind's stains; the state of primordial freedom, unbound by the fixation of meditative experiences-this is buddhahood, the ever-present dharma-kaya. Here one is introduced to this constant bare awareness through this very same awareness. Come to a resolution through one thing. Now, simply rest without distraction in what was just pointed out. This is the wisdom mind of the dharmakaya buddhas Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri, the recognition of the great spontaneous presence of non-meditation. With this decisive certainty, let yourself expand into the wide-open space of self-illuminating awareness. Aside from simply resting in this spacious vast expanse, open and unrestricted, there isn't the slightest trace of anything to meditate on here, nothing to think about or recollect, and nothing to pay attention to.

Arising and liberation, moreover, are simultaneous; manifestation and liberation do not happen at different times. The display dissolves into the ground, mother and son completely unite, and wisdom merges with the sphere of reality itsel£ When the basis of thought meets the wisdom mind of primordial purity, everything is liberated into the sphere of reality itself, liberated like waves welling up from the ocean, then dissolving back into it.

Since it is without reference point, it is liberated without fixation. Since it is free of partiality, it is liberated without bias.

Her work includes a translation of Sera Khandro's spiritual biography. I 5 The two teachers mentioned here, Trulshik Rinpoche and Chatral Rinpoche, are widely regarded as two of the m!'st highly realized living Dzogchen yogis. In recent years, both have been instrumental in maintaining and transmitting the Great Perfection lineages. Trulshik Rinpoche, whose main monasteries are located in Solokhurnbu and Kathmandu, Nepal, has been transmitting many important lineages to the reincarnation of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche at Shechen Monastery in Boudhanath, Nepal. Chatral Rinpoche, based in Parping, Nepal and Salbhari, India, has been passing on the lineage of the Dudjom Tersar to the reincarnation ofDudjom Rinpoche, as well as the rare lineage of Sera Khandro to his daughter, Saraswati, who is reputed to be the reincarnation of Sera Khandro. Saraswati has undergone extensive training under her father's guidance and currently serves as his main attendant. I 6 Treasures may be teachings, statues and other blessed objects, or any. other item that is destined to have a positive impact in a particular time and place. Teachings, however, are the most important form of revealed treasures, as they are capable ofleading spiritual aspirants to the state ofbuddhahood. Treasures may be hidden in physical locations or, in the case of teachings, in the mind of a particular student. See note 36 below. I 7 Precedents for both the treasure and pure vision lineages can be found in the annals of the Indian Buddhist tradition. The Five Teachings of Maitreya (Byams chos sde lnga) are perhaps the most well known example of \"pure vision\" teachings. This collection, which includes the famed Unsurpassed Continuum and Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes, was transmitted to the Indian saint &anga by Maitreya in a visionary state. As for treasures, many of the Mahayana Sutras were said to have been \"hidden\" in other realms, such as the Perfection of .Knowledge Sutras that were retrieved from the realm of the nagas by Nagarjuna.

Of those revealed by the former, the aforementioned Heart Essence ofChetsiin deserves special mention, as this particular cycle has spawned an extensive collection of commentarialliterature, including instruction manuals composed by Jamgon Kongtrii.l, Lerab Lingpa (18;6-192.6), and Adzom Drukpa (1842.-192.4). A compilation of these texts was recently published by Shechen Monastery under the title iCe btshun snying thig gi chos skor (see bibliography for more details). Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa was one of the most prolific tercons, with revelations that fill thirty-nine volumes. Among his most well known Dzogchen cycles are the Three Classes ofDzogchen, mentioned in note 8, and the Heart Essence ofSamantabhadra. Dudjom Rinpoche Jigdral Yeshe Dorje and Dilgo Khyentse were also active treasure revealers.

Mahayoga development stage practices also tend to be much more complex and detailed than their Anu and Ati counterparts.

Khenchen Namdrol Rinpochc ofNamdroling Monastery in South India [personal communication, :z.oo4) and Gctse Tulku Rinpochc of Katok Monastery [personal communication, :z.oo7) received this transmission at Larung Gar in Eastern Tibet, though at different times. 46 Padma las 'brd rtsal, Sangs rgyas kyi 'das rjts gsum pa, p. 75· 47 gTer bdag gling pa, mKha' gro snying thig gi khrid yig zab lam gsa/ byed, pp. 52.3-52.5. 48 This pairing of the outer and inner prdiminaries seems to be unique to the Heart Essence lineage. Though there is no reference to this approach in the root texts of the Fourfold Heart Essence, it may be that this was part of the oral explanatory lineage that was not written down. A similar presentation of the prdiminary practices is outlined in Jamgon Kongtriil's Pristine Advice, where the inner preliminaries are linked with the seven-point contemplation that forms the outer preliminaries in the Heart Essence ofVimalamitra. Kongtriil notes that while this approach is not explicitly formulated in the root texts of the Heart Essence ofVimalamitra, the lineage gurus practiced in this manner based on the necessity of inclu~ng a prdiminary step to gather the accumulation of merit (Dri medzhallung, p. 1.43). Since both the Third Dzogchcn Rinpochc andJamgon Kongtriil were heavily influenced by the works ofTerdak Lingpa, it seems likdy that this particular approach has its origins in the Mindroling lineage. . 49 Quoted in dPal sprul 0 rgyan chos kyi dbang po, Kun bzang bla ma'i zhallung, p. 500. 50 Though the structure of these practices varies significantly, from lineage to lineage, the practices themsdves arc presented with remarkable consistency. There arc, however, a few practices where this is not the case. The vajra stance, for example, is practiced sca~cd in some traditions and standing in others. This discrepancy is mentioned in Jigmc Lingpa's Supreme Wzsdom (p. :z.83) and Adzom Drukpa's Essence of Wisdom (p. 549 ). Clarifying the Practice of the Heart Essence from the Northern Treasure lineage provides a further variation in which one performs the posture in a seated position and varies the color of the visualization in cottespondcncc with one's astrological sign (p. 51). Resting in the natural State is also practiced differently in diffcr_cnt traditions. In some presentations, one is instructed to sit in whichever position one finds most comfortable (for example, Terdak Lingpa's rDzogs pa chen po mkha' gro snying thig gi khrid yig zab lam gsa! byed, p. 565), while in others one is instructed to lie down (as in Longchenpa's Khrid yig rin po che gser gyi phreng ba, p. 347 ). 5 1 Essential Instructions states. \"Having rested in the natural state, the nature of the breakthrough, one ~ust then access the nature of the direct leap• [p. 89). Hence, in this presentation the practice of resting in the natural state/ revitalization is clearly considered an integral part of the main practice of breakthrough. In later presentations of Heart Essence practice, these came to be associated primarily with the practice of tranquility and the unique Heart Essence preliminaries, as they precede the stages of analysis and pointing out that precipitate a recognition of the nature of mind.

Among the unique qualities of this instruction manual, it discusses the varying approaches found in Great Perfection literature, as well as providing an extremely thorough presentation of the stages of meditative achievement. 58 Ibid., p. 542..\" While Adzom Drukpa here stresses the importance of practicing the separation of samsara and nirvana in preparation for the path of the direct leap, later in the same text he states that this practice is an inipoctant preliminary for the breakthrough as well [p. 552.]. 59 Jigmc Lingpa's Supreme Wisdom, for example, follows the presentation ofTerdak Lingpa and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche [Ye shes bla ma, pp. 2.77-2.92.]. In The Vajra Essence, a well known Dzogchen treatise from the Dudjom Tersar lineage, all the preliminary practices mentioned here {with the exception of the four element yoga) are listed as preliminaries for the direct leap [Khrag 'thung bdud 'joms rdo rje, gNas lugs rang byung gi rgyud rdo rje'i snyingpo, pp. 2.88-303]. In Buddhahood Placed in the Palm of One's Hand, a widely practiced cycle revealed by Khenchen}igmc Puntsok Rinpoche, the structure of the preliminary practices follows the outline laid out in Longchenpa's Precious Treasury of the Suprtme Vehicle and Precious Treasury ofWords and Their Meanings, where there are three divisions: {r) the physical. verbal, and mental preliminaries that guide the mind {or the three gates), {2.) the yoga of the four elements that guides one to the three kayas, and (3) the separation of samsara and nirvana that guides one to awareness. In this system, all three of these are practiced prior to both the breakthrough and direct leap ['Jigs med phun tshogs, Khrid yig sangs rgyas lag ster gyi zin bris, p. 64 ]. 6o gTer bdag gling pa, mKha' gro snying thig gi lehrid yig zab lam gsal byed, p. 632.. 61 There is also a more complex form of development stage meditation in which numerous groups of deities are visualized, each with a pair of male and female deities at its center: One such example is the set of practices associated with the Eight Sadhana Teachings {sgrub pa bka' brgyad), which comprises the Sadhana Section {sgrub sde) ofMahayoga. 6 2.

The author goes on to explain the importance of this particular empowerment and its relation to breakthrough practice and the nature of mind. Terdak Lingpa, in contrast, links the breakthrough instructions with the word empowerment and the empowerment into the display of awareness with the direct leap (p. 632.]. Unlike the Third Dzogchen Rinpochc, he does not offer a detailed explanation of this empowerment or its relation to the direct leap. 6' gTcr bdaggling pa, mKha' gro snying thig gi lchritJ yig zab lam gsal byed, p. 576 and Nges don bstan 'dzin bzangpo, Shingrta bzangpo, p. 305. . 70 Padma las 'brd rtsal, bTags grol snyingpo'i don lehrid, p. 88. 71 Sec gTcr bdag gling pa, mKha' gro snying thig gi lehrid yig zab lam gsa/ byed, p. 582. and Nges don bstan 'dzin bzang po, Shing rta bzangpo, p. 309. 71 The phrase \"poinring out based on meditative experience\" (nyams myong bsgom pa'i thog ru ngo sprad pa) is not found in the root texts of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis, nor is it addressed in any ofLongchcnpa's numerous commentaries on this cycle. The subdivisions of this topic, however, arc mentioned in the latter's Rosary of Golden jewels, p. 349· In this text, these two divisions (poinring out natural stillness within a state of absorption and pointing out narural radiance as the play of wisdom) comprise the second of three seeps, refining the practice (rtsal sbyang).Thc first and third steps are, respectively, pointing out (ngo sprod) and enhancement (bogs dbyungs). The subdivisions of\"pointing out natural radiance as the play of wisdom\" are discussed more widely in Longchenpa's commentaries. In The]ewelApproach (p. 300 ), Deuneating the Profound (p. 317 ), and .An Ocean ofCloutls of the Profound Nature (p. 354), these pointing out instructions (pointing out stillness to be the adornment of the mind, pointing out movement to be the play of the mind, and pointing out the nonduality of movement and stillness) comprise the main pointing out instructions. Though the format is somewhat different, many of the divisions of breakthrough practice presented here are also discussed by Jamgon Kongtriil in Dri med zhallung, p. 186. As both this text and the Third Dzogchen Rinpoche's Excellent Chariot are rooted in the teachifigs ofTerdak Lingpa, it seems lik~y that this system of pointing out instructions (via (1) the transmission of blessings, (1) the view, and (3) on the basis of meditative experience) stems from the oral lineage received by this master, or was created by him based on the root texts of the Heart Essence of the Dakinis and Longchenpa's Dakini's Quintessence. 73 This introduction, included on pp. ISS-IS6 of the translation that follows, is taken from Longchenpa's Rosary of Golden jewels, pp. 34 7-348. 74 Terdak Lingpa's presentation follows a well-known scheme of dividing the Heart Essence ·teachings into three separate approaches: (x) key instructions for those with great diligence on the outer, inner, and unique preliminaries, followed by the breakthrough and dircctleap, (1) key instructions for those with moderate diligence on the intermediate states, and (3) key instructions for those with the least diligence on the nirmanakaya"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"192. / GREAT PERFECTION pure realms. This approach is taken in many of the most widely studied Heart Essence instruction manuals, such as Jigme Lingpa's Supreme Wudom. 75 The most well-known text used for this latter approach is Karma Lingpa's famed Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Intermediate States, more commonly known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead. This text, which is actually a collection of shott treatises, includes introductions to the nature of mind and to the manifestations of reality itself (associated with breakthrough and direct leap), as well as pointing out instructions that relate to the stages of the death process and the other intermediate states.

The fourth item in this section of the outline, however, \"sealing the importance of the transmission,\" docs not appear to cottespond to a later section of The Excelknt Chariot. In Terdak Lingpa's text, this brief chapter states the impottance of transmitting the teachings to qualified students and invokes the Dharma protectors and guardians to watch over them and maintain their purity [gTer bdag gling pa, pp. 631-63s]. 8 I The Three Last Testaments of the Buddha are found in two sections of the Fourfold Heart Essence. There are three sections, each of which contains key instructions that were taught by the buddha Vajra~ara directly to Garap Dorje. These instructions arc contained in both the Heart Essence of the Dakinis and the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra. In the latter, however, a number of pithy texts are added that contain the intructions transmitted by Garap Dorje and the subsequent lineage masters to their closest students. This group of texts includes some of the most famous teachings of the Great Perfection tradition, such as Three Statements That Strike the Vstal Point, the teaching that Garap Dorje passed on to Manjushrimitra.

Ordinarily, this term refers to the stage of one's practice where a certain degree of proficiency in meditation has been attained, and on~ then uses certain practices to further refine one's ability. In this sense, the term is similar to another commonly used term, hoke dOn (bogs 'don), which is commonly translated as \"to enhance: [one's practice]: In this context, however, the first part of this term, tsel, takes on a special meaning, as this is also the term most frequently used to refer to the expression, or display, of awareness-rik pey tsel (rig pa'i rtsal). Hence, when combined with the word jang, this term can also be taken tom~ \"to refine away (sbyang) the display (rtsal) [of awareness]; referring to the fact that in this practice one: uses the HUM syllable to effectively insubstantialize all the external and internal appearances that manifest as the display of awareness. Nonetheless, it also has the sense of advancing one's practice and refining one's meditative capability, as it builds upon and enhances the first stage of the verbal prdiminaries.

Based on the nonobservation of an apprehended object, the nonobservation of any apprehending subject also occurs. Therefore, since there are no objects to be observed, the mind associated with [this] observation is established as the very nature of nonobservation, for when there are no objects to be observed there cannot be any observer.

Like all religions and cultures, Tibetan Buddhism has seen its fair share of sectarian strife and turmoil. The Rime movement aimed to counter this tendency by promoting an atmosphere of harmony and goodwill between the various Buddhist schools and lineages of Tibet. Rime is not a school or sect of Buddhism, but a unique approach to spiritual practice. Adher-ents of this outlook are often rooted in one spiritual tradition. At the same time, however, they maintain a respect for, and willingness to learn from, other approaches. The Rime ideal, then, is not to create one \"universal approach\" to spirituality, but rather to honor the differences between lin-. eages, sects, and religions, and to foster an environment of mutual support and harmony. The vision of the Rime Foundation is a world in which wisdom and compassion are the guiding forces in our individual and collective lives, and in which the traditions that enable us to cultivate virtue are honored, practiced, and preserved for future generations. Our mission is to facilitate this process by preserving the spiritual heritage of Tibet, providing access to its texts, teacherS', and practices, and fostering the growth of a diverse and tolerant spiritual community. .
