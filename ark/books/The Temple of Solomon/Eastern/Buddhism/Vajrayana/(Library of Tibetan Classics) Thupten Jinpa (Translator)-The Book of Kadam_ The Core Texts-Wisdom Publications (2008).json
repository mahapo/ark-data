Eventually comprising thirty-two large volumes, the collec­tion will contain over two hundred distinct texts by more than a hundred of the best- known Tibetan authors. These texts have been selected in consultation with the preeminent lineage holders of all the schools and other senior Tibetan scholars to repre­sent the Tibetan literary tradition as a whole. The works included in the series span more than a millennium and cover the vast expanse of classical Tibetan knowledge— from the core teachings of the specific schools to such diverse fields as ethics, philosophy, psy­chology, Buddhist teachings and meditative practices, civic and social responsibilities, linguistics, medicine, astronomy and astrology, folklore, and historiography.T he Book o fK a d a m : The Core TextsThe Kadam school, which emerged from the teachings of the Indian master Atisa and his principal student, Dromtönpa, is revered for its unique practical application of the bodhisattvas altruistic ideal in day-to-day life. One of the most well-known sets of spir­itual teachings stemming from Atis'a and Dromtönpa is a special collection of oral trans­missions enshrined in the two-volume Book o fK a d a m (B k a ‘ gdam s glegs bam ). The texts presented here include the core texts of The Book o fK a d a m , notably the twenty-three- chapter dialogue between Atis'a and Dromtönpa that is woven around Atibas B o d h i- sattva’s Je w e l G arland, Sometimes referred to as the “Kadam emanation scripture,” The Book o fK a d a m is undisputedly one of the greatest works of Tibetan Buddhism.

As evidenced from the historical writings, this flowering of Buddhist tradition in the country brought about the fulfillment of the deep spiritual aspirations of countless sentient beings. In particular, it con­tributed to the inner peace and tranquility of the peoples ofTibet, Outer Mongolia—a country historically suffused with Tibetan Buddhism and its culture— the Tuva and Kalmuk regions in present-day Russia, the outer regions of mainland China, and the entire trans-Himalayan areas on the southern side, including Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Kinnaur, and Spiti. Today this tradition of Buddhism has the potential to make significant contributions to the welfare of the entire human family. I have no doubt that, when combined with the methods and insights of modern science, the Tibetan Buddhist cultural heritage and knowledge will help foster a more enlightened and compassionate human society, a humanity that is at peace with itself, with fellow sentient beings, and with the natural world at large.It is for this reason I am delighted that the Institute of Tibetan Classics in Montreal, Canada, is compiling a thirty-two volume series containing the works of many great Tibetan teachers, philosophers, scholars, and prac­titioners representing all major Tibetan schools and traditions. These important writings will be critically edited and annotated and will then be published in modern book format in a reference collection called The Library o f Tibetan Classics, with their translations into other major lan­guages to be followed later.

The volume contains some of the most important texts of the Tibetan Bud­dhist tradition translated for the first time ever in any secondary language. Attributed to the eleventh-century Indian Bengali master Atis'a and his prin­ciple disciple Dromtönpa, The Book o f Kadam—the original two-volume Tibetan collection that is the basis of our volume— contains a series of poignant exchanges between two luminaries of Tibetan Buddhism on all the important themes of spiritual awakening. From the basic training in guarding the gateway of our senses and seeking an appropriate environ­ment in which to live to such advanced meditative practices as the sophis­ticated visualization of the mandala of the so-called sixteen drops, and from somber instructions on how to prepare our mind for death to the detailed contemplations on the twelve links of dependent origination and the cul­tivation of a compassionate heart, the dialogues reproduced here bring a personal approach to the path to full enlightenment. Sometimes known also as “the miraculous book of Kadam” (bka‘ gdams sprul p a ’i glegs bam) because of its origination as a “revealed” text, The Book o f Kadam is today revered as sacred by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. One of the major legacies of the book was the embracing throughout Tibet of Avalokitesvara (the buddha of compassion) and the goddess Tara (the buddha of enlight­ened activities) as special divinities connected to Tibet, laying the founda­tion for what later came to be the institution of the Dalai Lamas.The present volume contains the core texts of The Book o f Kadam along with three supplemental texts to help the reader better understand how the collection was historically viewed and practiced.Two primary objectives have driven the creation and development of The Library o f Tibetan Classics. The first aim is to help revitalize the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv T h e B o o k o fK a d a mappreciation and the study of the Tibetan classical heritage within Tibetan­speaking communities worldwide. The younger generation in particular struggle with the tension between traditional Tibetan culture and the real­ities of modern consumerism. To this end, efforts have been made to develop a comprehensive yet manageable body of texts, one that features the works of Tibet’s best-known authors and covers the gamut of classical Tibetan knowledge. The second objective of The Library o f Tibetan Clas­sics is to help make these texts part of global literary and intellectual her­itage. In this regard, we have tried to make the English translation reader-friendly and, as much as possible, keep the body of the text free of scholarly apparatus, which can intimidate general readers. For specialists who wish to compare the translation with the Tibetan original, page refer­ences of the critical edition of the Tibetan text are provided in brackets.The texts in this thirty-two-volume series span more than a millen­nium— from the development of the Tibetan script in the seventh century to the first part of the twentieth century, when Tibetan society and culture first encountered industrial modernity. The volumes are thematically organized and cover many of the categories of classical Tibetan knowl­edge— from the teachings specific to each Tibetan school to the classical works on philosophy, psychology, and phenomenology. The first category includes teachings of the Kadam, Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyii, Geluk, and Jonang schools, of miscellaneous Buddhist lineages, and of the Bön school. The texts in these volumes were selected in consultation with the senior lineage holders of the individual schools. The texts in the other categories were selected based on the historical reality of the particular disciplines. For example, the volume on epistemology contains works from the Sakya and Geluk schools, while the volume on buddha nature features the writings of Butön Rinchen Drup and various Kagyxi masters. Where fields are of more common interest, such as the three codes or the bodhisattva ideal, efforts have been made to represent the perspectives of each of the four major schools. The Library o f Tibetan Classics can function as a comprehensive library of the Tibetan literary heritage for libraries, educational and cultural institutions, and interested individuals.It has been a joy and privilege for me to undertake this translation proj­ect and thus to have the opportunity to offer to the world some of the most precious jewels of the Tibetan tradition. I wish first to express my deep per­sonal gratitude to His Holiness the Dalai Lama for always being such a pro­found source of inspiration.

It is their support that also has enabled me per­sonally to work fulltime on translations of key classical Tibetan texts, such as those contained in the present volume, a pursuit that I greatly enjoy and care about.I owe deep gratitude to several individuals and organizations. The Cen­tral Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies in Sarnath provided full access to its library to the Tibetan editors, including myself, who worked on the crit­ical editions of the Tibetan texts translated in this volume. Gene Smith at the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center helped in obtaining crucial Tibetan texts needed for the editing of the Tibetan texts as well as for my own research. My wife Sophie Boyer-Langri took on with warmth and dedica­tion the numerous administrative chores that are part of a collaborative project such as The Library o f Tibetan Classics. Finally, I thank my two edi­tors, Amy Miller and David Kittlestrom at Wisdom Publications, whose careful copyediting brought much clarity to the English text, thus making its reading more joyful. It is my sincere hope that the translations offered in this volume will benefit many people.

They are Avalokitesvara, the buddha of compassion whom Tibetans rev­erently call Chenresik (“the lord who gazes at beings with his eyes”), and Tärä (Drölma, “the savioress”). These two deities are renowned through­out the Tibetan Buddhist cultural sphere— from easternmost Tibet, which borders China proper, to the western regions near Ladakh, Kashmir, and Pakistan, and from Central Asia in the north to the trans-Himalayan regions of the Indian subcontinent in the south. AvalokiteSvara’s famous six-syllable mantra, om m anipadm e hüm, is so ubiquitous throughout the Tibetan cultural sphere that it may be one of the most-repeated strings of letters in human history. The Tibetans’ deep devotion to Avalokitesvara is never complete, however, without their affection for goddess Tara, his partner in caring for and saving the world. Just as every devout Tibetan knows and recites the famous six-syllable mantra, so, too, most of them know and chant hymns to the twenty-one Taras. Similarly, where one finds an icon of Avalokitesvara, one also likely finds an icon ofTärä in her distinctive posture, seated with her left leg folded and right leg extended. With her two hands in the teaching gesture, or mudra, she holds in her right fingers the stem of a blue lotus that blooms near her right shoulder."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Inextricably linked with the flourishing of Avalokitesvara and Tara wor­ship in Tibet is the story of the Bengali master Atis'a Dipamkara (982- 1054) and his interaction with his principal Tibetan disciple Dromtön Gyalwai Jungné (1005-64), the subject of The Book ofK adam , or simply “the book.”According to traditional biographies of Atis'a, as conveyed through Gya Tsöndrü Sengé (eleventh century) and, later, Naktso Lotsäwa Tsültrim Gyalwa (1011-64), h was at Tara’s urging that the Indian master finally accepted the persistent invitations of the Ngari rulers in Tibet. It was also Tara who, according to tradition, prophesized Atis'a’s meeting with his spir­itual heir, Dromtönpa. As we see in the epigraph above, Tärä also offered her solemn pledge to protect all those who follow Avalokites'vara, who the book identifies with Dromtönpa himself. These and many other aspects of the story of Atisa’s coming to Tibet— his devotion to Avalokitesvara and Tara, and, more importantly, his special relationship with Dromtönpa— left a lasting imprint upon the Tibetan people and the fate of Buddhism in Tibet. Soon after Master AtiSa’s death in 1054, and especially after Drom- tönpa’s founding of Radreng Monastery not far from the Tibetan capital city of Lhasa in 1056, the followers of this Bengali master came to be iden­tified as the Kadam school. The epithet kadam (hka gdams) distinguishes its followers as those who understand the sacred words of the Buddha in terms of AtiSa’s instructions.Perhaps the most important legacy of the book, at least for the Tibetan people as a whole, is that it laid the foundation for the later identification of Avalokitesvara with the lineage of the Dalai Lama, who continually enacts the solemn pledge of this compassionate deity to accord special care for the people of the “Land of Snows.” Although Avalokitesvara was pro­pitiated in Tibet before the tenth century, and although the designation of the seventh-century Tibetan emperor, Songtsen Gampo, as an embodi­ment of Avalokitesvara most probably predates Atis'a’s arrival in Tibet, the available textual evidence points strongly toward the eleventh and twelfth centuries as the period during which the full myth of Avalokites'vara’s spe­cial destiny with Tibet was established. During this era, the belief that this compassionate spirit intervenes in the fate of the Tibetan people by mani­festing as benevolent rulers and teachers took firm root.2 It is also becom­ing increasingly clear that Atis'a played a crucial role in the propagation, if not development, of the key elements of these myths. The story of the The Book o f Kadam is part of that overall story, one that indelibly shaped the2 T h e B o o k o fK a d a m"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 3self-identity of the Tibetan people and their understanding of Tibet’s place in the world.3M aster Atisa an d H is Teaching LegacyAtis'a came to Tibet in the summer of the water-horse year, 1042, first to the kingdom of Ngari in western Tibet. For the Tibetans this was an occa­sion for celebration, as it marked the culmination of years of sacrifice of both personal and material resources aimed at bringing an Indian master of such stature to Tibet. On the Nepalese side of the border, the master was received by a welcoming party of around three hundred horsemen from Tibet, recalling the Tibetan reception of the grand abbot Säntaraksita sev­eral centuries earlier.4 By then, Atis'a must already have been familiar with the historical outline of Tibet’s conversion to Buddhism: the role of the famous Indian Buddhist philosopher Säntaraksita, especially his introduc­tion of the monastic order; the founding of the first monastery, Samyé; and the early Tibetan translators’ efforts in transmitting classical Buddhist texts. According to the traditional hagiographical sources, Atis'a was explic­itly invited to “revive” and “restore” the Buddhadharma ia Tibet in the wake of its “adulteration” with all sorts of misconceptions—both deliber­ate and out of ignorance—of the scriptures, especially those of the esoteric Vajrayana class.It is telling that when the Ngari ruler Lha Jangchup Ö requested Atis'a for a formal teaching, as attested in the colophon to Atis'a’s Lam p fo r the Path to Enlightenm ent (Bodhipathapradipa), the Tibetan ruler asked for a teaching that would be beneficial for the survival of the Buddhadharma as a whole. According to one source, Jangchup Ö made the following plea: “Instead of some so-called profound or amazing teachings, pray sus­tain us in the land of Tibet with the teaching of karma and its effects,” to which the master replied with great delight, “The law of karma and its effects alone is the most profound teaching.”5 Then, recounting several tales of how even some advanced yogis who had experienced visions of their meditation deities suffered grave consequences as a result of defy­ing the law of karma, Atisa is said to have consented to nurture the peo­ple of Tibet with teachings on karma. In this way, Atisa came to be known, in addition to his previous appellation as the “teacher of awak­ening mind,” as the “teacher of karma and its effects.”6 Thus began Atis'a’s mission in Tibet."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mAtisa is perhaps revered most for his genius in distilling the essence of all the teachings of the Buddha within the framework of a single aspirants path. His Lamp fo r the Path to Enlightenment organizes the entire corpus of the Buddhist teachings into what he calls the practices relevant to “the per­sons of three scopes” or “three capacities”— initial, intermediate, and great. This revolutionary approach enabled the Tibetans to understand the het­erogeneous literature of the Indian Buddhist sources in their appropriate contexts and to integrate that knowledge meaningfully within meditative practice. Over time an entire genre of literature evolved in Tibet on the basis of Atisa’s seminal works, collectively known as stages o f the path or lamrim. A key feature of the lamrim texts is their graduated approach to the Buddhist path. Within this genre are two broad subdivisions, namely: (i) lamrim proper, the texts that stay close to the three capacities schema of Atis'a’s Lamp, and (2) stages o f the doctrine (tenrim), the texts that empha­size understanding the diverse elements of the doctrine within the larger framework of the Buddha’s teaching.7The earliest examples of lamrim texts are notes based on Naktso Lotsä- was teachings, Potowas (1027-1105) Blue Udder and Teaching in Similes, as well as various notes drawn from Neusurpa’s instructions.8 Gönpawa Wangchuk Gyaltsen (1016-82) is said to have composed a lamrim based on the teachings he received directly from Atiáa, and there also appears to have been a lamrim by Ngok Lekpai Sherap (1018-1115)9 based on Khutön Tsön- drii Yungdrung’s (ion-75) teachings. Following Tsongkhapa’s (1357-1419) composition of the influential classic, The Great Treatise on the Stages o f the Path to Enlightenment, not only did the stages of the path become a defin­ing mark of the Geluk school, but the very term lamrim came to be almost equivalent to Tsongkhapas texts on the subject.10 As for the stages of the doctrine genre, perhaps the earliest work is Ngok Lekpai Sherap’s Six Stan­zas on the Stages o f the Doctrine11 and its commentarial expositions, espe­cially those of Ngok Loden Sherap (1059-1109) and his student Drolungpa (eleventh-twelfth centuries), the latter composing the monumental Great Treatise on the Stages o f the Doctrine. In addition there are the various notes scribed on the basis of Laksorpa’s teachings as well as Naljorpa’s (eleventh century) Instructions on the Entering and Departing Cyclic Existence.'1The second genre of literature that evolved in Tibet from Atiia’s teach­ings is the cycle of m ind training (lojong) texts, the most well known of which are Atis'a’s own Bodhisattva’s Jew el Garland (reproduced in this vol­ume), Langri Thangpa’s (1054-1123) Eight Verses on M in d Training, and the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 5Seven-Point M in d Training, which is traditionally attributed to Chekawa (1101-75). I have argued elsewhere that the origin of the Tibetan mind training teachings may well have been a compilation of pithy sayings Mas­ter Atis'a spoke to different people on different occasions.13 The focal point of mind training teachings is the cultivation of the awakening mind ( bodhi- citta), especially in the tradition of Sântideva’s (eighth century) equalizing and exchanging self and others. Furthermore, unlike the stages of the path teachings, mind training emphasizes the use of pithy sayings and a direct approach in dealing with the obstacles to developing the awakening mind. A central element in the mind training teachings is the commemoration of Atis'a’s long journey to the Indonesian island of Sumatra and his special rev­erence for the master he met there, Serlingpa, his principal teacher on the awakening mind.Early historical and biographical sources also show that Atis'a not only taught important Indian Buddhist philosophical classics, especially Bhâva- vivekas (fifth century) Blaze o f Reasoning, an exposition of Nâgârjunas (sec­ond century) Fundam ental Wisdom o f the M iddle Way, he also composed philosophical works of his own, especially on the subject of the Middle Way doctrine of emptiness. The Indian masters philosophical legacy was ensured when one of his key Tibetan disciples, Ngok Lekpai Sherap, founded Sangphu Monastery, which soon became the most important cen­ter of philosophical learning in Tibet. This was followed by the founding of yet another important philosophical center of learning— namely, Narthang Monastery, established in 1153 by Tumtön Lodrö Drak (ca. 1106-66). These two monastic centers came to dominate the study of clas­sical Indian Buddhist learning, especially in epistemology, Abhidharma psychology and phenomenology, the scholastic inquiry into the perfection of wisdom literature, and the Middle Way philosophy of emptiness.Atis'a also wrote extensively on Buddhist Vajrayana practice, including ritual and meditation texts on the meditation deities Guhyasamäja, Cakra- samvara, Avalokites'vara, and Tärä. He penned evocative tantric diamond songs, some of which echo the metaphors, themes, and emotive tones of the well-known dohä cycles of songs attributed to the Indian Buddhist mystic Saraha (ca. tenth century).14 Today, most Tibetan Buddhist schools have numerous lineages of Vajrayana practice that trace their transmission to Atis'a. Perhaps Atis'a’s greatest contribution to Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet is his personal involvement in the translation into Tibetan of many important Indian Vajrayana texts.15"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mThe Blue Annals contains a curious remark regarding Atis'a’s Vajrayana legacy purportedly uttered by Tibet’s beloved poet-saint Milarepa to his disciple Gampopa (1079-1153): “Although the Kadampas [i.e., Kadam fol­lowers] have essential instructions (dam ngag), they possess no oral instruc­tions (man ngag). A demon must have possessed Tibetans’ hearts, preventing Master Atiáa from teaching secret mantra, for had he been allowed to, Tibet would today be filled with accomplished adepts.”16 We also find in Chim Namkha Drak’s (1210-85) Biography o f Master Atisa a passage dealing with this supposed barring of Atis'a from teaching secret mantra in Tibet. In response to Drom’s request not to establish a new monastic line of the Mahisamghika order, Atis'a is reported as speaking in exasperation, “I have no authority to teach the secret mantra vows or the dohä [cycle of] dia­mond songs. If I neither have the authority to establish a monastic line, then my journey to Tibet has been pointless!”17In general, I do not think the available textual evidence suggests Drom- tönpa prevented Atis'a from teaching Vajrayana; if anything, the sources indicate otherwise. Not only is Drom listed in the lineage of the transmis­sion of several Vajrayana practices stemming from Atisa, especially those that relate to Avalokiteávara, Drom also appears to have helped translate some of these Vajrayana texts into Tibetan. It does seem, however, that Drom may have discouraged Atiáa, and especially his immediate disciples, from disseminating too publicly the teachings belonging to the so-called mother tan tras. In doing so, not only was Drom following in the noble tra­dition of the early Tibetan monarchs, who imposed restrictions on the dis­semination of the highest yoga class of tantra, but also, more importantly, he may have been keeping vigilant about one of the express purposes of bringing Atis'a to Tibet— to help reform and restore the Buddhadharma in light of the misconstrual and abuse of some Vajrayana teachings, especially sexual practices.Perhaps the most intriguing set of teachings that traces its origin to Mas­ter Atis'a is the collection enshrined in two large volumes known together as The Book ofKadam , excerpts of which are translated in the present vol­ume. This cycle of texts, as I’ve noted, relates Atis'a’s special relationship with his spiritual heir, Dromtönpa, and highlights many of the more mys­tical aspects of Atisa’s legacy in Tibet, especially his veneration of Avalo- kites'vara and his propitiation of Tara. Known as Atis'a and Dromtönpa’s “secret teachings” (gsang chos), they outline a unique practice called the sev­enfold divinity and teaching. This teaching is centered on the choice of four"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 7meditation deities— (1) the Buddha as the teacher, (2) Avalokites'vara as the deity of compassion, (3) Tärä as the goddess of enlightened action, and (4) Acala as the protector guardian— and the three scriptural baskets of dis­cipline, knowledge, and meditation. This set of teachings is significant in the ways it creates a shift in focus. For example, with respect to the teacher, the focus of importance shifts from Master Ati¿a to Dromtönpa; with respect to land, it shifts from India as the land of Dharma to Tibet as a place of special significance connected with Avalokiteávara; and with regard to teachings, the focus shifts from the teaching of classical Indian scriptures and treatises to the direct and oral teachings of the masters, especially as revealed in mystic visionary states. Even in the style of language employed, there is a shift from classical composition to a more informal style, with greater use of vernacular Tibetan.The Kadam TraditionThe Tibetan followers of the Indian master found a locus for their iden­tification as members of a distinct community when Dromtönpa founded Radreng Monastery in 1056, about two years after Atis'a’s death. These members came to decribe themselves as the Kadampas, a designation com­posed of two words covering a wide semantic range— ka (bkd) refers to sacred words or speech, and dam (gdams or dam) can refer either to advice and instruction, or to the verbs “to bind” and “to choose.” Lechen Künga Gyaltsen, a fifteenth-century historian of Kadam, offers four different explanations.18 First, Kadam may be defined as “those who integrate the essence of the entire three baskets of Buddhist scripture within the frame­work of the path of the three scopes and for whom all the scriptures of the Buddha appear as personal instructions.” This interpretation is said to be based on the following statement attributed to Dromtönpa:The wondrous sacred words are the three baskets of scripture,Which are enriched by the instructions on [the path of] the three capacities.This precious Kadam [tradition] is a golden rosary,And those who count its beads make their lives meaningful.15According to the second interpretation of the meaning of Kadam, the tradition is so called “because the founding father of Kadam, Dromtönpa,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mchose, in accordance with the sacred instruction of Master Atiáa, the sev­enfold divinity and teaching as his principal practice.” A third interpreta­tion is that when Master Atiáa was residing at Nyethang, his disciples accorded great authority to his sacred words, so they came to be known as “Kadampas,” who hold the sacred words as binding. The final interpreta­tion is that the Kadampas are guided by the three baskets of scripture in their overall Dharma practice and approach Vajrayana teachings and prac­tices circumspectly.On the other hand, TsuklakTrengwa, the author of the well-known his­torical work A Feast fo r the Learned, identifies two meanings of the term and states that both of these interpretations can be found in The Book o f Kadam. The first is that they are so-called because they uphold the Bud­dha’s sacred words as personal instructions. Second, in that Dromtönpa selected the four divinities as meditation deities and the two awakening minds as the main practice, his followers were called Kadampas.20Atis'a’s Tibetan disciples include most Tibetan masters of the period. Among them, three stand out as his principal students in central Tibet. Known as “the trio Khu, Ngok, and Drom,” they are, respectively: Khutön Tsöndrü Yungdrung, Ngok Lepai Sherap, and Dromtönpa. Most early sources agree that it was Dromtönpa who, as prophesized by Tara, became Atisa’s chosen heir and thereby effectively the founder of the Kadam school. Over time Atis'a’s other students became Dromtönpa’s students as well. Chief among Dromtönpas students were the “three Kadam brothers”— Potowa Rinchen Sal, ChengawaTsültrim Bar (1033-1103), and Phu-chungwa Shönu Gyaltsen (1031-1106)—who effectively came to be recognized as “the entrusted holders of the lineage” (bka’ babs kyi brgyud ’dzin). Potowa became the entrusted custodian of Atis'a’s teachings on the authoritative treatises (gzhung), while Chengawa became the custodian of the teachings embod­ied in the essential instructions (gdams ngag).1' Sometimes, Phuchungwa is listed as a third entrusted custodian and is seen as responsible for the “Kadam lineage of oral instructions” (man ngag) as embodied in The Book o f Kadam. Other authors distinguish the following three lineages in the transmission of Atis'a and Dromtönpa’s Kadam teachings: (1) the Kadam lineage of authoritative treatises stemming from Potowa, (2) the Kadam lin­eage of essential instructions stemming from Chengawa, and (3) the Kadam lineage of the stages of the path stemming from Gönpawa.22Potowa’s Kadam lineage of authoritative treatises emphasizes the approach of grounding all of Master Atis'a and Dromtönpa’s spiritual legacy, especially"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 9the study and practice of Adías seminal work Lamp fo r the Path to Enlight­enment, in a close study of what came to be called the “six authoritative treatises of Kadam.” They are: (i) Asanga’s (fourth century) Bodhisattva Levels, (2) Maitreya’s (ca. fourth century) Ornament o f Mahayana Sutras,(3) Sanddeva’s (eighth century) Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way o f L ife and(4) Compendium o f Trainings, (5) Aryas'üras (ca. fourth century) G arland o f Birth Stories, and (6) the Collection o f Aphorisms, attributed to the histori­cal Buddha. The studies of these treatises are complemented with further Indian Buddhist classics like Nägärjuna’s (second century) Fundam ental Wisdom o f the M iddle Way, his Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness, and Atis'a’s Entry into the Two Truths and An Instruction on the M iddle Way. In contrast, Chengawa’s Kadam lineage of essential instructions emphasizes an approach whereby Adías essential instructions, rather than classical trea­tises, are the key basis for practice. These instructions include the guide on the four truths as transmitted through Chengawa, the guide on the two truths as transmitted through Naljorpa, and the guide on dependent orig­ination as transmitted through Phuchungwa. Finally, the Kadam lineage of oral transmissions as enshrined in The Book o f Kadam was transmitted through Phuchungwa.The fifteenth-century Kadam historian Sonarn Lhai Wangpo lists the following lineages of Master Atis'a’s teachings: (1) Atis'a’s teachings as trans­mitted through his chosen heir, Dromtönpa, based at Radreng, which then branches into the three well-known Kadam lineages of: (i) authorative trea­tises stemming from Potowa, (ii) essential instructions stemming from Chengawa, and (iii) stages of the path teachings stemming either from Gönpawa or from Naktso Lotsäwa and Laksorwa; (2) Adías teaching legacy as transmitted through Ngok Lekpai Sherap, which branches into two main strands: (i) the Sangphu lineage as transmitted through the famed transla­tor Loden Sherap, and (ii) the lineage of The Book o f Kadam as transmitted through Sherap Gyaltsen; and (3) Atis'a’s legacy as transmitted through Nak­tso Lotsäwa, whose main successor was Laksorwa. It was through Lak- sorwa’s main disciple, Jayiilwa (the founder of Jayiil Monastery), that the transmissions of Atis'a’s biographical works as well as instructions on the stages of the path flourished. Naktso’s lineage also includes transmissions of Atis'a’s teachings on the highest yoga class of tantra, such as Guhyasamäja and on various aspects of Avalokites'vara pracuce.23In summing up the influence of the Kadam tradition on Tibetan Bud­dhism as a whole, the author of the influential Blue Annals states:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"io T h e B o o k o f K a d a mIn general, during Master Atis'a’s thirteen years in Tibet, a vast number received essential instructions from him and attained higher qualities [of Dharma] ; their precise number cannot be calculated. In Tsang is the trio Gar, Gö, and Yöl, while in cen­tral Tibet is the trio Khu, Ngok, and Drom. These are [masters] with great fame. Here, however, I have given a broad account of the spiritual mentors whose lineage stems from Drom and [whose names] I have seen myself. Otherwise, in most of the biographies of spiritual mentors who had appeared in Tibet sub­sequently as well as the yogis who have engaged in the life of an adept, they all appeared to have studied at the feet of a Kadam spiritual mentor. Therefore, Drom was someone whose enlight­ened activities were extensive and long lasting.24One intriguing issue in the history of the Kadam school is its disap­pearance. Although more research is needed to confirm this, it seems that by the end of sixteenth century, Kadam effectively ceased to be a distinct school. This may partly be due to the tremendous success of the custo­dians of Atiáa and Dromtönpa’s teachings, on account of which all the key elements of the Kadam teachings became incorporated into the teachings of the other Tibetan schools. Partly, it may be the result of the rapid growth of Tsongkhapa’s “new Kadam school,” whose followers came to be known as Gandenpa (Gelukpa), named after Ganden Monastery, founded in 1409. We know, for example, that over time the different colleges of Kadam’s famous philosophical monastery, Sangphu, came to be run by the Sakya or the Geluk school.25 In addition, accord­ing to one eighteenth-century source, many of the Kadam monasteries had turned into nunneries, although Radreng and Narthang survived as Kadam monasteries.26The Book o f KadamIn its present version, the heart of The Book o f Kadam is two distinct but interrelated sets of teachings, enshrined in volumes 1 and 2, respectively. The first is the Father Teachings, so called because the teachings contained therein were given in response to questions posed to Master Atis'a by father Dromtönpa, while the second is the Son Teachings, teachings given in response to questions posed by Atiia and Drom’s spiritual sons, Ngok"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction ilLekpai Sherap and Khutön Tsöndrü Yungdrung. On one level, the so- called Book ofKadam can be viewed as an extended commentary on a stan­dard Indian Buddhist work, albeit one composed in Tibet. Here I am referring to Atis'a’s Bodhisattva’s Jew el Garland, twenty-six stanzas that ostensibly outline the outlook and practices of a bodhisattva, a buddha-to- be who dedicates his or her entire being to the altruistic ideal of bringing about others’ welfare. In fact, the core of the book, both the Father Teach­ings and the Son Teachings, is framed as instructions, comments, and reflections on specific lines of Bodhisattva’s Jew el G arlandFor instance, The Jew el G arland o f Dialogues, the core text of the Father Teachings, consists of twenty-three chapters, each citing a specific section of Atisa’s root text as a conclusion and sometimes as an opening state­ment as well. The Son Teachings, a collection of Stories of Dromtönpa’s former lives, is reminiscent of the well-known Jdtaka Tales, the Buddhas birth stories.27 Each chapter opens with a citation of a passage from the root text and a request— from Ngok Lekpai Sherap, in the case of the first twenty chapters, and from Khutön, in the case of the last two chapters— on how to relate the cited passage to Dromtönpa’s past lives. However, to view the core texts of the book as a standard text commentary would miss the point about these teachings. At best, Atis'a’s root text is like a spring­board, a literary device to trigger a whole host of issues pertaining to Bud­dhist thought and practice in Tibet. Of special focus for the Father Teachings is the critical question of how to balance and integrate the foun­dational Mahayana teachings with the esoteric Vajrayana practices. The Son Teachings, on the other hand, deal primarily with Dromtönpa’s iden­tification with Avalokites'vara and the latter’s special affinity with the Land of Snows.The literary style of the first thirteen chapters of the Father Teachings maintains a consistent eight-syllable or seven-syllable verse with an occa­sional sojourn into explanatory prose, which often indicates important stages in the dialogue between Atis'a and Dromtönpa. Though retaining a strong oral flavor, these chapters contain some of the most evocative liter­ary verses found in Tibetan literature. They are vibrant, immediate, poignant, and convey a profound spirituality. Often, they are tinged with a wonderful humor and irony. The verses are most evocative when address­ing the ever-present theme of the illusion-like nature of reality. The use of puns, iteration, paradoxes, and other literary devices suggests that the verses are authentic creations of a native speaker (or speakers). Chapter 14"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mbegins with an explicit change of voice: “Now the time has come to speak in plain vernacular Tibetan.” The chapter then proceeds with rapid verbal exchanges back and forth between Atis'a and Dromtönpa, where most of the exchanges are one-line sentences, a style maintained in both chapters 14 and 15. Chapter 16 is a mixture of verse, one-line exchanges, and repet­itive passages in prose giving an idealized image of the landscape around Yerpa, the site where the dialogues supposedly took place. The remaining chapters return somewhat to the original style of eight- or seven-syllable verses. Each chapter ends with Dromtönpa summarizing the exchanges in a series of questions and answers, citing relevant lines from Bodhisattva’s Jew el Garland.The literary format for the Son Teachings is very different. Although invoking the Buddhas famous Jätaka Tales, each birth story begins with a stanza from Bodhisattva's Jew el Garland followed by a request by Ngok (or, in two cases, Khutön) to recount the story of a former life of Dromtönpa in relation to the cited stanza. Although written mostly in prose, the chap­ters often contain memorable verses as well.A Summary o f the Father a n d Son TeachingsThe Fath er Teach in g sThe heart of the meditative practice presented in the Father Teachings is known as the practice of the fiv e recollections, an instruction encapsulated in the following verse attributed to Tara:Recall your teachers, the source of refuge;See your body in the nature of meditation deities;With speech, make your mantra recitations constant;Contemplate all beings as your parents;Experience the nature of your mind as empty.On the basis of these five factors,Make pure all roots of virtue.28These five recollections are presented in the book as unfolding as follows: by reflecting upon the enlightened examples of your teachers, profound feelings of admiration and devotion arise from your very depths such that even the hairs on your body stand on end. On this basis, next you, together with all sentient beings, go for refuge to the Three Jewels and ensure that"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 13you will never be separated from the practice of the deity yoga whereby you arise as the mandatas of the four divinities— the Buddha, Avalokiteávara, Acala, andTärä. Then, on the basis of contemplating all beings as your kind parents, you generate the awakening mind for the benefit of these beings and abide in die meditative equipoise (samädhi) of the ultimate awakening mind, wherein emptiness and compassion are fused in nondual unity. In the periods subsequent to the actual meditation sessions, you then culti­vate the perspective of seeing all phenomena, including your own self, as illusion-like, as seemingly real yet devoid of any substantiality.The book begins in chapter 1 with a string of salutations to the masters of the three principal lineages— the profound view of emptiness stemming from Mañjusri and Nägärjuna, the vast practices stemming from Maitreya and Asañga, and the inspirational blessings stemming from Vajradhara and Saraha— up to the key teachers of Atis'a. In chapter 2, Atis'a then specifies his preferred divinities in the context of the second recollection—recalling one’s body as divinities—and makes the well-known selection of Buddha, Acala, Avalokitesvara, and Tara as the four gods of Kadam. At one point in the text, in the course of conversations between Atis'a and Dromtönpa on the four divinities, Dromtönpa’s heart opens up and miraculously reveals progressively the entire realm of the Buddha Säkyamuni, the realm of Ava­lokitesvara, the realm of Tara, and finally the realm of Acala. It is here that we also find explicit mention of Avalokites'vara’s famous six-syllable man­tra, om m ani padm e hüm.This deity yoga, in its developed form, came to be referred to as the prac­tice of the sixteen drops, which is explained in some detail in Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsens Elucidation o f the Heart-Drop Practice (entry IV in part 1 of this volume). The sixteen drops are: 11. The drop of the outer inconceivable array2. The drop of this Endurance World3. The drop of the realm of Tibet4. The drop of ones abode and the drawn mandala5.

The drop of great awakeningThe idea of the sixteen-drops practice is fairly straightforward.2’ Like a powerful camera lens zooming from the widest possible angle to a pro­gressively smaller focus and, finally, to a tiny point, the meditation becomes increasingly focused, moving from the entire cosmos to this world in par­ticular, to the realm ofTibet, to the practitioners own dwelling, and finally culminating within your own body. Within your body, you then visualize inside your heart the Perfection of Wisdom Mother, within whose heart is her son, Buddha Sâkyamuni. Within the Buddhas heart is Great Com­passion Avalokites'vara, within whose heart isTärä, and so on, continuing with wrathful Tärä, Acala, Atisa, and Dromtönpa. Within Dromtönpas heart you then visualize Maitreya surrounded by the masters of the line­age of vast practice. In his heart you visualize Nägärjuna surrounded by the masters of the lineage of profound view; and within his heart you visu­alize Vajradhara surrounded by the masters of the lineage of inspirational practice.Finally, inside Vajradhara’s heart, you visualize yourself as a buddha, embodying all three buddha bodies, and within your heart is a white drop the size of a mustard seed. This seed increases in size and turns into a vast radiant jewel container at the center of which your mind is imagined as a yellow drop the size of a pea. This, in turn, increases in size and turns into an ocean of drops the color of refined gold; the ocean is transparent, smooth, resolute, vast, and pervasive, and it reflects all forms. You then rest your mind, without wavering, upon this drop of great awakening, fused, and free of any sense of subject-object duality.In chapter 3, we find the teachings of the three scriptural baskets— the other half of the sevenfold divinity and teaching. Emphasizing the three baskets as the key to understanding the Buddhas teachings, Atis'a shows how the three baskets encompass all the teachings of the Buddha, includ­ing secret mantra. He is also reported as stating that the teaching of the three baskets is highly profitable and has minimal risks. After this advice, the text puts this endorsement in the mouth of the four divinities:"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 15Most excellent one, you who care for the common purpose,Discipline teachings produce the highest divinity of the ethically disciplined;Sutra teachings produce the highest divinity of the noble ones;Knowledge teachings produce the highest divinity of the conquerors.This is so from the perspective of their principal [functions].In reality, all three teachings produce supreme conquerors.These baskets of knowledge teachings lack nothing.Through excellent instructions revealing the path of the three trainingsEmerge innumerable trainees with pure mental streams.Your choice of profound sacred words is unmistaken, O master.They are secure throughout all three times—beginning, middle, and end.May all be blessed to possess these three teachings.”The book then goes on, in chapter 4, to explain how joyful perseverance is crucial for success in practicing the three baskets. Chapter 5 presents a series of disciplines whereby the practitioner learns to guard his or her senses against distraction and unwholesome objects, thereby maintaining meditative focus on the themes of the three baskets within the framework of the three levels of practitioners. In his summation of the chapter, Drom calls the approach the “method of contemplating the divinity and the teaching.”31Chapters 6 to a present various elements of the practice, such as: rec­ognizing that self-cherishing is to blame for all our problems and cultivat­ing the altruistic outlook that perceives others as a source of kindness (chapter 6), the ethical practice of refraining from the ten unwholesome actions (chapter 7), the futility of pursuing material wealth and the need to cultivate the riches of the noble ones (chapter 8), the importance of find­ing a place of solitude (chapter 9), the importance of cultivating and main­taining deep respect for one’s teachers and preceptors (chapter 10), and the way to uphold the sublime beings and their enlightened conduct (chapter n). This chapter also details how to avoid negative friends, how to rely on one’s spiritual mentors, and how to recognize and avoid objects that give rise to aversion and unhappy states of mind."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"In some ways, chapter 12 is the heart of the Father Teachings volume, or a text within a text. Unlike other chapters, it begins with salutation verses where homage is paid to the teachers, the Buddha, the Perfection of Wisdom Mother, and all the protectors. It is by far the longest chapter, with two subsections: part 1, with seven collections (tshoms), and part 2, with nine collections. Entitled “How to Hoist Your Robes to Cross the Mires of Desire,” the chapter opens with an idealized description of a celestial realm that is inside a thousand-petalled lotus and adorned with heavenly lakes. At the hub of this lotus is a five-leveled crystal stupa. This celestial man­sion in the shape of a reliquary stupa is occupied by sublime beings endowed with the highest enlightened qualities. Directed to them in the subsequent sections (collections 2 to 4), the text presents the practice of the seven limbs— prostrating, making offerings, confessing, rejoicing, suppli­cating to turn the wheel of Dharma, appealing not to enter into nirvana, and dedicating. In the fifth collection, the chapter presents a beautiful exposition of the teaching on the twelve links of dependent origination with a lengthy analysis of the nature, characteristics, and functions of the three mental poisons. This is followed, in collection 6, by a presentation on the flaws of attachment and the meditation on impermanence as its principal antidote. Collection 7 outlines the five psychophysical aggregates as well as the sequence of the arising of the twelve links.In part 2 of chapter 12, composed of nine collections, the central theme is contemplation of emptiness and the illusion-like nature of all things. Beginning with general advice, the text proceeds with numerous reflections on the illusory nature of things with a specific contemplation on the appar­ent reality and its union with emptiness. There is a memorable section on the process of death and dying (collection 7), followed by a presentation of transference of consciousness at the time of death. This latter collection contains some fascinating comments on the nature of awareness and con­sciousness at the point of death.After the marathon-like chapter 12, the book slows down and even loses some poignancy in its use of language. The material in subsequent chap­ters may well be a later addition, or simply ancillary pieces deemed impor­tant to include. Chapter 13 deals with Dromtönpa seeking a heritage, a legacy of a pure way of life, while chapter 14 addresses how you overcome any self-importance that may result from embracing a pure way of life. This is followed in chapter 15 with tools for dealing with adverse situations, such as being criticized.

Chapter 17 underscores the importance of being steadfast in the sevenfold divinity and teaching and the need to counter laziness and discouragement by reaffirming your motivation. Chapter 18 discusses how you engage with others, especially through your speech, to help nurture their minds. In these discussions, the text cites various Buddhist masters, including Atis'a’s own teachers Serlingpa, Avadhütipa, Dharmaraksita, Sintipa, and Jetâri. Chapter 19 takes the theme of the preceding chapter further and emphasizes the need to constantly pursue others’ welfare. Chapter 20 deals with nonsectarianism, and Atis'a emphasizes the impor­tance of being committed to one’s own path without denigrating the spir­itual orientations and paths of others. This is then followed, in chapter 21, with the dedication of positive karma and purification of negative karma. Chapter 22 is a wonderful exposition of the so-called seven riches of the noble ones— faith, morality, giving, learning, conscience, a sense of shame, and insight. In the final chapter, chapter 23, the entire teachings of volume I of the book are condensed into two simple practices referred to as the two examinations. They are: examining or guarding your speech when among many, and examining and guarding your mind when alone, as encapsulated in the following two lines in Atis'a’s Bodhisattva's Jew el Garland:Among others guard your speech;When alone guard your mind.34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"i8 The Book of KadamTh e So n Te a c h in g sAs noted above, the second volume of The Book o f Kadam contains the Son Teachings, which is foremost a collection of birth stories of Dromtönpa’s former lives as narrated, according to the book, by Master Atis'a. Each of these birth stories is related in some way to the accounts of Dromtönpa having engaged in a former life in practices described in the root text. Some of these stories make an explicit link between the principal figure of the main story with Dromtönpa and the country of Tibet. For example, we find Prince Asañga, a previous life of Dromtömpa, speaking the following prophetic lines in chapter 2 of the Son Teachings:0 my two parents,In the future, in the last five-hundred-year cycle,On the crest of snow mountains,My father, Prabhäs'rl, so-named By the dâkinïs of Udhyäna,Will be Drom’s father, Yaksher Kushen.My mother, the devout Sati,Will be known as Khuö Salenchikma.1 will be born on that crest of snow mountains.35Similarly, in the same chapter, we find the following prophesy being made by a noble one:I will be known as Dipamkara,Dispelling the darkness of that land.You will be a treasury of Buddhas teaching Known as Gyalwai Jungné.I will be the “great Atis'a,”Venerated by the name “the sole god.”You will be Upäsaka Dharmavardana.34 Venerated as the spiritual mentor Tönpa.37From the perspective of the larger Tibetan tradition, especially the myth of Avalokites'varas unique affinity with the Land of Snows, chapters 5 and 19 of the birth stories are the most important. In the former, the longest chapter in the volume by far, we find the following oft-quoted lines:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 19To the north of Bodhgaya, which lies in the east,Is a place called Tibet, the kingdom of Pu,Where there are sky[-touching] pillars of towering mountains,Lakes of turquoise mirrors in the lowlands,Crystal stupas of white snow,Golden mounded hills of yellow grass,Incense offerings of medicinal plants,Golden flowers with vibrant colors,And, in summer, blossoms of turquoise blue.O Avalokitesvara, lord of the snow mountains,There lies your special domain;There you shall find your devotees.38Also, we read:In general, he is lord of all beings;In particular, he will reign in the land of snow mountains.39Chapter 19 of the Son Teachings, the second longest chapter of the vol­ume, is the most elaborate in developing this theme of Tibet as uniquely associated with Avalokitesvara and of Dromtönpas place within this scheme. For example, the text tells the story of how, when Dromtonpa was born as Devaräja, a youth prophesized that when the era of degeneration dawns and the Buddhas teaching declines, Devaräja will, at the urging of the bodhi- sattva SarvanivaranviSkamvin, take the form of a king and establish the foun­dation for Buddhadharma in the barbarian land ofTibet/0 He will take birth as a king renowned as an emanation of Great Compassion Avalokitesvara (namely, Songtsen Gampo) and will invite Tara (the Chinese princess Wen-ch’eng) and BhrkutI (the Nepalese princess) to the central region of Tibet. He will thus transform this barbarian borderland into a central land where the Dharma will flourish. The text then goes on to state that a large gathering of monks, all blessed by Dípamkaras'rijñána, will converge, and at that time people will recite the name of Avalokitesvara and make supplications to him. They will see the emanation body (nirmänakäya) of Avalokitesvara, listen to teachings from him, and be introduced to the tantric practices related to the six-syllable mantra. In brief, great compassion will flourish so widely that the central region ofTibet will resemble the pure land of Pótala/1"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"20 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mAn important element of the story is the presence of Atis'a’s former lives in Buddhisms earlier history in Tibet. At one point in the narrative, Atis'a explicitly identifies himself with Padmasambhava, who, the text states, is well known among the mantrikas.3* Interestingly, the chapter provides a brief chronicle of many of Tibet’s rulers. Three of them—Songtsen Gampo, Trisong Detsen, and Tri Ralpachen— are referred to with the now well- known epithet, the “three founding righteous kings,” and many of the rulers are said to be emanations of lords of the three Buddha families— Avalokitesvara, Mañjus'ri, and Vajrapâni. It seems that there also evolved among the Kadampas a tradition that identifies Dromtönpa’s three princi­pal brother disciples with the lords of the three Buddha families and, more intriguingly, with three famous self-arisen images of Avalokitesvara.'13One of the most interesting aspects of the nineteenth chapter is its close connection with another important Tibetan work of some antiquity that appeared to be a key text in the propagation of the tradition of identifying Tibetan imperial figures with Avalokitesvara. This is the famous Kakholma Testament (literally, Testament Extractedfrom a Pillar), purportedly authored by the seventh-century Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo and later redis­covered as a revealed treasure text. According to a tradition dating back to the twelfth century, Atis'a is credited with having retrieved this text in Lhasa toward the end of the 1040s.34 In fact, in the present redaction of the tes­tament, the text opens with an interesting discussion of Atis'a’s visit to the Lhasa cathedral and some miraculous visions he experienced relating to the image of the self-originated Avalokitesvara icon there. In the text’s colophon, Atisa is quoted as saying that he saw the manuscript of the tes­tament written on a blue silk cloth with gold letters and that there were three versions of the text. He also explicitly states that the text was discov­ered as a treasure in the cathedral of Lhasa.35The Structure o f the Book ofK adamThe two volumes of The Book o f Kadam contain more than just the Father and Son Teachings. Fifty-four texts altogether were compiled by Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsen (1225-1305), the ninth abbot of Narthang, to create the final version of the book.Four texts in The Book o f Kadam are preliminary: Dromtönpa’s The Book’s Sealed Command, his Self-Exhortation (entry I of the present vol­ume), and Khenchen’s The Liberating Life Stories o f the Lineage Teachers o f"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n z ithe Sevenfold D ivinity and Teaching and Elucidation o f the Heart-Drop Prac­tice (entry IV).

The core of the Father Teachings, The Jew el G arland o f Dialogues, appears in twenty-three chap­ters (entry III) and is supplemented with three additional chapters found in the second volume at the end of Dromtönpa’s birth stories. Thus, the Father Teachings are actually comprised of twenty-six chapters. Volume 2 has twenty-two chapters of birth stories (excerpted in entries V-VIII), all of which are part of the main book, and a supplementary chapter that is also considered part of the main book. Therefore, forty-nine texts in total form the main book.45In addition to the main book, redactions of The Book ofKadam contain five ancillary texts. The short text Perfect Array o f the Forms ofM aster Atisa and His Son, authored by Khenchen, was written entirely in verse and appears to be a poetic summary of the entire book. Volume 1 also contains four important biographical works: How Atisa Relinquished H is Kingdom and Sought Liberation, attributed to Dromtönpa; The Story ofAtisas Voyage to Sumatra, attributed to Atis'a himself;47 Chim Namkha Drak’s Biography o f M aster Atisa; and Biography and Itinerary o f Master Atisa, also attributed to Dromtönpa.48The present volume contains the main twenty-three chapters of the Father Teachings, four chapters from the Son Teachings, and some of the ancillary teachings. I have also included here three additional texts, two more recent compositions in verse summarizing the key points of The Book ofK adam to help the reader better understand how the book was viewed and practiced historically, and one of the earliest anthologies of the sayings of the Kadam masters. This last text, compiled by Chegom Sherap Dorjé in the twelfth century, provides the reader with a unique perspective on how richly developed the oral tradition became for the followers of Master Atis'a and Dromtönpa.The Origins o f the “Precious Book\"We now come to the difficult question of the dating of The Book ofKadam . There is no doubt the final version of the book was compiled by Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsen. In fact, we have a clear statement by Khenchen that it was on the thirtieth day of the month of Gyal in the Water Tiger year"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"22 T h e B o o k o fK a d a m(1302) chat he completed his work.45 This could mean that the woodblock printing was completed, or it could mean that the final scribing of the manuscript for the blockprint was done on that day. In any case, it was either at the turn of the fourteenth century or toward the final years of the thirteenth century that the present version of the two-volume book was compiled.But how far back can we trace the origins of the book? In addressing this question, we must first distinguish between two notions of the book— the final version of the book that we have today and an archaic version.50 It is the archaic version— its date of origin and the personalities involved in its creation— that remains unclear. To understand these we need to look also at the early transmission of the teachings of the book, at least as it is under­stood by the tradition. Chapter 23 of the Father Teachings concludes with a short colophon that gives an account of the earliest origin of the teach­ings of the so-called precious book. According to this account, it was Ngok Lekpai Sherap who, at the urging of Mañjus'rí, went to Mount Lhari Nyingpo in Yerpa, where Master Atis'a and Dromtönpa were residing, and requested them to enter into a series of dialogues based upon Bodhisattva’s Jew el Garland. This discussion takes place over three years, and it is said that Ngok then set these dialogues down in the form of a book.51 Ngok passed the transmission of the book to Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen (c. eleventh century), who in turn transmitted it to Phuchungwa. From Phuchungwa the transmission passed through Kama Rinchen Gyaltsen, to Shangtön Dharma Gyaltsen, and to Tapka Jangchup Sangpo. Thus, from Drom to Jangchup Sangpo, the book was transmitted through a direct one-to-one lineage of teachers— teachers who Tapka Namkha Rinchen (ca. 1214-86) called the “seven precious beings.”52Until Namkha Rinchen, it is maintained, the transmission of the teach­ing of the book was passed down in one-to-one instruction. However, Namkha Rinchen, following his move to Tapka Monastery after the death of Jangchup Sangpo, spent the rest of his life preaching the \"profound meanings of the precious book” to worthy disciples. Namkha Rinchen’s public preaching also signals a shift from a so-called “miracle book,” which he is said to have hidden in the great reliquary stupa at Tapka Monastery, to a physical scripture.53After Namkha Rinchen comes Drom Kumäramati, who was born in the Iron-Sheep year, most probably 1211 (if not 1271). He met with Namkha Rinchen at a young age, and by fifteen he had already committed the entire"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 13Book ofKadam to memory. Namkha Rinchen was so impressed by this feat that he is said to have remarked, “Now you have exceeded me. Even I do not have the book in my memory in its entirety. Among the previous mas­ters, too, it seems that there were very few who had committed the entire book to memory. Since you have the residue of past good karma, you have the entire book in your memory.”54 Namkha Rinchen then handed over the custody of some religious items of great significance with the transmission of the book. These include, among other objects, a painting of Mañjus'n drawn by Ngok based on the vision he experienced when he was urged to go to Yerpa to receive the teachings of the book, a small painting of Atisa and Dromtönpa with Ngok and Khutön done by Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen, and several religious articles that Phuchungwa possessed, such as a lock of Dromtönpa’s hair, some relics, and a small hand drum that belonged to Atis'a.55 It was from Drom Kumaramati that Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsen, the editor of the final version of the book, received the transmission, including the initiation into the mandata of the sixteen drops. One could say that what Khenchen did was to set down in writing what his own teacher, Drom Kumaramati, had stored in his memory from a young age. In fact, the later tradition sees Drom Kumaramati as a reincarnation of Dromtönpa himself and as responsible for the “reappearance” of the pre­cious book as a physical text that subsequent practitioners can benefit from.So how far back can we trace the archaic version? A number of facts strongly suggest the existence of such a book long before Khenchens time. In this early, “primitive” form, it seems to be referred to as “the book” (glegs bam), “the precious book” (glegs bam rin po che), or sometimes as The Jew el G arland o f Dialogues. Let us look at some of the evidence for its earlier provenance.The first piece of evidence is The Book’s Sealed Command, the opening text in The Book o f Kadam attributed to Dromtönpa. Although some would argue that no such book existed at Dromtönpas time, I see no rea­son to reject the attribution of this short verse text to Drom. In it, we find an explicit reference to the teaching of the higher qualities of Dromtönpa, most certainly an allusion to his birth stories. Furthermore, we also find mention of The Jew el Garland o f Dialogues with, the statement that it stems from the conqueror (the Buddha), flows to the conqueror himself (Atis'a), and is endowed with the practice of the four immeasurable thoughts. There is also an explicit emphasis on the point that Atis'a’s teachings embody all three lineages of vast practice, profound view, and inspirational practice.56"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"24 The Book ofKadamAt the end of this short work, Khenchen adds: “This [work] resides at the beginning of volume i in the format of a smaller text. Stating that one should read this Sealed Command prior to giving this teaching, [the teach­ers] read this text once. In particular, the first six stanzas of this work can occasionally be found inscribed at the end of many of the longer chapters.”57 Since the birth stories of Dromtönpa’s former lives are at the heart of the teachings of the book, it makes sense on the part of Drom to insist on a restricted transmission of these teachings, indicating a certain reluctance for this teaching to become widespread— hence, the book’s sealed command.Second, Liberating L ife Stories o f the Lineage Teachers o f the Sevenfold D ivinity and Teaching, a history of the book’s origins as compiled and edited by Khenchen, contains several exchanges between Dromtönpa and Ngok about putting the contents of the book into written form. Drom dis­courages Ngok by admonishing him to focus on his meditative practice rather than worrying about writing the book down. However, Ngok pledges to write it down to ensure that fixture generations will have access to it.5* Since the book “scribed” by Ngok cannot be conventionally seen in public, it acquires the epithet “miracle book.” Furthermore, Ngok is reported as saying to his disciple Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen, “Sherap Gyaltsen, you have come. As for this teaching of ours, I have undone the sealed com­mand of my teacher and have committed it to letter.”5'7 There are many statements like this that relate to a “secret” teaching inherited by Ngok and passed on to Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen. The richness of these sayings are such that they strongly indicate the existence of an oral tradition, going back at least to Ngok and Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen, related to a secret teaching of Atis'a and Dromtönpa.Third, the sources that Khenchen relied upon in his compilation of L ib ­erating Life Stories act as further evidence for the prior existence of an ear­lier archaic version of the book. On several occasions, Khenchen explicitly names the sources for the various sections of his Liberating Life Stories and clearly indicates that he is, at best, the compiler of this historical work rather than its author in the strict sense. For instance, Khenchen attributes a fairly lengthy account of how Phuchungwa received the transmission and passed it on to Rinchen Gyaltsen himself. In addition, the entire text of Khenchen’s history is based on a twenty-five-stanza salutation to the mas­ters of the lineage of the book authored by the earlier thirteenth-century figure, Namkha Rinchen.60 This verse explicitly mentions the rwenty-two birth stories of Dromtönpa as well as the statement that all the teachings"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 25can be subsumed under the practice of “hoisting your robes to cross the mire of desire,” which, in turn, can be subsumed into the seven riches of the noble ones, and which, finally, can be subsumed into the practice of the heart drop.61 This, in essence, is the heart of the teaching of the Father Teachings volume. For these reasons, I am inclined to conclude that the book, at least the core of the Father Teachings and the Son Teachings, existed long before Khenchen’s time.Perhaps the most important piece of evidence to consider is the existence of a text, attributed to Phuchungwa, that indicates an archaic version of the book’s Father Teachings existed as early as the eleventh century. This text is cited in full by Yongzin Yeshé Gyaltsen in his Rite o f the M andala o f the Sixteen Drops o f Kadam.w The work begins with Dromtönpa request­ing Master Atiáa to reveal a teaching that would integrate all the sacred words of the Buddha into personal instructions; a teaching that is free of the dangerous abyss, uncluttered, free of error, uncontaminated, and sup­ported by authoritative sources; a teaching that is to the point, is easy to implement in practice, possesses a firm foundation, shows the stages of the path as well-ordered, and, finally, presents a path that cannot lead to false­hood.63 The text then goes on to describe how Atiáa responds to this request by presenting the method of integrating all the teachings of the Buddha within the framework of the three scriptural baskets. Even the profound teachings of tantra, such as the dohä cycles of Saraha, are shown to be encompassed by the teachings of the three baskets. Needless to say, the three baskets also include die meditation on emptiness as the ulimate nature of all things. This is followed by a lengthy discussion of the choice of four principal divinities for Kadam practitioners, with a special empha­sis on how all the meditative practices of the profound tan trie teachings are subsumed under the generation and completion stages of Avalokites'vara practice. In this manner the master Atis'a presents the profound practice of the sevenfold divinity and teaching to Dromtönpa in the course of a series of dialogues at the retreat of Yerpa. Interestingly, in Phuchungwa’s “abridged” version, Atisa constantly refers to Dromtönpa with the expres­sion “dear son” (nye ba’i sras) as opposed to “principal son” (sras kyi thu bo), as found in the final version. Phunchungwa’s text ends with the following colophon: “This completes the secret teaching of Dharma king Drom, the sacred words and instruction on the sevenfold divinity and teaching, which was given as a teaching.”64 After this short colophon we find a brief account of the story of the teaching:"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"2.6 The Book of KadamThe story of its origin is this. The Dharma king renowned as Lord Atiáa came from India to this mandala of Great Compas­sion [i.e., Tibet], though he had countless disciples...Among the coundess joyful feasts of teachings he gave, this instruction on the sevenfold divinity and teaching was set down in writing by the emanation body Ngok Lekpai Sherap, a bodhisattva blessed by Mañjuári. Following this, I, the Buddhist monk Phuchungwa Shönu Gyaltsen, one who has been blessed by the conqueror and his son [i.e., Atiáa and Drom] and whose heart has been permeated by their enlightened activities, penned this on the basis of making supplications to my teacher. The spiri­tual mentors sealed command is on this, but fearing that this teaching might disappear, I could not bear living alone in the wilderness without putting it in writing.Whatever shortcomings may be in this,I request the forbearance of the assembly of noble ones;Whatever virtues are in thisI dedicate toward great awakening for the welfare of beings.Thus, throughout all my lives,May I obtain human existence and be ethically pure;Remaining at the feet of my teachers,May I spend my time in learning, reflection, and meditation,And may all my teachers’ aspirations be fulfilled.65Based on the sources available, I am inclined to believe that the present version of the book, especially with its division into Father and Son Teach­ings (here I am speaking of the core texts— the twenty-three main chapters and three supplementary chapters of the Father Teachings and the twenty- two birth stories of Dromtönpa), is principally the product of three indi­viduals—Namkha Rinchen, Drom Kumaramati, and Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsen, all of whom belong to the thirteenth century. Drops in the form of light circles in the visualization of specific meditation deities is found much earlier in the lineage, but the systematic practice of Kadam’s four meditation deities in the form of sixteen drops based on the construction of a mandala appears likely to have been developed by the above three mas­ters. This said, the idea that there are forty-eight sections or “chapters” to"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 27the book may preceed even Namkha Ránchen. For example, the encounter between Phuchungwa and Sherap Gyaltsen includes a mention of forty- eight days during which Phuchungwa came to understand each chapter in relation to a drop and how he realized the nature of each to be that of a sphere. It is also stated that Phuchungwa was spiritually nurtured by Sherap Gyaltsen for a period of 290 days, during which he transmitted the entire sixteen drops and abided in the sixteen drops of meditation deities and in the sixteenth awakening drop.“Initially this set of teachings appeared to have been known simply as the oral instruction on the sevenfold divinity and teaching? an expression that may even be traceable to Dromtönpa himself. As we noted earlier, Phuchungwa’s text not only presents the core teachings of the book but also retains the overall structure of the book— beginning with salutations to the teachers of the three lineages through to the meditation on the four divini­ties, the presentation of how three scriptural baskets are the framework for the entire Buddhist teachings, how their practice is encapsulated in the three higher trainings, and how the distilled essence of these three is the practices of the persons of the three capacities. Furthermore, the schema of the five recollections as the main medium of meditative practice is pre­sented, as well the intriguing notion of hoisting of ones robes to cross the mire of desire. Interestingly, Phuchungwas text nowhere mentions the expression “the book” (glegs bam) but ends with the concluding statement “This concludes the sevenfold divinity and teaching, the secret teaching of the Dharma king Drom, which has been given as a practice.”68 At some point, Drom’s birth stories appeared to have become an additional part of the core teachings of this sevenfold divinity and teaching.That Atis'a is the author of Bodhisattva’s Jew el G arland which became the root text of both the Father and Son Teachings, remains beyond doubt, given its similarités in content, language, and structure to Atis'a’s other recorded works. But there is no obvious connection, apart from the rela­tionship of a root text to its commentary, between the instructions on the sevenfold divinity and teaching, centered especially on the meditative prac­tice of Avalokitesvara, and Atisa’s short text, which on the surface pertains to standard bodhisattva practices. Who then is responsible for relating the two strands of teachings in this unique manner? Apart from the individual texts featured in the book, we have no sources available to help us resolve this question. Perhaps there is something to the fifteenth-century Kagyii historian Tsuklak Trengwa’s remark that Bodhisattva’s Jew el Garland was"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mcompiled by Dromtönpa on the basis of Atis'a’s oral instructions.65 If this is true, it is conceivable that an oral tradition connected with Dromtönpa and based on the instructions pertaining to this short work may have evolved fairly early. Given the specific nature of the oral tradition pertain­ing to the early, “legendary” transmission of the teachings of the book, I am also inclined to accept that the two figures—Ngok Lekpai Sherap and Sherap Gyaltsen, both of whom met Atis'a and Drom—were responsible for the initial development of, or at least the idea of, a special corpus of Kadam teachings centered on Drom as the spiritual heir of Master Atis'a and, more importantly, as an incarnation of Avalokites'vara. Based on the textual evidence, I would argue that Phuchungwa was perhaps the first to write down this special corpus of teachings. In any case, by Phuchungwa’s time, especially after the death of Dromtönpa, the idea that Dromtönpa was an emanation of Avalokites'vara appears to have already taken firm root in Tibet, at least in the region where Atis'a and Drom’s followers were most active.The D alai Lamas and the Later Transmissions o f the BookFollowing the formal compilation of the texts of The Book o f Kadam by Khenchen around 1302, the transmission of the teachings of this special collection becomes easier to discern. In his records of teachings received, the eighteenth-century Geluk author Longdöl Ngawang Lobsang provides the following transmission lineage: from Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsen to Rinchen Jangchup, then through Jangchup Pal, Rikkyi Dakpoi Pal, Sönam Oser, Sangyé Sangpo, Sönam Sangpo, Paljor Sangpo, Sengé Gyaltsen, who passed it on to the translator Thukjé Palwa, who transmitted the teachings to Gendlin Drup (1391-1474), later recognized as the First Dalai Lama. The First Dalai Lama gave the transmission to Panchen Yeshé Tsemo, who passed it on to Gendiin Gyatso (1476-1542), later recognized as the Second Dalai Lama.70 (The present volume features a short verse text by Gendiin Gyatso [entry IX] that beautifully summarizes The Book o f Kadam ) According to later historical sources, it is through the efforts of the First and Second Dalai Lamas that the transmission of the book became wide­spread in central and southern Tibet.71 The Fifth Dalai Lama’s (1617-82) R iver Ganges Flow : A Record o f Teachings Received provides a similar lin­eage of transmission from Khenchen up to Sönam Sangpo, at which point the Great Fifth gives two streams of transmission, neither of which"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"In tr o d u c t io n 29contains the First and the Second Dalai Lamas, suggesting several diver­gent lineages of the book from the fifteenth century onward.72The noted Geluk author Panchen Sönam Drakpa (1478-1554), who was a student of the Second Dalai Lama and a tutor of the Third, states that from Gendlin Drup, Mönlam Palwa received the transmission and taught this both at Ganden and Drepung, two of the largest Geluk monasteries in central Tibet.73 Gendlin Gyatso, after receiving the transmission from Panchen YeshéTsemo, caused a great rain of the precious book to fall upon many people in the U and Tsang provinces in central Tibet, as well as in Nyal, Dakpo, Kongpo, and many other regions far from central Tibet. Furthermore, according to the same source, the bodhisattva Lodrö Gyal- tsen (1402-72) received the transmission in Tsang and spread it to western Tibet. The elders Jangyalwa and Sötrepa received this transmission, the lat­ter bringing the teaching to Yarlung.74 That a transmission lineage of the book is listed by Pema Karpo (1527-96), a principal master of the Drukpa Kagyii lineage, as well as by Taklung Ngawang Namgyal (1571-1626), one of the luminaries of the Taklung Kagyii lineage, indicates that transmis­sion of the book took place within non-Kadam and non-Geluk traditions as well.Despite its widespread acceptance from its first appearance as a physical text, it seems that even as late as the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, qualms were being raised about its authenticity. We find, for example, a memorable remark attributed to the Second Dalai Lama, who, in response to the question about The Book o f Kadam s authenticity, is said to have replied, “As to how authentic [the ascription of the book to Atisa is], I do not know. I certainly find it most beneficial to my mind.”75 Similarly, we read the following comment by Tsuklak Trengwa: “These days some who consider it adequate to know only how to discard the Dharma denigrate the book. This is Maras doing.”76 For Tsuklak Trengwa, The Book ofKadam is unique for its presentation of the sixteen drops, the sevenfold divinity and teaching, and the five recollections— in brief, for its presentation of the essence of all the teachings of the Buddha by condensing them into a sin­gle practice for guarding one’s mind.77Although the first Dalai Lamas and their immediate disciples appear to have been the primary force behind the early dissemination of the book in the Geluk school, later, with Panchen Lobsang Chögyen (1570-1662), some masters of the so-called ear-whispered teachings (snyan brgyud) also took deep interest in the book’s transmission, especially the initiations into"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mthe sixteen drops. Among these masters was Yongzin Yeshé Gyaltsen (1713-93), who composed substantial works pertaining to the book and the meditative practice of the sixteen drops. One of these works, a lucid text in verse presenting the essential teachings of The Book o f Kadam within the framework of Atis'a’s schema for the practices of the persons of three capac­ities— i.e., the stages of the path approach— is featured in the present vol­ume (entry X).Although it was only later that a systematic narrative evolved whereby the successive Dalai Lamas were cast as emanations of Avalokitesvara—a lineage that links the Dalai Lamas with both Dromtönpa and Songtsen Gampo— the identification of Gendlin Drup with Dromtönpa was already well established. For example, Gendiin Drup’s biographer, Yeshé Tsemo, cites the translator Thukjé Palwa as stating, after transmitting the book to Gendiin Drup, “Therefore, I am a man of meritorious collection, for I have heard [the book] from Drom and have now passed it on to Drom.”78 Sim­ilarly, the fifteenth-century historian of the Kadam School, Lechen Kiinga Gyaltsen, himself a student of the Gendiin Drup, states that although some say Gendiin Drup is a manifestation, of Nägärjuna and others say he is a reincarnation of the Kadam master Neusurpa, he is known by most as the emanation of Dromtönpa.7’ By the end of the sixteenth century, authors of other schools also came to refer to the First Dalai Lama as a reincarna­tion of Dromtönpa.80 Furthermore, according to some sources, his family hailed from the same ancestral lineage as Dromtönpa’s. When Gendiin Gyatso was formally recognized as the reincarnation of Gendiin Drup, the connection was naturally formed between the Second Dalai Lama and Dromtönpa, and through this relationship to Avalokitesvara himself.It was the Great Fifth, however, who created the edifice of the mytho- religious worldview in which the institution of the Dalai Lamas came to have a significance far greater than that of the successive reincarnations of an important historical spiritual figure, namely Gendiin Drup. The Great Fifth and his ingenious regent, Desi Sangyé Gyatso (1653-1705), brought about a creative marriage of the two textual sources for the narrative of Avalokites'vara’s direct intervention in the unfolding fate of the Tibetan land and its people.81 Both the Kakholma Testament and Dromtönpa’s birth stories in The Book o f Kadam were already recognized as possessing some mysterious background, one a revealed treasure text and the other literally a “miraculous volume.” In his influential History o f Ganden Tradition, Desi Sangyé Gyatso, in addition to providing copious citations from scripture,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"In t r o d u c t io n 31interweaves beautifully evocative quotes from The Book o f Kadam and Kakholma Testament to explicidy identify the Great Fifth with Songtsen Gampo, Dromtönpa, the treasure revealer Nyangral Nyima öser (1124-92), Ngari Panchen (1487-1542), and especially the preceding Dalai Lamas— Gendiin Drup, Gendlin Gyatso, and Sönam Gyatso.®* Through efforts like this, the Great Fifth and his regent integrated the myth of Ava- lokites'vara’s compassionate manifestation as rulers and spiritual teachers in the Land of Snows throughout the ages into a concrete institution that the Tibetans could nurture, preserve, and cherish.

Amid this vast array of perfect emanation beings was the one hailed as Dromtön Gyalwai Jungné.Drom had performed numerous enlightened activities consistent with the needs of others. In general, [these activities] conformed to the mental states of dependently arisen sentient beings, equal to the expanse of space, who were beyond comparison and measurement, and who possessed their own diverse modes of behavior [26] and diverse aspirations in conjunction with such behavior. In brief, [his activities conformed to the mental states of] the incalculable beings who are subsumed within die six classes, all of whom participate in the causes and effects of karma and the afflictions. He did so by assuming life forms suited to [their needs], adopting suitable lan­guages, and donning appropriate ornaments and attire. He gave teachings appropriate to their contexts; he sought material goods beneficial to them; he promoted the paths suited to their fortunate karma and raised them to ever higher elevations.Here in the Land of the Snows as well, he assumed successive lives as kings, ministers, and bodhisattvas, thereby leading all [beings] to an abun­dance of teachings and material wealth. With the knowledge that they are receptive vessels for the ambrosia of the uncontaminated teachings, he led [them] to it. [Looking] into the future, [he had seen that] the people of the Land of Snows will be greedy and expect immediate results. Failing to sub­mit to one another, they will be of a brute nature. Some, in their love of the powerful, will set themselves apart at the top; while some, because of their excessive laziness and procrastination, will segregate themselves at the bottom. Most of the spiritual practitioners will fail to adopt restraint toward the causes and effects of subtle nonvirtuous karma, and proclaim­ing, “We are pure because karma does not exist,” they will defy the subtle norms of karma. Some will defy them knowingly, while some will fail to practice them due to ignorance. Some, while carrying a few words of the Mahayana [scriptures] in their mouths, will denigrate the practice of the profound virtuous deeds at all three stages— at the start, in the middle, and at the end. Some will have the desire to practice Dharma, but remain doomed because they will not know how.

Some will fail to find masters who can teach on the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s 67basis of combining exposition with [actual] practice. Seeing these numer­ous instances of decline with respect to comprehensive Dharma practice, [Dromtönpa] took birth in the nomad lands of the north.The reasons for his assuming the form of a master from the nomads are: (1) his compassion for the unlearned nomads who take life for the sake of food; (2) his compassion for those numerous householders who could not undertake Dharma practice on the basis of the monastic way of life; (3) his wish to help prevent the disparagement of the spiritual practices of non­monastics, which he feared might arise following his [death] as a result of excessive attachment to monastic life; and, (4) moreover, the need to help vanquish, through compassionate means, the many hostile forces— both humans and nonhumans—who injure the Buddhas teaching; [27] (5) fur­thermore, the need to help draw others to the daylong precepts and the vows of lay persons by indicating that even someone like Dromtönpa was an upäsaka [lay vow holder] and that these lay precepts are easier to observe and are also a source of great benefit, and then gradually to lead them [on the path]; (6) the need to help expand and perfect the relics and represen­tations of the Three Jewels, even if this were to lead him to take birth in the hells; and (7) on the basis of this, to help ensure the happiness and joy of all beings while developing their faith and respect. Even though he him­self had already eradicated all the factors to be relinquished, he assumed the form of a lay upäsaka, thus keeping a low profile.He had modest desires and was easily contented; he was thoroughly peaceful and disciplined, and possessed a sense of shame and conscience. Skilled in the methods, he had entered the door of Dharma. He was, there­fore, outside the ranks of all ordinary householders. In fact, he was taken by them as an object for accumulating merit and as an object of venera­tion. Because it was easy for them to honor him, he was invited to even the smallest of [feast] offerings. Thus he led [many householders] to the ranks of the fortunate ones [possessing] the daylong precepts and the vows of an upäsaka. Even if there were twenty sponsors at one given time, he did not remain confined to one alone, but would present himself to all of them, even though this was not evident to the others. In this way, he would inter­act with benefactors equal to the farthest reaches of the sky.Again, because he did not adopt the saffron robes [of a monk], he would proclaim that he was an upäsaka and would honor with his crown those endowed with ethical discipline. He would honor them by placing on his crown even a patch of cloth from their robes. Even when there was a very"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68 T h e B o o k o fK a d a myoung novice monk, he would say “O you monastics, please come first” and would assert that he himself was outside the ranks of the monastic community. Nevertheless, because he himself implemented all [the aspects of] the law of karma and its effects, there was no one whom he advised that would not listen [to his words] and say, “This is true indeed.” Furthermore, even if one were to put the entire wealth ofTibet together in one place, this would not rival the wealth given in a day by the great upäsaka to the poor and destitute in China, Nepal, Kashmir, and Tibet. This [fact] is not known by those are fettered [in bondage].Although in general he performed numerous acts, such as leading [sen­tient beings] to the six perfections and giving helpful affirmations with regard to their conduct, in particular, he led them to the precious ethical discipline— the basis of numerous higher qualities— and gave high praises [when others gave] verbal affirmations for such wholesome conduct. [28] As for [the story of] how many emanations appeared from him and how they fulfilled the well-being of sentient beings, these will be known later [in the text].125 In addition, there were diverse enlightened intentions related to his ocean-like wisdom mind that are not presented here, for they are beyond the scope of explanation.So when the great refuge [Atis'a] was residing amid such an unimaginably perfect setting as described above, the following occurred to [Dromtönpa]:“At this moment, when the omniscient one is alive, I can cut the [rope of my] doubts pertaining to good and evil. Due to the force of [the nega­tive karma of] his potential spiritual trainees, the conqueror could depart to other realms. Should this happen, it will be difficult for me to request [the teachings]. These days, because of the degenerate nature of the era and because sentient beings have untamed temperaments, even if one reveals to them the profound instructions, they do not practice. They may [in fact] accumulate nonvirtuous karma in relation to the spiritual teachers. So at this time, I would like to request a teaching that most paragons of virtue who will appear after me can rely upon. Today in particular, many celestial youths in the clouds are adorned with various ornaments and carry unimaginable quantities of offerings. Some hoist parasols and victory ban­ners, some raise inconceivable precious banners, and some carry various articles, such as celestial incense, lamps, and so on. Some hold unimagin­able collections of musical instruments, like flutes, violins, and so on, [resounding] with melodious tunes.

I request the sublime teachers to proclaim these most blessed names,” [Dromtönpa] proclaimed:“O Dipamkara, most excellent of gods,Unrivalled by any other,You are the refuge of all beings.Compelled by wisdom, pray listen to me.“Today when you, the conqueror, are alive, [29]You, the Dharma key of benefit and joy,Reside here because of the fortunate ones.If I fail to cut [the rope of] my doubts,Due to [the negative karma of] the trainees, O Dharma lord,You might depart to other realms.It would then be difficult, in this degenerate era, to approach you.At this time when untamed beings whose natures remain wild Do not put into practice the teachings revealed to them And deceive the teachers in return for kindness,I seek from you a teaching that can withstand our trust.“Ema!

Failing to reach their own secure base they follow after others’ fame and renown. It is indeed a source of great amazement that, despite having heard many profound teachings, they chase after their desire [for more]. They compete to find out which they can do faster— receive [a teaching] or discard it.“However, if I put this [teaching] into practice and later take a few suit­able vessels, such as the three brothers, to an uninhabited region and engage in meditative practice, [wellsprings of] experience will bubble forth, and clear light awareness will be set ablaze. [48] Though the face of the entire earth may become filled with the dances [of heroes and hero­ines], what good would this do? It is vital to think of the Buddhas teach­ing as a whole. For example, for a king to reign over his kingdom, having his thirst quenched, his hunger satisfied, and his happiness intact may [actually] be helpful. Since I have to serve the kingdom of the buddhas of the three times, this effort to cover and hide the secret mantra, as one might veil a naked womans body, requires serving the Buddhas teaching as a whole.165 So why would I, an old man resembling the setting sun, having become versed in the scriptural baskets, not engage in a practice that is most profitable and victorious— one that can be couched by anyone and observed by anyone? When coming into contact [with the scriptural bas­kets], one’s mouth becomes well fed; when touched, one’s hands become softened. One’s gains are mountain-sized, even though the risks are only the size of a head.166“Later [I might decide], ‘I will make certain to master the dohäs and take some [students] such as the three brothers.’ So when people will hear the announcements that there are some excellent beings in an uninhabited region, they will say, ‘There are some amazing perfected adepts there; we must go receive teachings.’ They might bring some material gifts and come to me. At such time, I could reveal [the dohäs] to them on the basis of examining whether they are pure receptacles. Some [false teachers], think­ing that the presence of one or two favorable conditions is adequate, might feel amazed and exclaim, ‘You have accumulated great merits and have thus come to listen to such [teachings of] the Great Vehicle.’ And without examining what kind of vessels they are, might pour the contents into them indiscriminately. Or, later, some might assert that this is the tradition of the teacher Drom, and they might consume the profound secret mantras permitted food [such as meat and alcohol] while not undertaking the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"104 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mrequisite rites. Calling it by the name ‘ambrosia,’ they might drink alcohol without restraint. Calling it ‘skillful means,’ they might consume meat with no restraint. When actually consuming [the meat], because they have failed to understand death on the basis of other sentient beings, the great tantric adepts, the so-called vajra-holders, would be slaying with their own hands the parents of bodhisattvas and the divinities of tantric practices. At such times, one risks engaging in [deeds similar to] rites of cattle sacrifice!“Next, calling it a ritual feast, heedless, many would congregate and dance without restraint. Many so-called perfected ones would fall down drunk. Then, pretending to be a buddha in the flesh, he would be delu­sional from drinking the ambrosial drink of the buddhas and would fight [with others]. [Such a so-called] buddha would say, ‘How can you [Drom] and I, if asked, not be equal? I am the son of such and such teacher; I am the nephew of so and so. Who is there that is more powerful than me in this monastery? Who is there in this region that I have not conferred empowerments upon?’ [49] Proclaiming that I foresee him or her to be the root of [virtue for] the benefactors, such a person would give titles of‘lama’ and ‘master’ to some young boy or girl who is not even capable of wiping his or her own nose clean. Say that one or two who are ignorant of the [most basic] ethical norms of affirmation and rejection167 and are fraught with the numerous afflicted forms of meditation practice call this person a teacher, a buddha, they might feel ‘I, too, am so and so.’ Such a guide may himself be an excellent meditator, but as for the Buddha’s enlightened task, he would have failed to lead even a single sentient being [to liberation].“Furthermore, some, while claiming to be Mahayanists, assert that you cover no ground by means of the lesser meditation practice of the disciples. They label others who adhere to a disciplined lifestyle, such as the teacher Atiáa—who are pure in their morality, modest in their desires, and easily contented, who are outwardly appealing due to practicing the twelve cul­tivated qualities in places of utter solitude, who are internally endowed with the awakening mind, and whose mindsteams are enriched by the per­fect factors of secret mantra—as [practitioners] of the Lesser Vehicle, [call­ing them] ‘disciples’ and so on.“Others, while discarding for the time being the precious ethical disci­pline as found in the three scriptural baskets— the ultimate foundation of all higher qualities— pretend to enter the Mantra Great Vehicle. Though failing to succeed in its practice, they claim to be tantric adepts, maintain a household, and clad themselves in saffron robes [as well]. With arrogance"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r j 105they go to [sit at the] head of a row. With no shame they call the fruit of their moral degeneration ‘noble sons’ and seat them at the head of the rows of fully ordained monks of Säkaymuni’s order. Thus we have ‘discipline norms,’ and it only takes one or two [transgressing such norms] to cause the downfall of many.‘‘[In general] what greater wonder is there than the Secret Mantra Great Vehicle? If you were to become a great glory and savior of beings as described in the tantras on the basis of the auspicious confluence of good karmic fortune and readiness, nothing would be greater. This would indeed be a great wonder. If, on the contrary, you were to commit many acts that undermined the pledges, then there are mechanisms [in the tantra that would result in] epidemics of numerous illnesses across the land. Rains could fail to fall on time, wars and internal strife could proliferate.1S* With no gain at all people could be swept away by dangers.“To summarize: The profound secret mantra must be concealed well from those who are unsuitable vessels. Since no [path] is hailed more than this for the attainment of buddahood, it should be revealed to those who are suitable vessels in secluded places. Engage in the three rites of praising, honoring, and hailing, and create the mandala within. No matter how pro­found it may be, [this secret mantra] is encompassed by the three scriptural baskets. As it is revealed and taught on the basis of recognizing the afflic­tions’ stream-like continuity as the object to be abandoned, [50] one’s men­tal continuum is transformed into a true Sangha Jewel; and since it actually generates ones mental continuum into a Sangha Jewel, it is [in fact] the generation stage.“Next recognize all sentient beings as your actual mothers and, through the four immeasurable [thoughts], generate this [recognition of others as mothers] as far as possible. Traversing the grounds and paths in their re­spective sequence through to extraordinary awakening is also the genera­tion stage. Then, investigating the objects of knowledge in terms of their specific and general characteristics by means of the four great logical rea­sons, recognize all phenomena without exception— unique particulars and generally characterized [phemonena]— as primordially empty, as uncre­ated by causes and conditions, and as great emptiness, the ultimate mode of being, which is free of conceptual elaborations. This is the completion stage.“Again, everything is in the nature of mind, the mind is in the nature of emptiness, and emptiness is in the nature of primordial emptiness, devoid"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"io6 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mof conceptual elaborations. This is transcendent wisdom. Since this is stated to be the Buddha, no divinity is greater than the Buddha. To attain perfection as the ultimate divinity—the great Buddha— is the completion stage. Alternatively, the recognition of all phenomena as dream-like and illusion-like is the generation stage, while the realization of them as devoid of conceptual elaboration and being within the nature of the ultimate truth is the completion stage.“To summarize: Is tantra encompassed within the generation and com­pletion stages or not? If so, then they are sufficient and you must practice them. There is no need for a tantra that is not encompassed within the gen­eration and completion stages.“Furthermore, is tantra encompassed within [the teachings on] moral­ity? If so, then it is [part of] the higher training in morality. Since it is the scriptural basket of Vinaya discipline that presents [the training in] moral­ity, [tantra] does not lie outside of discipline. If, [on the other hand] it is not encompassed in morality, a teaching that lacks such a foundation will not endure for long. Who wants a teaching with no foundation!“Again, is tantra encompassed in the training in mind [stabilization]?165 If so, since it is the scriptural basket of the sutras that presents [this higher training], tantra does not lie outside the bounds of the basket of the sutras. If [on the other hand] it is not encompassed, a path that lacks activity, [which resembles] the shallow crossing points [of a river], is difficult to tra­verse.170 For if you lack excellent activity, which is the crossing point of the path, you will not arrive at the final destination, the resultant state. Cast aside the teaching that has no training in mind, lacks activity and perfect paths, and is devoid of the fruition in buddhahood.“Furthermore, is tantra encompassed in the training in wisdom? If it is, in which one of the two— contaminated wisdom or uncontaminated wis­dom—is it encompassed? If it is encompassed within both, since it is the [scriptural basket of] higher knowledge that presents them, tantra is thus encompassed in the scriptural basket of higher knowledge. [51] If it is not encompassed within the two wisdoms— the contaminated and the uncon­taminated— then cast aside that tantra that is not [part of] wisdom. Whichever of the two wisdoms it may be encompassed within, it remains within the bounds of [the scriptural basket of] higher knowledge.“Thus, in order to set forth the presentation of the training in morality there is the discipline [basket]; in order to set forth the presentation of the trainings in mind and of wisdom there is, respectively, the sutra [basket]"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r 5 107and higher knowledge [basket]. These are known as the three baskets o f scripture. Whether good or bad, these are the three baskets of [the Bud­dha’s] sacred words. Based on these, the treatises [pertaining to the] three baskets came into being.“In order to summarize the entire discussion, tomorrow the teacher will give a teaching according to which the entire [path] can be practiced together in a single sitting on the basis of subsuming the mental levels of the persons of three categories. Even the teachings of the Secret Mantra Great Vehicle must be [part of] these three trainings. If it is not so and a secret mantra [teaching] is not encompassed within these three [train­ings]—that is to say, it is not within morality, it is not within mind, and it is not within wisdom— it is [then] highly flawed. If the tantras, in their entirety, are condensed, none is apart from the three baskets, nor are there three baskets that are not tantra. O great Atis'a, therefore, the following is my opinion.“By undertaking the Dharma practice of the Sangha, the fruition of buddhahood comes about. ‘Sangha’ refers to someone who is endowed with ethical discipline. To observe excellent ethical discipline you must have an excellent knowledge of discipline; to observe a middling level of ethical discipline you must have a middling knowledge of discipline; in fact, even to observe the four root precepts, the knowledge of the four root precepts is indispensable. Therefore, since [the survival of] the Buddha’s teaching depends upon the Sangha community, the Sangha community depends upon [the survival of] the sublime teachings of discipline, and [the survival of] Vinaya discipline depends upon the discipline upholders, I shall, out of my concern for the Buddha’s teaching, take the sublime teaching of Vinaya discipline as one of my chosen Dharmas.“All profound features—such as the provisional meaning [versus] the definitive meaning, and the ways the buddhas and their children endured hardships in the past [while on the path]— are found in the surras. There­fore, I will also take the [basket of] sutras to be one of my chosen Dharmas.“We are not versed in the concealed truths, nor do we possess unob­structed superknowledge. So to present the world of the knowable realm, it is on the basis of [the basket of] higher knowledge that even ordinary beings can have the knowledge of the size and shape of Mount Meru, the four continents, the trichiliocosm, and so on. Therefore, I will also, while focusing on enlightenment, take the higher knowledge [basket] to be one of my chosen Dharmas.

I will enhance their mindstreams with the three scriptural baskets and help to completely fulfill the Buddhas teachings.\"As Drom reinforced these thoughts and fervently dwelled on them, the four divinities appeared before him. Atis'a also said: “O eldest son, your meditation will be enhanced. Practice again and again, for your choice of teachings is most excellent. Just as you have thought, nothing among the entire secret mantras exists that is not encompassed in these [three baskets]. This class of teachings is highly profitable and carries minimal risk. This class of teachings is skilled in means and great in wisdom. This class of teachings leads to success [on the path].”After Atis'a made these statements, the four divinities proclaimed:“Most excellent one, you who care for the common purpose,Discipline teachings produce the highest divinity of the ethically disciplined;Sutra teachings produce the highest divinity of the noble ones;Knowledge teachings produce the highest divinity of the conquerors.This is so from the perspective of their principal [functions].In reality, all three teachings produce supreme conquerors.“These baskets of knowledge teachings lack nothing.Through excellent instructions revealing the path of the Emerge innumerable trainees with pure mental streams.Your choice of profound sacred words is unmistaken, O They are secure throughout all three times—beginning,May all be blessed to possess these three teachings.“Do not doubt but strive in your meditative practice.You who traverse the path of the final vehicle,Do not waver with lingering doubts now but strive in meditative practice.We [who are in] the thoroughly pure celestial palaceHarbor no excessive doubts but strive in our meditative practice.O son, after thoroughly discarding doubts,Choose the profound mantra well, O most excellent one!three trainingsmaster.171 middle, and end."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a rla n d , o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r j 109“‘Secret’ is not an indication of the teaching’s defect;Though it is hailed for the attainment of buddhahood,It is difficult for those ordinary vessels to master it.In perfect consonance with your vessel, O son,Seek the mandala of secret mantra within.”Speaking these lines they disappeared into the perfectly clear skies.Again Atis'a spoke:“Son, have no excessive doubts but uphold the scriptural baskets;For your ultimate welfare this alone is(the most excellent.

His laziness is to blame.Likewise, ignorant people,When they have obtained a precious human life,Fail to view the forms of happiness and misery.When, due to their faults, they are born in the lower realms,They fail to feel remorse.

I request, therefore, the methods to accomplish this aspiration.”Then Drom made an appeal:“In the retreat of Nyethang Orma,To relieve the upâsaka’s sadness,In the masters presence I make this appeal.Attend to me, source of benefit and joy.“Such is the degeneration of this era of strife;For the sake of powerless beings, out of your great altruism,You have arrived here from the land of India,Having been prophesized by deities and teachers.Grateful indeed am I that you have cared for me.Now I seek the practicesThat will completely unite all ultimate aims.No matter how you look at it, there is no time for leisure.”Atis'a replied: “Yes, I have a great method.

So, as explained earlier, make supplications to the teachers and meditation deities in a secluded place. Integrate the three baskets in their entirety into the [pracdces of the persons of] the three scopes.175 Do not allow the märas of sloth and mental dullness to come in. With your three doors [of body, speech, and mind] and, with great joyful perseverance, make elaborate offerings of the seven limbs176 to the divinities and teachers who have appeared in space before you. Cultivating fervent faith and respect toward them, visualize your teachers and the meditation deities as inseparable, just like the two of us here engaged in conversation. [58]“Upâsaka, the teachers and meditation deities possess great compassion. The teaching is most potent, and you have the ring177 of faith and respect. So, as you have just said, discard entirely all lingering doubts, and with resolve, thinking, ‘Now even if this body of mine were to be split into a hundred pieces, I will not forsake this meditative practice,’ cherish your meditative practice with persistence.“As for entering into the actual practice, sit upon a comfortable cushion and adopt a good posture. Taking sentient beings as your focus, perform perfectly the practice of going for refuge. For the benefit of others, gener­ate the mind [aspiring] for supreme awakening. Then, while holding fast your mind, [perform the following visualization]:“In your heart, a white lotus arises from the melting of a white [letter] pam. Within the center of the lotus, generate a letter äh, which is a medium-sized drop. When this melts, generate a moon disc that is about the same size. Next, upon the moon disc, visualize hrih and om, either white or yellow, and generate me as your teacher, indivisible from the med­itation deity. Fasten your mind on this single-pointedly. Guard the doors of the eye sense faculty, and do not project it out to external forms. Guard the doors of the ear sense faculty and do not project it out to external sounds. Likewise, do not let your nose, tongue, body, or mind become caught in the conceptualizations of smell, taste, or tactile sensation.“Through mindfulness, ensure that you do not lose [the visualization of] your teacher; through meta-awareness, make this firm; and through heedfulness, [cultivate] perfect faith and respect [toward your teacher]. Then, hold your mind firmly on [the image of] your teacher, who is the size of a barley grain, and who, brilliant and pure, emits perfectly clear light rays of five or she colors into the ten directions. After mentally paying horm age and making offerings to him, make the following supplication:178"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"il6 T h e B o o k o fK a d a m‘“Help me so that the subtlest of subtle defects from beginningless lives in cyclic existence up to the present life become purified.“‘Bless me so that I too can associate with all the conquerors of the ten directions, who, for the benefit of the trainees, never waver even for an instant, but enter the path of wisdom and compassion. Free of attachment and aversion toward them, may I, through exclusively pure perceptions, develop perfect rejoicing. I appeal to [the conquerors] to turn the unsur­passed wheel of Dharma.“‘Bless me so that, the instant 1 request it, everything that is good throughout all three times— including even material objects like grasses, trees, and caves— reveals the Dharma and turns [the wheel of Dharma]. [59] “‘Bless me so that, the instant I supplicate all the conquerors and their children not to enter nirvana, they appear before each and every sentient being, revealing the teachings to them in accordance with their needs and gradually leading them [to enlightenment] until cyclic existence is emptied.“‘Again bless me so that all the roots of virtue that I have dedicated become free of any conditions causing their exhaustion. By traversing the ten [bodhisattva] levels in their graded sequence, unobstructed by any obstacles, may I become fully enlightened for the sake of all sentient beings.“‘Again bless me so that, whatever aspiration prayers I make for sentient beings come to pass immediately, the instant that I pray them, in accor­dance with their wishes. Bless me so that I am free of the fetters of self- grasping that obstruct the realization of these [aspirations]. Bless me so that, after pacifying the inner disease175 of grasping at things and their signs, and after becoming the great middle way [residing] at the heart of the thor­oughly nonabiding great middle way,180 I will abide like the great vajra- holder who is the reality of the Three Jewels and is the buddha body that is free of [all] conceptual elaborations.’“Make repeated supplications in this manner. Make repeated aspiration prayers, saying, ‘May these be realized as [aspired for].’ Likewise, motivate yourself through repeated [applications of] mindfulness; be sustained by introspective awareness; and, through heedfulness, conduct yourself in accord [with these supplications]. Similarly, Upäsaka, concentrate your mind entirely not just during the day, not just during the night, but dur­ing the three phases of the day and the three phases of the night. At this point, do not search for too many ‘profound’ [teachings]. At this point, when you are stitching with method and wisdom, do not [sew] with a two­pronged needle. At this point, when you are practicing many profound"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r $ 117[teachings] in one sitting in a concentrated manner, harbor no doubts in your mind that split its tip into two. Cherish your persistent effort in med- itadve practices.“So, thoroughly abandoning sloth, mental dullness, and laziness, and with great force of joyful perseverance ensuring the perfect confluence of mindfulness, meta-awareness, and heedfulness, hold your mind in this manner throughout the six [phases of] time. Probing your mental contin­uum as well, see whether there has been a breach in your practice of going for refuge to the teacher and meditation deities; see whether you have cast aside meditative practice because of doubts; see whether you have been swept away by obstacles such as sloth, mental dullness, and laziness; see whether you have severed attachment to your own desires; and see whether your [pursuit of] others’ welfare has become partial.“Of all the thoughts you pursue in this way, the part that has past has no substantial reality, the part that is in the future has no substantial real­ity, [60] and their present has no substantial reality as well. Abiding in such intrinsic emptiness, the absence of substantial reality— this middle way of intrinsic emptiness— is called wisdom. Holding your mind on the teacher and so on is called method.“What is the significance of generating the teacher’s body as so minis­cule? This has the purpose of holding your mind with clarity such that con­ceptualizations do not proliferate. It is also easier if you dissolve [the mind] into the ultimate expanse of reality and so on, or into the letters. Upäsaka, this, is the first drop.“Furthermore, it will not suffice to say, ‘I will practice when there is more time, more leisure.’ What is there that is more important than this [Dharma practice]? If [you chink] there is something more important than this, miras have entered [your heart]. So without allowing the miras to enter, visualize your teacher, who is about the size of a barley grain. In the center of his heart, a yellow lotus arises from a yellow pam. At the center [of the lotus], a moon disc that is approximately the same size arises from a white ¿//about the height of a medium-sized drop. Arising from a yellow om, the Sage—who is about the size of the teacher as [visualized] earlier— sits upon this [moon disc]. [Meditate on him and venerate him] in the manner described earlier in the context of the teacher.1*1 This, then, is the second drop.“Moreover, in the heart of this barley grain—sized Sage, a greenish blue lotus arises from a greenish blue pam.

Upon this [moon disc], a greenish blue tarn becomes Tärä about the size of the Sage as described earlier. [Meditate on her and venerate] her also in the manner described earlier in the context of the teacher.“In the heart of this Tara as well, a white lotus arises from a white pam. At its center, a moon disc of about the same size arises from a white äh about the height of a medium-sized drop. Upon this [moon disc], there is a white hrïh, which in turn becomes Avalokitesvara the size of Tärä described earlier. [Meditate on him and venerate] him also in the manner described in the context of the teacher.“Likewise, in Avalokites'vara’s heart a lotus appears from a pam , and from an äh appears a moon disc upon which is a smoky blue hum. It, in turn, [becomes] Acala about the size of a barley seed. Focus on this and hold your mind. Until cyclic existence becomes empty, engage in the same [practices] as described earlier. Malte supplications consonant with such aspirations as continuously safeguarding the Buddhas teaching for a long time and thwarting obstacles presented by the forces of malevolence.”At this juncture, the upäsaka asked, “What hand implements should I adopt?”“To whom do you malte supplications?” Atisa asked.“That depends on whatever is most primary [at a given moment],” he responded.[Atis'a replied:] “In that case, it is okay to visualize each of them as hav­ing one face and two arms. [61] Yet, there is no contradiction if you visu­alize Tärä as having eight arms and Great Compassion [Avalolites'vara] as having one thousand arms and one thousand eyes, and so on. As for their sitting postures, it is okay to visualize all of them as similar. Alternatively, you can also visualize Tärä in half lotus [position] and Acala with his left leg outstretched and his right leg bent. Also, since this is in the context of [engaging in] meditative absorption, it is stated that if you visualize all of them in the cross-legged vajra [lotus] position, it is a great blessing.” Again Drom asked: “How can I make supplications in the fashion of a destitute person seeking some prosperity?”Ati¿a replied: “You can visualize [the divinities] as carrying alms bowls filled with ambrosia or precious jewels, and so forth. Furthermore, you can also visualize [Tärä] as the savior from eight terrors and so forth,182 with hand implements and postures just as found elsewhere. Nevertheless, since todays teaching is an instruction on holding your mind, do not engage in"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p te r $ 119excessive elaboration. You can visualize all of them as seated cross-legged and as having one face and two arms. They are small, clear, radiant, and transparent, such that blessings flow the instant you make supplications to them. As for the other [divinities], [their appearances, postures, and hand implements] will be revealed in the context of their individual generation stage [meditations].“From now on, throughout all activities such as walking, sitting, and so on, unless you are repeatedly reinforcing [in your mind clearly] the five drops“3 referred to earlier, do not act [without deliberation], walking casu­ally and so on. If, however, you wish to do so, visualize the dissolution [of the divinities as follows] : Acala dissolves into his seed syllable and, through a gradual process, he dissolves, together with his seat, into Avalokites'vara. Continue to dissolve them in the same manner, up until Sâkyamuni. When you come to the remaining sole, vivid image of Atisa, pay homage and make offerings to him.“Then, as you project your five senses slightly from the objects, think: ‘Like a dream, an illusion, and a reflection, objects appear yet cannot be clung to. If everything in this blurred, surreal [world] is, in this manner, false, deceptive, and unreal, then my parents are suffering with no purpose. What a pity! What a pity! It is up to me. I must ensure their happiness; I must ensure their well-being. How I wish they could be swifdy placed within [the state of] buddhahood! How joyful it is that I have the oppor­tunity to work for their welfare, that I have the knowledge of the ultimate mode of being, and that I can make supplications to the higher beings.’ Thinking in this way, practice the four immeasurable thoughts. Again, these are the method while the inner meditations are wisdom. Upâsaka, it is important never to be divorced from these two— method and wisdom. [62] This is what I understand to be the meaning of the line ‘Divert not your six senses to the objects.’”“4To this, Drom replied: “It is most kind of you. Today, I have received an excellent method of meditating on the divine teachings.” He then stated:“Though the teacher has given many teachings,If I summarize, it is as follows:With mindfulness, awareness, and heedfulness,Constantly guard the gateways of your senses.Again and again, three times both day and night,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"izo T h e B o o k o fK a d a mExamine the flow of your thoughts.“There is nothing other than this.”Atis'a replied, “Drom, it is as you have stated. You are skilled at summa­rizing it all. So, if you were to write a general summary of all the teachings I have given up until today, how would you state this?”[Drom answered:] “I understand it to be the following:Homage to great compassion;Homage to the teachers;Homage to the faith divinities.Discard all lingering doubtsAnd strive with dedication in your practice.Thoroughly relinquish sloth, mental dullness, and laziness,And strive always with joyful perseverance.With mindfulness, awareness, and heedfulness,Constantly guard the gateways of your senses;Again and again, three times both day and night,Examine the flow of your thoughts.“O teacher, are [all your teachings] encompassed in these [lines] ?”Atis'a replied: “Yes, very well so. I, too, maintain this to be so. When I urged you to do this, you responded that you would do so, and your pres­entation is excellent.”[Drom said:] “Teacher, up to this point, it appears that [your teaching has] presented how to discard lingering doubts and accomplish your ulti­mate aim.”This concludes the fifth chapter from the Jew el G arland o f Dialogues, “How to Guard the Doors of the Senses and Hold Your Mind.”"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Ch a p t e r 6How All Blame Lies in a Single Point[63] On another occasion when father Atiáa and his son were staying at their residence at Nyethang Or, Drom prostrated to Atisa and, recollecting the method of holding one’s mind and so forth, [stated:]“Ignorance, craving, and grasping are the causes of sentient beings. Voli­tion and becoming serve as their conditions, while their effects are con­sciousness, name and form, the six sense fields, contact, feelings, birth, and aging and death.185 So it is these three— causes, conditions, and effects—that alone turn the wheel of impurity throughout the universe. Covering all our own defects with our palms, we unearth all the frailties of others with our fingers. Students do not implement the teachers words and sons do not listen to what their fathers tell them. O great Atisa, a neg­ative era has dawned. Although sentient beings share the experience of the impure cycle of the twelve links of dependent origination, the beings of this degenerate era are partaking individually in what is a common resource. Since it could potentially benefit one or two future trainees, I request you to give a brief explanation of the twelve links of dependent origination.” Atis'a replied, “I shall explain this later when we have to lift our robes because of muddy water.”“In that case, what is the root of bondage?” asked Drom.Atiáa: “It is the grasping at self.”“What is this grasping at self?” enquired Drom.“This is something that wants all positive qualities for oneself alone and wants others alone to take on all misfortunes.”“Then please explain this in such a manner so you can say ‘This is self- grasping,’” asked Drom.Atisa replied: “Where would one find something of which it could be said that ‘This is the reified self-grasping?”’“In that case, please explain to me how it is that [this self-grasping] wants everything and transfers [all] blames onto others.”Atis'a replied, “Upasaka, why even ask me? This is pervasive in sentient beings. You know this, so what need is there to ask? Even so, I have also seen attachment and aversion labeled as self-grasping.”"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"122 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m“Atis'a, there are people who possess such forms of grasping?”“Where do they exist?” responded Atisa. [64]“They are [within] our own mental continuum,” replied [Drom]. “Upäsaka, what is one’s own mental continuum?”“It is that which wants everything and grasps [at it all]replied Drom. Atis'a: “I, too, would say the same.”“Where does this self-grasping reside?” inquired Drom.“It is devoid of parts, and I have never seen it myself. There is nothing that abides where there is nowhere to abide. I do not know the colors and shapes of something with no reality,” replied [Atis'a].Drom then asked, “If this is so, how can something so feeble exist?” Atisa responded, “Can’t one perceive mirage water, a double moon, dream horses and elephants, and so on?”“Master, these are delusions.”Atis'a said, “I accept this to be so. It is not that he, self-grasping, indulges in attachment and aversion on the basis of being existent. Dogs bark in the wilderness because of an empty container, and our mindstream is greatly perturbed with no ground [at all].”“Master, if such are the examples, self-grasping seems to be something that never existed at all,” said Drom.“What is this thing that ‘seems to be’? It must be real.”“Master, in that case do the forms and functions of the abyss of the three lower realms, the qualities of the higher realms, and the ethical norms of affirmation and rejection [also] exist?”“There is a dreamer of dreams. Isn’t there?” Atis'a responded.“Master, this is not the same. Dreams are not created by oneself. Though false, they arise [spontaneously]. Birth in the higher realms, lower realms, ethical norms of affirmation and rejection were created.”“Who created them?” asked Atis'a.“They were created by the mind,” replied [Drom].“I, too, would say the same. Dreams are also created by the mind, Upäsaka, for were they not created by the mind, who created them? Are they created by some other thing? For were they not created by something else or by the mind, Upäsaka, then you have lied about what is itself a lie. The objects of dreams are false; they are devoid of all [characterizations], such ais self, other, and so on. In the same manner, even the ethical norms of affirmation and rejection, such as [the causes for talcing birth in] the lower realms and so on, are conjured by the mind itself, which then does the affirming and rejecting.”"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r 6 123“If this is so, is self-grasping the root of attachment and aversion, and this is ones own mind?” asked Drom.“What is the color of the mind?” asked Atis'a.“I have never seen it.”“Then what kind of shape does it have?” asked Atis'a.“Master, I have never seen it.”“Since it exists with neither color nor shape, [65] and also since it has never been seen with the eyes, this indicates that it does not exist as a form. So empty it of physicality and set it aside. Upäsaka, what type of sound does it have, melodious or unmelodious, loud or muffled?”“Master, I have never heard it before,” replied Drom.“So since it does not appear as melodious or unmelodious, loud or muffled, and so on, it is not heard by the ears. Given that if it does exist [as sound], it should be audible to the ears, and [given that it is not heard], it does not exist. Now that the mind is devoid also of sound, set it aside. Upäsaka, what type of smell does it have, fragrant or unfragrant?”“Master, I have never smelled an odor of the mind or mind itself,” replied Drom.“Drom, had it an odor there is no doubt it would have been smelled by the nose. Given that it has never been smelled, this indicates that the mind is devoid of smell. So set aside this emptiness that is the absence of smell. Drom, does your mind exist as some kind of taste, be it delicious or unsavory?”“All sorts of things seem to emerge from the master’s speech. How can there be such a norm186 [pertaining to] the distinction between a delicious or unsavory taste on the basis of eating the mind?” exclaimed Drom.“Drom, in that case, does the mind not exist?”“Master, how can there be the eating of mind, and how can there be the tasting of mind?” asked Drom.“Drom, this is an indication that your mind is not a taste. For were it a taste, the tongue would experience it. As it is not experienced by the tongue, this indicates that it is not a taste. So set aside that which is devoid also of taste. Drom, what kind of tactile quality does the mind have, soft or coarse?”“Master, I have never seen the tactile quality of the mind,” he replied.“Drom, why is this so?”“There is no norm pertaining to observing the tactile quality of the mind,” replied Drom."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"124 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mAtisa then responded: “Normlessness abounds in sentient beings who are wild. Given that the mind is not an object of tactile experience, this is an indication that it is devoid of tactile quality. So set aside the mind that is also not a tactile phenomenon. Drom, what kind of things exist as the object of mental consciousness?”“Master, in order for something to appear as an object of mental con­sciousness, it seems that the senses need to have an immediately preceding condition. For without first becoming the object of the senses, there is no immediately preceding condition that is the object of mental consciousness.”“Fabrications of conceptualization can appear, too,” responded Atis'a.“Master, even fabrications are preceded by their propensities. Fur­thermore, isn’t the entailment, ‘Because something is not an object of the five senses, it does not exist as any of the five sense objects’ a little too sweeping?”“Upäsaka, what are you saying? I have not listed all objects to be within these [five sense objects]. I have [only] listed your mind in addition to these [sense objects]. For if the mind exists as any of these [five sense objects], then when you observe it, it should exist as a form, be heard as a sound, and so on. [66] Since it is not perceived as any of these, where does the mind reside? Upäsaka, even ordinary mundane people would give up and shake their hands and exclaim ‘I have never seen such a thing with my eyes, nor have I heard it with my ears. I have never smelled its odor, never tasted its flavor, nor does it exist anywhere within [the sphere of] mental con­sciousness.’ You, [on the other hand,] are a person who has been ripened by the pith instructions of the sublime teachers, in whose heart the higher attainments of the meditation deities have entered, and a person who practices the three baskets of the sacred words in one sitting. So you [of all people] should not add meaningless branches and leaves [onto a non­existent tree].“All of this is the mind. I have realized this nature of mind, for I am a son of Avadhuti. Now even if one’s faults are exposed, it is the mind. Even if one is praised, it is the mind. Whether happy or sad, it is the mind. Given that all of these are equal in being the mind, whatever defects arise in your mental continuum wherein self is perceived when there is no self, crush them and let them go. There is no point in concealing such unestablished defects inside a cave that is [itself] not established. There is no point in turning these into poisons and causing illness.

Although dreams are unreal, it serves no purpose to dream of suffering.“Drom, cast out all these false defects. If the sign of having cleansed these defects is positive, this is fine; if it is not, this is fine too. Within this equality of [everything] being the appearance of an unreal mind, if others feel delighted when they are praised, go praise them. Do not search for another’s faults, for there is no searcher within you. If something is to be concealed at all, conceal your own higher qualities. The time has now come for this. If something is to be proclaimed at all, proclaim the higher qual­ities of others. Others will be delighted, and they will not accumulate neg­ative karma on the basis of you. This also has the benefit of dislodging the foundation stones of the afflictions, such as attachment and aversion. Whatever good qualities exist in others, seek out each of them individually and reveal them. Upâsaka, [now] do you understand how everything is the mind?”“Yes, I do,” replied Drom.“In that case, do you understand the mind’s true mode of being?”“Yes, I do,” replied Drom.Atis'a: “So what need is there of desires for this mind; cultivate content­ment. Even though you perceive many sentient beings, all of them are your fathers and mothers who have taken joys in your overcoming of misfortune and [attainment] of good fortune. They have cleaned your runny nose with their mouths, your excrement with their hands, have nurtured you with kingdoms and with gifts, and some, despite having been abandoned [by us], have cared for us again. [67] It is due to the kindness of the teacher that positive qualities are revealed. In general, it is the teacher who has done you the great kindness of granting you your ultimate aim. And it is your parents who are the source of great kindness granting you joy and happi­ness in this life. You should therefore recognize their kindness and repay their kindness.“For this, serve the teacher through respectful veneration and medita­tive practice, and toward your parents, in order to repay their kindness, cultivate immeasurable loving-kindness, immeasurable compassion, immea­surable joy when they are happy, and. immeasurable equanimity that is free of discriminating thoughts of near and distant.

[So] this [recognizing others’ kind­ness and repaying it] refers to a cousin of desire, whereby one has relinquished self-centeredness and generates kindheartedness desiring one’s parents [to have happiness] and desiring to repay their kindness.”Drom replied:“Though the master has given many excellent [teachings],If summarized, it is this:Reveal your own shortcomings,But do not seek out others’ errors.Conceal your own good qualities,But proclaim those of others.Forsake gifts and ministrations;At all times relinquish gain and fame.Have modest desires, be easily satisfied,And reciprocate kindness.Cultivate love and compassion,And stabilize your awakening mind.“There is nothing other than this.”Atis'a responded, “Yes, this is so.

In my aftermath, there will be all manner of spiritual trainees.”With his palms folded, Atisa responded, “Yes, my upâsaka is right. There will be one hundred, ten thousand,188 and twenty-five thousand [trainees].”“Most glorious one, yes, I am asking about the objects of abandonment for those [people].”“Upâsaka, if among your sons, nephews, and grandnephews it is rare for someone to engage even in the ten nonvirtuous actions, what need is there to speak of the five heinous acts and their approximations? Furthermore, those who are certain to follow in your footsteps will not engage in the heinous acts and their approximations regardless of whatever situation they confront. As for those who seek your liberating example, they are soiled not even by the ten negative actions.

According to the presentations of all the Higher Knowledge [texts], it seems to be a place from where there is no chance to escape to a higher state. As for the defects of the hells, [69] I shall explain them tomorrow, when we have to lift our robes [and cross to] the other shores.“Here, however, it is critical not to fall into the heinous acts. No matter what class of animals one may kill through poison, or weapons, or destruc­tive incantations, the karmic fruition [of such an act] is rebirth in one of the three lower realms. This is a karmic act that does not waver. Further­more, with respect to all classes of animals, if one either makes others per­form the killing or rejoices [in such an act], this karmic act leads to birth in the lower realms. So if one must not kill any being, from [the smallest] insect on a single blade of grass up to a human, what need is there to men­tion [not taking the life of] the distinguished objects?“Dromtönpa, if your body were to be pierced by three hundred or so spears continuously over a period of an entire day and not allowed to die, what kind of pain would you experience?”“Master, it would be unbearable,” replied Drom.“Drom, it is said that this would not measure up to even one hundredth or one thousandth of the least of the lesser sufferings of the hells. Drom, one must, therefore, never take a life; one must never make others kill, nor must one rejoice in killing, for even if one is reborn as a human, one’s life will be short.“Furthermore, one must not take, without being given, material things belonging to others, whether through force, incantations, or subterfuge. It is like this: Do not steal, do not rob, do not engage even in [such acts as] deceitful flattery and insinuation, for if one commits these, just as in the previous case, there is no path other than to the lower realms. Most of [those who commit these acts] are said to take birth as hungry ghosts."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"T h e J c i v e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r / 129Drom, even if a person is reborn as a human, he will be impoverished in resources and remain destitute. He will have obtained a human life, but just barely, with nothing to eat, nothing to be found, and nothing to wear.“Drom, one must not engage in any way in what is unchaste. One must never defile one’s relations, such as one’s mother or one’s sisters. One must never defile those who observe vows, such as a fully ordained nun. Fur­thermore, engaging in [sexual acts] during other inappropriate times, or during the day, or with other orifices is called sexual misconduct. Since these are causes for departing to the limitless lower realms, together with unchaste conduct one must never ever engage in these.IM Even if one is reborn as a human, one will suffer from grave family problems and expe­rience enormous heaps of suffering. In this context, as well, if one makes others commit such acts [70] or rejoices in them, [the karmic result] is the same as in the previous case [where one performed the act oneself].“Also, since telling lies [and indulging in] divisive speech, frivolous speech, and harsh words are major causes for taking birth in the limitless lower realms, one must relinquish them at all times and in all forms. Even if a person is reborn as a human, he will not be recognized by others as cred­ible. Many will disparage him, his words will carry no authority, and he will become an object of other’s ridicule. He will not be harmonious with others, and others will drive a wedge between the individual and his dear friends. He will greatly attract derision, and even those with no reason to will shout abusive words at him, and so on. He will thus be deprived of even the [normal] human joys.“One must, therefore, learn to seek the seven virtues that are the relin­quishments of these seven nonvirtues, and lead others to these seven virtues as well. One should also give compliments to those who cultivate these [virtues]. As for someone like you, Drom, who has secured a firm ground, who does not even care to take birth in cyclic existence, who focuses exclu­sively on other’s welfare, you can engage in the seven nonvirtues by relat­ing them to [the application of] skillful means. Those are [only] similitudes of nonvirtue.150“Drom, toward the possessions of others—should they be the posses­sions of teachers, of the Three Jewels, of the sick and disabled, and so on— one must never covet with the thought, ‘How happy I would be if I had them.’ One must not harbor covetousness with such thoughts as ‘How I wish I had them; I will try my very best to obtain them.’ This is prohibited even for bodhisattvas."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"130 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m“Also one must not ever harbor any harmful intention, such as gloating when others suffer misfortune, gloating when they experience destruction, or [conceiving] the intent to kill.“Furthermore, saying that the Buddha [Jewel] is untrue, that the Dharma is untrue, that the Sangha community is untrue, that there are no previous and future worlds, that there is no law of karma and its effects, and using the travails that befall spiritual practitioners as evidence [of such claims]— all of these are what is called harboring wrong views. With such karmic acts it is impossible to escape from the lower realms. One must, therefore, relinquish such [acts] in all their forms at all times.“Drom, I have presented here, by means of an illustrative summary, the ten nonvirtues together with their destructive effects. As for other [aspects], you should read the sutras closely. In the future as well, given that the minds of the ignorant trainees are confused, you should reveal to them this rough type of presentation. If it is too elaborate, it will not benefit the igno­rant trainees. So Gyalwai Jungné, take what I have stated earlier as your focus and never be angry or agitated. [71] Never be conceited with pride that impedes success. The instant that anger and agitation arise, crush them with their antidotes. Remain tranquil and disciplined with a demeanor of humility. Never at any time support yourself with ill means but be nur­tured throughout day and night through ethical livelihood.“Gyalwai Jungné, do you know this? Anger destroys the roots of virtue of many eons; conceitedness destroys the young shoots of the cultivation of heedfulness; wrong livelihood causes one to degrade the qualities of a virtuous person. Therefore, Drom, one must never commit any acts that are associated with the ten nonvirtues. This broad presentation [of the ethics of the ten virtues] is part of a dialogue carried out in a casual man­ner by the two of us. It is not the .time for [discussing] the numerous conflicts and connections [between these explanations]. Drom, do you find these [explanations] agreeable to your mind?”Drom responded: “Even though we would not have the time to engage in an extensive dialogue, it would certainly be fine if you, Atisa, were to give an excellent explanation that is comprehensive and extensive, that is lucid and substantive on all [the aspects of] the story of these ten nonvirtues. That is why I have brought this up in general terms in our conversation.” Atisa stated: “Drom, it is not that I do not know how to weave the words together.

Just as one seeks to accumulate a year’s provisions within months, now is the time to seek the long-term ulti­mate aim in this very life. And our approach is to take our share on a day- by-day basis. [Other than meeting with Dharma,] there is no other purpose for taking birth in a central region. I am delighted that the members of the Sangha have arrived without needing an invitation. This is a sign that the teachings will flourish.

Today, however, I, the benefactor Gyalwai Jungné, have been sent elsewhere, being made to point my finger inward. Since I meditate on impermanence throughout the day and night, I have no leisure to accumulate material things. So whenever the need arises, let’s search through the Sangha community’s storeroom, take from it, and consume these things.” So joyfully and delightedly he entertained and served the teacher and the Sangha well.At that time, Drom said: “When people gather in a samsaric gathering, satisfy them accordingly with the wealth of material things. Today, how­ever, we have gathered here as an assembly of enlightened phenomena.’ Thus, we should be enriched accordingly with the wealth of the noble ones.

Ask Drom; he is good at traveling around. He also loves [acts of] elaboration and withdrawal. Also, there must be a limit to space that one can speak of.”“What kind of [acts of] elaboration and withdrawal do I engage in?” asked Drom.“Drom, you engage in [acts of] elaboration the size of space.”“Master, you have the thought that I do, so please show us the limit of space.”“Drom, what are you talking about? I have never measured space.” “Master is telling a sudden lie. Having said that Drom engages in [acts of] elaboration the size of space, you are now claiming that you have never measured space.”“Drom, I said that you have [elaborations] the size of space, but I did not say that so much is the size of space.”“Master, if you say that Drom has elaborations the size of space, when this analogy is related to the actual fact, you must know both the analogy and fact [that you compared it to]. It is strange that you, a learned man, would make such correlations.”“Drom, you may be right this time. However, if, to say that something were equal to space, one had to comprehend space itself, there would be none who could use space as an analogy.”“Master, is this not a case of doing something while being ignorant? [154] An intelligence that discovers the limit of space is difficult to find indeed.” “Drom, who has measured that space-like ultimate nature of all phenomena?”“Master, here something measureless is used as an analogy.

Instead, it would be far more joy­ful if all sentient beings became human beings like me and were here in your presence to partake exclusively in the Mahayana teachings. However, as with attaining buddhahood on the basis of a female body, this seems to be rare.”As [Drom] made this statement, the blue-green lady appeared vividly in the form of a tathägatha. Master Atisa laughed and exclaimed, “What you have illuminated directly [for us] is an excellent form indeed!”“One who has already become fully enlightened can display any forms, both excellent and inferior. I was speaking of women who possess the fet­ters of the afflictions.”Then the goddess returned to her own form and asked, “Great Com­passion, whose afflictions are greater, mine or a those of a woman with the fetters of the afflictions? I, for one, carry the afflictions of all sentient beings while a woman who is fettered carries only her own share. Without relin­quishing the afflictions, one does not become fully enlightened, yet the afflictions are so extensive.”“In that case,” replied Drom, “I, too, am greatly afflicted, for I am car­rying space.”“Drom, there is nothing to carry of space,” [responded Tara].“Tara, there is no carrier either, so cast away everything into equanim­ity,” [said Drom].“What is it that carries the afflictions?” Drom asked Atis'a.“Drom, whoever possesses self-grasping.”“In that case, Tira does not have self-grasping, for she is liberated.

There­fore, it has been said:The long stream of the Buddhas teaching Is surrounded by eight untainted pools;Whosoever drinks from this [spring],All their sufferings shall be pacified.“O Gyalwai Jungné, [the long stream] is endowed with such excellent qualities. If it is hard for the imperfect sentient beings to even hear of this, whac need is there to speak of their inability to see it? They do not believe in the cause and effect of karma, and they lack the forbearance of the vol­untary acceptance of suffering.“Furthermore, in the eight directions—four cardinal and four-interme­diate directions—of the great palace, there are three sets of seven precious"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"3o8 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mlotus trees, each with one thousand branches and petals. Eighty and four [lotus trees] emerge there: one in each of the four cardinal directions and two [sets of ten] in each of the intermediate directions. Seated there in the form of youthful men and women, lay bodhisattvas and ordained bodhi- sattvas, equal in number to the lotus petals, release forth streams of water, perfecting the spiritual trainees. Therefore, it is said:In the four cardinal directions and the ordinal directions Are eighty-four lotus trees,All endowed with one thousand branches and petals.Assemblies of youthful bodhisattvas reside upon these,Releasing forth streams to fortunate trainees [179]And gathering forth immeasurable clouds as well.“O Gyalwai Jungné, 113 lotus trees of renown will emerge. Before them, three sets of seven springs endowed with eight qualities, such as the ‘excel­lent,’ ‘endowed with excellence,’ ‘joyful,’ ‘endowed with joyfulness,’ ‘stain­less,’ ‘sweetly perfumed,’ will also emerge, [all] magically created and blessed by thousands of youthful bodhisattvas. With one [single] set in each of the cardinal directions and two sets [of ten] in each of the inter­mediate directions, eighty-four springs will appear there. The sufferings of any being who drinks from this spring are brought forth into their very life­time and pacified. Therefore, it has been said:In all the directions, both cardinal and ordinal,There are eighty-four springs of good fortune Blessed by the youthful bodhisattvas;Whosoever drinks [from them] shall be free from all sufferings. “And,Furthermore, in all the cardinal and ordinal directions,There are pools blessed by hosts of youthful bodhisattvas— Endowed with eight excellent qualities, most auspicious And pleasurable, and scented with the perfume of Medicinal plants of 108 varieties.Whosoever drinks [from them] shall be free from all sufferings."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r 1 6 309“These [pools] are also equal in number to the number of springs. In brief, there are 113 pools.“Also, in the four cardinal directions of the great spring, there are twenty-four springs—six white-crystal springs, six yellow-gold springs, six red-copper springs, and six blue-turquoise springs. They exist as reservoirs of the six perfections and as a symbol of how all the buddhas of the three times have attained full perfect awakening by means of wisdom and skill­ful means on the basis of the six perfections. Such water is utilized only by the noble ones, for childish ordinary ones cannot partake of it. In all the cardinal and intermediate directions, there are, in total, a full 113 such springs endowed with excellent qualities. With 108 that the childish ordi­nary ones can see and five that they cannot see, all of these 1x3 springs are solely blessed and magically created springs. [180]“O Gyalwai Jungné, at the site where these 21,000 lotus trees and 226 springs exist, a monastery known as the glorious Radreng will appear as a holy site equal to Bodhgaya in the [kingdom of] Magadha and resembling the Dharma palace of Akanistha [buddha realm]. It will be vivid, tangible, as striking as a natural mandala of the tathägatas, as beautiful as a pitched umbrella of peacock feathers, and incessantly attractive. In front of this will be a turquoise lake, the color of deep sky blue, placed in the manner of a water-offering bowl for the tathägatas. In the summer there will be a meadow of precious jewels abiding like a turquoise mandala that is circu­lar and has a diameter of one yojana. Thirteen varieties of precious flowers will grow upon this. It will be arrayed with boulders ornamented by assorted precious stones strewn in the form of offerings to the tathägatas. In the fall there will be a golden mandala with a diameter of one yojana upon which thirteen varieties of precious flowers will grow. It will be arrayed with boulders ornamented by assorted precious stones strewn in the form of offerings to the tathägatas. In winter there will be a crystal man­dala with a diameter of one yojana that is arrayed with boulders orna­mented by assorted precious stones strewn in the form of an offering to the tathägatas. In the spring there will be a crystal mandala, marked with rec­tangular golden lines studded with turquoise jewels, that is arrayed with boulders ornamented by assorted precious stones strewn in the form of offerings to the tathägatas.“The seven precious mountains will surround this [mandala of Radreng] and dwell like offerings to the conquerors. On the precious ground, eight lotus petals will support the conquerors and remain there as an offering to"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"310 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mthem. The precious jewel [with its] eight spokes will be situated there as if pitching a parasol over the tathägatas. The eight lights—seven natural lights and the light of the sun and moon—will illuminate the tathägatas and remain there as an offering of light. The mountain of the precious queen will dwell as an offering of food to the tathägatas. The blue-clad Guardian of Secrets [Vajrapäni], composed of diamonds, will reside on the face of the mountains in the manner of a bodyguard of the tathägatas. In brief, in all the cardinal and intermediate directions will be auspicious sub­stances, [181] auspicious signs, and gods, inconceivable and innumerable, overpowering the earth-bound malevolent forces. The nature [of these deities] will be such that they are perceptible only to the noble ones. The gods will see mountains of precious stones. Some [beings] will see images of the tathägatas, some will see only the reflections of the symbols like the royal emblems, and some will see flowering trees, wish-granting trees, springs, pools, springs of ambrosia, and bathing pools. In brief, they will see the entire environment— the mountains and the valleys— as that of a celestial abode.“As for humans, there are two types— those with pure karma and those with impure karma. Of these two, those with pure karma will see, without error: the environment in its directional location, the mountains and val­leys as perfectly formed, and the forests of junipers in full flourish. Thus, they will see the lakes, trees, and everything as perfect and as sources of enjoyment. They will also see Mount Meru as vast, lofty, and as having six peaks— three lower peales on the right and two lower peaks on the left, with the center towering high above [the other peaks]. Below this [they will see] an even wider green valley, beneath which will be three smaller mountains, the right and left of which will be two flat crystal mountains. In the east and west, there will be slightly thinner juniper forests. Slightly below these [forests] will be two springs below which will be a large spring. In front of this spring, they will see a large monastery such as the one [men­tioned earlier]. Below this, there will be a long and powerful river, a large valley with many rocks strewn about, and a region with many hillocks, with its upper and lower parts being a bit narrow and its lower base being circular like a roasting pan.335 They will see that the sun rises early and sets late [in these valleys]. Seeing in such light, everyone with intelligence will praise it.“O Gyalwai Jungné, construct your monastery there. There your disci­ples will gather as well.

Some will be known by a bodhisattva’s name, some by an arhat s name, some by the name of loving-kindness (Naljorpa Jampai Lodro),13<s some by Säkya’s name (Khamlungpa Shäkya Yönten), and some by the name ofWangchuk (Gönpawa Wangchuk Gyaltsen). Some will be known by the name of concentration, while some will be known by the name of wisdom (Naljorpa Sherap Dorjé). [182] In this way, many [disciples] with meaningful names will converge. All of them will work perfectly for the welfare of sentient beings and will uphold your sacred lineage without degeneration. In particular, there will be three (the three brothers) who will ensure that the blood line of the Three Jewels does not come to an end. One (Putowa Rinchen Sal) will uphold the treatises of the Buddhas teach­ing; one (Chengawa Tsiiltrim Bar) will extract the distilled juice of the instructions; and one (Phuchungwa Shönu Gyaltsen) will destroy his inner untamed [ego]. In brief, they will help disseminate the Kadam widely. These are the humans of pure karma.“The humans of impure karma will disparage your sacred lineage. They will not come to that site and will not see it. They will not discern the law of karma and its effects and will fail to understand the truth of the ultimate mode of being. Therefore, they will not become your prospective spiritual trainees. For if sentient beings lack fortune, even the buddhas [have to] leave them alone.“Again, Gyalwai Jungné, the obstacles [created by] malevolent demons are numerous. If [such obstacles] were to ever occur there at your site, they could obscure the law of the dependent origination of karma for some dis­ciples who have feeble minds. Some who have drunk from the magically created water and have brought forth [future] sufferings [into the present] might defame the water and not see the bringing forth of their suffering. Failing to understand the subdeties of the law of karma, they might gen­erate wrong views. Failing to carefully guard their ethical discipline, they might go to the lower realms. Before too long, however, this magically cre­ated water will help free them.”After these prophesies had been made, Drom spoke:“Master, though you have said much in response to my queries,If I were to put in a nutshell it is this:Dwell utterly in solitude, beyond town limits.Like the carcass of a wild animal,"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"311 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mHide yourself away [in the forest]And live free of attachment.“There is nothing other than this.”This concludes the sixteenth chapter of the Jew el G arland o f Dialogues, “How He Engaged in the Hidden Conduct and So On.”"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Ch a p t e r i7Not Forsaking the Pledges and the Excellence of the Perfect Spiritual Tradition[183] On another occasion, at that very same place and in the presence of the teacher, our teacher [Dromtönpa], the perfect spiritual friend, said: “O sublime teacher, pray listen.“The excellent Dharma of ever-increasing virtue—You’ve given this to me for a pure liberating way of life.The Three Jewels, who are the unrivaled divinities—You’ve given these to me as ornaments of a pure liberating life.“Discipline, which is the ground of all excellent qualities—You’ve given this to me as the field of a pure liberating life.The treasury of the mines of inexhaustible Dharma—You’ve given this to me as the heritage of a pure liberating life.“The healing medicinal tree with one thousand branches—You’ve given this to me as the medicine of a pure liberating life.The skill of turning whatever one does always into virtue—You’ve given this to me as the conduct of a pure liberating life.The river stream of profound spiritual teachings—You’ve given this as a source of bliss and enjoyment for me, a golden bird.“The precious ocean of pith instructions is beneficial and [a source of] happiness;The plains on its shores are replete with sands of gold;Its perimeters are adorned with thousands of beautiful ornaments.As an object of affection for my Kadam,You’ve given me this well-spoken [teaching] holding the mind’s goodness.“O, in the celestial mansions of the Tusita realm,The mighty Indra possesses a great wealth of riches;He is thoroughly venerated by the lesser Indra-like gods.Such is the immeasurable pleasure of the heavenly realm."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"314 The Book ofKadam“Likewise, in the celestial mansion of my Kadam,The spiritual wealth of the three higher trainings prospers spontaneously.

In the future as well, they will take birth in the three lower realms. Failing to realize this, they completely indulge in the mundane concerns of this life alone and fail to undertake anything for the benefit of future lives. Why is this so?”“Drom, imagine a greedy man is walking across a vast desolate plain car­rying a heavy load with nothing to use as a prop to support the load. If he sits down, he will not be able to stand up again; yet, if he does not sit down he will be utterly exhausted. Because it shifts back and forth constantly, the heavy load becomes tilted, yet he is unable to adjust it. As he continues on his journey in immense agony, he finds a rare support to lean upon, so he takes a rest and experiences great pleasure. Becoming attached to the pleas­ure, he does not rearrange the load, but takes a nap and then resumes his journey, carrying the load as it was. Before he gets far, the thought occurs to him, ‘Alas, what kind of person am I? When taking a rest I did not rearrange my load. Now I am struck in this desolate terrain and, if I were to rearrange my load, I would not be able to get up. Yet, I feel so desperate to rearrange it.’ He may feel totally lost as to what to do, but by then it’s too late. [195] “Likewise, Drom, in the past these people have suffered in the vast des­olate terrain of the lower realms. Without any ease with which to move on, sit down, or rearrange their loads, and after such a desperate experience, they have taken birth as human beings, which is analogous to getting a rest. However, during this period, instead of rearranging their loads, they become attached to the pleasures of hoarding things for this life, to vanity and arrogance, to defending themselves and responding to others’ chal­lenges, and to the pleasures of the afflictions of this life. However, having carried the load of suffering continuously, they will die. When a clear con­sciousness [remembering] up to seven [former] lives arises, they will think, ‘What kind of person am I, bereft of any collection of merit? In my past lives I have taken birth in the three lower realms, Yet, even though numer­ous props came by me, I failed to prepare for the fate of my future lives. So, I am likely to take birth in the three lower realms again.’ A time will come when they will be dragged by visions of suffering and will be at a total loss within the three lower realms.”“Drom, now is the time to rearrange your heavy load.

For example, if a child falls into a fire pit, his mothers heart cannot bear it. Abruptly discarding all seemingly important tasks, her mind is consumed only with the urgent thought of how to free her child. Usually, Drom, though she has great love for her son, if he is in no imme­diate danger, she prioritizes other tasks.“If you possess an unbearable compassion for all sentient beings, Drom, you will drop all [other] tasks and will strive your best to free sentient beings.

Years before, when I was younger, if I had engaged in Dharma practice it would have been possible, but this did not happen. So you young ones, please undertake [Dharma practice].’ Saying such things in hoarse voices, they will need to use all fours just to stand up. At that time their children and grandchildren, the ones in whom they have placed so much hope and"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r 2 0 343expectation, will refer to them with such endearing names as, [20z] wretched old man, annoying old crank.’ Cursing, they might even say, 'It seems it is never this old man’s turn to die. Everyone would be better off if he were dead.’Master, can such people obtain happiness? If Dharma practice is found in them, a horn has grown on a rabbit’s head! There are no stronger means to forsake Dharma practice than these three excuses.“Master, pray ensure that we do not fall victim to such a fate. When one is young one is vigorous, so it is the time for the young monk to practice Dharma. In the prime of one’s life, one can undertake any virtuous activ­ity of the three doors, so that is the time to practice Dharma. If one is old one is worn out; nothing really matters [much] then. Being close to death, one should think of the practices [that can be applied at the] point of death. Thinking, ‘I will need provisions for my future life, which is certain to come,’ seek the three conditions that help one not to set Dharma practice aside. Even if it hastens death, striving in Dharma practice is crucial. One must help lead one’s parents. Thinking, ‘I lack the capacity to help lead these unruly parents of mine; I may not be able to do so. I will therefore seek protection, refuge, and support from the Three Jewels.’ Since one needs a kind master to protect one from dangers, one should entrust all three— one’s mind, heart, and breast35*— to the Three Jewels and suppli­cate them, saying, ‘Pray protect me and my parents from the sufferings of cyclic existence and the lower realms. Bless me so that I will be fully and manifesdy awakened for the sake of my parents.’ Go for refuge in this man­ner. Contemplate the benefits of nirvana, which is the sole antidote against the sufferings of samsara, the object to be relinquished.“Master, there are two things that I know: the objects to be abandoned must be abandoned and the objects to be adopted must be adopted. One who has accomplished abandonment and adoption is a buddha. Once one has attained buddhahood, one can liberate sentient beings; but without it there is no success. Some may observe a minor aspect of ethical discipline, which is the foundation for obtaining birth in the higher realms. Some are utterly blind; while sufferings of birth, death, and so on fall upon them like rain, they worry, thinking, ‘Now I am going to die.’ Not only will they die, they will [also] be born. They should think, ‘What would I do were I born in the three lower realms?’ But, failing to contemplate impermanence even for a single instant, they look here and there and, at times, laugh at things that are dissatisfying and take joy in them. At other times, having to"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"344 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mexperience even a single suffering or dissatisfaction, they cry out in sorrow and shout lamentations. They don’t cry for major [sufferings] but do so for minor ones. They do not cry at the fact that all their parents are suffering but do so if a single [being] is dying. Even in terms of this single being, they don’t cry at the fact that the being undergoes constant birth and death; rather, they cry when the being dies once. [203] Failing to see the past and future, they see only the occasional sufferings. Without seeing the long­term consequences, they only see the immediate as the source of problems.“This [situation] is [like] the so-called ‘tale of the bad dog’: Once an owner of a dog [needed to hide]. There was an imminent danger from his enemy such that if his dog were to bark, the enemy would discover and harm [the owner]. So he tried to tie the dog with a leash and hide it inside. However, [the dog acted] as if he were being slaughtered and would not obey at all. He wailed while inside [the house] and, unable to bear it any­more, ran outside and began barking. The enemy killed the dog and then [killed] the owner along with him.“Likewise, as for those who are occupied only with the mundane con­cerns of this life and have nothing to show for their future lives— whether recitating a single line of going for refuge, acquiring a [mere] earful of learning, undertaking a recitation or two, paying respectful homage to a special object of refuge once, circumambulating once, rejoicing once in others’ spiritual practice, or at the very least doing something beneficial in this life, such as offering a plateful of doughballs once—without any of this, if someone carries the title of a practitioner and is recognized by oth­ers as a Dharma practitioner, he should be labeled a charlatan. If he is clever with words he will talk; if he is greatly learned in some areas, he won’t be even able to support his weight [for he will be full of himself]. Listen instead to the diligent and the disciplined. Listen, [for adding] exposition upon an exposition does not help. A good monk doesn’t need a container in which to pour his infractions. He who refrains from what is inappro­priate is known to have entered the ranks of the realized.555“Master, it is beyond question that such an approach is successful on the path. To express it succinctly, a Dharma practitioner needs to be like this: he should be someone who says, ‘Relying on teachers in whom all three qualities— learning, discipline, and kindness—are complete, I have settled all doubts pertaining to the treatises and instructions. There is nothing left for me to do but to practice Dharma. If things go well, it is [on account of] the Three Jewels. If things do not go well, it is [also the blessings of]"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"T h e J e w e l G a r la n d o f D ia lo g u e s, C h a p t e r 2 0 345the Three Jewels. My share of correct abiding in terms of study, critical reflection, and meditative practice has not been insufficient. If I do not die [soon], I will continue to gather the two accumulations, step by step. If, on the other hand, I were to die today, I would have no regrets.’ Someone like this is needed.\"The actual counterforce should be as straight as the string of a power­ful bow; the preparation should be as intense as the heat of a sandalwood fire. He who receives teachings should be flexible like the leather of a musk deer’s hide that can be stretched from anywhere. If such an individual hap­pens to be clad in a saffron robe, this is most excellent. Otherwise, so long as he has tamed his mind, there is no fault in whatever way of life he chooses. However, once he has joined the monastic order, [204] he should be such that not even a hundred charming demonesses would be able to seduce him; not even a hundred demons of the dark force should be able to detract him away from the Dharma. It is inappropriate to disparage any­one who is such a spiritual practitioner. There are many ways to pursue [the Dharma]; if one’s outlook is not in error, this is sufficient.”After [Drom] had spoken, Master Atisa replied: “Drom, if you know these things, what need is there to ask me? Anyway, there are no short­comings in what [you have said].”“Master, what benefit is there in knowing it for oneself [alone]? There is no fault in repeating things that pertain to others’ welfare. I asked you [about these] because you are my teacher. There is the benefit of prevent­ing self-satisfaction more easily later on. There is the benefit of convincing others [as well].”“Drom, there is no flaw in your [presentation]. I shall give you some­thing whereby all the teachings are succinctly condensed.”“Master, I would like to receive this. Such is needed for Dharma prac­tice. If, [the teachings are] too numerous, one cannot put them into prac­tice. If there are too many excellent teachings, making the choice becomes impractical.”“Drom, sustain the following in your mind:“Let go of self, embrace others, and reside in a canopy of light;Undo the basis of appearance and contingence, devoid of essence;Not finding them when sought is a success on the path;That is the irreversible path.”"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"346 T h e B o o k o fK a d a m“Master, this is a profound teaching.”“Drom, integrate [these teachings] within the immeasurable mode of being;Eliminate from their roots the sufferings of samsara;This is the irreversible [path].Cultivate this as long as space remains.“Drom, though there are numerous traditions, uphold your own;Do not cling to a tradition but train in others as well;Forsake exaggeration and denigration of other traditions;Train in all and integrate them into one.“Drom, if the soil is fertile, whatever one sows will grow;For the kindhearted all wishes will come true;For those who persevere, there are no obstacles;Those wise in ethical norms journey to liberation.“Drom, this is it:Lead the beings by means of appearance;Restfully sleep in the ultimate expanse of wisdom.”“Master, well said, most learned pandita!If wrapped up in its entirety, that is it indeed.Though your responses to my queries were many,If I summarize them, it is this:Never defame the teachings.Whatever practices you admire,With aspiration and the ten spiritual deeds,Strive diligendy, delineating day and night.“There is nothing other than this.”This concludes the twentieth chapter of the Jew el Garland o f Dialogues, “Practicing the Profound Teaching without Defaming Other Teachings.”"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Chapter 21Dedication and Purifying Negative Karma[205] On another occasion, ac that very same place and in the presence of the teacher, our teacher [Dromtönpa], the perfect spiritual friend, made the following plea:“O teacher Atisa,My spiritual guide who reveals the perfect path,You who are enriched by the three vows,Ordained vajra-holder,Here in this holy site of Taras buddhafield,Indistinguishable from the forest of khadira trees,356 Like a father at home with his son,You have leisurely engaged in a jewel garland of dialogues,Using common terms that are easy to understand So that it will be suitable for dull-witted beings.“I have experienced all your higher qualities.You have conferred upon my mind profound secret empowerments, Such as the heart drops [of the Kadam tradition];You have blessed me as a vajra-holder.Within the primordially empty sphere,You have conferred upon my mind the profound empowerment,The sutra teachings on exchanging self and others.“The lotus grove, sun, and moon of the discipline [basket]Of those who are learned in ethical norms,These arise as the supreme foundation for all higher qualities.I have striven in the six perfections day and night,Integrating them into study, reflection, and meditation.Now, it is appropriate to dedicate,Toward the final supreme enlightenment,The virtues of my three doors,Those in which I have endeavored throughout all three times."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"348 T h e B o o k o fK a d a m“Do not waver, my one god with a smiling countenance.Though there are countless different languages,You teach using each of them, without confusion.You illuminate, in terms of the coarse and minute aspects of infraction, The subtle aspects of the cause and effect Of immaculate, pure ethical discipline.You are my teacher indeed.“Through your immeasurable powerYou do not abandon beings even for an instant;You engage in the Dharma both day and night.You are my teacher indeed.“By uniting all things in appearance and emptiness,You are most skilled in differentiating generalities and particulars Without confusing them.You are my teacher indeed.“Though your three doors remain immersed in the ultimate expanse, You reveal everything as bodies of divinities;You illuminate the generation and completion stages within.You are my teacher indeed.“Though you see the ultimate mode of being as it is,You do not defy the law of karma and its fruits;You invest your three doors in virtue.You, the savior, are a teacher indeed.“Though you have eliminated all misdeeds,You display [yourself] as a monk dedicated to his vows;

In order not to breach the words of the teachers, he taught again, in a sharp and concise form, about death and impermanence, the defects of cyclic existence, and karma and its effects, just as found in The Book. Those who had gathered in the assembly all experienced deep revulsion toward cyclic existence. So, for us, too, it is critical to reflect from death and imper­manence [onward]. As Atisa states:Constantly reminding yourself of impermanence,592 Exhort yourself to be free from this mire.Body and mind are like the clouds in the sky—They gather instantly, yet are gone just as quickly.Pull up the strings of your conscienceless heart.

Once, having reflected in this manner, you generate forceful awareness that you will inevitably die, you will die soon, and there is no certainty as to when you will die, you then examine where you might be reborn after death.

Consecrating the trainee’s environmentThe first, in turn, has two parts, the first of which is the master’s exhorta­tion to his own mental continuum. For this, the master should cultivate the five recollections and place the three letters upon the three points of his body. Then, audible to the students, he should recite one, two, or three times, and with full conviction, “The Tree of Devotion” composed by Dromtönpa in the past. The text of this [self-exhortation] is located in a separate [chapter].413Second, the actual preliminary, which must be performed collectively by the master and students, is as follows: for this [rite], arrange whatever offer­ings you have gathered in front of the Three Jewels. Everyone, both master and students, should then undertake a succinct or elaborate version of the seven-limbs rite. Then, in unison, recite the lines composed by Dromtönpa three times. The text of this [rite] also is located in a separate [chapter].4142. The procedure for creating a mandala TO SUSTAIN the traineesWhen [beginning] the mandala construction, send those who have not received oral transmissions elsewhere. Then, in a room free of unsuitable vessels, you should, while reciting the om mani padm e hüm mantra, paint [the room as follows]: make the ceiling white in the aspect of om ; as for walls, make the east yellow in the aspect of ma, the south white in the aspect of ni, the west blue in the aspect of pad, the north green in the aspect of me, and the ground white in the aspect of hüm. The syllables can be merely represented [by being imagined]. Hang a parasol and arrange the three representations,413 especially those of the four divinities of Kadam. Then fully ordained monks numbering sixteen, eight, twelve, six, four, or two should wear their ceremonial yellow robes and make prostrations to the representations, [saying]:Fully awakened buddhas and bodhisattvas,O compassionate ones, to help purify evil karma,Pray confer upon meThe sublime rite of rectification."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f th e H e a r t -D r o p P r a c tic e 419Make this supplication three times and recite:Just as the children of the conquerors did,I, too, shall accomplish [others’ welfare].Reciting this three times, perform the rite of rectification [of broken pre­cepts]. [249] Then, having generated yourself as Buddha Sakyamuni, mark the three points of your body with the three letters. Place a clean container filled with pure and scented water in front of you and [visualize that] light radiates from the three letters and dissolves into the water, blessing the water [and transforming it] into the ambrosia of uncontaminated wisdom. Next carry a portion of the water to places in each of the four directions and, as you sprinkle the water, imagine that you are offering ablutions to the earth and water spirits who reside there. Then declare \"As I wish to bor­row earth and water from this place for the purpose of a spiritual endeavor, with your kind hearts please offer these to me joyfully and embrace this opportunity for [gathering] virtue.”After imagining that they respond, “Please take them with joy,” take complete samples of the varieties of earth and water. If you cannot take samples from all directions, you can do so from a single place but from all its directions. When you have returned to your meditation chamber, place these samples in the correct directions without error. Then, making pros­trations to all [higher beings], including your teachers and the three repre­sentations residing there, recite the following:Teachers and sangha members, pray listen to me. As for this great earth that supports everything, those from whom I have taken it are pleased. I have blessed all of them so that they will be endowed with good fortune. As for this water that gathers everything, those from whom I have taken it are pleased. I have ensured that it is free of pollution. Now there are no obstacles and adverse conditions anywhere. So, teachers and sangha members, please construct the celestial mansion.If only one person brought [the earth and water], one recitation is ade­quate. If there are four [for example], each should recite this individually, one after the other. Then, at that very moment, all present should chant the following in unison:"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"420 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mLike a golden mountain, you are endowed with all perfect factors;416You are the lord of the three worlds who has relinquished all three pollutants;You are the Awakened One, whose eyes resemble a fully blossomed lotus—This is the first auspiciousness that brings goodness to the world.That which has been revealed by him, supreme, excellent, and immutable;That which is hailed in the three worlds and venerated by the gods and humans;The sublime among teachings that creates peace for all beings—This is the second auspiciousness that brings goodness to the world.The sublime Sangha is rich in the auspiciousness of spiritual learning;They are the objects of giving for gods, humans, and demigods; [250]Most excellent assembly, a bastion of self-respect and glory—This is the third auspicious that brings goodness to the world.Recite these lines up to three times.After that, arrange torma cakes and offerings for the four guardian kings in the four cardinal directions 2nd a torma for the interfering forces as well. Offer these in their correct order and assign to them their tasks. Then, once you have engaged in the proclamations and cleansing, expel the interfering forces as you send the torma for the interfering forces away.417Next, everyone should visualize him or herself as Buddha Sàkyamuni and recite the three syllables [om ah hüm ] and the m ani mantra. Then take the good part of the earth samples that were brought, mix it with water, including the water that was consecrated earlier, to make clay. Then, [work­ing] from all four directions, make a platform. If there is an old platform, then paste it from all four sides.

Within his heart generate Avalokites'vara of your own abode, and imagine that it is within his heart that you are constructing the mandala. Then draw the lines in this manner:Leaving space for the rainbows and lotus,Draw the Brahma line [first].Divide this into four and mark these points;Also mark a string that is equal to the length of two [parts].To help find the tip of the Brahma line,Add one fourth [of the line] each [to this thread],And placing the pivot half way to the east and west,Make bird prints to the south and north.In this way draw the second Brahma line.Then with a length [of string] that is half of the Brahma line,Hold the pivot at the tip of the Brahma line,And mark the four corners with bird prints.In this way draw the diagonal and horizontal lines.Then, over the three main lines,419 Draw four long lines and six shorter lines.Again, just as with the earlier longer lines,Excluding the middle part of the lines,On the outside and inside link their two ends.Of the two central lines, divide the inner into two halves And the outer into four parts;Again, just as with the earlier shorter lines,Divide the first in half, the other halfInto another half, and the second into four parts,Thus [together] drawing ten shorter lines.

As for the four petals: the east is yellow, the south is white, the west is dark blue, and the north is green. All those that are to be colored according to their directions should be done in this sequence as well. Place the goddesses in the grids and the four directional guardians at the four doors. On the corners and on the sides, draw numerous white reliquary stupas. On the outer perime­ter draw a lotus with one thousand petals or however many petals you can fit. Surround this on the outside with the five colors of the rainbow. As for a [pearl] net of full and half loops, four leveled porticos, the wheel of Dharma, its lotus seat, and a parasol atop the wheel, draw these in accor­dance with the general custom.Next, you should place the ritual articles. If enough vases are available, place six vases: one at the center with one on top of it and one in each of"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f th e H e a r t -D r o p P r a c tic e 423the four cardinal directions. Alternatively, you can arrange five vases—one at the center with one in each of the four cardinal directions. You can rely upon only a single vase at the center as well. All of these vases should be adorned with the five sets of vase substances, saffron, milky water, deco­rating symbols, and a mantra repetition string numbering four or one [cor­responding to the number of vases]. Although some perform the rite with tormas and without using vases, it is taught that it is correct to do so with a vase. Then, according to your means, arrange five tormas for the teach­ers and the four divinities on top of the celestial mansion. Alternatively, arrange one torma for all, without distinction. [252] If this, too, is not fea­sible, rededicate the four tormas of the four directional guardians from the period of expelling the interfering forces and place these in the four direc­tions. On the right, arrange one [torma] for the Dharma protectors in gen­eral, including especially the eight gods of the forces of light, and one for the Tenma protectresses. On the left, arrange one for the beings of the six classes and one for the local spirits. Prepare all of these as retaining tormas enriched with the three dairy products and three sweet substances. Arrange sixteen sets of the five articles of offerings, such as lamps, and place them all around [the mandala]. Arrange [also] in appreciably large numbers [bowls containing] scented water.Then, however many practitioners there are who have previously received the oral transmission, whether it be a group of four fully ordained monks [or other groupings], they should perform the rite of generating the drops [after] going for refuge and generating the awakening mind. Hold­ing the mantra repetition strings, they should engage in the rite of approx­imation. They should repeat [the mantras] of Buddha Säkyamuni in the east, of Avalokitesvara in the south, of Acala in the west, and of Tara in the north. If it is not possible to do this in all [the directions], repeat the mantras of all four divinities in whatever directions are feasible. However many monks there are who know the sutras and [the methods for] chant­ing should sing the rites for blessing the ground, the invocation, the praise hymns, the presentation of offerings, and so on.These are the preliminary rituals pertaining to sustaining the neophytes, a detailed presentation of which is now complete.B. The main practice, the presentation of sixteen drops Next, carrying scented water, a fully ordained monk wearing the yellow cer­emonial robe should ask young boys and girls—sixteen, eight, twelve, six,"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"424 The Book of Kadamfour, or two in number— to wash [their faces and hands].421 All the boys and girls don attire with the colors of the five buddha families or the colors of the four divinities. Alternatively, have the boys wear white attire and the girls wear green. Teach all the boys and girls how to make the various offer­ings, such as incense and so on, with all the offering articles facing toward the inside. As all of them see the mandala, ask them to make prostrations and circumambulations, which they perform as they enter [the room]. They should then prostrate three times to the master and, [253] repeating after the master, make the following supplication, reciting three times:All buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in the ten directions, pray attend to me. Master, pray attend to me. As I, known by the name..., seek to relinquish this cyclic existence fraught with defects and seek to attain the higher qualities of liberation, O master, reveal to me the path to this [goal].To this the master should reply:You, who are known by the name..., do you desire to hear about the uncommon path that helps you cross the mire of cyclic existence?After the master has asked this once, the students should then reply, recit­ing once:Yes, I seek this exactly as asked. So master, you who are endowed with a compassionate heart, for the sake of your compassionate heart, allow your heart to be compassionate toward me.Then the master should respond:In the past the Buddha gave countless teachings, and thus there have come to be numerous spiritual traditions. We follow the great Atiáa, the buddha body of emanation. Atis'a possessed all the teachings of the lineages of the three teachers.422 Although Khu, Ngok, and Drom are renowned as his three principal stu­dents, we follow in the footsteps of Drom, who is endowed with all the higher qualities of Atis'a. With respect to [Drom’s teach-"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f th e H e a r t -D r o p P ra c tic e 425ings], as well, there were three lineages that upheld his teach­ings; of these, ours is the inspirational lineage of practice. Start­ing with the teacher and his son, this [teaching] has been transmitted from ear to ear and from heart to heart through many great Kadam masters.Dipamkara and Avalokitesvara;Supreme wisdom possessor*” and Sherap Gyal;Shönu Gyaltsen and Naljorpa;Rinchen Gyaltsen and his son;Dharma Gyaltsen and his son; jangchup Sangpo, hailed as supreme—[All] are hailed as extraordinary and supreme.Thus, just as stated by Master Namkha Rinchen [in the homage above], this [instruction] has been transmitted through successive lineage holders in such a manner up to this day and is available for practice. Therefore, it is crucial to practice it.Various procedures for the preliminary rites have already been presented above. In this context, again, with a deep wariness of the defects of cyclic existence and with admiration for the path to nirvana, you should, in accordance with the general procedure, undertake extensively [the practice of] taking refuge and generating the awakening mind. Alternatively, since the methods for training the mind have already been explained in detail earlier, [254] without entering into a long discourse here, [suffice it to say that] you could rely on an existing formula for going for refuge and gen­erating the mind [such as the following]:All buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in the ten directions, pray attend to me. Master, pray attend to me. All the buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in the ten directions and my master, please help me so that I, known by the name..., can go for refuge to the Three Jewels.Make this supplication three times.Again, using the same invocation and specification of timeframe as before, take the common refuge three times by reciting the following before each of the Three Jewels:"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"426 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mI, known by the name.. from this moment until the end of my life, go for refuge to the blessed buddhas, supreme among the biped humans. I go for refuge to the Dharma, tranquil and supreme among those that are free of attachment. I go for refuge to the noble Sangha, supreme among communities.Next, make supplications to generate the awakening mind, reciting the fol­lowing three times:All buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in the ten directions, pray attend to me. Master, pray attend to me. Just as the per­fectly awakened buddhas of the past— those tathägatas who have destroyed the foe—and the great bodhisattvas who abide in the great levels first generated the mind for perfect and full awakening, O master, help me so that I, known by the name..., will also generate the mind for perfect and full awakening.Next, as for performing [the rite of] special refuge, “From this moment until I reach the essence of enlightenment” indicates the timeframe. [You should also make the following substitution:]I go for refuge to the supreme community, the great Sangha of noble bodhisattvas who are beyond the stage of reversibility.Except for these two changes, the rest is the same as in the rite for the com­mon [refuge practice].Next, in order to generate the awakening mind, say, “Pray attend to me” as before and [recite]:Through whatever roots of virtue that I, known by the name..., have created, encouraged others to do, or have rejoiced in, in this life and in other lives— no matter whether these roots of virtue performed were in the nature of giving, [255] in the nature of morality, or in the nature of meditation— I will, from this moment forth until achieving the essence of enlighten­ment, generate the mind for perfect and full great awakening, just as the perfectly enlightened buddhas of the past— those tathägatas who have destroyed their foes— and the great bodhi-"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f th e H e a r t -D r o p P r a c tic e 427sattvas who abide in the great levels first generated the mind for perfect and full awakening. I will liberate the sentient beings who are not yet liberated; I will release those who have not yet achieved release; I will grant relief to those who are unrelieved; and I will help those who have not yet attained total nirvana attain total nirvana.In this way, generate the awakening mind three times.Then, following your master’s exposition of the sixteen drops, students should engage in their meditation. Train in them at a leisurely pace and ascer­tain them in your mind. When you arrive at the point of die mantra repeti­tion, then perform the approximation rite in a thunderous voice. For those with the highest faculties, all sixteen drops are taught in one day; whereas, for those who are below the level of middling faculty, the sixteen drops are taught in a sequential order wherein one entire drop is taught per day.i. The drop of the outer inconceivable array First, while reciting om svabhävasuddhä sarvadharmäh svabhävasuddho ’ham, imagine that the entire world, including the environment and the beings therein, dissolves into emptiness. From within this sphere visualize your own mind [arising] as a white drop, which is bright and free of con­ceptuality, like a crystal egg or a mass of vivid light. If created it can gen­erate all forms of emanations; if released it dissolves into the natural expanse. As this [light] extends horizontally and vertically, imagine your­self as an enjoyment body Great Compassion who is, in his nature, indi­visible from Buddha Sâkyamuni. From within this sphere, a white lotus, a lotus pervading wherever space extends, appears in front of you. Upon this generate a white ah, [from which] a moon disc of similar size appears. Upon this [moon disc] is a white hrih. From this generate Avalokitesvara, who has one thousand arms, one thousand eyes, and eleven heads. [256] His principal hand implements are the same as those within the general [depiction of the deity]. Hís body pervades wherever space extends. From the three letters at the three points of his body emanate light rays that bring about the welfare of sentient beings. All aspects of the mandala of his body, such as his pores, are filled with inconceivable buddhafields whose limits cannot be fathomed by anyone. Generate a limidess body, such as described in the Jew el Casket Sutra.m This is also known also as “the drop of the natural ultimate mode of being.”"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"As you venerate this body by means of looking at it with devotion and reyerence, he becomes utterly pleased. Imagine that you and all sentient beings, with no one left behind, enter through the wisdom door that has been spontaneously opened at his heart. Imagine this body to be the celes­tial mansion.This is the first drop, the drop o f the outer inconceivable array.2. The drop of this Endurance WorldInside his heart, a white lotus appears from a white pam , and a moon disc cushion appears from a white ah. These two form the seat for all those who appear subsequently as well. Upon this [seat], the emanation body Bud­dha Sakyamuni appears from a yellow om, flanked by two attendants. He propounds the teaching of the four truths and, by sending emanations to many places, brings about their welfare. Numerous buddhas, bodhi- sattvas, noble disciples, and self-enlightened ones entirely fill the space around this palace. As light radiates from the three letters at the three points of their bodies, it touches the three points of the bodies of all beings of the six realms— including yourself—who are gathered there purifying the w o obscurations as well as their propensities. All the bodies become unobscured and transparent like a crystal ball. In this place where rainbow tents abound in all directions, generate all other beings into Great Com­passion with one face and two arms, holding a precious jewel rosary in their right hands and a lotus flower in their left. Light radiates from the three letters at the three points of each body, and from the tips [of these light rays] emerge uninterrupted masses of offering clouds for [the bud­dhas], including Buddha Sakyamuni, in particular. Then perform the seven limbs:I prostrate to this pristinely pure body/25Free of the duality of homage and an object of homage. [257]To the gods I offer the collections of pure offerings,Unsoiled by arising, abiding, and ceasing. II confess and rectify the ill deeds [casting me off] a deep abyss [Performed by] my three doors, devoid of arising, abiding, and ceasing;As for those who, though empty, display diverse forms,I rejoice with admiration in these countless saviors.428 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f the H e a r t -D r o p P ra c tic e429Pray turn the wheel in the ultimate expanse Of the emptiness of wishes and signs.0 dharmakäya, devoid of birth,Being the nature of spontaneous abiding,Pray do not depart.1 dedicate this so that through this virtueAll those of cyclic existence will realize this truth And be led into such a celestial mansion.May they experience this secret mantra.I dedicate this so that they will immediatelyHail the supreme generation and completion [stages]Of outer, inner, secret, and suchness,Upon a seat of a refined moonOn the hub of a thousand-petaled lotus,Just like the five deities of the action [tantra class].This adventitious [world] does not exist Separate from the ultimate expanse.May the perfect auspiciousnessOf this perfect absence of separateness prevail.May the auspiciousness of pristine lineage prevail!Through purity in the beginning, middle, and end,May the auspiciousness of unwavering prevail!With these words composed by the spiritual guide [Dromtönpa], cultivate a deep sense of conviction. Furthermore, once you have made supplica­tions for the fulfillment of your wishes, until you become weary, place your mind in single-pointed [awareness] and settle upon the deities that are clear and devoid of intrinsic existence. Atis'a states:It has been stated in the scriptures:426 On a perfectly flawless mirror The reflection of a form appears Having no intrinsic reality.Understand all phenomena in the same manner."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"430 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mSimilarly, as I, too, share the same nature,My teachings are also within this nature—They too are false appearances.As stated here, undertake the meditation.When you become weary from this [meditation], rise by means of the five recollections. [Imagine] that all sentient beings, led by yourself, cir­cumambulate the principal deity and recite om mani padm e hüm aloud in unison. Imagine that the obscurations are purified by the emission and withdrawal of lights. This is important. Even if you recite the m ani mantra during all the drops, there is no contradiction. Given that it is this Endurance [World that is being cultivated], generating Buddha Säkya- muni is said to be excellent here. It is taught that there is also no contra­diction in generating Avalokitesvara with one thousand arms or with forty primary arms as the principal deity and reciting the m ani mantra. [2.58] Thus, having approximated [the principal deity] and circumambulated him, [imagine that] the principal deity is pleased. He opens the door of his heart, from which he emits a light ray that draws in all the retinue deities as well as all beings of the six realms, including you. As the outer ones dis­solve into the hearts of the inner ones, the outer ones transform into a celes­tial mansion of light, which, in its nature, is the deities themselves, and which appears with colors similar to the [corresponding] deities. The upper part is om, the east ma, the south ni, the west pad, the north me, and the lower part hüm. It is square, has four doors, and is adorned with four por­ticos. [It is transparent so that] from the outside the inside is clearly visible, and from the inside the outside is clearly visible. Stabilize this visualization.Whereas a detailed description has been given here, in the subsequent [drops] the generation stage, with its seed syllable, principal deity and his retinues, and mantra, is different. However, in all other aspects of the rite, from [the generation of] the lotus and moon seats up to the dissolution into the heart, there is no variation from the rite described here.This is the second drop, the drop o f this Endurance World in particular.3. The drop of the realm of TibetInside his heart imagine our mountainous sphere. From a white hrth gener­ate Avalokitesvara either with forty primary arms or with four arms.

In the past, the spiritual guide Rinchen Sal asked the Dharma king Drom himself for a method of visualizing him that is not found elsewhere. Drom suggested that he make offerings to Avalokitesvara and advised, \"Do not visualize him as Drom. I am [actually] like this.” Say­ing this, he transformed [himself] into a hrih on a lotus and moon disc, from which he appeared as a white youth in standing position. He had a smiling expression, and his body was slightly bent. His complexion was like polished crystal. His black hair was unbound and draped over his two shoulders. In his right hand he was counting the beads of a precious rosary of jewels, while in his left hand he held a white staff made of crystal. At the tip of this staff was a white lotus with one thousand open petals; upon its yellow stamen was a moon-disc cushion on which sat the Great Mother, holding her usual hand implements. On her right sat the teacher Dlpamkara, [259] while on her left sat Buddha Säkyamuni; though identical in nature they manifested distinct appearances. One thousand buddhas and also the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions sat upon the petals. From the three letters at the three points of their bodies, light radiated and dissolved into the spir­itual guide Rinchen Sal. Exclaiming, “You, O man of treatises, have made the precious teaching of the Buddha extremely radiant,” Dromtönpa con­ferred an empowerment upon him, making a great spectacle.At that instant it occurred to the spiritual guide Rinchen Sal that: “Due to the kindness of my father Dromtönpa, I have received the empower­ment of the Three Jewels. I am the principal son of the conqueror and his son. In the future, when father is no more, from whom can I receive such empowerments?” As these thoughts occurred to him, the spiritual guide [Dromtönpa] said: “Rinchen Sal, actual experience is better than [relying on] a future text. Nonetheless, until the root [of this teaching] is exhausted, the youthful bodhisattva upholds my victory banner/28 You should rely upon him. There is no difference between him and me. Furthermore, though exposition is important, practice is more important, so emanate light from the three letters at the three points of your body, bless the three doors of your parents, and transform their bodies into bodies exactly resembling my own. He [Phuchungwa] also does the same.”Therefore, in this context you, too, should generate yourself as the prin­cipal deity with all his features and imagine being surrounded by a great ret­inue of buddhas and bodhisattvas. Then recite the essence mani mantra. As for the rest [of the practice of this drop], it is the same as the previous drop.This is the third drop, the drop o f the realm o f Tibet in particular."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"431 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m4. The drop of one’s abode and the drawn mandalaInside his heart, visualize your abode as a standing Avalokitesvara with one face and two arms, as described earlier, who emerges from a hrih. Here, too, recite the mani mantra. The rest [of the practice] is as before.As a sand mandala is to be created within his heart, perform its rite of generation. The mandala is complete with all sixteen doors. If you wish to be elaborate, you can generate Avalokitesvara of the external world, [260] Buddha Säkyamuni of the Endurance [World], Avalokitesvara of the sphere of Tibet, and Avalokitesvara of your own abode as standing at the four outer doors. Generate these [worlds] gradually in sequence, as before, and enter them. Again, beginning with the Great Mother, gradually enter the twelve remaining drops that are explained later. If, on the other hand, it is [a mandala with] a single door and so on, the outer ones reside inside the heart of the Avalokites'vara that has been generated in your abode. Within his heart visualize the drop of the Great Mother and so on, as described later on [in the text], up to the drop of great awakening. Enter­ing [the drops] in this manner is most convenient. As for regular daily prac­tice, you should generate yourself into Avalokitesvara as [portrayed] in your abode, and within his heart visualize the remaining drops, such as that of the Great Mother. The essence mantra is om m ani padm e hüm.This is the fourth drop, the drop o f one’s abode and the drawn mandala.5. The drop of Perfection of Wisdom MotherInside his heart visualize the Great Mother, who is yellow and has one face and four arms. With her first right hand she performs the gesture of grant­ing protection, and with her second [right hand] she holds a vajra. Her first left hand is in the gesture of meditative equipoise, and in her second she holds a scripture. Surrounded by a retinue of the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions, she recites aloud in a thunderous rhythm the sounds of the perfection of wisdom. Visualize this until you gain palpable ascer­tainment of [all phenomena] as being free of conceptual elaborations.Here the essence mantra is tadyathä om gate gate päragate pärasamgate bodhi svähä. Recite this mantra. Read aloud scriptures such as the Perfection ofWisdom as well.

Alternatively, recite mantras of other wrathful goddesses. At this point, if you have other practices pertaining to the cycle of medita­tive practices of wrathful goddesses that you need to undertake, you can do so here.This is the ninth drop, the drop o f her wrathful form . [262]xo. The drop of Acala, th eir im mutable nature Inside her heart visualize a blue Acala with one face and two arms who glares with two bloodshot eyes. In his right hand he holds a sword, and with his left he gestures threateningly while holding a lasso. His right leg is bent, his right leg extended. Wearing a tiger-skin loincloth, he stands amid an army of [dancing] flames and is surrounded by a retinue of numerous wrathful deities.The essence mantra is om canda mahä rosana hüm phat. Thus [recite] the mantra of the ten perfections. [Recite] om canda mahä rosana, pray guard the teaching and sentient beings, guard them!

[Visualize that] there are the same number of Great Compassions to Atis'a’s nght, the same number of Acalas behind him, and the same num­ber of Taras to his left. Alternatively, you can visualize one of each of the four deities. In the southeast is Atis'a in the appearance of a learned pandita; in the southwest is Drom; in the northwest Ngok;425 and in the northeast Khutön.450 Imagine that all the teachers of Atis'a, especially those of the three lineages, fill the entire space above and around them.The essence mantra here is om m uni m uni mahä muniye svähä, or om mani padm e hum; or you can also recite the essence mantra of all four divinities or that of the three buddha families.

His body, which is that of a sixteen-year-old youth, is clear as a crystal in which the Three Jew­els are reflected exactly as they are. In each of his four directions are four youths, each emanated by and resembling [Drom]. Above and around him are Atis'a, Serlingpa, Avadhutipa, and so on— teachers of method and wis­dom, who surround him densely, like thick clouds, all reciting the pro­found words of the Buddha. Coundess buddhas and bodhisattvas who reveal the profound teaching appear from their bodies and then, like clear clouds, disappear and depart into the interstices of a rainbow. All of them are engaged in playful dances that resemble the dances performed by Dakin! Guhyajñána when the conqueror, his son, and numerous dakinis gathered inside the heart mandala. Regarding this, read the story of prince Könchok Bang.451For the essence mantra, recite om m ani padm e hum. Here, too, you enter into the pores of the emanation bodies, principally the spiritual guide [Dromtönpa], wherein you find numerous beautiful celestial mansions. The conqueror and his son reside chere, too, revealing [Drom’s] profound past-life stories. View the extraordinary places as Radreng, where extraordi­nary people who follow the conqueror and his son emanate inconceivable manifestations and are immersed in inconceivable meditative absorptions."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"436 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mListen insatiably to the profound teachings and, exiting [from the pores], once again gaze at the principal deity’s face and so on.This is the twelfth drop, the drop o f his son, Gyalwai fungné.13. The drop of the vast practice [lineage]Inside his heart visualize the conqueror Maitreya, either in his regal form from when he was enthroned as the successor to Buddha ààkyamuni or in the appearance of a fully ordained monk, without the yellow ceremonial robe but bearing the exemplary and noble marks. Everyone who walks in his presence [264] acquires the capacity to enter freely into the meditative absorption on loving-kindness. On his right is the great bodhisattva monk, the elder Gaganämäla, while on his left is the great bodhisattva monk Ava- lokiteivara. Boch of them are standing in a slightly leaning pose. Every­where, above and around them, all of the teachers, from noble AsaAga to Serlingpa, are present in the form of great bodhisattva monks. They recite the profound scriptures of the perfection of wisdom, and, while remaining unwavering in meditative equipoise realizing their meaning, perform the task of leading the spiritual trainees to the unmistaken levels and paths. Thus they engage spontaneously in the three wheels— the wheel of read­ing by means of study and reflection, the wheel of meditative practice by means of concentration, and the wheel of action by means of the activities. Imagine that they emanate numerous manifestations to the celestial god realms and so on.The essence mantra is either m aitri or päragatefn it is taught that one can also recite ah [alone].

As a pair of two principal disciples in the form of ordained monks, Atis'a is on his right and Avalokitesvara is on his left.

All of these [masters] manifest diverse emanations and then disappear once again into the expanse of nonconceptuality. They reveal the teaching without language. Even when they do so through language, [they proclaim]:Free of reification and denigration of “is,” “is not,” eternalism, and nihilism;Free of going and coming, hopes and fears, and object and subject;Free of self and others, good and bad, and attachment and aversion—This expanse of drop beyond speech and words,This meditation upon the absence of letters,Is the meditative absorption of the tathägatas.433Imagine that the sound of these lines also echoes resoundingly from the environment, the skies, rainbows, lights, [265] lotuses, moon discs, and so on. As these sounds arise, the emanation bodies also depart by disappear­ing into the ultimate expanse. They reappear in the form of yellow drops, from which they display themselves vividly in the form of their respective bodies. Some manifest as enjoyment bodies and engage in the dance of wis­dom. Visualize this.For the essence mantra, you could either recite ah or om marti padm e hüm. If you have any other meditative practice on the meaning of the pro­found absence of all extremes, undertake its practice here. As you engage in the meditation and mantra recitation practice in this manner, imagine that Lord Nâgârjunà is pleased. He then exclaims, “Child of the family, as you have completed most of the dual accumulations, do you wish to see the buddhafield in the Akanistha realm?” Saying this, he opens the door of his heart and draws you into his heart by means of a lightbeam. This is the same as before [in the case of the previous drops].This is the fourteenth drop, the drop o f the profound view.15.

Holding a vajra and bell in his two hands, his body is in a slightly leaning pose with his two legs crossed. He is adorned with various orna­ments, such as a crown. At his sides is a pair of principal disciples as [described] earlier, both of whom are in the form of an enjoyment body, supreme heroes holding a vajra and bell in their hands. Visualize all the teachers of the inspiration [lineage], such as Tilopa, Nâropa, Dombhïpa, and so on, above and around them; visualize in particular the lineage mas­ters of the Jew el Garland. [Visualize] also [that all of space] is filled with the vajra-holders, all of whom recite secret tantras and the profound retention mantras. Creating inconceivable mandalas within a single instant, they, in actuality, confer the four empowerments upon all beings, self and others. In brief, in accord with your mental capacity, conjure immeasurable offer­ings of meditative absorption; imagine that you please [the higher beings] through your offerings. Recite all appropriate secret tantra and profound retention mantras. Here, meditate also on all [deities] belonging to the enjoyment body class that you would like to practice, [266] and repeat their mantras. Now transform yourself into the nature of a deity and resolve decisively, “Having ceased all ordinary concepts, I will never deviate from the bounds of uncontaminated bliss.”This is the fifteenth drop, the drop o f the inspirational practice.16. The drop of great awakeningAgain, imagine that, inside his heart, there is an extremely vast celestial mansion, higher than the previous ones, situated upon the lotus and moon seat similar to those [described] earlier. Its form is difficult to comprehend, even by the bodhisattvas on the ten levels. Imagine that all [aspects] of this utterly attractive and beautiful mansion are the inconceivable natures of the Buddhas untangled qualities— the ten faculties, the ten powers, and the four fearlessnesses. As for its nature, its reality is indivisible from the dharmakäya.At its center, imagine yourself as the dharmakäya buddha endowed with uncontaminated wisdom. In appearance you are an enjoyment body, yel­low and seated cross-legged in the posture of meditative equipoise. Immersed in meditative equipoise, not wavering from all enlightened attributes, abide in the great exertion-free sphere of the spontaneous accomplishment of all [aims]. Imagine that, from within this sphere, you manifest numerous emanation bodies and reside in this manner within the celestial mansion."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f th e H e a r t -D r o p P ra c tic e 439Then, inside the center of the heart of yourself as the principal deity, visualize a yellow drop about the size of a large mustard seed that is clear and bright as light. As it increases in size, visualize a precious jeweled con­tainer that is expansive and extremely high, utterly clear and radiant. Inside this, imagine your own mind, clear and radiant, in the form of a yellow drop the size of a pea. As this light, which flutters about as if [trying to] catch [something], increases in size, it becomes an ocean of drops with the color of refined gold and absolutely smooth. Its base is so stable that it could last until the end of space. It is vast and pervasive like space. It is so pervasive that it permeates every ordinary being and every noble one. Like the surface of a clean mirror, it reflects all forms. Visualize this. [267]Place your mind in equipoise on this for a long time, and from within that sphere, visualize that the deities of the celestial mansion of the sixteen outer drops transform into drops of their individual colors. Sequentially they dis­solve one into another, with the latter ones dissolving into the former ones. Finally, all the drops up to Vajradhara fuse into a single drop that is free of conceptual elaborations and that becomes the size of a pea. This dissolves into the om of your crown, the om dissolves into the ah of your throat, and the ah dissolves into the hum of your heart. This in turn dissolves into the drop of [great] awakening. Then, within the sphere of the drop of indivisi­ble emptiness and compassion, which is luminous and devoid of conceptu­ality, abide in meditative equipoise until you become weary.When you are weary from [performing] this [meditation], once again, as you have done previously, generate a container from yellow awakening drops the size of mustard seeds and its ocean-like contents from yellow awakening drops the size of peas. From within this indivisibility of empti­ness and compassion emerges a white drop that transforms into Aval- okites'vara. He is on the ocean of awakening drops—which resemble the surface of a mandala base made of polished, refined gold—like an orna­ment placed upon it. Visualize both the ornamented and the ornament as transparent in that each is reflected in the other. Likewise, visualize from one yellow drop Buddha Säkyamuni of the array of this Endurance World. You should also visualize other drops with colors corresponding to the indi­vidual deities from which the individual deities who reside [on this ocean] as [described] before appear. Furthermore, all the Three Jewels of the realms in the ten directions also transform into drops of colors correspon­ding to their individual colors. These are drawn into you through your crown, transform into their respective bodies, and reside on the ocean that"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"440 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mis within you. Likewise, all sentient beings are blessed into white drops of enlightened activity; they are drawn into you, whereby they transform into Avalo kitesvaras and reside on the ocean of drops. Although all of them appear in the form of deities, they came into being from, are based upon, and are in the nature of the drop of the indivisible nature of bliss and clar­ity, which is the single taste of emptiness and compassion. Place your mind in the meditative equipoise [upon this scene] for as long as it lasts.Again, these deities transform into drops of their respective colors and [268] merge indivisibly with the drop of awakening. Remain in equipoise on this, free of conceptual elaboration. When you become weary from [performing] this [meditation], too, visualize, as before, that they arise as drops of their individual colors from this basic drop. Visualize them as deities and place your mind on [the recognition] that they are apparent yet empty like rainbows. You should meditate in this manner alternating [between equipoise and subsequent practices]. For such an ocean of awak­ening drop, there is no occasion for requesting their departure; the drops of emanations and the enlightened activities are such that they share the nature of being emitted and withdrawn. However far one might go [in ones visualization], one never deviates from that [final] point.434This concludes [the presentation o f] the actual sixteen drops.Alternatively, when you desire to undertake the practice of all sixteen drops in an integrated manner, as explained earlier, [meditate in the following manner]: from within the sphere of emptiness, upon a lotus and moon that you have generated, visualize your own mind as a white drop that trans­forms into an Avalokitesvara of the external arrayed [world]. At his heart, on a moon and lotus cushion, visualize yourself in a meditative posture and seated cross-legged; in reality, you are the dharmakäya, and in appearance you have an enjoyment body. For generating the drops of the environment and the deities within it, do these as in the manner of the preceding [drops]. When visualizing the deities, you should also engage in such activ­ities as making prostrations, offerings, and circumambulations, and recit­ing the essence mantras. As for the abodes of the deities, you can visualize these in the fashion of one temple complex with numerous smaller cham­bers with doors facing inward. Most importantly, you should place your mind in equipoise within the sphere of the indivisibility of emptiness and compassion."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"E lu c id a t io n o f th e H e a r t -D r o p P r a c tic e 441If you wish to elaborate on this, you can visualize all the sixteen drops in colors corresponding to that of the deities, which, starting from the inte­rior, emanate outward, as described before. Even if you wish to draw them in, as explained before, you should do so in a sequential order from the out­side, with the outer dissolving into the inner. Undertake these two medi­tations [of emanating out and drawing in] alternately.In this context when all the sixteen drops are being integrated into one, if you wish to practice guru yoga, visualize at your crown or at the center of your heart the teachers who are endowed with the three lineages or, par­ticularly, the lineage teachers of the Jew el Garland. On the ocean of drops, visualize your root teacher. Above him, all the teachers are seated in sequence. Pay homage to them and make offerings. The earlier teachers dis­solve into the later ones, [269] and finally even your own root teacher [dis­solves] into the drop of awakening. Then place your mind in equipoise within the sphere of the union of emptiness and compassion. This is the supplementary section of guru yoga [practice]. If all of these are condensed, they are but elaborations from and the drawing in of the awakening mind. It is crucial, therefore, to ensure that [all these practices] become medita­tive absorption on the awakening mind.Thus, together with the supplementary part, this is the sixteenth drop, the drop ofG reat Awakening, which marks the completion of the entry [into the sixteen drops].C.

Perfo rm in g th e d ed icationThus, having completed the meditation practices of the main session well, cease also the approximation [rites] and let the students drink from the vase water and use it for ablutions. Then, offer such substances as the three dairy products and the three sweet substances that are clean and attractive to the teachers, the deities, the Dharma protectors, and all the practitioners as well until they are satiated.

The Spiritual Mentors Birth as the Brahman Youth Ujjvala[277] When Atiía and his son were residing in Yerpa on the crest of Mount Lhari Nyingpo, Ngok Lekpai Sherap made the following plea to Drom Gyalwai Jungné: “For three years you, the conqueror and son, have taught the most profound and inconceivable teaching. This uncommon and unique [teaching], in twenty-three chapters, is called the Jew el Garland o f Dialogues. In it, you state:Discard all lingering doubtsAnd strive with dedication in your practice.“'“So how did you discard all lingering doubts and strive in meditative practice in the past? Pray with an affectionate heart, do tell me.”In response, Drom replied: “I am a childish ordinary being, chained by so many fetters. How is it possible that I have relinquished all lingering , doubts? As I have no supernormal cognition, it is also difficult to reveal to you how I might have dedicated myself to meditative practices in the past. So, although I may not have discarded all lingering doubts and striven with dedication in meditative practices, it is clear that, in general, for those who desire liberation, it is necessary to discard all lingering doubts and strive with dedication in the meditative practices.”As Drom spoke these words, Sangphuwa44’ made three prostrations to Atife and appealed: “This Gyalwai Jungné conceals all his higher qualities and does not reveal them, so please, teacher, speak to us about some of his qualities. He does have higher qualities, and you, the teacher, do not resort to exaggerations or denigrations. By hearing his qualities we will cultivate faith and reverence. This could also benefit future sentient beings as well. So, teacher, please do reveal [his higher qualitites] to us.”Atis'a replied: “The entirety of his higher qualities resembles a treasury"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"456 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mof precious jewels. His qualities are so great that they are difficult to con­tain in others’ minds, so you should not speak of them to others. [278] For your own retention, I shall explain a few, so listen.”Gyalwai Jungné exclaimed: “Given that there are profound teachings for you to teach that are auspicious in the beginning, middle, and end, what purpose is there, O sublime teacher, in presenting the numerous ways in which I wandered in cyclic existence? Instead, if those future beings who are unruly and whose soil of faith has been blown away by the bellows450 of false understanding approach you with the expression ‘well, in that case,’ it is more appropriate for you to reveal the profound teachings, as I have requested before. Please do not bring my heart out into the open.”Ngok interjected: “O spiritual mentor, I am not someone with a big mouth and a small brain. Leaving five hundred monks behind, I have come here to sever [the ropes of] my lingering doubts; so even if you won’t tell us, please do not prevent Atis'a from teaching us. Look at my head and my wrinkles as well and sustain me with your heart. Pray, sustain me with your heart!”Hearing this objection, the spiritual mentor dared not say anything. Then, in a raised triumphant voice, Atisa said, “Lekpai Sherap, you are right. I have decided to speak. Yet, since this is a heart counsel of us three— father and sons—alone, do not spread this to others.” Saying this, Atis'a told the following tale:“In the town of Kapila, there once lived a brahman named Sujata who was most learned in all disciplines of the brahmanical knowledge of the Vedas.451 He had a wife called Mano rama to whom a son was born. From an early age, he was intelligent and acted like an adult. The mother exclaimed, ‘He behaves like a grownup and he is highly intelligent. Definitely, he must be someone with special karma. It seems as if he natu­rally deserves his name Ujjvala [the luminous one] .452 He must be taught all the Vedas.’“So both parents taught him the Vedas, and he learned them without any difficulty. Thus, after seven years had passed, he became a brahman learned in all the Vedas and a source of wonder for everyone. At that time all the brahmans who were well versed in the Vedas gathered in Kapila to debate the Vedas, but no one was able to defeat the brahman youth Ujjvala, so the brahmans inquired, ‘How are you so learned in the Vedas at such a young age?’“The youth replied, ‘I have the fully awakened Buddha as my teacher,"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"T h e S p ir i t u a l M e n t o r 's B ir t h as th e B r a h m a n Youth U jjv a la 457[279] the sublime Dharma as my refuge, and the noble Sangha community as my savior. Through the force of being blessed by the Three Jewels, I am convinced of the law of karma. Therefore, I am not plagued with doubts and do not squander the fruits of past actions but strive in the virtues. This is why, even though I am young, I have become versed in the Vedas.’“As he spoke these words, they concurred, ‘Judging by the manner of his speech, he is certainly an emanation. We cannot debate with him.’ Saying this, they dispersed and left.“Then the youth Ujjvala went where his parents were. His parents asked, ‘Did you achieve the fame of being versed in the language of the Vedas today?’“The youth replied, ‘Parents, due to the Three Jewels being the domi­nant condition, yes, this has come to pass.’“His parents then asked, ‘Why is it that you possess the excellent con­dition of the Three Jewels?’“The youth responded, ‘The Three Jewels are concerned solely with the welfare of sentient beings, and I have conviction in karma and its effects, so these [two] auspicious conditions have come together.’“His parents asked, ‘Who taught you about this profound law of karma?’“The youth replied, ‘Once in this town of Kapila, when the prince known as Siddhärtha revealed himself as the son of Suddhodana, I was the brahman youth called Prakas'a.453 One day, as I was standing at the town’s gate, the prince, who was surrounded by a retinue of countless ministers, arrived at the gate and we came face to face. The prince then said, “O brah­man youth, all effects resemble their causes; none violate this law, so do not stand idle at this gate to the town. Because the mighty [afflictions] were slain by ethical discipline in the past, today you have been born as a human, so be endowed with morality today as well. In the future you will become a brahman youth called Ujjvala who will act wisely in accord with the law of karma. Harboring no doubts with regard to the truth and falsity of karma and its effects, you will undertake the meditative practices and will not deviate from [working for] the welfare of sentient beings.”“The parents, realizing that he was indeed an emanation, asked, ‘Will you remain at home and pursue others’ welfare? Or will you become a renunciare monk and pursue the welfare of sentient beings?’“The youth replied, ‘O parents, living at home is like [being in] a fire pit. Without finding a secure base oneself, how can one rescue others? [280]"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"4j8 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mBeing a renuncíate is like being in a cool chamber; one can rescue others who have fallen into a fire pit. O parents, if I remain at home and am caught in the mires, [it would be as if] no son was bom to you. I will fail to find a secure ground myself, and I will fail to rescue you two as well. And if I am unable to rescue other sentient beings, there will be no purpose to my having obtained a human existence. This life of leisure and opportu­nity would [then] become meaningless.’‘“His parents responded: ‘There are two ways of pursuing the welfare of sentient beings: there is the lay bodhisattva and the renuncíate monk bodhisáttva. Ujjvala, in this town known as Kapila, where there are four different castes and eighteen different categories of crafts, the humans here are blessed by a spiritual king, and thus there are numerous individuals who are wealthy. The foundation of faith is strong, and because of this, there are many fields for accumulating merit. Due to the power of this, there is a great respect toward those who are learned. In particular, those of us with the brahmanical knowledge of the Vedas are pure and excellent. Therefore, Ujjvala, remain here [at home] and pursue the welfare of sentient beings. For protection and refuge, you can seek the Three Jewels. Since you are versed in the language of the Vedas, you are free of ignorance and can, with­out satiation, enter the path, engage in the perfections, such as generosity, and partake in the experiences of the levels and the paths as well as higher qualities of the other shores.’“‘The son replied: ‘What you parents say is true. In general, there are two systems of spiritual practice— that of the insider and of the outsider. As for the outsider’s teaching, it should be shunned, though one needs to have the knowledge of it. With regard to the insider’s teaching, it is of benefit both to the wider community and to the individual. Its excellence is indicated by [the fact that] it cannot be contained in the minds of out­siders or those who are base. Therefore, the teaching of the insiders must be affirmed, and one needs to have its knowledge. This is twofold: the Great Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle. The Lesser Vehicle refers to the teach­ings of the disciples and the self-enlightened ones. Even these two are most profound compared with the teachings of the outsiders. Abandoning the countless parents who have been most kind and abiding principally in the pursuit of one’s own peace and discipline reflects little conscience and is shortsighted. However, even though they are to be shunned, they must be known. As for the Great Vehicle, even if one undergoes the unimaginable sufferings of the six classes of births in cyclic existence for the sake of all"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"sentient beings, who have all been one’s parents, since one perceives all of them as devoid of intrinsic existence by means of the three levels of under­standing, one will never deviate from [the pursuit of] their welfare. He is the son of the buddhas. This is the [true] path. [281] Compared to pursu­ing the practices of the disciples and self-enlightened ones for an eon, a sin­gle instance of this [Great Vehicle path] accrues greater merit. One must affirm this, and, therefore, must have its knowledge as well.“‘This [Great Vehicle] is twofold: the Middle Way and the Mind Only.454 The Middle Way, in turn, is twofold: the Mere Appearance Middle Way and the Utterly Nonabiding Middle Way.455 The Mere Appearance Middle Way establishes as false the phenomena that are [actually] false. They pres­ent this by means of the eight similes of illusion, such as dreams and so on. Here [too], since both what is being presented and the means by which it is presented are deceptive objects and subjects, they are to be abandoned. However, they must be known. As for the Utterly Nonabiding Middle Way, they state that whether the buddhas appear or not, the ultimate real­ity of all phenomena is utterly nonabiding. Therefore, one should affirm and know this [school] as well. The Mind Only [view] is twofold: those who propound appearances to be true and those who propound them to be false.454 Although, compared to the Utterly Nonabiding Middle Way, both of these are mistaken, they must be known nonetheless.“‘Alas! Parents, such is the ultimate mode of being of all phenomena. When analyzed they do not abide at all, so if I remain at home, I will delight in the extremes of elaborations of many arising and subsiding conceptual­izations. I will become involved in many chores. This is, in general, the defining characteristic of a samsaric being and, in particular, the character of a householder. O parents, am I not called the brahman youth Ujjvala? If I do not see [things] in this light, I will then be in darkness. Among the householders, those from Kapila [are from] a large town. There are many people and they delight in distractions. There are many who, due to the influence of their friends, have become just like the others. I am young, have an attractive appearance, and have a reputation for having a clear mind. Since both of you parents love me, it would be inappropriate if others were to lead me into the afflictions. Therefore, I seek to sever all lingering doubts that impede accomplishments and strive with dedication to achieve [the state of] Buddha, the lord of the world, which is the most perfect fruit.’ “His parents asked, ‘Son, if you are to become a renuciate monk, where do you wish to do so?

O Ujjvala, since you medi­tate on all sentient beings as your parents, we are your parents who reveal themselves in [this] body, so why do you make us suffer?’“Ujjvala replied: ‘You two are right. One’s native land is said to be like the house of Mara. In particular, one’s home is like a dungeon in a prison. It robs you of the life force of happiness. Mundane norms are a massive chain of bondage; they prevent you from journeying to the place of liber­ation. Sense objects are like poisons; for the moment they are delicious in your mouth, yet in the long run, they rob you of your life. O parents, there is no place here in this town of Kapila for me to dispel doubts and engage in meditative practices. I will seek a place that will enhance meditative practice. O my parents, if I am like your eyes, then eyes should look at forms. If they do not see forms, it is like not having eyes at all. O parents, having lived at home, I have failed to see the defects of cyclic existence and the benefits of nirvana. This is like not having eyes at all. Since I am like your heart I should serve the function of a heart. Since I am like your limbs I should serve the function of the limbs. Without a heart and limbs, you will be like a stuffed body with no limbs at all. O parents, I will be the heart that will keep firm the life of liberation. I will be the limbs that bring forth the benefits of nirvana. O parents, please be my peerless guides and take me to a place of solitude, a place where there are spiritual mentors.’“As he made this request, his parents exclaimed:O Ujjvala, you who are like our eyes:You have said, ‘I will go to a place of solitude,’And you have asked us to be your guide and take youTo a place where there are spiritual mentorsSo that you can strive in meditative practice and sever all doubts;In that case, engage in the virtues here.

I have made supplications to the special objects [of veneration] and have made pure aspiration prayers for the benefit of sentient beings as well. Thus, wherever I go, if the emanation beings exclaim, “Your spiritual mentors are your own parents, so discard all lingering doubts and engage in meditative practices right here [at home],”I will then do exactly as you, my parents, have advised. If I am told, how­ever, that my spiritual mentor and my place [of practice] are elsewhere in one of the cardinal or ordinal directions, I will then go to that place. Why? Because the ability of the Three Jewels is potent indeed, and it never devi­ates from the right moment when the time has come to guide a person of good fortune.’“One day, in the morning, he went to a lake known as the hovering geese,’ which lies to the south of Kapila town.

From a dis­tance they saw the brahman monk Abhayamati [290] giving teachings, in an uncluttered and unsullied manner, to eight brahman monks with dear intelligence. There the brahman youth Ujjvala felt great joy, like that of a mother who has just met her only son after not seeing him for many years. Standing between his two parents, he folded his ten fingers together with his two palms joined and placed them at his crown. Chanting the Vedas in a melodious voice, he came before the teacher. He touched the teacher’s feet with his crown, made prostrations, and, in accordance with custom, circumambulated [the teacher] three times.

The brahman youth constructed a small meditation hut. Dispelling all mundane doubts, he took ordination in the teacher Abhayamati’s presence and became immersed in a single-pointed meditative practice. At this, the malevolent Mära became unhappy, as if his own son had been snatched away. Assuming a form exactly like that of the teacher Abhayamati, he appeared inside the hut and said: ‘Nearly ten years have passed since you joined the life of a renuncíate monk, relinquished mundane distractions, and single-pointedly engaged in meditative practice. Now you have elimi­nated the objects of abandonment, achieved the antidotes, and have become a sublime being.

Then, after a month had passed, the teacher Abhayamati himself appeared and asked:Son, did you experience doubts because of Mara?Did you relapse from single-pointed practice?Did you mistake Mara for a teacher?Or did you instead generate even greater perseverance?“When he had asked this, the youth Ratna Ujjvala462 replied:One day as I was meditating single-pointedly,Mara appeared in the guise of the teacher and said:‘You have engaged in meditation for nine years;Now you can indulge in anything at your will.’Not giving rise to any doubts, I persevered even more.My pledge remains firm and most binding.“In response, the teacher said:O sublime being, most intelligent one.Well done, son of the Three Jewels.In the future, when the [last] five-hundred-year cycle dawns,"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"In a barbarian borderland, we two Shall enjoy the wealth of the Dharma;Together we shall engage in the welfare of beings.At that time your mother will have become A sublime being called Lekpai Sherap.At that time your mother will request all of todays [tales]—How you strove in the practiceWithout giving rise to doubts and with special effort,Even when Mära caused obstacles—And I shall reveal them.With his propensities awakened, he shall come to know.“This brahman monk was learned in all worldly and transworldly prac­tices. ‘Still,’ he blessed and advised, you should never waver from this [pur­suit] and, for as long as you live, discard all lingering doubts and ensure that you never allow this meditative practice to degenerate.’ Saying this, he departed to the pure realms.“For his part, the brahman monk also vowed, ‘Regardless of what obsta­cles befall me, since I have been blessed as Ratna Ujjvala [Illumination of the Three Jewels], I shall act in a way that is true to the meaning of this name.

The Spiritual Mentors Birth as Prince Asañga in Kausâmbhï[295] On another occasion, when Atis'a and his son were residing in Yerpa on the crest of Mount Lhari Nyingpo, Lekpai Sherap came into their presence, prostrated three times, and made the following plea: “O pandita most learned in the five fields of knowledge, yesterday you spoke clearly and extensively on how Gyalwai Jungné took extraordinary births in the past. You have [also] spoken a lot in the form of a dialogue pertaining to the following lines from the [Bodhisattvas] Jew el Garland:Thoroughly relinquish sloth, mental dullness, and laziness,And strive always with joyful perseverance.“So today, too, [I would like to ask,] how did Gyalwai Jungné abandon sloth, mental dullness, and laziness and how did he endeavor in joyful per­severance in the past? With a heart of devotion, I wish to hear this. As I am free of any [self-centered] expectations, O Atiáa, please speak of this to me out of a compassionate heart.”Once he had made this request, Atis'a inquired, “Are there any individ­uals here who are not suitable vessels?”Drom replied: “Right now there are only three of us: you, father, and your two sons. Later the words might be passed on to the others through the cracks in the walls. Today it seems you are going to speak. You, teacher, do not possess [the flaw of] exaggeration and denigration; and Ngok, you have no conceit based on your learning and knowledge. The foundation of your devotion and respect is great; you relate to your teachers and friends as teachers and friends, and you are skilled in both the spiritual and mun­dane norms.

You, too, O Atis'a, please speak in a way that is consonant with the facts.”As he thus gave his permission, an unprecedented fragrance arose, [296] fresh blue flowers rained down repeatedly, and a melodious voice could be heard exclaiming: “The conqueror and his son have dried up the ocean of attachment and aversion; they have extinguished the flame of false con­ceptions; they have lit the light illuminating the Buddhas teaching; and they have spoken of the enlightened qualities of the greatness of Lord Aval- okites'vara’s body. Because of this, all beings of the region of Tibet shall enjoy happiness.”Drom looked up in the sky and smiled, at which point, Ngok inquired, “Judging by the manner in which you are looking up in the sky and the presence of such a melodious voice and other extraordinary signs, there is no doubt that the assembly of meditation deities is indicating that this [telling of Drom’s birth story] is a good thing.”Atiia responded, “The gods are delighted at the explanation of the enlightened qualities of Lord Avalokitesvaras body and, carrying flowers and incense in their hands, are making offerings. The goddess Tara is also making immeasurable offerings of meditative absorptions. Ngok, you, too, should take these [offerings] with your mind and offer them. As Drom has advised, you should also offer in actuality a silver mandala adorned with a conch. This will have great significance.”Ngok replied, “Let alone a silver one, I do not even have a wooden man­dala today, so this does not help. If one does not endure some degree of hardship for the sake of receiving profound teachings, this is not appro­priate, so I will go to the plains today and search for a silver mandala. I will then return and receive the profound teaching.”“Ngok, do not harbor too many thoughts. All the deities have converged here. It is not possible to send so many gods away because of one human being, so today I will prepare the mandala myself,” replied Drom.Atisa intervened, “Drom, not that you can’t lay out your mandala, but it is Ngok who must perfect his accumulations, so I will give one to him.” Saying this, Atis'a took a silver mandala the size of an arm’s length from his robes and adorned it with one hundred and eight small conches. He placed this in Ngok’s hands and said, “I offer this to you to help fulfill the enlightened aspirations of such kind saviors as Serlingpa. On your part, too, [297] you should offer this to Gyalwai Jungné in order to help perfect your accumulations.”"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"Lekpai Sherap, in turn, offered the mandala to Drom with the state­ment, “In order to help accomplish my accumulations, I offer this man­dala to you.” With these words, he sat in Drom’s presence.Atiia then began in this way: “O Lekpai Sherap, once in a country called Kausambhï there lived a king by the name of Prabhâs'rï who had a queen named Sati, to whom two sons were born. They were named Räjyapäla and Asañga.463 Räjyapäla was mentally resourceful, loved wealth and luxury, and was highly possessive of the kingdom and domineering toward his countrymen. Arrogant, he would travel everywhere with a large retinue of young men and ministers as his servants. Asañga, on the other hand, was tranquil and disciplined. He did not desire to rule the kingdom, was con­tent with whatever food and clothing he received, and addressed everyone with pleasant words. When he visited pleasure groves and other places, he would bring along many young men who were like him, and, acting as their teacher, he would teach them the Dharma. [When they came to] ponds, he would create a toy ship and ferry many people across to the [other] shore. He would rescue those who had fallen low, and he would indulge in games with highly virtuous symbolism, such as making pros­trations, doing circumambulations, and so on. He would give away to others two thirds of the food that his parents gave him. Whenever he saw an ordained person, even if this person were several miles away, he would first be delighted and then, without hestiation, would rush to prostrate to the monk and circumambulate him. He would request, ‘Please come to my parents’ house. I would like to be within your presence. I aspire to be like you.’“Because he displayed extraordinary signs of virtue, everyone in Kauàâmbhï, irrespective of their age, bowed to him, exclaiming, ‘Such a prince is rare indeed in this world!’ His young companions would also point out to the prince whenever they saw an ordained person coming from any direction.“One day when King Prabhâs'rï went to the mountains to hunt, he saw, in a thicket of trees, a monk perfectly clad in the three robes [298] and seated upon a cushion of leaves and straw—a monk whose mere sight inspired perfect veneration. As the king dismounted from his horse and paid homage [to him], his retinue of five hundred also did the same. The king touched the monk’s feet with his head and requested the monk to come to the palace for lunch. The monk replied, ‘O Icing, you who are known as the Glorious Light464 have obtained a human existence, soT h e S p ir i t u a l M e n t o r ’s B i r t h as P r in c e A sa ñ g a in K a u id m b h i 479"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"480 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mdifficult to find, and among [humans], you have been born into the high caste of royalty. Yet you indulge in such base acts as hunting, making your obtainment of a human life and your royal birth devoid of purpose. In gen­eral, all sentient beings are our parents; and in particular, the animals who live on this mountain give us protection. However, you have betrayed them, so there is no way that I can come for lunch at your place.’“Once [the monk] had spoken, the king thought, ‘He is definitely an emanation monk. He knows my name, he is not deferential, and he gives me instruction in the form of a scolding.’ Thinking this, he replied, ‘Yes, what you say is true. I now confess my wrongs and purify them. I resolve never to commit them in the future, and I will make sure never to be divorced from humility, so please do come for lunch tomorrow.’“‘If I really have to come to your place for lunch tomorrow, you must give me your son named Asañga,’ the monk replied.“The king responded, ‘In general, a Icing’s dominion must be held by the prince, and that prince should be someone whom everyone respects. Here in Kausimbhï, everyone, regardless of their age, reveres my son Asañga and takes him to their crown without any rival. Please allow him to rule over my kingdom. Apart from him, O noble one, whatever you may desire, I shall fulfill your wish.’“‘It is because your son has such great qualities that I want him. Other­wise, as I, too, am known as Attachment-Free, I have no need for a youth who is attachment-ridden. Your son Asañga was a prince who succeeded in reigning over my kingdom in numerous lifetimes in the past and he will continue to do so in the future until his arrival at the heart of enlighten­ment. [199] Because he has two parents today, I have asked for him. Besides, even if your son Räjyapäla rules over your kingdom, [Asañga] will still remain the prince who will succeed [in reigning] my kingdom. [Räjyapäla] could lead the life of a householder bodhisattva and be allowed to reign over your kingdom. However, if you let Asañga rule over your kingdom, your dominion will become no more,’ replied the monk.“Then, the king thought, ‘This noble one is definitely an emanation; there is no doubt about it. He revealed the names of both my sons and spoke about their realities.’ Wondering why it was that his kingdom would come to an end if Asañga were allowed to rule it, he asked, ‘Pray tell me, why is it that, if Asañga is made to rule, my kingdom will come to an end?’ “The monk replied, ‘A kingdom is like a poisonous tree: its branches, leaves, and flowers are most striking and have a sweet and delicious taste,"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"but whosoever consumes it will lose his life. A kingdom is like a burning fire pit: he who goes into it will be burned by the flames of desire. A king­dom is like a prison: one will be surrounded by enemies in the end. A kingdom is like an iron chain of bondage: it will prevent you from walk­ing toward liberation. O king, since this is so, it is impossible for Asañga to rule over your kingdom. [For him] being dead is tolerable but falling into the lower realms is not. Will Asañga remain heedless at this juncture when he has obtained an existence that is the basis for [attaining] all higher qualities?’‘At these words of the monk, the king became disheartened. ‘You, noble one, have described my kingdom to be a source of such shortcomings. You have shown that Asañga took birth as my son purely out of great compas­sion. You have revealed that Asañga will recognize the shortcomings of my kingdom and will recognize it as being like a poison tree, a fire pit, a prison, and an iron chain of bondage. You have revealed that Asañga will forsake everything and, in accord with the truth, journey to happiness. You have revealed that, even if the prince were to rule over the kingdom, this would be an apparition. 1 recognize that this will be done in order to tame the householders of Kaus'àmbhï. O noble one, just as you have stated, [300] the conduct of Asañga is that of a bodhisattva. He gives away to others two thirds of the food we parents give him. All the games he plays accord with the Dharma. When ordained people come, he receives them even from a distance of several miles. He is definitely a person of [great] karma.’“Thinking there was nothing he could do other than comply with the noble one’s request, the king said, ‘It is difficult to counter what you say. O noble one, I shall offer Asañga to you, just as you have asked. Further­more, in order to fulfill your wishes, I will offer to you whatever you desire.’ Then he implored, ‘Please do come tomorrow.’“The monk replied, ‘You, Prabhâsrï, the king of Kausàmbhï, have now agreed to act in accord with the truth, so today you should return to your land. Tomorrow I will come to your palace. This evening when you return to your palace, you should announce to the entire city that tomorrow a noble one will arrive and everyone who comes to receive him should go for refuge to the Three Jewels.’“As advised, King Prabhâsrï returned to Kausàmbhï, where his palace was, and made the announcement as instructed. There, prince Räjyapäla asked the king, ‘O sovereign of humans, where are the animal carcasses?’ To this the king replied:T h e S p ir i t u a l M e n t o r ’s B i r t h as P r in c e A s a ñ g a in K a u s à m b h ï 481"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"482 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mIn the past I have killed many animals;But today in the rocky mountains,I heard it said that they are my parents.I feel remorse for my past.

There, in the garden, he saw his younger brother surrounded by twelve thousand youths. In the manner of playing a game, he was teaching them the Dharma. As Räjyapäla walked into the garden, he heard his younger brother Asanga speaking these words as if in a game:In springtime the most striking flowers Draw swarms of bees with joyful buzzing;A change of season robs their luster and pales them.This change in time and in nature is amazing indeed.0 thousands of youths, you who resemble flowers,Today, as youths, you are striking indeed to behold.Yet once you have aged— [30z]Once your nature and time have changed and you have become old— Even if they look at you, the bee-like people will no longer be attracted to you.Even the eight-year-old gradually becomes fifty.The fifty-year-old eventually becomes one hundred years old.Life spent, body aged, the young will recoil at you.The beautiful and attractive flowers of spring Do not last in summer, but change their forms.And even the flowers of summerSurely turn into something else by autumn.In winter who will be attracted to them?That which has birth in whatever form Is transient and will soon come to an end.1 am like a beautiful spring flower:Undamaged, with an attractive face, I am free of physical defects.O youths, you who resemble the swarm of honey bees,Drawn toward me, you have assembled here in the garden.

Instead, it might be better to occupy him with other topics of con­versation and not raise the subject of the noble one.’ Thinking like this, he sat down with an animal carcass in front of him.“Although in the past it was the elder brother who would lead, today it was Asañga who was in the lead as they entered the palace. They saw the king there with an animal carcass lying in front of him. [Seeing this] Prince Asañga exclaimed:Those whose kindness to us in the past, since beginningless time, Cannot be repaid, even if we strive to—Those parents in the guise of wild animals—Have you slain some of them?“The father replied:I have no power of supernormal cognition;I doubt whether they are my parents.Though I have robbed them of their lives,Pray do not be displeased.“Then Râjyapâla said:"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"O great father, please do not pretend.[The monk] possesses unobstructed supernormal cognition.Today I saw him teach the Dharma In front of thousands of youths;I’ve heard his sacred words, so difficult to reject.If he is being revered for no reasonBy thousands of youths who take him to their crown,0 sole father, why do you disparage him?In peace, speak your heart to him.Though I could tell you the truth,1 might err and cause you to lose heart.Alas! Great father, keep this in your mind:You should speak the truth.In general, lies have only a short life.You in particular, O king, are an authority.How can it be appropriate to speak lies To fulfill your own interests? [304]If I have erred, however, please forgive me.“Once he had made this request, the father replied, ‘Tomorrow I will collect together all my mistakes and confess them. Since the aspirations of this prince, who possesses supernormal cognition, will be realized tomor­row, today in order not to violate the wishes of your parents, please remain here this night single-pointedly contemplating the welfare of other beings.’ “Asañga understood [his father’s wish] and was delighted. He walked into the temple of the Three Jewels, and there, with his two legs folded [into meditation posture], his body erect and straight, and his ten fingers and palms pressed together, he spoke in a most melodious voice:You who save [beings] from that which is so hard to be rescued from;You who lead [beings] from a burning fire to cool [places];You who transform poisonous sap into medicine—To you, the Three Jewels, I go for refuge.Here in this limitless ocean of cyclic existence,Even though I wander under the power of karma,T h e S p i r i t u a l M e n t o r ’s B i r t h a s P r in c e A s a ñ g a in K a u s ä m b h i 487"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"488 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mO Three Jewels, you who are my unexcelled saviors—You are my most excellent lamp.You are the glory virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end.Even a mere supplication to you helps Grant the fulfillment of one’s wishes—To you, the Three Precious Jewels, I bow.Even if hundreds of ill-born bodies crumble,Never will I transgress your sacred words.“While he spoke these words, the hair on his body stood on end and his eyes filled with tears. [From then on,] overcoming sleep and mental dull­ness, he always conducted himself in [such a selfless] manner with great perseverance. When his two parents witnessed this, they both thought, ‘If our son, who is so young and has plenty of opportunity to enjoy life, dis­regards sleep and mental dullness, goes for refuge to the Three Jewels, and makes such fervent supplications with perfect reverence, how can we indulge in sleep and remain in heedlessness?’ Thinking like this, and not indulging too much in sleep and mental dullness, they followed their son’s example.“The next morning, as sunrise approached, the noble one entered the palace. Prince Asañga went there and touched the noble one’s feet with his head. He prostrated to him, made offerings to him, and, once he had arranged a perfect seat, made a request [to the noble one] to be seated:Though you possess no afflictions, [305]In order to help liberate these countless parents From all [categories of] afflictions,Pray be seated here and attend to me with compassion.“Once [Asañga] had made this request, the noble one sat down with the generation of perfect [awakening] mind for the benefit of all the parents since beginningless cyclic existence, including [Asañga’s] two parents. Joined by his parents and his elder brother, Prince Asañga then made the following supplication:In the past, since beginningless samsara,Like maggots infesting a pile of excrement,"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"I have remained submerged in afflictions’ mire;Thus, I have failed to journey to the place of purity.Today, most compassionate noble one,Continuously pour upon us your blessing stream;Imperfect beings such as us Are like fish cast onto a dry shore.In the past, in coundess lifetimes,Though I was sustained by you, the noble one,The fetters of the afflictions remained undone.Today, help cut the fetters [of bondage].In the future, throughout all lives,Under the kindness of you, O noble one,I will help lead my most kind parents.May I become the source of conquerors.“Thus, with conviction, he made fervent supplications to which the monk replied:Though there are many jewels in the world,The Precious Jewel remains a mere possibility.Though many have obtained a human life,One endowed with faith is similarly [rare].Prince, you are most fortunate;Since you possess the fertile soil of faith—The foundation of all higher qualities—The harvests of virtue will increase in abundance.As for beings endowed with fortune,You will help them attain excellent happiness.You are indeed a person of great faith;To help enhance, at all times, the goodness That brings excellence throughout the entire world,The rain of compassion shall fall continuously.Do not be disheartened, O Asañga.I, too, am known as Asañga.T h e S p ir i t u a l M e n t o r s B ir t h a s P r in c e A s a ñ g a in K a u s à m b h ï 489"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"4 9° T h e B o o k o f K a d a mI will help undo your fetters;I am the one who has reached the secure ground;I am a friend [to you] at all times;So look at me with a pure heart.Unsoiled by any shortcomings,I am an object of refuge even for the gods.I alone am the savioress of the world.4“In the future, when glorious Dipamkara appears,You shall be his principal son.Since you possess no defects,You display errors just to accord with the world.Now, relinquishing these stains of errors,Like darkness when the sun rises,You should depart to the forests. [306]“Upon these words of [the monk], Asañga, his parents, and the servants, felt deep devotion and reverence. They then prepared meals composed of the mixture of the three dairy products and three sweets, which are appro­priate to be consumed by renuncíate monks and brahmans. Untainted by unclean substances and prepared in the most perfect clean process, the food was offered to the noble one. On the noble ones part as well, he enjoyed the meal to help perfect the prince, the king and queen, and the prince’s elder brother in their accumulation [of merit]. To help ensure that [their merit] would remain inexhaustible, the noble one made a dedication:Most accomplished sublime beingsWith unobstructed eyes and supernormal cognition, pray attend.I dedicate this merit to the supreme Buddha,The sublime refuge of all beings.“As he recited these lines, the prince, together with his parents and elder brother, also joined in the dedication. He then made the following aspiration:Just as now, I will venerateThe sublime noble one throughout all my lives;"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"T h e S p i r i t u a l M e n t o r ’s B ir t h as P r in c e A s a ñ g a in K a u s à m b h ï 491Sustained by [the power of] pure aspirations,May I journey to the ultimate destination.“Then Prince Asañga rose up. With his palms pressed together, he came before his parents and asked, ‘O you two, embodiments of great kindness, you who have given me the light of this world, do you love me?’“The parents replied, ‘So much that we are incapable of being apart from you.’“‘Do you love not being separated for a short period, or do you love not being separated at all times?’ the prince asked.“‘The latter,’ the parents replied.“‘In that case,’ the prince replied, ‘I will follow after this noble one and forsake food, drink, clothing, bedding, my palace, pleasure gardens, play­mates, sleep, mental dullness, and all activities of heedlessness. Single- pointedly, I will seek life’s final aim so that, from life to life, wherever I may take rebirth, you two can be my parents and we will never be apart from each other. On your part, too, if you two wish never to be separated from me, you should, from the depth of your hearts, entrust yourself to the Three Jewels. Since the causal connections of karma and its effects are pro­found, refrain even from the slightest misdeeds. Since an ocean of higher qualities can emerge from the accumulation [of merit], collect this even by way of single drops. Since you need a staircase to journey to the place of liberation, observe ethical discipline and make your human existence the foundation. [307] Since profound Dharma can attract mâras, constantly strive to venerate the Three Jewels. Since this cyclic existence is subject to suffering, cultivate loving-kindness, compassion, and awakening without interruption. Since [all beings] are our parents alone, do not discriminate in terms of closeness and distance or partialities, and when they are happy, cultivate the good thought of rejoicing. O parents, if you conduct your­selves in this manner, you will have cared for me. This will help fulfill your prayers for being with me throughout all lives. Otherwise, there are so many sentient beings who have been my parents. I, too, have died and taken birth so many times, and there is no certainty that you two alone will be my parents.’“The two parents asked, ‘If we send you, son, our heart, to follow the noble one, is it certain that in the future we two will become your parents and you our son?’“The prince replied:"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"49i T h e B o o k o f K a d a mO noble one, be my witness.0 my two parents,In the future, in the last five-hundred-year cycle,On the crest of snow mountains,My father, Prabhàs'rï, so named By the dâkinïs of Udhyâna,Will be Drom’s father, Yaksher Kushen.467 My mother, the devout Sati,Will be known as Khuö Salenchikma.1 will be born on that crest of snow mountains.At that time I will be sustained by Attachment-Free.0 noble one, is this a delusion?“The noble one replied:It is just as you say, supreme son.In that imperfect hinterland of the foolish,Since the light of Dharma has not shone,In that buffer land that resembles darkness,You, moon-like [light], will take your birth And dispel the darkness of mind.At that time I, Attachment-Free,Will appear there like the sun.1 will bring daylight to many fortunate ones.Then I will depart to the realm of Tusita.As if possessing attachment, you, Asañga Will reside there and lead the imperfect beings.“The prince replied:What will be the teachers excellent name then?In what way will I be validated?“The noble one replied:I will be known as Dipamkara,Dispelling the darkness of that land."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"T h e S p ir i t u a l M e n t o r ’s B ir t h as P r in c e A sa rig a in K a u s ä m b h i 493You will be a treasury of Buddhas teaching Known as Gyalwai Jungné.I will be the ‘great Atis'a,’Venerated by the name ‘the sole god.’You will be Upâsaka Dharmavardana,46'Venerated as the spiritual mentor Tönpa.

O prince, if you complete whatever activities you may initiate, then you are truly a sublime person, so now, after having departed to the great forests, do not commit even a single instance of any unethical deed. If you become enamored with sleep, mental dullness, food, drinks, and so on, this would be like the foolish man who, failing to enjoy himself when there was food with hundredfold flavors, collected even the few grains of rice dropped by birds and hoarded them.’“The prince replied, ‘Just as you have advised, I will forsake unethical acts and engage only in ethical activity.’“The king then rose and, with palms pressed together, said in the pres­ence of the noble one: ‘For the benefit of all sentient beings in general and, in particular, to help we two elderly parents perfect our accumulation [of merit], we offer you Asanga, who is like our own hearts. Pray accept him out of compassion. I also seek forgiveness from you, O noble one, for the wrongs I have committed by inflicting harm upon the many wild animals I failed to recognize as my parents. From now on, even at the cost of my life, I will never slay any beings who have been my parents.’“The noble one was deeply pleased with his supplication and made a prayer:You who are a ruler in the world,You who were born into the high royal caste,Together with your queen and sons,Since you offer your son to me for the benefit of the Dharma,May you always be cared for by the noble ones as their children,As well as by all [other] beings."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"4 9 4 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m“Speaking these words and taking Prince AsaAga along with him, the noble Attachment-Free instantly disappeared from the palace through his supernormal power.“When Attachment-Free and his spiritual son arrived in the great for­est, the noble one gave a hut made of leaves to Prince Asañga and said, ‘I will be your preceptor and your master of the ordination ceremony.

Cultivate compassion toward them for their suffering in cyclic existence and develop perseverance in all possible ways so that, ultimately, they will attain buddhahood. You should gain mastery over all these [practices] within the sphere of the absence of substantial reality.’ Then he gave the following instruction:You have taken coundess lives in the past.You were not born to one set of parents alone;For every birth you’ve had a set of parents.Though sentient beings might appear countless,There is none who has not been your parent.So if you possess great compassion,You’ll have impardal loving-kindness as well.You’ll rejoice in everyone’s attainment of buddhahood.These are the four immeasurable thoughts.

His wife was called Karabha, and she gave birth to a son named Sañghavardana. All the townspeople had great affection for the house­holder and, upon hearing that a son was born to him, they brought excel­lent clothes, food, and beverages and gathered together. Not long after his birth, the son sat up cross-legged on his mothers lap, looked at everyone with eyes wide open, and smiled. This gready surprised everyone. They said that in the future he would create many ordained ones and would become a spiritual teacher for the town. When he reached age six or seven, he asked his parents to bring his three robes.‘“What are the three robes?’ his parents asked.‘“They are the lower robe, to cover the sites of shame; the upper robe, to help engage in heedfulness; and the patched [yellow] robe of excellence,’ he replied.“His two parents responded, ‘All of these are clothes of renuncíate monks, and patched robes are garments of a fully ordained celibate monk. Son, you cannot obtain these clothes yet.’“The son replied to them, ‘He who no longer makes the afflictions in the home of the afflictions is a renuncíate monk. He who refrains even from minor and minute misdeeds by his three doors is a fully ordained monk. These three [robes] are his clothes. I, too, am a renuncíate monk, fully ordained, who has seen the defects of cyclic existence, who has per­ceived the benefits of nirvana, who relinquishes the poisonous sap-like cycle of existence, and who embraces medicine-like nirvana.

I will discipline my mental continuum, [315] wear the clothes of ethical disci­pline, and tie my robes with the sash of the antidotes of a sense of shame and conscience. To guard against the rough terrain of nonvirtue I will wear the boots of the view of the ten virtues. I will nurture the conduct of the skillful means of helping others.

Seeing this, the parents fainted in the town square. “At this point, the youth said:My kind parents are sad;All-permeating awareness is empty.This ill-born body of mine is a source of pain—First it is the soil that nurtures suffering;In the end, through decay it assumes its present [suffering] state.

Then, everyone lived equally in dwellings beyond the bounds of human habitats, [319] such as in places of extreme solitude that are five hundred yojanas or five hundred krosas away from any town. During all these periods, they shunned thoughts of gain and fame or of gifts and services. They did not indulge in the enjoyment of praise, eulogies, or flower adornments. Just like wild animals, they ensured that their dwellings were beyond the towns. Just like the carcasses of dead ani­mals, they remained free of preconceptions and interacted with all things with no sense of attachment. They lived there, untainted by negative friends and unsoiled by all the conventional norms of townspeople. They were propitiated and revered by all the gods, nagas, and yaksas.

Or shall I tell one that can withstand the test of time?”“How many births were there when he was kind, most kind?” inquired Khutön.Atisa replied: “Many times he was learned; many times he was disci­plined; later he was many times born kind; and many times he was born as a great king. As for all the other life stories, even the Buddha would be unable to count them.”The spiritual mentor interjected, “Tell the story of how I once dug up an elephant’s corpse.” Atiia agreed and told the following story:“Once, in the past, in a town called Sukhavat, the great Drom was born as a religious king named Saranadatta. You, great Khu, were born as his minister Samudäcära, and my great Amé475 was born as the queen Asañga- kosa.

She cared for everyone as if they were her children.“At the center of this town was an extremely wide and deep well. [322] One day, an elephant fell into this well.

As everyone in the town suffered from the lack of water, it occurred to King Saranadatta, ‘The townspeople are suffering due to lack of water. With the power of the blessed buddhas who are endowed with great compassion, I will extract the elephants carcass and lead all these beings to happiness.’ Thus, both the king and his minister went to the well, where the king commanded his minister, ‘Look after my body so that no harm comes to it. I will enter the elephants carcass with my consciousness and bring it out.’“Issuing this command, he went to the bottom of the well. The minis­ter, however, left his own body, entered the king’s body, and maimed his own body with lacerations. After the king had entered the elephant’s body and brought it out of the well, he noticed that his own body was now gone and only the maimed body of his minister was left behind. Seeing he could not enter the minister’s body, he [spotted] the corpse of a parrot’s body with no injuries and entered it.“At that time, a large number of merchants were converged in a [nearby] garden. At night [the parrot] would help round up the caravan animals that had gone astray. He would sing comforting lullabies and give solace to the merchants by encouraging them to sleep with peace. He would sing won­drous songs like the following:Human life is so difficult to find.With sun-like faculties free of darkness,You [now] pursue your mundane aspirations,But on the day you die,All the possessions you acquired with such effort will be left behind. If you journey alone and naked,Seek the lasting garment of morality;Think that nothing else is meaningful.When self-grasping attachment enters your heart,You’ll deceive even your father, who is worthy of respect.‘Though one [the father] may look after many [children],The many [children] cannot carry the weight of the one’; Unreliable, false thoughts increase in them toward their kind one."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"T h e S p ir i t u a l M e n t o r ’s B ir t h a s P r in c e S a r a n a d a tta 509You have failed to see karma and its long-term effects.Even if you engage in minor virtues That grant some partial joys,If you fail to prevent the subtle obstacles,You’ll say, The Dharma is not true either, for such things occur.’With no means of escape, you’ll go to the lower realms.

The master commanded, ‘Until you have brought me the corpse, do not look back, do not speak, and do not rest, for if you do any of these you will fail to bring back the corpse.’ However, because the corpse told stories like these [ones I’ve mentioned (e.g., the pandita and the stairs)], the king would fail in his mindfulness and exclaim, ‘What a wonderful story!’ Say­ing, ‘You cannot keep secret what is meant to be kept secret,’ the corpse would then get lost and would not be retained.“This corpse also told a story about two birds. Finally, the corpse asked, ‘On each of the thirteen steps on a staircase, there are thirteen birds, and in each of the bird’s beaks there are thirteen grains of barley. How many grains are there?’ Before he could complete the calculation, the king reached the master’s presence. Then, three nights later, [they] applied alchemy to the zombie, which is said to still exist in India, transforming it into gold. I heard all of these stories most clearly from an Indian pandita. He would count the golden hills to be thirteen or up to twenty-one.”Atis'a observed, “This translator has heard all sorts of things! Keep in your mind this story of how, failing to heed his master’s command, the king lost the corpse [so many times] and seal your mouth tight. Secrecy is important.“In closing, Khu, irrespective of where he took birth, this Drom never defamed the Dharma, he admired whatever teachings he found most affinity with, he strove both day and night in pursuit of the ten spiritual activities, [32.9] he dedicated the virtues of the three times for the benefit of all sentient beings, he was never divorced from the seven limbs, and, rec­ognizing defective forms of speech, he ensured that he was free from the faults of mind.”Thus, from the presentation of the life cycles of Drom Gyalwai Jungné, which have been made complete to Khu, this concludes the twenty-second life cycle, the chapter on how [our spiritual mentor] took birth as King Saranadatta, which is based upon the following lines:Never defame the teachings.481Whatever practices you admire,"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"ji8 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mUp to:Among others guard your speech;When alone guard your mind.With these, from among the twenty-two Son Teachings, the two teach ings for Khutön are complete."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Part Three Supplementary Texts"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"IX.

Is this not so?”Atiia responded: “Even if you abide in accord with the three vows and remain pure, as long as your mind is not disenchanted with the three realms of cyclic existence, you will create the conditions for turning the wheel again. [Also,] even if you strive through your three doors in the virtues both day and night, if you lack the knowledge of how to dedicate them toward full awakening, they will be eroded through some distorted"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"j6o T h e B o o k o fK a d a mconceptualization.

[356]The best instruction is the constant observation of your mind.The best antidote is the recognition that everything is devoid of intrinsic existence.The best conduct is being at variance with the mundane world.The best higher attainment is the lessening of your mental afflictions.The best sign of higher attainment is a decrease in your attachment. The best giving is the absence of possessiveness.The best morality is a tranquil mind.The best forbearance is to uphold humility.The best joyful perseverance is to be able to let go of the endeavor. The best concentration is the uncontrived mind.The best wisdom is to make no identification of “I am” with any thing.The best spiritual teacher is to challenge your weaknesses.The best instruction is to strike at your very own shortcomings.The best friends are mindfulness and introspective awareness.The best motivating factors are your enemies, obstacles, illnesses, and sufferings.The best skillful means is to be free of apprehensions.The best beneficial deed is to help [someone] enter the Dharma. The best help given is to turn [someone’s] thoughts to the Dharma.* * *Dromtönpa asked, “What is the most final of all teachings?”"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 561“The most final among all teachings is the emptiness that is endowed with the essence of compassion,” Atis'a replied.He continued, “For example, in the world there is a medicine called ‘the powerful single remedy that counteracts all illnesses. In the same manner, like the powerful single-remedy medicine, if you realize the truth of empti­ness, which is the [ultimate] nature of reality, this becomes an antidote against all afflictions.”When asked, “If this is true, why is it that all those who claim to have realized emptiness have failed to minimize their attachment and anger?” Atisa replied:“These [people] have arrived at mere, empty words, for if you have gen­uinely realized the truth of emptiness, then your body, speech, and mind are like a cotton cloth that has been [softened by constant] pressing down under the feet or like [hot] barley soup into which butter has been thrown for seasoning. Master Äryadeva states that even if you develop a mere doubt as to whether the ultimate mode of being of things is empty, this will shred cyclic existence to pieces.5\"1 Therefore, if you have realized the truth of emptiness without error, this would resemble [the finding of] the power­ful single-remedy medicine. Thus, all the teachings of the path are encom­passed within it.”* * *“How is that all the teachings of the path are encompassed within the real­ization of emptiness?” asked Dromtönpa. [357]Atis'a replied: “All the teachings of the path are embodied in the six per­fections. And if [practitioners] realize the truth of emptiness without error, they will be free of deep desire and grasping attachment; hence, there is the uninterrupted perfection of giving. Since those who are free of grasping and attachment are not soiled by the stains of nonvirtue, there is the unin­terrupted perfection of ethical discipline. Since they are devoid of anger from grasping at ‘I am’ and ‘mine,’ there is the uninterrupted perfection of forbearance. Since they are endowed with joy at the truth that has been realized, there is the uninterrupted perfection of joyful perseverance. Since they are free of distractions grasping at phenomena as substantially real, there is the uninterrupted perfection of concentration. Since they are free of conceiving anything in terms of the three spheres,515 there is the unin­terrupted perfection of wisdom.\""},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"562 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m* * *“If this is so, for one who has realized the truth, is it through the view of emptiness and its meditation alone that one becomes fully enlightened?” asked Dromtönpa.The master replied, “Nothing in this world of appearance and [every­day] convention does not come into being from one’s own mind. The mind, too, is an empty awareness, and the recognition of it [i.e., the empty mind] as the nonduality of awareness and emptiness is the view. Abiding in this continuously with mindfulness, free of distraction, is the medita­tion. The gathering of the two accumulations from within such a state in an illusion-like manner is the action. When one can accomplish this in one’s immediate experience through one’s practice, this will become possi­ble in dreams [as well]. When this becomes possible during dreams, it will [then] be possible at the time of death. When this becomes possible at the point of death, it will [then] become possible during the intermediate state [as well]. And when this happens during the intermediate state, one is cer­tain to achieve the supreme attainment [of buddhahood].”* * *Once when Master Atisa was residing at Nyethang, the three teachers Shang Nachung Tönpa, Gyura Tönpa, and Lhetsang Tönpa asked him about the tenets of the [Indian] logico-epistemological schools.516Atiáa said: “There are many philosophical systems of both non-Buddhist and Buddhist schools, all of which are but garlands of conceptualization. Conceptualizations are beyond calculation and they have no use. As there is no time to spare in life, now is the time to seek what is most essential.”Shang Nachung Tönpa then asked, “How does one seek what is most essential?”Atis'a replied: “Train your mind to cultivate loving-kindness and com­passion toward all sentient beings, who equal the expanse of space. [358] For their sake, strive to gather the two accumulations and dedicate all roots of virtue that arise from this toward the full enlightenment of all sentient beings. Be sure that you recognize the nature of all of these as empty and their characteristics as being like dreams and illusions.”* * *When Master Atis'a first visited Ngari he lived there for two years.

Furthermore, as you cannot have any certainty as to how long you might live, seek to accomplish swiftly what you most aspire for.“Do not say, ‘I am a fully ordained monk,’ while consorting with activ­ities of mundane livelihood, such as [acquiring] material possessions.“Do not say, ‘I am a hermit monk,’ while harboring the pain of having your mundane pursuits undermined— or the fear of this happening—even though you are residing in the wilderness.“Do not say, ‘I am a hermit monk,’ while your mind remains not divorced from an admiration of this life’s sensual pleasures and of harmful intentions.“Do not say, ‘I am a hermit monk,’ while not relinquishing association with the worldly even though you are residing in the wilderness, or while continuing to expend your time in frivolous chatter, or in conversations pertaining to a householder’s life, with whosoever happens to be around.“Do not say, ‘I am a bodhisattva monk’ while being incapable of bear­ing even the slightest harm to yourself caused by others or while doing even the slightest benefit to others.“If you continue to say so, despite [such actions], you are telling a great lie to the world. Even though you might be able to make such claims to"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f the K a d a m M a s te r s 567the world, you cannot do so to those who possess the divine eyes, unob­structed at all times. Second, you cannot make such claims, for the law of karma and its effects follows after you. Third, you cannot do so to the beings who possesses the eyes of the Dharma. [361] Furthermore, remem­ber what you have pledged in the presence of the meditation deities and the teachers when you generated the awakening mind.“When you encounter things that try your patience, do not become despondent or exclaim, ‘O this is difficult!’ and fail to practice forbearance. Remember that even though [this may be] difficult, you have no choice but to face it. Hesitation born of such thoughts as whether something is difficult or not is relevant only to the period prior to talcing the vows and making the pledge. After you have taken the vows and made the pledge, if you undermine them, this constitutes deceiving the meditation deities and the teachers. Therefore, even if it is difficult, remember that there is no choice but to practice forbearance.“Also, the purpose of residing in the wilderness is to forsake association with the worldly and to relinquish clinging to friends and family. As you relinquish these, this ensures the cessation of all causes and conditions of distraction and conceptualization, such as yearning for sensual objects; thus, you look [only] at the precious mind of awakening, so never, even for a sin­gle instant, follow after the thought that worries about mundane pursuits.“Because of failing to engage correctly in the practice of Dharma in the past, and because of the weak habituation of your mind to [such practice], mundane conceptions arise frequently, and they also remain powerful. Therefore, if you fail to apply special antidotes against them, residing in the wilderness will be pointless, for then you will be like the birds and the wild animals that live there. Do not think that, since it is too difficult at present, you will engage in the practice later on, for if a blind person loses hold of a precious jewel, he will not find it again.“When you undertake the practice, do not measure in terms of years and months; rather, analyzing your mind, assess the level of your realization on the basis of the depth of your habituation [to the practices]. Examine whether or not the afflictions are diminished. Constantly watch your mind. Do not inflict suffering upon yourself; do not deceive yourself; do not deceive the meditation deities and the teachers; and do not do things that spell doom for both self and others.“Even if the pursuits of this mundane life are undermined, [this is good, for] that which must be undermined is becoming so. For example, if there"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"j68 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mis a mass of filth in front of you, you have to clean it with a broom and throw it away. If someone were to help you do this, wouldn’t you be delighted? In the same way, whatever conceptualizations there are pertain­ing to the affairs of this life must be relinquished with all available anti­dotes, and if your teachers and special friends help you do this, won’t you be delighted? [362]“Having made the pledge in the presence of meditation deities and the teachers, do not discriminate among the objects of your giving. Although differences do exist among the objects, as far as training your mind in the awakening mind is concerned, there is no difference [among them].“Do not be angry toward those who perpetrate harm, for if you get angry about those who cause harm, when will you practice forbearance? Whenever afflictions arise, it is necessary to remember their antidotes. What point is there in a Dharma practice that allows the afflictions to roam free? So when looking at the precious awakening mind, do this without giv­ing a single opening to loss of mindfulness, for when a gap is opened due to degenerated mindfulness, the märas of afflictions will enter, and if they do, they will create obstacles for the awakening mind. When this happens, remember that this will undermine others’ welfare, and for yourself, too, there will be no choice but [a birth in] the lower realms. Even though you might have the thought, ‘I have practiced Dharma,’ this will be meaning­less, and you will go empty-handed.“O noble son, when you finally die, be sure you do not cause your teach­ers and your special friends to feel sorrow and disappointment. Do not cause the worldly people who are interested in Dharma to become disap­pointed and doubtful.“If you do not probe again and again by comparing your own mind with the sacred scriptures, even though you might feel, ‘I have practiced Dharma,’ the practice and the person will remain far apart. And if, when you die, instead of experiencing the signs of having trained your mind in the awakening mind, you experience the signs of the lower realms, others will have no option but to feel disappointment and sorrow. Therefore, giv­ing up entirely the practice tainted with the vain thought, ‘I have spent my entire life in Dharma practice,’ ensure that at the point of death you will not be empty-handed.“In brief, even if you reside in the wilderness, if you fail to let go of mun­dane pursuits and fail to avert your mind from yearning for sensual objects, then the Dharma has failed to benefit you. This is called ‘not having done"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 569one’s task.’ If you hope to conduct yourself in such a manner that both this life and future lives are not undermined, then Dharma practice has become [only] a hobby for you. Such a hobby will remain nothing but a Dharma practice of words, food, and pretense.“Therefore, rely on special friends; do not associate with negative com­panions; do not reside in fixed locations; and do not stay at one place and hoard contaminated possessions. Whatever you do, do so by relating it to the Dharma. Ensure that whatever you do becomes an antidote to the afflictions. When you conduct [yourself] in this manner, it becomes per­fect Dharma practice, so put effort into this. [363] If higher qualities arise in you, do not become inflated with conceit, for you will fall prey to Mara.“While residing in places on the limits of town, ensure that you your­self are pacified and tamed. Be modest in desires and learn to be content. Do not focus on your own [good] qualities or seek out others’ shortcom­ings. Do not be afraid and apprehensive. Do not have too many precon­ceptions. Cultivate a good heart. Do not be distracted by misguided ways, but contemplate the Dharma on a regular basis. Adopt humility; accept losses; give up trumpeting [your good deeds]; let go of deep desires; culti­vate affection; and have moderation in all things. You should be someone who is easy to please and easy to nurture. Run away from the worldly like a wild animal.“If you do not relinquish mundane norms, you are not a Dharma prac­titioner. If you do not relinquish the four pursuits, such as farming, you are not a monk. If you do not discard sensual objects, you are not a fully ordained monk. If you lack loving-kindness and the awakening mind you are not a bodhisattva. If you do not let go of [mundane] pursuits, you are not a meditating yogi.“Do not become a servant to sensual desires. In brief, while residing in the wilderness, ensure that you have few chores and that you undertake only the practice of the Dharma. In this way, ensure that when death approaches you will have no regrets.”Again Atisa said:Now, in this age of degeneration, is not the time for bravado; it is the time to expose the bones of your heart.51’Now is not the time to claim the high ground; it is the time to take the ground of humility."},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"570 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mNow is not the time to seek retinues and servants; it is the time to seek solitude.Now is not the time to measure your students; it is the time to measure yourself.Now is not the time to cling onto words; it is the time to contemplate their meanings.Now is not the time to travel around; it is the time to remain setded in one place.II. The Sayings ofDromtönpaThe three brothers520 who were the disciples of the spiritual mentor Drom- tönpa requested of him a method to condense the [essential] points of all the aspects of the path to omniscience.Dromtönpa stated: “For an individual practitioner to attain the bud- dhahood of omniscience, [364] inconceivable numbers of precepts can be the entries to the path. As for what is to be cultivated within, however, there is only one thing. What is this single point? It is emptiness endowed with the essence of compassion.“To distinguish its [aspects] further, empty refers to the ultimate awak­ening mind; it is the ultimate mode of being of all phenomena realized as primordially unborn. Compassion is the conventional awakening mind, which is the generation of great compassion toward those sentient beings who have failed to realize this [unborn nature]. Therefore, Mahayana prac­titioners for whom [the two awakening minds] have not yet arisen should first strive to generate the two awakening minds. In the middle, while train­ing in the two awakening minds that have already arisen in their mental conunuums, they gain certainty they will actualize their ultimate results— the Buddhas truth body and form body.“Although there are many methods for generating the awakening mind where it has not yet arisen, when summarized for practice, there are only three root methods and nine principal divisions. First the three roots are subsumed into (1) training the mind, (2) gathering the accumulations, and (3) seeking the meditative absorptions.“Their nine principal divisions, which are their branches, are [as fol­lows]: First, although there exist numerous methods for training the mind, the three principal ones are: (1) meditation on impermanence, (2) cultiva­tion of loving-kindness and compassion, and (3) meditation on the two"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 571selflessnesses. Among the methods for training the mind, thçse three are the greatest and, moreover, all other methods are encompassed by these three.“Although there are numerous methods of gathering the accumula­tions, the three principal ones are: (1) making offerings of material things and service to the teachers, (2) making offerings to the Three Jewels, and (3) making offerings of material things and service to the spiritual com­munity. Among the methods of accumulating merit, these three are the greatest and they also encompass [all other methods].“Although there are numerous ways of seeking meditative absorptions, the three principal ones are: (1) observing pure ethical discipline, (2) mak­ing supplications to the lineage teachers, and (3) seeking both physical and mental solitude. These three alone are the greatest, and they embody the methods of seeking the meditative absorptions of tranquil abiding and penetrative insight.“Thus, as a result of practicing these nine points in a concentrated man­ner, the two awakening minds arise in your mental continuum with the force of spontaneity. The moment the ultimate awakening mind arises, the realization of all external and internal phenomena as free of dualistic elaborations— as empty and unborn—will spontaneously arise [as well]. At that time, one will have found within oneself a joyful state of mind. [365] The moment the conventional awakening mind arises, feelings of loving-kindness and compassion toward the sentient beings who hjve failed to recognize this [truth of emptiness] will arise especially. Your sole task in life will become working for the welfare of sentient beings. At that point, whatever activities you engage in will become beneficial to other sentient beings.“You will thus combine these two [awakening minds] into a union so that at the very moment [when the realization of] emptiness [is present], compassion for sentient beings will grow especially, while at the very moment of compassion, you will not observe a substantial reality of one­self and [other] sentient beings. Thus, by recognizing [all] appearances as empcy and like illusions, when these two [minds] arise in union, you have entered the unmistaken path of the Great Vehicle. As you become trained in this [union], and when your habituation to this becomes perfected, you will attain the perfect dharmakaya and the perfect form body. From the ultimate awakening mind you attain the dharmakaya, while from the con­ventional awakening mind— i.e., compassion—you attain the form body."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"572- T h e B o o k o f K a d a mAnd, from the mastery of the indivisible union of these two, you attain the indivisible nature of the dharmakäya and form bodies.”* * HtAgain, the three brothers asked Dromtönpa, “Of the two— view and action—which is more important for the perfection of one’s own interests and others’ welfare?”Dromtönpa replied, “In order to perfect the welfare of self and others after entering the door of the Great Vehicle, you need to combine perfect view and perfect action. One in isolation [from the other] cannot accom­plish this [aim].”“If so, what constitutes perfect view and perfect action?” they asked.Dromtönpa responded: “ Perfect view refers to the recognition that all phenomena are, from the point of view of their ultimate nature, devoid of existing in any substantial mode of reality and free of all extremes of eter- nalism and nihilism, and the recognition that from the conventional per­spective, all external and internal phenomena are like dreams, illusions, and apparitions. You recognize them simply as expressions of your own mind, and you thus never place your trust in any thing or chase after any objects.“ Perfect action refers to respecting the law of karma and its effects, under­standing that on the dream-like, illusion-like level of conventional truth, the positive and negative karmas do not fail to give rise to their effects. Out of great compassion, you strive for the welfare of the sentient beings who fail to recognize this truth.“Such perfect view and perfect action arise naturally for someone in whom the two awakening minds have arisen.”“If this is so, what flaws arise when view and action are in isolation [from each other]?” they asked. [366]Dromtönpa replied, “If you do not respect the law of karma and its effects and let your behavior become degraded, you will be incapable of working for the welfare of both self and others, so your view will also become misguided. If you possess perfect action but fail to realize the ulti­mate mode of being [of all phenomena], you will be incapable of working for the welfare of both self and others, so your conduct will become mis­guided. Therefore, if you do not combine view and action, you will fall into error; it is necessary [therefore] to train in the union [of the two].”"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 573Again, the three brothers asked Dromtönpa, “Of the two— practicing in solitude and benefiting other sentient beings through teaching—which has a greater impact?”Dromtönpa replied: “If a beginner who does not have the slightest expe­rience of realization within his or her mental continuum were to help oth­ers through teachings, this would have no benefit. This is like pouring blessings from an empty container: there are no blessings to pour out. The essential instructions [of such a teacher] would be like beer made of grains that have not been well covered: there is no taste and vitality to such essen­tial instructions.“A person who has attained the [stage of] ‘heat’” 1 but not its stability will not be able to bring about the welfare of other sentient beings, for this is like pouring blessings from a full container, when the other [container] becomes full, it itself becomes empty. The essential instructions of such a person would be like passing a torch from one hand to another: when the other [hand] is illuminated, one’s own becomes darkened.“Once one has attained the bodhisattva levels, one should, as much as possible, engage in the activities of bringing about the welfare of sentient beings. Here the blessings are like the higher attainments flowing from an excellent vase: even when all others are enhanced, it never becomes empty. The essential instructions of such a person resemble a source lamp: even when all other [lamps] are lighted, it itself does not become obscured.“Therefore, during this age of degeneration, for ordinary beings, it is the time to familiarize your mind with loving-kindness and compassion in soli­tude. This is not the time to actually benefit sentient beings. It is the time to guard against the afflictions within your mind. This is analogous to the period when it is more appropriate to guard the fledgling shoot of a medic­inal tree than to cut it.”* * *Once a teacher from Kham asked Dromtönpa about the meaning of the two selflessnesses.Dromtönpa replied, “If you were to probe with your mind and search from the top of your crown aperture to the bottom of the soles of your feet, [367] not a single entity is to be found that is called the ‘self.’ That nonfind­ing is the selflessness of persons. Recognizing that the searching mind, too, is devoid of intrinsic existence is the selflessness of phenomena.”"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"574 T h e B o o k o fK a d a m» * *A woman named Salo Tsomo of Drom from the Tré522 region of Phenpo made an offering of forty bags of barley [to Dromtönpa] and asked the fol­lowing question: “My brother Dromtsik sent me to give you a message, O spiritual mentor. All the monks here have gathered for the purpose of attaining the omniscient state of buddhahood. We two siblings seek the same attainment. Spiritual mentor, since you possess the essential instruc­tions of Master Atis'a, the sole lord, as if poured from one full vase into another, today we request that you confer on us, keeping nothing hidden, the essential instructions for the attainment of buddhahood.”The spiritual mentorTönpa replied, “First contemplate extensively death and impermanence and the law of karma and its effects, and ensure the purity of all the vows that you have pledged to observe. Cultivate loving­kindness and compassion extensively and stabilize the awakening mind. To this end, gather the two accumulations by means of various methods. Purify negative karmas through various means. While maintaining the non-objectification of the three spheres with regard to all phenomena, dedicate all your roots of virtue toward the attainment of full enlighten­ment by all sentient beings. If you conduct yourself in this way, you need feel no sorrow for not having met Atisa. There is no greater teachings than this for becoming fully awakened. In the future one need not feel saddened for not meeting me, the old man of Drom, for there is no greater teachings than this.”* * *Once an upisaka asked the spiritual mentor Dromtönpa, “If one remains undivorced from loving-kindness, compassion, and the awakening mind, is this not, directly or indirectly, always the cause for the fulfillment of oth­ers’ welfare?”Dromtönpa replied: “Without question, this is the cause for the per­fect realization of others’ welfare; this will become the cause for the perfect realization of your own welfare as well, for if you remain undivorced from loving-kindness, compassion, and the awakening mind, it is impossible to be reborn in the three lower realms of existence. Starting right now you can become an ‘irreversible’ person. If, however, due to past grave negative kar­mas and powerful adverse current conditions, you were to take birth in the lower realms, [368] a mere single instance of recollecting loving-kindness, compassion, and the awakening mind would, that very instant, free you"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 575from that lower-realm birth. You would be certain to achieve the status of the extraordinary form of a human or celestial existence. For example, the G uide to the Bodhisattva’s Way o f L ife states:Whatever suffering is in the world Arises from wishing for one’s own happiness;Whatever happiness is in the world Arises from the wish for others’ happiness.What need is there to say more?The childish pursue their own interests,While the buddhas act for the welfare of others;Observe the difference between these two.525“Therefore, loving-kindness, compassion, and the awakening mind are the causes for accomplishing the great purposes of both self and others, it has been taught.”* * *Again, once at Radreng,524 an elder was circumambulating the outer peri­meter. Dromtönpa asked him, “O elder, performing circumambulation may be satisfying, but wouldn’t it be better if you practiced the Dharma?” The elder felt that, compared to performing circumambulations, per­haps it would be more effective if he were to read the Mahayana sutras, so he [sat down to] read the sutras on the temple’s veranda. Dromtönpa told him, “Reading the sutras might also be satisfying, but wouldn’t it be better if you practiced the Dharma?”Thus, [the elder] took this as a signal indicating that, compared to read­ing the sutras, engaging in meditative absorptions is more profitable, so he abandoned reading the sutras and sat down with his eyes closed. Again, Dromtönpa said, “Meditating might also be satisfying, but wouldn’t it bet­ter to practice the Dharma instead?”After failing to find any other method, [the elder] asked, “O spiritual mentor, if this is so, what kind of Dharma practice should I undertake?” “O elder, give up [attachment to] this life; give up [attachment to] this life,” replied Drom, it is said.In this way, Dromtönpa stated that, so long as we fail to forsake attach­ment to this life, whatever [practice] we undertake does not become"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"576 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mDharma practice, for such an act will remain within the bounds of the eight mundane concerns. By contrast, if we let go of attachment to this life, we will remain untainted by the eight mundane concerns, and [only] then will whatever we do become a path to liberation.* * *Once Potowa asked the spiritual mentor Dromtönpa, “Where is the line between Dharma and non-Dharma?”Dromtönpa replied, “If it is a remedy against the afflictions, it is Dharma; if not, it is not Dharma. If it is at variance with all worldly peo­ple, it is Dharma; if it is in accord [with the worldly], it is not Dharma. If its trace is positive, it is Dharma [369]; if not, it is not Dharma.”III. Sayings o f Other Masters ofKadamThe spiritual mentor Gönpawa525 said:The root of omniscience lies in the two accumulations.The root of the two accumulations lies in the awakening mind.The root of the awakening mind lies in loving-kindness and compassion.The root of the precepts of all of these [practices] lies in the six perfections.The root of giving lies in the absence of grasping attachment.The root of ethical discipline lies in reliance on good companions. The root of forbearance lies in upholding humility.The root of joyful perseverance lies in contemplating death.The root of concentration lies in seeking solitude.The root of wisdom lies in observing your own mind.The root of blessings lies in admiration and respect.The root of higher attainments lies in the vows and commitments. The root of higher qualities lies in learning, reflection, and meditation.The root of others’ welfare lies in the absence of selfish desires.And the root of both self and others’ welfare lies in meditative practice."},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 577Yerpa Shangtsiinpa”6 said: “If we aspire from the depths of our heart for liberation, we must, while continually contemplating death and imperma­nence, abide in the four natural attributes of a noble one in both our thoughts and actions.“The four natural attributes of a noble one are: (1) being content with modest clothing, (2) being content with modest food, (3) being content with modest bedding, and (4) being content with modest facilities for sub­sistence, such as medicine for illness. Alternatively, they are: (x) being mod­est in one’s desires, (2) having the ability to be content, (3) being easy to nurture, and (4) being easy to fulfill.“ Being modest in one’s desires refers to not having a deep desire for good facilities and for abundance, and to giving up all material possessions. H av­ing the ability to be content refers to being content with few and modest material things. Being easy to nurture refers to [370] being able to subsist on modest clothing, bedding, and food. Being easy to fu lfill refers to being satisfied with minimal and modest offerings, material gifts, and services.“Since all the factors of enlightement reside in the mindstream of the per­son who abides in the four natural attributes of a noble one, they are knéwn as abiding with the four natural attributes of a noble one.’ As all negative karmas, which are the causes of cyclic existence and the lower realms of exis­tence, reside in the mindstreams of those who are motivated by the mundane desires of this life and who thus do not abide in the four natural attributes of a noble one, so they are known as ‘abiding with the natural attributes of Mara.’ Therefore, if we feil to relinquish desire in this life, we will fall prey to the power of desire in our future lives as well, so we must relinquish all mundane desires pertaining to this life and abide within the four natural attributes of a noble one. To relinquish mundane desires of this life, it is crit­ical to constandy meditate on impermanence, which is their antidote, for if you feil to meditate on impermanence one morning, by midday you will be someone who is concerned with the mundane affairs of this life.”* * *Again, Yerpa Shangtsiin said: “If you aspire to attain omniscient buddha- hood, you need the three untainted factors: (1) your virtues must not be tainted by mundane conceptions pertaining to this life; (2) your actions of body and speech must not be tainted by the afflictions; and (3) your meditative practice must not be tainted by [the mindset of] the self- enlightened ones. In brief, your action must [illustrate] perfect realization."},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"578 T h e B o o k o f K a d a m“What is the measure of a perfect realization? It is flexible when it should be, so it must be flexible in terms of the view. It is strict when it should be, so it must be strict in terms of conduct. It is heroic when it should be, so it must be heroic in applying the antidotes against the afflictions. It is hum­ble when it should be, so through the achievement of forbearance, it must be humble when provoked by others and so on.”* * *Once the spiritual mentor Potowa527 was asked by an upâsaka, “To engage in a single-pointed practice of Dharma, what is most important?”Potowa replied: “To engage in a single-pointed practice of Dharma, the contemplation on impermanence is most important. For if you contem­plate death and impermanence, in the beginning it will cause you to enter the Dharma. In the middle, it will act as an impetus to engage in virtuous actions. Finally, it will act as a complement to realizing perfect equanimity of the ultimate nature of reality.“Again, if you contemplate impermanence, first [371] it will act as a cause for enabling you to let go of attachment to this life. In the middle, it will act as a condition for averting clinging to all aspects of cyclic exis­tence. Finally, it will act as a complementary factor for entering the path of nirvana.“Again, if you contemplate impermanence, and its realization arises in your mind, first it will act as a cause for cultivating faith. In the middle, it will inspire joyful perseverance. And finally, it will cause wisdom to arise.“Again, if you contemplate impermanence, and its realization arises in your mind, first it will act as a cause for inspiring armor-like joyous effort. In the middle, it will act as a condition to inspire the joyous effort of actual application. And finally, it will act as a complementary factor to inspire irreversible joyful perseverance.”* * *Once Kyangtsa Dortsiil528 asked the spiritual mentor Potowa for an instruc­tion. Potowa replied:“Contemplate impermanence repeatedly, and when the thought that death is inevitable arises, you will arrive at a point where there will be no hardship in abandoning negative karma and engaging in virtue.“In addition, repeatedly cultivate loving-kindness and compassion, and when they arise in your mental continuum, you will arrive at a point where"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 579there will no longer be any hardship in working for the welfare of sentient beings.“In addition, repeatedly meditate on emptiness, which is the ultimate mode of being of all phenomena. And when this [realization] arises in your mental continuum, you will arrive a point where there will no longer be any hardship in eliminating the delusions.”* * *Again, Potowa gave the following teaching to his assembly of disciples in general:“In general, the blessed Buddha, taking into account the existence of eighty-four thousand classes of sentient beings or categories of afflictions, taught as antidotes to these, eighty-four heaps of teachings. All of these, when condensed in words, are embodied in the three precious baskets of scripture. In terms of their subject matter, they are embodied in the three precious higher trainings.“Of the three precious higher trainings, first, it is on the basis of the higher training in morality that the higher training in meditation arises. On the basis of [the higher training in meditation], the higher training in wisdom arises. This, then, eradicates the afflictions from their roots, thus leading to full awakening. Therefore, since the first of the three higher trainings, the higher training in morality, is the foundation of all, [372] those at the beginning stage must take morality as their principal practice.“Attachment is the factor that is contrary to morality; furthermore, attachment is the root of all afflictions, for it is on the basis of attachment that all afflictions arise. Through it, negative karma is accumulated and one wanders in cyclic existence. To eliminate attachment, its antidote— the meditation on foulness— is taught.“There are five different methods for this meditation on foulness.”’ I.I. First visualizing the object as one’s mother, as one’s child, or as a sister is as follows: when the image of an object of attachment, such as a woman, becomes manifest, if you experience lustful attachment for a woman older than yourself, cultivate the thought of her as being your mother. If you experience lustful attachment toward a woman who is equal to your age, cultivate the thought of her as being your sister. If you experience lustful attachment for a woman younger"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"580 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mthan you, cultivate the thought of her as being your daughter. By meditating in these ways, your lustful attachment will be averted.2. If, despite engaging in such meditations, your lustful attachment is not overcome, second, contemplating the effects o f having a sense o f shame and conscience is as follows: generate the thought, ‘If I enter­tain such improper thoughts in my mind, the buddhas and bodhi- sattvas, who posses the wisdom eyes of unobstructed sight, will come to know and see this. They will be displeased and I will not be pro­tected. If I engage in unbecoming conduct, the gods of earth and skies will proclaim this to others; in this life my infamy will spread everywhere. In future lives, too, I will depart to the lower realms.’ As you practice a sense of shame and conscience by recalling such thoughts at all stages, from beginning to end, attachment will cease.3. However, if, despite such meditations, your lustful attachment does not cease, third, there is visualizing the image o f [the object] as being fo u l and [bearing] a fo u l odor. The first part of this, meditating on its foulness simultaneously, is as follows: visualize the womans body530 as being a container of thirty-two foul substances and a city of eighty thousand classes of worms, just like the example of a dogs corpse infested with maggots, lying rotten in the summer.The gradual meditation is as follows: first, visualize the womans body as being discolored, then as festering, then as bloated, as cut up, as infested with worms, as gnawed, and finally, as a skeleton.531 Through these [visualizations], your attachment will cease. [373]4. However, if this also does not avert your attachment, fourth, medi­tating [on the object] as an enemy or a slayer is as follows: reflect, ‘This woman is my enemy, for she undermines the thoughts that are in accord with Dharma practice.532 She is the slayer of liberations life­line. She is the hailstorm destroying the harvest of positive karma. She is the thief that robs away all factors that lead to perfection. She is the demon that obstructs all roots of virtue. She is the prison guard that prevents me from escaping the suffering of cyclic existence. She is the troublemaker that gives impetus to all the afflictions. Like the furnace chamber of the hells, she is the source of all sufferings.’ As you med­itate on these certainly your lustful attachment will come to cease.5. Fifth, visualizing [the object] as the trick o f an illusion is as follows: [reflect,] ‘A magician, for example, tricks many people by conjuring numerous creatures, such as men, women, horses, and elephants,"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 581with most attractive appearances and features. Likewise, through their attachment and clinging to things, all of which are false, decep­tive, and devoid of intrinsic existence like such illusions, sentient beings undergo suffering in the cycle of existence. In particular, this false, deceptive body of a woman, which is of little benefit and a source of enormous faults, has deceived me uninterruptedly at all times in the past, and it will do so today.’ By meditating this way, your lustful attachment will come to cease.If, despite meditating through all these methods, you fail to overcome attachment, the märas have entered [your heart]. Therefore,- you must strive to receive some means for overcoming the märas from your teacher.”* * *Spiritual mentor Chengawa”3 gave the following teaching to the assembly of his disciples in general: “In general, if you were to condense all the teach­ings— all three scriptural baskets and the two vehicles— they would be embodied in the two: refraining from harming others and helping others. To put these two into practice, forbearance is critical, for without forbear­ance, you will retaliate against che harm that [others] inflict upon you, and when this happens, you do not turn away from causing harm. Without this [forbearance], there is no helping others, so to succeed in your Dharma practice, forbearance is essential.“There are four methods of practicing forbearance: (1) practicing it in the fashion of putting up a target for shooting arrows, (2) practicing it by means of [cultivating] loving-kindness and compassion, (3) practicing it in the fashion of a master and his pupil, [374] and (4) practicing it by means of [understanding] the nature of reality. I.I. First, practicing [forbearance] in the fashion o f putting up a target fo r shooting arrows, is as follows. If you don’t place a target, it cannot be hit by an arrow; it is only because the target has been hoisted that it can get hit by the arrow. In the same manner, if you had not hoisted the target through your past karma, the arrows of harm would not have hit it in this life, so the arisal of harm perpetrated by others is due to your accumulation of negative karma in your past lives. It is not appropriate, therefore, to become angry toward others. The Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way o f L ife states:"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"582. T h e B o o k o f K a d a rnSo if I do not wrong them,No one will wrong me in return.534Previously I, too, have caused such harm To other sentient beings;Therefore, this befalling of harm upon me—I who have harmed sentient beings— is just.535Not only that, even in terms of this life, you will reap the effects of having inflicted harm on others in the early part of your life in the later part of your life. Likewise, you will reap last year’s [harm] this year, last month’s harm this month, and yesterday’s [harm] today. Even in this very moment, if you post the target by [using] painful words toward others and by [engaging in] negative behavior, right away, the arrows of painful words and so on will fall upon you. Therefore, recognize that it is because you put up the target that the arrows of harm from others have befallen you. With such awareness, refrain from being angry toward others. This is what Chengawa taught.2. Practicing forbearance by means o f loving-kindness and compassion is as follows. If, for example, a lunatic were to harm someone, others who are sane would not challenge the insane person; rather, they would say, ‘poor thing, what a pity,’ and would not retaliate against him. In the same manner, [reflect that] those who perpetrate harm against you are deeply insane and possessed by demons with forceful afflic­tions. Thinking, ‘how tragic,’ cultivate compassion toward them. In a way, the lunatic who is possessed by a malevolent force is less insane and, therefore, the harm he inflicts is of a lesser degree, for he harms only someone’s body and life. As his insanity is confined to a few years, months, or few days, it is shorter in duration. In comparison, when a human being who possesses a ‘sane’ mind inflicts harm on animals, it is a graver insanity. Since he has been under the power of afflictions since beginningless cyclic existence until now, the duration [of his insanity] is longer. Because of his unrestrained indulgence in nonvirtue through his body, speech, and mind, which gives rise to the sufferings of the three lower realms, the impact of his harm is greater. [375] In contrast, having compassion instead is greater in terms of its effect, so cultivate loving-kindness"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te r s 583and compassion toward those who perpetrate harm toward you, and do not harbor anger toward them. The Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way o f L ife states:If, when they are under the power of the afflictions,They kill even their own dear selves,How could it be that at such times [when afflicted]They do not cause injury to others’ bodies?Thus, under the power of the afflictions,There are those who engage in such acts as killing themselves; Even if you feel no compassion,How could you be angry at them?53*3. Practicing forbearance in the fashion o f a master and his p u p ilis as fol­lows. If there were no preceptor to confer the precepts, for instance, there would be no vows, and if there were no master to give the teachings, there would be no knowledge [of the scriptures]. In the same manner, if you had no enemies to harm you, you would have no forbearance. Thus you should recognize others who threaten you with verbal abuse and so on as teachers who grant you the gift of for­bearance; and, practicing sympathetic joy and repaying the kind­ness, view yourself as a student seeking to learn forbearance, and do not be angry toward them.4. Practicing forbearance by means o f [understanding] the nature o f real­ity is as follows. On the ultimate level, all the factors— myself, who is the object of harm, the other, who is the agent of harm, and the act of harm itself—are emptiness, the ultimate nature of reality. All these perceptions, such as me being attacked, are the apparitions of a deluded mind and therefore resemble dreams and illusions. Thus it is inappropriate to be angry toward them. The Guide to the Bodhi- sattva’s Way o f L ife states:Thus with respect to these empty things,What can be obtained, what can be lost?What can be disliked, what can be liked?Who can be humiliated as well?537"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"584 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mOne does not remain angry toward a dream enemy after awaking from sleep and recognizing his lack of intrinsic existence. Likewise, the ene­mies of the present are, on the ultimate level, devoid of intrinsic exis­tence, just like a dream. So instead of being hateful toward them, you should practice forbearance.” This is what Chengawa taught.* * *Again, the spiritual mentor Chengawa said: “To attain liberation and omniscience you must train in a practice that is at variance with all worldly people. For instance, the worldly cherish the buddhas more than sentient beings; they cherish themselves more than others; [376] they cherish those who help them more than those who cause them harm; and they cherish pleasure more than hardship.“Given that we must act in a reverse manner, we must cherish sentient beings more than the buddhas. Why? Because toward the buddhas, [nor­mally] not even the slightest disrespect will arise. There are [in contrast] four reasons why we must cherish sentient beings. (1) We must cherish them on the grounds that all beings of cyclic existence are our parents; (2) since our parents are suffering in cyclic existence, we must cherish them by offering our help; (3) we must cherish sentient beings on the grounds that by helping them our own welfare will be secured as a by-product; and (4) we must cherish them on the grounds that by helping sentient beings we make offerings to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas and please them.“Also, worldly people cherish themselves more than others. We, on the other hand, must cherish others more than ourselves. Why? Since begin­ningless time, we ourselves have caused our own sufferings; nobody else has made us suffer. We say at present that it is the afflictions that cause us to suffer; yet between afflictions and self there is no real duality, so self is the enemy that has made us suffer in cyclic existence since beginningless time. It is necessary, therefore, to inflict as much damage as possible upon this enemy. As for others, we must cherish them. Why? Since it is in relation to other sentient beings that we accumulate merit, all the happiness in the world arises from them; thus we must cherish them. Since it is on the basis of sentient beings that we can cultivate the two awakening minds, it is from them that all higher qualities of nirvana come into being. We must, there­fore, cherish sentient beings.“Worldly people cherish those who help them more than those who cause them harm. We, on the other hand, must do the opposite. Why? In"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f the K a d a m M a s te rs 585worldly terms one’s parents are the greatest source of benefit. Parents give their children an estate, land, a house, gold, turquoise, horses, cattle, a wife, servants, and so on. From the point of view of Dharma practice, however, there is nothing more harmful than this, for on the basis of hav­ing been given these objects of attachment, karma and afflictions increase tremendously, [377] thus leading to their accumulation, and this eventu­ally becomes a factor for casting one to the hells. Although one’s parents of this life may seem beneficial in the present, since they ultimately lead one to suffering, [in one sense] there is no greater enemy.538 Therefore, we must cherish those who cause us harm more than those who bring us benefit. Why? Due to the enemy’s infliction of harm, we cultivate for­bearance and thus obtain immeasurable merit. Because of our enemy’s harm, we step up our efforts and traverse higher and higher levels. We thus achieve all higher attainments, so we must cherish those who inflict harm upon us.“Worldly people cherish pleasure more than hardship. We, on the other hand, must do the opposite and cherish hardship more than pleasure. Why? [Worldly people] are attached to the pleasures of going to bed, sleep­ing, sex, laziness, clothes, and food, and these all cause suffering. We, on the other hand, must cherish hardship because, through the pains involved in serving teachers and members of the Sangha, performing ascetic prac­tices of ethical discipline, and engaging in virtuous activities, our accumu­lations will be completed and obscurations purified. We will thereby attain the state of great bliss.” Therefore, [Chengawa] said that we must cherish [hardship]. He said that since it is on the basis of physical illness and men­tal pain that one experiences disenchantment toward cyclic existence and generates true renunciation, we must cherish hardship.Therefore, according to [Chengawa], if you possess these four practices that are at variance with the worldly, then, like the accurate divination of an oracle, you need not do anything else. If you lack these four, then, like a bad fortune teller, nothing you do will be of any benefit.* * *Again, the spiritual mentor Chengawa said: “At present, even the Dharma practices of the best practitioners are mixed with [the concerns of] this life.First, fearing weakness, one latches on to the coattails of every group.Fearing abduction by ghosts, one does retreats on wrathful deities."},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"586 T h e B o o k o fK a d a mFearing starvation in some future life, one hoards possessions.Fearing ill repute, one adopts all kinds of affected behavior.“You may wish to attain buddhahood amid such [pursuits], but it can­not happen. It is as if you want from the same sheep both a bag for carry­ing water [378] and a sheepskin that can barely be lifted. It is not possible.“If so, how should you act? We practice forbearance instead of retalia­tion when someone harms us, and so a person with a harsh mouth cannot torment us. Since the principal [response to] a harsh mouth is the practice of forbearance, you need not latch on to a group,” Chengawa said.“If enemies and obstacles seek opportunities [to harm] us, we recognize the self to be nonexistent even on the conventional level, like the horns of a rabbit. And since we have already given away our body to the ghosts, even the gods and demons of the trichilicosm cannot harm it. Foremost among counterforces is the realization of no-self; hence you need not undertake mantra recitation of wrathful deities.“Although we may have no possessions and provisions, we commit the core of our mind to Dharma practice, commit the core of our Dharma practice to [the life of] a beggar, and commit the end of this [life of a] beg­gar to death. Therefore, all those with faith honor us. Foremost among pos­sessions is the absence of attachment; hence you need not hoard material things.“If others disparage us, since we have ensured our minds to be free of pretension, we will become, in the end, an object of admiration by all. Therefore, since the basis of fame and renown is flawless thoughts and behavior, there is no need at all to adopt pretentious behavior [anyway],” said Chengawa.* * *Again, the spiritual mentor Chengawa said: “In general, it is on the basis of [grasping at] the self-existence of persons and the self-existence of phe­nomena that all the afflictions and distorted thoughts proliferate. In par­ticular, for us, it is the [grasping at] the self-existence of persons alone that causes harm. Therefore, it is the self-existence of persons that is to be attacked and eliminated through the three [levels of] wisdom— the under­standing derived from learning, from reflection, and from meditation. However, in our case, even while engaged in learning, reflection, and med­itation, our [grasping at] self expands, the strength of our forbearance is"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f th e K a d a m M a s te rs 587weaker than a deer calf, and our temperament is more edgy than the ghost of Tsang.53’ These are signs that our understandings derived from learning, reflection, and meditation have gone wrong. If we view external appear­ances as somewhat empty, yet our inner self remains intact, without even a scratch, this is like shooting an arrow far away when the target is directly in front of us. This is like searching for the footprints of a thief in the meadow when he ran to the forest, or sending ritual torma to the northern gate while the ghost is at the eastern gate.”* * *Spiritual mentor Phuchungwa540 said: “We have obtained this utterly frag­ile human existence of leisure and opportunity. [379] Although we have obtained this, we don’t have the power to stay long, for we must [all] die. At the time of death, we have'no power to retain all the mundane thoughts regarding this life and the mundane beauties, not even a fallen petal of a flower. Nothing can accompany us. At that time everything will be revealed starkly, the level of our intelligence, the strength or weakness of our abil­ity, and our skiilfulness or its lack in the pursuit of our goals.“If, at the time of death, one can remain joyful and rest in a warm glow, then the level of one’s intelligence is high, one’s ability is strong, and one’s pursuit of goals is skillful. Such a person is called ‘competent.’ But if, at that time, vivid visions of Yama’s form and the aspects of the lower realms appear, one has not been skilled in the pursuit of goals and has thus failed to be competent. In the case of most of us, many travel mistaken paths because of continual reinforcement of the planning for'this life.“It is impossible that the fully awakened perfect Buddha would speak falsehood. It is also impossible that the [great] authors of the treatises, such as Master Nâgârjuna, would speak falsely. It is also impossible for the sub­lime teachers to speak falsely, so the question is, ‘Who then puts us on the wrong paths?’ It is our desires pertaining to this life that have led us to the wrong paths, so we should constantly contemplate death and, by recalling death, ensure we never remain attached to our selfish interests. We should meditate on the defects of cyclic existence in its entirety and, by bringing disenchantment to mind, ensure we never become attached to any part of cyclic existence. We should meditate on emptiness— the ultimate mode of being of all things— and, by recalling no-self, ensure we never become attached to things and their signs.”"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"588 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mAgain, the spiritual mentor Phuchungwa said: “If you are practicing Dharma seriously, you should be like a writing board with holes in it. Just as a writing board with holes cannot be used for inscribing taxes, you should be someone who cannot remain together with those who are con­cerned only with this life.541 Excessive befriending and appeasing of others will lead you to be abducted by the miras, so not appeasing others is some­thing to be desired. Because he is not pleased, he does not come; and because he disparages you, others do not come either. In such situations, though you may have only a single shogang coin542 for your provisions, while it lasts, your mental state will remain joyful and you will be able to engage in virtuous activities. When virtuous activities increase, higher qualities come about naturally. Then; even the welfare of others will come about spontaneously.” [380]* * *Again, the spiritual mentor Phuchungwa said:Greater is the bliss of eliminating sensual desires than the bliss of indulging them.Greater it is to know a single meaning than to know many words.Greater are the benefits of giving teachings than the benefits of giving many material things.Greater is the fear of the suffering of future lives than the fear of this life’s sufferings.Greater it is to resolve doubts within one’s mind than doubts about outer meanings of words.* * *Spiritual mentor Nyukrumpa543 said:Those who wish for [birth in] higher realms and the definite goodness of enlightenment should cultivate the recognition of cyclic existence as a prison.They should cultivate the recognition of their body and life as bubbles in water.They should cultivate the recognition of evil friends as an enemy’s henchmen."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"S a y in g s o f the K a d a m M a s te rs 589They should cultivate the recognition of their teachers as wish­granting jewels.They should cultivate the recognition of afflictions as venomous snakes.They should cultivate the recognition of negative karma as deadly poison.They should cultivate the recognition of sensual objects as fire buried in ashes.They should cultivate the recognition of fame and renown as echoes.They should cultivate the recognition of gifts and honor as snares or nets.They should cultivate the recognition of evil friends as a plague.They should cultivate the recognition of positive friends as a fortress.They should cultivate the recognition of all sentient beings as fathers and mothers.They should cultivate the recognition of giving as a wish-granting cow.5^They should cultivate the recognition of morality as a precious ornament.They should cultivate the recognition of forbearance as an excellent armor.They should cultivate the recognition of joyous effort as a heavenly horse.They should cultivate the recognition of concentration as a great treasure [vase].They should cultivate the recognition of wisdom derived through learning, reflection, and meditation as a lamp.* * *Spiritual mentor Khamlungpa545 said:Since it is extremely hard to obtain a human existence of leisure and opportunity, guard morality as you would protect your own eyes.Since there is no knowing when this illusory aggregation might come to an end, strive in spiritual activities through body and speech."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"590 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mSince ail conditioned positive karmas are [ultimately, insignificant and] neutral, make extensive aspiration for the benefit of the sentient beings.

For even if we were to achieve all three—joy, happiness, and fame— in this life, if our thoughts are not turned toward the Dharma, these will ail be tricksters. Swifdy we must shun them so that we have no connections with them. They are to be discarded one day anyway, so if we let go of them today, it will be worthwhile.“Even if we are renowned as a learned one, a disciplined one, a teacher, and a meditator, if we fail to give up [attachment to] this life, we will pur­sue only the means for achieving greatness in this life. In this way, we will need to cover the entire earth with our restless pursuits, and through this, naturally and forcibly, we will become saturated with negative karma, increasingly at odds with the Dharma. Continuing to think ‘I will not die,’ we will die with clinging and attachment, with the chores of this life left unfinished. For us there is nowhere to go but to the lower realms. If, on the other hand, the [realization of] death and impermanence has arisen in our minds and we have forsaken [attachment to] this life, we may not have been renowned in the past as a learned one or as a disciplined one, but we will accomplish all the aims without others’ being aware of it. Such a per­son, no matter when he dies, because of having made exclusive prepara­tions for death, will be able to die happily and joyfully, free of any attachment or clinging to something. [383]“Therefore, our approach should be like this.

If they turn out to be mixed with [the mundane aims of] this life, they have become mixed with the afflictions, so relinquish all the afflictions and negative karma [falsely] construed as Dharma practices. To relinquish these, persistendy and repeatedly apply the vigilance of mindfulness, the observation of intro­spective awareness, and the restraint of heedfulness.

For this, we need to forsake [attachment to] this life. To attain lib­eration we must avert our thoughts from every part of cyclic existence. [386] To plant the feet of omniscience we must train in the awakening mind within our mental continuums.“To generate these three thoughts, we must accumulate merit, for with­out gathering the merit, we will not be able to understand the teachings. Even if we do understand the teachings in some instances, their realization will not grow in us. Even if some fragmented realizations grow in us, they will evaporate and will be of no benefit. Therefore, the reason we wandered in cyclic existence in the past was because of our failure to accumulate merit and our collecting of demerit. Even in this life, our failure to have things as we wish is due to our failure to accumulate merit and to eradicate neg­ative, nonvirtuous karmas from their roots. Thus, the root of all teachings can be subsumed into the following two— accumulating merit and1 purify­ing negative karma.”* * *Again Shawopa said: “As for us, the desires of this life are what bring the sufferings of this and future lives, so we should shun the things that attach­ment to this mundane life craves. When the objectives of this life’s desire are extensive, our mind lacks peace; we wander everywhere, and in the course of this, all three factors— negative karma, suffering, and ill fame— strike simultaneously. We must, therefore, relinquish this multipronged mind of desire. When we succeed in turning away the mind of desire, that is when joy and happiness starts.We seek happiness in this and throughout all lives, and so, as a sign of this, neither crave for anything in your heart nor hoard anything.When you do not crave for gifts, this is the best gift.When you do not crave for praise, this is the best praise."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"598 T h e B o o k o f K a d a mWhen you do not crave for fame, this is the best fame.When you do not crave for retinues, this is the best retinue.“If you would practice the Dharma from your heart, point the tip of your mind to [the life of] a beggar.

In brief, if on our part, we initiate all kinds of endeavors, know all sorts of things, engage in all kinds of deeds, and how­ever much we might say, [387] as long as our thoughts are not turned away from the desires of this life, we have no means of gaining the happiness of both this and future lives.

This historian of Kadam fuses the stages of the path and the stages of doctrine teachings together and identifies what he calls the “three line­ages of lamrim.” They are: (1) the lamrim lineage stemming through Potowa, (2) the lineage stemming through Chengawa, and (3) the lineage stemming through Sangphuwa (i.e., Ngok Lekpai Sherap).12 Selected extracts from these early stages of the doctrine texts can be found in Yeshé Döndrup, Treasury o f Gems, pp. 106-28,136—45.13 See my introduction in M in d Training: T he G reat Collection, volume 1 of The L ib ra ry o f Tibetan Classics. The fifteenth-century historian Sönam Lhai Wangpo (A H istory o f the Precious K adam Tradition, p. 383) refers to the mind training teachings as \"scattered sayings” (gsungsgros thor bu).14 There is no consensus on Sarahas dates among contemporary scholars, and the Tibetan sources provide conflicting evidence.

The Tibetan tradi­tion also identifies a collection known as “Atis'a's Cycle of One Hundred Short Texts” (Jo bo’i chos chung brgya rtsa), although it is not clear who first compiled the collection.16 Gö Lotsäwa Shönu Pal, The B lu e A n n als, vol.

Thuken Chökyi Nyima ( C r y s t a lM ir ­ror o f P h ilo so p h ica l Systems, p. 101) writes that, although essential instructions (gdam s ngag) and oral instructions (m an ngag) may generally be seen as synony­mous, in the context of identifying the distinct transmission lineage of Kadam teachings, “oral instructions” refers specifically to the secret teachings of The Book o f K adam .22 This is according to Thuken Chökyi Nyima (Crystal M irro r, p. 100). However, Tsalpa Künga Dorjé ( The R e d A n n a ls, p. 65) identifies Naktso Lotsäwa (1011-64) as the source of the Kadam lineage of the stages of the path.23 Sönam Lhai Wangpo, A H istory o f the Precious K adam Tradition, p. 372.24 Gö Lotsäwa Shönu Pal, T he B lu e A n n als, vol.

Lechen Künga Gyaltsen {L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition, p. 2a:2) also briefly mentions this tradition of identifying the three Kadam broth­ers with the three Avalokites'vara icons in Tibet that are traditionally believed to be self-arisen, that is they arose naturally as icons rather than being fabricated by artists.44 In the testament, Atiia visits Lhasa cathedral with his attendant Naljorpa and does not mention Dromtonpa by name. Leonard van der Kuijp (“The Dalai Lamas and the Origins of Reincarnate Lamas,” p. 24) argues that since the testament does not mention Dromtonpa, it may have evolved in an environment where Dromtön and the tradition growing out of his teachings initially had no stake. This suggests,"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"Ó22 N o te s to p a g e s 2 0 - 2 2according to van der Kuijp, that the nineteenth chapter of Dromtönpa’s birth sto­ries can be seen as a means to establish Songtsen Gampo as one of Dromtön’s pre­vious births. Whatever the truth of this suggestion— which can only be determined once we have accurate dates for the two texts— the two texts arc clearly intimately connected.45 The Kakhotma Testament, p. 319. This testament, as well as The Book o fK a d a m , especially chapters 5 and 19 of the Son Teachings, need to be studied carefully alongside another important treasure text, the Sa cred Collection on M a n i /M an tra) (M a n i bka’ 'bum), the discovery or revelation of which is traditionally attributed to Nyangral Nyima Oser (1124-92). Together, these texts appeared to have played a key role in propagating many aspects of the myth of Avalokitesvara and his spe­cial destiny with Tibet, beliefs that became deeply ingrained and widespread among the Tibetan people. My own feeling is that the K akholm a Testament, at least in its archaic form, predates both The Book o fK a d a m as well as the Sa cred Collec­tion on M a n i. In feet, the two latter texts represent subsequent attempts to con­nect the myth of Avalokitesvara’s special role in Tibet with two important figures in the development of Buddhism in Tibet— the first with Dromtonpa and the sec­ond with Padmasambhava. For a brief yet insightful study of the S a cre d Collection on M a n i, see Mathew Kapstein, “Remarks on the Mani bka’ ’bum and the Cult of Avalokitesvara in Tibet,” in Steven D. Goodman and Ronald M. Davidson, eds., Tibetan B u d d h ism : Reason a n d Revelation, pp. 79-93, as well as chapter 8 of his Tibetan A ssim ilation o f Buddhism .46 The distinction between main book and ancillary texts presented here is based on Sönam Lhai Wangpo’s A H istory o f the Precious K adam Tradition, pp. 379-80. Ehrhard discusses the division of The Book o fK a d a m into fifty-four sections (“The Transmission of the T h ig -le b c u -d ru g an d the Bk a 'gd am sg leg s b a m ,\" pp. 31-34 and 37_38). The overall structure of The Book o fK a d a m and the sequence in which the various texts are organized are analyzed in Amy Sims Miller’s doctoral dissertation, \"Jeweled Dialogues: The Role of T he Book in the Formation of the Kadam Tradi­tion within Tibet.”47 These two texts appear in M in d Training: The G reat Collection as selections 2 and 3.48 Hubert Decleer, in “Master Atis'a in Nepal,” presents a series of arguments that, to his mind, support the traditional attribution of this important historical text to Dromtonpa. For a critical analysis of these traditional biographies of Atis'a, see Helmut Eimer, “The Development of the Biographical Tradition Concerning Atis'a (Dipamkaras'rijñana).”49 Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsen, “Chapter on Auspiciousness,” The Book o f K adam , vol. II, p. 835.50 The term “archaic version” of The Book o fK a d a m was, as noted by Franz-Karl Ehrhard (“The Transmission of the T h ig -le bcu -d ru g and the B k a ' gdam s glegs b a m ,\" p. 31), first suggested by Helmut Eimer in “Zur Faksimile-Ausgabe eines alten Blockdruckes des Bka’ gdams glegs bam” in In d o -Ira n ia n Jo u r n a l 27, no. 11 (1984): 45 and 47-51 Franz-Karl Ehrhard refers to this early transmission as the “legendary transmission” and the subsequent transmission from Phuchungwa as the “local transmission.”52 Tapka Namkha Rinchen wrote a twenty-Ave-stanza salutation to the lineage mas­ters of T he Book o fK a d a m , which is cited in full at the beginning of Khenchen"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"N o te s to p a g e s 2 2 - 2 8 623Nyima Gyaltsens “Liberating Life Stories of the Lineage Teachers of the Seven­fold Divinity and Teaching.” See T h e Book o fK a d a m , vol. I, pp. 299—302. The dates 1214-86 were suggested for Namkha Rinchen by Franz-Karl Ehrhard (op cit., p. 43), who gives Khenchen’s “Liberating Life Stories” as his source. Judg­ing by Khenchen’s account in the “Liberating Life Stories” as well as by Lechen’s account of Namkha Rinchen, especially with respect to the manner in which he transmitted the teachings of the book to Drom Kumâramati, it seems that Namkha Rinchen died when Drom Kumâramati was young. If Namkha Rinchen had indeed lived until 1286, Khenchen, our compiler, would have met him and would have mentioned his meeting, but he does not. Therefore, whether the Fire-Dog year provided as the year of Namkha Rinchen’s death is not 1226 rather than 1286 is a question that can only be resolved with additional evidence.53 See Franz-Karl Ehrhard (op cit., p. 44), who cites Yongzin Yeshé Gyaltsens L ib e r­a tin g L ive s o f the Lineage Teachers o f La m rim , pp. 918—19. One possible way in which we can interpret this shift from a one-to-one direct transmission to a wider dissemination is as the beginnings of a written text. That there can be a highly suc­cessful transmission of oral texts of great length is attested by the early history of many of the Buddhist sutras, which were memorized, retained, and transmitted entirely orally for several generations, as well as the much-earlier transmission of the Vedas.54 Khenchen, “Liberating Life Stories,” T he Book o fK a d a m , vol.

Earlier, Khenchen also states that the details of Namkha Rinchen’s life, including the manner in which he received the transmission of the book, was based on an oral account that Drom Kumâramati heard from Namkha Rinchen himself (“Liberating Life Sto­ries,” p. 482).61 Ibid., p. 302.62 The R ite o f the M a n d a la , pp. iza:4-29b:i.63 Ibid., p.

Perhaps this short text is what Lechen Künga Gyaltsen (L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H is­tory o f the K adam Tradition, p. 4a:6) refers to as “Phuchungwas supplement to the book, the Sevenfold Divinities and Teachings of Kadam.”66 “Liberating Life Stories,” p. 351.67 L h a chos bdun Idan g y i man ngag.68 Yongzin Yeshé Gyaltsen, T he R ite o f the M an d a la , p. 28b:6.69 Jo y fu l Feast f o r the Learned, vol.

For example, we see the following comment in Yeshé Tsemo’s biography of Gendiin Drup (p. 4b:6): “Furthermore, there are many similar state­ments. Later, too, numerous indirect indications will come to light. As for the details, however, one needs to understand them from The Precious Book and The K in g ’s Testament.\"82 Desi Sangyé Gyatso, Yellow B e ry l: A H istory o f G anden Tradition, for example, p. 365. This project of equating the Great Fifth with Avalokites'vara, and with previ­ous successive emanations of the Buddha of Compassion, especially with figures like Dromtön and the previous Dalai Lamas, is extensively developed in Desi’s voluminous supplement to the Great Fifths autobiography, F in e Silk en Robe.83 The four divinities and three teachings, also known as the sevenfold d iv in itie s a n d teachings (lh a chos bdun Idan), later came to be a defining characteristic of the Kadam tradition. The seven refer to the Kadampa masters’ choice of four divini­ties— the historical Buddha as the teacher, Avalokites'vara as the divinity embody­ing great compassion, Tara as the divinity embodying enlightened activities, and Acala as the divinity guarding against all obstacles— and the three teachings— the three scriptural baskets of discipline, sutras, and higher knowledge. See the intro­duction for more on this subject.84 Dipamkarasrijñána is another name for Atis'a.85 The term conqueror, an epithet for a buddha, here refers to Atis'a. The phrase departure to liberation is a euphemism for his death."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 3 7 —5 1 62586 The four everyday activities are (1) walking toward a destination, (2) going for a stroll, (3) sleeping, and (4) sitting, as listed in the earliest Buddhist scriptures, espe­cially those relating to the monastic vows.87 Gyalwai Jungné (R g y a l ba t ‘byung gnas)— literally, “the source of the con­querors”— is Dromtonpa’s name.88 Whereas the verses previous to this line serve as a preliminary invoking of Atiia and a request for him to bear witness, the actual text of the self-exhortation begins from here. By calling out to the son of Dipamkaras'rijñána, the author Dromtönpa is referring to himself.89 “Extract the essence of this body” (lus la snying p o len p a ) is an expression that means to make the most of the rare opportunity to practice the Oharma as a human being, the type of rebirth that provides the ideal conditions for realization. The expression probably alludes to the analogy of extracting the juice or \"essence” of a fruit or extracting the grain out of its husk.90 “Four sessions” (thun b z h i) refers to engaging in sitting meditation practices dur­ing four formal periods during the day, one roughly from around 4 -7 A.M., sec­ond 8 -11 A.M., third 2-5 P.M., and finally 7 -10 P.M. These formal sitting sessions are observed during an intensive retreat context.91 The four immeasurable thoughts are (1) immeasurable compassion, (2) immeas­urable loving-kindness, (3) immeasurable joy, and (4) immeasurable equanimity.92 The Tibetan word translated here as “insects” is srin bu, which refers to bacteria­like organisms thought to be naturally present in the human body according to traditional Indian and Tibetan medical systems.93 The term corresponding causes refers to the idea that we reap what we sow. Accord­ing to the law of karma, our experiences in this life each correspond in character to the actions we performed in a past life to create them. For instance, a causally concordant effect of killing in a previous life would be a short lifespan in this life.94 This alludes to a well-known analogy in the early sutras. The Buddha tells the members of his order that just as the ocean never keeps a corpse but pushes it to the shore, in the same manner, monks disassociate from those who commit evil. Candrakirti also uses this analogy in M adhyam akävatära, 2:8.95 This is probably a reference to Nägärjuna, who is recognized as an emanation of the Buddha of wisdom, Mañjus'rl. Although I have failed to locate the source referred to here, the same analogy is used in M in d Training: The G rea t Collection, pp. 446-4 7, to characterize the precarious nature of our existence.96 The ten masteries are mastery of: (1) lifespan, (2) mind, (3) material resources, (4) karma, (5) birth, (6) convictions, (7) aspiration, (8) supernatural feats, (9) phe­nomena, and (10) gnosis. The bodhisattvas on advanced levels are said to gain these masteries.97 The critical Tibetan edition gives gse tshags here, which I think should be corrected to gseb tshags. Among other definitions, the Tibetan dictionaries give “seedless,” “in between,” and “cracks” as diverse meanings of gseb. I have chosen “seedless” since it connotes barrenness, which is the most appropriate meaning in the con­text here.98 This is a reference to the heart instructions of The Book o f K adam , whose main"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"6z6 Notes to pages Si—59meditation practice is related to the Buddha, Avalokites'vara, Tara, Master Atis'a, and Dromtonpa.99 These refer to Master Adía, the Buddha, the Perfection of Wisdom Mother, and the bodhisattvas.100 In T he Book o fK a d a m , the key elements of meditative practices are often referred to by the word drop (th ig le ), as in “the sixteen drops.”101 The following paragraph is somewhat obscure, especially its opening sentence “The sequence [of the practices] appears as follows” ( 'd i la’a n g ’brel ba byung tshul), which literally translates as “here, too, the sequence is this.” This paragraph is best read as a summary, probably inserted by the editor of The Book o f K adam , which brings together all the practices covered in Dromtönpa’s Self-E xho rtatio n . For con­venience, I have numbered the individual practices.102 “He” here refers to Dromtonpa, whose words are being cited once again in the verses that follow.103 This is a reference to the three Kadam brothers: Potowa, Chengawa, and Phuchungwa. For brief biographical information on these three Kadam brothers and other Kadam masters, see my annotations to Sayings o f the K adam Masters, entry XI in this volume.104 D u n gk a r Tibetological G reat D ictio n a ry (D u n g d k a r tshig m dzod chen m o) lists the following as the seven attributes: (i) excellent family, (2) physical beauty, (3) long life, (4) good health, (5) good fortune, (6) wealth, and (7) intelligence. Unfortu­nately, Dungkar provides no source for this enumeration.105 The “ten levels” are the ten levels of the bodhisattva while the “accumulation” and so on refers to the five stages of the path to enlightenment. They are, in their respective order: the path of accum ulation, the path of preparation, the path of see­ing, the path of meditation, and the path of no more learning.106 A “retention” (gzungs; Sanskrit, d h ä ran i) is a highly developed memory that is immune to forgetfulness. Four such retentions are listed among the Buddha’s enlightened attributes. “Absorptions” (ting \\'dzin; Sanskrit, sam ädh i) refers to a series of progressively more advanced meditative concentration states.107 This is a reference to the well-known Vows o f G o o d C o n du ct Sutra (Bh ad racaryä- p ra n id h ä n a, Toh 1095, Kangyur, gzungs bsdus, vam ), which is also part 4 of the F lo w e r O rnam ent Scripture (Avatam saka Sätra).108 This line is missing in the critical Tibetan edition, which is based on the Tashi Lhiinpo edition of T he Book o fK a d a m . Since it appears in the Dergé edition and, moreover, the reading of the text seems more complete with the addition of this line— coming immediately after the invocation of the auspiciousness of the noble Sangha and the sublime Dharma— I have chosen to include this line in the translation.109 The four factors are: (1) giving what is needed, (2) speaking pleasantly, (3) work­ing toward the aim, and (4) behaving consistently. Different texts give slightly different interpretations of the third and fourth factors and their relationship. A discussion of these four factors based on the important Mahayana sutra, the Bodh isattvapitaka, and Asañga’s Bodhisattvabhüm i can be found in Ulrich Pagel, The Bodhisattvapitaka: Its D octrines, Practices a n d T h e ir Position in M ah a ya n a L it ­erature, chap. 4.

The version found here is, how­ever, except for minor typographical variations, identical to the one found in M in d Training: The G reat Collection (volume 1 of T he L ib ra ry o f Tibetan Classics). The translation presented here is therefore the same, unless otherwise noted. The vari­ations in the readings between this version and that in the Dergé Tengyur are fully annotated in the critical Tibetan edition of the text. For those variations in read­ing that are significant, see my notes to the text in M in d Training.111 Given that this short work of Atis'a, Bodhisattva's Je w e l G arland, is used in T he Book o fK a d a m as the root text of the “Father Teachings,” I have introduced numbers in parenthesis at the beginning of each line where the root text of a new chapter of the “Father Teachings\" begins. This numbering is different from the stanza number introduced in my translation of the same text in M in d Training.1 12 In M in d Training: The G reat Collection, I have translated this line as “With mind­fulness, vigilance, and conscientiousness.” I now feel that “awareness” (or “meta­awareness\" to be more correct) and “heedfulness” are preferable, for the Tibetan terms shes bzhin and bag y o d113 “Faith” here refers to faith in the law of karma.114 The term khenpo (m khan p o ), translated here as \"preceptors,” often means an abbot of a monastery, but here the term refers to spiritual masters who have con­ferred vows upon you.113 In M in d T raining I translated this line as “Dispel hostility and unpleasantness.” Reading the text more carefully and, especially taking into account the fact that the English term unpleasantness connotes more the notion of being unpleasant to others, I feel that this line is better translated as “Discard hostile and unhappy mental states.” Since hostile and unhappy mental states undermine the conditions for a successful Dharma practice, the practitioner is urged to seek a place or a state of mind where happiness and joy dominate.116 In M in d T ra in in gI translated these two lines as, “When you encounter the factors of happiness,/ In these always persevere.”117 To better suit the text of chapter 18 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f D ialogues, I have trans­lated the first and last lines of the stanza more literally than in M in d Training.118 “Seven limbs” refers to a popular Mahayana Buddhist rite of worship that includes the following elements: (x) paying homage, (2) making offerings, (3) confessing and purifying negative karma, (4) rejoicing in the virtuous deeds, (5) supplicating the buddhas to turn the wheel of Dharma, (6) appealing to the buddhas not to enter into final nirvana, and (7) dedicating the merit of your practice. This prac­tice of seven limbs goes back to die earliest development of Mahayana Buddhism. It is found, for example, in the well-known sutra, Vows o f G ood C onduct (Bh adracaryäpranidhäna), which is part 4 of the F lo w e r O rnam ent Scripture (Avatam saka Sutra, Toh 44) and also self-standing in Toh 1095. The second chap­ter of Säntideva’s G u id e to the Bodhisattva’s Way ó f L ife (Bodhicaryávatára) also uses the seven limbs.119 The two defilements are the obscuration of afflictions and, once the afflictions have been removed, the subtle latent propensities toward afflictions, including all subtle dualistic delusory perceptions.120 Mount Pótala is the pure realm of Avalokites'vara, the buddha of compassion, and"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"should not be confused with the well-known Tibetan architectural wonder by the same name that was the winter residence of the Dalai Lamas.

The k in g -lik e awakening mind is the altruistic wish to first attain full enlightenment oneself so that one can then help relieve all beings from cyclic existence. By contrast, the oarsm an-like bodhisattva wishes that both he and others attain full enlightenment simultaneously, just as an oarsman crosses to the opposite shore together with his passengers. Finally, shepherd-like bodhi- sattvas aspire to lead all other beings to full enlightenment before themselves, like the shepherd who brings home his flock by herding them from behind.122 This is a standard division of a day and night in the classical Indian and Tibetan texts as conveyed in the expression “the six periods of day and night” (nyin tshan dus drug).123 There is a tradition of listing seven past buddhas: three buddhas of the previous eon and the four past buddhas of the present eon, with the historical Buddha áakyamuni being the last. Here, however, the reference is most probably to the seven buddhas of the Medicine Buddha mandala, who are believed to have a spe­cial connection with the beings of our degenerate era.124 Mañjus'rï, Vajrapäni, Avalokites'vara, Ksitigarbha, Sarvanivaranavisltamvin, Akâs'a- garbha, Maitreya, and Samantabhadra. These eight bodhisattvas figure promi­nently in the Mahayana sutras as the Buddhas principal bodhisattva disciples who are in celestial form.125 This is a reference to the second volume of The Book o fK a d a m , the tales of the former lives of Dromtönpa.126 This is a reference to the mythical Mount Meru, which stands towering at the cen­ter of the classical Indian world system, surrounded by four continents and eight subcontinents.127 An account of Atis'a’s meeting with this Vajrayana master is found in M in d Train­ing: The G reat Collection, pp. 45-46.128 This is most probably Ratnakäras'änti, who is the author of the well-known Instruction on the Perfection o f Wisdom (Prajnäparäm itopadesa, Toh 4079). Chim Namkha Drak’s Biography o fA t is a (p. 80), citing a stanza from Naktso Lotsäwa’s E ig hty Stanzas o f Praise, lists Säntipa as one of the four main teachers of Atisa, the other three being Serlingpa, Bodhibhadra, and Jétâri. Hajime Nakamura (In d ia n Bu d d h ism : A Su rvey w ith Bio gra p h ica l Notes, p. 311) places Säntipa around 104 0, which would make him a contemporary of Atis'a.129 This may be Dharmaraksita, one of Atis'a’s the three main teachers on the awak­ening mind. He is attributed with having authored several mind training verses, the most well-known being T he W heel o f Sharp Weapons. Atibas other two awak­ening mind teachers arc Serlingpa and Kusali Jr., known also as Maitrlyogi. On the identity of these three Indian masters and their relationship to Atiia, see my introduction in M in d Train in g: T he G reat Collection and my notes to the individ­ual mind training texts attributed to these three masters.628 Notes to pages 6 5 -7 0"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 7 0 -8 0 6 2 913 0 This is probably the well-known author of numerous epistemological works. His name is also written sometimes as Jïtâri. Nakamura (p. 309) gives ca. 940-8 0 as the possible dates for Jetäri, which would place him fairly close to Atiia. Since Naktso Lotsäwa, who was not only Atisa’s contemporary but also visited Vikra- masila Monastery in India, lists Jetäri as a principal teacher of Atisa, one must accept this as credible.131 The following seven are the seven buddhas of the Medicine Buddha mandala.132 This is the historical Buddha ¿äkyamuni. He is the “fearless teacher” because he is said to have vowed to appear in the world during the most degenerate era in order to help lead sentient beings to liberation.133 This is an allusion to the eight bodhisattva disciples of Buddha Säkyamuni. See note 124 above.134 The five poisons are: (1) attachment, (2) aversion, (3) delusion, (4) jealousy, and (5) conceit.135 The five wisdoms are: (1) mirror-like wisdom, (2) wisdom of equanimity, (3) dis­criminative awareness, (4) accomplishment of aims, and (5) expanse of reality. According to Vajrayana Buddhism, these five dimensions of the Buddhas enlight­ened mind represent the perfected states of the five mental poisons.136 According to Monier-Williams, A Sa n skrit-En g lish D ictio n a ry, 1993 edition, a kïn âra literally means “a cultivator of the soil\" and can have the alternative mean­ing of “a vile man.\"137 The chapter commences with Atisa speaking. The opening Sanskrit sentence means “I pay homage to all the teachers.”138 This repeated name Kusali refers to the two Kusali brothers, the younger of which is Maitrlyogi.139 Earlier, when paying homage to a similar group of teachers, it read, “To Maticâla and Tilopa the yogi,/ To Catipäla and Mañjusribhadra...” The difference is intentional.140 This is Maitriyogi to whom the mind training work, M elodies o f an A d a m a n tin e So n g (M in d Train in g: The G reat Collection, entry 10), is attributed, while Raksita in the following line refers to Dharmaraksita to whom is attributed the well- known W heel o f Sharp Weapons and The Peacock's N e u tra lizin g o f Poison (M in d Training: The G reat Collection, entries 8 and 9). Together with Master Serlingpa, they are known as “the three awakening-mind teachers of Atis'a.” See my intro­duction in M in d Training: T he G rea t Collection.141 Although the text states that there are five precious benefactors, only four are listed.

The first two are causes, while the last two their fruits— i.e., Dharma leads to liberation, while wealth leads to the fulfillment of one’s desires. Together, these four factors embody all the mundane and spiritual aspirations of an individual. This concept, if not exactly the same, probably shares the same origin with the Hindu idea of the four aims: the pursuit of (1) wealth as a means to fulfillment of (2) desire, and the pursuit of (3) Dharma as a means for attaining (4) liberation.150 Dorlek is the abbreviation for Dorjé Lckpa (Rdo rje legs p a ) and refers to a pro­tector deity by this name. Similarly, Pekar (P a d dk a r), often written as Pehar (Pe har), refers to a protector deity by that name. Pehar is the principal protector of Tibet’s first monastery, Samyé. One of his main manifestations includes the pres­ent Tibetan state oracle, Nechung, who is believed to have hailed from Persia. The early Kadampa masters were highly critical of the Tibetan religious practice of pro­pitiating worldly protectors and emphasized the alternative approach of entrust­ing one’s faith more in the Three Jewels and the law of karma.1 5 1 Acala is the fourth of the Kadam’s four divinities; his name connotes “unwaver­ing\" or “immutability.”152 It is difficult to determine whether this is a reference to a specific icon of Maitreya in Tibet or an allusion to some canonical description of the height of the future buddha Maitreya. There evolved in Tibet the tradition of creating giant statues of Maitreya. In some cases, entire temples were devoted to the icon. For example, there is the famous Maitreya temple in Shigatsé in the Tsang province where the temple’s three stories are divided according to three different sections of the Maitreya’s body— his lotus seat and legs, his main torso, and finally his face.153 Tusita is described in the Buddhist scriptures as a celestial realm that has a special connection with the future buddha, Maitreya. For example, the first of the twelve great deeds of Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha of our era, was his descent from Tusita into the human world. In similar fashion, Maitreya, being the next buddha to appear in the human world, is the buddha associated with this celestial realm at present.154 In the Tibetan original, this second line is written in the instrumental case, thus giving the reading “Has not the Sage looked after the teachings?” (thu b p a s bstan p a ma bskyangs sam). However, I have chosen to read this in the genitive case, which, to my mind, gives a clearer sense.155 The Tibetan text reads 'o na 'khor ba stongs su bshd, which literally reads “If this is so, this will split open samsara into nothingness.” However, I have chosen to read the opening phrase as “if the law does so exist” (yod na), which seems to suit the flow of the narrative better.156 Ln ga p o d e y i skya b a r nos. These together are known as the f i v e recollections, in other words, (1) bringing to mind your teachers, (2) visualizing your body as a deity, (3) recognizing your speech as mantra, (4) contemplating all beings as your parents, and (5) experiencing the nature of mind as emptiness."},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 9 4 —100 631157 “The three spheres\" ( ‘khor gsum ) are the three key elements of an act— the object of the act, the agent, and the act itself. In this context, the text is referring to the act of dedicating one’s virtuous deeds toward the attainment of buddhahood for the benefit of all beings.158 As noted in the introduction to this volume, dohä (Sanskrit) refers to a genre of spiritual poems best described as spontaneous songs of deep religious experience. Written by mystics, who often lived as wandering hermits, these songs character­istically employ a style of writing that is closer to vernacular songs than high poetry. The most noted examples of dohäs in the Buddhist tradition are those attributed to the Indian mystic Saraha (ca. ninth or eleventh century). It is inter­esting to see the text attribute to Atis'a a statement advocating that Dromtönpa take the dohäs to heart as his main practice if he wishes to enter a swift path to buddhahood. For translations of Saraha’s dohäs, see Michele Martin’s transla­tion in Thrangu Rinpoche, A S o n g f o r the K in g, as well as Roger Jackson, Tantric Treasures.159 A dam aru is a small hand drum made from two small drums attached back to back. Two strings, each with a knot at the end, are affixed to the instrument such that, when you twist the instrument back and forth with your right thumb and index fingers, the knots strike the drums.160 It is difficult to determine whether the text here should be read as suggesting Atisa’s actual meeting with Saraha or as suggesting some kind of mystic encounter. Sahara’s historicity in general and his dating in particular remain uncertain. Some place him in the later half of the ninth century (Guenther), while others (Naka­mura) place him in the eleventh century. If the second dating is accurate, chrono­logically at least, it makes it possible for Atiia to have actually met with Saraha. Furthermore, the geographical proximity of Vikramalis'ila, Adías monastery in Bihar, to Bengal, the region where Saraha was thought to have been active, makes this even more probable.161 The Tibetan expression translated here as “concepts of solid objects with mass” is m am rto gp h an gp h un g. It refers to the belief that external objects exist inherently, independent of the mind that conceives them.162 These lines relate to the practice and realizations of the ten perfections— giving, ethical discipline, forbearance, joyful perseverance, concentration, wisdom, skill­ful means, power, aspiration, and transcendent wisdom. According to the Mahayana doctrine of the bodhisattva ideal, the perfection of these ten practices is associated with the attainment and transcendence of the ten bodhisattva levels on the way to attaining full buddhahood. This list is an elaboration on the six per­fections that constitute the core of the bodhisattva’s path to enlightenment.163 These and the subsequent lines echo concerns similar to those expressed in the mind training text “Peacock’s Neutralizing of Poisons” (stanzas 48-56, M in d Train­in g : G reat Collection, pp. 163-65). They severely criticize those who, using the rhet­oric of the superiority of Mahayana, especially tantra, denigrate the basic ethical norms outlined in the Buddha’s teachings.164 A Tibetan myth says that lion’s milk is so powerful that only a container made of precious metals can contain it.

Notes to pages 1 0 3 - 1 $165 The original Tibetan here is highly obscure, which is aggravated further by the use of several archaic Tibetan terms. However, the point being made is that Drom- tönpa felt that he could serve the overall well-being of the Buddhas teaching best by keeping the secret mantra teachings hidden while propagating the three scrip­tural baskets.166 Again, this entire paragraph in the Tibetan original is quite obscure. The key point is that the teachings of the three scriptural baskets are highly beneficial with vir­tually no risk involved, while the teachings of the secret mantra are for many prac­titioners extremely risky with questionable long-term benefit.167 That is, with the basic Buddhist injunction to adopt positive actions and reject harmful ones.168 The key Tibetan word here is the archaic rme ‘khrug, which could be an abbrevi­ation of dm e ba 'khru gpa. I have read this as referring to the old Tibetan concept of rm e g rib , a curse that manifests as perpetual strife within the members of the same clan. According toTsenla NgawangTsiiltrim’s Golden M ir r o r U n ra velin g the Terms (p. 678), a lexicon on archaic Tibetan terms, the term sm e can mean suffer­ing or uncleanliness.169 Sems k y i b sla bp a, the second of the three higher trainings, the other two being the higher training in morality and the higher training in wisdom. This second higher training is known also as the higher training in concentration (bsam g ta n ) or in meditative absorption (tin g n g e ’d zin ).170 The metaphor of shallow crossing points appears to be popular among the early Kadam masters, the most famous example being Potowa’s saying, “There is no need to lift your clothes twice to walk across one shallow crossing point [of a river].”171 In these verses attributed to the four divinities, “master” refers to Atis'a and “son” to Dromtönpa.172 The “two welfares\" (don gnyis) are one’s own welfare and the welfare of countless other sentient beings, the fulfillment of which marks the attainment of complete buddhahood.173 Grogs ngan g y i byu r b sh a l The Tibetan term byu r connotes a kind of negative energy that attracts misfortune. This is often contrasted with gdon, or “malevolent forces.” Unlike gdon, byu r typically refers to human-related misfortunes or “inaus­piciousness”— disrepute, unjust lawsuits, and so on. Hence the expression, “A bad person is a harbinger of misfortune” (m i ngan byu r g y i sna 'dren y in ).174 If the text is not corrupt here, which I think it is, the word K h u refers to Khutön Tsündrü Yungdrung, who later became one of the principal students of Atifa from central Tibet.175 As discussed in the introduction, this refers to practitioners of three levels or capac­ities— initial, intermediate, and great. This distinction between three capacities of practitioners— and the stages of the path related to them— were fitst systemati­cally developed in Atis'a’s L a m p f o r the Path to Enlighten m en t (Bodhipathapradipa), which later provided the framework For the stages o f the p a th (la m rim ) literature.176 For a description of the seven limbs, see note 118.177 Although lu n g can mean scriptural authority, it can also mean a “handle” or a “ring\" that can be connected to a hook, as in the Tibetan expression, “If you have the ring of faith, the buddhas have the hook of great compassion” (d a d p a 'i a lung y o d naJ thugs rje'i Icags d k y u y o d )."},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 115—2 9 633178 The following six paragraphs describe the practice of the seven limbs, for a listing of which see note 118.179 K h on gskran . Skran is the name of a specific illness in the Tibetan medical diag­nostic system. The Exten sive T ibetan -C h in ese D ictio n a ry (p. 176) gives the follow­ing definition: “A sickness resulting in the formation of hard lumps, either inside or outside the body, caused by indigestion of the unrefined part of food or by the dissolving of refined parts. If further delineated, there are around eighteen differ­ent types.”180 “Nonabiding middle way” is an epithet for what later came to be called Prásañgika-Madhyamaka. This is the standpoint of Indian masters such as Bud- dhapälita, Candrakirti, and Sàntideva that is espoused also by Atisa himself. Sim­ilarly, the expression “the great middle way” (d bu ma eben p o ) is used here to suggest that the middle way standpoint of these Indian masters represents the highest understanding of the teaching of emptiness, for it marks the transcendence of all conceptual elaborations.181 This refers to the whole set of practices, such as supplication, the seven-limbed worship, and so forth, chat were presented in relation to the meditation on the teacher earlier.182 The eight terrors are those of lions, elephants, fire, snakes, thieves, captivity, drowning, and spirics. The first Dalai Lama Gendlin Drup, in his Praise to Tärä, associates these respectively with their internal counterparts of conceitedness, delusion, anger, jealousy, pernicious views, miserliness, attachment, and lingering doubts.183 The “five drops” here refers to the five stages of meditation practice described ear­lier: visualizing (1) your teacher, (2) the Sage, Buddha Säkyamuni, (3) Tärä, (4) Avalokites'vara, and (5) the guardian Acala. You visualize each of the latter as seated within the heart of the former.184 This is most probably a citation from scripture, the source of which remains unknown.185 Drom is here dividing up the well-known twelve links of dependent origination, often depicted as the “wheel of life,” into causes, conditions, and effects with respect to a sentient being’s karmically conditioned birth in the cycle of existence.186 Here the text uses the Tibetan term khrims, which means “law,” “rule,” “regula­tion,” or a “norm.” Admittedly, the usage of this term here is somewhat peculiar. Perhaps it should be read as meaning “rules of usage in language” or “established linguistic convention.” Thus, speaking of tasting the mind as if it were a food would violate normal linguistic convention.187 The five heinous acts are (1) patricide, (z) matricide, (3) killing an arhat, (4) cre­ating a schism within the monastic community, and (5) causing blood to spill from a tathägata’s body out of negative intent.188 The Tibetan text in all available editions here gives the reading “There shall be eighty thousand or twenty-five thousand [trainees].” (b rg y a d k h rid a n g sto n g p h ra g n y ish u rtsa Inga'o). This, I feel, is an orthographical error, and the line should read brgya k h ri d a n g .. . In the Tibetan numerical system, each decimal has an inde­pendent name, and the text here lists three of these decimal units— hundred, ten thousand, and thousand.189 The expression “engaging in an unchaste conduct” (m i tshangs p a r sp y o d p a ) is"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"634 Notes to pages 1 2 9 - 3 5being used here as a shorthand for \"engaging in unchaste conduct out of perverted desires,” which refers to an act of sexual misconduct, rather than to sexual activ­ity in general. In Buddhist ethics, sex is not itself unethical; however, it becomes so for those who have taken the vow of celibacy, such as the members of the monastic order. Sexual misconduct, on the other hand, is unethical whether or not one has taken a vow of celibacy.190 Here the text is alluding to an important aspect of the bodhisattva ethics, accord­ing to which highly evolved bodhisattvas can creatively engage in the seven non- virtuous actions— the three bodily acts of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct and the four verbal deeds of telling lies, divisive speech, harsh speech, and frivo­lous speech— on the basis of the principle of skillful means. In fact, if the situa­tion demands a deliberate violation of the ethics of restraint from any of these seven nonvirtuous acts, such as when the well-being of a large number of other sentient beings is involved, refraining from the act is actually a transgression of the bodhisateva’s vows. For a detailed discussion of this important aspect of the bodhi­sattva ethics, especially with reference to their key scriptural sources in the Mahayana sutras, see MarkTatz’s Asanga's Chapter on E thics w ith the Com m entary ofT so n g-K h a -Pa , pp. 211-17.19 1 In other words, when samsaric pleasures abound, our afflictions mushroom, and the promise of enlightenment becomes so remote as to be nonexistent, like a flower growing in the sky.192 Although the Tibetan original reads “All these bursting bubbles are extremely sta­ble\" (shin tu brtan no sbu ba sdos p a k un ), I have read this line in the negative as dictated by the context.193 The core of a banana tree is empty and therefore insubstantial. The child of a bar­ren woman is another analogy to convey the idea that the remnants of past karma too have no substantial reality.194 An allusion is being made here to the Mahayana sutra D isp e llin g A jäta sa tru s Remorse (Toh 216 Kangyur, mdo sde, tsha, pp. 2iib-268b), where the Buddha refers to craving and grasping (the eighth and ninth of the twelve links of depend­ent origination) as parents and admonishes king Ajâtaiatru to slay them. The sub­sequent lines similarly advise the practitioner to commit the ten nonvirtues against these afflictions, thereby transforming the actions into virtues.195 The Tibetan text reads here as 'j i g rten g y i gtam dpe kha 'ug m a d a n g ma d e m a’i tshul byung. This expression, probably well known in certain parts of central Tibet at a certain time, remains totally obscure to me. I have read the Tibetan word ’ ug m a is a female owl and de m a n de mo, which is hen. We know from the context that Dromptönpa is suggesting that if the teachings are not given in accord with the mental level of the spiritual trainees, they will not be understood. This is akin to the offspring of a hen talking like an owl— she won’t be understood by the rest of her species. I must emphasize that, given the opaqueness of the Tibetan text here, my translation must remain only suggestive.196 This is probably an allusion to the story of prince Vis'vantara (Vessantara) in the Jä ta k a Tales, the collection of stories of the Buddhas previous births. In the Tibetan Buddhist canonical collection, or Kangyur, there is no specific category of texts under the title of Jä ta k a Tales, and the stories are found scattered in numer­ous scriptures, especially those belonging to the discipline basket. In commentar-"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 1 3 5 - 4 4 635tai collection, or Tengyur, however, there are five volumes in the Jä ta k a cycle, among which is Aryas'üra’s well-known Garland, o f B irth Stories (Jätakam älä). This work contains thirty-four tales, Vis'väntara being number 9, and was later supple­mented by the fourteenth-century Tibetan master Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé, thereby bringing the collection to one hundred tales. This prince’s life is seen as a highest example of the practice of the perfection of giving.197 “Faith” here refers to faith in the law of karma.198 Sbyangs p a ’iy o n tan beu g n yis; Skt. dvâdasadhütaguna. One of the earliest sources for this list of twelve qualities, in the Sanskrit texts, can be found in the K in g o f M ed ita tio n Sutra (Sam ädhiräjasütra) and Sutra o f the Ten Levels (D asabh üm ika- sütra). The qualities are ascetic virtues, such as owning little, living in isolation, begging for alms, and restricting one’s food and sleep. For a complete list of these twelve qualities, including their descriptions, see Dayal (193a), pp. 134-4 0.199 In theTashi Lhiinpo edition, this line reads \"Free of distraction, practice the four doors of concentration” (g-yeng m ed bsam gtan sgo b z h i mdzod).200 'K h a r gsiL A khakkhara stafF is a mendicant’s staff held in the right hand by the monk disciples of the Buddha. Fora drawing of the monk’s staff along with a brief description of the various parts and their symbolism, see Willson and Brauen, D eities o f Tibetan Bu d d h ism, p. 568.201 The reference to this walking staff as a cooler probably derives from a custom in India whereby Buddhist monks use die staff as a pole and place their yellow robes over it in order to provide shade when they pause to rest during their walks on a hot day.202 This Dipamkara should not be confused with Atis'a, who sometimes goes by che same name. This is instead the Buddha who came before Säkyamuni in the era prior to our own. Maitreya, mentioned in the next stanza, is said to be the Bud­dha of the coming era.203 Sems k yi bslab pa. This “training in mind” refers to the higher training in concen­tration and not to “mind training” (bio sbyong).204 This is probably a reference to one of the “eight great cemeteries” mentioned in the Vajrayana texts that were reputed to be places of great terror.205 In the following lines Adía is presenting the numerous qualities that characterize the attitude and lifestyle of the ideal practitioner who will uphold the monk’s staff. In many ways, most of these qualities pertain to such a person’s steadfast com­mitment to leading a simple life whereby, insofar as one’s own personal needs are concerned, the individual has the minimum of everyday chores. Hence, the ref­erence is to the fear of being caught up in a way of life that entails excessive chores.206 The Tibetan term m i chos, which I have translated here as “social norms,” refers to everyday social etiquette that Tibetan spiritual masters define as revolving around protecting one’s friends and family and combatting one’s enemies. Often, m i chos is contrasted with lha chos, the latter referring to spiritual norms that relate to the well-being of the practitioner in the future lives. For further explanation on this distinction, see note 315.207 Kogste längs p a s g z h i rdzogs p a . This is one of the most well-known lines from The Book o f K adam and encapsulates the principle of simplicity in a most vivid man­ner. The idea here is that a true monk practitioner will own nothing other than the items necessary for leading a monk’s way of life, such as the robes, alms bowl,"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"636 Notes to pages 1 4 4 —59and walking staff, so that when he stands up, all his worldly possessions stand up with him.208 This paragraph, especially the last few lines, is somewhat obscure. In essence, it seems to say that even the meditator who has forsaken home and embraced life in wilderness, if he is still beholden to social norms, will be held hostage to the var­ious demands from his family. They may argue that his devotion to a meditators life is selfish and that he should think more of looking after his parents and so on, thus undermining his commitment to Dharma practice.209 S d ig 'dzub refers to a specific hand gesture or m u d rä (phyag rgya). This gesture is performed by stretching out the right hand, with the thumb pressing on the mid­dle and ring fingernails and the index and the litde fingers extended. Numerous such formalized hand gestures exist in Buddhist rites as well in classical Indian dance.210 “Pristine melodies” (tshangs dbyangs) is one of the thirty-two exemplary marks of a Buddha. Described in terms of sixty different melodies of perfection, tshangs dbyangs, which literally means the “melodies of Brahma,” relate to the gentle and pleasing qualities of the speech of a fully enlightened being.211 Here the term disciple (ira va k a; Tib. nyan thos) is probably being used as a generic term for those who uphold the Vinaya discipline, which is the key component of the scriptural collections of the Disciples Vehicle.212 This stanza is one of the most quoted from T he Book o fK a d a m . It underlines in a beautiful way Atis'a’s insistence that the threefold pursuits of a spiritual trainee— learning, critical reflection, and meditation— must be undertaken in an integrated way and not in isolation from each other.213 The Tibetan text of the last two lines of this stanza is somewhat obscure and my translation presented here must remain only a suggestion. I have read the lines to state that, given that Atis'a’s approach toward the threefold pursuit of learning, reflection, and meditation is not a partial but a thoroughly integrated one, he understands perfectly how the referents of all our descriptions— that is, the world of cause and effect— resemble optical illusions. They may seem real but in fact they are devoid of inherent existence.214 N g a kha sgor gan g byung rtog m ed zo. Here I have translated the Tibetan term rtog m e d z s “without discriminating.” Dromtönpa appears here to be critiquing those who interpret the teaching of emptiness to imply the rejection of any evaluative judgment of right and wrong. This discussion is reminiscent of the key philo­sophical, epistemological, and soteriological issues raised in the Samyé debate, which, according to the Tibetan accounts, took place in Tibet between the pro­ponents of the simultaneist followers of the Chinese Ch’an master Mohoyen and the gradualist followers of the Indian master Kamalas'ila during the ninth century.215 A yojana is a unit of measurement for distance in classical Indian texts. The value of this measurement varies according to different sources. In the standard A b h i- dharm a system , which is the one most familiar to the Tibetans, a yojana (dpagthsad) is equivalent to about five miles. For a discussion of the conflicting values of this unit of measurement, see McGovern, A M a n u a l o f Bu d d h ist Philosophy, pp. 39-48.216 In other words, if someone perverts the teaching on karma by a misunderstand­ing of emptiness, the problem is with the persons view, and has no effect on how things actually are."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 1 6 1 - 8 6 637217 This refers to the fulfillment of one’s own ultimate welfare and that of others.218 The three qualities referred to here are: (1) erudition (mkhas p a ), (2) diligence (btsun p a ), and (3) kindness (b za n g p o ). In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, these three are perceived to be the key qualities of a truly accomplished spiritual teacher.219 Judging by the preceding exchanges, the “two” here refers to the two acts of: (1) admitting one into the order of the Buddhas teaching— in other words, intro­ducing one to the Buddhas teaching— and (2) conferring empowerment.220 This stanza presents the well-known seven-limbed practice. Interestingly, the order here is slightly different from the standard formula, with the making of offerings appearing last instead of second.221 Here as well as in the subsequent lines, Drom is speaking to himself in the form of a self-exhortation.2 2 2 This stanza illustrates the suffering of the realm of hungry ghosts, and the next stanza, on the “delusion-ridden,\" is a commentary on the animal realm.223 This is a reference to goddessTärä, one of Atisa’s principal meditation deities, who is believed to have prophesized Atis'a’s meeting with his key disciple, Dromtönpa.224 In the critical Tibetan edition, this line reads as J o bo mkhas p a khu y is m chod which translates as “Learned Atis'a shall be entertained by Khu.” This, I feel, is an orthographical error and should be read as J o bo mkhas p a bu y is mchod.225 This is the principal buddha of the Medicine Buddha mandala, who is depicted as blue, symbolizing the color of blue beryl, a medicinal fruit.226 These two lines are found in Atis'a’s Bodhisattvas Je w e l G a r la n d stanza ioc-d.227 This is a protection mantra associated with the protector deity Acala.228 I have failed to discern what significance this number fifty has here.229 The Tibetan term brdzes bcangs b y e d p a literally means “to hoist one’s robes and tuck them under the sash,\" as when crossing a river. Here Atis'a is alluding to the next chapter of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f D ialogues, “How to Hoist Your Robes to Cross the Mires of Desire.”230 N a y i me tog. 1 have not been able to identify what this flower is.231 A somewhat miraculous event is being described in the next few lines. It begins with Atisa being astonished to see flowers blossoming in winter in the grounds of Nyethang Or. When Drom states that the falsely solid forms of the flowers have just about survived intact, Atis'a suspects that Dromtönpa may have conjured these flowers and asks to see the tongue that made the statement. Atis'a miracu­lously sees a lotus growing on Drom’s tongue, as if a flower were growing in a pond in a meadow. Next Atis'a sees a miniscule replica of himself on that lotus, which, when touched by Atisa, causes much laughter in both the replica and the real Adía.232 In these lines Dromtönpa is first speaking to the flowers growing on the ground, asking them not to vanish, for this would reveal him to be a con artist. He then admits that in Tibet as a whole it is extremely cold, and that in the region of Uru in Central Tibet in particular, much of the ground freezes. He then goes on to say that if flowers blossoming in winter in Tibet pleases Atis'a, then it doesn’t matter whether the flowers are real or not, so flowers might as well grow on Drom’s tongue.233 The “mother” here refers to die perfection of wisdom (prajnäpäramitä; shes rab p h a r phyin). The four noble (ärya )beings are (1) the disciple noble, (2) the self-enlightened"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"638 Notes to pages 1 8 6 - 9 6noble, (3) the bodhisatcva noble, and (4) the buddha noble. “Nobility\" here con­notes those beings who have attained the level of path of seeing (that is, the direct insight into the ultimate truth of all phenomena) or higher on their respective paths. This stanza echoes the salutation verse of Maitreya’s O rn am en t o f C le a r R eal­izations (Abhisam aydlam kdra, Toh 3786, Tengyur, shes phyin, ka, pp. ic-i3a), where the author pays homage to the perfection of wisdom for giving birth to the four noble sons.234 The “irreversible ones” (p h y ir m i H og p a ) here refer to the bodhisattvas who have attained the eighth level (Skt. b h ü m ï), on which they totally eradicate all mental afflictions and their propensities.235 In the critical Tibetan edition this line reads “Stands ten million crystal reliquar­ies” (S h e l g y i m chod rten bye ba gnas). I have chosen to follow the Dergé edition, the reading of which is more consonant with the subsequent stanzas.236 In the lines that follow, the text is explaining the symbolism of the celestial man­sion of Avalokites'vara. The description of the mansion appears to follow the stan­dard mandala architecture of a square structure with parapet walls and so on.237 In the perfect symmetry of the mandala, the height of the celestial mansion is exactly the same size as its length and width.238 The reference to “son” and “servants” in these two lines remains obscure to me.239 At this point in the narrative, Dromtönpas appearance changes and he assumes the form of the syllable bhrüm . Consequendy, he is then referred to as BhrQm Jé.240 This is probably a reference to the crystal youth holding a staff who earlier appeared on the stamen of the large lotus.241 These two epithets conqueror (rgya l ba) and source Çbyung gnas) are allusions to Dromtönpas name, Gyalwai Jungné (rgya l ba’i 'byunggnas).242 It is unclear whether this reference to a ti is to be taken as an allusion to the Atiyoga of the Great Perfection (rdzogs chen), where a ti connotes something that is com­plete, perfect, or the highest, or whether it refers to the first part of Atis'a’s name. My own sense is that it is the latter.243 This is a reference to the Tathägata, namely Buddha Säkyamuni, who was described earlier as composed of refined gold.244 Tib. me sheL This same term is used also for magnifying glasses, since they can be used to make fire.245 This is probably an allusion to some well-known story from classical Sanskrit lit­erature. I have not been able to locate its source.246 Literally, “Lions Roar,\" Simhanada is an ascetic form of Avalokites'avara depicted seated on a lion. He is white with one face and two arms, his right hand in the gesture of granting higher attainments, his left resting on the seat at his back. For a detailed description, see Willson and Brauen, p. 270.247 In the next few stanzas, Dromtönpa presents the practice of the seven limbs, minus the limbs of prostrating and paying homage. He begins the presentation with the limb of offering and proceeds to the limbs of confessing and purifying, rejoicing, requesting the buddhas to turn the wheel of Dharma, appealing them not to enter into final nirvana, and finally, dedicating merit.248 This is the moon appearing as Dromtönpa, referred to earlier as Bhrum Jé.249 “Great Compassion” is Avalokitesvara in his thousand-armed form.2 50 Ja h hum bam hoh are the four syllables with which the invoked “wisdom beings”"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 196—2 0 6 639are dissolved into the visualized “commitment beings,” thus making them insep­arable. This act of uniting, an essential part of a standard meditation practice involving the visualization of deities, signifies that the practitioner’s visualization has become inhabited by the actual deities.251 Although I have not been able so far to find a source for the analogies of the twelve links of dependent origination as presented here in the sutras, Vinitadeva’s com­mentary, C le a r Exposition o f the Words o f \"C le a r D ifferentiation o f the D iscip lin e [B asket], ” Vinayavibhaûgapadavyâkhyâna (Toh 4114 Tengyur, ’dul ba, tshu, 14636) explicitly gives all these analogies.252 From this point onward, beginning with ignorance, the text gives a detailed expla­nation of the twelve links of dependent origination and the manner in which they resemble their corresponding metaphors.253 In the Tibetan thangka (painted scroll) of the wheel of life, which illustrates the twelve links of dependent origination, there is a rooster, a snake, and a pig inside the innermost circle. The rooster represents attachment, the snake represents aver­sion or anger, and the pig represents delusion. Each animal is grabbing another animal’s tail in its mouth, thus forming an interlocking cycle, symbolizing the interlocking relationship among the three poisons of the mind. The stanzas here present the function and negative effects of attachment.254 ' B r u da n g tshigspa bsnabs lu d sogs/ranggi grogs la ster byed cing. These two lines are somewhat obscure. Judging by the context, especially in relation to what follows immediately after, the reference seems to be to friends drinking grain alcohol from the same bowl. The suggestion seems to be that, in doing this, friends share with each other not only the grains from which the beverage is made, but also the fer­mented refuse as well as nasal mucus. In reading these lines in this manner, I have treated tshigs p a as a spelling error and corrected it as tshigs ma, which according to the lexicographical work Golden M ir r o r (B rd a d k ro l gser g y i me long, p. 721) refers to the fermented grains left over after the alcohol has been extracted.255 Beginning here, the text describes the function and negative effects of aversion, or anger.256 R kan sgra tog, which literally means making noises by clicking one’s tongue on one’s upper palate. The idea here is that the pig is enjoying what it is eating so much that it makes continuous loud chewing noises.257 Dergé edition: “Soften and seize the handle of the conscienceless heart” (kh rel m ed snying g i lu n g thag bsgrungs). To “pull up the strings of one’s heart” may be an expression for cultivating a sense of determination to do something.258 “Foulness meditation” refers to a systematic meditation, found in classical Bud­dhist texts, that is specifically practiced as an antidote to craving and attachment. For a detailed explanation of the Buddhist meditation on foulness, whose primary purpose is to help overcome lustful attachment to others’ bodies, see Bud- dhaghosa’s Visuddhim agga (translated by Bhikkhu Nanamoli as The Path o f P u rifi­cation}, chap. VI. See also §äntideva, Bodhicaryävatära, 8:40-7 0.259 This is an act of paying respect, somewhat equivalent to bowing one’s head in the custom of other cultures.260 Re sd u g g y u m a c i p h y ir gcod. A literal translation of this line would be “Why do you cut off the turquoise-adorned ears of hope and pain?” It is difficult to surmise what the allusion to hope and pain in this line signifies. Qne guess, perhaps a long"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"640 Notes to pages 2 0 6 -3 1shot, is that these turquoise earrings are a family heirloom of such monetary value that they are seen as a potential asset to liquidate during times of hardship. In my translation I have chosen to keep the line simple by omitting this reference to hope and pain.261 “Jowo” (jo bo) is a respectful term for one’s elder brother; it can also mean “chief\" or “principal” among humans or gods. The term also came to be applied to icons of buddhas in their enjoyment body (sam bhogakäya) forms, such as the principal statue inside the central cathedral in Lhasa. Here the term probably refers to Avalokites'vara.262 These three allusions refer to different varieties of animal rebirths.263 The specific sufferings and the characteristics of birth as a hungry ghost are described in the following lines.264 From this point onward, the text describes the specific sufferings of the hell realm.265 A monkey is the metaphor for consciousness in the wheel of life, where con­sciousness is the third of the twelve links of dependent origination.266 In the critical Tibetan edition these two lines read: “If threatened by humans he jumps to the ground/ If threatened by birds he escapes to the treetops” (m iy is 'jigs tse sa la bros! b y a y is 'jigs tse shin g riser bros).267 Form, feelings, discriminations, mental formations, and consciousness are of course the five psychophysical aggregates (skandhas) that constitute the existence of a person.268 “Enemy” here refers to death and the owner who is slain refers to the consciousness.269 This is the well-known fourfold emptiness as presented in the H ea rt o f Wisdom. For a translation of this famous Mahayana text and a Tibetan commentary, see The Dalai Lama, Essence o f the H ea rt Sutra (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 2002).270 The opening two lines of this stanza appear as the following in Khenchen’s “Elu­cidation of the Heart-Drop Practice,” which cites the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues. “Like mist, clouds, and light,/ I, the monk Dipam of appearance and empti­ness,/...” Although this version found in Khenchens text seems to be more valid,I have left the original as it is.271 This is a paraphrase of a stanza from chapter 9 of the K in g o f M ed ita tio n Sutra, Sam àdhirâjasütra, Toh 127 Kangyur, mdo sde, da, i6b z .272 This is a paraphrase of a stanza from the M eetin g o f Fath er a n d Son Sutra (Pitäputrasam ägam anasütra), which is part of Ratnakuta collection of sutras. Toh 60 Kangyur, dkon brtsegs, nga, jobi.273 The terms “victorious” (rgyal), “emerging” ( ’byung), and “abiding” (gnas) refer to three parts of Dromtönpa’s name, Gyalwai Jungné (R gya l b a ’i 'byung gnas).274 This is a reference to Radreng, Dromtönpa’s monastery in central Tibet.275 It is difficult to determine which five names are being prophesized here.276 This is probably a reference to the five recollections recommended byTärä earlier in the text: (1) calling to mind your teachers, the source of refuge, (2) calling to mind your body as the meditation deity, (3) calling to mind your speech as mantra repetitions and recitations, (4) calling to mind all beings as your actual mothers, and (5) recollecting your mind as the ultimate nature.277 Jfiâna here refers to Master Atis'a, whose full name is Dipamkaras'rijñána.278 “White Lotus” (Skt. P u n d a r ik a ; Tib. P a d ma d k a r po) is an epithet of Ava-"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 2 3 1 —4 2 641lokitesvara. Here it refers to Dromtönpa, who is seen as a human manifestation of Avalokites'vara.279 “Sahor” here refers to the city over which Atis'a’s father ruled in the eastern part of India. Alaka Chattopadhyaya {A tisa a n d Tibet, pp. 63-64) provides a brief analy­sis of the term and suggests that it may be a corrupt form of the Persian word iahor, which simply means city.280 This is a paraphrase of the famous opening salutation verse of Nägärjuna’s F u n ­dam en tal Wisdom o f the M id d le Way (M ülam adhyam akakärikä), where Nägärjuna describes the world of dependent origination to be devoid of eight defining char­acteristics. For an accessible English translation of Nägärjuna’s classic, see Jay L. Garfield, F u n d a m en ta l Wisdom o f the M id d le Way (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995).281 “Son of space\" (N a m m kha'i bu ) is being used here as another epithet of the crys­tal youth, who is actually a manifestation of Drom himself. In feet, this current “collection on appearance” within chapter 12 began with Atisa calling Dromtönpa “Stainless space” (N a m m k h d d r i m ed), an epithet in which the term space clearly connotes the emptiness and nonsubstantiality of all things.282 The Tibetan text of this line is somewhat obscure and my translation must be regarded as suggestive. I have read this line as a reference to Dromtönpa as Ava- lokitesvara. The Tibetan name for Avalokitesvara, Chenresik (spyan rasgzigs), con­notes someone looking at beings compassionately with his eyes cast down. The main point of the stanza seems to be to demonstrate that even Dromtönpa him­self is devoid of substantial existence.283 This is clearly a citation from a tantra. However, the source remains unknown.284 Source likewise is unknown.285 This is probably a paraphrase of a citation from one of the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, the specific source of which was not found.286 Dharm asam gttisütra, Toh 238 Kangyur, mdo sde, zha, 39ha. This exact citation can also be found in Sam yutta N ik ä y a , part III, 95(3) (translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in T he Connected Discourses o f the Bu d d h a , p. 952).287 I have failed to locate the source of this citation exactly as it appears here. Most probably it is a paraphrase of the following stanza from Com m entary on the A w a k ­en in g M in d ( Bodhicitta viva rana, 67bc-68ab), which is attributed to Nägärjuna: “Independent of the conventional/ No [ultimate] truth can be found./ The con­ventional is taught to be emptiness;/ The emptiness itself is the conventional.” (Toh x8ooTengyur, rgyud ’grcl, ngi, 4 1a).288 “Four sessions” refer to four formalized meditation sessions, which are recom­mended for someone engaged in a single-pointed meditative practice during a retreat setting. The four are: (1) early dawn to sunrise, (2) morning to midday, (3) early afternoon to late afternoon, and (4) evening to late night.289 L h a n cigskyesp a ’i lha d r e g n y is/ra n g d a n g ra n g g i blagnyisso.

This is the well-known Vajrayana Buddhist practice of “transference of consciousness” {'p h o b a ; pro­nounced p o w d ), which is one of the “Six Yogas of Naropa.”292 These are om, ah, and hum, which respectively mark one’s crown, throat, and heart. In Vajrayana Buddhism, these three letters represent the body, speech, and mind of the enlightened beings.293 The “normal color” of Vajrasattva is white, Ratnasambhava below is golden, Amitäbha is red, and Amoghasiddhi is green.294 This is a reference to a earlier stanza of this section where it has been stated if the dying person recognizes the appearances for what they are, he will experience joy. In contrast, if he fails to do so, he will then experience fear.295 Despite all efforts I have not been able to discern what ü b h i means. Most proba­bly, it’s part of or a degenerated form of a Sanskrit term.296 R n a l 'byor sp y o d p a ’i dbu m a p a ! d bu m a’i dbyings su d b u ma ’gro. The expression m a l ‘byor spyod p a ’i d b u ma p a is Tibetan for Yogäcära-Madhyamaka, a subdivision of the Indian Madhyamaka school. Here, however, the term is used in a general sense to connote the upholders of the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school who practice tantra as well.297 P h y i m i Idog la d u n g ‘k h yil te. The Tibetan word translated here as “conch” is dung ‘khyiL This is probably an abbrevation of d u n g d k a r g.yas ‘khyil, which is a rare conch on which the lines curl in the opposite direction. This “right-curling” conch is considered by Tibetans a precious object endowed with auspicious omens. Such a conch is the crowning ornament in the depiction of the eight auspicious symbols.298 This is probably an allusion to the traditional Tibetan belief that, when highly evolved spiritual figures die and are cremated, their tongue and heart will often remain unburned.299 This is a reference to the five heinous acts, which result at death in immediate rebirth in the hell realms without an intervening passage through the intermedi­ate state just described. See note 187.300 This is a form of Avalokitcivara with one face and two arms who sits in a seated posture with his right leg extended. This particular aspect of Avalokitesvara has special significance for relieving the sufferings of the beings in the hungry ghost realm. For a description and a short meditation practice on this deity, see Willson and Brauen, zooo, p. 266.301 Rigs gsum n y id kyi sprul. The term rigs gsum is an abbreviation of rigs sgum mgon po, which literally means “the lords of the three classes.” They are Avalokitesvara (the embodiment of the compassion of all the buddhas), Mañjus'ri (the embodi­ment of their wisdom), and Vajrapäni (the embodiment of their power).302 “Lady” and the “white youth\" here refer, respectively, to Tara and Avalokiteivara.303 What follows in the subsequent lines is almost the entire instruction found in the mind training work entitled “Leveling Out All Conceptions” (M in d Train in g: The G reat Collection, root text, entry 12, and commentary, entry 32). Interestingly, here Atisa attributes the instruction to his teacher Avadhütipa, whereas in M in d Train­ing, it is attributed to Serlingpa.304 In the root text of “Leveling Out All Conceptions” in M in d Training, this line reads slightly differently as “Carry forth the force of all antidotes” (gnyen p o thams ca d bcom th eg yin )."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 2 7 4 —89 643305 D p a ' bo eben p o la sdig sgribs kyis b s d a d p a 'i glags med. In the Tibetan original, this sentence appears to be corrupt, so the translation provided here is only suggestive.306 This is most probably an oral instruction of Avadhütipa being cited by Acis'a.307 In this instance, I am translating the Tibetan word sr id p a , which literally means “possible,” as the modal verb “can.” I have read the expression “dejection is possi­ble” (zhum p a srid ) as an abbreviation of the full sentence “It is possible dtat dejec­tion will arise” (zhum p a skye ba srid).308 D e la s r id p a m i khegs lags. This line can also be translated as \"Its possibility can­not be ruled out.” However, I feel that the term s r id p a should be translated here as “existence” in the sense of cyclic existence, rather than as “possible.\"309 A translation of the story on illusion that appears here can be found in Geshé Wangyal’s Je w e lle d Staircase, pp. 142-4 7.310 Although this line is somewhat obscure, it probably means that Sriman did not believe in magical illusions before but, having experienced an illusion, he was then brought face to face with their lack of reality later on. In the same manner, though the experience of wandering in cycle of existence may seem real, it, too, is devoid of substantial reality.311 This is a reference to the Tibetan translator Naktso Lotsäwa whose personal name is Tsiiltrim Gyalwa. Not only was he the main Tibetan who successfully brought Atisa to Tibet, he also became one of Atis'a’s important students and a collabora­tor on numerous translations of Indian Buddhist texts into Tibetan. Naktso Lotsäwa is the author of the well-known verse biography of Atisa known as the H u n d re d a n d Ten Stanzas o f Praise (B sto d p a brgya bcu p a ), the full text of which can be found in Yeshé Dondrup’s Treasury o f Gems (pp. 26-35).312 In this exchange, Adía is reported as stating that the instruction on the medita­tive practice of tong len (giving and taking) on the basis of the respiration process was first taught to him by Serlingpa. The complete instructions on this practice can be found in the well-known S e ve n -P o in t M in d T raining (M in d Train in g: The G reat Collection, entry 6) and Root L ines o fM a h a y a n a M in d T ra in in g zn A its anno­tated version ( M in d Training, entries 4 and 5), which together form the basis for the Seve n -P o in t M in d Training. For the relationship between these three texts, see my introduction in M in d Train in g: The G reat Collection and the annotations to the individual texts.313 The Tibetan expression mgo m jug log p a literally means “head and tail reversed,” and in general usage, simply means “upside down.” Here I have chosen a literal translation so that Atis'a’s rhetorical question in the next line retains its pun in Eng­lish as well.314 In the Dergé edition, this line reads “Master, how does one extend this to other ornaments” (rgyan gzhan d a g l a j i Itar sbyar). However, here I have chosen to fol­low Tashi Lhünpo edition, which appears to be more accurate.315 The Tibetan term m i chos, which I have translated here as “worldly social norms,” literally means the “human dharma,” with dharm a in its broader sense of a “way,” “law,” or a “norm.” Often this term is contrasted with lha chos (literally, the “celes­tial Dharma”), the deeper spiritual and religious norms that pertain to the fate of future life. Sometimes, in the context of teachings on transcending mundane con­cerns, m i chos is used in a slightly pejorative sense with connotations of cunning and lax ethics."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"644 Notes to pages 2 8 ç —ç 8316 For a female monastic practitioner, this line should be read as “It is men and so on, so forsake them.” It becomes evident later on in the text that these pertain pri­marily to male monastic practitioners.317 This image of dying like an injured wild animal in the wilderness has a profound appeal for serious practitioners who devote their entire lives to single-pointed meditation practice. This kind of sentiment is echoed extensively in Tibet’s most famous meditator-poet, Milarepa, in his H u n d re d Thou san d Songs. The present Dalai Lama has also expressed that one of his regrets in living the life of the Dalai Lama is his inability to fulfill his deep yearning to be able to spend his last years as an “injured wild animal” in the wilderness.318 This is probably a reference to a death ritual, which, in the case of highly revered religious practitioners, would include the washing and cleansing of the bones fol­lowing the cremation.319 The three “white” ingredients are milk, yogurt, and butter, and the three “sweet” ingredients are honey, sugar, and molasses.320 D ru g cu rtsa re’i sdug byas pas. It is difficult to discern whether this number refers to a specific list of pains or it is simply an expression for many.321 The five fields are: (i) Sanskrit grammar, (2) logic and epistemology, (3) arts and crafts, (4) medicine, and (5) inner science, this latter field referring to Buddhist thought and practice. These are the five fields of classical knowledge according to Indian Buddhism.322 Having described the negative consequences of indulging in alcohol, meat, and so on in the previous stanzas, Dromtönpa then goes on to criticize what he perceives to be the excesses of those who indulge in such things under the pretext of pos­sessing advanced spiritual realizations of “nonconceptuality,\" “nonclinging,” “pure vision,\" and so forth. He asserts that, when caught in the afflictions, such things become nothing but expressions of basic afflictions like delusion, attachment, conceit, jealousy, and aversion.323 Lton g Itong ze r z h in g rdo rje ’gros. This line is somewhat obscure, and the transla­tion provided is only suggestive.324 This is probably a reference to the following statement found in Perfection o f W is­dom in T w en ty-F ive Thousand L in es (Toh 9 Kangyur, shes phyin, vol. kha, 245hl) : “O son, Siradvatiputra, it is thus: This profound perfection of wisdom will per­form the task of the Buddha in the future, at a later time, in the southern and northern regions.” The “conquerors’ mother” is the perfection of wisdom in female form, who is metaphorically understood as the mother of all buddhas.325 Since Radreng Monastery was founded by Dromtönpa in 1056, just over a year after Atibas death, this stanza is traditionally recognized as a prophesy pertaining to the founding of Radreng Monastery, which became the seat of the Kadam school.326 The svastika, though infamous in the West due to its association with Nazi Ger­many, is an ancient Indian symbol that represents stability and auspiciousness.327 The “four foundations of mindfulness,” the “four perfect endeavors,” and the “four factors of supernatural feats” refer to the first three sets from the thirty-seven factors of the path to enlightenment. For a succinct description of these from the Sanskrit and Tibetan sources, see His Holiness the Dalai Lama, T h e W orld o f Tibetan B u ddh ism , pp. 20-22."},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 2 p ç —} Z 2 645328 From this point onward, the text gives symbolism for the different aspects of the the landscape at Radreng. It begins with reference to seven mountains that sur­round Radreng to the north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northeast, and which are compared to the seven royal emblems.329 This might be an allusion to an old Tibetan myth of cosmic creation according to which the entire universe is supported on the back of a giant turtle. Alterna­tively, it could be an allusion to a specific rite of geomancy where a drawing of a turtle with relevant inscriptions is buried in the foundation when constructing a temple.330 This is a reference to the well-known “three scopes”— initial, intermediate, and great— presented in Atisa’s L am p f o r the Path to Enlightenm ent. For more on this, see my introduction to this volume.331 InTibet, being well oiled or greased is considered a sign of being looked after with care. This relates to both one’s skin, especially the face, as well as household fur­nishings, especially the wooden floor inside one’s house.332 'P han y u l rig p a bsam grub. I have read the Tibetan word 'p h a n y u l as referring to the region of Phenpo, which is in the southwestern part ofTibet. This is the region in which the Yerpa retreat, the site where all the dialogues contained in T he Book o fK a d a m are supposed to have taken place, is located.333 Sn um rtsi. It is difficult to discern what substance is being referred to here by this Tibetan word. Generally, snum is used to refer to oil, while rtsi refers to some kind of glue-like substance that helps things adhere to the surface on which the sub­stance is applied.334 Jinasagara, a Sanskrit epithet meaning “conqueror ocean” (Tib. rgyal ba rgya mtsho), is the name of a specific form of Avalokitesvara. For a brief description of the iconography of this deity, see Willson and Brauen, p. 270.335 S la nga. This is a wok-like metal container without a handle used in Tibet to roast barley in hot sand. Roasted barley flour is a staple of the Tibetan diet.336 The names in parentheses are found in the Tibetan original and were probably added by a later editor to identify the key disciples of Dromtönpa who arc being prophesized here by Atisa. Our editor writes Potow a as Putow a, which, although not a common spelling, is found elsewhere as well.337 This and the following lines echo the well-known debate between the “sudden” and “gradual” approaches to enlightenment. The term used in this text is one- stroke approach (geigehod), which has the same meaning as sudden (geigsbyar). This was the principal issue at the famous Samyé debate, which is thought to have taken place between the Indian master Kamalas'ila and the Chinese Cha’n master Hoshang Mohoyen in the eighth century. Most interestingly, here the two stand­points are placed in the voices of two students of Atifa, with Dromtönpa as a pro­ponent for the gradual approach and an Indian yogi as the proponent for die sudden approach.338 Rhugs d o m b hi kyed da n g k y a d m i mnga'. Here, Atis'a calls the Indian yogi who had been debating with Dromtönpa Dombhi. Most probably, the yogi who appeared in a pure vision to partake in the discussion with Dromtönpa is to be recognized as the mahasiddha Dombhipa, one of the eighty-four mahäsiddhas, or “perfected ones,” of classical India.339 From this point on in this chapter, Atis'a cites the instructions of numerous"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"646 Notes to pages 3 2 2 —40masters, beginning with his principal teacher, Serlingpa. In addition, he cites: Ava- dhütipa, jetäri, Dharmaraksita, Säntipa (known also as Ratnäkaras'änti), Dombhipa, Vidyäkaukila, Näropa, and Tilopa. Although the instructions attrib­uted to the individual teachers appear as block quotes, they do not appear to be citations from these masters’ written works. Rather, the text gives the impression that Atis'a received such teachings personally.340 Rgyu m agnye ma m chin p a dang. I have translated the Tibetan gnye m a as tendons based on the Extensive T ibetan -C h inese D ictionary, which defines it as part of the fibrous tissue between the joints.341 This is the first story in the H u n d re d B irth Stories, or Jä ta k a Tales, that narrate the Buddhas previous lives. See note 196 above.342 In these stanzas, it is difficult to discern which texts of Saraha and yogini Nägi are being alluded to in the instructions attributed to them.343 Gangs can mtsho. Literally meaning the “Lake of the Snow Mountains,” this prob­ably refers to Lake Manasarovar, which is at the base of the sacred Mount Kailash in western Tibet.344 Despite efforts I have failed to determine which text of Candrakirti is alluded to in this instruction. It may be that only the first line of the stanza, i.e. “Jealousy destroys one’s own roots of virtue,” is being attributed to Candrakirti here.345 This is probably a paraphrase of a stanza from the root tantra of Cakrasamvara, although I have not been able to locate it.346 The Tibetan terms I have translated here as “superficial friendliness” and “flattery” are ngo dga’and p h ye ’thor respectively. The first term literally means “happy face” while the second term translates as “sprinkling flour,” suggesting that one is show­ering someone with friendly statements, the whiteness of the flour representing something positive.347 This distinction between “divine spiritual norms” (lha chos) and “mundane human norms” (m i chos) appears to be very old, probably dating back to pre-Buddhist period in Tibet. Generally speaking, divine spiritual norms refer to some kind of religious or spiritual norms that pertain to one’s well-being beyond the present life. By contrast, mundane human norms relate primarily to cultural, social, and civic values of decency, prudence, and collective responsibility. The most well-known enshrinement of these two sets of norms is found in the so-called “ten virtues of divine norms” (lha chos dge ba bcu), which refers to the morality of refraining from ten negative actions, and the “sixteen mundane human norms of pure conduct” (m i chos gtsang ma bcu drug), which refers to a set of sixteen values. The seventh- century Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo is credited with having established these two lists of norms.348 “Endurance world” is a technical name used in the classical Buddhist scripture to refer to our world. For an explanation of this name, see note 418.349 M a tha’a n g khrom rgyal sdes khas 'byed p a y in . The Tibetan original of this sentence is extremely obscure, and the translation I have provided is only a suggestion.350 This is a reference to one of At¡¿a’s teachers, who is simply referred to Vajrasana (rdo rje gdan p a ), literally, the one from Bodhgaya.351 This is most probably a reference to Nägärjuna.

The verse is included, however, in Vasubhandu’s commentary on Maitreyas text, M ad hyän tavibh an ga- tikä, chap. 5, Toh 4027 Tengyur, sems tsam, bi, 113.7.353 It is clear from the text that the following stanzas from Vasubandhu, are being cited from a visionary experience that Adía had in India. “Kas'miri seats of learning” refers to the monastic centers of a branch of the Vaibhasika school of Indian Bud­dhism that was active in the region of modern-day Kashmir.354 B io snying branggsum . In a more liberal translation, this expression could be trans­lated as “ones mind, heart, and soul.\" Given the loaded meaning of the word “soul,” I have opted to keep my translation literal.355 The Tibetan text of these last five sentences appears somewhat obscure and the translation provided here is only suggestive.356 Sen g Idan. Monier-Wiliiams (A Sa n skrit-En g lish D iction ary, p. 836) gives the fol­lowing explanation for the Sanskrit word k ha d ira: “ A ca cia catechu (having very hard wood, the resin of which is used in medicine, called Catechu, Khayar, Terra japónica).”357 This is probably an allusion to Dharmaraksita, one of Atis'a’s three masters on the awakening mind. According to the tradition, Dharmaraksita is a follower of the Mahäsämghika branch of the Vaibhasika school of Indian Buddhism. For a brief discussion of Dharmaraksita and his teachings, see the introduction to M in d Training: T he G rea t Collection.358 S lu g sp o b k o d p a ; Sanskrit, G hanavyüha.359 Here, I have followed the Dergé edition. In the critical Tibetan edition, this line reads “So, not selling me as merchandise...”360 The term “training in mind” (sems k yi bslab p a ) is another name for the training in meditation, which is second of the three higher trainings, the other two being the training in morality and the training in wisdom.361 The three spheres are (1) the agent, the person making the dedication, (2) the object to whom the dedication is made, and (3) the m aterial, the substance being dedicated.362 “Wheel of feasts\" (.tshogs kyi ‘khor lo ; Sanskrit, ganacakra) refers to a ritual cere­mony in the highest yoga class of Vajrayana practice. In its original context, the practice involved a gathering of various male and female tantric practitioners for a feast of celebration. This ceremony is particularly popular in the so-called mother tantras, such as Cakrasamvara.363 The “four pairs of personages” (skyes bu zu n g b zh i) are four classes of individuals on the disciples path. They are (1) stream-enterers, (2) once-returners, (3) nonre­turners, and (4) arhats. Each of these has two stages, the first the stage of entering and the second the stage of abiding in the result, thus making eight types of indi­viduals altogether.364 In general torma refers to a ritual cake, customarily made of roasted barley dough and decorated with butter at the front, that is consecrated and ritually offered to all classes of objects, such as buddhas, meditation deities, and protectors, includ­ing the local guardian spirits.365 The two supports mentioned arc the power of the basis.

These four are the key ingredients in a successful purification of negative karmic imprints.366 Although the Tibetan text of this preamble is somewhat obscure, it seems obvious from the context that it refers to one of the traditional understandings of the ori­gin of the T he Book o f K adam . According to this view, it is Mafijuiri who, after having heard the entire dialogue that took place between Atis'a and Dromtönpa at the retreat ofYerpa, appears to Ngok Lekpai Sherap (the student being referred to as resembling Mafijus'ri) and incites him to go to Yerpa to receive the entire instructions. So, upon his arrival at Yerpa, Ngok requests Atis'a to give an oral transmission of the entire dialogue, and Atis'a complies by repeating everything once again for his benefit. A similar reference to the origin of the teachings of Je w e l G a rla n d o f D ialogues a p p â t s later in the colophon.367 This is probably a reference to che twin aims of bringing about ones own welfare and the welfare of others.368 “Chariot” is being used here as a metaphor for Dromcönpa’s Kadam tradition, sug­gesting that this tradition is like a great carrier that can transport many people to buddhahood. This resonates with the Tibetan custom of referring to Nägärjuna and Asanga as the “two great chariot leaders” (thin g rta 'i srol \"byed chen p o gnyis), meaning the two seminal figures of Mahayana Buddhism. In this epithet, the two Mahayana schools— Middle Way and Mind Only— are being compared to two great carriages.369 These three exact lines appeared earlier in chapter 8. See note 207.370 Known as the “twelve Tenmas” (bstan ma bcu gnyis), these are-a group of twelve female protectors, all of whom are associated with different mountain ranges in Tibet.371 Atisa is stating here that he will die within a year and fortnight’s time. The refer- nence to Maitreya here is to indicate that he is being called to Maitreya’s bud- dhafield, which is the heavenly realm of Tusita.372 This “central land” probably refers to India, the birthplace of Buddhism. If this reference is correct, the text here is suggesting thac it was Atisa who “brought” the twelve Tcnma protectors to Tibet from India.373 In the critical Tibetan edition as well as in the Dergc version, this line reads, “Con­ceited speech and speech of untamed horses.” This is definitely an orthographical error. The context makes it clear that it is the afflicted views that are being referred to here. Instead of Ita it has been misprinted as rta.374 Byam s brise bskyed g sa l Ihod d e bshig. The Tibetan text of this line is somewhat obscure and my translation should, therefore, be taken only as a suggestion.375 These lines do not appear to be presented in the text as being spoken by Drom­tönpa. They seem to be added by an editor who compiled the teachings together as a single text. Although the Tibetan text of these particular stanzas is somewhat obscure, after paying homage to Dromtönpa as Avalokitesvara (hence the refer­ence to Buddha Amitäbha on his crown), the editor makes the following interest­ing points. First, he states that the root-text summary that encapsulates all the themes of the dialogue is without doubt Master Atiia’s own work. He then goes on to say that the collected dialogues between Atis'a and Dromtönpa stand apart (logs su bkol ba) as a collection in their own right, though no title was given to them by Atiia.

This is followed by the remark that, upon embracing the words of Master Atifa, the teachings were instantly written down. This is probably an allusion to the story of Ngok Lekpai Sherap being the scribe when Adía repeated to him the entire dialogue once again. Finally, the edi­tor says that it was written in “the Bodhgaya style\"; it is difficult to discern whether the editor means that it was originally written in some central Indian script or whether he is referring to a specific style of composition.376 In some ancient Tibetan texts, Tibet is referred to as Purgyal (spelled p u r rgyal or spu r rg ya l), which literally means, “the kingdom of Pu.” In his encyclopedic dic­tionary (D u n g d k a r tshig m d zo d chen mo), the Tibetan scholar Dungkar Lobsang Thrinlé asserts that, although there exist numerous explanations of the meaning of this expression, “the kingdom of Pu,” it may have originally evolved as the name of the dominion ruled by the Tibetan king Pudé Gungyal, who is traditionally listed as ninth in a line of Tibetan kings starting from Nyatri Tsenpo. The histo­rian Christopher Beckwith ( Tibetan E m p ire in C en tra l A sia , p. 8), states that in the O ld Tibetan Chronicle, the Tibetans of the Namri Songten period refer to their king as “the king of Pu” (spu).377 Dergé: “Negative friends are of inferior fortune;/ They recognize only the practioners.”378 The “twenty birth stories” here refer to the first twenty stories of Dromtönpa’s for­mer lives as narrated in the “Son Teachings” of T he Book o f Kadam . These first twenty birth stories are called the “Ngok cycle of teachings” (rngog chos), as they were told in response to requests from Ngok Lekpai Sherap. The remaining two birth stories are known as the “Khu cycle of teachings” (khu chos), as they were requested by Khutön Tsöndru Yungdrung.379 For an explanation of the enumeration of the Father Teachings, see my introduc­tion. In this \"collection on the story of the origin” we are told that, of the twenty- three core chapters of the Father Teachings, the first twenty-one were actually revealed to Ngok Lekpai Sherap by Mafijusri in the forest, while the two remain­ing chapters were taught by Atisa upon Ngok’s arrival at the retreat of Yerpa.380 This and its immediately preceding line together state that the chapter on the sacred seal and the diamond songs were taught after the twentieth of the Ngok cycle of teachings— namely, the first twenty birth stories of Dromtönpa— had been given. For the listing of the chapters of the Father Teachings and the Son Teachings of The Book o f Kadam , see my introduction.381 In this line, the “conqueror\" refers to Atiia, “his source” refers to Dromtönpa (which is the translation of the second part of his name, Gyalwai Jungné), and the “the Sherap pair” refers to Ngok Lekpai Sherap and Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen. These last two figures are closely associated with the development, dissemination, and sustenance of the unique teachings related to the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.382 The three Gyaltsens referred to here are; Phuchungwa Shönu Gyaltsen, Rinchen Gyaltsen, and Dharma Gyaltsen, all three of whom are associated with the trans­mission of the Kadam lineage of inspiration. Namkha Rinchen, the author of a versified account of the lineage of the teachers responsible for early transmission of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f D ialogues, lists Dromtönpa, Ngok Lekpai Sherap, Ngari Sherap Gyaltsen, Phuchungwa Jangchup Gyaltsen, Rinchen Gyaltsen, Dharma"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"650 Notes to pages 3 9 5 -4 0 6Gyaltsen, and Jangchup Namkha, as the “seven precious individuals” (skyes bu rin chert bdu n ).

Despite efforts, I have not been able to identify what source our author, Khenchen, is using for this long citation attributed to Serlingpa.386 “Infinite light” is probably a reference to Amitäbha (literally meaning “infinite light”), whose head crowns the other ten heads ofThousand-Armcd Great Com­passion Avalokiteivara.387 The Tibetan original is d r i m ed chos kyi mchos rten rab m d zesp a , which translates as “They adorn the beautiful unblemished golden stupa.” Here, I have instead chosen the reading in the Dergé edition.388 This is probably a reference to the Dharma protectors who employ all four means of activities— pacifying, wealth-increasing, influencing, and wrathful— to carry out their oath as protectors.389 This line is partly a word play on the meaning of Dromtönpa’s name, Gyalwai Jungné, which translates as “source of conquerors.”390 “Fame of the Dharma” (Chölcyi Drakpa; Sanskrit, Dharmakirti) is the personal name of Serlingpa, Adías principal teacher on awakening mind.391 It is difficult to discern the source of Khenchen Nyima Gyaltsens citations from Avadhütipa provided here.392 This stanza and the three stanzas that follow are from chapter 12 of the J e w e l G a r­la n d ofD ialogues.393 This and the next four stanzas are from chapter 9 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.394 This and the subsequent stanza are from chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.395 This and the subsequent two long stanzas are from a separate section of chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.396 This and the last two stanzas are from another section of chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.397 In this line in the Je w e l G a rla n d o f D ialogues, Drom is referred to as Bhrüm Jé.398 This stanza is also from chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.399 This excerpt comes from chapter 10 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.400 In the Je w e l G a rla n d o f D ialogues itself, this line reads “Knives rain down from trees which they confused for cooling shade.\"401 The first three lines of this stanza are from chapter 12 of the J e w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.402 The remaining stanzas of this section are from a separate section of chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.403 This excerpt is from chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 4 0 7 - 2 1 651404 This and the two subsequent stanzas come from chapter iz of the Je w e l G a rla n d o fD ialo gu es.405 The stanzas from this to the end of the stanzas cited in this section are from chap­ter 16 of the J e w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.406 This entire section in verse is from chapter 12 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.407 These three stanzas are from chapter 9 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.408 The following stanzas are from chapter 16 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.409 These two stanzas are from chapter z of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.410 This and the two subsequent stanzas are from chapter zz of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.4 11 This entire extract is from chapter 9 of the Je w e l G a rla n d o f Dialogues.412 In the Je w e l G a rlan d o f Dialogues, this line reads: \"What is illuminated is conception- free and devoid of substantial reality.” Most probably, the reading found here in Khenchen’s text is corrupt.4 13 This is entry I of our present volume.414 The text referred to here is the stanzas on the seven-limbs practice found toward the end of Dromtönpa’s Self-E xho rtatio n , which is entry I of our present volume.415 The “three representations” refers to physical representations of a buddha’s body, speech, and mind by means of statues, scriptures, and stupas respectively.416 The following three auspicious stanzas are widely recited in Tibetan Buddhist rit­uals even to this day. They can be found in numerous earlier Indian Buddhist texts, especially those ofVajrayana class. See, for example, Prájñendraruci’s R in eben 'bar ba zhes bya b a i sgrubs thabs (Toh 1251 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, nya, 223a.)4 17 This rite of expelling the interfering forces (bgegsgtor) by means of offering them a torma ritual cake is a standard ritual performed at the beginning of many impor­tant religious undertakings, such as at the beginning of a long meditation retreat or when conducting an empowerment ceremony.418 E nd ura n ce W orld is a technical term and the translation of the Tibetan term m i m je d 'jig rten g y i khams (Sanskrit, sahälokadhätu). It refers to our particular world. Changkya’s lexicography {Source o f Becom ing Learned, p. 561) takes the Tibetan term m i m je d p a to be an archaic term for “endurance” or “forbearance” (b z o d p a ), which is consonant with Golden M ir r o r U n ravelin g the Terms (p. 630). In the lat­ter, the author cites Shiichen Tsiitrim Rinchen’s Catalogue o f the Tengyur, which gives a slightly different take on the meaning of \"endurance.” According to this second view, which is based on the W hite Lotus Sutra, this world is called Endurance World because the sentient beings of this world endure or defy the three primary afflictions of attachment, aversion, and delusion. Monier-Williams (Sa nskrit-En glish D iction ary, p. 1192) provides the following meanings for the San­skrit term sahâ—bearing, enduring, withstanding, defying, or equal to.419 The Tibetan text of this line is quite obscure and contains the strange word lo brtubs. In Yongzin Yeshé Gyaltsen’s T he R ite o f the M a n d a la o f the Sixteen D rops o f Kadam (p. 5234), where he cites these stanzas on the drawing of the mandala in their entirety, this word is written as logs btubs. I have not been able to find this word in any of the Tibetan lexicons, including the various “elucidation of archaic Tibetan terms” I have at my disposal. Judging mainly by the progression in die instructions for drawing the mandala, I have guessed that this word means “main lines.”"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"652 Notes to pages 4 2 2 —4 4420 In drawing a mandata, two units of measurement are used prominently: “door size” (sgo tshad) an d “micro unit” (cha chung).

For expla­nation of yojana, see note 215.459 This is a reference to the classical Buddhist conception of time cycles during which the Buddhas teaching will survive in the world. According to this view, the dura­tion of the Buddhas teaching is estimated at five thousand years, which is divided into ten five-hundred-year cycles.460 The Tibetan equivalent of Sujata, which is legs skyes, means “well born”; it could also mean “gift,” or “bringer of luck,” which is probably being invoked here in this line.461 This is probably a reference to the magical goose surrounded by eight geese.462 This is the same person as Ujjvala, although this is the first time he is referred to as Ratna Ujjvala, which can be rendered as “Illumination of the Three Jewels.”463 Sarat Chandra Das reconstructs the name phyags p a m ed p a as Aräga.

Asañga is the Sanskrit reconstruction of the Tibetan name Chakpa Mepa (chags p a m ed p a ).465 The name of the younger prince, Asañga, literally connotes someone who is free of attachment, so there is a literary device of iteration used here in this line, which, when translated literally, would yield the following; “Attachment-Free will jour­ney to freedom from attachment.”466 This is a reference identifying the monk with the goddess Tara.467 Yab bzher sku gshen ’brom d u gd a ‘.

He studied at Tashi Lhiinpo and Drepung monasteries and acquired great fame as a scholar. Gendiin Gyatso’s lifetime coincided with a deep political turmoil related to the allies of the Karma Kagyii school taking control of the city of Shigatsé and later Ü (central Tibet), including the capital Lhasa. His establishment of a close patronage relation with the Gugé rulers led to the successful spread of Geluk in the Ngari regions of western Tibet. Gendiin Gyatso founded Chökhor Gyal Monastery and Ngari Monastery, the former becoming a personal monastery of the successive Dalai Lamas, and also held the abbotship of Tashi Lhiinpo, Drepung, and Sera monasteries. His principal teachers include the reputed Geluk master and medita­tor Khedrup Norsang Gyatso, the author of Ornam ent o f Stainless L ig h t ( The Lib ra ry o f Tibetan Classic}, vol. 14).

At the age of eight he joined Tashi Lhiinpo Monastery, where he studied the great Buddhist classics for seventeen years and became recognized as a highly learned scholar. From age twenty-diree, when the great Geluk meditator Drupwang Lobsang Namgyal passed away in Kyirong, Yeshé Gyaltsen spent most of his life in the western part ofTibet meditating as a hermit, founding new monasteries like Samten Ling and Drip Tsechok Ling, and giving teachings to numerous students. When he was sixty-two, Yeshé Gyaltsen became the principal tutor of the Ninth Dalai Lama, Jampel Gyatso, and moved his residence to the Pótala Palace. Because of his pro­found learning, deep meditative experience, and skill as a great teacher, Yeshé Gyaltsen became one of the most important masters and custodians of the ear- whispered teachings of the Geluk school.491 The “two Senas” are Vimuktisena and Bhadanta Vimuktisena, both of whom are important masters in the lineage of transmitting Maitreya’s teachings related to the exposition of the perfection of wisdom sutras.492 This stanza is a salutation to Atffa, acknowledged here by Yongzin Yeshé Gyaltsen as an \"initiator of a chariot way” (shing rta’i srol ’byed), an appellation commonly reserved for the Buddhist masters Nägärjuna and Asañga.493 This is a reference to the great Tsongkhapa, who is recognized as an emanation of Mañjusri.

No details can be found on the identity of these three teachers referred to here.517 This is theNgari ruler who, together with his uncle Lha Lama Yeshé Ö, was instru­mental in bringing Atis'a to Tibet. It was, in fact, at the behest of Jangchup Ö, as testified by the opening lines in the text itself, that Atisa composed the famous L a m p f o r the Path to Enlightenm ent.

The order of the visualization of these aspects pre­sented in Buddhaghosa’s text is slightly different from the one presented here. See Path o f P u rification , chap.

In a visionary experi­ence, Chcngawa met with the Indian master Nagabodhi and received instructions from him, which he summarized into four sets of four practices. The set of four practices that is most well known is: (1) the yoga of recognizing all appearances as illusions by means of the analogy of sleep and dreams; (2) the yoga of recognizing the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness by means of the analogy of water and ice; (3) the yoga of recognizing all phenomena as being of a single taste by means of the analogy of the taste and mass of molasses; and (4) engaging in the con­duct of the six perfections (Yes hé Döndrup, Treasury o f Gems, p. 189).

Many of the thought processes suggested here are relevant principally to those practi­tioners who have chosen to lead a single-pointed, celibate life of a hermit, for whom the issue of gaining total freedom from attachment to the concerns of this life is of cardinal importance.539 Tsang is a region in central Tibet. Btsan, translated here as “ghost,” refers to spir­its of dead people that are described as aggressive.540 Phuchungwa Shönu Gyaltsen (1031-U06), one of the “three Kadam brothers,” dedicated his life to single-pointed meditative practice and did not cultivate many students. Phuchungwa is most recognized as the initiator of the Kadam lineage of pith instructions and the inheritor of Atiia and Dromtönpa’s teachings as enshrined in T he Book o f K adam .

A zho gan g is an old Tibetan coin made of copper.543 Nyukrumpa Tsöndrü Bar (1042-1109) was a student of Chengawa and is in the Kadam lineage of pith instruction. He founded two Kadam monasteries, Lung- shö Nyukrum and Thangkya, in central Tibet.544 As its name implies, a wish-granting cow fulfills the wishes of its owner, like the genie in Aladdin’s lamp. The wish-granting cow, along with the heavenly horse and treasure vase mentioned below, arc mythical objects that are often imagined in standard Buddhist rites of offering, especially the mandata offering, whereby the entire cosmos is offered to the object of refuge.545 According to Lechen’s L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition (p. 29234), Khamlungpa Shäkya Yönten (1025-1115) was, together with the three Kadam brothers, a recipient of Atis'a’s mind training teachings from Dromtönpa. He is also identified as the source of the instructions on “mind training in eight sessions,” whereby the practitioner learns to relate all key aspects of everyday life to the mind training practice of cultivating and enhancing the awakening mind. For a succinct instruction on this special mind training, see M in d Train in g: The G reat Collection, entry 22. Both Lechen {L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition, p. ioóbj) and Yeshé Döndrup {Treasury o f Gems, p. 195) list Khamlungpa as the fourth of the Kadam brothers and state that Khamlungpa met Atiáa in person.546 This is probably a reference to the Kadam hermit Ben Gungyal, who was famed for his colorful rejections of worldly norms. Ben Gungyal, whose personal name isTsiiltrim Gyalwa, was a student of Gönpawa (1016-82).

He was one of the principal disciples of the Kadam teacher Gönpawa, who was, in turn, a student of both Atisa and Dromtönpa. Kharak Gomchung is most known for his highly practical and con­cise teachings, most of which pertain to the central issue of overcoming attach­ment to the mundane concerns of this life. These teachings later became known collectively as the “three cycles of Kharak” (kha ragskor gsum ) (1) the Twelve Points of the Stages of the Path, (2) the Seventy Exhortations, and (3) the Training in the Awakening Mind. Although Kharak Gomchung’s complete first and the last cycles appear to no longer be extant today, large sections of the author’s work on the first cycle can be found in Chenga Lodrö Gyaltsens T he In it ia l M in d T raining: O pen­in g the D o o r o f Dhatrma. Kharakpa’s text on the second cycle of teachings can be found in Yeshé Döndrup’s Treasury o f Gems, pp. 257-64.548 This is probably a senior student of Dromtönpa who is known as spiritual men­tor Jolek (jo legs), a monk from the Drakgyap region. According to Lechen (L am p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition, p. 10634), Jolek met Atiia in per­son and was later to become a key student of Dromtönpa alongside the three Kadam brothers.549 Neusurpa Yeshé Bar (1042-1118) was one of the principal students of Gönpawa and the main inheritor of Gönpawa’s teachings on the stages of the path instructions. Notes compiled by Neusurpa’s students on his stages of the path instructions were widely disseminated. Lechen (L a m p Illu m in a tin g the History o f the K adam Tradi­tion, pp. I20a5-I28bl) provides detailed biographical information on Neusurpa, including citations from his teachings. Yeshé Döndrup ( Treasury o f Gems, pp. 203-38) also provides extensive extracts from Neusurpa’s own compositions as well as from the notes compiled by his students, especially those by Gezé Jangchup.550 LangriThangpa (1054-1123), a prominent student of Potowa and the author of the famous “Eight Verses on Mind Training,” was the founder in 1093 of Langthang Monastery in Phenpo, which attracted around two thousand monies. His princi­pal student was Shawo Gangpa, and the Kagyii master Phakmo Drupa also received teachings from him. Because of his constant contemplation of the suf­ferings of all sentient beings, Langri Thangpa is said to have been in tears most of the time and came to be known as “Langthangpa with a weeping downcast face” (L a n g th a n g n g u nag p a ).

Lechen (L am p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition, pp. i68b3~7ob5) provides a useful biography of this Kadam master, giv­ing some details of his first meeting with Naljorpa at Radreng Monastery. His stu­dents include Tokden Dingpopa, Geshé Lhaso, and Ja Dülzin.555 Lechen (L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition , p. 17734) lists Nambarwa as one of the “eight great outer students” (p hyi y i chen p o brgyad) of Jayülwa Shönu ö (1075-1138) as well as one of the “four senior sons” (bu chen bzhi) of the spiritual mentor Laksorwa (Yeshé Döndrup, Treasury o f Gems, p. 106), who was, in turn, a student of the translator Naktso Lotsâwa (10 11-64). Nambarwa founded the monasteries of Nambar and Rampa Lhading and held the abbotship of Sangphu Monastery for eight years {L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the Kadam Tradition, p. 337b2).556 The reading of this line is slightly different in the critical Tibetan edition. Here I have followed the Dergé edition as found in Yeshé Döndrup’s Treasury o f Gems.557 Both Lechen (p. 337b2) and Yeshé Döndrup (p. to6) list Chimphupa, known also as Rok Chimphupa, as one of the four senior sons of Laksorwa. Each of these four sons of Laksorwa is said to have compiled notes from Laksorwa’s teachings. Jadiilzin compiled a condensed collection of notes that contain both stories and instructions; Chimphupa’s notes contain few stories but extensive instructions; Nambarwa’s notes contain only instructions with no stories; while Shulenpa’s notes contain extensive stories and extensive instructions.558 Shawopa Pema Jangchup (1067-1131) was an important student of both Potowa and Phuchungwa, two of the three Kadam brothers. According to Lechen {L a m p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition, p. i29bz), he was a key student of Langri Thangpa (author of “Eight Verses on Mind Training”) as well. He founded the monastery of Shawogang, where thousands of monks congregated. Shawopa or Shawo Gangpa is sometimes written as Shawowa. In Geshe Wangyal’s T he D oor o f Liberation, however Shawo Gangpa is identified incorrectly as Sha-wo-gay-pa.559 This echoes the well-known Kadam saying that was earlier attributed to Chen­gawa. See p. 586 above.560 The original Tibetan text reads tshe ‘d i ’i d o d p a ’i skam sha 'tshal tsa na, which lit­erally translates as “If one seeks to find the dry meat of this life’s desire,...” Prob­ably, the author is evoking the analogy of eating dry meat, which, because of its dryness and also its salty taste, makes one thirsty, and which, when quenched with drinking water, probably leads to further craving for eating dry meat.561 Yar bskyed pas m a r bskyed che ba’i bong ba ’i rbab.

As I have not been able to find the expres­sion bong b a 'i rbab in any of the lexicons at my disposal, the translation here is only a suggestion.562 On this Kadam master, see note 547. Although, as the brief colophon makes it clear, it was Lhopa who compiled these sayings into a single collection, it is not evident who included these sayings as a supplement here. Neither this nor the next supplement are translated in Geshe Wangyal’s T he D o o r o f Liberation.563 Both the Lhasa Shöl edition, the basis of the critical Tibetan edition on which the present translation is based, and the Dergé edition found in Yeshé Döndrup’s Treasury o f Gems are missing one item from this list. Although this is supposed to be part of a set of four, there are only three items.564 In both the Lhasa Shöl edition and the Dergé edition, this line reads sp yo d p a'i gso bo kha snyen sg ru b p a ’o, which does not make much sense. I feel that there must be a typographical error, that kha snyen should be read as lha snyen, which means “rites that enable the practitioner to cultivate closeness with his or her meditation deities.”565 In both the Shöl and Dergé editions, one item is missing from this set. The “wisdom- knowledge empowerment” is the third main empowerment of the highest yoga class of tantra and involves offering a consort to the initiates for entering into sex­ual union as part of the empowerment rite. Typically, this empowerment is only visualized by the initiate.566 This last item probably refers to articles belonging to the monastic community. If such items are inappropriately used for one’s personal benefit, it is said to be like consuming burning fire.567 There are actually six rather than five sets in this section. However, since all avail­able versions of the Tibetan text lists the following section as “Five sets of six,” I have left this caption as it is.568 This is probably an epithet for the Buddha, in whose presence a Mahayana prac­titioner takes the bodhisattva vows.569 The Tibetan term mngon d u rgyu ba, which I have translated here as “manifest movement,” is probably equivalent to the term mngon d u phyogspa, “approaching.” The latter is the standard name of the sixth bodhisattva level, which marks a criti­cal stage in the practitioners direct realization of emptiness of all phenomena.570 The expression “innate path” (lhan skyes k yi lam ) probably refers to the Vajrayana path, in which the concept of innateness, especially the fundamental innate mind of clear light, occupies a significant place in the understanding of the nature of the path to full awakening.571 The “im puted nature, the dependent nature, and so on” here refers to the three- natures theory central to Yogâcâra analysis of the ultimate nature of reality.572 The spiritual mentor Lhopa was a principal student of Kharak Gomchung. None of the historians of Kadam— Sönam Lhai Wangpo, Lechen, Panchen Sönam Drakpa, and Jamgön Amé— nor Yeshé Döndrup, give Lhopa’s personal name. According to Lechen (L am p Illu m in a tin g the H istory o f the K adam Tradition, p. izoaz), Lhopa was already deeply learned in the works of Maitreya and specialized in the teachings of tantra before meeting Kharak Gomchung, at whose feet he studied and practiced for eight years.573 At the level of “heat,\" the first of the four stages of the path of preparation, the practitioner gains meditatively derived insight into emptiness on the basis of"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"664 N o te s to p a g e s 6 o ç - i oyoking together tranquil abiding and penetrative insight.

Among these, a similar list gives only three perfect fac­tors, all pertaining to the view of the practitioners of three levels of mental facil­ity, with no reference to m editation and action.

A core prescription of the Kadam school is to relate to all the teachings of the Buddha as personal advice, espe­cially to help overcome one’s mental afflictions.

Just as specific medicines are seen as antidotes for specific illnesses, specific mental states such as compassion, loving­kindness, and so on are identified as antidotes against specific mental ills.

Negative actions are motivated by any of the three poisons of the mind— attachment, aversion, and delusion. The classical Bud­dhist texts list ten classes of negative actions: three physical actions (killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct), four actions of speech (lies, divisive speech, harsh words, and senseless gossip), and three actions of the mind (covetousness, ill will, and wrong views).

One of the six perfec­tions that lie at the heart of the practice of the bodhisattva. The term refers also to a specific subdivision of the Mahayana scriptures that outline the essential aspects of the meditation on emptiness and their associated paths and resultant states. The Perfection ofWisdom in Eight Thousand Lines, the H eart Sutra, and the D iam ond Cutter are some of the most well-known Perfection ofWisdom scriptures. In The Book o f Kadam the term is often used as an epithet for Perfection ofWisdom Mother, a feminine divinity that embodies the perfection of wisdom of a fully awakened buddha.

The three scopes refer to the practitioners of initial, intermediate, and advanced scopes or capacities. Atis'a’s Lamp fo r the Path to Enlightenment presents the entire Buddhist path to enlightenment in terms of meditative practices appropriate to these three differing capacities— the initial, who seeks only a refuge from the fears of rebirth in the lower realms; the intermediate, who principally seeks freedom from cyclic existence; and the advanced, who seeks full awakening for the benefit of all beings, three scriptural baskets (sde snodgsum, tripitaka).

The bjong teachings are a source of inspiration and guidance shared by masters of all Tibetan traditions. This makes Thupten Jinpa’s translation of M in d Training: The Great Collection a natural choice for publication as part of the Library o f Tibetan Classics series. For the first time, this early collec­tion of the instructions of the great Kadampa masters has been translated in its entirety. The clarity and raw power of these thousand-year-old teach­ings are astonishingly fresh, whether studied as a complete anthology or opened at random for inspiring verses on the heart of Buddhist practice.”—Buddhadharma: The Practitioner’s Quarterly“Thupten Jinpa has done us all a great service by editing and translating this marvelous volume. In an era when Buddhist meditation is largely equated with simply calming the mind and developing mindfulness, this compendium of methods for training the mind gives a glimpse of the tremendous richness and depth of the Buddhist tradition for enhancing mental health and balance and realizing the full potential of consciousness in terms of wisdom and compassion. With the current rise of positive psy­chology, in which researchers are seeking a fresh vision of genuine happi­ness and well-being, this volume can break new ground in bridging the ancient wisdom of Buddhism with cutting-edge psychology.

Taking the Path as the Result represents a major breakthrough by bringing these teachings to light with the full blessings of the Sakya masters. In nearly seven hundred pages of translation, the indefatigable Cyrus Stearns presents an anthology of essential texts on Lamdré. This collection will be an invaluable resource for practitioners of the Lamdré system.”—Buddhadharma: The Practitioner’s Quarterly“No one is better suited than Cyrus Stearns to offer the first major trans­lation of Lamdré teachings to the world. He has studied intimately with the most revered leaders of the Sakya tradition for decades. Beyond this, Stearns possesses a quality that sets him apart from most translators today— he is a poet. Few have transmuted the verse or the prose, the earthy imagery or the celestial style of Tibetan Buddhist teachings, with compa­rable eloquence and inspiration; few are endowed with the capacity to inspire students of Tibetan Buddhism through force of the sheer beauty of the translated word. The Sakya tradition will henceforth be known to Eng­lish audiences in all its splendor thanks to this new translation.”— Kurds R. Schaeffer, University of Virginia“In this volume, Stearns makes available for the first time a selecdon of key texts from the highly prized esoteric transmission of the great Tsarpa mas­ters, translated with enormous effort and care. Students of the Lamdré will rejoice to see these often enigmatic Tibetan yoga manuals transformed into such lucid English.”— David P.

It was perhaps because of the popularity of this event and the success of others like it that when he was asked to select a text for the inaugural volume of the important new Library ofTibetan Classics series, the Dalai Lama chose a commentary on the Kälacakra tantra.
