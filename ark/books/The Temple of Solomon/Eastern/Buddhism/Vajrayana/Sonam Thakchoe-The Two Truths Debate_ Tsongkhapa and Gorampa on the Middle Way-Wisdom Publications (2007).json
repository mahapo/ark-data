Nothing could be further from the truth. The Tibetan scholastic adage, “where you find agreement, there you find fools,” reflects the diversity of this tradition and its commitment to the prosecution of philosophical debates and the juxtaposition of alternative viewpoints. There is no more dramatic instance of this diversity than the debate presented in this volume.Among Tibetan philosophers there is near unanimity that Madhyamaka, the Middle Way philosophy that originates in the work of Nagarjuna, rep­resents the apex of Indian Buddhist philosophical thought. Two of Tibet’s greatest Madhyamaka exegetes are Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), founder of the Gelug order, and Gorampa (1429-89), a major figure in the Sakya order. While Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree that Nagarjunas philosophical out­look is the highest expression of Buddhist insight, and that Candrakarti is his definitive Indian commentator, their agreement ends there.Central to Nagarjunas philosophical system is his distinction between the two truths—conventional and ultimate—and his complex account of their relationship. Dr. Sonam Thakchoe is correct to focus on this disagree­ment as an entree into the divergent outlooks of these two enormously influential and subtle philosophers. The heart of Madhyamaka philosophy is the doctrine of the two truths, and to disagree about this doctrine is to disagree about the very nature of the philosophical theory.Dr. Thakchoe is also correct to focus on the views of Gorampa and Tsongkhapa for his entree into the complex Tibetan debates about the interpretation of Madhyamaka.

Gorampa is a match for Tsongkhapa in scholarship and acu­men, and develops a radical critique of the reality and importance of the conventional.The dispute is both ontological and epistemological. Tsongkhapa argues for the ontological identity of the two truths, despite their conceptual dis­tinctness. Gorampa defends the view that ontologically the two truths are entirely distinct—one real, the other unreal. Tsongkhapa defends the view that there are standards of correctness for cognitive engagement with the conventional; Gorampa that all engagement with the conventional is delu­sive, and that there can be no sense in which cognitive engagement with the conventional can be described as correct. Dr. Thakchoe patiently takes the reader through these complex issues as well as the considerations that drive Tsongkhapa and Gorampa in such different directions from such similar starting points.Dr. Thakchoe’s exploration of Nagarjunas philosophy and its develop­ment through the Indian and Tibetan commentarial tradition is exception­ally clear and precise. He demonstrates to us that it is both genuinely difficult to work out the details and ramifications of the doctrine of the two truths and genuinely rewarding to do so. He shows that Buddhist philo­sophical inquiry, as prosecuted in India and in Tibet, can be prosecuted in English today with great profit.Dr. Thakchoe is eminently qualified for this task. He has a sound tradi­tional Tibetan education, with undergraduate and postgraduate degrees from the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies in India, where he was taught by some of the finest Tibetan scholars of Madhyamaka. He holds the Ph.D. from the University of Tasmania, where he received a fine training in Western philosophy. He is a native speaker of Tibetan with an excellent sense of philosophical English. This volume reflects this remarkable range of training and competence, replete with analyses grounded in extraordi­nary textual scholarship and nuanced familiarity with Tibetan interpreta­tive traditions, powerfully argued, and containing elegant and felicitous translations and commentary on translation practice.Dr. Thakchoe demonstrates that the tradition of philosophical debate brought from India to Tibet is alive and well in the West. The Two Truths Debate is an invaluable resource for the Buddhist Studies community and for all those interested in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.Jay L.

The book is a comparative analysis of their conceptions of the two truths—their respective understandings of the definitions of the two truths, the relationship between the two truths, the ontological status of the two truths, the epistemic resources for accessing the two truths, the problems con­cerning the limits of language and thought as these relate to the notion of ultimate truth, the different ways of realizing ultimate truth, and, finally, the nature and possibility of knowledge of the two truths and the implications of such knowledge for the attainment of enlightenment. Through a compara­tive analysis of Tsongkhapa and Gorampa on these issues, the manuscript"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEdemonstrates where, why, and how the two Tibetan readings of the original Indian sources exhibit distinct and independent characters.I have not set out to adjudicate which of the two readings gets the Indian sources right, but I do often juxtapose the two readings against some of the more obvious assertions made by the founding fathers of the tradition— such as the Buddha,4 Nagarjuna (ca. 150-250 c . e.) ,5 Aryadeva (ca. 170—270 c .e.),6 and Candraklrti (ca. 570-650 c .e.),7 giving readers the opportunity to draw their own conclusions.Chapter 1 of this book compares Tsongkhapas and Gorampas responses to three principal questions: What is divided into the two truths? How are they related? Are there two actual truths or just one truth? Examining his works in light of these questions reveals Tsongkhapa as a pluralist. For him the two truths are actual truths. Conventional truth and ultimate truth are mutually interlocking, with no hierarchical relation between them. Both truths are equal in their ontological, epistemological, and even soteriologi- cal importance. Gorampa, on the other hand, is a monist. Conventional truth, according to him, is not actual truth. Ultimate truth alone is the truth. Thus the two truths are distinct, hierarchically ordered, and mutu­ally exclusive. Ultimate truth precedes conventional truth in its ontologi­cal, epistemological, and soteriological importance.Chapter 2 compares the two Prasangika Madhyamikas’ interpretations of how the two truths are defined. For Tsongkhapa, definitions of the two truths are based on the two natures that are verified by, respectively, empir­ically valid and ultimately valid cognition. Tsongkhapa, however, does not simply reduce the two truths to these two modes of cognition; ultimate truth in particular, he says, cannot be metaphysically unconditioned— reducible to an independent and ultimate mode of cognition—even though it may be unconditioned epistemologically. For Gorampa, ignorance and wisdom respectively determine the character, and therefore the definition, of each of the two truths. The two truths are thus underlaid by, and reducible to, two conflicting modes of cognition. Ultimate truth is there­fore unconditioned metaphysically—it is defined by an independent and ultimate mode of cognition.Chapter 3 compares Tsongkhapas and Gorampas positions on the lim­its of language and conceptual thought. For Tsongkhapa ultimate truth is, to a certain extent, both effable and conceptually knowable, while for Gorampa it is ineffable and conceptually unknowable. Tsongkhapa argues for the possibility of valid conceptual cognition, therefore, and Gorampa argues against it."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION3Chapter 4 compares Tsongkhapa and Gorampa on the three principal modes of knowing ultimate truth: by way of not seeing it; by way of tran­scending conceptual elaborations; and by way of ascending to nonduality. Tsongkhapa mobilizes all three of these modes of knowing ultimate truth to establish that empirically given phenomena (those accessible to the senses) are without essence and thus dependently arisen.8 He then proceeds to argue that transcendent knowledge is equivalent to knowledge of empir­ical phenomena in being dependently arisen. Gorampa, on the other hand, mobilizes the three modes of knowing ultimate truth as epistemological scaffolding that allows one to ascend to a metaphysical nonduality. Tran­scendent knowledge, he argues, is utterly distinct from conventional know­ledge. Thus the knowledge of empirically given phenomena as dependently arisen and the knowledge of transcendent ultimate truth as nondual must be distinct and contradictory.The fifth chapter looks at the unique features of enlightened knowl­edge— the way a buddha’s mind works in relation to the two truths. This is where the disagreement between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa reaches its cli­max. Tsongkhapa argues that enlightenment is the perfection of knowledge of empirically given phenomena from both empirical and ultimate stand­points. Thus the two truths— and their two modes of knowing—are united in a perfect equilibrium. For Gorampa enlightenment represents a breach between the two truths, for with enlightenment the conventional world and conventional knowledge disappear, and one is conscious only of a transcen­dent absolute.The sixth and final chapter concludes the book with a discussion of the four main philosophical themes: soteriology, ontology, epistemology, and ethics.Why Compare Tsongkhapa and Gorampa?Tsongkhapa and Gorampa are two of the most widely read and respected figures within Tibetan philosophy. Their scholarship is respected not only within the schools to which each belonged but also among the larger philo­sophical community. In addition, their philosophical works are gaining increasing attention from contemporary interpreters. Both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa systematically formulated a complete Buddhist epistemolog­ical, ontological, and soteriological agenda based on their understandings of Indian Madhyamaka. Both rank the Prasangika Madhyamaka as the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEmost profound of all Buddhist philosophical schools. And, most impor­tantly, despite both claiming that their views are Prasangika Madhyamaka, their views are philosophically and hermeneutically distinct.Tsongkhapa is the founder of the Gelug (Dge lugs) order ofTibetan Bud­dhism. 9 He wrote extensively on Madhyamaka philosophy. His Lam rim chen mo (Great Stages of the Path}0 and Legs bshad snying po (Essence of Elo­quent Teachings)u are widely recognized as his two most illustrious works. His Dgongs pa rab gsal (Illumination of the Middle Way), a commentary on the Madhyamakavatara of Candraklrti, and his Rtsa she tik chen (Ocean of Reasoning), a commentary on the Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna, are the most celebrated of his commentarial works.12Gorampa is a pillar of the Sakya (Sa skya) school.13 Although not the founder of the Sakya order, his writings receive more attention than almost all other scholars of this tradition. In academic institutions affiliated with the Sakya school, Gorampas writings are compulsory textbooks. His most highly regarded writings include the two independent works, the Lta bdi shan ’byed (Distinguishing Views}4 and the Nges don rab gsal (Window on the Definitive Meaning). Among his commentaries are the Lta bdi ’odzer (Illumi­nating the View), his commentary on Nagarjunas Mulamadhyamakakarika, and the Lta ba ngan sel (Eliminating the Erroneous View), his commentary on Candraklrti s Madhyamakavatara.In their respective schools of thought, Tsongkhapa and Gorampa are rec­ognized as impeccable interpreters of Nagarjunas philosophy as transmit­ted through Buddhapalita and Candraklrti. However, from the perspective of the other’s school, the position of each is viewed as thoroughly problem­atic. A succession of Tibetan scholars— Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen (Rong ston Sakya rgyal tshan, 1367-1449), the translator Taktsang Lotsawa (Stag tsang Lo tsa ba, 1405-?), Gorampa (1429-89), Shakya Chogden (Sakya Mchog ldan, 1428-1509), the Eighth Karmapa Mikyo Dorje (Kar ma pa Mi skyod rdo rje, 1504-57), Mipham Rinpoche (Mi pham Rin po che, 1846-1912), Gendun Chopel (Dge ’dun chos ’phel, 1903-51), and others— have raised serious and fierce objections against Tsongkhapas position on the doctrine of the two truths. Likewise, Gyaltsab Je (Rgyal tshab Rje, 1364-1432), Khedrub Je (Mkhas grub Rje, 1385-1438), Gendun Drub (Dge ’dun grub, 1391-1474), Sera Jetsun Chokyi Gyaltsen (Se ra Rje tsun Chos kyi rgyal tshan, 1469-1544), Panchen Sonam Dragpa (Pan chen Bsod nams grags pa,1478-1554), Panchen Lobsang Chokyi Gyaltsen (Pan chen Bio bzang chos kyi rgyal tshan, 1567-1662), Jamyang Shepai Dorje (’Jam dbyangs Bzhad ba’i Rdo rje, 1648-1722), Changkya Rolpai Dorje (Lcang"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION5skya Rol pai rdo rje, 1717-86), Konchog Jigme Wangpo (Kon mchog ’jigs med dbang po, 1728-91), and others have vehemently defended Tsong­khapas interpretation while rejecting that of Gorampa.15This book attempts neither to reconcile Tsongkhapa and Gorampa nor to create any unnecessary division between the two. I have striven to pres­ent their philosophical approaches as accurately as I can, and there has been no deliberate intention on my part to adjudicate one view over the other. That said, readers should be aware, and may discern, that I personally found Tsongkhapas arguments more convincing. I like to think that my attrac­tion to Tsongkhapas view is due to its intrinsic virtues and not due to my own past training as a monk in the Gelug tradition. Readers will have to decide for themselves whether this preference is due more to my condition­ing or to the merits of the arguments at hand."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1. The Relationship Between the Two TruthsIntroductionTh is c h a p t e r examines the relationship between the two truths. It has three sections. The first section analyzes how the two truths are divided. The second section looks at how the two truths interact with one another. And the third section asks whether there are actually two truths.Technically speaking, the first section explores the basis of the division (dbye gzhiy jneya) into two truths. The precise identification of the basis of the division is critical for both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. For the former, it relates to his effort to maintain a compatibility between the two truths, while for the latter, it relates to his effort to maintain an irreducible differ­ence between them. As we will see, Tsongkhapa argues that “objects of knowledge” (shes bya) constitute the basis of the division, and he therefore grounds his exposition on the dual nature of empirically given phenomena. Gorampa argues that “mere mind” (bio tsam) constitutes the basis of the division, and he grounds his exposition on two opposing perspectives.The second section concerns the way in which the two truths are related. For Tsongkhapa, the two truths constitute a “single ontological identity” (ngo bogcig) with “different conceptual identities ” (Idogpa thadad)y whereas Gorampa argues that the truths are separate in a way that is “incompatible with their unity” (gcigpa bkagpa’i tha dad) or identity.Here two rather technical phrases provide the context for our examina­tion. The Tibetan phrase ngo bo gcig used in Tsongkhapas philosophy, par­ticularly in the context of the relationship between the two truths, is often translated in English as “one entity.”16 Although entity has some conno­tations of being, as pointed out in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, it usually refers to a thing.17 In Tsongkhapas sense, despite an underlying assumption that the two truths constitute one entity or one thing or one7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEphenomenon,, the ngo bo does not as such directly refer to a thing Even in ordinary Tibetan discourses, ngo bo does not have any explicit reference to things. There is however an implicit reference to things, since ngo bo always refers to the identity, nature, or the property of that thing.The Great Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary defines ngo bo as rangbzhin, mean­ing “nature,” or gnas lugs, meaning “mode of being.”18 It also explains ngo bo gcig pa as meaning “having natures that are not distinct, like [the two states of] being a jar and being impermanent.”19 Making it even clearer, the dictionary states that rang bzhin gcig pa, meaning “single nature,” and bdag nyid gcig pa, meaning “identical character,” are synonyms for ngo bo gcig pa, meaning “single ontological identity.”20 Thus, instead of “entity,” we will translate ngo bo as “ontological identity” and ngo bo gcig as “single ontolog­ical identity” or as “nature”21 interchangeably, depending on context. As we will see, the analysis of the relationship between the two truths for Tsong­khapa amounts to analyzing the relationship between the two natures.The second Tibetan phrase is Idogpa tha dad. This phrase is often trans­lated in English as “isolate,”22 or less frequently as “opposite”23 or “distin- guisher.”24 However, Idog pa is explained in the Great Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary as “a phenomenon that appears to the conceptual mind as being different categories...or it is that which appears not being different. For instance, the Idog pa of a jar is the aspect that is merely not being of the non­jar, like the form that appears to the conceptual mind.”25 Dreyfus, who translates Idog pa as “distinguishes” clarifies that the Idog pa of a phenom­enon “is its conceptual identity. It is the property of a phenomenon being not what it is not. For example, a jar is distinct from everything else [that is not jar]. This is explained by the Collected Topics to be its distinguishes Since such a distinguisher is a distinction made by thought, it is concep­tual.”26 Similarly, Dreyfus explains “when we think that the Vedic language is impermanent, we apply the distinguisher, that is, the concept of imper­manence, to the Vedic language.”27As these explanations reveal, Idog pa has more to do with conceptual identification than with the thing itself. To be closer to the meaning at issue here, although the translation is less literal, I tentatively use the term con­ceptual identity for the Tibetan phrase Idog pa. Ngo bo gcig la Idog pa tha dad is therefore tentatively rendered as “single ontological identity with differ­ent conceptual identities.” These two Tibetan phrases are conjunctly explained in the Great Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary as follows: “despite not having distinct natures, exist as separate conceptual identities. For example, [it is like the conceptual relationships between] a jar and an object of knowl­"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS9edge; being impermanent and things; people and their causal conditions, the five aggregates; and the like.”28The final issue to be taken up in this chapter is the question of whether there really are two truths. By applying the principle of “single ontological identity” with “different conceptual identities,” Tsongkhapa argues that there are two truths and that this is coherent. While declaring that the two truths are distinct and incompatible, Gorampa proposes that there is in fact only one truth.What Is Divided into the Two Truths?Jamyang Shepai Dorje (1648-1722) notes six different bases of the division asserted by non-Gelug scholars.29 They include (1) “mere appearance” (snang tsam), (2) “entities ranging from material form to omniscience” (gzugs nas mam mkhyen bar gyi ngo bo)y (3) “nonreified objects” (sgro ma btagspa’i yul)> (4) “unanalyzed objects” (ma rtags ma dpyadpaiyul), (5) “truth” (bden pa)> and (6) “unspecified basis.” Newland notes as many as seven different ways of positing the basis of the two truths among non- Gelug Madhyamikas:30 (1) truths, (2) all entities from form to omniscient consciousness, (3) mere appearances, (4) unanalyzed knowables, (5) phe­nomena, (6) perspectives, and (7) mere minds. These lists indicate that there is no unanimity among Tibetan Madhyamikas regarding the basis of the divisions of the two truths. Let us first turn to Tsongkhapas account.The Objects of Knowledge as the Basis of the DivisionAlthough Tsongkhapa is aware of the views of his predecessors, he main­tains that “objects of knowledge” (shes bya) are the basis for dividing the two truths.31 For him, this means that the two truths relate to two different objects of knowledge. This view, according to Helmut Tauscher, is also held by Chapa Chokyi Senge (Phya pa chos kyi seng ge, 1109-69). Chapa lays great emphasis on determining the two realities as “identical in nature and different with regard to the characteristic distinction.”32 Tauscher also rec­ognizes: “Equally, in Tsongkhapas Madhyamaka exegesis, the same deter­mination is of utmost importance.”33 Tsongkhapa however makes no reference to Chapa. Instead he heavily relies on the following statement of the Buddha from the Pitaputrasamdgama Sutra:"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"IOTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATE.. .The Tathagata understands both the empirical (kun rdzob)34 and the ultimate (don dam), for the objects of knowledge exhaustively comprise conventional and ultimate truths. Besides, the Bhagavan perfectly sees, perfectly understands, and thoroughly actualizes emptiness. Because of this, he is described as omniscient.35It also says:The knower of the universe taught these two truths without hearing from others. There is the empirical and likewise the ulti­mate. There can never be a third truth.36An object of knowledge is defined as “an object that is cognizable (bloiyul du bya rung ba). Whether a pillar, a jar, or any other phenomenon, it must be an object of cognition in general, [cognitions] ranging from those of [ordi­nary] sentient beings through to those of enlightened beings.”37 This defi­nition, Tsongkhapa agrees, attempts to capture any thing knowable in the broadest possible sense. Since the Buddha maintains knowledge of the two truths to be necessary for enlightenment, the understanding of the two truths must constitute an exhaustive understanding of all objects of knowledge.Tsongkhapa agrees with Gorampa that the doctrine of the two truths is pedagogically important in conveying the Buddhas message. Yet Tsong­khapa firmly believes that the Buddhas distinction between the two truths is not merely pedagogical. For Tsongkhapa, the most important reason for the division is to reveal that every empirically (tha snyad) or conventionally (kun rdzob) given phenomenon possesses dual natures: namely, the empiri­cal nature (or conventional nature) and the ultimate nature. Yet one is puta- tively described as false and deceptive while the other is described as true and nondeceptive. “The division of two truths,” as Hopkins puts it, “emphasizes two types of objects of consciousness, truths and falsities. Both, however, are falsely existent or falsely established because neither is independent; each depends on its imputing consciousness and on the other.”38Since both realities pertain to every phenomenon, the division of the two truths means the division of each phenomenon into two natures. Thus the division of the two truths, according to Tsongkhapa, “reveals that it makes sense to divide even the nature of a single entity, like a sprout, into dual natures—its empirical and its ultimate natures.” w He adds: “It does not"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHSIIhowever show that the one nature of the sprout is itself divided into two truths in relation to ordinary beings (so skye) and to aryas”AQThe division of the nature of each phenomenon into two, Tsongkhapa argues, does not contradict his own claim that the two truths constitute a single ontological identity with different conceptual identities. For Tsong­khapa, these two ideas are, in fact, interdependent and mutually support­ing. Without the twofold nature, there could not be a single ontological identity with different conceptual identities. Likewise, without the notion of a single ontological identity with distinct conceptual identities, a single phenomenon could not have multiple natures.How can the single ontological identity of a phenomenon be bifurcated into two distinct conceptual identities? It comes down to the way the sin­gle ontological identity appears to a cognizing consciousness—deceptively and nondeceptively. The two natures correspond to these deceptive or nondeceptive modes of appearance. While they both belong to the same ontological identity, they are epistemologically or conceptually mutually exclusive.41 Take a sprout for instance. If it exists, it necessarily exhibits a dual nature, and yet those two natures cannot be ontologically distinct. The ultimate nature of the sprout cannot be separate from its conventional nature—its color, texture, shape, extension, and so on. As an object of knowledge, the sprout retains its single ontological identity, but it is known through its two natures. These two natures exclude one another so far as knowledge is concerned. The mind that verifies the deceptive empirical nature of the sprout thus does not have direct access to its nondeceptive ulti­mate nature. Similarly, the mind that verifies the nondeceptive ultimate nature of the sprout does not have direct access to its deceptive empirical nature. Newland explains:A table and its emptiness are a single entity. When an ordinary conventional mind takes a table as its object of observation, it sees a table. When a mind of ultimate analysis searches for the table, it finds the emptiness of the table. Hence, the two truths are posited in relation to a single entity by way of the perspec­tives of the observing consciousness. This is as close as Ge-luk- bas will come to defining the two truths as perspectives.42It is important to recognize that, for Tsongkhapa, the two types of veri­fying consciousness do not imply two different individuals. A single cogni­tive agent is potentially capable of verifying both the truths. If the two"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEverifying consciousnesses belonged to two different individuals or types of individuals—empirically valid consciousness for an ordinary being and ultimately valid consciousness for an arya (as Gorampa would argue)— then the two verifying consciousnesses would conflict with each other. The former would constitute ignorance, while the latter would constitute wis­dom. Recognizing this, Newland also writes:These distinctions are critical to the Ge-luk-ba philosophical project, the preservation of non-paradoxical compatibility be­tween the two truths. The conventional mind that finds a table is not discredited by the ultimate mind that finds the emptiness of the table. The first is valid because the table (a conventional truth) does exist; the second is also valid because the tables real nature is an emptiness of inherent existence (an ultimate truth).43For Tsongkhapa, the two verifying consciousnesses stand on an equal footing; neither is superior to the other. Moreover, they may both belong to the same cognitive agent. In spite of their different roles, they are mutually entailing. You must realize their mutuality in order to realize both truths.Mere Mind as the Basis of the DivisionLet us now turn to Gorampas account of the basis of the division of the two truths. Gorampa outlines four bases of the division. They are:• mere mind (bio tsam)• mere interdependence (rten 1breltsam)• mere objects of knowledge (shes bya tsam)• mere subjects of the Buddhas discourses (gsungrabgyi brjod bya tsam)44In emphasizing the first basis of the division, mere mindy Gorampa rules out the possibility that the division has an objective basis. The distinctions between the two truths are purely subjective—a matter of mere mind. Closely connected to mere mind is the second possible basis, mere interde­pendence. Mere interdependence, in Gorampas usage, implies simply that the division of the two truths is dependent on two minds, ignorance and wisdom. In other words, were there no ignorance and wisdom, not only the distinction between the two truths, but also the two truths themselves, would not exist. Gorampas third basis is mere objects of knowledge. For him, all objects of knowledge except ultimate truth are thought constructs,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS13reifications of ignorance. Ultimate truth is none other than the transcen­dent wisdom itself. By suggesting that the basis of the division of the two truths is mere objects of knowledge, Gorampa avoids contradicting his ear­lier claim that the basis of the division of the two truths is mere mind. He claims that the Buddha taught conventional truth for purely pedagogical purposes. Hence, mere subjects of the Buddhas discourses is the fourth basis for the division of the two truths.Since all four options equally emphasize the subjective nature of the dis­tinction between the two truths, so, in Gorampas view, all four bases for the division are mutually compatible. “There is no conflict at all in positing either mere mind...[or] mere interdependence...[or] mere objects of knowledge... [or] mere subjects of the Buddhas discourses to all be the basis of the division,” says Gorampa.45 Nevertheless, Gorampa emphasizes mere mind and mere subjects of the Buddhas discourses. Of the former, he states: “Although there are not two truths in terms of the objects mode of existence (gnas tshul), the truths are divided into two in terms of [the contrasting per­spectives of] the mind that sees the mode of existence and the mind that does not see the mode of existence.. .This makes perfect sense.”46 The point here is to stress the subjective nature of the division. The division of the two truths cannot be grounded ontologically, for there is only one reality. The two truths are divided only according to the cognitive experiences of indi­viduals. He who sees only phenomena, according to Gorampa, is ignorant, and he who sees reality, rather than the phenomena, is wise. This is because he who sees phenomena is caught within the web of conceptual elaboration, and he who sees reality has transcended conceptual elaboration.Gorampa emphasizes the pedagogical necessity of the two truths. In dis­cussing mere subjects of the Buddha’s discourses us one basis for the division of the two truths, he says:[Besides, reality] cannot be revealed through linguistic expres­sions (sgra) in the context of the Madhyamaka literature. Yet it is nominally expressed through terms. The two truths, although indivisible, are presented to disciples as distinct. In this way, look­ing at the consistency of the whole [philosophical system], from the beginning until the end, I think [the subjects of the Buddhas discourses provide] a perfectly plausible [basis of the division] ,47Although all phenomena are entirely false and deceptive, with no grounding in reality, Gorampa asserts that the Buddha posited empirically"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEgiven phenomena as empirical truths for pedagogical reasons. Since ordi­nary beings are obsessed with empirical phenomena, the Buddha saw the practical application of positing empirical truth. He recognized its ultimate falsity, and yet saw its provisional utility as an instructional device to coax his disciples beyond the phenomenal realm.In terms of the way things exist (gnas tsul'), one cannot distin­guish between characteristic and characterized, the basis of divi­sion and the divided, and the like. However, when empirical truth is fabricated (sgro brtags pa) as an instructional device for disciples, it is important to consider the basis of division like the divided components.48As far as Gorampa is concerned, the Buddha teaches about empirical truth simply as a means to lead ordinary beings into the ultimate realm from the delusional worldly realm. The empirical world, according to this view, provides purely instrumental rather than actual truth. This interpre­tation of the two truths is common among contemporary academics as well. “A relative or conventional truth (samvrtisatya),” as Lindtner puts it, “serves as the means for obtaining the absolute or ultimate truth (paramdrthasatya,A”49 He explicitly echoes Gorampas view by stating “the theory of satyadvaya is above all a pedagogical device.”50In discussing the pedagogical necessity of the two truths, Gorampa par­aphrases his earlier statement regarding mere mind as the basis of the divi­sion. He writes that “based on the subjective consciousness (yulcangyi bio), truth is twofold: empirical truth and ultimate truth.”51 Although this rein­forces his preference for the subjective (yul can) division of the two truths over the objective (yul), it does not expressly reject an objective reference for the division. But then Gorampa writes: “Here in the Madhyamaka litera­ture, it is not coherent to divide the object per se into the two truths.”52 In his commentary on the Madhyamakavatara, he writes, “A basis perse is sep­arated in terms of its modes of appearance. Otherwise—in terms of the object— there is no division.”53 Since empirical phenomena are entirely false and deceptive, the division between the two truths cannot apply to empirical phenomena themselves—what is false and deceptive cannot be divided into the deceptive and the nondeceptive. Gorampa forcefully sum­marizes his view:Here in the M adhyam aka system, the object itself cannot be divided into two truths. Empirical truth and ultimate1 truth arc"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS15divided in terms of the modes of apprehension (mthong tshul)— in terms of the subject apprehending falsehood and the subject apprehending truth; or mistaken and unmistaken apprehensions Ckhrul ma :khrul); or deluded or undeluded apprehensions (rmongs ma rmongs); or erroneous or nonerroneous apprehen­sions (phyin ci log ma log); or valid or invalid cognitions (tshad ma yin min).54And he adds:Because two truths are posited in terms of the subjective con­sciousness depending on whether it is deluded (rmongs) or non­deluded (ma rmongs), a perception of falsity (brdzun pa thong ba) or a perception of reality (yang dag mthong ba), and mistaken (khrul) or unmistaken (ma khrul), the position of [the truths] in terms of the subjective consciousness is unanimously accepted by all Prasangikas and Svatantrikas of India.55It is worth underlining the two points at issue here. Since the minds of ordinary beings are always deluded, mistaken, and erroneous, they falsely experience conventional truth. Conventional truth is thus posited only in relation to the perspective of ordinary beings. Ordinary beings always assume the sensory experiences of empirical entities as veridical, despite the fact that they are utterly false. However, since the wisdom of aryas’ medita­tive equipoise and enlightened minds is never mistaken, always nonde­luded, and nonerroneous, aryas flawlessly experience ultimate truth. Ultimate truth is thus posited strictly in relation to an aryas or a buddhas perspective.Other Tibetans who maintain Gorampas line of argument on the basis of the division of the two truths are Longchen Rabjam (1308-63),56 Sakya Pandita (1182-1251),57 Mipham Rinpoche,58 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,59 Taktsang Lotsawa,60 Shakya Chogden,61 and Mikyo Dorje.62 They all agree with Gorampa that the distinctions between the two truths are merely sub­jective. Generally speaking, they all argue that the two truths are reducible to the two conflicting perspectives, namely, ignorance and wisdom. Modern scholars, including T.R.V. Murti,63 La Valine Poussin,64 Jaideva Singh,65 Christian Lindtner, and C.W. Huntington,66 also endorse a similar interpre­tation. Guy Newland confirms that “Many Western scholars hold that the two truths are not two types of object, but rather two viewpoints, perspec-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"16THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEtives, or types of consciousnesses” and goes on to give several examples from the writing of Frederick Streng.67As we have already seen, according to Tsongkhapa, the object of knowl­edge as that which can be known by means of two different modes of cog­nition, each of which may be verified by the same cognizing agent, is the basis of the division of the two truths. The key point ofTsongkhapa’s argu­ment is that every empirically given object of knowledge consists of dual natures—conventional and ultimate—that form the objective basis of the two truths. Despite the fact that the different cognitions corresponding to the two natures engage with the same phenomenon, it is this objective basis that differentiates Tsongkhapas view from the subjective division of the two truths advanced by Gorampa. Therefore, as Hopkins puts it, “there are stan­dards and criteria for valid establishment, and in this sense both suchness and the phenomena qualified by it are objective.”68While Tsongkhapa thus distances himself from the subjective division of the two truths, Gorampa attempts to demonstrate the validity of his view by arguing that mere mind provides the primary basis for the division of the two truths. Unlike Tsongkhapa, Gorampa holds that the two truths do not have any objective basis. Instead they are entirely reducible to the experi­ences of the deluded minds of ordinary beings and the experiences of the wisdom of aryas.There is one last crucial point to be emphasized before we move to the next section. According to Tsongkhapa, the agent who cognizes the two truths may be one and the same individual. Each agent has all the requisite cognitive resources that are potentially capable of accessing both truths. Ordinary beings have only conceptual access to ultimate truth, while aryas, who are in the process of learning, have direct, but intermittent, access. Enlightened beings, however, invariably have simultaneous access to both truths. The view held by Gorampa argues for separate cognitive agents cor­responding to each of the two truths. Ordinary beings have direct access to conventional truth, but are utterly incapable of accessing ultimate truth. The aryas in training have direct access to both ultimate and conventional truths. Buddhas, on the other hand, only have access to ultimate truth. They have no access to conventional truth whatsoever from the enlightened perspective. (See chapter 5 for a detailed treatment of the issue.)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS17How Are the Two Truths Related?Two important background issues should be borne in mind at this stage. Central to Tsongkhapas account of the relationship between the two truths is his emphasis on the relationship between the “two natures of a single entity.” He thus implicitly suggests that the two truths constitute one and the same phenomenon (or entity or thing)—they do not, in any way, rep­resent two ontologically distinct identities. Tsongkhapas primary aim is therefore to establish the mutually compatible relationship between two modes of cognition that relate to the two natures of a single phenomenon or entity. In other words, for Tsongkhapa the two modes of cognition and the two natures corresponding to the two truths are underlaid by one phe­nomenon. Gorampa, however, views the relationship between the two truths as one between two distinct and incompatible modes of cognition, of which only the ultimate refers to a real phenomenon.The Two Truths Are Ontologically Identical but Conceptually DistinctThe principle of single ontological identity with distinct conceptual iden­tities, mentioned earlier, is founded on the concept of the two natures. This concept not only serves as the basic reference point for Tsongkhapa in his exposition of the basis of the division of the two truths, their meanings and definitions, but also serves as the basic ontological reference for his account of the relationship between the two truths.Tsongkhapa traces the notion of the two natures back to Candraklrti. “[The Buddha] said that all things have two natures—those found by per- ceivers of reality and of falsities,” says Candraklrti in the Madhyamakava- tara.69 While glossing the statement in the Madhyamakdvatdrabhdsyay Candraklrti also writes: “All phenomena—interior and exterior—such as conditioned phenomena and the sprout, have two natures.”70 Khedrub Je (1385-1438) rephrases it this way: “As both the root texts of the [Madhya- makavatara]and its commentary maintain...all conventional and ultimate phenomena possess natures, and if their natures exist they must be either one or different. For if [two natures] exist they must be either the same or differ­ent.”71 Since the dual natures are ontologically locked together within the framework of each phenomenon, it is obvious that the two truths constitute the same phenomenon. Therefore the question concerning the relationship between the two truths is the same as that concerning the relationship"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"i8THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEbetween the two natures. To establish the relationship between the two truths is thus equivalent to examining the precise relationship between the two natures.So, how are the two natures related? Are they identical or distinct?72 For Tsongkhapa the short answer is that the two natures are neither identical nor distinct in any unqualified sense. They are related in terms of a single ontological identity with distinct conceptual identities—thus they are both the same and different. Since the two natures are the basis of the relation­ship between the two truths, the relationship between the two truths will reflect the relationship between the two natures. Ultimate truth and con­ventional truth thus possess the same ontological status. As the two natures are of the same ontological structure, so the two truths relate to the same ontological structure also.Tsongkhapa likens the relationship between the two truths and the two natures to the relationship between being conditioned and being imperma­nent.73 He borrows this point from Nagarjunas Bodhicittavivarana, which states: “Reality is not perceived as separate from conventionality. The con­ventionality is explained to be empty. Empty alone is the conventionality,” and therefore, for Nagarjuna, “if one of them does not exist, neither will the other, like being conditioned and being impermanent.”74 Commenting on this passage from the Bodhicittavivarana, Tsongkhapa writes:The first four lines show that things as they really are, are not ontologically distinct from that of the conventionality. The lat­ter two lines establish their relationship such that if one did not exist, neither could the other (med na mi hung bdi ’brel ba).This, in fact, is equivalent to their being constituted by a single- property relationship (bdag cigpai 1brel ba). Therefore, like the case of being conditioned and being impermanent, [the relation between the two truths] is demonstrated as one of a single onto­logical identity.75The way in which the two truths are related is thus analogous to the rela­tionship between being conditioned and being impermanent. Insofar as the character of being conditioned and being impermanent is concerned, they are ontologically identical and mutually entailing. Whatever is impermanent is also conditioned, likewise whatever is conditioned is also impermanent. If impermanence did not exist, conditioned phenomena would not exist, and vice versa. Just as a conditioned state is not a result of impermanence, so"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS19emptiness is not a result of form or the destruction of form—hence in the Vimalakirtinirdesa Sutra it is stated: “Matter itself is void. Voidness does not result from the destruction of matter, but the nature of matter is itself void­ness.”76 The same principle applies in the case of consciousness and the emptiness of consciousness, as well as to the rest of the five psychophysical aggregates—the aggregate and its emptiness are not causally related. For the causal relationship would imply either the aggregate is the cause, therefore its emptiness is the result, or the aggregate is the result, and its emptiness the cause. This would imply either the aggregate or the emptiness is tem­porally prior to its counterpart, thus leading to the conclusion that the aggregate and its emptiness exist independently of each other. Such a view is completely unacceptable to Tsongkhapa.The ontological identity between being conditioned and being imperma­nent does not imply identity in all and every respect. Insofar as their mode of appearance is concerned, conditioned and impermanent phenomena are distinct and contrasting. Impermanence always presents itself to the cogniz­ing mind as impermanent, but not as conditioned. Similarly, being condi­tioned always presents itself to its cognizing mind as conditioned, but not as impermanent. Thus it does not necessarily follow that the two truths are identical in every respect just because they share a common ontological iden­tity. Where the modes of appearance are concerned, ultimate nature and conventional nature are distinct. The mode of appearance of ultimate nature is nondeceptive and consistent with its mode of existence, while that of con­ventional nature is deceptive and inconsistent with its mode of existence.Conventional nature is uncritically verified by empirical valid cognition, whereas ultimate nature is critically verified by ultimately valid cognition. Hence, just as ultimate nature is inaccessible to the empirically valid cogni­tion for its uncritical mode of engagement, so, too, is conventional nature inaccessible to ultimately valid cognition for its critical mode of engage­ment. This is how, in Tsongkhapas view, the truths differ conceptually despite sharing a common ontological identity.In summarizing Tsongkhapas points, Khedrub Je writes: “The two truths are therefore of the same nature, but different conceptual identities. They have a single-nature relationship such that, if one did not exist, nei­ther could the other, just like being conditioned and impermanent.”77 In commenting on Gelug thought, Newland also upholds the same point:That the two truths are different isolates means, for example,that a table and its emptiness can be distinguished in terms of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEhow they are understood by a conceptual consciousness. To say that two things are different isolates is to make only the most minimal distinction between them. Since conceptual conscious­nesses often operate under the sway of language, things are dif­ferent isolates as soon as they are given different names— even if those names refer to the same object.78Since the meaning of distinct conceptual identities (Idog pa tha dad)y in Tsongkhapas view, is rooted in the two natures, the conceptual distinction between the two truths must not be understood as a pure epistemological distinction. This distinction, according to Tsongkhapa, is not reducible to two different perspectives, or even to two different linguistic practices. Since both truths have their own objective references, namely, the two natures, they are not reducible to subjective viewpoints, nor are they reducible to merely a difference of language. Jose Cabezon is one commen­tator who does hold the distinction between the two truths as entirely lin­guistic, writing that the two truths,4 although having the same referent... have different names, different designations, being the opposites of differ­ent entities qua names.”79 Both Newland and Cabezon are correct in point­ing out that distinct conceptual identities in Tsongkhapas sense are distinctions drawn by the conceptual consciousness, and so clearly have a linguistic component. They are also correct in pointing out, as I have above, that the two truths have only one entity or one phenomenon as their refer­ent. Yet to then say that the differences between the two truths are purely linguistic in nature is to ignore Tsongkhapas own emphasis on the role of the two natures corresponding to the two truths. The distinction between those two natures is not merely linguistic.Although the two truths presuppose, according to Tsongkhapa, a single phenomenon or entity as their common referent, this does not mean that they share exactly the same objective referent. Ultimate truth has the ulti­mate nature of the phenomenon as its referent, while conventional truth has the conventional nature of the same phenomenon as its referent. Thus, while engaging with the same phenomenon, both verifying conscious­nesses have their own distinctive referents according to their modus oper- andi—one critically, the other uncritically. This is a central thesis of Tsongkhapa, allowing him to ground both the identity and difference that stem from the relationship between the two truths on the single ontologi­cal identity and different conceptual natures of a single phenomenon. In doing this, he effectively dismisses the idea of treating the difference"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS21between the truths as merely one of contradictory perspectives or different linguistic practices. Thus he accords equal significance to both the episte­mological and ontological issues involved in the relationship between the two truths. To say that they share a single ontological identity with differ­ent conceptual identities does not mean, therefore, that the distinctions at issue are purely epistemological. This is consistent with his position that the two truths have equal status and do not constitute an ontological or epistemological hierarchy.The Two Truths Are Distinct and IncompatibleLet us now examine how Gorampa formulates the relationship between the two truths. From his perspective, the position advanced by Tsongkhapa is utterly unacceptable. To say that the two truths are ontologically identical is similar to equating ignorance with wisdom. Jay Garfield precisely antic­ipates Gorampas general approach to the doctrine of the two truths when he writes:By distinguishing the conventional from the ultimate, it is tempting to disparage the former in contrast to the latter, devel­oping a sort of theory of one truth and one falsehood. This is done if one reifies the entities associated with the ultimate, such as emptiness or impermanence or the Four Noble Truths, or the Buddha. Then one treats these as real, intrinsically existent phe­nomena. The conventional then become the world of illusion.80As we saw above, the main point of reference in Gorampas exposition of the basis of the two truths is what he calls “mere mind,” since this is what underpins the view that the distinction between the two truths is purely subjective. Moreover, because Gorampa denies that there is any ontological unity that underlies the distinction between the two truths—that the dis­tinction is one of mere mind, such that the two truths cannot both have an objective referent—the two truths must constitute conflicting and incom­patible perspectives. According to this view, then, the relationship between the two truths is equivalent to the relationship between the two conflicting perspectives—namely, ignorance and wisdom. The question now arises: How is ignorance related to wisdom? Or conversely, how does wisdom relate to ignorance? In answer, Gorampa suggests four possible sets of relation­ships between the two truths. He derives them from Sakya Pandita:"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEGenerally the twofold division is analyzed in order to determine (i) whether its members are substantially distinct (rdzas tha dad), like a mattress and a jar, (2) or [to determine whether they are] a single identity with distinct conceptual identities, like being con­ditioned and impermanent, (3) or co-referential but different in meaning (rnamsgrangspa’i tha dad), like “moon” and “that which has a cooling effect” (hsil zer byedpa), (4) or distinct in the sense that is incompatible with oneness, like entity and without entity.This [relationship] between the two truths also has to be ana­lyzed in this way.81Among these four sets of relations, Gorampa ignores the first—substan­tially distinct—and the third—co-referential, but different in meaning. The second type of relationship—single ontological identity with distinct conceptual identities—is the one advocated by Tsongkhapa, and Gorampa rejects it (we will turn to his objections shortly). His own account is based on the fourth type of relation—that the two truths are distinct in the sense that they are incompatible with unity, like entity and without entity.For Gorampa the relationship between the two truths is quite straight­forward. In the ultimate sense, he argues, the two truths transcend identity and difference.82 “The transcendence of identity and difference from the ultimate standpoint is synonymous with the transcendence of identity and difference from the purview of the aryas meditative equipoise.”83 However, from the empirical standpoint, he claims that the two truths are distinct in the sense that they are incompatible with their unity. He likens this rela­tionship to the one between entity and without entity.84Gorampas claim that the two truths are distinct and incompatible encompasses both ontological and epistemological distinctions. Since what is divided into the two truths is mere mind, it is obvious that there is no sin­gle phenomenon that could serve as the objective referent for both. This also means that the two truths must be construed as corresponding to dis­tinct spheres belonging to distinct modes of consciousness: conventional truth corresponds to ignorance and ultimate truth to wisdom. It is thus inappropriate to describe the relationship between the two truths, and their corresponding modes of consciousness, in terms of two ways of perceiving the same entity. Although the two truths can be thought of as two ways of perceiving, one based on ignorance and the other on wisdom, there is no same entity perceived by both. There is nothing common between the two truths, and if they are both ways of perceiving, then they do not perceive the same thing."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Gorampas formulation of the distinct and incompatible relationship between the two truths is also reinforced by his objections launched against the notion that the two truths share a common ontological identity. One of these objections states that:85If the two truths were identical in their natures, then metaphor­ically speaking, the hairs seen through blurred vision and the nonexistence of hairs seen through correct vision would absurdly become identical. This would follow from the two truths being identical in their natures.86According to this view, the relationship between conventional truth and ultimate truth is analogous to the relationship between the appearance of falling hairs when vision is impaired by cataracts and the absence of such hairs when vision is unimpaired. Although this is a metaphor, it has a direct application to determining the relationship between the two truths. Con­ventional truth is like seeing falling hairs as a result of cataracts: both con­ventional truth and such false seeing are illusory, in the ontological sense that there is nothing to which each corresponds, and in the epistemologi- cal sense that there is no true knowledge in either case. Ultimate truth is therefore analogous, ontologically and epistemologically, to the true seeing unimpaired by cataracts and free of the appearance of falling hairs. Just as cataracts give rise to illusory appearances, so ignorance, according to Gorampa, gives rise to all conventional truths; wisdom, on the other hand, gives rise to ultimate truth. As each is the result of a different state, there is no common link between them in terms of either an ontological identity or an epistemological or conceptual identity.For Gorampa the idea that the two truths refer to one ontological iden­tity with different conceptual identities is highly problematic. It is equiva­lent to claiming that there is an ontological identity between the falling hairs seen as a result of cataracts and their absence when no cataracts are present. The same reasoning applies to any claim that the two truths share an epistemological link. Gorampa further rejects the identity of the two truths by relying on the Samdhinirmocana Sutra. This sutra, according to him, exposes four absurdities in claiming that the two truths are ontologi­cally identical.87 If the two truths were identical, then:[i] Just as the childish directly perceive conventional things such as form and sound, they would absurdly directly perceive ulti­mate truth. |2| Just as conventional [truth] comprises manyTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS 23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEdivisions of categories, such as form and sound, even so, ultimate [truth] would absurdly comprise many divisions. [3] Just as con­ventional [truth] by definition has the nature of deluded igno­rance, ultimate truth would [absurdly] be the same. [4] Just as conventional meaning is not sought apart from what is seen by the childish, ultimate truth would absurdly be the same.88By reading the Samdhinirmocana Sutra as presenting the relationship between the two truths as distinct and incompatible, Gorampa does not mean to suggest that the two truths constitute two distinct entities. Nor does he propose that the two truths are one entity seen under two conflict­ing aspects. There are two grounds for this: First, the basis of the divisions of the two truths is mere mind, and it is not coherent to divide mind into two distinct entities. Second, all entities are classified as belonging to con­ventional truth, while ultimate truth is purely “without entity.”If the two truths were really two distinct entities, then, Gorampa argues, they would give rise to a second set of absurdities, also four in number, as set out in the Samdhinirmocana Sutra:.. .if the two truths were distinct [entities], then: [1] Aryas, while directly realizing ultimate [truth], absurdly would remain unre­leased (mi grolba) from the conventional bondage (kun rdzob kyi 'ching ba). [2] Reality—that is, ultimate [truth]—would not be conventional phenomena’s universal characteristic (spyi tshan nyidy samdnya-laksana). [3] Either conditioned phenomena (du byed)y i.e., conventionalities, would remain unestablished, or selflessness would absurdly not be the ultimate truth. [4] The continuum of each person would absurdly accommodate both afflictive characteristics and liberating qualities.89This second quartet of absurd consequences shows, according to Gorampa, that the two truths are not utterly distinct entities even though they they are distinct and incompatible perspectives—perspectives that are in no way convergent.While Tsongkhapa himself does not explicitly cite the Samdhinirmocana Sutray his view is diametrically opposed to Gorampas interpretation of the passage. In Tsongkhapas view, the first four absurdities do not support the position that treats the two truths as equivalent— i.e., as identical in every respect. Instead, these absurdities expose the problems inherent in any such"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"identification. Many later Gelug scholars do refer to the passage and, just as Gorampa did, harnass the four absurdities to settle the issue of whether the two truths are equivalent. Consider the example of Khensur Pema Gyaltsen (Mkhan zur Pad ma rgyal mtshan), who writes:If the two truths [not only have a single ontological identity but] a single conceptual identity, then [i] common beings would directly realize the ultimate reality; [2] the awareness of that real­ity would generate delusions such as attachment; [3] that [real­ity] would be comprised of colors, shapes, and so forth, and [4] a yogis efforts to meditate on reality would absurdly be point­less. This would follow because a jar and its ultimate reality would fall under a single conceptual identity.90On the issue of whether the two truths are distinct, both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa differ from their predecessor, Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (Dol po pa Shes rab rgyal tshan, 1292-1361), the founder of the Jonang school,91 who argues in favor of a marked distinction. According to Kapstein, Dolpopas view represents perhaps the most radical division between the two truths in the Tibetan tradition. Kapstein considers the following remarks from Dolpopas Bden gyis gsal bdi nyi ma:The defining characteristic of relative truth is that it is an object of consciousness that in its fundamental nature is itself essentially empty of veridical being, while the defining characteristic of absolute truth is that it is an object of authentic, sublime gnosis that in its fundamental nature is itself essentially not empty of veridical being...Because the relative does not exist in fact, it is intrisically empty, and appears to consciousness but not to gnosis. Because the absolute exists in fact, it is not intrinsically empty, but is extrinsically empty, and appears to gnosis but never at all to consciousness...Thus, to those who are childish, according to their own dis­positions, only inauthentical characteristics appear, but not the authentic suchness, and in the same way, to the bodhisattvas, according to their own dispositions, only the authentic appears, but not what is inauthentic.92THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS 25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"2 6THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEKapstein argues that in Dolpopas view, “the nature of absolute is such that relative reality is in some sense wholly other with respect to it.”93 Dolpopa argues that the two truths are fundamentally separate and there­fore incompatible with their unity (gcigpa bkagpdi tha dad).Neither Tsongkhapa nor Gorampa agree with such a marked ontological separation. Such a view of the two truths, “far from revealing to us a sote- riologically valuable dialectic,” Kapstein points out, “leaves us with the unedifying vision of two mutually exclusive, but somehow compresent, orders of being, in which our discovery of a higher truth does nothing to overcome our previous unknowing.”94 Furthermore, Khedrub Je con­cludes, “If the two truths are ontologically distinct, they must be distinct unrelated things, because ontologically distinct things cannot have a single­character relationship.”95 But such a single-character relationship is essen­tial for the unity of the two truths. Here, too, later Gelug scholars turn to the Samdhinirmocana Sutra96 to reinforce their position. For example, Khensur Pema Gyaltsen further expounds on the four absurdities that would follow were the two truths entirely distinct:[i] A jar s emptiness of true existence would not be the jars mode of existence; [2] the realization of a jars emptiness of true exis­tence would not eradicate the reification through the conception of true existence; [3] it would make no sense to say that a jar is the basis of the repudiation of the true existence of the jar and so forth; and [4] the fact that an arya buddhas continuum does not simultaneously accommodate both—the wisdom realizing the emptiness and the grasping at true existence of a jar—would become absurd. This would follow if the jar and the jars empti­ness of true existence are distinct.97The assumption here is that the radical dualism proposed by Dolpopa, as Kapstein remarks, “effectively underwrites the metaphysical equivalence, while undermining the identity, of the two truths.”98Although these four absurdities are here employed to argue against the view that takes the two truths to be utterly distinct, this is not an argument that directly concerns Gorampa. He is not interested in demonstrating such a radical division of the two truths; rather he seeks to prove that they con­stitute two distinct perspectives. Tsongkhapa and the other Gelug scholars, however, by drawing attention to these absurdities, are aiming implicitly at establishing the mutual interdependence of the two truths."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS27Other Tibetan scholars, including Longchen Rabjam,\" Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,100 Mipham Rinpoche,101 and Gendiin Chopel, come closer to Gorampas view the way the two truths are distinct. Gendiin Chopel, for example,102 in criticizing Tsongkhapa for holding that there is a noncontra­dictory relationship between the two truths, writes:The so-called mutually compatible relationship between the two truths might be possible if there were ever a time whereby the aryas wisdom and the conception of ordinary beings become mutually compatible without contradiction. Otherwise, such [a relationship] is utterly impossible.. .There is indeed no opportu­nity to attain liberation for those who hold conventional and ultimate [truths] as noncontradictory. [This also holds true] in terms of the modes of analysis of both the truths.103He also states:This implies the acceptance of the mutually compatible and the noncontradictory relationship between the mental states of the naive ordinary beings— the lowest foolishness—and the enlight­ened knowledge—the highest erudition. If by accepting this, it did [justice to the enlightened wisdom], then there should be no problem even in accepting the mutually compatible relationship between the objects of ignorance and reasoning consciousness (i.e., an aryas’ wisdom), [would there?]. I.In short, the view that holds the two truths as noncontradictory is a philosophical sys­tem that accepts all categories of mental states from buddhas down to sentient beings as noncontradictory.104Still others such as Sakya Pandita,105 Rendawa (Red mda ba, 1349- 1412),106 Shakya Chogden,107 and Karmapa Mikyo Dorje108 argue that the relationship between the two truths is essentially inexpressible. They claim that ultimately the two truths transcend the notion of identity and differ­ence (gcigdang tha dadsprospa dang bral ba), and, conventionally, their rela­tionship is not expressible as either identical or distinct (de nyiddanggzhan du brjoddu med).mIn short, the two accounts we are considering here differ markedly in their views regarding the relationship between the two truths. Tsongkhapa insists that the two truths constitute a single ontological structure and that"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthey share a common ontological identity, while denying that the two truths are identical in every respect. They are different in their mode of appearance and their mode of existence. The appearance of conventional truth does not cohere with its mode of existence (its appearance belying its contingency), whereas the appearance of ultimate truth is coherent with its mode of existence (its noncontingency being apparent). Conventional and ultimate truth differ, then, in terms of the two natures upon which they are founded, and therefore also to their respective cognizing consciousnesses.The identity and difference of the two truths must, according to Tsong­khapa, be both ontologically and epistemologically grounded in the two natures. This renders the reduction of the two truths to a mere subjective distinction impossible, since the two natures do not constiutute a merely subjective distinction. In contrast, Gorampas account of the relationship between the two truths takes them to be reducible to two conflicting per­spectives. The cognitive experiences of ordinary beings and the cognitive experiences of buddhas are distinct in every possible sense. There is noth­ing in common between these two conflicting perspectives, including any common ontological identity or epistemological link.The divergence in Tsongkhapa and Gorampas views regarding the rela­tionship between the two truths will become more apparent as we delve fur­ther into the topic. In the following section, we will compare their views in relation to the authority of the two truths: are there really two truths or is there just one?Two Truths or One Truth?For Tsongkhapa the truth is always twofold while for Gorampa it is always single. The disagreement between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa regarding the basis of the division between the two truths is fundamental to this debate. For Tsongkhapa, since the two natures of every empirically given phenom­enon provide the ontological and epistemological foundation for each of the truths, the division of truth into two is entirely appropriate. Both the conventional and the ultimate are actual truths, and since the two natures are mutually interlocking, neither of the two truths has primacy over the other—both have equal status, ontologically, epistemologically, and even soteriologically. For Gorampa, however, truth per se is not divisible into two. Since mere mind provides the basis of the division of the two truths wherein ultimate truth— namely, wisdom—alone is seen as convincingly"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS29satisfying the criterion of truth, so conventional truth—namely, igno­rance—cannot properly be taken as truth. Wisdom and ignorance are invariably contradictory, and thus the two truths cannot coexist. Gorampa argues, in fact, that conventional truth must be eliminated in the ascent to ultimate truth. Given wisdoms primacy over ignorance, in the final analy­sis it is ultimate truth alone that must prevail without its merely conven­tional counterpart. Ultimate truth is therefore infinitely more significant than conventional truth in all respects—ontologically, epistemologically, and soteriologically.How Is Conventional Truth “Truth” at All?Given his stance on conventional truth as actual truth and his argument for the equal status of the two truths, Tsongkhapa must now address the ques­tion: How can conventional truth, which is described as false and decep­tive, be truth at all? In other words, how can the two truths be of equal status if conventional truth is false? Since Tsongkhapa grounds both truths in the dual nature of a single phenomenon, then “just as the ultimate reality of the sprout [for instance] is taken as characteristic of the sprout, hence it is described as the sprouts nature, so, too,” argues Tsongkhapa, “are the sprouts color, shape, etc., the sprouts characteristics. Therefore they too are its nature.”110 Since the two natures are ontologically mutually entailing, the sprout s ultimate truth cannot exist without its conventional truth, and vice versa. In other words, neither truth could exist without the other.In the interests of preserving a compatible relationship between the two truths, it is crucial for Tsongkhapa to demonstrate their equal footing. To this end, he appropriates Nagarjuna’s arguments establishing the unity between the two truths. In the Mulamadhyamakakdrika, particularly in chapter 24, Nagarjuna offers his most explicit statements on the unity of the two truths by advancing two separate arguments, one emphasizing their epistemological link, and the other emphasizing their ontological unity. Both these lines of argument draw upon an understanding of the connec­tion between conventional truth and dependent arising on the one hand, and between ultimate truth and emptiness on the other.Firstly, in order to articulate the epistemological link between the two truths, Nagarjuna states: “Without relying upon empirical [truth], the meaning of the ultimate cannot be explained. Without understanding the meaning of the ultimate, nirvana is not attained.”111 Similarly, “To whom­soever emptiness makes sense, everything [the four noble truths] makes"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEsense. To whomsoever emptiness makes no sense, everything makes no sense.”112 In the Vigrahavyavartani, Nagarjuna phrases this point slightly differently: “Wherever emptiness is possible, there every function is possi­ble. Wherever emptiness is not possible, there every function is not possi­ble.”113 Secondly, in order to demonstrate the ontological unity between the two truths, in the Mukmadhyamakakdrika^d^fxxn^ writes: “Whatever is dependently arisen, is itself explained to be empty. That being dependently designated, is itself the middle path.”114 In the Vigrahavyavartani Nagar­juna attributes this same point to the Buddha: “I pay homage to this peer­less Buddha, who perfectly explained that the identity of meaning of emptiness and dependent arising constitutes the middle path.”115 More explicitly, he argues that “There is no thing that is not dependently arisen; therefore, there is no thing that is not empty.”116In the Madhyamakavatara, Candraklrti reinforces the unity between the two truths by emphasizing the causal efficacy of empty phenomena. “It is not a secret that empty entities like reflections and so forth depend on aggregation (of causes and conditions), and a consciousness may arise in the form of an image of such an empty reflection.”117 Moreover, he argues that “All entities are, in the similar characteristics, not only empty [as effects], but they are produced out of empty [causal conditions].”118 This must fol­low “because there is no essence whatsoever from the standpoints of both truths”; hence all entities, according to Candraklrti, “are neither permanent nor subject to annihilation.”119Tsongkhapa supports this view of Nagarjuna and Candraklrti that empty phenomena and dependently arisen phenomena are synonymous. The con­cept of emptiness is incoherent unless it is applied to dependently arisen phenomena, and equally the concept of dependent arising is incoherent unless it is applied to empty phenomena. In the Rten 1brelstodpa (In Praise ofDependent Arising), Tsongkhapa mobilizes his arguments to reinforce the unity between the two truths:According to you [i.e., the Buddha], since emptiness means dependent arising, the emptiness of essence and the efficacy of action and its agent are not contradictory. If emptiness, however, is seen as contradictory with [dependent arising], there would be neither action in empty [phenomena], nor empty [phenomena] in action. This way, you accept that one falls in a precipice of despair.120... Since there is no phenomenon other than whar is depend-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS31ently arisen, there is no phenomenon other than what is empty of essence.121.. .The “utter nonexistence of essence” and making sense of everything in the light of the principle “this arises depending on this”— there is indeed no need to say that they are noncontradictory.122.. .Therefore, despite the fact that whatever is dependently arisen is primordially devoid of essence, it nonetheless appears. [Phenomena] all are thus proclaimed as illusion-like.123In the Lam gtso mam gsum (The Three Principal Pathways), Tsongkhapa varies his argument slightly to establish this unity. “Appearance avoids the extreme of existence, and empty [phenomena] avoids the extreme of nonex­istence. Hence by understanding that the empty [phenomenon] itself is the bearer of cause and effect, one is not robbed by the extreme view.”124 As indicated in Nagarjuna and Candraklrtis arguments, the efficacy of empty phenomena, the bearers of cause and effect, is particularly significant to this view. The idea of empty phenomena acting as the basis of cause and effect is crucial in understanding Tsongkhapas view of the inextricable relation­ship between ultimate truth and conventional truth.Since empty and dependently arisen phenomena are onto logically united, the knowledge of empty phenomena is epistomologically interlinked with that of dependently arisen phenomena—the latter is, in fact, founded on the former. To the extent that empty phenomena are understood in terms of relational and dependently arisen phenomena, empty phenomena are always functional and causally effective. The phrase “empty phenomena,” although expressed negatively, is not negative in a metaphysical sense— it is not equivalent to no-thingness. Although the empty phenomenon appears to its cognizing consciousness negatively and without any positive affirma­tion, it is nonetheless equivalent to a relational and dependently arisen phe­nomenon seen in a different light. Since seeing phenomena as empty does not violate the inevitable epistemic link with the understanding of phe­nomena as dependently arisen, and the converse also applies, so the unity between the two truths—understanding things both as empty and as dependently arisen—is made clear.Tsongkhapa also argues, moreover, that the realization of phenomena as dependently arisen is a necessary condition for the realization of both truths; one cant realize phenomena as empty unless one sees them as dependently arisen. “So long as the understanding pertaining to empirically consistent appearances—dependently arisen—and the understanding pertaining to"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthe empty [phenomena]—free from all claims—are seen as mutually exclu­sive,” Tsongkhapa avers, “the purport of the Buddha is not yet under­stood.”125 Thus for Tsongkhapa the philosophical inquiry is not complete until one achieves simultaneous realizations of the two truths.However, the process of philosophical analysis is complete when­ever these [two realizations] operate simultaneously, not in turn, and consequently all conceived objects [blindfolding] the dis­cerning wisdom are eschewed merely by seeing empirically con­sistent dependently arisen phenomena.126The unity between the two truths, according to Tsongkhapa, does not apply merely to ontological and epistemological issues; it applies equally to soteriology— the practical means to Buddhist liberation, the freedom from suffering. As Jamyang Shepai Dorje, one of the central commentators on Tsongkhapas works, notes:Undermining either of the two truths would result in a similar downfall— a similar eventual ruin. If, however, they are not undermined, they are alike insofar as the accomplishment of the two accumulations and the attainment of the two kayas,127 and so forth, are concerned. If one undermined conventional [truth] by denying it, one would succumb to the extreme of nihilism, which robs the root of virtue, and consequently migrate to the realm of unfortunates. It would also undermine the fruit and the means by which rupakaya is accomplished. It is therefore not sensible to approach the two truths with bias...Since this rela­tion continues [as a means to avoid] falling into extremes and being ruined thereby, and also to accomplish the two accumula­tions and attain the two kayas, it is imperative that the two truths be understood as mutually interrelated.128The ultimate soteriological goal for Tsongkhapa is to attain perfect enlightenment, and this attainment, as the above passages explain, depends on the accomplishment of a buddhas rupakaya (form body) and dhar- makaya (truth body). The accomplishment of the two kayas in turn depends on properly comprehending the unity of the two truths. The rupakaya is accomplished as a result of the exhaustive accumulation of virtues, while the dharmakaya results from the exhaustive accumulation of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS33penetrative wisdom. The former emphasizes an engagement with the wis­dom of dependent arising, while the latter emphasizes an engagement with the wisdom of emptiness.Accomplishing the virtues requires a practical orientation and a conven­tional engagement with the world, activities such as practicing the first five of the so-called six perfections—generosity, morality, forbearance, effort, and meditative stability. All these engagements are undertaken in conform­ity with worldly conventions and the wisdom of dependent arising. The accumulation of penetrative wisdom, the sixth perfection, emphasizes the direct experience of ultimate truth, including the direct experience of impermanent, selfless, and empty phenomena. This requires the transcen­dence of worldly conventions on the basis of meditative equipoise. The accomplishment of both accumulations, however, culminates in the purifi­cation of defilements and the simultaneous realization of both emptiness and dependent arising, the two truths.Bearing in mind the soteriological unity of the two truths, and therefore of empty and dependently arisen phenomena, Nagarjuna thus remarks: “By virtue of this meritorious deed, may all people accumulate merit and wis­dom, and attain the two noble fruits [i.e., rupakaya and dharmakaya] that arise from merit and wisdom.”129 The Buddha himself implies how the two truths are soteriologically intertwined in this invocation of the well-known four noble truths: “Bhikkhus, he who sees suffering sees also the origin of suffering, sees also the cessation of suffering, sees also the way leading to the cessation of suffering.”130 As Kapstein notes, “...the two truths scheme is no longer essentially a hermeneutical device used to interpret the four noble truths discourse, nor is it merely an alternative classificatory scheme; rather, the two truths embrace and include the four noble truths themselves.”131 Since the four noble truths are divisions within the two truths,132 and since the four noble truths are soteriologically intertwined, the Buddha clearly points out that the two truths are united even in soteriological terms. In Gyaltsab Je’s words:Since the two kayas— the jnanadharmakaya and sambhogakdya —depend on the appropriation of the same actual conditions, they are related. They are also consummated simultaneously... Therefore logically it follows that the phenomenal basis consists of a unity between the two truths, the soteriology consists of a unity between the two accumulations, and the result consists of a unity between dharmakaya and rupakaya.133"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEKalupahana puts it similarly: “Artha as well as paramartha are truths (satya). The former [conventional truth] is not presented as an un-truth (a-satya) in relation to the latter [ultimate truth], as it would be in an abso- lutistic tradition. Neither is the former sublated by the latter.” And fur­ther: “There is no indication whatsoever that these are two truths with different standing as higher and lower.”134 Neither truth is higher nor lower than the other, neither more true nor less true, and neither more significant nor less significant.135 Therefore Candraklrti states: “The doc­trines taught by the Buddha are based on the two truths.”136 He stresses this point by saying, “Were there any other truth whatsoever [apart from the four noble truths], that too would certainly be contained within the categories of the two truths.”137 Tsongkhapa agrees.Why Is Conventional Truth False and Deceptive?If the two natures are ontologically identical, why is conventional truth described as deceptive and false, while ultimate truth is described as non­deceptive and true? “Nondeceptive,” Tsongkhapa argues, “is the mode of truth (bden tshul) of the ultimate. That is, ultimate truth does not deceive the world by posing one mode of appearance while existing in another mode.”138 Ultimate truth is described as “ultimate,” not because it is absolute or higher than conventional truth, but simply because of its con­sistent character—its mode of appearance and its mode of being are the same— in contrast with the inconsistent character of conventional truth. Ultimate truth is nondeceptive for the same reason. Thus Candraklrti writes, in his commentary on the Yuktisastikd: “[Interlocutor]: Why is nirvana said to be the ultimate truth? [Reply]: Nirvana is said to be ultimate truth based purely on worldly conventions—its nature does not deceive the world.”139To the cognizing consciousness, conventional truth presents itself as inherently existent. It appears to have substance, or essence, and therefore it deceives ordinary beings. “Insofar as conventional phenomena present themselves as more than conventional— as inherently existent—they deceive us. We take them to be what they are not—to be intrinsically identified, inherently existent entities. In that sense, they are false,” writes Garfield. “But to the extent that we understand them as dependently arisen, empty, interdependent phenomena, they constitute a conventional truth.”140 Nagarjuna also recognizes the deceptive nature of conventional truth in this sense: “The Victorious Conqueror has said that whatever is"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS35deceptive is false. Compounded phenomena are deceptive. Therefore they are all false.”141So far as Tsongkhapa is concerned, the rationale behind describing one of the two truths as ultimate, nondeceptive, or true, and the other as con­ventional, false, or deceptive, is to contrast the two truths on the basis of the consistency between their modes of appearance and existence. Since ultimate truth is, by definition, consistent with its mode of appearance, it is not deceptive, even to ordinary beings. However, since conventional truth is, by definition, inconsistent with its mode of appearance, it deceives ordinary beings. It is thus crucial to understand exactly what sense of false­hood is in play when the conventional is characterized as “deceptive,” as Garfield rightly points out.142Nevertheless this does not mean that ultimate truth can be considered epistemologically more significant than conventional truth. It is true that ordinary beings are deceived by the false and deceptive appearances of con­ventional truth, but the question is, are they deceived because of their knowledge of conventional truth or because they have no proper knowl­edge of conventional truth? The fact that conventional truth deceives ordi­nary beings, according to Tsongkhapa, demonstrates that they have not yet understood what conventional truth is.Although ordinary beings experience false and deceptive conventional truth all the time, they remain oblivious to the inconsistent, and in this sense false and deceptive, nature of conventional truth. Thus instead of knowing such truths for what they are, ordinary beings perceive them to be essentially real—as if conventional truth were ultimate truth. Garfield explains:Yet one must bear in mind that, according to Nagarjuna [and also for Tsongkhapa], perception untutored by Madhyamika philosophy and rigorous practice delivers objects to conscious­ness as inherently existent. In this sense, the things that we see are wholly false. For most of us, the best that we can do is reason our way into knowing, but not seeing, their true nature. The goal of meditation on emptiness is to bring this knowledge into per­ceptual experience and, hence, to see things as they are.143Tsongkhapa maintains an important distinction between knowledge of conventional truth and the ordinary experience of conventional truth. For him, they are not equivalent. Tsongkhapa contends that the ordinary being"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"3<$THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEdirectly experiences conventional truth yet has no direct understanding of it. For ordinary beings, seeing physical forms, tasting flavors, smelling aro­mas, hearing sounds, touching tangible objects, and conceiving ideas are in themselves sufficient for leading a worldly life. Knowledge of conven­tional truth is not required. One may participate in mundane norms with mere perceptual or conceptual experiences of conventional truth—even reified ones.Tsongkhapa likens the experience of conventional truths by ordinary beings to an audience held spellbound by a magic show. While the audi­ence experiences the illusory animals conjured up by the magician, they may remain ignorant of the illusory nature of their experience. Knowledge of the reality is not necessary to experience the captivating effect. Similarly, so long as beings are ignorant of conventional truth, and thereby deceived by conventional truth, they are also ignorant of ultimate truth. Bodhi- dharma, the founder of Zen Buddhism, captures this point nicely: “Ques­tion: ‘What are the two truths?’ Answer: ‘It is like the simmering of heated air. Deluded people see the air waving due to the heat and understand it as water, but it is really not water. It is simmering of heated air.” And he con­tinues: “The meaning of the two truths is also like this. Common men see the truth of the highest meaning as the worldly truth. Sages see the worldly truth as the truth of the highest meaning. Therefore, the sutra says: ‘When the Buddhas speak Dharma, they always rely upon the two truths.’ The truth of the highest meaning is the worldly truth, and the worldly truth is the truth of the highest meaning.”144So, as long as we lack proper knowledge and understanding of either con­ventional or ultimate truth, Tsongkhapa insists, we have knowledge of nei­ther. When we have proper knowledge of either of the two truths, we have proper knowledge of both.Applying the Worldly ConventionIs it possible to reconcile Tsongkhapas proposal that there are two actual truths with the Buddhas declaration that nirvana is the only truth? In the Culaviyuha Suttay the Buddha states: “The truth is one, there is no second about which a person who knows it would argue with one who knows. Con- templatives promote their various personal truths, that is why they do not say one thing and the same.”145 In the Yuktisastikavrtti [35], Candrakirti raises the same question: “When the jlnas have stated that nirvana alone is true, what learned person will then imagine that the rest is not false? How"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS37would you interpret that nirvana alone is true and others are untrue?”146 For the answer to this question Tsongkhapa relies on Candraklrti s own expla­nation in the Yuktisastikavrtti:[Interlocutor]: Well, the Bhagavan states: “Oh monks! There is one noble truth. That is nirvana, which is characteristically non- deceptive. What do you make of this statement?” [Reply]: Nir­vana is not like conditioned phenomena, which deceive the childish by presenting false appearances. For the existence of nirvana is always consistent with its characteristic of the nonar­ising nature. Unlike conditioned phenomena, it never appears, even to the childish, as having a nature of arising (skye bdi ngo bo). Since nirvana is always consistent with the mode of existence of nirvana, it is explained as the noble truth, yet strictly in terms of worldly conventions.147For Tsongkhapa the crucial point here is that Candraklrti emphasizes that nirvana is said to be the truth strictly in terms of worldly conventions. Let us briefly examine what Candraklrti meant by this and why it is crucial for Tsongkhapas position.According to Candraklrti and Tsongkhapa, in ordinary worldly discourse one may pose the question of whether phenomena such as a visual illusion, a mirage, a reflection of a face in a mirror, an echo of sound, and an image of the moon in a pool are true?To say that they are not true would not help to resolve the issue, since it would merely lead to the further question, why do they exist at all? The unicorn and the rabbit s horn are also false, yet they are nowhere to be found in the way that we find mirages, mirror images, and so forth. The real answer within the ordinary worldly convention (and therefore not from the Madhyamaka standpoint) must be something like this: “Entities such as illusions, mirages, reflections, and so forth are real, but they do not exist the way they appear to us. They all appear to be some­thing other than they really are.” It is the inconsistency between the appear­ance and the mode of existence that marks these entities as false, and since even the ordinary worldly consciousness understands this inconsistency, so visual illusions, mirages, mirror images, and so forth are described as false and deceptive phenomena. Thus, for Tsongkhapa, these are descriptions in conventional terms.On the other hand, what constitutes the truth of an actual version of a face, moon, sound, and water, as opposed to an illusion or reflection?"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATECommon sense suggests the answer would be that “because their appear­ances and modes of existence are consistent, they are true and nondecep- tive.” The nondeceptive nature of a face, moon, or sound is its ultimate truth from the perspective of worldly convention. Hence they are conven­tionally perceived as true or real instead of as false.Both Candraklrti and Tsongkhapa recognize this linguistic convention and mobilize exactly the same dialectical styles (as seen in Candraklrtis quote above) in the Prasangika Madhyamaka system. Thus the Prasangika Madhyamikas’ insistence on conformity with the worldly conventions, at least according to Tsongkhapas reading of it, has highly significant philo­sophical implications. Here are his arguments.First, just as an illusion, a mirror image, etc., are real in an ordinary sense, despite the fact that they are deceptive and false, so, too, conventional phe­nomena in the Prasangika Madhyamaka sense are real, and can even be said to constitute truths, despite being recognized by the Madhyamikas them­selves as false and deceptive. Second, because the concept of ultimate truth is also taken from its ordinary application, nirvana is spoken of as “ultimate” on the ground of its nondeceptive nature, in the sense that its mode of exis­tence is consistent with its mode of appearance. The nondeceptive nature of the empty phenomenon itself constitutes its truth, and so it is conven­tionally described as ultimate in the Prasangika system.Furthermore these worldly conventions, according to Tsongkhapa and Candraklrti, further illustrate that there is no room for hierarchical ranking of the truths. Take the reflection of a face in the mirror, for instance, as opposed to the actual face. We might naively assume that because the reflec­tion of a face is not an actual face and does not function as the actual face, it is of lesser importance or significance. But such logic would lead to the con­verse assumption that the actual face must also be of lesser importance or significance because it is not the reflection of the face, and therefore it does not function as the reflection of the face. The mere fact that the image is not something other than what it is (it is not what it reflects) should not dimin­ish its significance. Understood as a reflection, the mirror image of the face has its own significance and even its own causal effectiveness, just as does the actual face. Moreover for Tsongkhapa the causal effectiveness of a thing is pre­cisely what determines its being true. As a result of this determining factor, the thing is empirically functional, even if not necessarily consistent with its appearance, and therefore true in the ordinary sense, in its own right.Now let us apply the same concept in the classic Prasangika context. If we claim that the conventional characteristics of a sprout, such as its color,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS39shape, extension, size, and weight, are of lesser importance or significance because these characteristics are not identical with its emptiness, the reverse logic also applies. For the sprouts empty mode of being would not be able to function as the sprouts conventional truth, nor would it manifest itself as the sprout’s conventional characteristics. Thus Tsongkhapa asserts that neither of the two truths is more or less significant than the other. Indeed, while the illusion only makes sense as illusion in relation to that which is not illusion, the reflection only makes sense as reflection in relation to that which is reflected. So, too, does the real only make sense as real in relation to the illusion, the thing reflected in relation to its reflection. This also holds in the case of discussions about the ultimate nature of things, such as the being of the sprout— it only makes sense inasmuch as it holds in dis­cussions of ordinary phenomena. The only criterion that determines a thing’s truth in the Prasangika Madhyamaka system, as represented by Tsongkhapa, is the causal effectiveness of the thing as opposed to mere heuristic significance. The sprout’s empty mode of being and its being as appearance are both truths, insofar as both are causally effective, and thus both functional.The two truths, understood as, respectively, the empty and the depend­ently arisen characters of phenomena, are on equal footing according to Prasangika Madhyamikas of Tsongkhapas persuasion. Nevertheless these truths have different designations— the sprouts empty mode is always described as “ultimate truth,” while the conventional properties, such as color and shape, are described as “conventional truths.” The former is accepted as nondeceptive truth while the sprout’s conventional properties are accepted as deceptive ox false truth, despite common sense dictating that they are true and real.From the standpoint of an arya’s meditative equipoise, even what is accepted as empirically real in the ordinary sense is understood as false and deceptive truth. The sprouts conventional properties, for example, while having one mode of existence, present themselves to their cognizing con­sciousnesses with the conflicting modes of appearance. The sprout’s empty mode, on the other hand, is accepted as nondeceptive truth from the stand­point of an arya’s meditative equipoise, for the way it exists and the way it appears to this consciousness are consistent.Nevertheless, Tsongkhapa does not regard the worldly convention of ascribing different nomenclatures such as true or false, deceptive or nonde­ceptive, as bestowing truth on one and not the other. In Garfield’s words: “It is important to note that they are introduced as two truths, and that they"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"4 0THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEare introduced as distinct. This will be important to bear in mind...For it is tempting, since one of the truths is characterized as an ultimate truth, to think of the conventional as ‘less true/”148 Just as ultimate truth is a form of truth, so, too is conventional truth—hence, for Tsongkhapa, there are indeed two truths.Nevertheless, since the two truths are not conceptually or epistemologi- cally identical in all respects, Tsongkhapa maintains they are rightly desig­nated as “conventional truth” and “ultimate truth,” rather than just as “truth.”The One and Only TruthLet us now turn to Gorampa. In his view the two truths are binary oppo­sites. Moreover, for Gorampa, whatever is false and deceptive cannot be truth—nondeception is thus the mark of truth. With this in mind, he argues: “Truth, in the end, cannot be divided into two. It therefore makes no sense to enumerate it. Therefore in the sutra, it is said that ‘there is only one noble truth, i.e., nirvana, which is by nature nondeceptive/”149 Gorampa also cites Nagarjunas statement: “When the jlnas have stated that nirvana alone is true, what learned person will then imagine that the rest is not false?”150Gorampa rejects the authority of conventional truth by treating it as a projection of conventional mind—it is the ignorance of ordinary beings. As he writes:[Question]: If this were true, even the mere term conventional truth would be unacceptable, for whatever is conventional is incompatible with truth. [Reply]: Since [conventional] truth is posited only in relation to a conventional mind, there is no prob­lem. Even so-called true conventionalities (yang dag kun rdzob ces pa yang) are posited as truth with respect to a conventional mind.151This statement is based on the assumption that conventional truth is not actual truth. To justify the description of conventional phenomena as a form of truth, Gorampa argues that conventional truth is simply described to suit the “conventional mind,” that is, the ignorant mind of an ordinary being experiencing the phenomenal world. In other words, conventional truth is described as “truth” only from the perspective of ignorance. It is a truth projected (sgro brtagpa) and taken for granted."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS41Gorampa equates the ontological significance of conventional truth with “the appearances of nonexistent entities like illusions.”152 As Sakya Pandita puts it: “Conventional truths are like reflections of the moon in the water— despite their nonexistence, they appear due to thoughts.”153 And Sakya Pandita further argues: “The defining characteristic of conventional truth constitutes the appearances of the nonexistent objects.”154 In this sense, conventional truths “are things apprehended by the cognition perceiving empirical entities [i.e., the ignorance of ordinary beings]. Those very things are found as nonexistent by the cognition analyzing their mode of existence that is itself posited as the ultimate.”155Most importantly, Gorampa argues that to describe conventional truth as “truth” has great pedagogical significance. Conventional truth is an expe­dient means to achieve ultimate truth, says Gorampa, and the Buddha described conventional truth as truth to suit the mentality of ordinary beings.156 The two truths are thus categorized as a means (thabs) and a result (thabs byung). Conventional truth, for Gorampa, is the means to attain the one and only truth that is nirvana.157 When conventional truth is provision­ally designated as truth, it is contrasted with ultimate truth by treating the former as ignorant (rmongs), or ignorance, and the latter as non-ignorant (ma rmongs), or wisdom.158According to Gorampas view, any duality ascribed to truth is untenable. Since there is only one truth, it cannot be distinguished any further. Sakya Pandita,159 Longchen Rabjam,160 Rendawa,161 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,162 Taktsang Lotsawa,163 Shakya Chogden,164 and Gendun Chopel165 all agree with Gorampa that truth itself is not divisible. These scholars also agree that the distinction between the two truths is essentially between two conflict­ing perspectives, rather than any division within truth as such. As such Shakya Chogden, for example, writes:Precise enumeration (grangs nges) of the twofold truth explained by all earlier Tibetans rests on the precise enumeration of the mistaken cognition (bio ’khrul) and unmistaken cognition (bio ma khrul). With this underpinning reason, they explained the precise enumeration through the elimination of the third alter­native. There is not even a single figure to be found who claims the view comparable with the latter [Tibetan scholars, i.e., the Gelugpas], who assert a precise enumeration of the twofold truth based on the certification of valid cognitions.166"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEAmong those who avowedly join Gorampa in claiming that the ultimate truth (i.e., nirvana) is the sole truth and that the phenomenal world is utter illusion are Longchen Rabjam,167 Shakya Chogden,168Taktsang Lotsawa,169 Mipham Rinpoche,170 Karmapa Mikyo Dorje,171 and Gendiin Chopel.172 Modern scholars such as Lindtner,173 Singh,174 Stcherbatsky,175 and Murti176 also follow the same line of argument. Although all of them are monists about truth, there is a differentiation to be made. Shakya Chogden177 and Taktsang Lotsawa are nonabsolute monists. Although they maintain that ultimate truth is the sole truth, they do not claim it as a truly established phe­nomenon (bden par grub pa), one that withstands logical analysis. For exam­ple, Taktsang Lotsawa argues, “nirvana, alone, is accepted as the truth and nondeceptive from the perspective of reasoning consciousness. Even then, when it is subjected to analysis, not only is nirvana unestablished, but if anything at all superseded nirvana, that should also remain [unestab­lished].”178 Thus no phenomenon, according to Taktsang Lotsawa, with­stands logical analysis. The rest are avowed absolute monists. For example, Mipham Rinpoche proposes with clarity and vigor that the ultimate truth is ultimately established and that it withstands logical analysis without being undermined:Reality is truly established. Conventional phenomena are estab­lished as false and deceptive. The ultimate, which is free from [falsity and deception], is established as truth of nondeception and nonfalsehood. If this remains unestablished, it would then be impossible to see the arya’s truth. Merely seeing false and deceptive objects like ordinary beings would never ever free any­body. .. Whatever is dharmata, i.e., ultimate truth, is truly estab­lished, because it is established as the cognitive sphere of nondual wisdom. Besides, it withstands logical analysis, for no logical rea­soning whatsoever can undermine it or destroy it. Therefore so long as it does not withstand logical analysis, it is not ultimate, because it would absurdly be conventional.179Modern interpreters—such as Kalupahana,180 Jay Garfield,181 Jeffrey Hopkins,182 Paul Williams,183 Guy Newland,184Tom Tillemans,183 and Jos^ Cabezon186—have in some of their works suggested a distinction between the two truths that is minimal and strictly epistemological in nature. Con­ventional truth and ultimate truth are, in their presentation of Madhya- maka philosophy, mutually entailing— the two truths are not ontologically"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TRUTHS43hierarchical. Others modem interpretions treat conventional and ultimate as levels of truth or reality.187 This view of the two truths, Newland argues, is no different from “an understanding of the two truths as alternative standpoints or perspectives.”188 In other contemporary works, scholars present a range ofviews.189 It is apparent that there is neither consensus nor complete dissension on the issue of the relationship between the two truths.This is not the case, however, with the views held by Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. Since Tsongkhapa views both truths as actual truths, he is fully committed to a nonparadoxical, mutually entailing, and nonhierarchical relationship between them. In contrast, since for Gorampa ultimate truth is the only truth, he is committed to a paradoxical, contradictory, and hier­archical relationship between the two truths.ConclusionThe gulf between Tsongkhapas and Gorampas positions regarding the nature of the relationship between the two truths is evident from the out­set and lays the groundwork for the debate between them. The key to Tsongkhapas view is his insistence on the two-natures theory while for Gorampa it is the mere-mind theory. Tsongkhapa attempts to show that both truths have the two natures as their ontological reference, and so the distinction between them cannot be reduced to one of mere perspective or a purely epistemological or linguistic practice. In contrast, Gorampas approach reinforces the conception of the two truths as founded in two contradictory perspectives. Consequently, for him, the distinction between the two truths is purely subjective and ultimately reducible to their cogniz­ing consciousnesses—ignorance and wisdom.When the analysis moves to the relationship between the two truths, the gap widens. By arguing that the two truths have a single ontological iden­tity, even though they have different conceptual identities, Tsongkhapa shows that they have equal ontological status despite being verified along separate epistemic pathways. He also insists that they are equally significant in terms of their epistemological and soteriological values. Gorampa insists that the two truths are distinct and incompatible; he not only argues that they are ontologically distinct, but he also disparages conventional truth as less significant in terms of its epistemological and soteriological value. By casting the two truths hierarchically, Gorampa upholds a monistic and abso­lutist view.

Meanings and Definitions of the Two TruthsWhen asked “Great sage, what is the meaning of the truth?”Manjus'ri answered: “Son of heaven, the truth is no other than voidness.Thus voidness may be called the truth. Voidness is said to be the truth because it is without beginning and end, without decrease and increase.That [dharmas are] empty of nature is the truth. Suchness is the truth.The dharmadhatu is the truth. Reality is the truth. Thus such a truth is no truth [at all].”190IntroductionTh is c h a p t e r compares Tsongkhapas and Gorampas definitions of the two truths in two parts. The first part offers a detailed analysis of the meaning of the two truths.191 This includes analyses of sev­eral important concepts related to the meaning of conventional, or samvrti (kun rdzob)—namely, ignorance, mutual interdependence, and worldly conventions. These concepts and relations, as we will see, are critical in understanding the defining characteristics of the two truths. They are also key to clarifying the background to the discussion and addressing the significance of, and relationship between, the two truths.Since the meanings and definitions of samvrti proposed by Tsongkhapa and Gorampa are closely intertwined with their understanding of the scope and limits of the objects of negation, we will explore the nature of ignorance in relation to the concealers (sgribpa, avaranas). This will be followed by a brief, but nonetheless important, comparison of the various meanings of ultimate truth, or paramdrthasatya (don dam bden pa); here the focus will be on whether the unconditioned and transcendent nature of paramartha­satya is epistemological or metaphysical.4 5"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"4 6THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEThe second part of this chapter is devoted to a comparative study of the definitions of the two truths offered by Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. Firstly,I will compare the criteria they each mobilize to determine the defining characteristics of the two truths. I will argue that for Gorampa, the two con­tradictory perspectives, namely, ignorance and wisdom, determine his defi­nitions of the two truths, whereas for Tsongkhapa, this is determined by the empirically valid consciousness and ultimately valid consciousness. Sec­ondly, through a comparison of the status of the two truths, Tsongkhapas view that the two truths stand on an equal footing is reinforced. In his understanding all empirically given phenomena satisfy the defining charac­teristics of both truths, since they are equivalent to the dual natures verified by their corresponding consciousnesses. I will argue that for Gorampa, in contrast, the defining characteristics of the two truths are mutually exclud­ing and hierarchical.The Meanings of SamvrtiWe begin with Candraklrti s explanation of the meaning of samvrti. In the Prasannapadd he attributes three meanings to the term:Samvrti means entirely obstructing. That is, ignorance is the con­cealer (samvrti, kun rdzob) because it entirely covers up the such­ness of all things. Or, samvrti means interdependence; it has the sense of “due to being interdependent.” Or, samvrti means “term”; it is equivalent with “worldly convention.” [In this sense,] it has the character of expression and expressed, con­sciousness and object of consciousness, etc.192Tsongkhapa and Gorampa both comment on Candrakirti’s three senses (sgra bshad) of samvrti:193• ignorant consciousness, which conceals the true nature of things either through the conception of essence or through the reification of essence;• that which is mutually interdependent (phan tshun brtan pa, para- parasam bhavana);• worldly conventions (jig rten tha snyad, lokavyavahdra).Tsongkhapa comments on these three meanings as follows:"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS47[i] Kun rdzob (samvrti) is nescience or ignorance because it con­ceals Cgebs), and thereby obstructs (sgrib par byed pa) reality.Since the [Sanskrit] equivalent of kun rdzob (samvrti) also applies to the obstruction (sgrib pa)> it is explained in these terms; this however is far from stating that all kun rdzob are obstructors. [2]Or, kun rdzob means mutually interdependent (phan tshun brtan pa). This means that, since [all phenomena] must be mutually interdependent, it is untrue that they possess self-instituting natures (tshugs thub kyi rang bzhinpa). The reason for this expla­nation of the term [kun rdzob] is also applicable to ultimate truth, yet the term kun rdzob does not apply [to ultimate truth, for it is not kun rdzo!f\\. For example, the reason for the explana­tion of the term “lake-born’ [lotus flowers] is applicable to frogs [since frogs are born in lakes], but the term “lake-born” does not apply to them [because they are not lotuses]. [3] Or, kun rdzob means terms (brday samket)—i.e., worldly conventions (jigrten gyi tha snyady lokavyavahara). That too is explained as having characteristics of expresser and expressed, consciousness and object of consciousness, and so forth. Therefore [kun rdzob] must not held to be merely the object possessing conventions (yul can gyi tha snyad)y consciousness, and expressions.194Gorampas explanation states:[1] Kun rdzob is that which obstructs all. The primal ignorance is described as kun rdzob because ignorance thoroughly conceals the reality of things. [2] Or, kun rdzob means mutually interde­pendent. It means [that things] are mutually interdependent. [3]Or, kun rdzob refers to terms, i.e., worldly conventions. That too is explained as having the characteristics of expresser and expressed, consciousness and objects of consciousness, and so forth.195Both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa point out that these are connotations or implications samvrti (kun rdzob) may bear in various contexts. In the fol­lowing three sections, we will briefly consider the epistemological, ontolog­ical, and soteriological significance of each of these three meanings in turn."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATESamvrti as Ignorant ConsciousnessIn the first sense of samvrti, the debate between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa centers primarily on the scope of ignorance and its implications for the sys­tem of conventional truths (samvrtisatyay kun rdzob bden pa). Tsongkhapa argues that essences reified by ignorant consciousness are strictly epistemo­logical, since they are purely conceptual reifications. Empirically, essences are nonexistent and, strictly speaking, do not have any ontological founda­tion. Despite the reifying agents themselves (ordinary beings) clinging to essences as realities or truths, those essences do not constitute empirical truths. The eradication of ignorance thus leads to the eradication of con­ceptually reified essences, but not to that of empirical truths themselves.Gorampa argues that empirical truths are themselves essences reified by ignorance, and he therefore also denies that there are any so-called concep­tually reified essences apart from what are empirically given. The eradica­tion of ignorance, according to this view, leads to the eradication of empirical truth.In the context in which samvrti refers to ignorant consciousness, both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa maintain that samvrti has the connotation of what Newland196 calls a “concealer,” for it specifically refers to a conscious­ness that conceals the true identities of phenomena. Phenomena, for both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa, are devoid of essences and are essentially empty of any substantial mode of being. Due to ignorance, however, as Tsong­khapa and Gorampa explain it, ordinary beings conceptually reify or super­impose (sgro dogs pa) onto phenomena the notion of an essential mode of existence. Tsongkhapa and Gorampa also agree that ignorance compels ordinary beings to unconsciously apply conceptually distorted identities to phenomena, and to confuse them with true identities. Since ignorance con­ceals the truth from being directly perceived, it is described as a “con­cealer.”197 Ignorance is also described as an “obscuring consciousness” (rmongs par byed) inasmuch as it literally obstructs sentient beings from see­ing things as they really are. Gorampa, for example, argues:In the first [etymological explanation of] samvrtisatya, sam is [an abbreviated form] of samyagy meaning “reality,” and vrti means “to conceal.” Since it conceals the true meaning of reality, igno­rance— the conception of true existence—is a model of kun rdzob, regardless of the difference between reified objects (kun brtagpa) and intuitive assumptions (lhan skyes). Satya (bden pa)"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS49means “truth.” It is truth in the sense that it appears true from the perspective of the ignorant consciousness.198However, Tsongkhapa and Gorampa soon diverge in their treatments of ignorance. Unlike Tsongkhapa, Gorampa goes on to argue that samvrti in its connotation as ignorance is responsible for reifying samvrtisatya, that is, for reifying the whole system of empirical truths (tha snyad bden pa, vyavaharikasatya). Indeed, according to Gorampas view, there is no cogni­tive process that does not reify samvrtisatya at the same time as verifying it. Every cognitive event, either perceptual or conceptual, reifies or conceives essence, and therefore reifies or conceives all cognitions and cognized objects classified as objects of negation (dgag by a). Every cognition thus operates under the influence of ignorance.Objects of negation, according to Gorampa, are of two types—soterio­logical objects of negation (lamgyi dgag bya) and epistemological objects of negation (rigpa’i dgag bya). We will leave the details of soteriological objects of negation for later consideration and first address the exact scope of epis­temological objects of negation in Gorampas account. In the following pas­sage Gorampa clearly asserts that all subjects and objects, and thus all conventional truths, belong to epistemological objects of negation:The soteriological object of negation is constitutive of all decep­tive appearances. The epistemological (rigspa) and the scriptural (lung) objects of negation (dgag bya)...2xt comprised of appre­hended objects and apprehending subjects. The former [appre­hended objects] include two types [of objects of negation]: that which is grossly reified through philosophical misconception and that which is reified by virtue of innate misconception.. .The latter, the subjective object of negation, is comprised of all cog­nitions and distorted views— including concepts such as “this object,” and “that object.”199Tsongkhapa also distinguishes between soteriological and epistemologi­cal objects of negation. However, for him epistemological objects of nega­tion consist of “the conception of essence” and of “essence perse.”200 Of the two, he sees the latter as fundamental, since the eradication of reified essence leads to the eradication of the consciousness that conceives or reifies essence. The erroneous conception of essence does not arise if its concep­tual object, i.e., essence, is negated. The cognizing subject depends on its"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"50THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEobject to exist, since the existence of both subject and object is one of mutual interdependence.201 In direct contrast with Gorampas view, wherein empirical truths themselves are considered as epistemological objects of negation, Tsongkhapa argues that “whatever is [the epistemolog­ical] object of negation must have no empirical existence. For something that exists empirically cannot be repudiated by way of conceptual analy­sis.”202 This does not mean that repudiation of epistemological objects of negation is a futile exercise. Despite the nonexistence of essence per sey argues Tsongkhapa, “the misconceptions pertaining to the existence of essence still arise. This has to be repudiated.”203Given the more restricted scope of the first sense of samvrti, Tsongkhapa equates it with ignorance and maintains that whatever is reified by igno­rance must be included among epistemological objects of negation. It is thus crucial to note that, in this context, the term samvrti should not be understood in its usual sense. The scope of samvrti does not, therefore, include subjects and objects in any broad sense. Gorampa, again, argues that the first sense of samvrti must include all conventional phenomena. He derives this argument from his Indian predecessor, Jayananda (ca. 1200 c.e.). Jayananda treats the entire system of samvrtisatya as a reification of ignorance. In his commentary on the Madhayamakavatara, Jayananda dis­tinguishes between the two types of concealers (sgribpa, dvaranas)—namely, deluded ignorance (nyon mongs can gyi ma rig pa, klesajnana) and nonde­luded ignorance (nyon mongs can ma yin pai ma rig pa, aklesajnana). The former is seen as responsible for causing the recurrence of samsaric life, while the latter is held responsible for the appearance of the conventional world.204 Gorampa is in complete accord with Jayananda on this issue.Tsongkhapa considers the view held by Jayananda, and therefore Gorampa, to be extremely problematic, at least as far as the Prasangika Madhyamaka is concerned. For Tsongkhapa, to identify ignorance as samvrti “amounts to identifying samvrti in terms of a perspective that refers to samvrti, but this does not amount to identifying samvrti in a general sense.”205 To describe samvrti or ignorance as a concealer because it obstructs seeing true reality is “far from claiming that all samvrti are con­cealers” according to Tsongkhapa.206 It is acceptable for the Prasangika Madhyamaka to maintain that all phenomena are samvrti, that is, conven­tionalities, and yet it is not acceptable to maintain that all phenomena are samvrti, that is, concealers of reality. Hence “concealer of reality,” in the case of Tsongkhapa, specifically refers to ignorant consciousness but not to phe­nomenal objects and sense perceptions."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS51Tsongkhapa does acknowledge, however, that samvrti has another dimension. When samvrti—ignorance as a concealer of reality—is under­stood in conjunction with the term satya (bdenpa)y then the two terms can be combined to form samvrtisatya (kun rdzob bden pa)—literally, “truth for a concealer.” In this context, satya should be taken as the object of con­sciousness, while samvrti refers to the deluded consciousness itself. This very specific samvrtisatya, according to Tsongkhapa, “is posited entirely by the power of a deluded ignorance.”207 In fact, this particular satya, as we are about to see, is said to be entirely fabricated by the deluded consciousness— it has no empirical objectivity whatsoever.The question then arises: What is the ontological status of satya., i.e., truth reified by this samvrti (deluded ignorance)? How is this particular truth as reified by ignorance different from other empirically given truths? Since Gorampa treats conceptually reified truth and empirically given truth as one and the same, these questions do not arise for him. But as Tsong­khapa insists on the radical distinction of conceptually reified truth from empirically given truth, his responses to the above questions are crucial:Under the influence of this kun rdzob—the conception of true existence—things such as blue colors appear to have essential existence, while in fact they have no essence whatsoever. False constructions fabricated [by the ignorance] appear so real to sen­tient beings that they are described by the Buddha as “truths for worldly beings,” i.e., they are real [only] from the perspective of the erroneous consciousness of ordinary beings.208In Tsongkhapas view, satya—truth reified by ignorance—entails reified essence and the conception of essence. Essence fabricated by ignorance, which is truth or reality for deluded consciousness, is nevertheless utterly rejected by Madhyamaka thought. In fact, Tsongkhapa argues that it is one of the distinctive features of Prasangika (as opposed to Svatantrika) to pro­claim that things do not have essences even conventionally. Although essence is recognized as truth by ordinary people— and thus described as a truth for ordinary beings, or “truth for a concealer”—it is nonetheless utterly nonexistent for the Prasangikas.For Prasangikas “essence... is not a conventional truth.”209 Far from being empirical truth, Tsongkhapa insists that “anything that is posited by the reifying cognition is not even conventionally possible.”210 For while essence is reified by ignorance, it is empirically nonexistent. Essence superimposed"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEor conceived through ignorance must not therefore have any empirical grounding (tha snyad du yang mi srid). For something to be qualified as samvrtisatya, Tsongkhapa argues that “it must inevitably satisfy an empiri­cal position.”211 Prasangika Madhyamikas are unanimous in asserting the impossibility of things existing essentially, in and of themselves. This is because no nonreifying consciousness, such as perception, verifies the exis­tence of essence. “This shows,” Tsongkhapa concludes, “that essence is purely subjective.”212 Kalupahana also notes that, for the Madhyamika, “the notion of a substance was rejected because it could not be identified with anything in experience.”213 For Tsongkhapa, then, reified essence and the conception of essence constitute the central epistemological objects of negation. This is why the distinction between the descriptions of phenom­ena as samvrti on the one hand and ignorance (understood as a reifying per­spective) as samvrti on the other plays such a crucial role in Tsongkhapas account.This gives rise to the next question: what is the impact of eradicating ignorance and its reified essence, and so of eradicating epistemological objects of negation? Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree that all phenomena conceived as essentially real by ordinary sentient beings are understood as conditioned and false by those who have eradicated ignorance. The essences fabricated by ignorance can only deceive immature beings, but these reified truths cannot deceive enlightened beings such as drya srdvakas, dryapratyekabuddhas, and drya bodhisattvas. Hence Tsongkhapa, for exam­ple, argues “since those beings no longer presuppose the existence of such essences, they see all phenomena as essentially unreal.”214 All conventional phenomena are “mere samvrti, just like illusions, and they are perceived as dependently arisen.”215 Gorampa agrees.In Tsongkhapas view, although the three types of aryas are free from samvrti—ignorance and its reified essence—their empirically valid cogni­tions consistently verify samvrtisatya, conventional truths.216 This means that although aryas understand all conditioned phenomena (samskara, du ybyed mams) as untrue, they do not reduce “conventional phenomena to nonconventional truths of some kind.”217 And those conventional truths are not concealers, whether they relate to subjective consciousness or to the object of that consciousness. But for Gorampa both subjective conscious­ness and objective phenomena, so long as they are samvrti, are responsible for concealing the truth. Both subjective consciousnesses and the objects of consciousnesses are, according to this view, concealers of reality. “Objective appearances of the conditioned phenomena perceived by the three types of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS53aryas in their postmeditative equipoise,” Gorampa argues, “are also conceal­ers of reality. For [those appearances] arise due to the power of the impres­sions or the apprehensions of duality.”218 Moreover Gorampa also claims that objective appearances obstruct the development of the meditative equipoise that transcends the apprehension of appearances.While Tsongkhapa argues that empirical truths are not posited by igno­rance but instead are certified by empirically valid consciousnesses, Gorampa takes empirical truths to be wholly posited by ignorance. Gorampa adopts this position from Jayananda. When Jayananda was asked, “But why are illusory objects like dependently arisen phenomena still apparent after the eradication of ignorance?” he replied, “The operation of mere ignorance conceals true knowledge (jneydvarana)”2l<) Gorampa shares this view.Samvrti as Mutually InterdependentThe second sense of samvrti is mutually interdependent (phan tshun brten pay paraparasambhavana). Tsongkhapa views this as a radical contrast with the first meaning of samvrti, i.e., as ignorance. The mutual interdependence of the two truths here is both epistemological and ontological. For Tsong­khapa, even ultimate truth, let alone all empirically given truths, should be classified as categories of samvrti in the sense of being mutually interde­pendent. Gorampa accepts that the second meaning of samvrti applies to empirical truth in both ontologically and epistemologically, but he adamantly denies it applies to ultimate truth. For him ultimate truth is ontologically transcendent—it cannot be samvrti at any level.Let us turn to Tsongkhapa first. If the term samvrti is taken to mean “mutually interdependent,” he argues, samvrti must apply exhaustively to all phenomena, including ultimate truth. At issue here is not merely the relation between phenomena and the apprehending consciousness; it is the ontological status of all phenomena. With respect to empirical or conven­tional truth, mutual interdependence entails an absence of essence. In other words, being mutually interdependent means that phenomena could not exist were they not relational and interdependent. “Since all phenomena arise through a network of causes and conditions, they are thereby empty of the self-defining characteristics.”220Mutual interdependence, in Tsongkhapas view, is not restricted to empi­rical truths alone. Samvrti in this sense refers also to the interdependence of ultimate truth and conventional truth. The mode of existence of ultimate"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEtruth is entirely dependent on its conventional counterpart. The two are like subject and predicate in that the latter cannot exist without the former and vice versa. In this sense paramarthasatya, ultimate truth, can be included in the categories of samvrti—not because it fulfills the defining criterion of samvrti, but because it is ontologically and epistemologically interdependent with conventional truth.The notion of classifying ultimate truth as samvrti is not sustainable, argues Tsongkhapa, if ultimate truth is given primacy—whether ontologi­cal or epistemological— over conventional truth. He himself accords para- mdrthasatya and samvrtisatya equal status. Paramarthasatya is the ultimate nature, or ultimate mode, of empirically given truths.221 Since ultimate truth is not possible without a characterized empirical object, para- marthasatya must be a dependently arisen phenomenon. Indeed, ultimate truth is none other than the ultimate mode of being of empirical truth. If paramarthasatyawzvz not a dependently arisen phenomenon, it would then be ontologically absolute and therefore essentially real. In that case, paramdrthasatyavfo\\A& be neither equivalent to an empty phenomenon nor categorizable as samvrti—a mutually interdependent phenomenon.Gorampa agrees with Tsongkhapa in recognizing empirical phenomena as mutually interdependent and as being dependently arisen and contin­gent. Gorampa explains sam as meaning “interdependent” (brten pa) or “relative” (Itospa) and vrti as “engaging” (jugpa)?11 The first two, interde­pendent and relative, reflect the idea of ontological interdependence, while the third, engaging, reflects the idea of epistemological interdependence. The point of contrast for Gorampa is that all interdependent phenomena, namely, all conventional and thus empirically given truths, are themselves the effects of ignorance— they arise as the result of ignorance. Although he takes samvrti to mean mutually interdependent, Gorampa privileges dependence of object on subject and hence relativity to the subject. Accord­ing to this view, the phenomenal world is ontologically dependent on the cognizing subject. Moreover, like Jayananda, Gorampa argues that igno­rance causally projects all empirical truths, either “through the impressions of primordial ignorance that conceives true existence,” or “due to familiar­ity with flawed philosophical systems.”223So far as interdependence is concerned, Gorampa sees conventional and ultimate truth as radically distinct—ultimate truth is not in any respect ontologically dependent or interdependent. Firstly, ultimate truth is not projected by primal ignorance, for it is the only nondeceptive truth. Sec­ondly, ultimate truth has ontological primacy over empirical truth. In other"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS55words, it is ontologically distinct and outranks empirical truth. Ultimate truth is ontologically free from the imperfections of empirical truths such as being conditioned, false, and deceptive, and thus also free of interde­pendence. It is ontologically transcendent and absolute. Hence, according to Gorampa, ultimate truth cannot in any circumstance constitute a cate­gory of samvrti. In endorsing such a view, Murti states, “ [Samvrti] may also mean the mutual dependence of things—their relativity. In this sense it is equated with phenomena, and is in direct contrast with the absolute which is, by itself, unrelated.”224 Similarly, Jaideva Singh states: “The Absolute comprehended through the categories of thought is phenomena and phe­nomena stripped of these categories are the Absolute.”225There is yet another important distinction between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. As far as the former is concerned, ontological interdependence perse is precisely what constitutes the paramarthasatyay the ultimate nature, of all phenomena. There is no paramdrthasatya of phenomena apart from their being dependently arisen. To know phenomena as dependently arisen is tantamount to knowing ultimate truth. Gorampa argues the incompati­bility of dependent arising and ultimate truth. The perception of phenom­ena as dependently arisen operates only under the spell of ignorance, whether deluded or nondeluded. Dependently arisen phenomena are ulti­mately reducible to the effects of ignorant consciousness, and hence cannot be the ultimate truth of any other phenomena.Samvrti as Worldly ConventionsThe Buddha said: “Good man, well said, well said! Just as you have said, the Buddhas, Tathagatas, say that there are sentient beings, and so forth, in order to conform to conventions, even though they know that there is actually no no-self, samsara, going, or coming. There is no dharma that can be nirvana either. However, in order to [cause others to] realize the dharma leading to nirvana, they discourse on nirvana.”226The third meaning of samvrti is worldly convention (jig rtengyi tha snyady lokavyavahdra)227 or “terms” (hrday sanket). This sense of samvrti, accord­ing to Tsongkhapa, encompasses the labels we give to things along with the six consciousnesses and their objective referents. As Candraklrti puts it, samvrti as worldly convention “has the characteristics of expression and expressed object, consciousness and object of consciousness, and so"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEforth.”228 Whereas the first meaning of samvrti specifically equates it with reifying ignorant consciousness, Tsongkhapa argues that in the third sense samvrti “must not be held to be merely subjective conventionalities—con­sciousness and expressions.”229 This third sense of samvrti encompasses all cognitive resources, namely, the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and intellect—their six corresponding objects—form, sound, aroma, taste, tactile objects, and ideas—and the six consciousnesses—visual, auditory, etc.— that arise from the contact between the six senses and the six objects.Gorampa agrees with Tsongkhapa on this meaning of samvrti, explain­ing that sam refers to sariket (brda), i.e., terms or expressions, while vrti means “to posit.” Samvrti therefore refers here to “conventionalities posited by terms or expressions.”230 The second and third meanings of samvrti— mutually interdependent and worldly conventions, respectively—in Gorampas view, are closely tied to the first meaning of samvrti. The whole system of worldly conventions— including cognizing consciousness, cog­nized objects, terms, and their referents, processes, events, etc.—are said to be the effects of ignorance, the first sense of samvrti. Without ignorance nei­ther the second nor the third meaning would be able to arise or make any sense. Gorampa also argues that samvrtisatya is so described because it is true only from the vantage point of ignorant consciousness; the first sense of samvrti is fundamental and overrides the significance of the other two. It is in this sense that objects are “conventional truths and are considered referents of linguistic conventions.”231This discussion concludes with a brief reflection on Tsongkhapas and Gorampas divergent readings of a crucial verse from Candrakirti s Madhya- makavatara:Because ignorance conceals the true nature, it is (i) samvrti.It conceives all conditioned phenomena as real.Thus, they are declared by [Sakya] muni as (2) samvrtisatya.All conditioned things are (3) samvrti.232For each of these three uses of the term samvrti, Tsongkhapa and Gorampa offer contrasting interpretations. Tsongkhapa maintains that the first use of the term differs significantly from the latter two uses, arguing that these uses “should not be taken as identical.”233 The first use of samvrti, he claims, refers to subjective consciousness, qua ignorance, as a concealer. Ignorance, Tsongkhapa holds, “is a samvrti because it is a reifying cognition"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS57that superimposes essential existence onto [contingent phenomena] by con­cealing the true mode of existence from being seen [by sentient beings].”234 As was pointed out earlier, when samvrti is understood with reference to samvrtisatya, literally “a truth-for-a-concealer,” the idea is, as Tsongkhapa puts it, “to identify [a specific] samvrti, i.e., a perspective to which the samvrti is being referred. However, strictly speaking this [identification] does not amount to identifying samvrti in a general sense.”235 Tsongkhapa avers that samvrti in this context refers specifically to an erroneous or a reify­ing cognition. Hence the first sense of samvrti employed by Candraklrti refers to a concealer, which is taken to mean “etymologically the same” (skad dod) as samvrti.236The second meaning of samvrti has two senses. It refers to essence as it is conceptually reified by ignorant consciousness, which, Tsongkhapa argues, is empirically nonexistent. It can also refer to the empirical phenomena that act as the basis for the reification process, for example, to the table that is itself reified as an essential phenomenon. The third samvrti, Tsongkhapa asserts, refers to all conventionalities in a much broader sense. All condi­tioned phenomena or dependently arisen phenomena, including ignorance itself and the conception of essence, come under the third category of samvrti. However, not all conventionalities satisfy the criterion of being conventional truth. As Tsongkhapa argues, “if something is a conventional truth, it must necessarily meet the criterion of empirical existence.”237 Igno­rance and all other dependently arising phenomena are conventional truths and are grounded in empirical evidence. While the essence projected by ignorance constitutes a conventional truth for ordinary beings, essence is not a conventional truth from the Madhyamaka standpoint. It does not meet the criterion of empirical truth. “It is thus unfounded even empiri­cally.”238 Therefore, as Candraklrti puts it, “[essence] and other things that are understood to be false even conventionally [e.g., the reflection of a face being an actual face, mirage being water, etc.,] are not considered as cate­gories of conventional truths.”239 Nonetheless, they are considered as cate­gories of conventionalities.Gorampas reading of same verse in the Madhyamakavatara is relatively straightforward in comparison with Tsongkhapas. He takes the first sense of samvrti to be synonymous with ignorance itself and the latter two as syn­onymous with the objects found or reified by such ignorance. In this respect, objects themselves are the essences, and there is no essence apart from what is empirically given. Dependently arisen phenomena, therefore, are the categories of objects that are projected by ignorance. In any case, as"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATETom Tillemans rightly suggests: “Whatever be the translation, it is impor­tant that samvrtisatya is not misunderstood as being just a purely conven­tional and arbitary agreement in the way in which the moons being called ‘that which has a rabbit' is just purely conventional agreement.” For both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa the term samvrti, while often translated into English as “conventionality,” does not mean mere conventions.240 Both hold the view that “What is true for the world, be it the impermanence of phenomena or the law of cause of effect, is so not just because of simple conventional agreements or arbitary words—whether we are Svatantrika or Prasangika, samvrtisatya is deeper than that.”241 The explanations of samvrti by Tibetans like Longchen Rabjam,242 Sakya Pandita,243 Shakya Chogden,244 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,245 and their modern counterpart, Murti246 largely accord with Gorampas interpretation. All of them treat primal igno­rance as the villain responsible for projecting the entire system of conven­tional truths. Consequently they also agree that the senses of samvrti as conventional and as interdependent are entirely dependent upon the first meaning of samvrti as ignorance.Concealers: The Soteriological Objects of NegationThe scope and role of ignorance is a central issue in any exploration of the three meanings of samvrti, and since the scope of the negative impact of ignorance is a crucial arena for Buddhists, we will briefly consider Tsong­khapas and Gorampas views on the soteriological objects of negation (lamgyi dgag bya).Both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa maintain that it is the presence of the soteriological objects of negation—namely, the two types of obstructors, or concealers (sgribpa, avaranas)—that prevent sentient beings from attaining correct knowledge, and so from attaining enlightenment. The concealers comprise so-called deluded concealers (mnyon sgrib, klestavaranas)dLW& non­deluded concealers (nyon rmongs can ma yin pai sgrib pa, aklestavarana). Nondeluded concealers are also called concealers of true knowledge (shes byayi sgrib pa, jneyavarana). These two types of concealers prevent cognizing beings from knowing phenomena as they actually are.Deluded concealers are comprised of three main elements: craving, aversion, and ignorance, the so-called three poisons. The last, deluded ignorance, plays the chief role in concealing reality through either actively reifying essences or passively conceiving them, and sometimes both in"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS59conjunction. Either way, deluded concealers distort the ultimate truth of processes, events, and phenomena.247The nondeluded concealers—concealers of true knowledge—are com­prised of the predispositions or imprints left on our minds by the deluded concealers. For both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa the concealers of true knowledge make cognizing beings vulnerable to the reifying influence of deluded ignorance.248 These subtle mental conditionings, unlike ignorance itself, do not themselves bring about active reification but are instead dis­positions that may passively persist even when the deluded concealers have been eradicated. Just as the smell of the onion remains even after the onion itself has been removed, so the concealers of true knowledge remain after the removal of the deluded concealers; and just as it is much easier to dis­pose of the onion than its smell, so the deluded concealer is easier to get rid of than the nondeluded one.Why are nondeluded concealers understood as ignorance? In Tsong­khapas case, it is to the extent that they obscure subtle realities from direct perception— thus they prevent an arya from grasping empty phenomena as empty or dependently arisen phenomena as dependently arisen. The non­deluded concealers thus constitute a form of ignorance even though they persist after the obliteration of deluded ignorance.Gorampa distinguishes between deluded and nondeluded concealers very differently. He adopts Jayanandas account according to which the types of ignorance are derived from different functions: “Ignorance is twofold, deluded and nondeluded. Deluded ignorance causes samsara by generating clinging toward I and mine, whereas nondeluded ignorance merely causes the appearances of physical forms, and so forth. But it is not the cause of the conception of true existence [i.e., essence].”249 The fact that the three types of aryas, according to Gorampa and Jayananda, “cognize dependently arisen phenomena as mere conventionalities akin to illusions, and so forth, is precisely because they are still under the influence of non­deluded ignorance.”250 This nondeluded ignorance is called nondeluded because “it does not conceive of true existence, and therefore it does not give rise to other delusions, such as craving.”251 So far as Gorampa and Jayananda are concerned, an enlightened being who has eradicated not only deluded concealers but also nondeluded concealers “does not have the per­ception of even mere conventionalities. Hence buddhas do not have any cognitive experience of phenomenal appearances such as that of blue color.”252Inasmuch as both deluded and nondeluded concealers are recognized as"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"6 oTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthe soteriological objects of negation, there is no apparent disagreement between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. Both vigorously argue for the negation of those concealers in order to attain the soteriological goal.Recognizing all phenomena as essentially empty and selfless, and thus as dependently arisen, necessarily requires the eradication of the deluded con­cealers. Without the eradication of active reifying tendencies, Tsongkhapa maintains, it is not possible to know the selflessness of persons (gang zag bdag med, pudgalanairatmya) or the selflessness of phenomena (chos kyi bdag med, dharmanairatmya). By eradicating the deluded concealers, and thereby coming to direct knowledge of persons and phenomena as selfless and empty, the practitioner first attains total liberation from delusions and becomes an arhat (Tib: dgra bcom pa—one who has totally destroyed the enemies within). Eradication of the nondeluded concealers leads to the attainment of freedom from even the subtlest epistemic errors and cogni­tive and psychological conditioning (bag chagsy vdsana). In Tsongkhapas view, thorough eradication of the soteriological objects of negation results in concurrent knowledge of the two truths. The chief consequence of erad­icating the nondeluded concealers is the realization of full enlightenment— one becomes a buddha.It is important to note that for Tsongkhapa the idea of essence, both of the self and of phenomena, is essentially an epistemic fabrication that also carries deep cognitive and psychological implications, and that it is a reification produced by deluded ignorance. As the Buddha says, “Monks, I do not envision even one other obstruction.. .like the obstruction of igno­rance.”253 By eradicating ignorance at the cognitive level, along with its latent predispositions at the psychological level, the selflessness of both per­sons and phenomena are likewise eradicated.Gorampa argues that the conception of the essential self of person is less subtle than that of phenomena. The deluded concealers are thus exclusively correlated with the conception of the essence of persons, whereas the con­cealers of true knowledge are correlated with the conception of the essence of phenomena.254 While the eradication of the deluded concealers leads to the knowledge of selflessness of persons, Gorampa views the eradication of the concealers of true knowledge as leading to the knowledge of emptiness of phenomena.255 Gorampa agrees with Tsongkhapa to the extent that the eradication of conception of the essential self of person does not require the eradication of empirical truths. But he denies that the eradication of the concealers of true knowledge, that is, the eradication of the idea of the essence of phenomena, is possible merely through cognitive or psychologi-"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"cal transformation. What is actually required is the eradication of the onto­logical structures of empirical truths.Thus, while Tsongkhapa maintains that eradicating the soteriological objects of negation does not eradicate empirical truths, Gorampa and his allies consistently argue that it does. Scholars such as Jayananda,256 Long- chen Rabjam,257 Rendawa,258 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,259 Taktsang Lot- sawa,260 Shakya Chogden,261 Mipham Rinpoche,262 and Gendlin Chopel,263 and their modern counterparts including Singh,264 Poussin265 Stcher- batsky,266 Lindtner,267 and Murti268—apart from some minor differences— all support Gorampas argument that the eradication of the idea of the self of persons entails the eradication of afflictive emotions such as craving, aversion, and ignorance, while the eradication of the idea of the essence of phenomena brings the total eradication of dependently arising phenomena, thus conventional truths. Therefore, according to this view, all conven­tional phenomena are soteriological objects of negation. For instance, Gendiin Chopel writes:In short, the appearances that are apparent to us as ordinary beings, and that cannot be done away with even by way of dis­secting into a thousand parts through the sevenfold reasonings, is itself the concealer for true knowledge. Or it is due to its power...The eradication of the deluded concealer culminates with the complete disappearance of the world of appearances from the perspective of conceptual mind while the eradication of the concealer of true knowledge culminates with complete dis­appearance [of the world of appearances] from the perspective of perceptual mind. Acarya Candraklrti therefore holds that a buddha, who has completely abandoned both concealers, expe­riences no such appearance...Inner clinging on to the table constitutes the deluded concealer, whereas the visual perception of the existence of the table constitutes the concealer of true knowledge.269For Gorampa the eradication of the two types of ignorance—deluded and nondeluded—must lead to the eradication of the entire system of a dependently arisen world. Since all dependently arisen phenomena are objects of negation, what is then left is ultimate reality alone.Tsongkhapa, on the other hand, argues that the eradication of the two types of ignorance cannot lead to the eradication of interdependentMEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS 61"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"phenomena, since they are not the objects of negation. In Helmut Tauscher’s words: “For Tsongkhapas understanding of conventional exis­tence (tha snyad duyodpa)y which relates to both realities, it is crucial that only absolute existence (don dam paryodpa) is to be negated, but not con­ventional reality (samvrtisatya) in the sense of conventionally real things or existence as such (yodpa tsam)y for this would imply either substantialism or nihilism.”270 Other modern scholarly works of Thupten Jinpa271 and Ruegg272 on Tsongkhapas position on the object of negation confirm that he does not treat conventionally existent phenomena as the object to be eradicated. Thus while Tsongkhapa argues that the eradication of the sote­riological objects of negation entails the eradication of delusions rather than the ontological structures of empirical truths, Gorampa argues that the eradication of the soteriological objects of negation necessarily eradicates both delusions and the ontological structures of empirical truths.The Meanings ofParamdrthasatyaThe most remarkable distinction between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa vis-a- vis the meaning of paramdrthasatya lies in the criterion they apply to deter­mine parama (dam pa), meaning “ultimate,” and artha (don)y meaning “object.” For Tsongkhapa “ultimate” qualifies arthay that is, the object as such, whereas for Gorampa it is the apprehending consciousness that is parama, or ultimate. For Tsongkhapa paramartha is the nature of both objects and the subjects that apprehend them, not something imposed upon the object by the subject. Gorampa argues that ultimate truth is none other than apprehending consciousness itself.We first consider Candraklrti s explanation of paramdrthasatya: “Because it is an object, at the same time it is the ultimate, it is the ultimate object, and because it is truth, it is the ultimate truth.”273 Commenting on Can- draklrtis statement, Tsongkhapa argues that within the compound term paramdrthasatya, satya, meaning truth, is that which is both artha, mean­ing object (yul, visaya), and parama, meaning ultimate. In this situation “both artha and parama are taken into account as the paramdrthasatya, meaning ultimate truth per se.”274 Parama is taken as the qualification of artha, the object, rather than the qualification of apprehending conscious­ness. In emphasizing this approach, Tsongkhapa is arguing that the mean­ing of paramdrthasatya is not purely epistemological. Whether or not phenomena are considered in relation to their respective apprehending6z THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATE"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"consciousnesses, the ultimate mode of the truth of phenomena doesn’t change.275 Tsongkhapa argues that ultimate truth is described as truth “because of its nondeceptive identity. Ultimate truth does not deceive sen­tient beings by presenting a mode of appearance that is different from its mode of being.”276 Conventional truth, on the other hand, does deceive ordinary sentient beings by presenting a mode of appearance that is contra­dictory to its mode of being.If the term ultimate qualified the apprehending consciousness rather than the phenomena themselves, ultimate truth would have to be taken as simply imposed on phenomena by the apprehending consciousness. This would mean, however, that the Buddha would then be mistaken when he claimed in the Dhammaniydma Sutta that “whether or not there is the aris­ing ofTathagatas, this property stands— this regularity of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: All processes are inconstant.. .All processes are dukkha...All phenomena are not-self.”277 Similarly, it would be erroneous for the Buddha to state in the Paccaya Sutta:Now, what is dependent co-arising? From birth as a requisite condition comes aging and death. Whether or not there is the arising ofTathagatas, this property stands— this regularity of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this this/that condi­tionality. The Tathagata directly awakes to that, breaks through to that. Directly wakening and breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, makes it plain and says, “Look. From birth as a req­uisite condition comes aging and death.”278Both these passages suggest that for the Buddha the ultimate mode of phe­nomena is objective and invariable rather than subjective and imposed.Unlike Tsongkhapa, Gorampa characterizes parama as a qualification of the apprehending consciousness, with artha as its corresponding object. The apprehending consciousness in this context refers to the very specific transcendent perspective (jig rten las 'daspaiye shes, lokottarajndna) that belongs to aryas. The meaning of paramarthasatya, in Gorampas view, grants primacy to the aryas transcendent wisdom, which supersedes the ontological status of conventional phenomena. In Gorampas words:Artha refers to reality (chos nyid, dharmata), i.e., the object of en­gagement of an aryas ultimate wisdom, for it is either cognizableMEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS 63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEor analyzable. Since there is no other object as supreme as this, it is the ultimate. It is [also] truth, for it is nondeceptive. Thus they are conjoined.279Note the similarities between Gorampas account of the meaning of para- marthasatya^Xid Jayanandas in his commentary on the Madhyamakavatara:Parama refers to transcendent wisdom, whereas arthay object, is its [apprehended] object, thus, [their conjunction forms] para- mdrtha, meaning ultimate object This is also satya (truth) because it is nondeceptive. Or,paramarthameans “supreme object” (mchog tu gyur bai don)y i.e., emptiness, for no other supreme object overshadows emptiness.280Both Jayananda and Gorampa consider parama as the ultimate qualification of an aryas transcendent wisdom and artha as a corresponding object of that consciousness. In this sense, the subjective consciousness determines ultimate truth. Since no empirical object enters the equation of ultimate truth, the term artha is, in Gorampas sense, more metaphorical than actual. “There is no realization and realized object, nor is there object and subject.”281 Taktsang Lotsawa is in agreement: “A wisdom without dual appearance is without any object.”282 Strictly speaking, transcendent wis­dom itself becomes the ultimate truth. And since ultimate truth is the aryas transcendent wisdom, paramdrthasatya cannot have the ontological status advanced by Tsongkhapa.The differences between Tsongkhapas and Gorampas analyses of the meaning of paramdrthasatya are a significant factor in their profoundly divergent views on what is divided into the two truths. For Tsongkhapa, the division rests on the dual natures of each empirically given truth. Two truths are posited precisely because they are equivalent to the conventional and ultimate natures of each and every empirical phenomenon. For Gorampa, the division is between subjectivities,283 and the two truths cannot be posited within the context of a particular empirical object. All empirical objects, according to him, have one and the same nature, and that nature is itself conventional truth. “Ultimate truth is to be experienced under a total cessation of dualistic appearance through an aryas personal wisdom,” and further, “Anything that has dualistic appearance, even omniscience, must not be treated as ultimate truth.”284 Longchen Rabjam,285 Sakya Pandita,280 Shakya Chogden,287 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,288 and Karmapa Mikyo"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Dorje289 all adopt Gorampas line of argument in insisting on equating ulti­mate truth with an aryas transcendent wisdom.So far we have examined the meanings attributed to samvrti and para- mdrthasatyay the nature and the scope of the objects of negation, and the significance of eradicating the objects of negation. In the second part of this chapter, an examination of Tsongkhapas and Gorampas respective posi­tions on the definitions of the two truths will further clarify the differences between them.MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS 65Definitions of the Two TruthsThe criteria for determining the definitions of the two truths are pivotal in contrasting the accounts of Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. Tsongkhapa claims the ontological status of each empirical phenomenon satisfies the definitions of both truths. Each phenomenon, as he sees it, possesses two natures that serve as the locus of the definitions of the two truths. Gorampa regards the ontological status of each empirical phenomenon as satisfying only the definition of conventional truth. He argues that each phenome­non has only an empirical nature rather than two natures, and that ultimate truth has a distinct ontological status.Tsongkhapa also claims that each cognitive agent is potentially capable of knowing both truths exhaustively, being equipped with the requisite empirically and ultimately valid cognitions. Gorampa argues that each truth must be verified by a different individual, and that access to the two truths is mutually exclusive—a cognitive agent who knows conventional truth cannot know ultimate truth and vice versa.CandrakirtVs Definition of the Two TruthsThere are two slightly varying definitions of the two truths that we should take into account at this point, offered by Candraklrti and Nagarjuna respectively. We will deal with Candraklrti s definitions in this section and Nagarjuna s in the next. In the sixth chapter of the Madhyamakavatara Can­draklrti defines the two truths as follows:[The Buddha] said that all things have two natures—Those found by perceivers of reality and [those found by perceivers] of falsities (brdzun pa)."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"6 6THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEObjects of perceivers of reality are things as they are;Objects of perceivers of falsities are conventional truths.290Gorampa reads brdzun pa as modifying the perceiver as “false.” However, as Guy Newland notes, Tsongkhapa reads brdzun pa as a. reference to the perceived object and not the perceiver.291 Consequently, Tsongkhapa de­fines conventional truth as an object “found by an empirically valid cogni­tion that perceives false objects of knowledge,”292 and defines ultimate truth as “an object found by reasoning consciousness perceiving, seeing real­ity.”293 In his commentary to Nagarjunas Mulamadhyamakakarika, Tsong­khapa applies these two definitions with respect to the two natures of the sprout:Each individual phenomenon— exterior or interior294—pos­sesses dual natures—one of the ultimate and the other of the empirical. Consider the sprout, for example: it possesses a nature that is found by a reasoning consciousness perceiving reality, i.e., a nondeceptive knowable; and a nature that is found by an empirical consciousness perceiving a deceptive object, i.e., a false knowable. The former is the sprouts nature of ultimate truth, and the latter, the sprouts nature of empirical truth.295A crucial point to be noted in Tsongkhapas definition is his insistence on grounding the two truths in the two natures of each individual phenome­non. Candraklrti remarks similarly: “The bhagavan buddhas, who flaw­lessly mastered the defining characteristics of each of the two truths, have shown that all phenomena, i.e., interior and exterior, such as conditioned phenomena and a sprout, have two natures.”296Two central ideas are embedded in Candrakirtis and Tsongkhapas grounding of the two truths on the two natures of each phenomenon. Firstly, the two truths are conceptual distinctions applied to a particular empirical phenomenon, since every phenomenon fulfills the criterion of both truths. Secondly, the two truths should not be construed as merely one specific nature of a phenomenon mirrored in two different perspectives. As each phenomenon, according to them, possesses two natures, so each veri­fying consciousness has a different nature as its referent, even though there is only one ontological structure involved. The two truths, argues Tsong­khapa, “indicate that if the characteristics of even one ontological struc­ture— the sprout, for example—are divided, it has two natures, namely,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"conventional and ultimate. It does not however indicate that one nature per se is divided into the two truths with respect to [the contrasting perspec­tives] of ordinary beings and the aryas.”297Hence Tsongkhapa holds that a single ontological identity—a sprout, for instance—has two natures. Its conventional nature is its deceptive or false nature—it appears to have a self-sufficient existence while in reality it is a dependently arisen phenomenon. The ultimate nature of the sprout, how­ever, is nondeceptive, appearing to its apprehending consciousness the way it actually exists.Gorampa is equally convinced that Candraklrti supports his view that the two truths are to be associated with two different perspectives. In arriv­ing at this reading, Gorampa juxtaposes verses 6:23 and 6:28 of Candraklrti s Madhyamakdvatdra. The first of these verses defines the two truths, whereas the second deals with the different senses of samvrti. Gorampa regards the phrase brdzun pa mtbong ba, meaning “perceiver of falsities,” in verse 6:23 as synonymous with gti mugy meaning “ignorance,” or “concealer,” in verse 6:28. Similarly, he treats kun rdzob bden pa, “conventional truth as grasped by the perceiver of falsities,” in verse 6:23, as synonymous with kun rdzob, “ignorance” or “concealer,” in verse 6:28.Like Huntington, who translates yang dag mtbong pa as “correct percep­tion” rather than “perceiver of reality,” and mtbong ba brdzun pa as “incor­rect perception” instead of “perceiver of falsity,” Gorampa reads brdzun pa (falsity) as an adjective referring to a perceiver as opposed to a perceived object.298 The equating of correct perception with perceiver of reality, and incorrect perception with perceiver of falsity, plays a vital role in Gorampas definition of the two truths. It allows him to argue that the underlying basis for the differentiation between the two truths is indeed a matter of conflict­ing perspectives:Since it is the cognition that grasps the two natures, ultimate truth is an object of a reality-perceiving cognition (mtbong ba yang dag) whereas conventional truth is an object of a falsity- perceiving cognition (mtbong ba brdzun pa,).299When the Bhagavan Buddha disclosed reality as it is to his disciples from the empirical standpoint, he demonstrated that all phenomena are constitutive of the two natures—conven­tional and ultimate. And the doctrine of the two truths is based on the empty nature of all phenomena found by the wisdom of an aryas meditative equipoise, and the existent nature found byMEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS 6j"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthe power of falsity—the false-perceiving cognition of ordinary beings.300But then he states:Here in the Madhyamaka system, the object itself cannot be divided into two truths. Empirical truth and ultimate truth are divided in terms of the mode of apprehension: in terms of the sub­ject apprehending falsehood and subject apprehending truthy or mis­taken and unmistaken apprehension, or deluded and undeluded apprehension, or erroneous and nonerroneous apprehension, or valid and invalid cognitions.301All the Prasangikas and the Svatantrikas of India agree that [the two truths] are posited by the object-possessing mind. Because the two truths are posited in terms of the subjective mind, they depend on whether it is deluded or nondeludedy a per­ception of falsity or a perception of truth, or a mistaken or an unmis­taken cognition,.302Although the first two paragraphs are somewhat ambiguous and do not expressly highlight distinctive features of Gorampas view, the third and the fourth set forth the characteristic features with considerable clarity. As far as Gorampa is concerned, the definition of the two truths is entirely deter­mined by the two contradictory cognitive perspectives associated with ignorance on the one hand, and wisdom on the other.Gorampa also rejects Tsongkhapas object-based definition explicitly:[If it were true that each phenomenon has two natures], it would absurdly follow that even one particular phenomenon, such as a sprout, must possess [two] empirically retrievable imputed objects [or natures] merely by designating the two truths. This must follow, for the sprout would have two natures, which would be the bases of the two truths. [If you accept this], it would then follow that the object found by the false-perceiving consciousness must also be absurdly found by an aryas meditative equipoise.This must follow because [according to you] the object [verified by the false-perceiving consciousness] would be affirmatively grasped by the reality-perceiving consciousness since the two [apprehended] objects have a single ontological identity.303"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS69Furthermore he states:The conventional nature of the sprout would absurdly become its ultimate nature, for the two [natures] have only one [phenome­nal] characteristic. If you accept this, then it would follow that the nature verified by the false-perceiving consciousness would also be absurdly the nature verified by the reality-perceiving conscious­ness. If you accept this, it would then follow what is to be verified by the false-perceiving consciousness must absurdly be found by the reality-perceiving consciousness. If you accept this, then it must follow that these two [verifying cognitions] are not different insofar as their modes of verifying the natures of objects.304While these two passages directly criticize Tsongkhapas account of the two natures, they also shed light, albeit indirectly, on Gorampas own definition. Gorampa argues that each empirical phenomenon has only one nature, namely, its conventional nature. The so-called ultimate nature, in his view, cannot be verified in any empirical phenomenon. If a sprout, for example, actually did possess two natures as proposed in Tsongkhapas definition, then, according to Gorampa, each nature would have to be ontologically distinct. Since the ontological structure of the sprout cannot be separated into a so-called conventional and ultimate nature, the sprout must possess only one phenomenal nature, i.e., the conventional. As this nature is found only under the spell of ignorance, it can be verified only under the empiri­cal cognitions of ordinary beings, and of unenlightened aryas not in medi­tative equipoise. This would be absurd because ultimate truth is totally beyond the reach of ordinary beings.The two passages cited above also demonstrate, of course, that the defi­ning characteristics of the two truths cannot, in Gorampas view, be posited from within the framework of empirically given phenomena alone. Any such phenomenon can only satisfy the definition of conventional truth. The ontological status of the sprout, as sprout, is understood in terms of conventional truth, for it is false and deceptive. The ultimate truth of the sprout is beyond its conventional existence, beyond its existence merely as sprout. It is therefore not possible, in Gorampas view, to confine the defi­nition of ultimate truth to the framework of empirical phenomena.Ultimate truth, for Gorampa, requires the metaphysical transcendence of empirical or conventional existence. Unlike conventional phenomena, it is neither presupposed nor projected by ignorance. Ultimate truth “is inexpress-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"70THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEible through words and is beyond the scope of mind.”305 The mind, as Gorampa understands it, is always conceptual and thus deluded. “Yet ulti­mate truth,” as he argues, “is experienced by aryas in their meditative equipoise, and is free from all conceptual categories. It cannot be expressed through definition, through any defined object, or through anything else.”306 Lindtner summarizes this view: “Reality (tattva) is beyond all ontological and epistemological dualities (dvaya)y while the empirical world of origination, destruction, and so forth is illusory—due merely to ignorance (avidya)”5Q1 Another important issue is the way Gorampa characterizes verifying cog­nitions. He agrees with Tsongkhapa on the need for two different cognitive resources—reality-perceiving cognition and falsity-perceiving cognition. Both thinkers agree that reality-perceiving cognition verifies ultimate reality, whereas falsity-perceiving cognition verifies conventional truth.308 This agreement is, however, superficial. In contrast with Tsongkhapa, who argues that each cognitive agent may possess both cognitive modes, Gorampa argues that an enlightened being and an ordinary being have distinct cogni­tive modes. The only possible exception, for Gorampa, is the arya that is not yet fully enlightened; such beings can access both types of consciousness. This general line of argument appears to originate directly from Jayananda:Perceivers of reality consist of the bhagavan buddhas, who flawlessly understand the natures of things. [Ultimate] reality comprises their [apprehended] objects. However, their appre­hended objects and subjects are comprised of unperceived objects and [unperceived] subjects... Perceivers of falsities are erroneous, for they do not realize reality. Besides, they grasp on to false things. Objects that they apprehend are conventional truths.309Jayananda argues that an enlightened being perceives only ultimate truth and possesses only transcendent wisdom. Ultimate truth is an object certified by transcendent wisdom. As Lindtner puts it, however, “the ulti­mate truth is the object of a cognition without an object (advayajnana)y and thus only an object metaphorically speaking (upadayaprajnaptiJ.”310 Yet ultimate truth, “as it is beyond all categories of thoughts, is cognitively expe­rienced without duality of subject and object.”311 And “in the ultimate con­text,” says Jayananda, “there is not even the slightest existence of object and subject.”312 These arguments are all in line with Gorampas.Thus for Tsongkhapa, the two natures of each empirical phenomenon define the two truths, while Gorampa considers wisdom and ignorance as"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the defining characteristics. Siding with Gorampa are Longchen Rabjam,313 Sakya Pandita,314 Rendawa,315 Mipham Rinpoche,316 Shakya Chogden,317 Taktsang Lotsawa,318 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,319 Karmapa Mikyo Dorje,320 and Gendiin Chopel,321 all of whom formulate the definitions of the two truths in terms of the distinctions between the ignorant experiences of ordinary beings and the enlightened experiences of an aryas wisdom. In like fashion, the definitions offered by modern interpreters such as Murti,322 Singh,323 Poussin,324 Huntington,325 and Williams326 all ground the two truths in these two contradictory viewpoints.Huntington and Williams, although emphasizing perception as the basis of the distinction, nevertheless attempt to preserve the compatibility between emptiness and dependent arising. “Emptiness,” as Huntington puts it, “must resonate far down into the core of everyday experience.”327 Similarly, Williams argues that “emptiness and dependent origination mutually imply each other.”328 In arguing thus, Williams and Huntington seem to be straddling two contradictory positions, with one foot in Gorampas camp and the other in Tsongkhapas. Were empirical truth purely reified by delusory perceptions, then Huntington and Williams would have to deny that enlightened beings can perceive dependently arisen phenomena. Claiming that emptiness and dependently arisen phenomena are mutually entailing, on the other hand, means that an enlightened being, lacking any experience of dependently arisen phenomena, could have no cognitive experience of emptiness. Huntington and Williams must either relinquish their commitment to a mutual entailment, or else relinquish their definition of the two truths as based in incompatible cognitive capac­ities and experiences. They cannot plausibly retain both commitments. Neither Tsongkhapa nor Gorampa faces this dilemma.To summarize: Tsongkhapa and Gorampa read Candraklrtis definition of the two truths differently. Tsongkhapa considers the two natures of each phenomenon as the key factor. The conventional nature of an empirical phenomenon, as verified by an empirically valid consciousness, determines the definition of conventional truth; the ultimate nature of the same empir­ical phenomenon, as verified by an ultimately valid consciousness, deter­mines the definition of ultimate truth. Since both truths are ontologically as well as epistemologically interdependent, knowledge of empirically given phenomena as dependently arisen suffices for knowledge of both truths. Gorampa, as we have seen, rejects Tsongkhapas dual-nature account, treat­ing each empirical phenomenon as satisfying only the definition of conven­tional truth and taking the definition of ultimate truth to be ontologicallyMEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS JI"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"7*THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEand epistemologically distinct from conventional truth. It is through the perception of either an ordinary being or an unenlightened arya that the definition of conventional truth is verified—fully enlightened beings do not verify the defining characteristics of conventional truth in any respect. Similarly, no ordinary being can verify the definition of ultimate truth. Ultimate truth transcends conventional truth, and the knowledge of empirically given phenomena as dependently arisen could not satisfy the criterion of knowing ultimate truth.Nagarjunas Definition of the Two Truths Let us now consider Nagarjunas view:Not to be realized from the other, peaceful,Not elaborated by elaborations,Not conceptualized, and not a separate identity.That is the characteristic of [ultimate] reality.329Tsongkhapa comments thus on this statement:[Ultimate truth] is not to be realized from another. Other per­sons can merely explain it, but cannot [make another person] directly realize it. Instead, it is to be personally realized through an undefiled wisdom. It is peaceful. Just as a person without cataracts does not see falling hairs, [ultimate truth] is free from inherent essence. It cannot thus be elaborated through the vocal elaborations, meaning, it cannot be expressed. “Conceptualiza­tion” refers to the operations of mind. At the point when the true nature of things as they are is consummated, the operations of mind temporarily cease. It is thus not conceptualized. However a phenomenon fulfills the criterion of ultimate truth, [the ulti­mate truth] of all other phenomena have the same identity. Thus, from the ultimate standpoint, there are no separate identities.330Next Gorampas comments:Ultimate truth cannot be realized as it actually is by naive ordi­nary beings by means of the others explanations or logical rea­sons. Instead, it is realized by an aryas personal wisdom within"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS73meditative equipoise by way of not seeing anything at all. Since nothing is established primordially, it is peaceful. Since it is not an object to be expressed through vocal elaboration by way of clinging to it, [ultimate truth] is not elaborated. It is beyond the scope of mind and mental factors, thus no conception whatso­ever can conceptualize it. Since no distinction whatsoever exists, there are no separate identities. These fivefold features are thus the defining characteristics of the reality of ultimate truth.331Except for some minor linguistic differences, Tsongkhapa and Gorampa render Nagarjunas statement in terms that appear, on the face of it, to be virtually identical. A closer look at these two interpretations, however, reveals that they imply quite different and irreconcilable conclusions.Gorampa interprets Nagarjunas account on the assumption that Nagarjuna is making metaphysical claims about the nature of ultimate truth. Given Gorampas commitment to a conception of ultimate truth as ontologically, epistemologically, and soteriologically transcendent of con­ventional truth, this is not surprising. In fact, Gorampa goes so far as to combine the definition of ultimate truth with that of essence (rang bzhin, svabhava). In his commentary on the Mulamadhyamakakarika, in the chap­ter on the Analysis of Essence [15:2], Gorampa contentiously identifies ulti­mate truth with the defining characteristics of essence:[Question]: But what is the nature of the reality of phenomena? [Reply]: It is not possible to reveal its exact nature. However, to facilitate its understanding by the disciples, the real nature of phenomena is disclosed as the apprehended domain of the uncontaminated wisdom. Its nature has three defining character­istics: namely, it is not created by causes and conditions; it exists independently of conventions and of other phenomena; and it does not change. The reality of the transcendence of conceptual elaboration is its example.332Gorampas commitment to the absolute characterization of ultimate truth is nowhere expressed so overtly as here, where he uses Nagarjunas definition of essence as a means to define ultimate truth. Like Nagarjunas hypotheti­cal essence, Gorampa argues that ultimate truth is ontologically uncondi- tioned, and hence it is not a dependently arisen phenomenon; it is distinct from empirical phenomena in every sense of the word; it is independent of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEconceptual-linguistic conventions; it is an absolutely timeless and eternally unchanging phenomenon. Reading Gorampas interpretation of Nagar­juna s definition of ultimate truth against this background, it becomes apparent that for him Nagarjunas statement [18:9] is only concerned with metaphysically unitary and ineffable ultimate truth.Gorampa applies the same metaphysical interpretation to the Buddhas following statement on ultimate truth:There is, monks, an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unfabricated.If there were not that unborn.. .there would not be the case that emancipation from the born, become, made, fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn...eman­cipation from the born...is thus discerned. The born, become, produced, made, fabricated, impermanent, composed of aging and death, a nest of illness, perishing, come from nourishment, and the guide [that is craving] is unfit for delight. The freedom from that is calm, permanent, beyond inference, unborn, unpro­duced, the sorrowless, stainless state, the cessation of stressful qualities, the stilling of fabrications, bliss.333And as the Buddha also states:Freed, dissociated, and released from ten things, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness, Vahuna. Which ten? Freed, dissociated and released from form...feeling...perception... processes.. .consciousness.. .birth.. .aging.. .death.. .dukkha... defilement, he dwells with unrestricted awareness. Just as a red, blue, or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it, in the same way the Tathagata—freed, dissociated, and released from these ten things— dwells with unrestricted awareness.334For Tsongkhapa Nagarjunas definition and the Buddhas statements do not in any way present an account of the metaphysically transcendent nature of ultimate truth—although they have ontological implications, they directly attend to psychological, cognitive, and epistemic issues related to the experi­ential nature of ultimate truth. Since it is not possible for ultimate truth to be known merely by another’s verbal explanations, so, Tsongkhapa argues, it is experienced personally within ones own psychophysical aggregates by"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS75ones own valid consciousness. In Kalupahanas words: “It is knowledge for which one does not depend upon another, primarily because it pertains to arising and ceasing of empirical phenomena. It involves personal verification, a verification that can be accomplished by someone before one begins to formulate any right view.”335 In this sense not only is ultimate truth beyond linguistic descriptions but it is also beyond the conceptual mind. Thus the Buddha explains how ultimate truth (here referring to nirvana) is transcendently experienced:Monks, that sphere should be realized where the eye (vision) stops and the perception (mental noting) of form fades. That sphere is to be realized where the ear stops and the perception of sound fades.. .where the nose stops and the perception of aroma fades...where the tongue stops and the perception of flavor fades.. .where the body stops and the perception of tactile sensa­tion fades...where the intellect stops and the perception of idea/phenomena fades: That sphere should be realized.336To put the above considerations into clearer perspective, let us consider one final point: the relationship between the concept of dependent arising and the concept of ultimate truth. In highlighting the nature of dependent aris­ing, Nagarjuna states:Whatever arises in dependence upon whatever Is neither identical to it Nor different from it.It is, therefore, neither annihilated nor eternal.337Tsongkhapa reads this statement as Nagarjunas definition of worldly or mun­dane reality (jig rten pa’i de kho na nyid kyi mtshan nyid)P* while Gorampa interprets it as the definition of conventional reality (kun rdzob kyi de kho na nyid).339 Although there is a sharp difference in their usage of the terms at issue here—mundane versus conventional reality—this is not the key issue. In fact, both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa tend to use these two expressions interchangeably. In this context the focus is on what Tsongkhapa and Gorampa aim to achieve by means of their respective readings. By taking verse 18:10 as a definition of worldly or mundane reality, Tsongkhapa draws a contrast with verse 18:9, in which Nagarjuna defines transworldly or supra- mundanereality (jig rten las ydaspai de kho na nyid). In making this contrast,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATETsongkhapa is also contrasting the truth verified by empirically valid con­sciousness (worldly or mundane consciousness) with truth verified by ulti­mately valid consciousness (supramundane or transcendent consciousness). In treating verse 18:10 as defining conventional reality, Gorampa, however, aims to contrast the truth verified by ignorance (incorrect perception) with the truth verified by wisdom (transcendent mind).Although Tsongkhapa and Gorampa both apply the principle of depend­ent arising, and therefore of emptiness, to the most crucial issues—the com­patibility between emptiness and dependent arising—the differences between their two positions are irreconcilable. Tsongkhapa mobilizes the principle of dependent arising, and so of emptiness, to establish the ulti­mate truth of all phenomena as dependently arisen, and therefore as empty. Gorampa on the other hand moblizes the principle of dependent arising and emptiness to argue that ultimate truth is not dependently arisen and therefore not empty.For Tsongkhapa, just as there is an essential compatibility between dependently arisen and empty phenomena, so, too, is there an essential compatibility between the two truths. As dependently arisen, empty phe­nomena are not constructions of ignorant consciousness, so neither is con­ventional truth such a construction. Both truths are actual truths that stand on an equal footing. Moreover, according to this view, whosoever knows conventional truth, either directly or inferentially, also knows ultimate truth; whosoever knows ultimate truth, also knows phenomena as depend­ently arisen, and hence knows them as empty. Where there is no knowledge of conventional truth, the converse applies. For Gorampa, the incommen­surability between dependently arisen and empty phenomena also applies to the two truths. Accordingly, whosoever knows conventional truth does not know ultimate truth, and one who knows ultimate truth does not know conventional truth; whosoever knows phenomena as dependently arisen does not know them as empty, whereas whosoever knows phenomena as empty does not know them as dependently arisen.Let us briefly review. Granting ultimate truth a metaphysically independ­ent status, Gorampa interprets both Nagarjunas definition and the Bud­dhas statements as demonstrations of its metaphysically unconditioned and transcendent nature. This allows him to formulate ultimate truth as onto­logically absolute and to deny the credibility of dependently arisen phe­nomena. Since ultimate truth is transcendent of empirical truth in every sense, so, as Murti puts it, “the absolute is beyond the scope of discursive thought, language, and empirical activity...It is in fact the unutterable"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"MEANINGS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE TWO TRUTHS77(anabhilapya), the unthinkable, unteachable.”340 Since Tsongkhapa main­tains the mutual interlocking of the two truths, he argues that both Nagarjuna and the Buddhas positions on ultimate truth do not, in anyway, affirm the metaphysical or transcendent ontological status of such truth. The Buddha and Nagarjunas statements, as Tsongkhapa sees the matter, point instead to the transcendent experience of the very same empirically given phenomenon (i.e. ones own psychophysical aggregates) as realized by means of valid consciousness. Thus Nagarjuna writes: “Without relying upon empirical (truth), the meaning of the ultimate cannot be disclosed. Without realizing the meaning of the ultimate, nirvana is not attained,”341 and he adds: “Samsara and nirvana do not exist as two [individuals]. The exhaustive knowledge of samsara is itself defined as nirvana.”342ConclusionTsongkhapas and Gorampas definitions of the two truths are irreconcil­able. This is most apparent in their respective accounts of the term samvrti. Excluding essence superimposed by ignorance (i.e., a concealer), Tsong­khapa argues that all empirically given truths (tha snyad bden pa, vyavaharikasatya) or conventional truths (kun rdzob bden pa, samvrtisatya) are not posited by ignorance. Therefore empirical truths do not arise as a result of ignorance. Gorampa argues that all empirically given truths and their experiences, either perceptually or conceptually, are ultimately reducible to the effects of ignorance since they are wholly posited by igno­rance. Whether the phenomenal world is described in terms of conven­tional truth or empirical truth, or even in terms of dependently arisen phenomena, so far as he is concerned, it is only under the spell of ignorance that we experience the empirical world.Regarding their positions on the cognitive agents of the two truths, Tsongkhapa not only categorizes aryas and buddhas as the appropriate cognitive agents of ultimate truth, but he also allows that ordinary beings who are conceptually familiar with the Madhyamaka philosophy may be categorized in this way. Each cognitive agent, according to Tsongkhapa, is equipped with the necessary cognitive and epistemic resources—both ulti­mately valid and empirically valid consciousness— to verify both truths, and this is so despite the fact that the truths may be realized either directly or inferentially. In clear contrast, Gorampa refuses to accept ordinary beings as cognitive agents of ultimate truth or buddhas as cognitive agents"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"78THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof conventional truth. As he sees it, no ordinary being is able to realize ulti­mate truth and no buddha experiences conventional truth.Since Tsongkhapa bases his definition of the two truths on the two natures of all empirically given phenomena, and treats empirically valid and ulti­mately valid consciousness as their determining criteria, the two truths are not reducible to contradictory perspectives. Although the defining charac­teristics of the two truths are verified through separate epistemic pathways, they are nonetheless everywhere inextricably conjoined. Thus the two truths, according to Tsongkhapa, stand on an equal epistemological and ontologi­cal footing. This allows him to argue that knowledge of conventional truth requires knowledge of ultimate truth and vice versa. The equal status of the two truths also facilitates Tsongkhapas argument that knowledge of phe­nomena as dependently arisen amounts to knowing phenomena as essen­tially empty, and that the converse also holds. Gorampa grounds the definition of the two truths on the two contradictory perspectives associated with the cognitive experiences of ordinary beings on the one hand, and those of aryas on the other. Conventional truths are reducible to ignorance while ultimate truth is equated with transcendent wisdom. As ordinary beings are deluded beings, their experiences are, in their entirety, based on conventional truth, and thus they have strictly no access to ultimate truth. Fully enlight­ened beings, however, experience ultimate truth exclusively.Closely tied to the meanings and definitions of the two truths is the nature and scope of the objects of negation—concealers—a major point of disagreement between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. The implications of exactly how the objects of negation are understood have reverberated throughout this chapter. It is apparent that the meanings and definitions of the two truths proposed by Tsongkhapa and Gorampa are derived from their views regarding the objects of negation. As we have seen, Gorampa identifies empirical senses, their corresponding objects, and resultant con­sciousnesses, as the objects of negation, or, to be precise, as “concealers.” Tsongkhapa categorically disagrees."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"3. Language, Concepts, and Ultimate TruthIntroductionIn t h i s c h a p t e r we compare the two Tibetan Prasangika accounts by asking: Is ultimate truth an object of knowledge of the conceptual mind (thought)? At issue here is whether ultimate truth is linguistically express­ible and conceptually knowable. The first and second sections will analyze the limits of both language and conceptual mind in relation to ultimate truth, with particular reference to the often-cited “cataract” analogy. In the third section we will analyze the validity and significance of the conceptual “right view”—which is closely related to the issues concerning the limits of lan­guage and conceptual mind.The analysis of the conceptual right view is important for two reasons. Firstly, its validity is closely connected to the capacity of conceptual mind to make the ultimate truth intelligible. Secondly, the idea of the right view is a central tenet in the Buddhist account of the path to perfection. The Buddha himself considers the right view as the forerunner of all spiritual practices. Such analysis will also enable us to clearly distinguish between Tsongkhapas and Gorampas views on the limits of the conceptual mind. It will also set the stage for the next chapter, which looks at the nonconceptual or experiential right view.The Limits of Language and the Conceptual Mind: The Cataract Analogy and Its ApplicationsIn much of the Madhyamaka philosophical literature the ineffability and inconceivability of ultimate truth is illustrated by employing, as an analogy, the contrast between impaired and healthy vision. For example, Can­draklrti states in the Madhyamakavatara: “Due to cataracts (or opthalmia),7 9"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"8oTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEone sees illusions such as falling hairs, which are false with respect to the object. One with clear vision sees them as they are. [The perception of ulti­mate truth] must be understood in this way.”343 In commenting on this metaphor, Tsongkhapa344 and Gorampa345 agree that a person with cataracts might see hairs falling from the sky while the person with clear vision will see nothing of the sort. If someone with normal vision tells a visually impaired person “no hair is falling from the sky,” that persons acceptance of the statement will nevertheless not prevent him from seeing the hairs. On this Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree, but they disagree on its interpre­tation and, in particular, on whether the person with impaired vision would really understand the nonexistence of the hairs.For both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa, the fact that mere assent to the illu­soriness of a sensation does not typically prevent the illusion from being experienced indicates the limited power of language over our cognitive and perceptual processes, and thus also the limited power and role of concep­tual mind.A visually impaired person might understand the illusory character of the falling hairs, but he cannot perceive their nonexistence directly. The expe­rience of falling hairs persists. The only solution— in the case of falling hairs— is to be cured of the cataracts. Conceptual understandings not suffi­cient to the task. On the other side of the equation, the person whose vision is not impaired but who is unable to convey his conceptual understanding demonstrates the limits of linguistic expression.So far as Tsongkhapa is concerned, a person with cataracts can form some conceptual understanding of the illusory character of the falling hairs by hearing an explanatory account of their illusoriness. Similarly, when ordi­nary beings listen to explanations concerning ultimate reality, they too can form some conceptual understanding of ultimate truth. Gorampa argues that a person with cataracts cannot form any understanding of the illusory nature of the falling hairs; such an understanding would actually require direct experience of the reality—that is, visual experience free of the illu­sory falling hairs. In the same way, he argues, ordinary beings cannot form any understanding concerning ultimate reality by merely listening to expla­nations—only an arya, who directly experiences ultimate reality, can develop such an understanding.346With the cataract analogy, both Gorampa and Tsongkhapa treat the cog­nitive abilities of ordinary beings on the model of impaired visual faculties, and the cognitive capacities of fully enlightened beings on the model of unimpaired visual faculties. The cognitive ability of ordinary beings is"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"obscured by the presence of primal ignorance just as vision is impaired by the presence of cataracts. Moreover, just as a visually impaired person does not have direct access to the nonillusory visual experience, neither does an ordinary person have direct access to ultimate truth. Even a fully enlight­ened being will be unable to provide an ordinary being with the ability to perceive directly the nonexistence of essences.The differences between ordinary and enlightened beings can be further elucidated through considering the limits of language. Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree that the power of language is quite limited when it comes to expressing the nature of ultimate reality. Language depends upon linguis­tic convention, but ultimate reality goes beyond those conventions. More­over linguistic discourse only makes complete sense when the listeners already have a certain degree of familiarity with what is being expressed, or the expressions used. Their ability to make sense of what is being said is thus dependent on prior knowledge.Suppose the person with cataracts was born that way and has never seen the world without the illusion of hairs. This person cannot fully grasp the nonexistence of the hairs since he lacks any perceptual reference. The case is exactly the same for ordinary persons who have never had any experience of ultimate reality free from essences. The linguistic expressions used to explain ultimate reality only convey their full sense when the listener has had some direct experience of it. Inasmuch as ultimate reality is unknown to ordinary beings, linguistic discourse alone cannot fully bridge the gap between what is known and what is unknown to an ordinary being. In this sense, ultimate truth remains inexpressible. Explaining this limits to the Venerable Mahakotthita, the Venerable Sariputra states: “As far, friend, as the six bases of sense contact (phassdyatana) reach, so far reaches the (explainable) world of diffuseness (papanca); and as far as the world of dif­fuseness reaches, so far reach the six bases of sense contact. Through the entire fading away and cessation of the six bases of sense contact, the world of diffuseness ceases and is stilled.”347If language is strictly inadequate to transmit the cognition of ultimate reality from one person to another, how does an ordinary person gain any understanding of ultimate reality whatsoever? Does the conceptual mind allow for some kind of grasp of ultimate truth? The answer depends on ones interpretation of the limits of conceptual thought and inference.

In fact, he considers conceptual understanding as a steppingLANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH 8l"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEstone to direct realization. Gorampa argues that the conceptual mind has no capacity whatsoever to comprehend ultimate reality. “Ordinary beings,” he asserts, “simply cannot understand ultimate reality, through listening to another’s words, through reasoning, or through any other means.”348 Ulti­mate reality “cannot be elaborated through vocal expressions; hence it is beyond verbal elaborations. And it is also beyond the comprehension of mind and mental factors; no conceptual thought whatsoever can possibly encompass it.”349 As Gorampa sees it, ordinary beings are not cognitive agents of ultimate truth and are totally incapable of understanding ultimate reality. Hence listening to a discourse on ultimate reality cannot lead ordi­nary beings to comprehend ultimate reality. If, for some reason, they man­age to form some ideas through inference, those ideas, and the knowledge that they comprise, must be thoroughly incoherent. “Go rams pa holds that...the actual ultimate is not accessible to thought and is thus utterly ineffable,” writes Dreyfus.350 Strictly speaking, the conceptual cognitions of ordinary beings are, according to Gorampa, completely inadequate to the task of comprehending ultimate reality.The claim that conceptual cognition cannot access ultimate truth is based in large part on the fact that such cognition depends upon universah. Gorampa argues that “any cognition analyzing the nature of reality is sim­ply the conceptual thought grasping at a conjunctive compound of the term [universal] (sgra spyi) and the object universal (don spyiA”351 Conceptual thought is understood by Gorampa as comprising both conceptual/percep- tual awareness and universals. The term universal is the concept of an object formed as a result of listening to descriptions of the object without actually seeing it. The object universal' on the other hand, is the concept of an object formed as result of seeing the object without having had any prior knowl­edge of it. Taken independently, neither universal makes much sense, since the former is description without reference, and the latter reference with­out description. Gorampa argues that these two universals work together to make language and thought function.Conceptual thought, moreover, functions strictly within the conven­tional domain. It has no access whatsoever to ultimate truth since ultimate truth is utterly beyond any linguistic and conceptual conventions. All con­ceptual cognitions, as Gorampa understands them, “can focus on only one of the four extreme views at a time, and therefore it is impossible to repu­diate the conceptual categories of the four extremes simultaneously.”352 Since the goal of enlightenment is to transcend the conceptual categories, the repudiation of the conceptual categories is absolutely essential. More-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH83over, conceptual cognitions are seen as multiplying the conceptual cate­gories rather than assisting the process of transcendence.Dreyfus writes that the Sakya tradition “insists that concepts apply only to conventional reality. Ultimate truth in Madhyamaka is completely beyond the reach of concepts. It is utterly ineffable, in the strong sense of the word.”353 Dreyfus also notes that “for the Sa-gya tradition in general and Go-ram-ba in particular, the key concept in Madhyamaka philosophy is not the absence of real existence, but freedom from elaborations (pra- pancay spros pa). Ultimate truth is utterly beyond the reach of elabora­tion.”354 On this matter, as on others, Gorampa exemplifies a more widely held view—one that is shared, notably by Shakya Chogden,355 Taktsang Lotsawa,356 Mipham Rinpoche,357 Gendiin Chopel,358 and Khenpo Kiin- zang Palden.359 Interestingly, however, some of his usual allies, such as Longchen Rabjam,360 Sakya Pandita,361 and Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen362 are more sympathetic to Tsongkhapas view on this account. Like Tsong­khapa, this latter group argues that logical inference paves the way to the direct realization of ultimate reality.Given the close link between the limits of language and that of the con­ceptual mind, Gorampa argues that, just as an enlightened person cannot coherently explain ultimate reality, an ordinary being cannot realize ulti­mate reality: “It is not possible to explain ultimate truth through definition, through defined object, or through any other means in the manner it is experienced during the meditative equipoise, which is free from any con­ceptual elaborations. This is because ultimate truth is inexpressible through language and is not an apprehended object of the mind.”363Tsongkhapa only partly agrees with Gorampa on this point. He agrees that an ordinary being could not have a direct nonconceptual realization of ultimate reality; but, unlike Gorampa, he holds that an ordinary being can form a useful conceptual realization of ultimate reality.An ordinary being does this, according to Tsongkhapa, by listening to dis­courses. While a conceptual understanding (an inferential knowledge) of ultimate reality is mistaken, since it assumes the universal of ultimate real­ity to be ultimate reality itself, it is nonetheless an essential prerequisite for the direct personal realization of ultimate truth. Here it is important to dis­tinguish between Tsongkhapas views on the universal of ultimate reality and ultimate reality perse, and so to distinguish between his views regarding the universal and the particular. The universal of ultimate reality is constructed through conceptual-linguistic conventions. Ultimate reality itself, however, is not a conceptual-linguistic construction. Thus, for example, the universal"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof ultimate truth pertaining to material form is constructed on the basis of linguistic descriptions and the conceptual grasping of emptiness of the material form, but the emptiness of the material form in itself is not con- structed on the basis of conceptual-linguistic conventions. So even though the universal of ultimate truth of material form is constructed on the basis of conceptual-linguistic conventions, the ultimate truth of material form is not entirely dependent on conceptual-linguistic conventions. The ontolog­ical character of emptiness retains its true identity despite the fact that var­ious universals, both coherent and incoherent, are imposed upon it.Confusion between the universal of ultimate truth and ultimate truth itself—the particular—is somewhat analogous to the confusion that may arise between a face and its reflection. Just as we may mistake a reflection for an actual face, conceptual cognition mistakes the universal of ultimate truth for ultimate truth itself. The confusion here arises partly because the conceptual mind does not have direct access to ultimate truth, but only to the universal of ultimate truth, which mediates between the conceptual mind and emptiness. We may say that it thereby blocks direct access to ulti­mate truth, but at the same time, it also enables indirect access. The con­ceptual mind mistakes inferential knowledge via a universal for direct knowledge, but that does not make inferential knowledge fruitless. As we have already noted, for Tsongkhapa, if inferential knowledge of ultimate truth is based on valid empirical premises rather than mere fictions or imag­inations, then inferential knowledge of ultimate truth provides the scaffold­ing that enables direct nonconceptual access to ultimate truth.Tsongkhapa maintains a clear-cut distinction between direct nonconcep­tual realization of ultimate truth and conceptual realization of such truth. According to him, Candraklrti s use of the cataract analogy indicates only “the listeners failure to realize exactly what is explained; it does not rule out [the listeners conceptual] realization of the nonexistence of hair.”364 By lis­tening to descriptions, a person with cataracts could inferentially grasp the nonexistence of hairs despite not having the capacity to see this directly. Similarly, when ultimate truth is explained linguistically, ordinary beings afflicted by deluded ignorance cannot form an understanding of it to the level of those who are enlightened. So long as a person remains afflicted by deluded ignorance, he sees essences where none exist. A person afflicted in this way can never directly realize ultimate truth merely by listening to explanations. Yet since ultimate truth is not entirely ineffable,363 and not entirely incomprehensible, explanations can lead to a conceptual view of ultimate reality. Tsongkhapa says:"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH85Although the explanation of ultimate truth through an analogy does not lead to its realization in the way [ultimate truth] is seen by those free from the affliction of the cloud of ignorance, this does not mean [Candraklrti] accepts reality as nonrealizable in a general sense. Ultimate truth is not ineffable, for definitive scrip­tural texts and their verbal descriptions do embody its profound meanings. Furthermore it is not the case that [ultimate truth] is unrealizable by the mind associating with [verbal descriptions]. Therefore every single statement explaining the meaning of real­ity as beyond the scope of consciousness and verbal description must be understood in the same light.366Tsongkhapa also argues for a significant role for language and conceptual mind in forming a bridge between conventional knowledge and ultimate knowledge. In this respect, an inferential understanding of ultimate truth is not only possible, but is, in fact, essential as a step on the path to the direct realization of ultimate truth. Conceptual realization, he argues, serves as the causal nexus between the naive cognitive states of an ordinary being and the evolved wisdom of an arya. Conceptual understanding of ultimate truth, no matter how trivial, acts as an epistemic bridge that transports us from the known—conventional truth— to the unknown— ultimate truth.Inasmuch as it must be based on valid empirical premises, inferential knowledge of ultimate truth is linked to the experience of ordinary beings. Inasmuch as it involves an understanding of ultimate reality on the level of reason, it is linked to the transcendent experience of an arya. In this way the conceptual realization of ultimate truth gradually paves the way for the most enlightened wisdom of buddhahood. Hence, for Tsongkhapa, the conceptual understanding of ultimate truth is absolutely required for the possibility of such enlightenment.For Gorampa the realization of ultimate truth is perfectly sui generis. It spontaneously arises when a person attains the state of aryahood. And the realization must have no prior causal link with the conceptual experience of the ordinary being. Since conceptual knowledge contributes nothing to the eventual realization of the nonconceptual ultimate reality, nothing whatsoever is required to bridge the gap between the conventional knowl­edge of an ordinary being and the ultimate knowledge of an arya. The tran­sition is thus seen as a leap or as a spontaneous unfolding rather than as a gradual progression.Another important point is that, for Gorampa, “the only nondeceptive"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"86THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEsubjective consciousness is the aryas meditative equipoise. That which is nondeceptive from this perspective amounts to ultimate truth.”367 There­fore nothing whatsoever is capable of realizing ultimate reality except the wisdom of meditative equipoise. What is the cause of meditative wisdom? Is there a causal link between the ordinary cognitive state and the cogni­tive state of an arya? For Gorampa, as pointed out earlier, the answer is simply no. An aryas wisdom in meditative equipoise arises without any traceable prior causal event, such as a deluded cognitive state of an ordi­nary being. Direct nonconceptual realization of ultimate truth arises from nowhere.Moreover Gorampa explicitly rejects the role of reasoning in realizing ultimate truth, arguing that valid reasoning consciousness belongs to the conventional realm and cannot bridge the two sides, even though a valid reasoning consciousness of ultimate truth is analogous to an aryas realiza­tion during meditative equipoise.368 Dreyfus also draws attention to this point: “When analyzing the way in which inference relates to emptiness, Go-ram-ba uses the concept of object universal.... Go-ram-bas point is that inference does not apprehend emptiness itself.... Emptiness lies beyond the grasp of thought and language, which has access only to the object universal of emptiness.”369 Dreyfus argues that such a view, although familiar within the Dharmaklrtian tradition, “has no obvious place in Madhyamaka, especially when understood from Candrakirtis perspec­tive.”370 Dreyfus also notes that “the notion of object universal seems to be tied down to the foundationalist standpoint of the epistemologists. Never­theless, Go-ram-ba is quite happy to use this notion to strengthen his analy­sis of emptiness as being beyond thought and language.”371So far as Gorampa is concerned, language and the conceptual mind have no soteriological value. Any knowledge founded on conventional truth, according to his view, is useful only within the conventional realm. Since, metaphysically speaking, ultimate truth stands beyond the conventional world, ultimate truth is completely inaccessible to the conventional con­structions of language and conceptual mind. A correct understanding of ultimate truth unfolds only with the total eradication of the empirical world, and the only way to understand ultimate reality is through noncon­ceptual immediacy.Tsongkhapas argument for the soteriological value of language and the conceptual mind is examined in more detail below in the discussion of the Indian Madhyamikas’ views on the limits of language and conceptuality."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH87Inejfability and Inconceivability of Ultimate TruthIn the Muhzmadhyamakakdrika, while analyzing the ineffability and incon­ceivability of ultimate reality, Nagarjuna writes:What is to be expressed has ceased For the domain of thought has ceased.Like nirvana, the ultimate reality Is nonarisen and nonceased.372In the Prasannapada Candraklrti glosses Nagarjunas statement:If there is something to be expressed here, indeed it should be explained. However, when what is to be expressed has ceased, and in the context where expressions do not have their referent objects, buddhas teach nothing whatsoever. Why is there no ref­erent to be expressed? Because as it says, “the domain of thought has ceased.” Domain of thought means “arena of conceptualiza­tion.” Domain (spyodyul) is an object (yul), meaning an appre­hended object (dmigs pa). If there were any domain of thought, one could argue that the superimposition of labels would make sense. As [ultimate reality] is not suitable to be a domain of thought, what could language possibly represent through logical projections?Why is there no domain of thought? Because, as it says, “like nirvana, ultimate reality is nonarisen and nonceased.” As the ultimate reality is nonarisen and nonceased, the nature of phe­nomena and the defining characteristics of phenomena are said to be equivalent to nirvana. Thought therefore does not engage with [ultimate reality]. Without thought, there are no grounds whatsoever for linguistic superimposition. Furthermore, with­out having [a domain to be engaged], what would language refer to? For this reason, the statement “buddhas taught nothing whatsoever” still stands.373Reflecting further on the same issue in the Madhyamakavatarabhasya, Can- drakirti says that “because it is ineffable, and because it is not an object of consciousness, [ultimate truth] cannot truly be explained.”374Let us now consider the two Tibetan readings of these statements from"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATENagarjuna and Candraklrti. Tsongkhapa emphasizes the distinction be­tween the standpoints of the ultimate and of the empirical. As far as he is concerned, any realization, whether of conventional or ultimate truth, as well as any explanation of either of the truths, is possible only from the empirical standpoint. The ultimate standpoint is the perspective of tran­scendent wisdom. When transcendent wisdom engages with the transcen­dent mode of things, it does so by penetrating and transcending all conceptual categories. The fact that both Nagarjuna and Candraklrti take ultimate reality to be an inexpressible (brjod par by a ba min pa) and nonen­gaged domain of thought (sems kyi spyodyul min pa) means, according to Tsongkhapa, that they both can be interpreted as speaking exclusively from the ultimate perspective. “If there is anything expressible from the ultimate standpoint,” Tsongkhapa says, “it should be expressed. From the ultimate standpoint, however, what is to be expressed has ceased, and thus it appears to be nonexistent.”375 Transcendent wisdom engages with the ultimate truth by dissolving all conceptual objects.376 Consequently no phenome­non, he argues, retains its discreteness, shape, color, taste, etc., when pene­trated by transcendent wisdom— by ultimate valid consciousness. All five aggregates are directly experienced by this wisdom as ultimately nonarisen and nonceased, not coming and not going, not permanent and not annihi­lated, peaceful and beyond thought constructions. This profound experi­ence itself amounts to experiencing nirvana.377 Tsongkhapa therefore sees no inconsistency in arguing that, from the perspective of the ultimate, “buddhas taught nothing whatsoever.”378Gorampa takes a very different view of the distinction between ultimate and empirical standpoints. For him the empirical standpoint refers strictly to the perspective of an ordinary being while the ultimate standpoint refers to an aryas wisdom of the meditative equipoise. Ultimate truth is always inexpressible and inconceivable, and for Gorampa, ultimate truth is iden­tical to the ultimate perspective— the transcendent consciousness of a bud- dha. They are one and the same. He argues that “eventually cognition itself becomes an undefiled cognitive sphere, and that itself is the ultimate bud- dha, who is adorned with the perfections of abandonment and realization,”379 and further that “ultimate reality, empirical reality, and subjective wisdom— all three lose their distinctness,” becoming one with transcendent conscious­ness.380 Tathagata is, he says, by definition a transcendent phenomenon, while conventionalities, are, by definition, mundane phenomena projected by ignorance.381 “Proliferation (spros pay prapanca) is a characteristic feature of causally effective things. The tathagata [i.e., ultimate truth], however, is"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH89not a thing, hence it is not a category of proliferation but is transcendent of proliferation.”382In Gorampas account, as in Jayanandas, conventional truths include everything except what is ultimate. “Conventional truth,” as the former puts it, “includes conceptual fabrications of phenomena, such as that of existence and nonexistence, by ordinary beings. Such [conceptually fabri­cated] natures are nonexistent, because existence, nonexistence, and so forth, are logically unacceptable.”383 As long as there is an existent, either a subject or an object, it cannot, according to Gorampa, be an ultimate truth. Subject and object, this and that, existence and nonexistence— all these dualities are categories of deluded thoughts, and ultimate truth transcends all dualities.Since ultimate truth is beyond language and thought, it cannot be an object of knowledge. If it were knowable in this way, according to Gorampa, “then it should be expressible by language. However, because [ultimate truth] is not a domain of thought, no linguistic expression what­soever can express it.”384 Ultimate reality is primordially nonarisen, non­ceased, and nondual, not only epistemologically, but also in a metaphysical sense. Therefore “mind with dualistic appearances cannot by any means apprehend the aspect [of nondual ultimate reality].”385 But why is an ulti­mate truth not a domain of mind? “Because nonarisen, nonceased, and nondual ultimate reality is itself the nature of phenomena. And since the nature of phenomena is posited as synonymous with nirvana, mind cannot engage it.”386 Gorampa continues: “Since mind does not engage [ultimate reality], there is no reason [ultimate reality] should be linguistically expressed. As [mental engagement] is nonexistent, no words can capture it. In this sense ‘buddhas taught nothing whatsoever.’”387 Words convey mean­ing only if those words have a point of reference. Where no point of refer­ence is verified by mind, there is simply no object to be expressed. The words are meaningless inasmuch as they have no affirmative message to convey. “If [ultimate truth] were at all expressible,” says Gorampa, “there would be no reason why it should not be explained. However, because ulti­mate reality is free from any of the obsessions of linguistic determinations (sgras bzhin pa), [buddhas] refused to teach anything at all.”388Although Gorampa unequivocally maintains that ultimate truth is be­yond the description of words and beyond the comprehension of thought, this claim does not prevent him from holding the view that buddhas do pro­visionally teach the doctrine of ultimate reality in conventional terms by employing what he describes as “linguistic superimposition” (sgro brtag,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"9 0THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEsamaropa).m As Pettit describes it, Gorampa grants only “propaedeutic function” to the conceptual and linguistic formulation of ultimate truth. “This follows logically from his assumption that conventional reality is per­vaded by conceptuality and that conceptuality is pervaded by ignorance.”390 Gorampa and most of his Tibetan counterparts—such as Mipham Rin- poche391 and Shakya Chogden392—are generally opposed to the distinction between ultimate and conventional standpoints as articulated by Tsong­khapa. In dealing with issues related to the ineffability and inconceivability of ultimate reality, they all treat this distinction as essentially metaphorical, and therefore maintain that ultimate truth is utterly ineffable and concep­tually unknowable. Modern interpreters such as Murti, Singh,393 and Narain also strongly endorse Gorampas line of argument here.394 Murti, for instance, argues that “the real is utterly devoid (sunya) of these and other conceptual constructions; it is transcendent to thought and can be realized only in nondual knowledge—prajnd or Intuition, which is the Absolute itself.”395 Harsha Narain argues that Nagarjunas “whole endeavour is to demonstrate beyond the shadow of doubt that his Sunya is totally transcen­dent to all possible categories of reason.”396If language is utterly incapable of disclosing ultimate truth, that raises another important question: What is the point of the Buddhas active teach­ing about ultimate truth, given the utter incapacity of words to express it, and the utter incapacity of the intellects of his disciples to grasp its mean­ing? Indeed, Gorampa himself fills several volumes with teachings about the ultimate truth. For Gorampa and his allies this is quite a formidable objec­tion and one that he never fully resolves. As Narain puts it:The Madhyamika finds it extremely difficult to give us even the remotest idea of the deliverance of the ultimate experience or of enlightenment called Prajndpdramitd and can do little better than to mutter that it is of the nature of silence (tusnim-bhdva), non-apprehension (anupalambha) and cessation of all expression (prapancopasama). It has no knowing whatsoever (yatra jndna- syapa a-prcdrah)^7However, by claiming that ultimate truth is conceptually unknowable, Gorampa does not mean to say that ultimate truth is thoroughly unknow­able. For him ultimate truth is knowable by means of nonconceptual wis­dom. In fact, no matter how much the two Tibetan Madhyamikas are divided in their views regarding the intelligibility of language and the limits"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"of conceptual mind, to the extent that they both accept ultimate reality as knowable by nonconceptual wisdom, they speak with a single voice. The details of nonconceptual knowledge will be discussed in the next chapter, but before we move on, we will briefly examine the validity of the concep­tual right view.The Validity of the Conceptual Right ViewThere are three issues crucial to the analysis of conceptual right view: (i) its defining characteristics; (2) its significance as the forerunner of the overall spiritual practices; and (3) its various types. Discussion of these will be fol­lowed by a more focused comparison of Tsongkhapas and Gorampas accounts.First, let us turn to the scriptures and look briefly at what they have to say on right view. In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, the Buddha offers the fol­lowing definition: “What is right view? Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering, and knowledge of the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering. This is right view”398 Although this definition of right view undoubtedly reflects the Buddhas practical and soteriological concerns, the emphasis here is on the correct knowledge of the four noble truths. The reason for this is that liberation requires correct knowledge of the four noble truths, and this in turn depends on the correct view of the nature of self.The nature of incorrect views is described in the Buddhas talk on “a thicket of wrong views” in the Sabbdsava Sutta:There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill per­son... does not discern what ideas are fit for attention, or what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention, and attends instead to ideas unfit for atten­tion. This is how he attends inappropriately: “Was I in the past?Was I not in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?” Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: “Am I?Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?”LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH 91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEAs he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him: The view “I have a self” arises in him as true and established, or the view “I have no self” .. .or the view “It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self” ., .or the view “It is precisely by means of self I perceive not-self”. ..or the view “It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self” arises in him as true and established. Or else he has a view like this:“This very self of mine—the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions— is the self of mind that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity.” This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering and stress.399For the Buddha, right view is understood in thoroughly practical terms— it leads us to produce skillful virtues. Our perspective on reality has a bear­ing well beyond mere theoretical conviction. Our views govern our attitudes, our actions, and our whole orientation toward life. Our views might not be explicity expressed or clearly systematized—we might have only a hazy sense of our belief systems—but, as Bhikkhu Bodhi puts it, “these views have a far-reaching influence. They structure our perceptions, order our values, crystallize into the ideational framework through which we interpret to ourselves the meaning of our being in the world.”400 Our actions of body, speech, and mind may create the fabric of our lives, but all our actions, along with the consequences that follow from them, derive from the views we hold. Thus right view is the crucial difference between continued delusion on the one hand and progress on the path on the other. Views are not mere hypotheses, they imply an ontological commitment— they are our judgment of what is real and what is false. Those commitments drive our behavior and in consequence our entire experience.The second issue to be discussed here concerns the role of right view as the forerunner of the entire Buddhist path, the guide for all the other fac­tors. In recognition of its importance, the Buddha places right view at the very beginning of the noble eightfold path. “Bhikkhus, just as the dawn is the forerunner and first indication of the rising of the sun, so is right view the forerunner and first indication of the wholesome state.”401 Right view"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH93enables the practitioner to understand his or her starting point, destination, and the successive landmarks as practice advances. To engage in practice without a foundation in the right view is to risk getting lost in futile activ­ities. It would be like driving somewhere you’ve never been without con­sulting a map or asking someone who has traveled there. You might get into the car and start to drive, but rather than approaching your destination, you are just as likely to move farther away from it. At the very least, you need some idea of the general direction and the roads that lead to it.Success in the remaining elements of the eightfold Buddhist path depends on the orientation provided by right view: “For one of right view, bhikkhus, right intention springs up. For one of right intention, right speech springs up... For one of right knowledge, right deliverance springs up.”402 The Buddha also characterizes right view as the forerunner in that it leads to freedom from the wrong view: “How is right view the forerun­ner? One discerns wrong view as wrong view, and right view as right view...One tries to abandon wrong view and to enter into right view.”403The third issue concerns the different types or aspects of right view. In its fullest measure, right view involves a correct understanding of all phe­nomena—both mental and material—and thus its scope is equal to the full range of phenomena. Right view can also be understood in a more restricted sense. For example, in the Sammaditthi Suttay Sariputra considers sixteen different aspects of right view that pertain to the efficacy of moral and immoral actions, the four nutriments of life,404 the four noble truths, the twelve factors of dependent arising,405 and the taints (asava) as the condi­tions for breeding ignorance. However, for practical purposes, all aspects of right view are broadly classified under a twofold division: conceptual right view and experiential right view.Conceptual right view, in technical terms, is lokika-samyagdrsti (’jig rten pa’iyang dagpa’i Ita ba), meaning “mundane right view.” This view is pri­marily concerned with a correct conceptual understanding of those empir­ical truths that operate entirely within the confines of the world. In most circumstances, conceptual right view is equivalent to the understanding of the natural laws governing the material and spiritual worlds, particularly the understanding of how and why it is essential to act in accordance with the law of karmic cause and effect to achieve liberation.Experiential right view is lokottara-samyakdrsti (jig rten las pa’i yang dag pa’i Ita ba), or “supramundane right view.” This right view is primarily con­cerned with an immediate understanding of truths within the confines of ones own psychophysical aggregates. Although it, too, operates entirely"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEwithin the confines of the mundane world, it penetrates, transcends, and directly reveals the supramundane nature within oneself.For both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa, conceptual right view consists of the intellectual grasp of principles enunciated in the Buddhas teaching. It is called right view because it conforms with the truths, although it does not fully disclose those truths. Conceptual right view consists of the correct conceptual understanding of the truths arrived at by listening and studying the Buddhas teaching, followed by deeper personal analysis of their mean­ings on a conceptual level.Experiential right view is the penetration of the truth enunciated in the Buddhas teachings within ones own immediate experience. For Tsong­khapa conceptual right view conforms to both ultimate and conventional truth, since the two truths are mutually interlocking. For Gorampa concep­tual right view conforms only to conventional truth and is inconsistent with ultimate truth. Just as the two truths are mutually contradictory and hier­archical, so the two types of right view are also mutually contradictory and hierarchical.As far as the scope and validity of conceptual right view are concerned, Tsongkhapa and Gorampa are clearly divided. For Tsongkhapa conceptual right view is critical to the development of experiential right view, whereas Gorampa regards conceptual right view to only refer to ordinary beings grasping conventional truths as truly existent—it is wholly invalid for developing experiential right view. Pettit in Miphams Beacon of Certainty makes the same point, “Gorampa understands conceptuality ipso facto as involving apprehension of true existence, whereas Tsongkhapa,” he argues, “does not.”406 These two opposing positions are not surprising; they are consistent with Tsongkhapas and Gorampas arguments above regarding the limits of language and of the conceptual mind.As we have seen, ultimate truth is for Tsongkhapa an object of concep­tual knowledge—to some degree it is both linguistically expressible and conceptually knowable. Consistent with that, he maintains that conceptual right view guides experiential right view, it acts as a forerunner to direct experience. In Bhikkhu Bodhi s words, “When.. .driven by keen aspiration to realize the truth embedded in the formulated principles of Dhamma, it [conceptual right view] serves as a critical phase in the development of wis­dom (panna)y for it provides the germ out of which experiential right view gradually evolves.”407 Experiential right view, for Tsongkhapa, is essentially generated by the practice of insightful meditation guided by a correct con­ceptual understanding of the truths. One must thus begin with a correct"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"conceptual grasp of the teachings in order to integrate the full scope of the Buddhadharma within ones immediate experience. By using a correct con­ceptual understanding and by cultivating the threefold training—morality, concentration, and wisdom—intellectual comprehension is eventually transformed into immediate perception.Given Gorampas commitment to ultimate truth as linguistically inex­pressible and conceptually unknowable, conceptual right view must, accord­ing to him, be irrelevant in the journey to experiential right view. Conceptual right view is, in his sense, valid only within the conventions of ordinary beings and can provide no scaffolding for the development of experiential right view. Experiential right view comes only with penetration into a higher ultimate truth. Conceptual right view is properly so-called only in the sense that it is “right” or consistent with the conceptual-linguistic conventions of ordinary beings.In Gorampas view, just as there is only one truth, there is only one right view—and that is the experiential right view. Conceptual right view has no validity when it comes to realizing ultimate truth. The conceptual under­standing of a table, for example, is a conceptual right view since it is accept­able within the conventions of ordinary beings. On the other hand, conceptually grasping the existence of a rabbit’s horn or a mirage is a wrong view, for it is unacceptable even within the conventions of ordinary beings. Once a person becomes an arya, his or her conceptual right view becomes obsolete. From an aryas perspective, everything in the world is a projection of ignorance, and hence any conceptual view is only an obstruction to achieving experiential right view.For Gorampa, experiential right view is “supramundane” in that it accesses that which is metaphysically higher. As a buddha accesses supra­mundane truth exclusively, only the supramundane right view applies. An arya, on the other hand, accesses both mundane and supramundane truths, yet still possesses only the supramundane right view. Since an arya realizes that the mundane truths are mere illusions and projections of ignorance, an arya will always perceive such truths as flawed and mistaken. For right view implies an ontological commitment, and as Gorampa argues, aryas and buddhas are committed to the ontological status of ultimate truth alone. Ordinary beings, in contrast, are committed to the ontological status of mundane truths, so the mundane right view is valid for them.Tsongkhapa maintains that conceptual right view, “though conceptual in nature, is closely connected with nonconceptual wisdom, since it serves as the causal condition for the arising of nonconceptual wisdom.”408 HeLANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH 95"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"9 6THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEargues that merely having a nonconceptual experience does not necessarily mean that it satisfies the criterion of nonconceptual wisdom—equivalent to experiential right view. For it to be valid nonconceptual experience, it must have the capacity to eradicate the reifying tendencies. Only then would it satisfy the criterion of nonconceptual wisdom. “Such nonconcep­tual wisdom,” according to Tsongkhapa, “must be preceded by critical analysis through conceptual wisdom.”409The causal relationship between conceptual and experiential right view, or between mundane and supramundane right view, is crucial to Tsong­khapas argument. In spite of the apparent discordance between the views at issue, Tsongkhapa claims there is nonetheless an inevitable causal relation between them. “Without this causal nexus,” he argues, “it would be impos­sible for an uncontaminated path to arise from the contaminated ones. Thus no ordinary person could ever become an arya.”410 There are infinite legitimate causal relationships that appear to be somewhat discordant but still are perfectly efficacious. Blue sprouts, for example, germinate from white seed, smoke arises from fire, man arises from woman, and so on.411 A similar causal relationship is at work, argues Tsongkhapa, between concep­tual and nonconceptual right view. “The aryas nonconceptual wisdom directly realizes person and phenomenon to be selfless and empty. In order to arouse the aryas nonconceptual wisdom realizing empty and selfless modes of person and phenomena, prior conceptual analysis of the identi­ties of person and phenomena is essential. Only through developing a sound conceptual understanding can one actualize its meaning by engag­ing in nonconceptual meditation.”412Therefore, from Tsongkhapas perspective, a person possessing right view can be any of the three kinds: ordinary person, arya, or buddha. An ordi­nary person initially has no experiential right view. Beginning with a con­ceptual right view, his or her practices eventually culminate in the initial penetration of the supramundane experience on reaching the path of see­ing (Tib. mthong lam, Skt. darsanamargd). The first phase of the direct cul­mination of the supramundane right view uproots all afflictive defilements, such as greed, aversion, and ignorance, transforming the person into an arya, allowing him or her to enter irreversibly upon the path to liberation. An arya has not only supramundane right view but also mundane right view. Following the path of seeing, an arya enters the path of meditation (Tib. bsgom lam, Skt. bhdvanamdrga) and uproots even the latent predispo­sitions of the earlier defilements. This leads to the attainment of arhathood—total personal liberation."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH97The path of meditation culminates with the attainment of perfect bud- dhahood— full enlightenment. This eradicates even the subtlest epistemic errors—the subtle misconception of dualistic appearances—conditioned by the earlier defilements. Unlike Gorampa, Tsongkhapa asserts that a bud- dha, like an arya, possesses both supramundane and mundane right views. In fact, at the level of buddhahood, conceptual and nonconceptual right views are mutually entailing. Hence a buddhas conceptual knowledge of phenomena as dependently arisen and nonconceptual knowledge of phe­nomena as empty are synonymous.Therefore the validity of conceptual right view and that of experiential right view, according to Tsongkhapa, are mutually reinforcing. The valid­ity of conceptual right view applies for all cognitive agents—ordinary beings, aryas, and buddhas—while experiential right view (conforming to ultimate truth) applies only to aryas and buddhas. An ordinary person has yet to achieve direct penetration of the supramundane path. Therefore, Tsongkhapa avers, the right view, conceptually grasped by the wise ordinary being and transformed into direct perception with the attainment of the path of seeing, reaches its consummation with the arrival of the final goal of the Buddhadharma— the attainment of complete buddhahood. Con­ceptual right view is thus the forerunner of all subsequent achievements.The Buddha himself explains that no single factor is as responsible for the arising of unwholesome states of mind as wrong view and no factor is as helpful for the arising of wholesome states of mind as right view; further­more, no single factor is as responsible for the suffering of living beings as wrong view and no factor so potent in promoting the good of living beings as right view.413 Therefore, in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s words, “though our concep­tual orientation toward the world might seem innocuous and inconsequen­tial, when looked at closely it reveals itself to be the decisive determinant of our whole course of future development.”414In other passages, the Buddha seems to warn against the grasping of views altogether, and Nagarjuna pays respect to the Buddha by endorsing this point: “I pay homage to Gautama who, out of compassionate mind, has taught the noble Dharma in order to relinquish all views.”415 On the surface this seems to support the position of Gorampa, who denies the capacity of any linguistic formulation to represent the ultimate view. A con­ceptual view, he would argue, can only obstruct us from the ultimate, and so we should discard it. Tsongkhapa, however, interprets Nagarjunas pas­sage to mean that we should avoid the metaphysical commitments of both essentialism and nihilism.416 For when the Buddha rejects views— as he"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"98THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEdoes in the Brahmajala Sutta (DN i), for instance—he does so on the basis that they involve a metaphysical commitment to either the existence of essences or complete nonexistence. Tsongkhapa would argue that Gorampas view is a commitment to nihilism, since it denies any validity whatsoever to conventional appeatances. In Tsongkhapas view, this goes too far. Let’s examine this final point a little more closely.Final ImplicationsTsongkhapa and Gorampa arrive at radically different conclusions concern­ing the Buddhas and Nagarjuna’s positions on the limits of language and the validity of conceptual right view. Tsongkhapa infers that the Buddha and Nagarjuna reject only metaphysical views—to be precise, wrong views—underpinned by an assumption of essence. Garfield adopts a simi­lar stance: “[The Gelugpas] simply argue that when Nagarjuna speaks of relinquishing ‘all views,’ he means ‘all false views,’ or ‘all views according to which things are inherently existent.’”417 Therefore Tsongkhapa argues that the Prasangika Madhyamikas have positions based on right views, and so they do indeed have views to be considered. Garfield, for instance, suggests an example of one such view that Tsongkhapa would not relinquish: “Emptiness, for madhyamika, is an ultimate truth. One can achieve a cor­rect view—a view of things as they in fact are. Such as this view surely should not be relinquished, for this would be to relinquish the soteriologi­cal goal of all Buddhist practice.”418 Garfield points out that, therefore, “the dGe-lugs pas argue, one must read Nagarjuna as suggesting straightfor­wardly, rationally, and without even a hint of paradox, that one should relinquish all false views, and that for the one who views emptiness as inher­ently existent there is no hope.”419Gorampa, again, concludes that the Buddha and Nagarjuna categori­cally reject all views. Any view formulated on empirically given truths, Gorampa claims, is always underpinned by the assumption of essence. He argues that, from the Prasangika Madhyamaka perspective, any so-called correct understanding of empirically given truths amounts to a metaphys­ical view—it constitutes either the extreme view of existence or the extreme view of nonexistence.420 Since the Prasangika Madhyamikas do not, strictly speaking, have any views to be presented,421 Gorampa maintains that “the Madhyamikas do not have any position whatsoever.”422 Accordingly, apart from refuting the views presented by the non-Madhyamaka philosophers"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"LANGUAGE, CONCEPTS, AND ULTIMATE TRUTH99through reductio ad absurduniy the Madhyamikas themselves take no affirmative position whatsoever.423 Moreover, from Gorampas standpoint, what is true for the Prasangika Madhyamikas is something other than what is empirically given to sense experience, which is true and real only for ordinary beings. Therefore only ordinary beings adhere to views based on the understanding of empirical truths and thus they alone have views to be presented.Tsongkhapa dismisses the assumption that the Buddha avoided pro­pounding any view whatsoever. On Tsongkhapas account, the Buddhas emphatic distinctions between right view and wrong view, coupled with his treatment of right view as the forerunner of all beneficial practices and of wrong view as the source of all problems, is sufficient to prove that the Bud­dha did not seek to relinquish all views indiscriminately. The criterion of right view is the correct conceptual understanding or immediate experience of empirically given truths. This holds true even for the Prasangika Madhyamikas who, Tsongkhapa proposes, have views of their own and therefore certainly have views to be presented to their critics—such as Bud­dhist realists.Another crucial distinction should be noted as well. For Tsongkhapa the transition from the ordinary state to buddhahood is smooth and gradual, an evolving chains of events—past practices generating present effects and present and past practices generating future effects. This is a gradual pro­gression and enhancement of the conceptual right view of an ordinary being founded on the ordinary sense perception of the law of imperma­nence— the arising and cessation of the phenomenal world. This sense per­ception is not exclusive to aryas or buddhas. “The perception of arising and ceasing of phenomena conditioned by various factors,” as Kalupahana puts it, “is available even to ordinary people who have not been able to completely free themselves from prejudices. Thus, there is a common denominator between the perceptions of an ordinary person and thbse of the enlightened one.”424Tsongkhapa therefore argues that all kinds of higher forms of knowledge, including the conceptual and experiential right view of the most enlight­ened person, have the conceptual right view of the ordinary state as their foundation. This is because wisdom, free from the conception of essence, depends on the conceptual understanding of the nonexistence of essence. Such understanding in turn develops from the correct conceptual analy­sis.423 What makes the difference, however, is the fact that the perceptions, or the sense experiences of the ordinary person, are colored by defilements,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"IOOTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEwhereas those of an enlightened being are totally free from such defilements and their latent dispositions.Gorampa, unlike Tsongkhapa, views the transition from the ordinary state to buddhahood as thoroughly discontinuous and abrupt. The sensory experience of empirically given truths, including the arising and cessation of the phenomenal world, are mutually contradictory with the wisdom of an enlightened person. All empirical experiences, both perceptual and con­ceptual, are deluded. They simply cannot be causal conditions for enlight­enment. There is thus no common denominator between the perceptions of an ordinary person and an enlightened one.How then could an ordinary person elevate him- or herself to the enlight­ened state? It appears to involve, at least for Gorampa, a metaphysical leap from the conditioned world of empirical truths to an unconditioned world of nirvana. Narain points out the inherent problem in such a view: “If all views are abolished, what remains? The truth, whatever it be like—truth, the apology for truth, the substitute for truth—is believed to transcend all speech and thought, to totally elude the grasp of reason, to be wholly incommunicable.”426 Narain also questions whether the truth could be as discontinuous with human reason as Gorampa would have it, and he adds: “If the answer is in the affirmative, Samsara and Nirvana turn out to be two different orders not only totally discontinuous and non-interactive but also impenetrably autonomous, thereby reducing the Madhyamika to the sta­tus of an uncompromising dualist.”427ConclusionIn this chapter, we have seen that, insofar as the limits of language and con­ceptual mind are concerned, the two Tibetan Prasangikas have little com­mon ground. By arguing that language can partly express ultimate truth, albeit not entirely, and that the conceptual mind has some degree of access to ultimate truth, although not fully, Tsongkhapa is able to postulate that ultimate truth can be an object of knowledge even with respect to the con­ceptual mind, thus allowing him to argue for the validity of conceptual right view. Gorampa, by arguing that language is wholly incapable of expressing ultimate truth and that the conceptual mind is equally incapable of knowing ultimate truth, advances the view that ultimate truth cannot possibly be an object of knowledge with respect to the conceptual mind, leading him to reject the validity of conceptual right view."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"4. Realizing Ultimate TruthIntroductionTs o n g k h a p a and Gorampa are united in claiming that ultimate truth is an object of knowledge, at least inasmuch as it is accessible to nonconceptual wisdom. Not only they but all Tibetan Prasangika Madhyamikas428 are unanimous on this point. But Tsongkhapa and Gorampa diverge on how ultimate truth can be realized by nonconcep­tual wisdom. In this chapter, we will consider the issues in relation to three different epistemological approaches:• seeing ultimate truth by way of not seeing it;• seeing ultimate truth by transcending conceptual elaborations; and• seeing ultimate truth nondually.Although the emphasis is slightly different in each approach, they neverthe­less all represent epistemic pathways geared toward the same nonconcep­tual realization of ultimate truth.Since the aim of this chapter is to provide a comparative analysis of Tsongkhapas and Gorampas epistemological models, we will not, except in certain relevant respects, deal with their ontological positions. However, one question is worth asking in this regard: What motivates Tsongkhapa and Gorampa to adopt the radically opposing epistemological viewpoints we are about to explore? One possible answer can be found in their disagree­ment regarding the scope and nature of the objects of negation (dgag bya ngos dzin). As we saw in the second chapter, for Tsongkhapa, what obstructs our attaining transcendent knowledge is the defilements—craving, aver­sion, and delusion—and the essences we project onto things. Superimposed essences, which are driven by the defilements, are thus considered the objects of negation. Gorampa agrees with Tsongkhapa inasmuch as he rec­ognizes the reifying tendencies of craving, aversion, and delusion as objects101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"102THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof negation, but he disagrees so far as the scope and nature of reified essence is concerned. While Tsongkhapa sees essence as a purely conceptual con­struction— as an empirically nonexistent and abstract entity that is pro­jected and imposed upon conventional truth from within—Gorampa equates essence with conventional truth. Thus he views not merely essence but both essence and conventional truth as purely conceptual constructions projected from within due to the power of ignorance.Tsongkhapa argues for eradicating both the underlying reifying tenden­cies—the defilements—and the conceptually reified essence. Gorampa argues for eradicating not only the underlying reifying tendencies, but also the entire matrix of the conventional world. This disagreement about the scope of the objects of negation, as we will see, informs their disagreements on epistemology and soteriology.Unlike the more analytic language employed elsewhere, I favor a more descriptive style in some sections of this chapter. Given the nature of the topic—meditative experiences and their philosophical implications—a purely analytical approach is often inadequate to convey many of the cru­cial issues. Modern scholars working on Madhyamaka philosophy tend to set aside anything related to meditative experiences. In my view, such an approach does a serious injustice to the epistemological systems of the Madhyamikas in general, and Tsongkhapa and Gorampa in particular. Since Tsongkhapas and Gorampas rather distinct epistemological models arise directly out of their different interpretations of the implications of cer­tain meditative experiences, both descriptive and analytical styles are needed for any useful comparison.Seeing Ultimate Truth by Way of Not Seeing ItIf you claim you see the Buddha,You see no Buddha at all.See the Buddha as you see the unseeable;See him like the trace of a bird flying in the sky.429In the Madhyamakavatarabhdsya Candraklrti explains the role of personal experience in realizing ultimate truth: “Only through exclusive personal experiences (ranggi myong ba nyid du) does the true nature [of ultimate real­ity] become clearer to those enthusiastic listeners,” he writes.430 And in the Prasannapada he says:"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH103Because [ultimate reality] is not realized through another it is called an unrealizable through another. This means that it is not realized through another’s explanation. Instead the meaning is that it is to be realized personally (rang nyid).AJ>x... One realizes ultimate reality personally by way of not realizing it. True nature pertaining to things is thus not realized through anyone else, and that itself is ultimate reality.432The way in which ultimate truth is realized, or seen, by way of not seeing it is explained by Candraklrti in the Madhyamakdvatarabhasya:[Question]: Is it not true that [ultimate reality] is not seen with characteristic of such [dualistic] appearance? So how do they [i.e., aryas] see it? [Reply]: Yes, it is true that [ultimate reality is not seen with dualistic appearances]. Yet [the Prasangika Madhyamikas] assert that they see it by way of not seeing.433Since “seeing it by way of not seeing” is a description of both the cognitive state of a meditator engaged in the meditation on ultimate truth and the meditative process itself, it is essential to understand both the process and the state arrived at. Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree that, while noticing the bodily and mental processes as they arise and cease, a meditator also discerns the arising and passing away of the aggregates. When knowledge of the momentary and fleeting nature of aggregates becomes mature, keen, and strong, the initially discontinuous awareness of arising and cessation unfolds continuously. When keen knowledge thus proceeds and intensifies, then neither the arising of each bodily and mental process, nor its middle phase known as presence, nor the continuity of bodily and mental processes, nor the occurrence of unbroken flux is apparent to the meditator. Nor are the shape of the hand, the foot, the face, the body, and so on apparent to him. At this point, the meditator has entered single-pointed concentration on the ultimate truth. What is apparent to the meditator is only the ceasing of physical and mental processes, called vanishingot dissolution.434 In the med­itative state, all objects of meditation— bodily as well as mental—seem to the meditator to be entirely absent, to have become nonexistent. It appears to the meditator as if what is seen has vanished. Initially the meditator’s consciousness takes familiar delight in conceptual elaborations, for instance, of shapes, concepts of individual identity derived from the continuity of serial phenomena, and collective concepts derived from the agglomeration"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"1 0 4THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof phenomena. Even up to the knowledge of arising and cessation, the med­itator fastens on to structures or features— such as any mark, sign, idea, or image—of objects conceived or perceived. All graspable conceptual objects remain apparent to the meditators senses. But once the knowledge of ulti­mate truth, or emptiness, is achieved as described above, no such concep­tual formations or structures appear to consciousness.435 Since, at this point, cognition does not involve any graspable object but is nonetheless engaged, albeit with an empty cognitive sphere, so the process is fittingly described as “seeing by way of not seeing.”Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree with the account thus far. Before em­barking on an examination of Tsongkhapas view, we need to address a key issue that forms the backdrop to his interpretation of Candraklrti. Tsong­khapa makes a crucial distinction between conceptual wisdom— otherwise known as empirically valid cognition or empirical wisdom—and nonconcep­tual wisdom—otherwise known as ultimately valid cognition or ultimate wisdom. The former, as Tsongkhapa characterizes it, cognizes things that are presented to it without analyzing their ultimate mode of being, while the latter cognizes the ultimate nature of things by way of such a critical analy­sis. Despite distinguishing between these two valid cognitions, he main­tains that they are mutually entailing. Whether the subjective consciousness is that of a buddha, another arya, or even an ordinary being, these distinc­tions and the mutually supportive relation between them remain epistem- ically important.Against this background, Tsongkhapa explains the position taken by Candraklrti as follows:Yes, it is true that [the nonconceptual wisdom] does not see [ulti­mate reality] by way of [seeing] dualistic appearances, because dualistic appearances do not withstand the critical perspective of the [wisdom] realizing things as they truly are. However, [the Prasangika Madhyamikas] assert that aryas see [ultimate truth] by way of not seeing.436The key issues raised in Candraklrtis passages concern how, and in what ways, ultimate truth is realized. As a result, the distinction between the two cognitive faculties, and the way ultimate and conventional truth relate to them, is of central importance. Tsongkhapa insists that ultimate truth is the object of nonconceptual wisdom. He argues that from the vantage point of nonconceptual wisdom, all dualistic appearances of conventional"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH105truths disappear. Such wisdom sees phenomena as having no discrete identities, no positive or affirmative qualifications whatsoever. All pheno­mena present themselves to such wisdom initially as in flux, as insubstan­tial, and, eventually, as selfless and empty. The empty mode of phenomena is seen by nonconceptual wisdom through the penetration of all dualistic appearances.Tsongkhapa argues, in fact, that a direct realization of the empty mode of phenomena is possible only by piercing through all conventional truths by ultimate wisdom. Hence “the mode of realizing realities as they truly are is byway of not seeing the appearances of conventionalities, such as the psy­chophysical aggregates.”437 In other words, ultimate wisdom realizes ulti­mate truth by directly perceiving the ultimate characteristics of phenomena (i.e., their empty mode) without actually perceiving the characterized phe­nomena as such.438 This means that the ultimate truth of phenomena, such as the psychophysical aggregates, is indeed seen by way of not seeing those phenomena.Let us now turn to Gorampa, for whom the distinction between concep­tual and nonconceptual wisdom has significance only in the case of an unenlightened aryas mode of cognition. He considers such an arya, one who is still in training, as the sole cognitive agent who conceives both con­ventional and ultimate truth. For buddhas and ordinary beings, the distinc­tion between conceptual and nonconceptual wisdom has no relevance or application. A buddha cognizes ultimate truth exclusively, and thus requires only nonconceptual or ultimate wisdom. An ordinary being, however, has no access to ultimate truth, and thus does not require nonconceptual or ultimate wisdom. Conceptual or empirical wisdom serves as the sole epis- temic resource for ordinary beings.What is at issue here is not just a matter of distinguishing between the consciousnesses of an arya and a buddha, but also the role of ultimate wis­dom as shared by the two. Gorampa maintains that, from the vantage point of nonconceptual wisdom, all conventionalities disappear. Ultimate wis­dom, he argues, “does not apprehend even the slightest dualistic appearance [both in the conventional and the ultimate sense], for it is thoroughly free from all epistemic misconceptions, including predisposition without any trace.”439When it comes to the question of how ultimate reality is realized, at least insofar as it can be described in words, Tsongkhapa and Gorampa thus seem quite close. Like Tsongkhapa, Gorampa argues that ultimate truth is real­ized by way of not seeing it—namely, by way of dissolving all dualistic"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"io 6THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEappearances of conventionalities or by abjuring any positive account of ulti­mate truth. Both hold that conventional truth is always realized by way of engaging with dualistic appearances, while ultimate truth is realized byway of dissolving all dualistic appearances. Yet whereas Tsongkhapa posits the mutually supportive relation between conceptual and nonconceptual wis­dom, even in the realization of ultimate truth, Gorampa maintains that nonconceptual wisdom alone is capable of such realization. In fact, he claims the exact opposite of Tsongkhapa: Gorampa argues that nonconcep­tual wisdom—ultimate wisdom—can have no empirical grounding, and in gaining access to ultimate truth, it must operate entirely without reliance on empirical input.Tsongkhapas and Gorampas divergence on the status of empirical wis­dom stems from their disagreement about the efficacy of conventional truth, which in turn is informed by their dissension on the nature and extent of the objects of negation, and thence by their fundamental discord on the relationship between the two truths. Tsongkhapa argues for unity between the two truths and thus does not consider conventional truths as objects of negation. Gorampa insists on disunity between the two truths and does consider conventional truths as objects of negation. Similarly Tsongkhapa argues for unity between the two cognitive faculties, so that even a buddha is said to be equipped with both empirical and ultimate wis­dom. Gorampa argues for disunity between the two cognitive faculties, so that a buddha is said to have only ultimate or nonconceptual wisdom.How exactly does a similar understanding of the nature of nonconcep­tual wisdom—seeing by not seeing—lead to such different conclusions? The answer lies in how they parse this expression. Tsongkhapa reads the phrase “seeing by way of not seeing5 as the same idea expressed in the claim: “without seeing constitutes the noble seeing.”440 The phrase “seeing by way of not seeing” is not contradictory, for in Tsongkhapas view, the Prasangikas “do not accept seeing nothing as seeing [the ultimate reality].”441 For Tsong­khapa the terms seeing and not seeing, used within the same phrase, imply two different objects of reference, and for this reason, he argues, “not seeing conceptual elaborations is itself posited as seeing the transcendence of con­ceptual categories.”442 The term seeingY&s “transcendence of the conceptual elaborations” (spros dral, aprapanca) as its referent, while the term not seeing has “conceptual categories” (spros pa, prapanca) as its referent. In other words, that which is seen is the empty mode of being of phenomena, while that which is not seen is the conventional mode of existence of those phe­nomena. Since the phrases “seen” and “not seen” take different objects, the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH107phrase need not be contradictory (or mystically paradoxical). It appropri­ately describes how ultimate truth appears to its cognizing consciousness.In some sense, Gorampa agrees with this latter point.443 Although he does not elaborate much on the phrase, he also understands the terms see- //z^and not seeing to take different referents. Seeing refers to ultimate real­ity, or the transcendence of conceptual categories, while not seeing refers to empirical reality, or conceptual categories.How then does Gorampa differ from Tsongkhapa in understanding the phrase “seeing it by way of not seeing”? Does seeing the ultimate by way of not seeing it constitute an engagement with a particular cognitive content, or is it simply the engagement with a total absencP.TranscendenceSince seeing ultimate truth by way of not seeing also means transcending conceptual elaboration, the distinctions between Tsongkhapas and Gorampas positions on realization of ultimate truth can be further articu­lated by considering the criterion that determines the transcendence of con­ceptual elaboration. A key issue here is whether the transcendence of conceptual elaboration calls for a total obliteration of conceptual categories. Is there a way of transcending conceptual elaborations without actually eliminating them?Proliferation of Conceptual ElaborationFirst let us look more closely at what is meant by conceptual elaboration, itself only a rough translation of the Sanskrit term prapanca (Pali papanca, Tib. sprospa).444 A precise English equivalent for the term presents difficul­ties. This is partly because the concept expressed by the term prapanca is totally foreign to the English-speaking world and partly because none of the texts in the Buddhist canon offers a clear and precise definition. However, the Buddhist canon does give a clear analysis of how prapanca arises in us, how it leads to conflict within and without, and how it can be ended.445Despite variation in some details, the texts all depict the essential basis that gives rise to prapancas. Although part of a larger causal nexus, the unskillful mental habit called prapanca lies at the heart of all conflicts— both within and without. Prapanca is essentially the blind tendency of thoughts to proliferate due to a mistaken sense of self. Prapanca distorts the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"io 8THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEnormal processes of cognition because of a fundamental error. Conse­quently phenomena present themselves to consciousness in a way they don’t actually exist— they appear as substantial, self-subsistent, isolated units with an immutable essence.Prapanca is felt most immediately on the experiential level—that is, the domain of the psychophysical aggregates. This domain is putatively divided into two—a cognitive or subjective element comprised of consciousness and its adjuncts, and a cognized or objective element comprised of cogni­tive data. Although the subjective and objective elements are interlocking and mutually dependent, the operation of prapanca leads to the conceptual bifurcation of those elements into subject and object. Just as the subject is split off from experience, and is erroneously conceived as distinct from the cognitive act itself, so also the objective element, conceived as the external world of objects, is equally divorced from cognitive experience. This error leads consciousness to view itself as an immutable ego standing against the world of changing phenomena—it solidifies the idea of the self as substan­tial and independently existing. Thanissaro Bhikkhu thus suggests “that the root of the categories of papanca is the perception, I am a thinker.”446Once the ego is solidified through the processes of prapanca, it con­stantly seeks self-affirmation and self-aggrandizement. Yet because the ego is an utter illusion, utterly empty, utterly void, so the appearance of self­hood itself generates a nagging sense of insufficiency—the ego cannot be adequate to that which it projects itself as being. Consequently, on both emotional and intellectual fronts, the ego experiences an aching sense of incompleteness, an inner lack requiring perpetual fulfillment, and the lurking suspicion of an ultimate lack of identity. The result is an inner dis­quietude and a chronic anxiety that is expressed in a compulsion to build and to fortify the sense of self. This process leads to greed, to desire, to relentless craving—for pleasure, wealth, power, and fame—all as a means to satisfy the need for self-security. In turn, this results in hatred, selfishness, and violence. Thus, through the process of prapanca, the agent becomes a victim of his own ignorance and misconception.447When the sense of self arises in relation to experiences, then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact, some feelings will naturally seem appealing and others will seem unappealing. “From this there grows desire, which comes into conflict with desires of others who are also engaging in papanca. This is how inner complications breed external contention.”448This analysis of prapanca and the way it victimizes the agent is funda­mental to the Buddhist phenomenology of suffering and therefore largely"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH109accepted by both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. Where they part company is regarding the scope of prapanca and how it is brought to an end. Tsong­khapa holds that prapanca is a reifying cognitive process that originates in habitual clinging to the substantiality and essences of things:[Question]: Ending what leads to the end of defilements?[Response]: Reproductive karma, which causes birth in samsara, arises from defilements. Although defilements in themselves are not self-evidently existent, they arise from the erroneous concep­tions engaging with the false notions such as “appealing” and “not appealing.” Erroneous conceptions engaging with the false notions, in turn, arise from the beginningless habituation with grasping at true existence in relation to the diverse categories of prapanca. These include cognitions and cognized objects, ex­pressions and expressed, jars and mattresses, male and female, gain and loss, and so forth. Prapanca, which grasps at the true existence of these things, can be eradicated through practice directed toward seeing the emptiness of those things.449Ultimate wisdom is the only means by which the cognitive distortions per­petuated by prapanca can be eradicated, and so Tsongkhapa and Gorampa both approach the categories of prapanca from the vantage point of this wis­dom rather than from a more generalized perspective. Consequently, in the context of ultimate wisdom, Tsongkhapa takes prapanca to mean not only the categories that are conceptually reified through the assumption of the existence of essences (those that are generally classified as the objects of negation), but also “the categories of appearances.”450 Gorampa follows suit, asserting that “far from being only truly existent entities or negative entities, prapanca includes all signs of phenomena, both positive and nega­tive, that provoke mental engagements and distractions.”451 As Dreyfus puts it: “By elaboration [prapanca]y Gorampa means more than holding to things as really existing or understanding emptiness to imply a commit­ment to a positive entity. He means all signs, positive or negative, through which objects can be conceptualized.”452As we have seen now on several occasions, an initial agreement between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa is often underlaid by a deeper discord. The same is true for their characterizations of prapanca. Tsongkhapa offers two context-dependent characterizations. One emphasizes an epistemic process—the mental tendency to essentialize that leads to the proliferation"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"n oTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof the categories of prapanca; the other emphasizes something more onto­logical— the contents of categories of prapanca as viewed by transcendent wisdom. Gorampa offers only a single characterization of prapanca, which places the emphasis solely on its contents. The characterization of prapanca as an epistemic process allows Tsongkhapa to argue that conventional phe­nomena are not the objects of negation, while Gorampas ontological approach, looking only at the ultimate nature of categories and contents, allows him to argue that the objects of negation comprise all conventional phenomena.Transcending Conceptual Elaboration[Manjus'ri said]: Subhuti, the five aggregates belong to causes and conditions. If they belong to causes and conditions, they do not belong to oneself or others. If they do not belong to self and oth­ers, they have no owner. If they have no owner, there is no one who grasps them. If there is no grasping, there is no contention, and noncontention is the practice of religious devotees. Just as a hand moving in empty space touches no object and meets no obstacles, so the bodhisattvas who practice the equality of empti­ness transcend the mundane world.453The contention between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa on the understanding of prapanca becomes clearer as we enter the second phase of the analysis, namely, that of the transcendence of prapanca. As we noted above, when Tsongkhapa approaches prapanca from the perspective of ultimate wisdom, he classifies all conventional appearances within the categories of prapanca. In his view, however, the transcendence of the categories of prapanca can­not be equated with “the absence of the prapanca of appearances.”454 Instead he holds that “transcendence of the categories of prapanca should be understood as a dissolution of all dualistic appearances from the stand­point of the direct perception of things as they really are.”455Although it is not entirely without ontological implications, Tsongkhapa does not view the transcendence of the categories of prapanca as a meta­physical transcendence. What is transcended is the conventional under­standing associated with the dualistic appearance of things—but without entailing the nonexistence of those things. This follows from his prior com­mitment to a transcendent epistemological perspective as the basis on which the essenceless, relational, and contingent nature of phenomena is"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTHIIIestablished. So while the cognitive agent experiences a total transcendence of the categories of prapanca in the realization of ultimate truth during meditative equipoise, Tsongkhapa takes this experience of transcendence to operate strictly within the epistemic domain—within the psychophysical aggregates, which are not themselves transcended or dissolved. Transcend- ing the categories of prapanca is not metaphysical transcendence.The characterization of prapanca offered by Gorampa, however, has strong metaphysical implications. “Prapanca,” he says, “is the characteristic feature of causally effective things. The tathagata, however, is not a thing, hence the categories of prapanca do not apply to it. Therefore the tathagata is transcendent of prapanca.”456 Gorampa makes it very clear that just as he does not regard prapanca as merely a cognitive process, neither is the tran­scendence of prapanca merely epistemic—it is not simply a change in one’s perspective. Prapanca is constitutive of all causally effective phenomena, and so the transcendence of the categories of prapanca means the transcen­dence of ^//empirical phenomena, including the empirical consciousness— as they are all causally effective. Thus the transcendence of prapanca is a transcendence of the very structures that constitute cognition, and so, one might say, even of cognition itself (or at least as it is part of the system of conventional appearances).Like Gorampa, many of his traditional allies— Rendawa,457 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen,458 Shakya Chogden,459 Karmapa Mikyo Dorje,460 Mipham Rinpoche,461 and Gendiin Chopel462—also treat prapanca as sim­ply synonymous with the system of conventional truth. This camp equates prapancas with the entire system of conventionalities and the latter with ignorance and the effects of ignorance. Thus they all maintain, like Gorampa, that prapancas, such as the impressions of existence and nonex­istence, appear as long as metaphysical transcendence is not achieved.463There is no doubt that Tsongkhapa and Gorampa differ markedly in their understanding of what the transcendence of the categories of prapanca entails. For Gorampa it is contradictory to hold that one can retain any con­nections with the conventional world while transcending the categories of prapanca—any relation with the conventional world is seen as detrimental to the pursuit of liberation. The transcendence of the categories of prapanca means, therefore, the total ontological and epistemological separation from the conventional world.464 Given Gorampas insistence on the primacy of ultimate truth and ultimate wisdom over conventional truth and empirical wisdom, his insistence on the need for metaphysical transcendence is hardly surprising—it is consistent with his overall agenda."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEIn contrast, Tsongkhapas philosophy is not committed to maintaining the primacy of ultimate truth and ultimate wisdom over conventional truth and empirical wisdom—the two truths and their cognitive counterparts are seen as interdependent and mutually entailing, and this holds true even in the case of transcendent epistemology. In Tsongkhapas view, the mutual interconnection of the two truths and the coordination between the two cognitions is not severed even in transcending of the categories of prapanca. “Because the characteristic of reality and the prapanca of the characterized appearances are mutually inseparable, the existence of ultimate truth would be impossible [without the characterized objects as its basis],” he con­tends.465 His insistence on the epistemic rather than metaphysical charac­ter of the transcendence at issue is thus clearly consistent with his emphasis on the unity between the two truths.While the consistency of their respective positions may be evident, it nev­ertheless remains for us to account more fully for the radically different accounts of transcendence adopted by Tsongkhapa and Gorampa. The issues come into sharpest relief when we consider the prapancas of personal identity—the five psychophysical aggregates. In Gorampas epistemology, the transcendence of the categories of prapanca requires a total elimination of all five psychophysical aggregates, since these are identified with the cat­egories of prapanca. The transcendent wisdom that is arrived at through such transcendence is ontologically independent of the conventionalities of the five psychophysical aggregates, and occurs only after every connection with conventional knowledge has been severed. The dissolution of those aggregates is therefore a necessary condition for the achievement of tran­scendent wisdom and does not undermine it. In Tsongkhapas epistemol­ogy, the transcendence of the prapancas of personal identity must be achieved within the five psychophysical aggregates. The transcendence of the prapancas of personal identity is soteriologically significant only if per­sonally experienced within the bound of ones psychophysical aggregates. Such transcendence must, therefore, be epistemic and psychological; it can­not entail complete metaphysical transcendence of conventionalities, or their total dissolution.As espoused by Tsongkhapa, ultimate valid cognition is transcendent wis­dom in the sense that it is directed to the transcendent sphere—toward ulti­mate truth, supramundane or unconditioned nirvana—but it is nevertheless mundane in terms of its scope and nature. Transcendent wisdom still oper­ates entirely within the range of the conditioned world— it is itself depend­ently arisen and does not imply a shift to a metaphysically unconditioned"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH113sphere. Only reality as it is given within their own five aggregates is acces­sible to yogis and knowable directly through their personal experience. The transcendence of the categories of prapancas is directed toward just such direct, personal wisdom. It is this wisdom, according to Tsongkhapa, that liberates beings from the obsession with conceptual elaborations such as those associated with the notions of an independent and substantial self— me and mine.The true and essential characteristic of transcendent knowledge thus consists in a precise understanding of the conditioned world itself. In Bhikkhu Bodhis words: “Though the realization of the unconditioned requires a turning away from the conditioned, it must be emphasized that this realization is achieved precisely through the understanding of the con­ditioned.”466 Whereas Gorampa argues that a practitioner must break off all ties with the conditioned world in order to attain unconditioned nirvana, Tsongkhapa claims that the practitioner must view things as they are by means of direct awareness. This idea is again nicely captured by Bhikkhu Bodhi: “Nibbana cannot be reached by backing off from a direct confrontation with samsara to lose oneself in a blissful oblivion of the world.”467 Emphasizing the same point, Nagarjuna also claims that “samsara and nirvana are not distinct. The understanding of samsara is itself posited as nirvana.”468It is crucial for Tsongkhapa to emphasize the connection between tran­scendent and empirical wisdom, and therefore also the connection between samsara and nirvana, since it is on this basis that he argues that transcen­dent knowledge is equivalent to the knowledge of phenomena as depend­ently arisen. Hence he argues that “dependently arisen, i.e., reality in its true nature, as seen by an arya, is free from all categories of prapanca, such as expression and expressed objects, definitions and defined objects, and the like.”469 In other words, as Bhikkhu Bodhi puts it, “the path to liberation is a path of understanding, of comprehension and transcendence, not of escapism or emotional self-indulgence. Nibbana can only be attained by turning one s gaze towards samsara and scrutinizing it in all its starkness.”470For Tsongkhapa the transcendence of the categories of prapanca need not and does not threaten the symbiotic relationship between the two truths. The transcendent experience remains firmly grounded in empirical reality while also allowing for epistemic transcendence: transcendent wisdom, underpinned by right view and firm ethical foundations, directs the mind upon the unconditioned so as to penetrate and cut through all the cate­gories of prapanca. Transcendent wisdom therefore destroys the mental"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"ii4THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEtendencies for the proliferation of prapanca, but it leaves the categories of prapanca intact. To borrow a simile from Buddhaghosa, just as a lamp simultaneously burns the wick, dispels the darkness, creates light, and con­sumes the oil, so transcendent wisdom simultaneously understands things as they are, abandons ignorance and the obsessions to proliferate prapan- cas, realizes nirvana, and develops the path to liberation. The key to tran­scendent knowledge, therefore, lies in the wisdom capable of penetrating the conceptual world—penetrating the five psychophysical aggregates of the knower. Such wisdom, Tsongkhapa argues, involves a direct experience that operates within the confines of ones own five psychophysical aggre­gates and yet sees through those aggregates.Gorampas transcendent epistemology, as we have seen, is geared toward metaphysical transcendence. This leads him to argue in favor of the absolute existence of the transcendent tathagata, the latter taken as identical with transcendent wisdom,471 while also insisting on the elimination of all the categories of prapanca—of the entire conventional system. While Tsong­khapa does argue in favor of epistemic transcendence, he also insists that transcendent knowledge does not actually eliminate all conceptual cate­gories: “The transcendence of conceptual categories means dissolving all the categories of prapanca—dualistic appearances— from the perspective of the transcendent wisdom capable of directly realizing ultimate reality.”472 Once transcendent knowledge is achieved, the meditator still makes use of dualities in practical contexts—to distinguish between, for instance, skill­ful and unskillful action, afflictions and nonafflictions—and yet the habit­ual tendency toward prapanca ceases, for the meditator now sees such dualities as part of ongoing processes rather than as inherently persisting discrete entities.Gorampas alternative transcendent position derives from his emphasis on the two truths and their cognitive counterparts as completely distinct from one another and hierarchically related. Since ultimate truth and tran­scendent wisdom are viewed as ontologically and epistemologically inde­pendent of their conventional counterparts, they must also be completely transcendent of those counterparts—both epistemologically and ontologi­cally. Likewise, Tsongkhapas contrasting emphasis on the unity of the two truths is the basis for his insistence on the merely epistemic character of transcendence. The unity of the two truths, and the modes of understand­ing associated with them, are not violated even at the climax of the tran­scendent experience.It may be said that while Gorampa mobilizes his transcendent epistemol-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH115ogy to enable a nonduality that is metaphysical, Tsongkhapa does so to enable the formulation of a nonduality that is merely epistemic. This brings the idea of nonduality itself to the fore.Nondual Epistemology[ManjusrI said:] Subhuti, the basic nature of the five aggregates is emptiness. If that nature is emptiness, there is neither “I” nor “mine.” If there is neither “I” nor “mine,” there is no duality. If there is no duality, there is neither grasping nor abandoning. If there is neither grasping nor abandoning, there is no attachment.Thus free of attachment, one transcends the mundane world.473The two Tibetan Prasangikas agree that the direct personal realization of ultimate truth requires the transcendence of all prapanca, and this in turn depends on the attainment of what is known as nondual knowledge. Thus a detailed analysis of nonduality is crucial to our discussion. This analysis will involve how and when the nondual state is attained; whether the nondual­ity at issue is epistemic or metaphysical; and what is implied by the attain­ment of the nondual state—particularly in relation to the dichotomy of subject and object.Tsongkhapa regards the nondual realization of ultimate truth as an epis­temic event. In his understanding nondual realization is possible, yet the apprehending consciousness—transcendent wisdom—retains its ontologi­cal distinctness as subject, and the cognitive sphere— ultimate reality—like­wise retains its ontological distinctness as object. Gorampa contends that nondual realization forms a single metaphysical reality—a total integration of subject and object. Only such a complete integration, according to him, resolves the problem of duality. Thus Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree that, from the standpoint of nondual wisdom, the meditator experiences a total dissolution of even the subtle duality between subject and object, but they disagree on the implications of this nondual experience. Tsongkhapa does not hold the achievement of nondual wisdom as equivalent to the cessation of cognitive activity, whereas for Gorampa it means exactly that.Tsongkhapas description of the way the meditator arrives at nondual understanding is as follows. The cognitive agent experiences a fusion of sub­jectivity and its object, which refer here not to self and outside world but rather to elements within the meditators own psychophysical aggregates."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"n6THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEThe meditator remains introspective, not engaging the outside world, but the outside world as such does not disappear. What occurs is instead a total cessation of the dualities between subject /and object mine, between thinker and thought, between feeler and feelings, between mind and body, between seeing and seen, and so forth.474 Initially a meditator perceives, for instance, that in each act of seeing, two factors are always present: the object seen and the act of seeing it. While each single act of seeing involves dissolution, the object seen and the act of seeing actually consist of numerous physical and mental processes that are seen to dissolve serially and successively.475 Even­tually, the meditator also notices the dissolution of the dissolution itself. In other words, the meditator first realizes the fluctuating and transitory char­acter of the five aggregates, which is then followed by the further realization of the aggregates as empty and selfless, and finally by the realization of the emptiness of even the empty and selfless phenomena. Nondual knowledge is thus arrived at, in Tsongkhapas view, through the direct experience of see­ing the truths within one s own aggregates, rather than through being con­vinced of the truth of certain abstractions through rational argument or persuasion. Since the process here is a cognitive experience that operates entirely within the domain of ones own psychophysical aggregates, it is therefore an epistemic but not a metaphysical nonduality.This is how, according to Tsongkhapa, an arya has direct nonconceptual and nondual access to the transcendent nature of his own five psychophys­ical aggregates during meditative equipoise. In the wake of meditative equipoise, an arya engages with dualistic worldly activities, such as taking part in philosophical discourse, practicing different social conventions, and so on. The arya will thus make use of socio-linguistic conventions, but since the arya has eradicated all reifying tendencies, even these worldly dualistic engagements will be seen as consistent with nondual wisdom. Both non­dual and dual wisdoms, especially in the case of a buddha, Tsongkhapa argues, are fully commensurate.As far as Gorampa is concerned, however, no dichotomy can be recon­ciled with nonduality and so with nondual knowledge. The key to attain­ing nondual knowledge is to eschew the dichotomy between ultimate reality as object and transcendent wisdom as subject. Gorampa maintains that it is impossible to achieve nonduality as long as the dichotomy between subject and object persists. His nonduality is thus a metaphysical unity requiring the fusion of transcendent wisdom with ultimate reality. They become a single entity, which he alternately describes as “transcendent wisdom,” “buddha,” “tathagata,” “ultimate truth,” or “ultimate reality.”"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH117“Because one has realized emptiness and attained a perfect integration with it,” says Gorampa, “the adventitious stains wear out. Eventually the cogni­tion itself becomes an undefiled cognitive sphere. This itself is the ultimate buddha, who is adorned with the perfections of abandonment and realiza­tion.”476 From this point onward, “ultimate reality, empirical reality, and subjective wisdom—all three lose their contradistinctions”— they all liter­ally become one unified phenomenon.477Gorampa argues that existence, nonexistence, both, and neither constitute the four extreme conceptual elaborations. “Once they are simultaneously eliminated, the individuality of cognizing mind and cognized reality ceases to appear.”478 He claims that “the cognizing mind inseparably embraces the transcendence of conceptual elaboration as its object, and that itself is desig­nated as ultimate truth.”479 In other words, as Shakya Chogden puts it: “The actual cognitive sphere of the [nondual] wisdom of meditative equipoise directly realizing emptiness is the wisdom itself.”480 For both Gorampa and Shakya Chogden, then, “this wisdom is the ultimate truth, for it is the actual cognitive domain of the wisdom of the meditative equipoise...This holds true because this wisdom is the direct personal wisdom.”481The advocacy of such an absolute nondual wisdom is not unique to Gorampa and Shakya Chogden. Despite minor differences, several Tibetan Prasangikas hold a similar view. Like Gorampa, Karmapa Mikyo Dorje emphasizes the synthesis between transcendent wisdom and ultimate truth, arguing that “there is neither separate ultimate truth apart from the transcen­dent wisdom, nor transcendent wisdom apart from the ultimate truth.”482 Mipham Rinpoche, on the other hand, employs a more idealistic route to absolute nonduality: “In the end, there are no external objects. It is evident that they appear due to the force of mental predisposition.. .All texts that supposedly demonstrate the existence of external objects are provisional [descriptions of] their appearances.”483 Consequently whatever is posited as existent, according to Mipham Rinpoche, “is like a horse or an elephant appearing in a dream. When it is subjected to logical analysis, it finally boils down to the interdependent inner predispositions. And this is at the heart of Buddhist philosophy.”484 The climax of this absolute nonduality, for these thinkers, is the absolute realization of transcendent wisdom and the com­plete collapse or dissolution of the entire conventional system. Identical with ultimate truth, transcendent wisdom survives as the one and only truth. Transcendent wisdom becomes timeless, absolute, and unaffected by change. Even the concept of time is no longer applicable, since transcendent wisdom endures eternally—“it neither arises nor ceases,” as Gorampa puts it.485"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"i i8THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATECentral to Gorampas doctrine of nonduality are several key idealistic conceptions. He does not hesitate to reconcile conceptions derived from the Yogacara or Vijnanavada School—such as that of vijnaptimatra (mam rig tsam) (representation) or of cittamdtra (sems tsam) (mind only)—with Prasangika Madhyamaka.486 He contends that the external world is a sys­tem of purely mental constructs and that the five sensory consciousnesses perceiving the phenomenal world arise from the foundational conscious­ness, or alayavijnana (kun gzhi mam shes).A%1 This latter idea is one of the fundamental elements of Yogacara idealism. Alayavijnana is characterized as devoid of intentional activity, self-luminous and self-knowing, and is seen as the primary cause of all sensory experience. For the alayavijnana is the storehouse of all past karmic seeds—both defilements and virtues, which ripen as unpleasant or pleasant experiences upon meeting with the appropriate conditions. Alayavijnana is thus regarded as the foundation of both samsara and nirvana. According to both Gorampa and the proponents of Yogacara idealism, it is transcendent of the dualism of subject and object, existence and nonexistence, death and birth, purity and defilements, aris­ing and cessation, and is described as dharmadhatu, nirvana, or tathdgata- garbha (buddha nature).In defending the conception of the foundation consciousness, Sogyal Rinpoche, for example, writes: “There is the very nature of mind, its inner­most essence, which is absolutely and always untouched by change or death. At present it is hidden within our own mind, our sems, enveloped and obscured by the mental scurry of our thoughts and emotions,” but, he goes on, “just as clouds can be shifted by a strong gust of wind to reveal the shin­ing sun and wide-open sky, so, under certain special circumstances, some inspiration may uncover for us glimpses of this nature of mind.”488 Sogyal Rinpoche also explains that, despite having varying depths and degrees, these glimpses each bring some light of understanding, meaning, and free­dom. “This is because the nature of mind is the very root itself of under­standing. In Tibetan we call it Rigpa, a primordial, pure, pristine awareness that is at once intelligent, cognizant, radiant, and always awake. It could be said to be the knowledge of knowledge itself.”489 This is in complete accord with Gorampas views.So in brief, in the nondualism postulated by Gorampa, the ultimate task of wisdom is to break through the diversity of appearances in order to dis­cover the unifying nondual reality. This way of understanding the task of wisdom abolishes the validity of all conventional dualities, including the duality between subject and object. In Lindtner’s terms: “Reality (tattva) is"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH119beyond all ontological and epistemological dualities (dvaya)y while the empirical world of origination, destruction, and so forth is illusory—due merely to ignorance (avidya)”m By using the epistemology of nonduality, Gorampa argues for a metaphysics of nonduality. As we will see in the next section, the formulation of his metaphysical nonduality reaches its culmi­nation with the proposition of nothingness in place of emptiness.Unlike Gorampa, Tsongkhapa holds that even the highest level of wis­dom preserves duality and diversity. He asserts that Prasangika Madhya­maka draws our attention to empirical dualities—among them the duality of morality and immorality—and takes them as the indispensable basis for any genuine search for liberating wisdom. For Tsongkhapa, then, nondual­ity must be taken as a strictly epistemic process. In the section after next this view will be reinforced by showing that for Tsongkhapa even nondual knowledge is consistent with knowing phenomena as empty. It follows, therefore, that nondual knowledge is equivalent to knowing phenomena as dependently arisen, and is thus consistent with dual knowledge.Seeing Phenomena as NothingGorampa sees transcendent wisdom as an absolute, and he also holds that the attainment of this wisdom amounts to the realization of nondual real­ity. But what does that realization consist of? Does transcendent wisdom involve any cognitive activity? If the answer is positive, so that transcendent wisdom, understood as “seeing by not seeing,” is indeed taken to involve cognitive activity, then why should the “seeing” in this case be characterized as “not seeing”? If the answer is negative, meaning an absence of any cogni­tive activity, then why is the “not seeing” of transcendent wisdom charac­terized as “seeing”? To phrase it slightly differently: transcendent wisdom involves either a form of cognition, in which case it requires a distinction between cognizer and cognized, or else there is no distinction between cog- nizer and the object of cognition, in which case transcendent wisdom is not a form of cognition.Even among his closest allies, Gorampas treatment of the transcendent nature of conceptual elaboration in a nondual state is highly contentious. It revolves around two important moves: firstly, he argues that the transcen­dence of conceptual elaborations in a nondual state is equivalent to engag­ing with an utter absence or nothingness; and secondly, he argues that ultimate cognition does not depend upon a dichotomy between subject and object. Gorampa writes that “the transcendence of conceptual elaboration"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"120THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEis equivalent to an utter absence of any established entity,” but he also insists that “in order to ensure the realization of that utter absence per se by the devotees, the transcendence of conceptual elaboration is presented as an arbitary model of ultimate truth.”491 According to this view “a model that actually represents the characteristic [of ultimate truth] cannot exist.”492 However, for the benefit of devotees, “ultimate truth is said to have been provisionally presented by means of the threefold conventional fabrica­tions—definition (mtshan nyid, laksana), definiendum (mtshon bya, laksman), and the defined model (mtshan gzhi, laksya). In this sense alone ultimate truth can be treated as the counterpart of conventional truth.”493 It transpires, therefore, that ultimate truth is not an object of knowledge in the sense that it can become known to its cognizing consciousness. It is sim­ply an utter absence of anything empirical.In order to establish the nondual character of ultimate cognition, Gorampa attempts to resolve the apparent dichotomy between transcen­dent wisdom (the putative subject) and emptiness (the putative object):[Question]: When you earlier defined transcendence of conceptual elaboration, you mentioned that it is free from all symbols of expression and objects of expression, from object and subject, and from negation and affirmation; here you praised it thus. Is this not like describing the qualities of the “sky flower” [i.e., a nonexistent entity], which cannot be known?[Gorampa]: Yes, [you are right. Talking about the transcen­dence of conceptual elaboration is exactly like describing the qualities of something nonexistent]. However, its description, even in this context, is not meant to suggest the existence of [duality] between the consciousness realizing [the transcendence of conceptual elaboration] and its experienced object or an object to be experienced [in the nondual state]...The elimina­tion of conceptual elaboration in its entirety by an aryas noncon­ceptual wisdom is itself considered the realization of emptiness, or is merely expressed as seeing the truth. If any object, either to be conceptualized or to be experienced, were involved [in the nondual state], it would, at best, be a universal or a thing [but not ultimate truth] .494Given his commitment to a metaphysical nonduality, any subject-object duality presents a problem for Gorampa. He is therefore determined to"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH121eliminate all possible dichotomies, which he achieves by equating the sta­tus of apprehended objects with universals. Here universal dots not have the usual sense of abstractness but rather refers to the objects themselves. Gorampa therefore argues that if, in the nondual state, there is an object to be either conceptualized or experienced, then “at best it would be a univer­sal or a thing.” Since thing, and therefore universal, cannot be an ultimate truth, emptiness, in Gorampas sense, must mean the utter absence of empirical truth. In this way transcendent wisdom is undifferentiated from nothingness. This undifferentiated transcendent wisdom does indeed sat­isfy the definition of being nondual in the most complete sense— it is beyond all cognitive activities, both perceptual and conceptual. It would seem that as long as the cognitive activities between cognizing subject and cognized object persist, the mind must always remain caught up in percep­tual or conceptual operations. Moreover both thought and perception operate always within the domain of duality between subject and object. Since the persistence of such dualities constitute, in Gorampas view, obsta­cles to the achievement of the nondual state, then those obstacles must be removed if that state is to be achieved.In the nondual system advocated by Gorampa, there can be no transcen­dent cognitive content apart from transcendent cognition, since this would constitute a version of what is, for Gorampa, the highly problematic dichotomy between subject and object. Since the presence of any cognitive activity between subject and object threatens the achievement of nondual­ity, Gorampa insists that emptiness must be an utter absence—it cannot be an object of knowledge or a cognitive content, and nondual wisdom must embrace it without any duality or dichotomy. “Grasping and nongrasping are two,” says the Vimalakirtinirdesa Sutray and that is dualistic. “Thus, the inaction and noninvolvement of all things is the entrance into nondual­ity.”495 By treating emptiness as an utter absence rather than a cognitive con­tent, and nondual wisdom as a contentless cognition, Gorampa effectively resolves the problem of the apparent dichotomy between the objectivity of ultimate reality and the subjectivity of transcendent wisdom. Thus what remains is an absolute, nondual, and transcendent subject itself.The view that equates emptiness with an utter absence is, once again, not unique to Gorampa. In fact, Taktsang Lotsawa,496 along with Gendun Chopel, explicitly endorses this view. Gendun Chopel, for instance, argues that in the meditative equipoise there is no apprehended object whatsoever: “When it is fused with the appearance in the postmeditative equipoise, the union is formed in between the nothingness during the meditative equipoise"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"122THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEand the appearances of something during the subsequent attainment.”497 This is how “the meaning of the establishment of ultimately nothing and the establishment of empirically something should be understood.”498This view that equates emptiness with nothingness is vigorously chal­lenged, not only by numerous Gelug philosophers—such as Tsongkhapa,499 Khedrub Je,500 and Jamyang Shepai Dorje501—but also by several non- Gelug thinkers, such as Sakya Pandita,502 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen, and Mipham Rinpoche. In criticizing the doctrine, Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen, for example, points out that the equation of seeing nothingness With, the non­dual state in meditative equipoise would entirely incapacitate the purgative potency of vipasyana—penetrating wisdom. As the most important task of the wisdom of vipasyana is the eradication of latent defilements, this is a serious objection. If meditative equipoise were equivalent to seeing noth­ingness, “like a nondiscerning meditative trance,” then meditative equipoise “would utterly lack the active penetrating insight of vipasyana see­ing emptiness.”503 Moreover if the equivalence of meditative equipoise with seeing nothingness were accepted, “even sleep, falling into coma, and so on, would equally purge [the latent defilements], since they also possess mere nondiscernment.”504 In similar fashion, Mipham Rinpoche joins Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen in challenging the equation of seeing nothingness with the nondual wisdom of meditative equipoise. While reinforcing Rongton Shakya Gyaltsens criticisms, Mipham Rinpoche brands Gorampas view as nothing short of quietism—a view, also attributed to the Chinese Hva Shang, that takes cognitive disengagement to be a matter of ceasing all cog­nitive activities.505 To take the validity of meditative equipoise as consisting in seeing nothingness is equivalent, in Mipham Rinpoche’s view, to endors­ing Hva Shang’s insistence on stilling thoughts and becoming almost zom­bie-like: “It is the stilling of mind to attain the quietism without analysis, but that would lack the illuminating power of vipasyana. Thus, like a stone on the ocean bed, one eternally remains in the ordinary state.”506The attain­ment of total freedom from latent impurities would then become impossi­ble. Mipham Rinpoche reveals another absurdity inherent in the doctrine that equates emptiness with nothingness:If one maintains not seeing as seeing emptiness, since the mode of reality is so profound, there is an acute danger of erring. As mind is not an object bearing a physical form, nobody is able to see its color and so forth. To think that merely not seeing constitutes realizing emptiness is certainly committing a grave error. It is not"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH123possible to see a cows horn on a man’s head even after analyzing it a hundred times. It would be easy indeed for anyone, were not seeing itself sufficient to realize emptiness....For the erroneous view that apprehends nothing whatso­ever, no thing whatsoever is established. There is no way to develop the ascertainment. It will have thus no capacity whatso­ever to eliminate obstructions [of nirvana and buddhahood]. Therefore, just as fire is inferred from smoke, the difference between the two [vipasyana and seeing nothingness] should be understood on account of its conduciveness to the realization [of reality] and the abandonment [of defilements].507In short, by proposing, as we saw in the previous section, a doctrine of absolute transcendent wisdom, and by proposing, as we have seen here, a doctrine of nothingness, Gorampa argues that a nondual state, strictly speaking, must refer to a transcendent wisdom that is totally free of all cog­nitive activity. His insistence on metaphysical nonduality leads him to dis­count all cognitive content and activity as utterly inconsistent with such nonduality. Because he takes nonduality to be absolute, Gorampa must insist on the complete elimination of the phenomenal world as the object of negation, he must equate emptiness with nothingness,508 and he must also take the full realization of nonduality as arrived at only when the subject- object dichotomy completely collapses. Harvey describes it as “the experi­ence of transcendent knowledge, which is an undifferentiated unity, beyond the subject-object duality and a concept of any kind, even ‘thought.’ It is thought which is no longer what is usually meant by ‘thought,’ as it is without object, contentless.”509 Small wonder then that the water analogy strikes Gorampa so powerfully. Just as two jars of clear water form an inseparable mixture, Gorampas nondualism requires a total fusion of subject and object. Tsongkhapa, on the other hand, does not equate emptiness with nothingness—yet he insists that it is possible, nev­ertheless, to achieve nondual awareness.Seeing Phenomena as Empty[The Buddha said]: “Mahakas'yapa, to one who has the true insight, things are empty, not because one contemplates them as empty; they are empty by nature. Things are signless, not because one contemplates them as signless; they are signless in themselves."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"124THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEThings are unsought, not because one contemplates them as unsought; they are unsought in themselves. Things are devoid of origination, arising, entity, and self-nature; they are impossible to grasp, not because one contemplates them as such; they are so in themselves. This understanding is called true insight.”510As we have seen, Tsongkhapa is entirely opposed to the formulation of a metaphysical nonduality and instead directs his efforts toward the defense of an epistemic nonduality. Thus he posits that it is possible to attain non­dual awareness even though the metaphysical distinction between subjec­tivity and objectivity remains. But how credible is Tsongkhapas nonduality if it retains the metaphysical duality of subject and object?To see ultimate truth nondually is, in his view, to see phenomena as empty, and given the conceptual unity between emptiness and dependent arising, so, in experiential terms, to see phenomena as empty is also to see phenomena as dependently arisen. It is critical therefore to understand the nature of the conceptual unity between emptiness and dependent arising, for the same principle of conceptual unity must be applied on the experi­ential level to resolve the tension between knowing phenomena as empty, therefore nondually, and knowing them as dependently arisen, therefore dually. Here the issue of the unity of the two truths becomes central.Candraklrti and Tsongkhapa both defend the validity of nondual epis­temic access to ultimate truth by applying the conceptual unity between emptiness and dependent arising on the empirical, experiential level. In commenting on Aryadevas Catuhsataka (15:10), Candraklrti argues that seeing phenomena as empty should not be equated with seeing “the son of an infertile woman”—which is to say that seeing phenomena as empty should not be construed as seeing nothingness or the mere absence of empir­ical realities.511 Given the compatible relationship between dependent aris­ing and emptiness, “a correct seeing of phenomena as dependently arisen should lead to seeing them as illusory, and strictly not as the son of an infer­tile woman.”512 Candraklrti argues that “Prasangika Madhyamikas...posit things as illusory and the like because they fear that it might otherwise absurdly lead to undermining the existence of dependently arisen phenom­ena. They do not agree with such [nihilistic] advocates.”513 Candraklrti fur­ther explains: “When things are subjected to logical analysis... because the essence of things remains unestablished, the illusory-like nature of each indi­vidual object should remain as the remainder.”514 Tsongkhapa also reiterates that “there is no inconsistency whatsoever should the repudiation of the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH125essence be followed by a cognition of objects as having mere illusory mean­ing. It is in fact vital.”515However, the cognition of anything positive by the ultimately valid con­sciousness as opposed to empirically valid consciousness—even the cogni­tion of an illusory object—is problematic from that ultimate perspective. All the Prasangika Madhyamikas agree that the ultimately valid conscious­ness does not itself positively affirm any object. For it to do so would be tantamount to an affirmation of the existence of essence in the face of analysis, but this would be radically inconsistent with the central meta­physics of the Prasangika Madhyamaka, namely, the thesis that nothing in the world has an essence that can defy or withstand critical analysis. “It would therefore be inconsistent for the reasoning consciousness—analyz­ing whether essence exists—itself to cognize the existence of even a merely illusory object.”516 This process of engaging with ultimate truth by not affirming anything in particular, rather actively eliminating everything, is precisely what is med dgag (Skt. prasajyapratisedhd). In Dreyfuss words: “For Tsong kha pa, emptiness is a negation (dgagpa, pratisedha) and must be understood in terms of the negation of the putative object of negation (dgag bya)?517For Tsongkhapas critics, however, “this approach to emptiness is ques­tionable,” as Dreyfus observes. They interpret Tsongkhapas use of the term med dgag as “absolute negation” (to use Pettits phrase) in the metaphysical sense, and assume that he is clinging to ultimate truth as an absolute nega­tion (because he recognizes the identity of emptiness and ultimate truth). From his critics’ point of view, Tsongkhapa stands accused of advocating the doctrine of Madhyamaka nihilism. Gorampa, in the Lta ba ngan sel (Eliminating the Erroneous View), accuses Tsongkhapa of being “seized by demons” (bdud kyis zin pa) and in the Lta bdi shan ybyed (Distinguishing Views) decries him as a “nihilistic Madhyamika” (dbu ma chad lta ba) who is spreading “demonic words” (bdud kyi tshig^).518 Tsongkhapa, on the con­trary, argues that his notion of meddgag \\s an epistemic one, although not denying its ontological implication. To be precise, med dgag is an epistemic elimination of all prapancas in order to have a direct vision of emptiness.Just as not seeing ultimate reality by the dual empirically valid con­sciousness does not imply the nonexistence of ultimate truth, so, too, argues Tsongkhapa, “not seeing conventionalities in the nondual state does not lead to the breakdown of the unity between characterized objects and their characteristics since their relationship is not posited from the vantage point of the reasoning consciousness realizing ultimate reality.”519 From"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"126THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthe perspective of the empirically valid cognition that verifies things such as color and shape, ultimate truth is nonexistent. But it does not follow from this that ultimate truth is itself nonexistent. Similarly, as Pettit encap­sulates Tsongkhapas points: “If an ultimate analysis finds no sprouts, that does not mean that sprout does not exist at all, but only that it is empty of inherent existence.” He further adds: “If a conventional analysis finds a sprout, that is not the same as finding an inherent existence (svabhava, rang bzhin) of a sprout, which could only be found by an analysis of the ulti­mate status of a sprout—and of course never is.”520 These epistemic para­digms demonstrate, according to Tsongkhapa, that while ultimate truth and its verifying transcendent wisdom are directly related, dual empirical wisdom and nondual ultimate truth are related indirectly521— they are, in fact, mutually supportive. Indeed, without mutual support between empirical wisdom and transcendent wisdom, the attainment of a nondual state is, in Tsongkhapas view, impossible. Since the two truths and the two modes of understanding are mutually interlocking, so, despite the nond­uality of experience during the meditative equipoise, this nondual experi­ence still operates within the epistemic domain and therefore has to have an empirical ground.Thus, although nondual transcendent wisdom gives access to ultimate truth, Tsongkhapa argues that this wisdom does not do so in isolation from dual empirical wisdom. Nondual transcendent wisdom is itself an empiri­cal phenomenon, and it is not therefore an empirically transcendent truth, as Gorampa would have it. Just as nondual wisdom requires dual empiri­cal wisdom as its grounding, so dual empirical wisdom requires nondual wisdom to validate its epistemic authority. In this way both cognitive resources mutually support each other, thereby enabling the agent con­cerned to realize the truth pertaining to the five aggregates from both dual and nondual standpoints. Just as seeing phenomena as empty and seeing them as dependently arisen interlock in all circumstances, so, Tsongkhapa contends, the nondual knowledge of ultimate truth and the dual knowl­edge of conventional truth universally interlock epistemologically and ontologically.Were Tsongkhapa to argue that the ultimate reasoning consciousness, in isolation from empirical consciousness, sees things as dependently arisen, then he would incongruously be obliged to suppose that an arya or a buddha sees conceptual elaborations while in the nondual state, and so to deny the possibility of the transcendence of conceptual elaborations even in that state; this would then force him to accept conceptual elaborations as withstanding"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH127or defying ultimate analysis, which would imply the existence of their essences. According to the standard Madhyamaka position accepted by Tsongkhapa, a failure to transcend conceptual elaborations by nondual or transcendent wisdom would mean a failure to grasp the true meaning of ultimate reality. “If ultimate truth were seen in terms of discrete objects, such as the psychophysical aggregates, seeing them, for instance, as the domain of touch, of expression, and of mind from the perspective of con­sciousnesses realizing the ultimate rather than seeing them by way of not seeing,” then, Tsongkhapa argues, “ultimate truth would not be beyond conceptual elaborations.”522 Seeing ultimate truth as free from any duality is coherent and noncontradictory from the perspective of nondual wisdom, but not from the perspective of dual empirical wisdom.It is important to note, however, that to see ultimate truth as nondual wisdom sees it, without seeing phenomena in discrete terms, does not mean that nondual wisdom is seeing nothing or is devoid of cognitive content or activity. For Tsongkhapa nondual wisdom sees the empty or ultimate mode of ones identity, and of one’s five psychophysical aggregates, while dual wis­dom sees the conventional, dependently arisen mode of ones identity, and of one’s five aggregates. The only contrast between these two modes of see­ing is that the former sees its object negatively while the latter sees its object positively. The dual and nondual knowledge of an arya buddha, in partic­ular, are equally valid—the wisdom that understands phenomena as empty also understands them as dependently arisen, and vice versa. A nondual experience of ultimate truth does not undermine the status of conventional truth, since the realization of ultimate truth is equivalent to that of conven­tional truth. It follows therefore that if nondual knowledge is a correct knowledge of ultimate truth, it should necessarily be equivalent to the dual knowledge of phenomena as dependently arisen.Tsongkhapa therefore sees no contradiction in claiming that, from the empirical standpoint, nondual wisdom constitutes the subjective pole of consciousnesses with ultimate truth as its objective counterpart.523 From the ultimate vantage point, on the other hand, nondual wisdom and ulti­mate truth “are free from the duality of act (bya ba) and object acted upon (byedpa).”524 In the nondual state even the cognitive interplay between sub­ject and object appears, from the meditator’s point of view, to cease com­pletely. This is because, as Tsongkhapa points out, “duality of act and object acted upon is posited strictly from the perspective of empirical cogni­tion.”525 The dual appearances of subject and object completely dissolve from the perspective of nondual wisdom, and thus the meditator does not"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"128THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEexperience the mutual interaction between distinct and separate ele­ments—between the seer and the seen—but the meditator nonetheless engages in an act of mere seeing. As the Buddha explains to Bahiya:In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself...then Bahiya, there is no you in terms of that. When there is no you in terms of that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.526The experience of mere seeing in a nondual form is valid only when it is empirically grounded and when there is cognitive activity occurring between nondual wisdom and nondual ultimate truth. Tsongkhapa main­tains, in fact, that the activity between subject and object is inevitable in any acquisition of valid knowledge. It is thus consistent to argue that non­dual wisdom involves a knowing subject and ultimate truth involves a known object.527Tsongkhapas main purpose in attaining nondual knowledge is not to eschew the subject-object dichotomy. The purpose, as he sees it, is rather to purify deluded cognitive states and destroy ego-tainted emotions in the service of bodhicitta—the goal of attaining full enlightenment in order to free all beings from suffering and its causes. Both the dual and nondual per­spectives are required for success on the path, and that is why Tsongkhapa creates no hierarchy between them. One cannot eliminate negativity with­out a proper appreciation for empirical cause and effect, and one cannot eliminate the root delusion about an essential self without penetrating the ultimate truth.We can thus summarize our discussion of nonduality as follows. Tsong- khapa’s account of nondual knowledge rests largely on the unity of the two truths and therefore of emptiness and dependent arising. The attainment of nondual knowledge, according to his view, requires an eradication of ignorance and other reifying tendencies, and does not require any meta­physical shift. More specifically, such attainment does not require the estab­lishment of a metaphysical unity between subject and object, nor the eschewal of conventionalities.Gorampa, however, differs in claiming that nondual wisdom necessarily undermines the validity of conventionalities. Indeed, as long as dependently"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH129arisen phenomena are recognized, he holds that nondual knowledge will be impossible. This would be so even for an arya or a buddha, who instead of experiencing ultimate truth during meditative equipoise would experience only conceptual elaborations, that is, conventionalities. The fact that con­ventionalities are not seen during meditative equipoise, argues Gorampa, suggests that their ontological status is wholly undermined by the attain­ment of nondual wisdom. Dependently arisen phenomena are effectively eradicated by nondual transcendent wisdom, and excluded from the non­dual wisdom of an arya or a buddha. From Gorampas perspective, the non­dual knowledge of ultimate reality is valid only when that knowledge is totally divorced from the realization of phenomena as dependently arisen; from Tsongkhapas perspective, such knowledge is valid only when linked with the realization of phenomena as dependently arisen.In the Mahdratnakiita Sutra the Buddha reminds us of the poignant dan­gers associated with the doctrine of emptiness: “If one thinks that he has realized emptiness and becomes attached to emptiness, then he regresses in the pursuit of the Buddhadharma.”528 From a soteriological and ethical per­spective, entertaining a view of self is better than an attachment to a non­view, namely, a view of selflessness: “Thus, Kasyapa, it is better for one to take a view of the self as massive as Mount Sumeru than to take a view of emptiness and becoming arrogant. Why? Because all views can be elimi­nated by emptiness, but if one gives rise to the view of emptiness, there is no way to do away with it.”529 Emptiness is prescribed to eliminate all views, as the patient is prescribed medicine to eliminate illness. However, just as there is no cure for the illness if the medicine itself turns to poison, there will be no elimination of views if emptiness itself becomes another view— “Kasyapa, all views can be eliminated by emptiness, but the view of empti­ness cannot be eradicated,” says the Buddha.530ConclusionIn the Condensed Perfection of Wisdom Sutra the Buddha says:Forms are not seen, and sensations are also not seen; unseen is recognition, and unseen is mind. Wherever consciousnesses (shes pa, jndtd), mind (sems, citta), and mental cognition (yid, manas) are unseen, that itself is explained as seeing Dharma by tatha- gatas. Using words, sentient beings say that [they have] seen space."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEExamine how they see space. The Tathagata explains that seeing Dharma [ultimate reality] is similar. No other metaphor could illustrate the seeing of [ultimate reality].531Tsongkhapa and Gorampa basically agree in recognizing ultimate truth as an object of knowledge and recognizing nonconceptual wisdom as the cor­responding subject; they both accept the negative approach—seeing by way of not seeing— as necessary to arrive at knowledge of ultimate reality; and they both view the achievement of ultimate truth by its cognizing con­sciousness as possible only through the transcendence of conceptual cate­gories. A huge gulf nevertheless exists between these two thinkers on these issues. Tsongkhapa argues for an epistemic nonduality while avoiding a metaphysical nonduality. Despite taking ultimate reality to be realized by way of not seeing any duality, Tsongkhapa draws no metaphysical conclu­sion and does not abolish the dichotomy of subjectivity and objectivity. Gorampa, on the other hand, employs an epistemic model of nonduality to arrive at a metaphysical nonduality. Since ultimate reality is seen without see­ing any dualistic appearance, Gorampa argues, the contradistinctions be­tween subjectivity and objectivity are henceforth lost; the transcendent subject and the transcendent object form a single metaphysical unity that can be interchangeably described as transcendent wisdom, buddha, or tathagata.Tsongkhapa consistently never abandons the idea of cognitive interac­tion between ultimate truth and ultimate wisdom throughout his transcen­dent epistemology. Ultimate truth is consistently recognized as an object of knowledge, while transcendent wisdom is recognized as its subjective coun­terpart. In Gorampas case, since he upholds a metaphysical nonduality, absolute transcendent wisdom can have no separate cognitive sphere asso­ciated with it. For him, the claim that ultimate reality is an object of knowl­edge is merely a metaphor; the only true and reliable knowledge is completely nondual. Hence Gorampa consistently eschews the cognitive resources of conventional knowledge and its counterpart, conventional truth. To ensure that there is no duality whatsoever, he even rejects the dichotomy between the transcendent sphere and transcendent wisdom— the transcendent sphere, namely, emptiness, is equated with nothingness, while transcendent wisdom is itself a becoming one with that nothingness. Thus Gorampa is able to formulate an account of nondual wisdom as being without both content and activity—involving no object of knowledge dis­tinct from the cognizing consciousness. Transcendent wisdom itself"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"REALIZING ULTIMATE TRUTH131becomes both subject and object such that, strictly speaking, there is noth­ing to be known and only the nondual knower remains.Both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa describe nondual knowledge as being like a process of “mixing water.” They contend that the fusion between sub­jectivity and objectivity, from the meditators point of view, is like mixing clean water from two different jars by pouring it all into one jar. Thus Tsongkhapa argues: “From the vantage point of the wisdom that directly realizes ultimate reality, there is not even the slightest duality between object and the object-possessing consciousness. Like mixing water with water, [the yogi] dwells in the meditative equipoise.”532 He insists, however, that this metaphor should not be taken too far or too literally. It refers only to the cognitive process and does not indicate a metaphysical unity. Gorampa, on the other hand, insists on taking this analogy in its most literal sense: just as the clean water from the two separate jars, when poured together, merge without any trace of their prior separation, so, with the achievement of transcendent wisdom and the realization of ultimate reality, the elements that previously appeared separate are merged in a single, complete, meta­physical unity. As he sees it, only if it is grounded in such a metaphysical basis can the dissolution of the duality between subject and object be meaningful."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"5. Enlightenment[Manjusrl said to the Buddha]: “So be it, World-Honored One.If good men and good women wish to know the state of buddhahood, they should know that it is not a state of the eye, the nose, the tongue, the body, or the mind; nor is it a state of forms, sounds, scents, tastes, textures, or mental objects. World-Honored One, the nonstate is the state of buddhahood. This being the case, what is the state of supreme enlighten­ment as attained by the Buddha?” The Buddha said: “It is the state of emptiness, because all views are equal. It is the state of signlessness, because all signs are equal. It is the state of wishlessness, because three realms are equal. It is the state of nonaction, because all actions are equal. It is the state of the unconditioned, because all conditioned things are equal.”533IntroductionTs o n g k h a p a and Gorampa are both committed to the standard Madhyamaka position on the unique cognitive abilities of a fully enlightened being. They agree that a buddha is an all-knowing cog­nitive agent and that enlightenment represents an unparalleled cognitive achievement. Yet, although both agree also that an enlightened being is able to know all objects of knowledge in the span of a single temporal instant, they disagree on a number of crucial issues concerning the nature of enlight­enment, including the question of exactly how, and in what ways, an enlightened wisdom knows all objects of knowledge.In this final chapter we compare Tsongkhapa and Gorampas positions regarding the nature of enlightenment, the characteristics of enlightened knowledge, and how such knowledge is different from and superior to the knowledge of the other aryas. In the course of this comparison we will see that for Tsongkhapa the unparalleled cognitive potential of enlightenment133"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"134THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATElies in its ability to access the two truths simultaneously within a single event of wisdom, whereas for Gorampa it lies in its capacity to access just one truth— metaphysically transcendent ultimate truth—within a single cog­nitive event.We begin by analyzing what is called the universality of ultimate truth. This universality is directly related to the way an enlightened wisdom knows reality as it pertains to all objects of knowledge. Both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa hold that it is precisely because the universality of ultimate truth is exhaustively embraced by an enlightened wisdom that such wisdom can be said to know the ultimate truth of all objects of knowledge.The Universality of Ultimate Truth[The Buddha speaks to Manjus'ri] “All the Dharmas I teach are of one taste—the taste of detachment, liberation, and ultimate quiescence. What is taught by a good man or a good woman who has acquired the Single Deed Samadhi is also of one taste—the taste of detachment, liberation, and ultimate quiescence—and is unerringly consistent with the true Dharma. Manjus'ri, a great Bodhisattva who has acquired the Single Deed Samadhi has ful­filled all the conditions conducive to his swift attainment of supreme enlightenment.”534Before turning to the two Tibetans, we will first consider Candraklrti s com­ments on the universality of ultimate truth. In explaining the unique way an enlightened being realizes reality, Candraklrti writes in the Madhya- makavatdra, “Despite the divisions created by vessels, space is itself without any divisions. Similarly, any division created by things is not present in ulti­mate reality. Hence,” he adds, “by fully accomplishing the realization of the uniformity [of all phenomena], you noble knower comprehend all objects of knowledge in a single instant.”535Tsongkhapa and Gorampa use similar terminology in commenting on this passage. Despite the fact that space is variously divided by containers and other objects, the space inside those containers is characterized as a “mere absence of all obstructing entity.” The space inside the vessels thus remains uniformly “undivided.” Similarly, although there are manifold divisions of phenomena produced by their respective causes and conditions, the ultimate truth pertaining to them shares the same uniform nature. The"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT135ultimate truth of each conditioned phenomenon possesses the characteris­tic of nonarisingy a characteristic uniformly shared by all phenomena. In this sense, ultimate reality is shared by all phenomena without any division, just as the space inside various vessels is one and the same space.Thus far Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree,536 but a closer examination reveals striking differences. Ontologically, Tsongkhapa maintains a plural­istic standpoint in contrast to the monism of Gorampa. Despite his com­mitment to the universality of ultimate truth, according to which ultimate truths share similar natures, Tsongkhapa asserts that each empirical truth has its own ultimate truth. Gorampa, however, precisely because of his commitment to the universality of ultimate truth, insists there is only one ultimate truth for all empirical phenomena. Epistemologically, Tsongkhapa argues that enlightened wisdom accesses the universality of ultimate truth by virtue of having knowledge of both the empirical and ultimate truths; Gorampa argues that the enlightened person has knowledge of ultimate truth alone. Lets look at these claims more closely.We first consider matters from the ontological standpoint. Although all empirically given truths—such as the aggregates of form, feelings, and so on—are contingently produced and have diverse conventional characters, all of them, according to Tsongkhapa, are ultimately empty of inherent exis­tence. They share this universal characteristic, literally, “one taste” (ro gcig, ekarasa). The Buddha, for example, makes this statement: “Just as the great ocean has but one taste, the taste of salt, even so does this Dharma and dis­cipline have but one taste, the taste of release.”537 The Samddhirdjasutradlso tells us: “By knowing one, all are known. And by seeing one, all are seen. Despite many things being said about [ultimate truth] in conventional terms, no arrogance should arise from it.”538 Furthermore, “Just as you have recognized Cdu shes) [the true nature of your own] personality, so you should apply the same insight to all [phenomena]. All phenomena are of the [same] nature like clear space.”539 In the Gaganagamjasamddhi Sutra it is stated: “Whoever by meditating on one phenomenon knows all phenom­ena as apprehensible like illusions and mirages, and knows them as hollow, false, and ephemeral, will before long reach the summum bonum (snyingpo) of enlightenment.”540 And Aryadeva also says: “Whosoever sees one is said to see all. That which is emptiness of one is the emptiness of all.”541 Refer­ring to this last passage from Aryadeva, Candraklrti comments:The emptiness of the essence of form is itself the emptinesses ofthe essences of the aggregates such as feeling. Similarly, the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"136THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEemptiness of the essence of the eye-source is itself the emptinesses of the essences of all twelve sources. Likewise, the emptiness of the essence of the eye-constituent is itself the emptinesses of the essences of all eighteen constituents. Equally so are [the empti­nesses of the essences of] the infinite categories of things due to the distinct divisions in things, locations, times, and contexts.For whatever is the emptiness of the essence of one thing is itself the emptinesses of the essences of all things. In spite of the fact that jars and bowls for example are distinct, space is not distinct. While things such as form are distinct, insofar as they all lack the essential arising of form, and so on, they are not distinct. By understanding the lack of the essential arising of merely one phe­nomenon, one understands the lack of the essential arising of every phenomenon.542As we have seen, Tsongkhapa argues that since all phenomena are empty of any substance or essence, they are necessarily dependently arisen and rela­tional entities.543 Endorsing the claim that the ultimate nature of all phenom­ena is fundamentally the same does not, in his view, make one a monist. Tsongkhapa remains committed to a pluralistic view. “A pluralistic view of the world,” as Kalupahana puts it, “is not incompatible with dependent arising (pratityasamputpada). Pluralism in the context of dependent arising does not imply the existence of self-contradictory truths. It need not necessarily lead to a notion of an Absolute that transcends such self-contradictory truths.”544 Tsongkhapa maintains that the ultimate reality of, for instance, the table in front of ones eyes cannot be treated as simply identical with the ultimate reality pertaining to the chair that one is sitting on. The empty table can­not be equated with the empty chair, since the emptiness of the table is con­stitutive, not only of the empty table, but of the empty conceptual-linguistic conventions imposed upon it as well. Those conventions belong exclusively to the ultimate truth of the table and are not present in the chair. Tsong­khapa, however, does not regard this concession as an impediment to argu­ing for the universality of ultimate truth. Just as different objects occupy different spaces, and yet the space those objects occupy has the same nonob­structive characteristic, so the ultimate realities of both table and chair are different, notwithstanding that the two ultimate realities have identical natures— they share “the same taste.” Both of these emptinesses imply insubstantiality and lack of essence in the negative sense, as well as depend­ently arisen and relational nature in the affirmative sense."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT137It can therefore be said that, according to Tsongkhapa, an identical nature is universally shared by the ultimate realities of every empirical phe­nomenon. When the Buddha says that “the truth is one, there is no sec­ond,”545 Tsongkhapa infers a reference to the dependently arisen as the criterion of truth rather than to an absolute truth that transcends all forms of duality and plurality. He remarks that “whatever you (the Buddha) have spoken has reference to dependent arising. For this leads to nirvana. None of your actions fails to lead to peace.”546 He further argues that the Buddha has surpassed everyone in terms of his knowledge and teachings of depend­ent arising: “Among teachers the one who teaches dependent arising reigns supreme, and among knowledge the wisdom of dependent arising reigns supreme. These two are like the powerful monarchs ruling the world sys­tems.”547 Given that each dependently arisen phenomenon occupies a dif­ferent space and time, the universality of ultimate reality does not threaten Tsongkhapas pluralism.Gorampa takes the contrary approach by mobilizing the universality of ultimate reality to reinforce his monism. “Since its nature is one and the same like space,” he asserts, “it has no divisions.”548 Gorampa sees a clear incompatibility between a pluralistic account of ultimate reality and the commitment to its having a single uniform nature. Then again, his com­mitments to both a monistic ontology andi\\\\z universality of ultimate truth are seen to be compatible, and, indeed, as mutually reinforcing.Gorampa regards the ultimate reality of the table as wholly equivalent to that of all other phenomena. There is no difference at all between the ulti­mate reality of the table and that of the chair—or of anything else for that matter. Just as space is the same for all the different objects that occupy it (it is, one might say, the objects that differ, and not the space), so it is one and the same ultimate reality that universally underlies all empirical phe­nomena. The universality of ultimate truth could not, from Gorampas per­spective, be maintained if the same ultimate reality were not shared by all empirical phenomena. If there were an ultimate truth that pertained to each phenomenon individually, then so would the ultimate truths of those phe­nomena, like the phenomena themselves, be confined within the bounds of those phenomena. There would then be no universal ultimate truth, no universally applicable characteristics. Any pluralistic account of ultimate reality is thus seen by Gorampa as contradictory to the notion of the uni­versality of ultimate reality.We will now address the epistemological aspect of the universality of ulti­mate truth. Since ontology and epistemology are typically interdependent,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"i38THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthe two ontological positions discussed above provide the basis for the two epistemological positions. For Tsongkhapa, the inseparable ontological unity between the two truths means that knowledge of one necessarily entails knowledge of the other. A fully enlightened being “perfectly knows the universality of [ultimate truths] within a single moment of wisdom.”549In Gorampas view, an enlightened wisdom accessing the universality of ultimate truth operates entirely independently of any empirical truths. Thus he holds that an enlightened wisdom must necessarily sever all epis­temic connections with empirical knowledge. “When the universality of ultimate truth of all phenomena is understood as dharmadhatu,” he says, “a single event of wisdom knows this within a single moment. This is fol­lowed by the disappearance of distinctions between ultimate reality, empir­ical reality, and apprehending wisdom.”330 Consequently these latter three form a nondual, absolute, and independent transcendent wisdom wherein all dualities fuse. As such the knowing wisdom and the object known liter­ally become one.For an arya who is yet to be fully enlightened, the wisdom of the univer­sality of ultimate truth arises only during the meditative equipoise and not during the postmeditative equipoise. For a fully enlightened being, there is no postmeditative equipoise—such a being, as Gorampa holds it, remains eternally absorbed with the universality of ultimate truth. As he sees it, this is the highest cognitive virtue of an enlightened being.551 It is crucial to note that for Gorampa knowing the universality of ultimate truth is not a mat­ter of engaging with it. On attainment of full enlightenment, the duality between subject and object totally disappears. The interaction between what is to be known and the knower comes to an end. The knower— tran­scendent wisdom—alone survives. In Gorampas view, this is the way an enlightened being directly and personally knows the universality of ulti­mate reality without any duality. In more explicit terms, knowing the uni­versality of ultimate truth means to become one with the unconditioned and transcendent ultimate truth. The knower becomes timeless, neither arising nor ceasing.552If it is true that an enlightened being knows all objects of knowledge within a single instant, as both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa claim, the question then arises: How is this possible? To arrive at an answer, we will first explore why other sentient beings (particularly the three types of aryas, namely, arya srdvakas, aryapratyekabuddhas, and arya bodhisattvas) do not know all objects of knowledge within a single instant, and then revisit the analysis of an enlightened being’s superior ways of knowing. Like Tsongkhapa, Gorampa551"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT139acknowledges the value of exploring the ways an nonenlightened arya knows the two truths. A precise evaluation of the cognitive framework within which nonenlightened beings operate is seen as pedagogically useful for the analysis of the enlightened cognition.How an Arya Knows the Two TruthsConsistent with the standard Madhyamaka position, both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa maintain that, with the sole exception of buddhas, all beings, including arya s'ravakas, arya pratyekabuddhas, and arya bodhisattvas of the tenth level (bhumi) and below, are subject to varying degrees of misconcep­tion regarding the two truths. Ordinary beings are predominantly influ­enced by reifying ignorance and afflictive defilements. These cognitive agents superimpose absolute characteristics, such as essences, substantiality, or permanence, on to impermanent and insubstantial things, processes, or events. However, arya bodhisattvas (on the eighth bhumi and below) are free from active reifying tendencies and afflictive defilements. They have directly experienced ultimate truth, and so they have eradicated all negative emotions, including deluded ignorance, but they are still under the influ­ence of latent defilements. Due to the continued and sustained orientation toward ultimate truth that is directly and personally realized in meditative equipoise, arya sravakas, arya pratyekabuddhas, and the arya bodhisattvas of the eighth to tenth bhumis are, however, totally free of even the subtlest latent reifying tendencies.554 Yet these three types of aryas are still subject to what is called nondeluded ignorance—the conditioned state of mind predis­posed by the previously existent latent conception of essence (bden dzin gyi bags chags). Thus, although these three types of aryas—s'ravakas, pratyek­abuddhas, and bodhisattvas of the eighth to tenth bhumis— no longer have even the latent reifying psychological tendencies, they are yet to be fully enlightened, and they still have very subtle cognitive limitations. They remain predisposed to the assumption of dualities (rather than the reifi­cation of dualities) that was deeply habituated by the previously existent latent reifying tendencies. Often the subtle misconceptions possessed by them are described as “predisposed misconceptions of dualistic appearance” (gnyis snang 'phrul ba’i bag chags).555To this point both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa are in agreement. But what constitutes the “misconception of dualistic appearance”? And how should it be defined? To begin with, both Tibetan Madhyamikas pinpoint"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthe misconception of dualistic appearance as a very subtle tension between the mode of phenomenal existence and how that existence is understood— it involves a minimal conflict between ontological status and the correspon­ding epistemic state. However, on closer observation, it becomes evident that Tsongkhapa and Gorampa offer strikingly different accounts of what is at issue here: Tsongkhapas ontology of ultimate truth has to accommo­date the status of conventional truth, and consequently his nondual episte- mology must encompass the understanding of conventional truth as well; Gorampas ontology of ultimate truth necessarily excludes the status of con­ventional truth, and consequently his nondual epistemology must exclude the understanding of conventional truth.This dualistic appearance, as Tsongkhapa understands it, is a subtle mis­conception that pertains to the nature of both truths. It is described as “dualistic appearance” because of the persisting subtle conflict between the ontological status of ultimate truth and its concurrent epistemic status due to the presence of the subtle epistemic error. The solution lies, therefore, in eliminating the epistemic error. A mere dichotomy between the subject and the object, in Tsongkhapas view, is not part of the problem. In fact, the mere dichotomy between subject and object is, as he understands it, inevitable for even the most evolved wisdom. No knowledge whatsoever is possible without the interaction between cognition and cognitive field. In the Dvaytanupassana Sutta, the Buddha also points out that dualities in them­selves are not problems, provided they are understood properly:Monks, if there are any who ask, “Your listening to teachings that are skillful, noble, leading onward, going to self-awakening is a prerequisite for what?” they should be told, “For the sake of knowing qualities of dualities as they actually are.” “What dual­ity are you talking about?” “This is dukkha. This is the origina­tion ofdukkha”: this is one contemplation. “This is the cessation of dukkha. This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha”: this is the second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, and resolute—one of the two fruits can be expected: either gno­sis right here and now, or— if there be any remnant of clinging- sustenance—non-return...Now, if there are any who ask, “Would there be the right con­templation of dualities in yet another way?” they should be told, “There would.” “How would that be?” “Whatever dukkha"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENTcomes into play is ail from ignorance as a requisite condition”: this is one contemplation. “From the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance, there is no coming into play of dukkha”: this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way—heedful, ardent, and resolute—one of the two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here and now, or— if there be any remnant of clinging- sustenance—non-return.556Like Tsongkhapa, Gorampas account of dualistic appearance also refers to a conflict between the ontological status of ultimate truth and the concur­rent epistemic state. Gorampa differs, however, in viewing the conflict as between the ultimate subject and the ultimate object. From his perspective, the subject-object dichotomy is at the heart of the problem, and the only solution is to eschew the objective element in order to embrace a meta­physical nonduality—so long as the interaction between the apprehending consciousness and apprehended object is maintained, so also is the miscon­ception of the subtle dualistic appearance perpetuated.Having explained dualistic appearance, the next question is: What harm does this duality actually cause? What is wrong with maintaining this sub­tle dualistic appearance? Both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa argue that it is the presence of the misconception of dualistic appearance that prevents the three types of aryas from accomplishing the simultaneous realization of the universality of ultimate reality; in the presence of such misconception, con­ventional truths and ultimate truth can only be known sequentially.Gorampa maintains the three types of aryas perceive empirical truths in their postmeditation entirely because of the misconception of dualistic appearance. “Because they have not yet eradicated the predisposition of dualistic appearance,” Gorampa asserts, “their subsequently attained wis­dom (rjes thobye shes, prstha labdha jndna) perceives the plurality of charac­terized objects (chos can, dharmin) associated with arising and cessation.”557 As long as the perception of characterized objects with the characteristics of arising and cessation persists, it is not possible for the three types of aryas to engage with the universality of ultimate reality. The plurality that these aryas experience during postmeditation thus prevents them, according to Gorampa, from accessing ultimate reality; the wisdom of the meditative equipoise, on the other hand, immediately presents them with that reality: “During meditative equipoise, they realize ultimate reality; hence neither arising nor cessation is perceived.”558The alternation between the knowledge"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"142THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof conventionalities and ultimate reality, as Gorampa sees it, “is an indica­tion that these aryas have yet to accomplish the perfection of knowing the universality of all phenomena in terms of their dharmadhatu.”559Tsongkhapas take is very different. It is worth recalling here Tsongkhapas emphatic distinction between ultimately valid cognition— transcendent wisdom, nonconceptual wisdom—and empirically valid cognition. Cer­tainly it is true, according to him, that when the three types of aryas directly and personally know ultimate truth by means of ultimately valid cogni­tion, they do not concurrently know conventional truth; and the converse also applies. Hence Tsongkhapa argues that “so long as buddhahood is not attained, it is not possible for a single cognition simultaneously to perceive characterized phenomena each individually while at the same directly cog­nizing ultimate reality within a single temporal instant.” Instead, “these two kinds of knowledge come about sequentially.”560 This does not mean, how­ever, that, in the direct knowledge of ultimate truth, the ultimately valid cog­nition of the three aryas operates independently of its empirical counterpart; neither is it suggested that for such aryas empirically valid cognition oper­ates independently of ultimate valid cognition. Realizing the two truths, either alternately or simultaneously, always requires mutual support between the two valid cognitions. Tsongkhapa regards this mutual collaboration as an essential condition for any coherent knowledge. Without such coordina­tion, realization of neither ultimate truth nor conventional truth is possible. This mutual support in itself does not require that the cognitive agent con­cerned has simultaneous knowledge of both truths. Even sequential knowl­edge of the two truths by these aryas demands mutual support between the two cognitive resources. Indeed, any knowledge of the two truths, whether sequential or simultaneous, depends on the same epistemic conditions.Tsongkhapa posits two approaches to the question of how, and in what ways, the subtle misconception of duality limits the knowledge of the three aryas. It can be approached from either meditative equipoise (the ultimate standpoint) or postmeditation (the empirical standpoint). From the former standpoint, the issue is how the subtle misconception of duality restricts the scope of these aryas’ knowledge of all phenomena as empty. From the lat­ter standpoint, the issue is how such misconception impedes these aryas’ knowledge of all phenomena as dependently arisen.Approaching it from the standpoint of meditative equipoise, Tsongkhapa maintains that while the aryas dwell in the meditative state, they have direct knowledge of ultimate truth, and consequently they know that all phenom­ena are empty. Because of the limits imposed by the subtle misconception"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT143of duality, however, they still do not have direct knowledge of the empti­ness of emptiness itself. To know emptiness itself as empty, these aryas have to know directly all empty phenomena as equivalent to dependently arisen phenomena from the ultimate standpoint. This insight requires the most profound understanding of how nonconceptual knowledge of phenomena as empty is equivalent to conceptual knowledge of phenomena as depend­ently arisen. This depends on simultaneous knowledge of the two truths. However, as long as aryas knowledge is circumscribed by the subtle mis­conception of duality due to previously existent mental predispositions, simultaneous knowledge of the two truths is not possible. Since these aryas still have tendencies toward the dichotomization of the two truths, they also retain those tendencies toward empty and dependently arisen phenomena.Approaching from the postmeditation standpoint, Tsongkhapa main­tains that when the three types of aryas are engaging in practical activities in postmeditation, they directly know conventional truth, hence aryas know that all phenomena are dependently arisen. However, because of the limits imposed by the subtle misconception of duality, they still do not see the dependently arisen nature of dependent arising itself. The latter knowl­edge requires direct understanding of how dependently arisen phenomena are empty from the conventional standpoint, without relying on inference. This in turn requires the most profound understanding of how the concep­tual knowledge of phenomena as dependently arisen is equivalent to the nonconceptual knowledge of all phenomena as empty. In other words, aryas have to know the compatibility between the ultimate and the conventional views of Madhyamaka. Again, as in the first approach, this understanding depends on the simultaneous knowledge of the two truths. But because aryas of the three kinds are not yet free from the tendency to dichotomize the two truths, and therefore to dichotomize empty and dependently arisen phenomena, simultaneous knowledge is not yet possible for them.Based on these arguments, Tsongkhapa maintains that aryas of the three kinds have only alternating knowledge of the two truths. Either they directly know conventional truth in the postmeditation, or they directly know ultimate truth in the meditative equipoise. These three types of aryas could not have concurrent knowledge of both the truths, and therefore could not have concurrent knowledge of empty and dependently arisen phenomena, and thus the scope of knowledge of the three types of aryas is limited. Only perfectly enlightened beings are held capable of having direct knowledge of both truths simultaneously, and hence capable of knowing empty and dependently arisen phenomena concurrently."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"14 4THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEIn short, both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa agree that all aryas, except arya buddhas, are incapable of knowing the universality of ultimate truth within a single cognitive event. They also agree that it is due to the influence of the subtle misconception of duality that aryas of the three kinds do not have an exhaustive knowledge of all knowable objects. The two Tibetans neverthe­less disagree inasmuch as Gorampa insists that the subtle misconception of duality causes aryas to mistakenly perceive empirical truths in postmedita­tion, while Tsongkhapa insists the subtle misconception prevents the aryas from knowing the two truths simultaneously.A Buddhas Exceptional Mode of Knowing the Two TruthsOur focus in the next two sections will be on the exceptional cognitive scope of the fully enlightened being who, according to both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa, is free from even the subtle misconception of duality. Given that their treatments of this topic are distinct, we will discuss them separately. We will start with Gorampas treatment.Knowing the Two Truths from the Two Conflicting PerspectivesFor Gorampa the subtle misconception of dual appearance is, as argued ear­lier, none other than the conception of the duality of subject and object. This duality is the subtlest object of negation, also called the “subtlest obstruction of knowledge ” (shes bya’i sgrib pa phra mo),%x The fact that an arya experiences empirical truths as objects of knowledge during postmed­itation, and cannot embrace the universality of ultimate truth in all circum­stances, is, argues Gorampa, due entirely to this misconceived dichotomy. Enlightenment therefore culminates with eradication of the subject-object dichotomy. Enlightenment means absolute nondual wisdom. This wisdom, as Gorampa would have it, is metaphysically transcendent, free from any empirical basis.In Gorampas epistemology, enlightened wisdom involves two distinct ways of knowing—knowing things from an enlightened perspective and know­ing things from the nonenlightened, others perspective. The chief feature of enlightened knowledge is its capacity to cognize the universality of ultimate truth. Eradicating the subject-object dichotomy, in Gorampas view, is the only possible way to eschew empirical truth and the empirically valid con­sciousness that verifies it. Hence Gorampa asserts that “conventional truths"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT145enunciated in those contexts [e.g., in the texts of Nagarjuna and Candraklrti] are nonexistent [from an enlightened consciousness]. Since there is no erroneous apprehending subject, its corresponding object — [conventional truth]—does not exist.”562 The “erroneous apprehending subject” in this context refers to all empirically valid consciousnesses. The empirically valid consciousness verifying empirical truths is, he maintains, representative of the ignorant cognitive activities that involve the subject- object dichotomy. Since an enlightened person is free from ignorance, so the empirically valid consciousness is also absent. Thus empirical truths projected by ignorance and verified by the empirically valid consciousness are not verified by an enlightened wisdom:Despite the fact that [a buddha] does not perceive appearance of the conventional categories—arising, cessation, and so on— explained to the disciples, [a buddha] does perceive the appear­ance of the nondifferentiated being (dbyings) of the ultimate reality...Even then, there is no appearance that leads to duality in perception, for even the slightest fallacious inclinations [of committing to duality] have already been eliminated....In short, the eight entities, including arising, cessation, and so on, discussed in the preamble of the MulamadhyamakakarikadiTz all conceptual elaborations; so are the twenty-seven analyzable factors—from the conditions up to views—examined through­out the twenty-seven chapters, and the entire conventional sys­tem, including all empirical entities. In the buddharealm, they are realized by an enlightened being within a single instant of enlightened wisdom. Although those conceptual elaborations remain unseen, there is no contradiction in saying that they are perceived as dharmadhatu, inalienably fused with the universal­ity of ultimate truth.563Jayananda,564 Rendawa,565 Shakya Chogden,566 Taktsang Lotsawa,567 Kun- khyen Pema Karpo, Karmapa Mikyo Dorje,568 Mipham Rinpoche,569 Gen­dlin Chopel570—all are proponents of Gorampas view that enlightenment is transcendent of empirical experiences. For example, Pema Karpo writes:To the extent the remaining obstructions exist, to that extent mul­tifaceted appearances are perceived as illusory, etc., during the postmeditative state. However, from the moment all latencies [of"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"146THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEpreviously existent defilements] are exhaustively [eliminated], conventional phenomena are eternally not perceived. Instead one eternally dwells on the essence of the meditative equipoise.571Gorampas account of enlightened wisdom— metaphysically absolute, non­dual, and transcendent—arises from his efforts to graft the dlayavijndna, the foundation consciousness572 of Yogacara idealism, onto the Prasangika Madhyamaka system. “The Prasangika Madhyamaka,” he claims, “must accept the empirical existence of the alayavijnana, since it is revealed in the Bhagavan’s discourses. Acarya [Candraklrti] also says that it is an empiri­cal truth573 and a vehicle to understand ultimate truth.”574 Alayavijnana is a “sheer luminous consciousness. Though it is not totally distinct from the six aggregates,” according to Gorampa, “it endures uninterruptedly through to the level of buddhahood right from the [ordinary state of] sen­tient beings.”575 The enlightened wisdom is recovered, then, from the foun­dational consciousness that is already existent in each and every being. It is this wisdom that alone exists after the total elimination of the empirical sys­tem, and it exists unconditionally and nonrelationally: “The process of aris­ing and cessation is not perceived, hence it is neither a conditioned nor an impermanent phenomenon.”576Elsewhere Gorampa argues that “because every conditioned phenome­non is momentary, it arises and ceases. Hence both [arising and cessation] are untenable [as features of enlightened wisdom].”577 He continues: “Whatever is conditioned would inevitably bear false and deceptive char­acteristics. And, so long as the perception of arising and cessation exists, the meaning of dependently arisen would not be one of nonarising.”578 And as Gendiin Chopel puts it: “To the extent the appearance of conventionalities are not ceased, and to the extent the referent of consciousness is not done away with, to that extent, despite having had a direct knowledge of empti­ness, one is forced to accept ones earlier [essentialist] views.”579Furthermore, Gorampa contends, while “impermanent, conditioned, false, and deceptive phenomena are experienced by aryas in lower levels of the noble path, they must be nonexistent for an enlightened wisdom.”580 Phenomena are nonexistent not only in the ultimate sense but also in the empirical sense at this point. “The ultimate nonexistence of [conditioned] phenomena is also experienced even by aryas in the lower scale of the noble path,” therefore it does not demonstrate any exceptional cognitive qualities on the part of an enlightened person.581 But the nonexistence of imperma­nent, conditioned, false, and deceptive phenomena from the empirical"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENTH7standpoint does indeed demonstrate the exceptional qualities of enlight­ened wisdom.To reinforce the nondual character of enlightened wisdom, Gorampa argues for nondifferentiated integration between wisdom and ultimate truth. Here he uses two slightly different approaches: first, he argues that, with the attainment of buddhahood, consciousness itself is transformed into the ultimate truth. “Having realized emptiness, and having it thor­oughly familiarized, all adventitious stains are eradicated,” he states, adding that “mind itself is transformed into the uncontaminated sphere (zag med kyi dbyings). This is the ultimate buddha, an embodiment of the virtues of the abandonment [of wrong views] and the realization [of ultimate truth].”582 Secondly, he explicitly delineates the fusion between enlightened wisdom and ultimate truth:Having burnt all the fuels of the conceptual elaborations— the objects of knowledge such as arising and cessation, permanence and annihilation— through the vajra-like meditative stabiliza­tion, dharmadhatu, free from all conceptual elaborations, sustains.So, too, the continuum of the previously existent consciousness becomes free from conceptual elaborations, such as arising and cessation. The [enlightened] wisdom is thus formed by the insep­arable nature.583In the Mahdratnakuta Sutra Manjus'rl takes a very similar, if not identical, position to Gorampa regarding the identity of dharmadhatu and bodhi. Sariputra asks Manjus'ri: “Does the Buddha not realize supreme enlighten­ment through the dharmadhatu?” The latter replies: “No, Sariputra. Why? Because the World-Honored One is the dharmadhatu itself. It is absurd to say that the dharmadhatu realizes the dharmadhatu. Sariputra,” he contin­ues, “the nature of the dharmadhatu is bodhi. Why? Because in the dhar­madhatu, there is no trace of sentient beings and all dharmas are empty. The emptiness of all dharmas is bodhi, because they are not two and are not dif­ferent.”584 Consider also the implications of this dialogue, where the Bud­dha asks Manjusri: “You call me the Tathagata. Do you really think that I am the Tathagata?” Manjus'ri answers: “No World-Honored One, I do not think you are the Tathagata. There is nothing about suchness that distin­guishes it as suchness, nor is there a Tathagata’s wisdom capable of know­ing suchness.” Manjus'ri goes on to explain: “Because the Tathagata and wisdom are not two. Emptiness is the Tathagata; therefore the Tathagata is"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"148THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEonly an arbitrary name. How, then, can I regard anyone as the Tatha­gata?”585 While the first quote emphasizes the identity of bodhi and dhar­madhatu and the latter Tathagata and wisdom, the point is clear. For Gorampa, this means that an ultimate truth, as a knowable, and an enlight­ened consciousness, as a knowing subject, are identical.Gorampa, however, takes this identity even further. In defending his idea of the nondifferentiated character of enlightened wisdom and ultimate real­ity, he even dismisses the existence of the mind and mental factors that might otherwise be thought to persist in an enlightened person. So long as “mind and the mental factors exist, the subject-object duality is inevitable... Thus would exist differentiation on the basis of the perception of objects ....”586 However, “once a nondifferentiated consciousness—which is free from all conceptual elaborations, the objects of knowledge, such as arising and cessation— is attained there is not the slightest dualistic appearance. Not even different modes of perception exist.”587 Since nonduality is seen as the chief qualification of enlightened knowledge, so “the slightest involve­ment of duality, even in the case of enlightenment, denies ultimate truth.”588This absolute nondualistic account gives rise to several pertinent ques­tions. If it is true that an enlightened wisdom does not see anything from its own perspective, how could an enlightened being interact with others, with his followers, for example? How could a buddha determine what dis­course is beneficial and appropriate for others if he does not see others? In response to these questions, Gorampa introduces what he calls knowing from the others perspective (gzhan ngor shes pa). Although Gorampa claims that an enlightened being does not experience anything empirical from an enlightened perspective, such a being nonetheless recognizes and identi­fies empirical phenomena and interacts with other people from the others perspective. For example, when the Buddha sees one of his disciples, say Sariputra, he sees and interacts with Sariputra from the disciples own per­spective. Likewise, when the Buddha sees phenomenal objects and engages with them, he does this from his disciples’ points of view. Therefore knowl­edge from the other’s perspective, although it is the secondary form of knowledge of an enlightened being, is not part of the cognitive operation of enlightened wisdom.Thus Gorampa maintains that knowledge from the enlightened per­spective and knowledge from the other’s perspective are contradictory and mutually exclusive. From an enlightened perspective, as he argued earlier, a buddha experiences nothing whatsoever, neither ultimately nor empiri­cally. Gorampa, in fact, dismisses the distinction between the empirical"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT149and ultimate standpoints at the level of buddhahood: “The empirical standpoint is accepted merely from the others perspective. The distinction between the empirical and ultimate standpoints does not apply to the enlightened perspective.”589Gendiin Chopel illustrates the concept of other’s perspective by using a metaphor:When a magician conjures up an illusory elephant, the audience sees it as a real elephant. The magician plays his tricks in order to see something non-elephant as if it is a real elephant. Now, when the audience asks the magician: “is this a real elephant?” [The magician] replies “yes.” In this case, the magician accepts the ele­phant from the other’s perspective.590Thus the world of empirical truths, reified by ignorance, is spontaneously experienced by an enlightened person from the other’s perspective. Gorampa thus claims that “both ultimate arising and empirical arising exist [for an enlightened person] from the other’s perspective. That which is said to be nonarising is with reference to a buddha’s own perspective. From this perspective neither ultimate arising nor empirical arising exists.”591 It is worth reflecting on the key phrase he uses here—when a buddha engages with the world from the other’s perspective, then he, like naive ordinary beings, is said to reify not only empirical arising but also ultimate arising. So in this context even an enlightened being is an essentialist or a reifi- cationist, like ordinary beings. Gorampa certainly posits that “from a bud­dha’s own perspective, since arising and cessation are not perceived, there are neither conditioned nor impermanent phenomena.” However, he also argues that “from the other’s perspective, the perspective of his disciples, [an enlightened being experiences] arising and cessation, since arising and ces­sation of virtues exist.”592 Although Gorampa insists that enlightened be­ings experience arising and cessation from the other’s perspective, “it does not follow that an enlightened wisdom is itself characterized by arising and cessation. It simply shows how they appear to the minds of disciples.”593 An enlightened person, as mentioned earlier, “perceives arising and cessation from the other’s perspective (gzhan snang), but certainly not from his own perspective (rang snang).”594Supporters of Gorampas doctrine of other’s perspective include Mipham Rinpoche,595 Taktsang Lotsawa,596 and Karmapa Mikyo Dorje.597They also advocate that the exceptional quality of enlightened knowledge consists in"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"150THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEnot experiencing anything empirical from the enlightened perspective, but experiencing everything from the others—nonenlightened—perspective.What stands out as the essential feature of knowledge from the others perspective is that it is, in every sense, equivalent to the knowledge of ordi­nary beings. Just as an ordinary person reifies essence, claims Gorampa, so too does an enlightened being. Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen, who is otherwise one of Gorampas traditional allies, ridicules the doctrine of the other s per­spective. To claim that the attaining of enlightenment requires knowledge from the perspective of ordinary beings is, according to Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen, tantamount to claiming that ordinary beings are accomplished enlightened beings, and that enlightened beings are ordinary beings. With­out expending any effort, ordinary beings are born with the ordinary per­spectives, and they should therefore be inherently possessed with enlightened knowledge.598Knowing the Two Truths SimultaneouslyTsongkhapa is in accord with Gorampa that the attainment of buddhahood culminates with total eradication of the subtle object of negation—the mis­conception of duality. Among the numerous exceptional qualities of an enlightened person, Tsongkhapa singles out the cognitive ability to have direct and simultaneous realization of the two truths within a single instant. In his view, the coordination between a buddhas ultimately and empirically valid cognition is absolutely essential to achieve this simultaneity. Without this coordination, he argues, it is not possible for an enlightened person to realize either of the two truths. The ultimately valid consciousness of an enlightened person is not capable of realizing ultimate truth in the absence of empirically valid cognition; similarly, empirically valid consciousness is not capable of realizing conventional truth in the absence of ultimately valid consciousness.599Thus the two valid cognitive resources of an enlightened person are always mutually entailing. Not only they do not function independently of each other, but they no longer know the two truths alternately, as do other aryas. “When every misconception is eradicated without a trace,” Tsong­khapa explains, “each individual moment of every single enlightened con­sciousness (ye shes) embodies an interplay of dual consciousness that arises uninterruptedly with the identical characteristics.”600 By knowing empiri­cal truth, then, an enlightened being knows ultimate truth, and by know­ing ultimate truth, a buddha also knows empirical truth. In this way an"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENTenlightened being knows the two objects of knowledge simultaneously within a single moment of wisdom. This is possible here because the ulti­mately valid consciousness and the empirically valid consciousness of a buddha perform their functions in a way that makes them inseparable. The uncritical cognitive engagement of every single empirically valid conscious­ness of an enlightened person is accompanied by the critical cognitive engagement of every single ultimately valid consciousness of a buddha and vice versa. Recognizing these mutually inclusive cognitive resources of a buddha, Tsongkhapa argues that every single moment of enlightened con­sciousness knows both truths directly.From a slightly different perspective, it can also be said that the previ­ously alternating engagements between meditative equipoise and subse­quent attainment601 now, with true enlightenment, achieve a perfect equilibrium. Previously, the wisdom of meditative equipoise was directed more toward ultimate truth, while the wisdom of the subsequent attain­ment, or postmeditation, was directed more toward empirical truth. The knowledge of the two truths was thereby somehow isolated, not integrated. However, with the attainment of buddhahood, the cognitive capacity to engage with ultimate truth and that of engaging with conventional truth become simultaneous. Tsongkhapa argues: “Once the predisposition of the conception of true existence is thoroughly eradicated, one attains buddha­hood. Thereafter,” he explains, “[a buddha] continuously abides in the meditative equipoise, directly realizing ultimate truth. Thereafter the alter­nate [realization]— i.e., not abiding in meditative equipoise in subsequent attainment—no longer applies.”602 In other words, whether a buddha appears to be in meditative equipoise or engaged in other activities, the mind of an enlightened being does not deviate from direct knowledge of the two truths. Tsongkhapa therefore claims that there is no qualitative dis­tinction whatsoever between a buddhas wisdom of meditative equipoise and his wisdom of subsequent attainment, or postmeditation:Because there is no wisdom of subsequent attainment realizing phenomenal objects that is qualitatively distinct from the wis­dom of meditative equipoise, it should be accepted that a single moment of wisdom knows all objects of knowledge comprising the two truths.603With the end of the alternating realization of two truths,604 the usual qual­itative distinction between the cognitive status of meditative equipoise and"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"152THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthat of postmeditation no longer applies. Every enlightened cognitive activ­ity is a correct knowledge of ultimate truth.Tsongkhapas claim gives rise to a couple of questions: If every moment of enlightened consciousness knows both truths directly, is a buddhas empirically valid cognition able to cognize ultimate truth independently of his ultimately valid cognition? Similarly, is a buddhas ultimately valid cog­nition able to cognize conventional truth independently from his empiri­cally valid cognition?In response to the first question, Tsongkhapa argues that the empirically valid consciousness of a buddha does not know ultimate truth independ­ently from ultimately valid consciousness, and that this is so for two rea­sons. First, an affirmative answer would render the cognitive role of a buddhas ultimately valid consciousness redundant, and thus contradict Tsongkhapas view that designates the verification of ultimate truth as the function of ultimately valid consciousness. Second, if this were so, it would threaten the internal consistency of Tsongkhapas definitions of ultimate truth, since he has previously defined ultimate truth in relation to the cog­nitive function of ultimately valid consciousness. In response to the second question, Tsongkhapa says that it is not possible for the ultimately valid consciousness of a buddha to know conventional truth independently of empirically valid consciousness, and that again this is so for two reasons analogous to those just cited. First, if this were possible, it would render the cognitive role of a buddhas empirically valid consciousness redundant, again contradicting Tsongkhapa that the function of verifying empirical truths belongs to empirically valid consciousness. Second, if this were so, it would threaten the internal consistency of Tsongkhapas own definitions of conventional truth, since he defines conventional truth in relation to the function of empirically valid consciousness. Tsongkhapa claims, therefore, that the two valid consciousnesses of an enlightened being do not involve knowledge of ultimate truth independently of one another.Tsongkhapa denies that this poses any contraction—insofar as both wis­doms are invariably valid representations of ultimate truth, the wisdom of the meditative equipoise and of postmeditation are both accepted as qual­itatively identical (ngo bo gcig). According to him, this identity does not make either wisdom redundant or threaten the internal consistency of the definitions of the two truths. While qualitatively identical, the two wisdoms are also distinct in terms of their mode of cognitive activity:Because fan object] is found by the wisdom knowing truths as theytruly are (je lta ba mkhyen pa’i ye shes)y it is a wisdom knowing"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT153truths as they truly are (je lta ba) with respect to that object. And because [an object] is found by wisdom knowing phenomenal objects (je snyadpa mkhyenpaiye shes), it is a wisdom knowing phenomenal objects (je snyed pa) with respect to that object. Therefore an enlightened mode of knowing ultimate and con­ventional truths should be understood with reference to the indi­vidual objects (yul so so la Itos nas).605Although the ultimately valid consciousness of an enlightened being is a coherent representation of conventional truth, still, according to Tsong­khapas view, conventional truth perse is not found or verified by such con­sciousness. Rather, the function of such consciousness is to critically verify the ultimate truth of the empirically given phenomena that is found by empirically valid consciousness. Because of its critical cognitive function, the ultimately valid consciousness of a buddha cannot provide a holistic view of the world. But a holistic view is essential to establish the validity of conventional truth. In the light of its critical function, the ultimately valid consciousness of an enlightened being is consistently described as the “wisdom that knows phenomena as they truly are” (ji lta ba bzhin du mkhyenpaiye shes, yathabhutajnana). Likewise, although the empirically valid consciousness of an enlightened being is a coherent representation of ultimate truth, ultimate truth per se is not found or verified by such con­sciousness. Instead, the function of such consciousness is to verify conven­tional truth. Because of its uncritical cognitive function, the empirically valid consciousness of a buddha consistently represents its corresponding objects holistically. It is therefore always described as the wisdom that real­izes “the plurality of phenomenal objects” (ji snyed pa mkhyen paiye shes, yavdtajndna). Understanding that the two different types of cognition, in Tsongkhapas view, “have different spheres of authority,” Pettit notes that “consciousness that investigates conventional phenomena (tha snyaddpyod pa'i tshad ma) is not authoritative for determining the ultimate status of phenomena, nor is an analysis of the ultimate status of phenomena (don dam dpyodpa7i tshad ma) authoritative for their conventional status.”606 This is like saying that an ear consciousness is not authoritative for visual objects. The sphere of authority for each consciousness derives from its function, and therefore its authority should not be viewed as absolutely inherent and independent of the others.It is quite apparent that even the “exceptional way of knowing the two truths by a buddha” does not, according to Tsongkhapa, contradict the definitions of the two truths. Neither does it make the cognitive functions"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"154THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEof the two valid consciousnesses of an enlightened person redundant. The empirically valid consciousness of an enlightened person uncritically veri­fies empirical truths, while ultimately valid consciousness critically verifies the ultimate mode of empirical truths. But because the two cognitive resources are inextricably interwoven, every enlightened consciousness is a culmination of the two wisdoms. Every event of enlightened conscious­ness coherently represents things as they truly are. This is how, in Tsong­khapas view, even the most enlightened wisdom operates within the framework of the definitions of the two truths, while nevertheless achiev­ing the realization of both truths simultaneously. In so doing, it avoids all contradictions. “Such is the exceptional qualities of a bhagavan, a bud­dha,”607 says Tsongkhapa:With the reference to dharmata, it is a wisdom knowing things as they are. Here, every dual appearance dissolves from the van­tage point of that cognition. Thus this wisdom, just like pouring water into water, embraces universality (ro grig). However, with respect to the phenomenal objects, it is a wisdom knowing empirical truths. At this point, though the dualistic appearances perceiving distinct subject and object are involved, they are unmistaken dualistic appearances. Since the predisposition of the misconception pertaining to dualistic appearance is uprooted without trace, dualistic appearances no longer misconceive the perceived object.608In Tsongkhapas view, then, an enlightened being has two ways of knowing ultimate truth. One is to realize it during the meditative equipoise by tran­scending all dualities, described as knowing space-like emptiness (nam mkha Ita bui stong nyid).m As the Buddha explains:Monks, that sphere should be realized where the eye (vision) stops and the perception (mental noting) of form fades. That sphere is to be realized where the ear stops and the perception of sound fades.. .where the nose stops and the perception of aroma fades...where the tongue stops and the perception of flavor fades.. .where the body stops and the perception of tactile sensa­tions fades.. .where the intellect stops and the perception of ideas fades: That sphere should be realized.610"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT155For Tsongkhapa this sphere of nondifferentiated, space-like experience does not in any way represent a metaphysical transcendence. The experience of such nature is entirely possible within the meditator s own body. This tran­scendent state can be directly and personally experienced, but it cannot be intellectually known or linguistically described from the outside, and nei­ther can an enlightened person, even when actually experiencing it, offer any criterion to describe it. The Buddha articulates this point:There is, monks, that sphere where there is neither earth nor water, nor fire, nor wind, nor sphere of the infinitude of space, nor sphere of the infinitude of consciousness, nor sphere of nothingness, nor sphere of neither perception nor nonpercep­tion, nor this world, nor the next world, nor sun, nor moon. And there, I say, there is neither coming, nor going, nor stasis, nor passing away, nor arising: without stance, without foundation, without support (mental object). This, just this, is the end of dukkha [Ud 8.1].611The other way of knowing ultimate truth is during the subsequent attain­ment in the wake of meditative equipoise. Tsongkhapa describes this way of realizing ultimate truth as knowing illusion-like emptiness (sgyu ma lta bui stongnyid).612 In this mode of knowing, argues Tsongkhapa, phenomena are perceived as relational, interdependent, and illusory. Although the duality between subject and object is involved, it is thoroughly compatible with the nondual enlightened knowledge.613 The Buddha explains, in the Paccaya Sutta, why knowing phenomena as dependently arisen does not constitute a misconceived duality:When a disciple of the noble one has seen well with right discern­ment this dependent co-arising and these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present, it is not possible that he would run after the past, thinking, “Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Hav­ing been what, what was I in the past?” or that he would run after the future, thinking, “Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?” or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present,"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"156THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEthinking, “Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?” Such a thing is not possible. Why is that? Because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with discernment this dependent co-arising and these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present.614Since the duality between subject and object in this context is totally free from any misconception, the mere presence of duality is not a problem. It is, in fact, an inevitable ground for coherent knowledge. “Once this point is understood,” says Tsongkhapa, “one can correctly understand how the meditation on the space-like emptiness during the meditative equipoise reinforces the understanding of illusion-like emptiness in the subsequent attainment.”615 The validity of knowing the illusion-like emptiness—con­ventional truth—and the validity of knowing the space-like emptiness— ultimate truth—are therefore compatible in every respect.616 By knowing phenomena as conventionally illusory, a buddha knows that phenomena are ultimately empty; by knowing phenomena as ultimately empty a bud­dha knows that phenomena are conventionally illusory. Hence, in Tsong­khapas view, “there is no contradiction in saying that every single enlightened wisdom captures all objects of knowledge.”617ConclusionFor both Tsongkhapa and Gorampa, enlightenment is the summum bonum of Buddhism—the most sublime wisdom and the perfection of all virtues and spiritual trainings. This chapter showed how Tsongkhapas and Gorampas differences in explaining the nature of the two truths culminate in divergent understandings of enlightenment itself. Giving the two truths equal status, Tsongkhapa argues that enlightenment is the culmination of the simultaneous realizations of the two truths by every single moment of enlightened wisdom. Gorampa, on the other hand, argues for the primacy of ultimate truth and ultimate wisdom over empirical truth and empirical consciousness. Consequently, for him, the achievement of enlightenment is the achievement of nondifferentiated and nondual ultimate truth by ultimate wisdom through transcending empirical truths and empirical consciousness.Enlightenment, according to Tsongkhapa, means seeing empirical truths as they actually are. Knowledge without an empirical grounding is, he"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"ENLIGHTENMENT157argues, flawed and erroneous, and such knowledge cannot be the basis of enlightenment. Knowledge of empirical truths as they are is equivalent to knowing ultimate truth; the two are not contradictory. For Gorampa, enlightenment is precisely freedom from empirical truth and empirical knowledge, which are conditioned by ignorance. Knowing empirical truths and knowing ultimate truth are thus contradictory and independent of one another—indeed, the former has no soteriological significance at all.Ordinary beings, according to Tsongkhapa, have no direct knowledge of empirical truth, for they always reify truth and presuppose the existence of essence. Only noble beings—aryas and buddhas—have direct knowledge of empirical truth, and only buddhas are said to possess simultaneous knowledge of both truths. Indeed this is the distinctive cognitive capacity of an enlightened person. According to Gorampa, however, ordinary beings have direct knowledge of empirical truths, but such knowledge serves no soteriological purpose. In fact, he treats direct knowledge of empirical truths as objects to be negated. Gorampa argues that direct knowledge of empirical truths inhibits arya bodhisattvas (from the eighth to tenth bhumis), arya s'ravakas, and arya pratyekabuddhas from embracing the nondual and transcendent ultimate truth. Only when all the objects of negation are abolished—the entire system of empirical truth and the empir­ical senses—does the sublime wisdom of enlightenment dawn. The distinc­tive cognitive capacity of an enlightened being is, according to Gorampa, the complete transcendence of the empirical world.An enlightened wisdom, in Tsongkhapas view, manifests itself in two modes of knowing that are mutually compatible and mutually reinforcing. Enlightened wisdom knows ultimate truth by way of knowing phenomena as dependently arisen. In such wisdom, and the knowledge associated with it, there remains a duality between subject and object. But because this duality does not comprise even the subtlest misconception, it is not in any way a hindrance. The second mode of knowing by an enlightened wisdom is by way of transcending dualities. This transcendence is, however, strictly epistemological in nature. It operates entirely within the framework of the psychophysical aggregates of the enlightened person, and is in no way a metaphysical transcendence. Gorampa also postulates two modes of know­ing by the enlightened being: knowing from one’s own perspective and knowing from the other’s perspective. But in contrast to Tsongkhapas account, these modes of knowing are fundamentally contradictory. Know­ing from others’ (nonenlightened) perspective is irrelevant to actual enlight­enment and is equated with the knowledge of ordinary beings. Just as"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"158THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEordinary beings reify essence, so does this mode of knowing. However, when an enlightened being knows from his own perspective, then the knowledge is strictly nondifferentiated, nondual, and transcendent. Such knowledge does not allow for any duality between subject and object. Instead a fusion is achieved between metaphysically transcendent ultimate truth and ultimate wisdom. This nondual state is itself considered to be ulti­mate knowledge."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"6. ConclusionTh e r e a r e u n d e n i a b l e similarities that run throughout the phi­losophical systems of Tsongkhapa and Gorampa— they share iden­tical soteriological objectives, employ similar methodologies, employ the same Indian Prasangika Madhyamaka sources, and work within the same linguistic and dialectical conventions. Their disagreement about the nature of the two truths, however, leads them to an equally pervasive set of differences between their two systems. These have been cataloged and summarized in the preceding chapters, and we wont revisit all the separate points of disagreement here. Nonetheless, lets briefly review the major dif­ferences between Tsongkhapas and Gorampas accounts in regard to each of the main areas: soteriology and psychology, ontology, and epistemology, and look at the implications for these on their approach to moral conduct.Soteriology and PsychologyNeither Tsongkhapa nor Gorampa recognizes nirvana as the highest goal. Since both are Mahayana Buddhists, their highest ideal is the bodhisattva ideal of buddhahood for the sake of all beings, rather than the arhathood of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. They also agree that buddhahood, or full enlightenment, culminates with the attainment of the two buddha bodies, the rupakdya—the consequence of the accumulation of moral virtues—and dharmakdya—the consequence of the accumulation of wisdom. However, they each conceive of buddhahood in radically different ways. Even at the level of buddhahood, Tsongkhapa argues for a harmonious relationship between the two truths, while Gorampa insists on the absolute character of ultimate truth and the rejection of conventional truth. Tsongkhapa con­tends that buddhahood provides the most coherent epistemic access to the unity of the two truths, and simultaneous knowledge of the two truths is159"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"i6oTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEpossible only for fully enlightened beings. In contrast, Gorampa maintains that buddhahood severs all connections between the two truths, and those who reach the highest goal access only ultimate truth. For Tsongkhapa, a tathagata—one who achieves the highest goal— is a conventional and dependently arisen phenomenon. For Gorampa, however, whosoever achieves the highest goal is nonempirical and entirely unconditioned. Hence a tathagata for him is a transcendent and nondual being.Tsongkhapa and Gorampa both take the prior attainment of nirvana as one of the essential conditions for the attainment of buddhahood. Tsong­khapa and Gorampa even appear to agree on the psychological transforma­tions that arise as a result of achieving nirvana. The unhealthy psychological dispositions of the ordinary state—samsaric predispositions—are replaced by the healthy psychological dispositions of the liberated state—the attain­ment of nirvana. Samsara, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth driven by suffering, comes to mean psychological bondage, moral corruption, and a state of constant restlessness induced by craving, aversion, and delusion. Nirvana, the end of such suffering, means psychological freedom, and it represents moral perfection as well.For Tsongkhapa nirvana is antithetical to samsara, particularly when the emphasis is placed on their psychological and moral underpinnings. More­over, nirvana is not equated with ultimate truth, nor is samsara equated with conventional truth. Since samsara and nirvana are, in this context, contrasted on the basis of their psychological and moral contents, they cannot be equated with the ontology of the two truths. Samsara represents moral bank­ruptcy, while nirvana represents moral perfection; the former represents psy­chological ills, while the latter represents freedom from such ills. Gorampa, on the other hand, given his commitment to the idea of alayavijnana, which he calls the fundamental root of both samsara and nirvana, appears on a psy­chological level to blur the distinction between samsara and nirvana. Samsara and nirvana are both states of consciousness, as Tsongkhapa would agree, and for Gorampa all states of consciousness have their root in the alaya. Gorampas point is that the samsara-nirvana dichotomy is a duality, and from that perspective both are transcended in ultimate truth—clinging to the dif­ference is an obstacle to the nondual realization.OntologyTsongkhapas ontology treats the two truths as mutually entailing. He argues that they share the same ontological status, and that they are empty"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION161and dependently arisen. The same principle applies to his ontology of samsara and nirvana. Since both samsara and nirvana are dependently arisen and empty, they have equal ontological status. Gorampas ontology treats the two truths as hierarchical and contradictory. He argues that con­ventional truth and ultimate truth each have their own distinct and inde­pendent ontological status. The same distinction is applied in the way he treats samsara and nirvana ontologically. While conventional truth and samsara are treated as dependently arisen, and thus as ontologically condi­tioned Cdus byctSy samskrta), Gorampa argues that ultimate truth and nirvana are ontologically unconditioned Cdus ma byasy asamskrta) and tran­scendent. The spirit of Gorampas transcendent ontology is well expressed in Spiro’s words: “From an ontological point of view, Buddhism [in this case, Gorampa] postulates the existence of two planes which, like parallel lines, never meet. On the one hand there is samsara, the worldly ([Pali:] lokiya) plane; on the other hand there is nirvana, the otherworldly (lokut- tara) or transcendent plane.”618EpistemologyThe two kinds of knowledge, that of conventional truth and that of ulti­mate truth—of samsara and nirvana—are, according to Tsongkhapas epis­temology, complementary. They are yoked together and cannot be isolated from one another. Just as the knowledge of conventional truth depends on that of ultimate truth, so the true knowledge of samsara depends on the realization of nirvana. One who directly knows conventional truth and samsara as dependently arisen and empty thus also knows ultimate truth and nirvana as dependently arisen and empty. Likewise, without knowing ultimate truth and nirvana as dependently arisen and empty, it is not pos­sible to know conventional truth and samsara as dependently arisen and empty. In contrast, according to Gorampas epistemology, knowledge of either of the two truths—of samsara or nirvana— is incompatible with knowledge of the other. The knowledge of conventional truth and samsara as dependently arisen is distinct from knowledge of ultimate truth and nirvana. The knowledge of conventional truth and samsara as dependently arisen is a mundane one based on knowing conventional truth and samsara as ontologically conditioned, whereas the knowledge of ultimate truth and nirvana constitutes transcendent knowledge, since it is based on knowing ultimate truth and nirvana as ontologically transcendent.In terms of the epistemological resources by which the two truths are"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"i6iTHE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEverified, the distinctions are again sharply drawn. Tsongkhapa considers empirically valid cognition and ultimately valid cognition as the two veri­fying consciousnesses. Although empirically valid cognition verifies con­ventional truth and ultimately valid cognition ultimate truth, Tsongkhapa holds that empirically valid cognition does not know conventional truth by itself. Likewise, ultimately valid cognition itself is not a sufficient condition for knowledge of ultimate truth. Coherent knowledge of either truth, Tsongkhapa argues, requires the two verifying consciousnesses to support each other. While Tsongkhapa sees such mutual support between the two cognitive resources as indispensable for developing correct knowledge of both truths, Gorampa adopts a very different approach. He considers igno­rance and wisdom as the two verifying consciousnesses—and he sees those two consciousnesses as contradictory and as operating autonomously.Ethical ImplicationsAlthough this book does not directly explore Tsongkhapas and Gorampas treatment of morality, the comparative analysis of the doctrine of the two truths would be incomplete without some reflection on the ethical impli­cations of the competing perspectives on the two truths. Tsongkhapas com­mitment to the mutually compatible relationship between the two truths and the two corresponding cognitive processes means he is also committed to the mutually compatible relationship between nonconceptual wisdom (meditative equipoise) and conceptual wisdom (postmeditation). He argues that the dualistic cognitive engagements of an enlightened being— practical activities in the world— are consistent with nonconceptual wis­dom. In this way, Tsongkhapa holds that the elements of the threefold training—in morality, concentration, and wisdom—are mutually support­ive. Wisdom arises from a concentrated mind, and a concentrated mind arises from a firm moral foundation. Each element makes its own vital con­tribution to the path.Tsongkhapa maintains that the factors of moral discipline— right speech, right action, and right livelihood—keep the tendencies toward moral trans­gression in check, and thus thwart even the thought of immoral conduct. On this basis, he argues, the three factors of concentration—right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration—firmly anchor the mind and enable the cognitive agent to realize the impermanent, selfless, and empty characteristics of persons and phenomena, leading to the growth of the two"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION163types of penetrating wisdom. First is the unfolding of experiential wis­dom—the experiential right view—which enables the meditator to visual­ize the five aggregates nonconceptually, and thus nondually. Second is the unfolding of conceptual wisdom— the conceptual right view—which enables the cognitive agent to make correct conceptual judgments—onto­logical, moral, and epistemological. The resulting benefits of the develop­ment of the two types of penetrating wisdom show themselves in the purity of psychological, moral, and cognitive states.For Tsongkhapa, the stages of the path are only linear in a metaphorical sense. Morality is not merely a platform to enable some form of soteriolog­ical leap into the ultimate, whereupon one discards it. It is at the heart of the goal itself. The stages of the path and the perfections are cumulative, according to Tsongkhapa, and the beginning and end of spiritual develop­ment must take place within a single beings mental continuum.For all these reasons, Tsongkhapa consistently retains a sharp and clear distinction between moral and immoral conduct, and their consequences, all the way through to the highest spiritual development. In fact, according to Tsongkhapa, a buddha embodies the .highest moral integrity and wis­dom, in both spirit and action. This unity between wisdom and morality arises naturally out of the harmonious relationship between the two truths.The lesser role accorded to morality in Gorampas soteriology is not immediately evident. Like Tsongkhapa, Gorampa affirms the importance of moral conduct as the starting point of the path. The essential disagreement between them emerges only later—in the way they evaluate the role of morality in the path’s advanced stages. Morality and enlightenment, as far as Gorampa is concerned, are discrete. Morality may lead one in the direc­tion of enlightenment, but it must ultimately be discarded before enlight­enment can be attained. Since Gorampa argues that conventional truths are projections of ignorance, conventional practices, including adherence to moral values, must inevitably be seen as objects to be discarded in pursuit of the final realization. Morality, ultimately, is not relevant for the attain­ment of buddhahood, which transcends mundane moral conduct.Gorampas transcendent thesis seems to echo the Buddhas parable of the raft, where the Buddha states that “the Dhamma is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping. Bhikkhus, when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft, you should abandon even the teachings, how much more so things contrary to the teachings.”619 Moreover, since transcendent wisdom as such is seen as identical with ulti­mate truth—which Gorampa characterizes as an absolute that is timeless"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"164THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEand unaffected by change—no amount of moral or immoral activity can influence its basic nature. On this account, morality is gratuitous and with­out soteriological power. In enlightenment, distinctions between good and bad, moral and immoral, and skillful and unskillful lose their validity. Such distinctions are valid only at the conventional level, the level of an ordinary discourse, not the level of a buddhas final realization. This leads to the con­clusion that unethical behaviors are binding on the trainee, but cannot defile the realized being, who is beyond such distinctions.According to this view, the conduct of an enlightened being cannot be circumscribed by moral principles. Having transcended all conventional distinctions of moral and immoral, good and bad, an enlightened being acts spontaneously from his or her intuition of the ultimate nonduality. Com­mitment to a conventional moral code and all that it represents can only inhibit and obstruct the final realization. As Winston King proposes, “ [the enlightened being] must kick away from under him the laboriously built ladder of kammic merit from which he has risen toward sainthood, and take to the transcendental flight on the wings of super-normal (super kammic) wisdom.” The moral virtue itself, “which raises one to such a realm, and the love even of the highest kind of goodness... no matter how much preferable to the love of evil,” explains King, “bind him more subtly and dangerously than before to the realm of time and space, that is, birth, death, and suffer­ing.”620 Morality is seen as a necessary condition for the attainment of enlightenment, but it is also seen, paradoxically, as a hindrance to such attainment. Paradoxical though such a conclusion may appear, it is a natu­ral outgrowth of Gorampas attitudes toward and treatment of conventional truth.The positions on the two truths taken by these two Tibetan Prasangika Madhyamikas are distinct and, finally, irreconcilable. Tsongkhapas com­mitment to the unity between the two truths, and the unity between the two corresponding epistemic pathways, lays the foundation for his entire philosophical system. In contrast, Gorampas commitment to the contra­dictory relationship between the two truths and the respective verifying cognitions leads to significantly different implications. While they both claim to be the heirs of the Indian Prasangika Madhyamaka tradition, their interpretations of the two truths lead to fundamentally different approaches to ontology, epistemology, soteriology, and, not least, morality."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"AbbreviationsAbbreviations for non-Tibetan works appear at the end of this table.Bdag med sgrub rigsBden gnyis gnas jug Bden

Understanding things are as the conventional truth and things are not as the ultimate truth, he treats them as binary opposites, and proposes both things are and things are not as well as things neither are nor are not as the third truth. The third truth is also called the middle truth.

Dreyfus and Sara L. McClintock, eds., The Svatantrika-Prdsangika Distinction: What Difference Does a Difference Make? (Boston: Wisdom Publica­tions, 2003). ln recent book commentators have argued that the doxographical distinction between the Svatantrika and Prasangika Madhyamaka emerged in Tibet in the eleventh to twelfth centuries. See, for example, Jos£ Ignacio Cabez6ns arti­cle, “Two Views on the Svatantrika-Prasangika Distinction in Fourteenth-Century Tibet,” on Tsongkhapa and Gorampas analyses on this matter, pp. 289-315. For more on Tsongkhapas view, see Chizuko Yoshimizu, “Tsongkhapas Reevaluation of Candraklrtis Criticism of Autonomous Inference,” pp. 257—88, as well as D.S. Ruegg’s “Indian and the Indie in Tibetan Cultural History, and Tson khapas Achievement as a Scholar and Thinker: An Essay on the Concepts of Buddhism in Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism,” Journal of Indian Philosophy 32 (2004): 321-43.3 The distinction between the use of Madhyamika versus Madhyamaka is not rigid. However, throughout the book, when the word is used in association with the per­son who holds the view, I use Madhyamika, and when the term is used in associa­tion with the view itself, or the literature, system, or tradition reflecting the view, I tend to use Madhyamaka.4 Most sources agree that the Buddha lived for eighty years some time in the fifth and sixth century B.C .E., but they disagree on his precise date of birth. Theravadins put his birth at around 624 B.C.E., while most Western scholars put it sometime between 566 and 558 B.C.E. For a detailed analysis, see Hirakawa Akira, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Sdkyamuni to Early Mahdydna (Delhi: Motalal Banarsi- dass, 1998), pp. 21-37.171"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"172THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATE5 Nagarjuna is often regarded as the founder of the Mahayana tradition, and of the Madhyamaka school in particular. For the traditional life stories of these Indian adepts, see Taranathas History of Buddhism in India, trans. and ed. by Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1990). Western scholars argue that the Tibetan account of Nagarjunas life conflates the philosopher with a tantric yogi of the same name who lived several centuries later. In the Encyclopedia of Indian Philoso­phies, vol. 8, ed. by Karl H. Potter (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2002), pp. 97-182, Christian Lindtner provides useful summaries of each of Nagarjunas major writings.6 Aryadeva was a contemporary to Nagarjuna and is recognized as the latter s fore­most pupil. TomTillemans has offered the most recent analysis of his life and works in Materials for the Study of Aryadeva, Dharmapala, and Candraklrti (Vienna: Arbeitskreis fur Tibetische und Buddhistische Studien, 1990). See also Karen Lang’s excellent summaries of Aryadeva’s principal works in Potter’s Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, vol. 8.7 Very little is known of Candraklrti s life. The conclusion drawn in Ruegg’s The Lit­erature of the Madhyamaka School of Philosophy in India (Wiesbaden: Otto Harras- sowitz, 1981), p. 228, from the rather scarce evidence available is ca. 600-50.8 I use the term empirically given phenomena— meaning empirically verifiable— as interchangeable with the Tibetan tha snyad du grub pdi chos or tha snyadpdi chos. The intention is to contrast tha snyad du grub pdi chos with kun rdzob kyi chos, which is rendered into English as “conventional phenomena.” Tsongkhapa and Gorampa use both these terms. However, while the latter treats tha snyad du grub pdi chos (or tha snyadpdi chos) and kun rdzob kyi chos as basically the same, the for­mer distinguishes them. For Tsongkhapa, kun rdzob kyi chos is inclusive: it refers not only to empirically given phenomena but also to conceptually constructed phenomena— such as the horn of a rabbit— that are not verifiable through the senses. For Tsongkhapa, tha snyad du grub pdi cho is less inclusive because it excludes all purely conceptually constructed enties. This distinction is crucial for Tsongkhapa. Using this criterion, he differentiates between what is kun rdzob tsam and kun rdzob bden pa. Not all kun rdzob kyi chos, he argues, satisfy the criterion o f kun rdzob bden pa. A rabbit horn, for example, is conceptually constructed with no empirical base and therefore does not necessarily need to be certified by valid cognitions. All tha snyad du grub pdi chos, on the other hand, since they are not merely conceptual projections, do satisfy the criterion of kun rdzob bden pa, and they are all certified by valid cognitions.9 For a brief biographical account of Tsongkhapa, see Don rdor and Bstan ’zin chos grags, Gang Ijongs lo rgyus thog gi grags can mi sna (Bod ljongs mi dmangs Press, 1993), pp. 434-41; a detailed Tibetan biographical account is in Rgyal dbang Chos rje, fam mgon chos kyi rgyal po Tsongkhapa chen pdi mam thar (Sarnath: Gelugpa Students’ Welfare Fund Committee, 2000).

In the Sher ’grel ke ta ka (Sarnath: Nyingmapa Students’ Welfare Committee, 1993), pp. 3-4, 90-92, however, Mipham explicitly endorses the perspective-based division of the two truths. In his article “Would the True Prasangika Please Stand,” in The Svatantrika-Prdsangika Distinction, p. 321, Dreyfus notes the same problem: “despite this openness, Mi pham is in limited agreement with Tsongkhapa, and on many issues he sides with the latter’s critics.” Furthermore, Mipham is an explicit critic of Tsongkhapa. As John Pettit points out in Mipham’s Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1999), p. 136, “Although the substance of Mipham’s and Go ram pa’s critiques of Tsongkhapa and their formulations of Madhyamika systems are for the most part the same, there is a notable difference in tenor.”59 Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen (Rong ston Sakya rgyal tshan), Dbu ma rigs pa’i tsogs kyi dka’ ba’i gnad stan pa rigs lam kun gsal (hereafter, Rigs tsogs dka’gnad) (blockprint, n.d.), f. 7: bden pa gnyis po yang yul la chos gnyis yod pa’i dbang gyis bzhag pa min gyil shes ngo gynis la Itos nas gzhagpa ste//.

According to Cabezon, A Dose of Emptiness, pp. 423-24nio8, the exponents of the doctrine of extrinsic emptiness include Dolpopa, Taranatha, Shakya Chogden, the eighth Karmapa Mikyo Dorj6, and the figures from the ris med ecumenical movement in eastern Tibet. The broadest study of Dolpopa and his legacy is Cyrus Stearns’ The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1999), and Jeffrey Hopkins recently translated Dolpopas masterwork in Mountain Doctrine: Tibet’s Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha-Matrix (Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications, 2006).

In this passage Mipham agrees with Longchen Rabjam, his predecessor, for the latter argues that “From the standpoint of the provisional ultimate (mam grangs kyi don dam) or from the conventional standpoint, the two truths are distinct and incompatible (gcigpa dkagpa’i tha dad).” However, Mipham does not maintain this position consistendy. Elsewhere he argues that the two truths have a single ontological identity but different conceptual identities (ngo bo gcig la Idogpa tha dad) from the standpoint of the nonprovisional ultimate (mam grangs min pa’i don dam).

Note the sentence structure, however. He argues that “if the two truths are ultimately dis­tinct (don dam par tha dad) and conventionally identical (kun rdzob tu gcig))' then there would be four fallacies for each position. Although Mipham’s dialectic seems to be compatible with Tsongkhapas, the underlying assumptions are totally differ­ent. From Mipham’s definitions of the two truths, it is clear that the two truths must not have equal status. If this is unconvincing, see Zla bdi zhal lung, f. 159: mthar ni 'phi don med de bag chags kyi snang ba tsam yin par dngos stobs kyis grub ste/.102 The criticisms Gendun Chopel advances against Tsongkhapas view are considered here primarily as a means to indicate Gendun Chopel’s rejection of the view that holds the mutual compatibility between the two truths. These criticisms are legit­imate from the point of view held by Gorampa, Gendun Chopel, and Tsongkhapas other critics. According to them, the two truths are reducible to ignorance and wis­dom. While for Tsongkhapa, the two truths must not be reducible to ignorance and wisdom since both have their ontological references. Therefore the legitimacy of these criticisms should be understood by having proper perspectives of both sys­tems before applying them directly against Tsongkhapas view.103 Gendun Chopel, Dbu mai zab gnadsnyingpor dril bdi legs bshad klu sgrub dgongs rgyan (hereafter, Klu sgrub dgongs rgyan} (Lhasa: Bod ljongs bod yid dpe rnying khang, 1990), p. 215: bden gnyis zung jug bya ba de 'phags pdi ye shes dang 'jig rten phalpa'i mam rtog gnyis 'gal med zung du 'jugpa’i dus gcig srid na de dus 'ong bar nges kyi gzhan du nam yang srid pa’i skabs med doII.

Were the relationship between the two truths not understood in terms of sub­jective relativity, Rendawa says, he would contradict the definitions of the two truths he provided earlier based on two conflicting perspectives.107 Shakya Chogden maintains that the two truths are inexpressible (brjodpar bya ba mayin pa) in terms of how they relate to each other. They can be expressed neither as identical nor as distinct in terms of their nature. This inexpressibility, he says, applies both in terms of the conventional stance and in terms of the ultimate stance.

His criti­cisms of Tsongkhapa, though, rest on many factors, notably his absolute denial of the very coherence of the so-called “ontological identity” or “single-nature” rela­tionship in the Madhyamaka system. For example, in the Bden gnyis mam gzhag, ff. 31—32, he writes: chos thams cad ngo bo nyid med pa zhes bya ba ’de dbu ma’i lugs yin pa’i phir! de yang dbu ma par rang lugs ’chadpa na kun rdzob kyi rang gi ngo bo ni mam pa thams cad du ’gogpa kho nar nges la! don dam pa’i ngo bo ni gnas skabs gcig tu khas blangs kyang! de ngo bo mtshan nyid pa mayin la/ de yang mthar ’gog pa’i phir! byang chub sems ’grel las/ med na mi ’byung nges pa’i phirI Izhes ’byung ba de yang! kun rdzab kyi ngo bo med pa’i shes byed yin tel gzhung der kun rdzob kyi ngo bo med pa nyid don dam par bshad pa’i phirll.108 Dag brgyudgrub pa’i shing rta, ff. 287-88: kho bo cag dbu ma pa la ni mam par dpyad pa na bden gnyis gzhi grub pa dang ma grub pa gang du’angsmra bsam brjod pa dang dral pa’i phir/ bden gnyis ngo bo gcig dang tha dad gang du’ang rtog par ga la byed ces shes par bya’oll.

A mistaken cognition and an unmistaken cognition are contradictory. For him there is neither a thing that belongs to both categories that can be positively affirmed, nor a thing that does not belong to either of the two categories that can be repudiated. Hence the existence of the third alternative is not possible. Therefore twofold truth is, according to him, a precise enumeration.

Also see p. 70: “In Mahayana we have, on the other hand, a denial of real elements (dharma- nairatmya), and an assertion of the absolute Whole (dharma-kaya). In Hinayana, we have a radical pluralism; in Mahayana, we have a radical monism”; and p. 72: “Just as Mahayana moved towards radical Monism, even so Brahmanism moved towards radical Monism. It is most probable that Mahayana is indebted to some Upanisadic influence.”173 See The Conception of Buddhist Nirvana, p. 19: “...the system of pluralism which is taught in Hinayana and to the monist view which is the central conception of Mahayana.”176 His introductory notes to The Madhyamika Dialectic and the Philosophy of Ndgdr- juna, p. xxvi, state: “In fact, there is only one truth— the Absolute. The other— samvrtisatya, is truth so-called in common parlance, it is totally false from the Absolute standpoint.” And on p. 20: “In early Buddhism they correspond to a plu­ralistic universe, in Mahayana to a monistic”; p. 47: “The Madhyamika system started with an entirely different conception of reality. Real was that possessed as reality of its own (sva-bhava), what was not produced by causes (akrtaka= asamskrta), what was not dependent upon anything else (paratra nirpeksa).”177 Bden gnyis mam gzhag, ff. 15-16: ’phagspa’i mnyam gzhag la Itos nas ni bden pa gcig kyang ma gzhag ste/ des ni bden pa phar zhog gang du yang ma gzhigs pa’i phir ro! /mtharspros pa thams cad dang dral ba’i rjes kyi shes pa la Itos nas ni bden ba gcig kyang ma gzhag ste/ de’i tshe ni shes bya’i mtshan maji snyedpa thams cad brdzun par bzhag dgos pa’i phir roll ...de Itar na mthar thug la Itos nas bden pa mi srid la/ gnas skabs su bden pa mtshan nyid pa don dam pa’i bden pa dang btags pa kun rdzob kyi bden pa’of /de’i shes byed kyang bden ’dzin gyi ngor bden na bden par ’gal pa la thug pa yin no//. Here Shakya Chogden reinforces the idea that ultimate truth is the only real truth from the Madhyamaka standpoint. However ultimate truth is not treated as the absolute truth. “Ultimately,” he says, “it is to be proven false, because every object of knowledge is posited as false.” Although he talks about the conventional truth in great detail, he does not take truth from the Madhyamaka standpoint. Hence his monistic position still stands. Another crucial point to be noted here is his"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"NOTES189categorical rejection of the dual objective basis of the two truths.

The former [conventional truth] is not presented as an un-truth (a-satya) in relation to the latter [ultimate truth], as it would be in an absolutistic tradition. Neither is the former sublated by the latter; there is no indication what­soever that these are two truths with different standing as higher and lower.”181 Empty Words: Buddhist Philosophy and Cross-Cultural Interpretation, pp. 24-25: “This dual thesis of the conventional reality of phenomena together with their lack of inherent existence depends upon the complex doctrine of the Two Truths or Two Realities— a conventional or nominal truth and an ultimate truth— and upon a subtle and surprising doctrine regarding their relation. It is, in fact, this sophistica­ted development of the doctrine of the Two Truths as a vehicle for understanding Buddhist metaphysics and epistemology that is Nagarjunas greatest philosophical contribution.”182 Meditation on Emptiness, pp. 418-19: “ ...the division of the two truths is not an ontological division. Both exist only conventionally (samvrtisat, kun rdzob tu yod pa) with samvrti here referring to a valid dualistic cognizer; both truths exist for valid dualistic cognizers and not in ultimate analysis. The division of the two truths emphasizes two types of objects of consciousness, truths and falsities. Both, how­ever, are falsely existent or falsely established because neither is independent; each depends on its imputing consciousness and on the other...The division into two truths on epistemological grounds is a call to eradicate ignorance and to attain the highest wisdom.”183 Mahdyana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations (London: Routledge, 1996), p. 71: “Conventional and ultimate are not two distinct realities, two realms opposed to each other. It should be clear that the ultimate, emptiness, is what is ultimately the case concerning the object under investigation. It is what makes the object a con­ventional entity and not an ultimate one, as we think it is. Emptiness makes the conventional conventional. Conventional and ultimate are thus not separate.”"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"184 Newland, The Two Truths, p. 6o: “That the two truths are ‘different isolates’ means, for example, that a table and its emptiness can be distinguished in terms of how they are understood by a conceptual consciousness. To say that two things are dif­ferent isolates is to make only the most minimal distinction between them.”185 “Metaphysics for Madhyamikas,” in Dreyfiis and McClintock, eds., The Svdtantrika-Prdsangika Distinction, pp. 114-15: “It is important that samvrtisatya is not misunderstood as being just a purely conventional and arbitary agreement in the way in which the moon’s being called ‘that which has a rabbit’ (sasin) is just a purely conventional agreement. What is true for the world, be it the impermanence of phenomena or the law of cause and effect, is so not just because of simple con­ventional agreements on arbitrary words— whether we are Svatantrika or Prasangika, samvrtisatya is deeper than that.” This statement clearly suggests that Tillemans does not consider samvrtisatya is entirely a projection of one’s mind in that it has an ontological basis.186 Cabezon, A Dose of Emptiness, p. 5i6nii28: “Although having the same referent, they [the two truths] have different names, different designations, being the oppo­sites of different entities qua names.”187 D.S.

I use his term concealer-truth in the context where samvrti is specifically referred to as primal ignorance; however, I do not consider them equivalent. Especially for Tsongkhapa, samvrti carries a much wider application. All phenomenal objects can be described as samvrtisatya but cer­tainly not as concealer-truth, because phenomenal objects themselves do not con­ceal truth. Rather they are the truths. However Newland’s rendition is consistent with Gorampas reading, for in the case of Gorampa, every samvrtisatya amounts to concealing the underlying truth. Phenomena are seen as total illusions.197 Tsongkhapa, Dgongs pa rab gsal, p. 185. Also see Rtsa shes tik chen, p. 403-4.

In this sense it is iden­tical with avidya, the categorizing function of the mind-reasoning. ..It may also mean the mutual dependence of things— their relativity. In this sense it is equated with phenomena, and is in direct contrast with the absolute, which is, by itself, unrelated. The third definition of samvrti is that which is of conventional nature (samketa), depending as it does on what is usually accepted by the common folk (lokavyavahara). ”247 Dgongs pa rab gsal, p. 190: nyon mongs can gyi ma rig pa ni... gal zla mi thun phyogs gangs zag dang chos rang bzhin gis grub par sgro dogs pa’o/L Tsongkhapa maintains that the Prasangikas identification of a deluded concealer (nyon sgrib, klesavaranas) is unique and has to be contrasted with the positions of the Abhidharmikas and even of the Svatantrikas. The Abhidharmikas and Svatantrikas contrast the con­ception of the essence of self, and the conception of essence of phenomena. They categorize only the latter under the umbrella of deluded ignorance and the former under the umbrella of the view of the substantial “I” and “mine” (’jig tshogs la lta ba, satkayadrsti).

The removal, therefore, of jheyavarana is also necessary. This is possible by the realization of dharmanairatmya or dharmasunyata, the egoless­ness and emptiness of all elements of existence.”265 In his article “Madhyamaka,” he argues: “The Madhyamaka school claims to find the true ‘middle way by declaring, not only the unreality of the individuals (pudgala nairatmya), but also the unreality of the dharmas themselves; it denies the existence of not only the beings who suffer, but also of pain.

Paramarthasatya is unsig­nified by language and belongs to the realm of the unutterable, and is experienced by the wise in a very intimate way.” See “Introduction,” Madhyamika Dialectic and the Philosophy o f Nagarjuna, ed. by Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche (Sarnath: CIHTS, I9^5)> p. xxv. In fact, he argues: “There is only one truth— the paramarthasatya, as there is only one real— the Absolute. The other—samvrtisatya, is truth so-called in common parlance, it is totally false from the absolute standpoint.”323 “Phenomena viewed as relative, as governed by causes and conditions, constitute the world, and viewed as free of all conditions are the Absolute. The Absolute is always of uniform nature. Nirvana or the Absolute is not something produced or achieved. Nirvana only means the disappearance of the fabrications of discursive thought... Phenomena are appearances, and appearances point to their Reality. The veil gives a hint of that which is veiled.” See “Introduction,” The Conception of Buddhist Nirvana, pp. 51-52. Ultimate truth in his sense is the only truth, “the Absolute as the essence of all being is neither born, nor does it cease to be...it is the reality of the appearances.”324 See “Madhyamaka” in Madhyamika Dialectic and the Philosophy of Nagarjuna, pp. 152—53, where he equates conventional dharmas with the daughter of a barren woman, and with the hairs that a monk with diseased eyes thinks he sees in his alms bowl, and argues “the object described, the description, and the person describing are all similarly nonexistent.” Absolute truth, which, as he argues “is ‘knowledge of Buddha,’ is a ‘not-knowledge’;” it is like a man without diseased eyes who does not see hairs.323 See Huntington’s translation of the verse [6:23] of the Madhyamakavatara and compare it to his notes on the same verse in The Emptiness of Emptiness, p. 231-32038. He defines ultimate truth as an object of wisdom, which is revealed through accurate perception. He argues that conventional truth is an object obtained “on the strength of false perceptions made by common people in whom"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"NOTES203the eye of intelligence has been completely covered by the cataract of spiritual igno­rance.

Among the four means of knowledge (pramdnas), his epistemology clearly discounts inferential knowledge (rjes dpad, anumdna), analogy (dpe nyer jal, upamana), and verbal testimony (lung, sabda) as means of knowing ultimate truth. For him they are only means of knowing con­ventional truth, for they are all conceptual. He considers direct perception (mngon sum,pratyaksa) alone as the means of knowing ultimate truth. For more details, see ’Jugpa’i dka gnad, ff. 460-65, 466-70, 475.356 His analysis of the epistemic practices within the Prasangika excludes the use of logical inference as a means of knowing ultimate truth.

Also see ff. 269-72. He expressly argues that the notion of pramana, “valid” knowledge, is inappropriate in the Madhyamaka tradition.

In commenting on the sixth chapter of Santidevas Bodhicaryavatdra, Mipham categorically rules out the possibility of knowing ultimate truth by conceptual mind. This claim is reinforced in his response (Shes ’grel ke ta ka, pp. 9-10) to his critics. Mipham’s claim, how­ever, should not be taken too far. For he not only accepts ultimate truth as an object of knowledge by the nonconceptual mind or by direct personal realization (Nges shes rinpo che’ sgron me [hereafter, Nges shes sgron me]. The Collected Writings, vol. 8 [Gangtok: Sonam Topgyal Kazi, 1976], ff. 82-87, 9^)> but he also argues that the conceptual-linguistic device offers us “mere understanding that all conventional realities are utterly false.” See Mipham, Dbu ma rtsa ba’i mchan ’grelgnas lugs rab gsal (hereafter, Dbu rtsa’i mchan ’grel), The Collected Writings, vol. 1 (Gangtok: Sonam Topgyal Kazi, 1979), f. 217: jig rten tha snyad kyi rjessu ’drang nas de’i mtshan nyid brjod cig ci na! rtags dpe sogs bzhan gis bstan pas ji bzhin shes mi nus te rab rib can la de med par bstan pas rab rib med par lta Itar ngo bo ma mthong pa’i tshul kyis rtogs byaji lta ba rtogs mi nus kyang/ de phyin ci log go bya ba tsam gzhig rtog go!I.358 Klu sgrub dgongs rgyan, p. in : ji srid ’jig rten gyi rigs pa la snying thag pa nasyid ches yod pa de srid du jig rten las ’das pa’i do layid ches yod pa nam yang mi srid de... jig rten gyi rigs pa layid ches dgos na lam bsgom pa don med par ’gyur ba’i rgyu mtshan du bcom Idan ’das kyis mig dang ma ba sogs nas ’phags pa’i lam bya ba’i dbang po bzhan zhig yod par gsungs...//. In this polemic Gendun Chopel unleashes severe criticisms against the philosophy ofTsongkhapa. Gendun Chopel renders the reasoning con­sciousness as utterly useless in terms o f understanding ultimate reality. At the heart of his rejection of pramana lies his equation of perception with the conception of true existence.

For details see pp. 438-40.360 “Ordinary beings,” he says, “by means of following the inferential reasoning con­sciousness, ascertain [ultimate reality].” See Grub mtha’ mdzod, f. 196: don dam bden pa nges par byed pa’i tshad ma ni dpyad bzod mthar thug dpyodpa’i rig pa’i bzhal bya nges par byed pa’i tshad ma pa thob nas so so ranggi rig pa’i mam par mi rtog pa’i ye shes kyis rtogs na’ang! so so skye bo de dag gyis gtan tshigs kyi rjes su ’brang ba’i rigs shes rjes dpaggi nges par byed doll.361 Logical reasoning, as far as he is concerned, is an indispensable device for the direct realization of ultimate reality. In sharp contrast with most of his followers, such as Gorampa and Shakya Chogden, Sakya Pandita holds that even ordinary beings possess the reasoning consciousness that could conceptually access ultimate real­ity. See Gzung lugs legs bshad, p. 72b: don dam bden pa’i ngo bo ni! rigs pa yul dang bcos pa ste! rigs pa ni sangs rgyas kyi ye shes dang! byang chub sems dpa’ mams kyis mnyam par bzhag pa’i shes pa dang! so so skye bo’i gcig dang du dral la sogs pa’i spros pa gcod byed kyi rigs pa yin la! rig pai yul ni rigs pa des gtan las phap pa’am! des rtogs pa’i chos mams kyis chos nyid spros pa dang dral ba’o!!.362 Closely following in the footsteps of Sakya Pandita, in Rigs tsogs dka’gnad, f. 22, Rongton also differentiates between the reasoning consciousness analyzing con­ventional truth and that analyzing ultimate truth. And he argues that the “knowl­edge generated from the contemplation has the same continuum as the meditation, because the meaning (don) established by the means of analytical process is itself further processed through the meditative equipoise.” See Rigs tsogs dka’gnad, f. 105: bsam byung dang sgom byung yang rtogs pa’i rigs rgyun gcig ste! bsam byung gis gtan la phabs pa’i don de nyid la sgom byung gis kyang mnyam par jog ba’i phyir ro! de la bsam byung ni rta’i dkyus bstan pa Itar yin la! sgom byung ni de las brten nas rta thogs med du rgyugpa bzhin yin no!!. Rongton, however, admits the limits of inference and maintains that it is mistaken insofar as the inferential cognition mistakes the uni­versal of selflessness as selflessness itself. However, inference, he argues, paves the way for an eventual eradication of the conception of self. In the Rigs tsogs dka’gnad, f. 105, he says: gal te rjes dpag ni log shes yin pas des rtogs pa’i rigs rgyun goms pas phyin ci ma log pa’i rtogs pa skye baji Itar ’gyur zhe na! bdag med pa’i don spyi la spyi’i bdag med du zhen pa’i cha nas ’khrulpa’i phyir de’i ’dzin stangs kyi cha nas goms par byed pa mayin las! ’on kyang yul bdag med du gnas pa Itar rjes dpag kyang bdag med pa’i mam ba can du skye ba’i ’dzin stangs kyi cha nas phyin cin ma logpa dang rjes su mthun pa’i phyir de’i ’dzin stangs kyi cha nas goms par byas pas bdag ’dzin log nas bdag med mngon du rtogs pa’i rtogs pa skye ba’i phyir nges ba ga las yod//. Moreover Rongton criticizes the view that denies the role of inference as the epistemic means by which ultimate reality can be eventually accessed directly (Rigs tsogs dka’gnad, f. 39: rjes dpag la rigs shes su mi dod na rigs pa la rten nas sgro 'dog gcod byed kyi bio min par"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"NOTES207’gyur roll). He equates inference and the reasoning consciousness, and argues that the denial of the epistemic role of inference would be tantamount to denying ana­lytical cognitions altogether.

In other words, (a) in-expressible in human language, (b) that ‘is,’ not is,’ ‘both is and not is,’ ‘neither is nor not is’— no thought category or predicate can be applied to it. It is transcendence of thought.”394 We should not, however, take the similarity between Gorampa and his modern counterparts too far. The (nontraditional) reading of Nagarjuna, in my view, is a consequence of equating Nagarjuna’s ultimate reality with either the Kantian absolute or the Upanisadic Brahman as neti, neti. For example, Murti, The Cen­tral Philosophy of Buddhism, p. 38, writes: “The similarity of the avydkrta to the celebrated antinomies of Kant and the catuskoti of the Madhyamikas cannot fail to strike us.” Moreover he says, p. 48: “A close parallel...is the Upanisadic way of defining ‘neti, neti,’ as what cannot be grasped by speech, thought or senses.” Similarly, Harsha Narain, “The nature of Madhyamika thought,” in S. Rin­poche, ed., The Madhyamika Dialectic and the Philosophy of Nagarjuna (Sarnath: CIH TS, 1985), p. 239, sees Madhyamikas as Kantians insofar as they share the notion of “innate incapacity of human reason to reach the Absolute.” Jaideva Singh, in the introduction to Theodore Stcherbatsky, The Conception of Buddhist Nirvana (Delhi: Motilal Banarasidass, 1989), pp. 48, 72, however, focuses on the connections between the Brahma and Is'vara of Vedanta and the dharmadhatu and dharmakaya of the Madhyamaka. Stcherbatsky, p. 26, also draws parallels emphasizing the transcendent character of advaita-brahman, particularly the connection between the Buddhas silence on the metaphysical question and Sankara’s silence on the issue about the essence of Brahman. I partly agree that there are parallels in the explanatory mode of the Madhyamaka’s ultimate real­ity, the Kantian absolute, and the Upanisadic Brahman, specifically the incapac­ity of logical mind to grasp these. However, I also partly disagree. Except for the dialectical parallels, there is minimal intersection between the Madhyamaka’s"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"210THE TWO TRUTHS DEBATEultimate reality (especially Tsongkhapas) with either the Kantian absolute or Upanisadic Brahman.395 Murti, Madhyamika Dialectic and the Philosophy of Nagarjuna, p. xi.396 Narain, “The Nature of Madhyamika,” in S.

It usually means a tendency of thoughts to proliferate based on a false sense of self. It is therefore frequently used in analyses of the discord between things as we perceive them and things as they are, as the Buddha himself does in such dis­courses as the Sakka-panha Sutta (DN 21), the Madhupindika Sutta (MN 18), and the Kalaha-vivada Sutta (SN 4.11). Although this term is variously translated as “self-reflexive thinking,” “reification,” “falsification,” “distortion,\" “elaboration,”"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"NOTES213or “exaggeration,” I opted for “conceptual elaboration” to emphasize the role of conception in prapanca.445 See www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/majjhima/index.html for Thanissaro Bhikkus notes on Madhupindika Sutta [MN 18]. See also his mapping of the causal chain that gives rise to prapanca and that eventually leads to conflict. The presentation is somewhat linear, but the reality is much more complex and “provides plenty of room for feedback loops.” It prevents, however, the explanation of causation as ran­dom, coincidental, accidental, or divine.446 Ibid.447 Ibid.448 Ibid.449 Rtsa she tik chen, pp. 322-23: 0 nagangzadpas las nyon zadpar 'gyur snyam naJ khor bar skye ba’i las nyon ni nyon mongs las skye la nyon mongs kyang sdug mi sdug dang phyin ci loggi tshul min yid byed kyi rnam rtog las 'byung gi ngo bo nyid kyis yod pa min noil tshul min yid byed kyi mam rtog de dag ni shes pa dang shes bya dang rjod bya dang rjod byed dang bum snam dang skyes pa dang bud med dang! myed ma rnyed la sogs pa la bden par zhen pa’i spros pa sna tshogs pa thog med nas goms pa las skyes’o/ bden ’dzin gyi spros pa niyul de rnams stong pa nyid du lta ba goms pas gags par ’gyur roll.

Sakya Pandita, Thub pa dgongs gsal, pp. 24d-25c, in a brief historical account of the origin of Hva Shangs view in Tibet, argues that this view prevailed during the reign of the Tibetan king Trisong Deutsan (790—845 C.E.); Hva Shang Mahayana was held responsible for propagating this view in Tibet. Eventually he was defeated by the Indian pandita Kamalas'lla in the great Samye debate and was forced to return to China. His con­troversial doctrine, sometimes referred to as quietism, emphasizes stilling thought and speculative analysis in order to attain tranquillity. It is also said that this doc­trine dismisses the moral aspects of spiritual practice.506 Nges shes sgron me, f. 83: kha cig cir yang mi dzin zerl cir yang mi dzhin zer ba’i don/... dran med hwa shang lugs! ma dpyad tse ner bzhag bayes! lhag mthong gsal ba’i cha med par! mtsho gting rdo bzhin tha mai gnas... //.507 Nges shes sgron me, ff. 84, 87: ma mthong stong par rtogs shes na! chos tshul shin tu zab pa ste! sems ni gzugs can ma yin pas! /sus kyang mdog sogs mthong mi srid!

Contemplatives promote their various personal truths, that’s why they do not say one thing and the same. But why do they say various truths, those who say they are skilled? Have they learned various truths or do they follow conjecture? Apart from their perception there are not many various constant truths in the world.

For oth­ers rjes thob means “aftermath of mnyam gzhag” which is translated as “postmedi­tation.” For Tsongkhapa rjes thob means “subsequent attainment.” It does not mean the aftermath of the meditative equipoise— in the sense of of occurring after­ward; rather it means “an attainment due to the power of meditative equipoise, or what is being generated from it.” See Dgongs pa rab gsal p. 459: rjes la thob pa zhes pai rjes kyi don nil mnyam gzhag las langs pai rjes zhes dus snga phyii rjes min gyi mnyam gzhag dei stobs kyis thobpa/am byung bai don noil.
